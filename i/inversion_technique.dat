Based on the probabilistic view {{point for the}} input constellations, the optimal probability distribution for the data vectors in the channel <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques</b> is found. We have also introduced a theoretical Selective Mapping (SLM) technique (based on random coding arguments) in channel <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques</b> to reduce the transmit average energy. The asymptotic gain that the SLM technique can provide is derived. The proposed technique results in a significant saving in energy as the corresponding shaping gain can be {{much higher than the}} upper bound of 1. 53, known for the conventional shaping. The exact gain depends on the orthogonality defect of the channel. I...|$|R

50|$|An {{example of}} a post-stack seismic {{resolution}} <b>inversion</b> <b>technique</b> is the Constrained Sparse-Spike Inversion (CSSI).

The model generated is of higher quality, and does not suffer from tuning and interference caused by the wavelet.|$|E
40|$|National audienceIn {{the last}} decade, the inverse {{characterization}} of the macroscopic parameters of acoustic porous materials has increased in popularity due to its simplicity. Different techniques in the frequency and time domains have been proposed using ultrasound and audio frequencies. These techniques {{can be divided into}} two categories: iterative inversion and non-iterative <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques.</b> For both categories, the precursor model on which the inversion applies is generally based on an equivalent fluid theory where the porous medium is assumed homogeneous and acoustically rigid or limp. During experimentations, these assumptions may not be verified and other problems related to boundary conditions, measurement quality, and applicability of the precursor model can occur. Without any precautions, one can easily understand that applying <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques</b> can then yield non- physical macroscopic parameters. After giving an overview of the different acoustical <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques,</b> this presentation addresses the importance of defining some guidelines to ensure a better use of the <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques,</b> mainly those based on impedance tube measurements in the audio-frequency range. These guidelines are used to address some case studies on materials for which inversion works and for some others where it fails...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{show the}} {{potential}} of machine learning regarding the task of underwater source localization through a fluctuating ocean. Underwater source localization is classically addressed under the angle of <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques.</b> However, because an inversion scheme is necessarily based on {{the knowledge of the}} environmental parameters, it may be not well adapted to a random and fluctuating underwater channel. Conversely, machine learning only requires using a training database, the environmental characteristics underlying the regression models. This makes machine learning adapted to fluctuating channels. In this paper, we propose to use non linear regressions for source localization in fluctuating oceans. The kernel regression as well as the local linear regression are compared to typical <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques,</b> namely Matched Field Beamforming and the algorithm MUSIC. Our experiments use both real tank-based and simulated data, introduced in the works of Real et al. Based on Monte Carlo iterations, we show that the machine learning approaches may outperform the <b>inversion</b> <b>techniques...</b>|$|R

50|$|We {{start with}} an example to invert for earth {{parameter}} values from temperature depth distribution in a given earth region. Although this example does not directly relate to seismic inversion since no traveling acoustic waves are involved, it nonetheless introduces practical application of the <b>inversion</b> <b>technique</b> in a manner easy to comprehend, {{before moving on to}} seismic applications. In this example, the temperature of the earth is measured at discrete locations in a well bore by placing temperature sensors in the target depths. By assuming a forward model of linear distribution of temperature with depth, two parameters are inverted for from the temperature depth measurements.|$|E
50|$|The model <b>inversion</b> <b>technique</b> above {{can be used}} as {{a method}} of {{determining}} whether a model can be improved. In this case selection of nonzero terms is not so important and linear prediction can be done using the significant eigenvectors of the regression matrix. The values in A determined in this manner need to be substituted into the nonlinear model to assess improvements in the model errors. The absence of a significant improvement indicates the available data is not able to improve the current model form using the defined parameters. Extra parameters can be inserted into the model to make this test more comprehensive.|$|E

50|$|Irrespective of the {{variable}} to be inverted for, the earth’s impedance is a continuous function of depth (or time in seismic data) and for numerical linear <b>inversion</b> <b>technique</b> {{to be applicable}} for this continuous physical model, the continuous properties have to be discretized and/or sampled at discrete intervals along {{the depth of the}} earth model. Thus, the total depth over which model properties are to be determined is a necessary starting point for the discretization. Commonly, as shown in Fig. 3, this properties are sampled at close discrete intervals over this depth to ensure high resolution of impedance variation along the earth’s depth. The impedance values inverted from the algorithm represents the average value in the discrete interval.|$|E
