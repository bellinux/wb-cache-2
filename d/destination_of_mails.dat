25|$|For instance, an {{individual}} {{keeping track of}} the amount <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> they receive each day may notice that they receive an average number of 4 letters per day. If receiving any particular piece <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> does not affect the arrival times of future pieces <b>of</b> <b>mail,</b> i.e., if pieces <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> {{from a wide range of}} sources arrive independently of one another, then a reasonable assumption is that the number <b>of</b> pieces <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> received in a day obeys a Poisson distribution. Other examples that may follow a Poisson include the number of phone calls received by a call center per hour and the number of decay events per second from a radioactive source.|$|R

This study analyzes the environmental costs and benefits <b>of</b> direct <b>mail.</b> Our analysis indicates that the environmental benefits <b>of</b> direct <b>mail,</b> although hard to quantify precisely, are far greater than the costs. To set a context for the discussion of environmental costs and benefits, we begin with a discussion of the composition <b>of</b> direct <b>mail.</b> The majority <b>of</b> direct <b>mail</b> is mailed at Standard (A) rates (previously referred to as Third-Class rates).

5000|$|Gousset was a {{component}} of late Medieval armor. During the transition from mail to plate armor, sections <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> covered parts <b>of</b> the body that were not protected by steel plate. These sections <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> were known as gousset. Gousset came into use in the fourteenth century as plate became a structural part of a suit of knightly armor rather than an addition strapped over a suit <b>of</b> <b>mail.</b> During the fourteenth century there was considerable variation in the ratio of gousset to plate.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} two threads in {{the history}} <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art: a networking approach dedicated to open participation and a crafted approach dedicated to the art object. It then follows these two threads across three generations. Mail art is an international phenomenon that evolved over the past sixty odd years due {{to the efforts of}} a dedicated and growing group of individuals. American artist Ray Johnson and the international artistic group operating under the banner of Fluxus are discussed as establishing mail art as a separate form through their creation <b>of</b> the <b>mail</b> art network. The generation that followed Johnson and Fluxus expanded on the free and open ethos <b>of</b> the <b>mail</b> art network, making it a cornerstone <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art practice and embracing new technology. Finally, this study examines work by contemporary mail artists who have not yet been historicized and who return to a craft approach in the production <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art. Using Glenn Adamson 2 ̆ 7 s theory of craft, this thesis concludes that craft is an equally pertinent aspect <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art practice and that, although it is underemphasized in mail art 2 ̆ 7 s first two generations, it is a dominant factor in the production <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> art today...|$|R
