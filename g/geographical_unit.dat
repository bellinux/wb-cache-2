40|$|The {{concept of}} {{neighborhood}} remains important in criminology, {{in particular in}} relation to the social disorganization school of thought and its subsequent development into collective efficacy theory. Most neighborhood based studies make use of administrative <b>geographical</b> <b>units</b> such as census tracts although it is widely recognized as problematic due to the potential mismatch between the boundaries of administrative <b>geographical</b> <b>units</b> and boundaries of real importance to people or mechanisms of interest. This is called the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP), which consist both of problems of scale (size of neighborhoods) and of zonation (boundary placement). In the present study data over arson from the Swedish rescue services 2007 - 2012 have been employed to analyze MAUP in the city of Malmö. It is argued that arson is a form of physical disorder that is strongly related to social disorganization. The analysis is based on a comparison of administrative <b>geographical</b> <b>units</b> of analysis compared to randomly generated <b>geographical</b> <b>units</b> of similar size. In the analysis both SAMS-areas (n= 391) and part-areas (n= 136) are considered alongside a total of 40 sets of randomly generated <b>geographical</b> <b>units</b> of similar size. The city has been divided into 50 * 50 meter micro-places (n= 64544) which have been assigned a value for arson based on incidence, kernel density and distance to nearest arson. Empty two-level hierarchical linear regression models with the micro-places as level 1 unit have been employed to calculate Intra-Class Correlations (ICC) separately for each of the 42 different <b>geographical</b> <b>units</b> of analysis as level 2 units. Results show that administrative <b>geographical</b> <b>units</b> of analysis in many cases just are marginally better than <b>geographical</b> <b>units</b> with random borders if the basic urban structure is taken into account.

In the present study data over arson from the Swedish rescue services 2007 - 2012 have been employed to analyze MAUP in the city of Malmö, Sweden. The city has been divided into 50 * 50 meter pixels as micro-places (n= 64540) which have been assigned a value for arson from frequency of arson within the pixel.

30|$|The {{generation}} of districting plans {{is based on}} atomic <b>geographical</b> <b>units.</b> There are some existing <b>geographical</b> <b>units</b> such as police beats or census blocks. Usually, these <b>geographical</b> <b>units</b> consider administrative boundaries, important roads, or some natural boundaries (mountains, rivers). The redistricting procedure can start from these units and re-group them into several districts. When developing districting plans for large areas containing hundreds of such <b>geographical</b> <b>units,</b> police beats or census blocks are good choices for atomic units. However, some cities only have 20 or 30 census blocks. Police beats or census blocks are not small enough for optimal patrol boundaries. In such case, grid network can be used instead. The city {{can be divided into}} several hundreds of grids and they are small enough to be atomic units. Clearly, more atomic units represent more possible districting plans. Such representation is more suitable for systematic and scientific study of districting problem. The output districting plans based on grid boundaries can be adjusted according to existing boundaries such as important roads, administrative boundaries and natural boundaries.|$|R

40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this study}} is to explore how the zonation and scale {{problems}} of the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) impact on the proportion of variance associated with surrounding areas in relation to micro-place levels of arson. MAUP is related to how geographical areas are constructed, with zonation related to how boundaries are drawn, and scale related to the size of areas. Methods Arson point data from 2007 to 2011 are analyzed by means of hierarchical linear modeling in order to compute intra-class correlations (ICCs), the share of variance associated with the higher order <b>geographical</b> <b>units,</b> for <b>geographical</b> <b>units</b> of three different sizes and with three degrees of randomness. Real, administrative, <b>geographical</b> <b>units</b> of two sizes, with mean size of 1. 2 and 0. 4 square kilometers respectively, are compared both to semi-random and fully-random artificial <b>geographical</b> <b>units</b> of the same size, and to smaller types of units of 0. 17 square kilometer size. Results The analysis shows that there is little difference between large and mediumsized <b>geographical</b> <b>units,</b> but there is a significant increase in the ICC at the smallest geographical scale. To understand the geography of arson this suggests that the smallest types of units are of the greatest importance. As regards the problem of zonation, the results show that more randomness of boundary placement is associated with lower ICCs. Conclusion A key implication of these findings is that community preventive efforts may best be targeted at very small communities such as street blocks rather than larger neighborhoods...|$|R
