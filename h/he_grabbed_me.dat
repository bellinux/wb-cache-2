Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, [...] "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving." [...] One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a [...] "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, [...] "I was just scared to death. My husband and I were in the house. The Venetian shades began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>me</b> and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. I was so scared. I did not know I was scared." [...] People in the community of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was [...] "in a car... to Evansville and didn't know about it until we got there".|$|E

She later claimed that other incidents of physical abuse occurred in her marriage sporadically, but intensified after her husband lost his job at Borg Warner Automotive. She stated that [...] "Bob would shove. That's what he liked to do, shove and push against walls.

He's essentially a pastiche of classic Jackie Chan roles from movies like Drunken Master and Supercop, which I first watched in college. But I recently realized that my affinity for Lei goes deeper than those pop cultural resonances. The thing I love most about Lei Wulong is the fluidity of his moveset. … Lei's a dancer, the kind of martial artist I like to pick in fighting games. Maybe that's why I enjoy Lei's loose, improvisatory style. —Evan Narcisse, Kotaku, 2012 The character has received mostly positive reception from various gaming media outlets. Dave Cook of VG247 stated that Lei's [...] "multi-stance move set" [...] in Tekken 2 [...] "delivered incredible depth that was foreign to the fighting genre at the time." [...] Scott Tailford of WhatCulture wrote in 2017: [...] "Lei Wulong has truly {{been one of the most}} beloved Tekken fighters in the franchise's history. His blend of multi stance-switching combat, slick story as a Hong Kong cop and traditional Japanese dress really resonated with the fanbase, resulting in one of the most technical characters the franchise has ever seen. ... Katsuhiro Harada even tweeted multiple times in response to fans, acknowledging the love and need for him to come back." [...] UGO Networks placed Lei among the 50 [...] "greatest fictional detectives of all time" [...] in 2008, describing him as [...] "the longtime star of the Tekken franchise". Kevin Wong of Complex named Lei the eighth-best Tekken character in 2013. Lei's Tekken Tag Tournament 2 ending features him and Marshall Law engaging in a violent sparring session at Law's restaurant; based on the characters' resemblances to Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee, respectively, 4thletter.net ranked it 163rd in their 2003 list of [...] "The Top 200 Fighting Game Endings": [...] "Lei is an action cop … while Law is a mediocre chef with a taste for get-rich-quick schemes. Still, such a match-up is hard to resist and Tekken Tag 2 gives us just that." ...|$|R

Then the big savage began to rave and <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>me</b> up in his arms. He smothered me; almost crushed {{the life out of}} me. He frightened me terribly. When I got away from him--the monster stood there and coolly said I belonged to him. I ran {{out of the room and}} wouldn't see him any more.

60|$|But to {{come back}} to the river. Food was plentiful, principally berries and {{succulent}} roots, and on the river bank we played and lingered for days. And then the idea came to Lop-Ear. It was a visible process, the coming of the idea. I saw it. The expression in his eyes became plaintive and querulous, and he was greatly perturbed. Then his eyes went muddy, as if he had lost his grip on the inchoate thought. This was followed by the plaintive, querulous expression as the idea persisted and he clutched it anew. He looked at me, and at the river and the far shore. He tried to speak, but had no sounds with which to express the idea. The result was a gibberish that made me laugh. This angered him, and <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>me</b> suddenly and threw me on my back. Of course we fought, and in the end I chased him up a tree, where he secured a long branch and poked me every time I tried to get at him.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was left}} to vain conjectures, however, as to Roderick's actual moods and occupations. He knew he was no letter-writer, and that, in the young sculptor's own phrase, he had at any time rather build a {{monument}} than write a note. But when a month had passed without news of him, he began to be half anxious and half angry, and wrote him three lines, {{in the care of}} a Continental banker, begging him at least to give some sign of whether he was alive or dead. A week afterwards came an answer--brief, and dated Baden-Baden. [...] "I know I have been a great brute," [...] Roderick wrote, [...] "not to have sent you a word before; but really I don't know what has got into me. I have lately learned terribly well how to be idle. I am afraid to think how long it is since I wrote to my mother or to Mary. Heaven help them--poor, patient, trustful creatures! I don't know how to tell you what I am doing. It seems all amusing enough while I do it, but it would make a poor show in a narrative intended for your formidable eyes. I found Baxter in Switzerland, or rather he found me, and <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>me</b> by the arm and brought me here. I was walking twenty miles a day in the Alps, drinking milk in lonely chalets, sleeping as you sleep, and thinking it was all very good fun; but Baxter told me it would never do, that the Alps were 'd----d rot,' that Baden-Baden was the place, and that if I knew what was good for me I would come along with him. It is a wonderful place, certainly, though, thank the Lord, Baxter departed last week, blaspheming horribly at trente et quarante. But you know all about it and what one does--what one is liable to do. I have succumbed, in a measure, to the liabilities, and I wish I had some one here to give me a thundering good blowing up. Not you, dear friend; you would draw it too mild; you have too much of the milk of human kindness. I have fits of horrible homesickness for my studio, and I shall be devoutly grateful when the summer is over and I can go back and swing a chisel. I feel as if nothing but the chisel would satisfy me; as if I could rush in a rage at a block of unshaped marble. There are a lot of the Roman people here, English and American; I live in the midst of them and talk nonsense from morning till night. There is also some one else; and to her I don't talk sense, nor, thank heaven, mean what I say. I confess, I need a month's work to recover my self-respect." ...|$|E

You cannot understand, you two young men, what agonies I suffered. The thing was done. It was irrevocable. I saw how Clarence valued the picture. I knew that I could never bring myself to ask him for it back. And yet I was lost without it. What could I do? Till this evening I could see no hope. Then came this story of the theft of the Romney from a house quite close to this, and I saw my way. Clarence would never suspect. He would put the robbery down to the same band of criminals who stole the Romney. Once the idea had come, I could not drive it out. I fought against it, but to no avail.

Moving to Gainesville, Florida at 18, she began {{performing}} as Against Me!, either alone on an acoustic guitar or with friend Kevin Mahon accompanying by drumming on pickle buckets. Her songs drew influence from early acoustic protest music, covering topics such as class struggle. Early Against Me! shows were played at dive bars, laundromats, and anywhere else that would allow Grace to perform, to audiences of a few or even zero. Making ends meet by working odd jobs, dumpster diving, selling blood plasma, and living in a low-rent house with twelve roommates across the street from an experimental waste dump, Grace also volunteered with nonprofit socialist groups such as Food Not Bombs. She was arrested again at 18 for obstruction of justice and resisting arrest without violence: [...] "I was picking up Mahon. He was like, 'Pop the trunk—I want to throw some stuff in there.' I was waiting in the car and I saw two cop cars come up behind me. I got out and they had my friend on the ground.

There were only Georgians there, women, children and men. There were some women who were pregnant, and children of different ages. The Battalion of Cossacks kept coming there regularly. They took young girls and children and raped them systematically. These were children aged 10, 12, 13, and 14. They especially targeted children. One of the girls there was 8 years old. She was taken by different groups of these Cossacks and was raped numerous times. I don't know how she managed to survive after so many rapes but I don't want to mention her name in order to protect her identity. They also took women but later they started to take elderly women.
