25|$|Independent {{component}} analysis (ICA) is another signal processing solution that separates different signals that are statistically independent in time. It is primarily used to remove artifacts such as blinking, eye muscle movement, <b>facial</b> <b>muscle</b> artifacts, cardiac artifacts, etc. from MEG and EEG signals {{that may be}} contaminated with outside noise. However, ICA has poor resolution of highly correlated brain sources.|$|E
25|$|Biofeedback {{therapy for}} facial synkinesis aims to {{increase}} the patient’s awareness of the <b>facial</b> <b>muscle</b> posture and movement. Facial muscles contain few to none intrinsic muscle sensory receptors (used for proprioceptive feedback) and additionally they do not span movable joints and so lack joint receptors (another source for proprioceptive feedback). Thus, biofeedback allows the patient to actively sense the motion of their muscles. The two common forms of biofeedback used are electromyographic feedback and mirror feedback. Electromyographic feedback includes visual EMG signals (coming from <b>facial</b> <b>muscle</b> sites displayed to the patient from a computer {{in the form of}} waveform traces) or auditory signals that indicate strength of muscle contraction. The subsequent role of the patient is to control the movement of undesired muscle during volitional movement by incorporating the information perceived through the EMG. While mirror feedback is a much more basic way of providing the patient feedback on muscle movement, studies have shown that both are very effective options for synkinesis/paresis reduction. Biofeedback is commonly coupled to facial retraining techniques to achieve maximal effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|There are 24 main mudras, and {{numerous}} more minor ones in Kathakali. There are nine facial expressions called Navarasas, which each actor masters through <b>facial</b> <b>muscle</b> control during his education, {{in order to}} express the emotional state of the character in the play. The theory behind the Navarasas is provided by classical Sanskrit texts such as Natya Shastra, but sometimes with different names, and these are found in other classical Indian dances as well. The nine Navarasas express nine Bhava (emotions) in Kathakali as follows: Sringara expresses Rati (love, pleasure, delight), Hasya expresses Hasa (comic, laugh, mocking), Karuna expresses Shoka (pathetic, sad), Raudra expresses Krodha (anger, fury), Vira expresses Utsaha (vigor, enthusiasm, heroic), Bhayanaka expresses Bhaya (fear, concern, worry), Bibhatsa expresses Jugupsa (disgust, repulsive), Adbhuta expresses Vismaya (wondrous, marvel, curious) and Shanta expresses Sama (peace, tranquility).|$|E

His skin perspired; and his eyelids and head drooped {{so much that it}} was impossible to catch even a glimpse of his eyes. His lower jaw hung down. There was no contraction of any <b>facial</b> <b>muscle,</b> and Dr. Ogle is almost certain that the hair did not stand on end, for he observed it narrowly, as it had been dyed for the sake of concealment.|$|E

The cause is unknown (idiopathic). Objective : To determine the physiotherapy management in improving the strength of the <b>facial</b> <b>muscles</b> and improve functional ability of <b>facial</b> <b>muscles</b> on the condition of the bell’s palsy using infra red modalities, electrical stimulation (faradic) and mirrors exercise. Methods : The act modality therapy using infra red is given for 15 minutes, electrical stimulation (faradic) given for ± 20 minutes with contractions 20 - 30 times, and mirrors exercise to perform functional movements of the <b>facial</b> <b>muscles</b> at a dose 10 times repetition. Results : After physiotherapy for 6 times, the result is a decrease in numbness (thick), increase strength and functional ability of <b>facial</b> <b>muscles</b> and increasing the ability of functional activities such as eating, drinking and rinsing. Conclusion : Infra red, electrical stimulation (faradic) and mirrors exercise able to reduce numbness (thick), increase strength and functional ability of <b>facial</b> <b>muscles</b> and is able to improve functional activities such as eating, drinking and rinsing.

50|$|Central facial paralysis/palsy {{often has}} similar {{characteristics}} with stroke patients. Because of uncrossed areas from the ipsilateral and the supranuclear areas, {{movements in the}} frontalis and upper orbicularis oculi are often spared. Facial movement can be present on the affected side when the person expresses emotion. Damage to {{the central nervous system}} motor pathway from the cerebral cortex to the facial nuclei is found in the pons. This leads to facial weakness that spares various muscles in the face {{depending on the type of}} paralysis. The discrepancy of the weakness between the upper and lower <b>facial</b> <b>muscles</b> are due to the bilateral corticonuclear innervation from the upper <b>facial</b> <b>muscles</b> and contralateral corticonuclear innervation to the lower <b>facial</b> <b>muscles.</b>|$|R
