5|$|Sashadhar Mukherjee, an {{assistant}} sound-engineer at the studio, had a brotherly bond with Devika Rani because {{both of them}} were Bengalis and spoke that language with each other.

25|$|Now it {{happened}} that on a cold and wintry day, as Lillinonah was out walking in the woods high above the swift rapids of the Housatonic, she came upon a handsome young white man wandering aimlessly through the forest, stumbling occasionally and falling to his knees before rising once more and continuing on.

To his understandable shock, she then kills him, declaring that the love <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> that the ring detected was not for him, but for the Clann she belonged to, that accepted her when no one else would.|$|E
