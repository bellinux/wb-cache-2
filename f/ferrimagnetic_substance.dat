40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{properties of the}} intermetallic phases R 3 Co 8 Sn 4 (R = Y, Gd) are presented. The two compounds order ferro- (Y) and ferri-magnetically (Gd) with transition temperatures of 61. 5 and 102. 5 K, respectively. In the paramagnetic region, the Y-compound follows the Curie-Weiss law with mu = 0. 98 mu(B) /Co and theta(P) = 62. 0 K while a more complex behaviour, typical of a <b>ferrimagnetic</b> <b>substance,</b> is observed for Gd,Co,Sn,. The experimental data, analysed {{in the framework of}} the molecular field theory, allow to obtain the exchange parameter for the Go-Co (J(Co-Co) = 83 k(B)) and of the Gd-Co (J(Gd-Co) = 11 k(B)) interactions...|$|E
40|$|The heat {{capacities}} of Li 0. 5 Fe 2. 5 O 4 and Li 0. 5 Al 2. 5 O 4 were measured by adiabatic calorimetry from 5 to 545 K and no transitions or thermal anomalies were found. The lowtemperature heat capacity of Li 0. 5 Fe 2. 5 O 4 shows the T 3 / 2 dependence expected for a <b>ferrimagnetic</b> <b>substance.</b> Lattice and spin-wave {{contributions to the}} heat capacity were calculated and compared with Pollack's values. The heat {{capacities of}} both compounds above 300 K are in good agreement with values obtained by Kopp's rule based on the component oxides. At 298. 15 K, the heat capacity at constant pressure Cp, the entropy So, and the function [{Go(T) - Ho(0) }/T] are 34. 43, 29. 20, and - 11. 811 calth K- 1 mol- 1 for Li 0. 5 Fe 2. 5 O 4; 26. 79, 17. 899, and - 6. 246 calth K- 1 mol for Li 0. 5 Al 2. 5 O 4. For the latter compound at 298. 15 K [Delta]Hfo = -(541 +/- 2) kcalth mol- 1 and [Delta]Gfo = -(535 +/- 2) kcalth mol- 1...|$|E
50|$|The {{materials}} {{in which the}} exchange interaction is much stronger than the competing dipole-dipole interaction are frequently called magnetic materials. For instance, in iron (Fe) the exchange force is about 1000 times stronger than the dipole interaction. Therefore, below the Curie temperature {{virtually all of the}} dipoles in a ferromagnetic material will be aligned. In addition to ferromagnetism, the exchange interaction is also responsible for the other types of spontaneous ordering of atomic magnetic moments occurring in magnetic solids, antiferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism.There are different exchange interaction mechanisms which create the magnetism in different ferromagnetic, <b>ferrimagnetic,</b> and antiferromagnetic <b>substances.</b> These mechanisms include direct exchange, RKKY exchange, double exchange, and superexchange.|$|R
