5|$|In the Shatapatha Brahmana, Manu {{performed}} a fire-sacrifice {{in order to}} have children. Idā emerged from the sacrifice. She was claimed by Mitra-Varuna, but she lived with Manu and together they initiated the race of Manu. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>text,</b> Idā is the goddess of the sacrificial meal. She is described as the Mānavi (daughter of Manu) and Ghṛtapadī (with the ghee-dripping foot) and she is represented by a cow, also known as Idā during a sacrifice. Pururavas is mentioned as the son of Ilā in the text.|$|E

The Linga Purana gives a brief description of Ardhanarishvara as making varada and abhaya mudras and holding a trishula and a lotus. The Vishnudharmottara Purana prescribes a four-armed form, with right hands holding a rosary and trishula, while the left ones bear a mirror and a lotus. The form is called Gaurishvara <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>text.</b>|$|E

The special case of the acoustoelastic theory for a compressible isotropic hyperelastic material, like polycrystalline steel, is reproduced and shown <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>text</b> from the non-linear elasticity theory as presented by Ogden.|$|E

25|$|Dews play {{a crucial}} role in the cosmogonic drama of the Bundahishn, a Zoroastrian view of {{creation}} completed in the 12th century. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>text,</b> the evil spirit Ahriman (the middle Persian equivalent of Avestan Angra Mainyu) creates his hordes of dews to counter the creation of Ormuzd (Avestan Ahura Mazda). This notion is already alluded to in the Vendidad (see Younger Avestan texts above), but only properly developed in the Bundahishn. In particular, Ahriman is seen to create six dews that in Zoroastrian tradition are the antitheses of the Amahraspands (Avestan Amesha Spentas).|$|E

25|$|The speech called Die Christenheit oder Europa {{was written}} in 1799, but was first {{published}} in 1826.

He got the inspiration for this text from Schleiermacher’s Über die Religion (1799). The work was also a response to the French Enlightenment and Revolution, both of which Novalis saw as catastrophic and irreligious. It anticipated, then, the growing German and Romantic theme of anti-Enlightenment visions of European spirituality and order.|$|E
