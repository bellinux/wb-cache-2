40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation on a four-stage centrifugal blower, having the aim of obtaining an accurate description of the flow field behind the impellers in several operative conditions and for the different geometric configurations. The blower has been tested in the four stage vaneless diffuser configuration. The unsteady flow field behind the impellers and in the diffusers has been measured by means of a hot-wire anemometer. Several detailed measurement sets have been performed using both single and crossed hot-wire probes, to obtain the velocity vectors and turbulence trends, just behind the <b>blower</b> <b>impellers</b> and in several radial positions of the vaneless diffusers. These measurements have been done at different flow rate conditions. The results obtained allowed a detailed flow field analysis in the multistage centrifugal blower, in relation to the geometric configuration and to the differing operating conditions...|$|R
30|$|Because {{response}} surface methodology can establish the unknown function between design variables and response variables, {{it has been}} widely applied to optimization. Choon-Man Jang and Ka-Ram Choi [2] carried out the optimization of the <b>blower</b> <b>impeller</b> by using the {{response surface}} method (RSM). Heng Jiang et al. [3] carried out a dynamic and static multi-objective optimization of a vertical machining center based on response surface method. Quadratic polynomials are employed to construct response surface (RS) model, which reflects the relationship between design inputs and structural response outputs, according to the response outputs of these samples obtained by analyzing the dynamic and static characteristics of the machining centre at these samples with the software ANSYS. In the field of vehicle optimization, RSM also get a widely application [4 – 6]. Chun-Lin Wang et al. [7] carried out a variable curvature blade of fire pump based on experimental design theory and response surface approximation. Dong-Sheng Jia et al. [8] established the mass function of impeller of water valve-controlled hydrodynamic coupling with RSM and optimized the impeller key structural parameters. Response surface method is applied {{in the field of}} robust optimization design [9, 10]. Reliability analysis has an improvement based on response surface method [11, 12].|$|R

Centrifugal {{machines}} {{are widely used}} in all most all industries for variety of purposes ranging from manufacture of household items to the turbo pumps of space vehicles. This wide spectrum of use of these machines {{has given rise to}} spatial restriction in their working environment, which causes non-uniform flow at the entry of their rotors. This non-uniformity is called inlet distortion and it usually degrades the performance of these machines. This paper presents the results of an investigation carried out to experimentally determine the performance of a radial blower with three types of inlet ducts. Attempts has been made to use different methods for the evaluation of the inlet distortion caused by different shapes and the orientation of the inlet ducts and observe its degenerating effects on the performance of the radial blower. Performance in terms of stable operating ranges of the <b>blower</b> and <b>impeller,</b> and pressure rise coefficients for the <b>blower,</b> <b>impeller</b> and the volute, have been evaluated. It has been found that both the stable operating range and the pressure rise coefficient depend on inlet distortion. It has been found out that both these performance parameters decrease with the increase in the inlet distortion. Further it has been found out that both the shape and orientation cause different magnitudes of inlet distortion and hence decrease the performance parameters of the blower to different magnitudes.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The {{work done}} for this {{dissertation}} {{is based on}} actual thermo–hydraulic design work done during 2002 to 2006 {{on one of the}} subsystems of the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR). The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor is a proved revolutionary small, compact and safe nuclear power plant. It operates on a direct closed Brayton cycle. One of the unique features of this concept is its ability to easily regulate the power output depending on the electricity demand. The PBMR fuel comprises particles of enriched uranium dioxide coated with silicon carbide and pyrolytic carbon. The particles are encased in graphite to form a fuel sphere or pebble {{about the size of a}} billiard ball. The core of the reactor contains approximately 360 000 of these fuel spheres for a 400 MW design reactor. The fuel spheres are continuously circulated through the reactor core via a closed loop helium conveying system, referred to as the Fuel Handling and Storage System (FHSS). The system is also responsible for discharging spent–fuel spheres to the spent–fuel storage area and recharging the reactor with fresh fuel spheres. The focus of this dissertation is the thermo–hydraulic design of the FHSS system, with specific focus on the FHSS helium circulator, referred to as the FHSS blower. The FHSS blower is a single–stage centrifugal machine, submerged in an enclosed pressure boundary, which forms part of the closed–loop helium pressure boundary. The aim of the dissertation is to simulate all the operating parameters of the system to determine the volumetric flow rate and pressure rise the <b>impeller</b> of the <b>blower</b> has to deliver. Due to the complexity of the simulation model and lack of experimental data a Sensitivity and Monte Carlo study was also done. The output of the study is sufficient thermo–hydraulic data to design all the major components of the FHSS system. For components such as the piping and pressure boundary this includes (i) temperature, (ii) pressure and (iii) heat transfer through the material at all the operating conditions. For the blower it includes; (i) blower mass flow rate, (ii) pressure ratio, (iii) inlet pressure and (iv) inlet temperature at all the operating conditions. Master...|$|R
