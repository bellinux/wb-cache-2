Physicians' perceptions of the drug on a number of attributes, e. g. effectiveness, range of ailments for which appropriate, frequency of prescriptions, are used to estimate the parameters of a model originally proposed by Lilien, Rao and Kalish (Lilien, G. L., A. G. Rao, S. Kalish. 1981. Bayesian estimation and control of detailing effort in a repeat purchase diffusion environment. Management Sci. 27 (May) 493 [...] 506.). This model conceptualizes the drug adoption process as a repeat purchase diffusion model; sales are expressed as a function of a drug's own and competitive marketing efforts and of word of mouth. The model is first validated in this paper via predictive testing on 19 drugs prescribed by three types of physicians. The forecasting methodology is illustrated using physicians' perceptions on these drugs.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the 1987 changes in the Canadian Patent Act on the pricing of <b>ethical</b> <b>drugs.</b> From 1969 to 1987 Canada opted to control pharmaceutical prices by using the compulsory licensing provisions of the Act to promote competition between branded drugs and their generic equivalents. In 1987, however, the Act was amended to guarantee patent holders an extended period (7 - 10 years) of protection. This reduced brand-generic competition by retarding generic entry and suggests that, ceteris paribus, after 1987 pharmaceutical prices increased relative to pre- 1987 prices. This hypothesis is examined for the period 1981 - 1994 using a sample of 82 drugs from the British Columbia Pharmacare Programme. The major conclusions are: despite evidence of significant first mover advantages which resulted in higher brand prices, competition from generics succeeded in reducing overall market prices prior to 1987; but, after 1987, the efficacy of generic competition was reduced and both brand and market prices increased. ...|$|R
40|$|The complex ways {{in which}} {{technical}} challenges of trial design provoke, and are provoked by, ethical, commercial and political factors are considered. It is suggested {{that the quality of}} the drug trial evidence base greatly depends on the how ethical, commercial and political priorities are set, and not merely on standardized techniques of data processing. Whether such standardized techniques are raising or lowering the quality of safety information about new drugs, and the protection of patients on clinical trials is explored. It is revealed that these international standards, intended to define valid evidence-based medicine for drug trials, are not themselves robustly evidence-based. It is argued that the internationalized regulatory standards developed to frame the evidence base for drug safety and efficacy are frequently inconsistent with furthering patients¿ well-being and public health. Rather, those standards reflect a regulatory culture of neoliberal corporate bias, and have been powerfully shaped by the commercial and political interests of the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory institutions.

The research context is the global - 50 countries worldwide - launch of 58 new ethical drugs across 29 therapeutic areas. We show that the fastest launch occurs when the launch price is moderately high and the highest launch price occurs at a launch window of 85 months. We find that the health regulator acts strategically in that {{the extent to which it}} delays {{the launch of}} a new drug increases with the price of the new drug. We also find that regulation overall increases the launch window, except for patent protection. Surprisingly, regulation does not directly impact launch price.

40|$|When several {{products}} are marketed {{by the same}} sales force, it frequently becomes impossible or impractical for salesmen to promote all items in the product line extensively in each and every time period. Management 2 ̆ 7 s problem is to decide how the available selling effort should be allocated across products and over time. The opportunity costs associated with using limited selling resources to promote certain products but not others must be evaluated. This paper describes a decision calculus-type modeling system for dealing with this question. The problem is analyzed by a two-step procedure. First, a response function is defined which relates selling effort to sales and profit results in a manner which represents some behavioral phenomena considered to be important. An interactive conversational program elicits judgmental data from managers which are used to parameterize the response model. A separate response function is specified for each product in the firm 2 ̆ 7 s line by this method.

40|$|Phase I {{clinical}} trial based on toxicity probability intervals {{is a new}} class of dose-finding designs characterized by integrating the concept of intervals, instead of point estimates, in detection of the maximum tolerated dose. The {{purpose of this article is}} to explore and compare the performance of three novel designs including the two-parameter logistic regression model with categorized posterior probability design (LRcat), the modified toxicity probability interval design (mTPI) and the Bayesian optimal interval design (BOIN). A thorough numeric study with eight potential scenarios was conducted to examine critical operating characteristics. Robustness of the novel designs to the change in the target interval width and mis-specified priors was investigated in a sensitivity analysis following the simulation study. In addition, we also retrospectively analyzed a recent cancer phase I {{clinical trial}} to explore the performance of these designs in real-world application The results of our analysis showed that interval-based designs perform comparably to a traditional CRM design using posterior mean to define MTD in most scenarios. LRcat is more flexible than CRM and demonstrates robustness to the varying target toxicity interval. BOIN is safer than other designs and allocates less patients to overly-toxic levels. mTPI is more likely to allocate patients to suboptimal doses when the true MTD resides at the lowest/highest doses and performs poorly when the target interval is asymmetric.

40|$|Background: Though drug {{promotion}} regulations exist worldwide, {{low quality}} of journal drug advertising {{is a global}} issue. Medical journals are regarded as a leading source of information for new drugs. They may also modulate prescribing behavior of physicians without their knowledge. A comparative analysis of advertisements from different countries may provide insights regarding {{strengths and weaknesses of}} different regulating systems. Aims: Prescription drug advertisements from the Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology, and Leprology (IJDVL) and Journal of American Academy of Dermatology (JAAD) were compared to check their compliance with criteria of World Health Organization (WHO) and International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA). Methods: All the prescription drug advertisements of at least one page length appearing in all the issues of IJDVL and JAAD from January 2012 till December 2012 were included in this study. The contents of both advertisements were compared for compliance regarding different criteria of ethical codes for drug advertising of WHO and IFPMA. Statistical analysis was done using Fisher′s exact test. Results: Compared to IJDVL, more advertisements in JAAD complied with WHO and IFPMA codes. On the whole, advertisements in IJDVL had significantly less information regarding the approved usage, dosage, abbreviated prescribing information (API), summary of scientific information, safety information regarding the drug, and references to the scientific literature to support various claims. However, JAAD had more advertisements with multiple claims than IJDVL, and many advertisements interspersed between scientific articles while IJDVL had none. Conclusion: The complex issue of <b>ethical</b> <b>drug</b> advertising in dermatology journals requires constant review and discussion.

40|$|Drug {{advertising}} as {{communication between}} the pharmaceutical industry and the physician: Advertisements for psychotropic drugs in the Dutch medical journal, Nederlands Tijdschrift voor Geneeskunde, 1900 - 1940   In this article we explore {{the historical development of}} drug advertisements for psychotropic drugs in the leading Dutch medical journal from 1900 to 1940. The advertisements for hypnotics and sedatives, in the Nederlands Tijdschrift voor Geneeskunde (Dutch medical journal) reflected the changes in the vocabulary and image promoted by the pharmaceutical companies. In the first two decades, the advertisements were sober and to the point, and included the trademark, company name, molecular formula and therapeutic properties of the medication. The emphasis was on creating a scientific image of reliable symptom control for the therapeutic drug. In doing so, the <b>ethical</b> <b>drug</b> companies tried (successfully) to distinguish themselves from the producers of patent medicines. Once scientific credibility was established, the form and content of the advertisements changed significantly. In the late 1920 s and 1930 s drug companies embraced modern advertising techniques, developing a figurative language to address the changing beliefs and practices of Dutch physicians. Instead of promoting therapeutic drugs as safe and scientific, the emphasis was on their effectiveness in comparison to similar drugs. In the process, scientific information was reduced to an indispensable standardized minimum, whereby therapeutic drugs were advertised according to the latest pharmacological taxonomy rather than molecular formulas. The image-making of ‘ethical marketing’ began during the interwar years when marketers applied modern advertising techniques and infotainment strategies. The scanty black and white informational bulletins transitioned into colourful advertisements. The pharmaceutical companies employed the same medical language as used by physicians, so that one word or image in an advertisement would suffice for the physician to recognize a drug and its therapeutic properties. These developments show the changing relationship between the modern ethical pharmaceutical industry and Dutch doctors during the interwar years – from rapprochement towards concerted action. </p...|$|E

Drawing upon a qualitative field research, it studies pharmaceutical companies, since those companies face a very specific challenge: consumers do not have discretion over their choices, <b>ethical</b> <b>drugs</b> must be prescribed by physicians to be bought and used by final consumers. Technical information flow is rich, and must be redundant and early delivered at multiple points. Thus, apart from the regular material channel where products and order information flow, those companies build a specialized information channel, developed to communicate to those who need it to create demand.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to empirically analyse the {{responses}} by general practitioners to promotional activities for <b>ethical</b> <b>drugs</b> by pharmaceutical companies. Promotion can be beneficial as a means of providing information, but it can also be harmful in the sense that it lowers price sensitivity of doctors and it merely is a means of maintaining market share, even when cheaper, therapeutically equivalent drugs are available. A model is estimated that includes interactions of promotion expenditures and prices and that explicitly exploits the panel structure of the data, allowing for drug specific effects and dynamic adjustments, or habit persistence. The data used are aggregate monthly GP prescriptions per drug together with monthly outlays on drug promotion for the period 1994 - 1999 for 11 therapeutic markets, covering more than half of the total prescription drug market in the Netherlands. Identification of price effects is aided by the introduction of the Pharmaceutical Prices Act, which established that Dutch drugs prices became a weighted average of the prices in surrounding countries after June 1996. We conclude that GP drug price sensitivity is small, but adversely affected by promotion. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{rapidly growing}} medical expense going with aging {{population}} in Japan requires {{the use of}} generic products derived from off-patent active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) formulations to reduce the financial burden for the national health insurance system, {{while at the same time}} avoiding undermining the quality of medical care. This article provides an overview of the regulatory approaches available to confirm the quality of generic products and gain their greater acceptance by patients. Among several approaches taken by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW), designing systems to supply higher quality products, and providing scientific information to patients and healthcare professionals are key elements to promote the voluntary choice of the generic product. The revision of bioequivalence guidelines and the enhancement of good manufacturing practice (GMP) requirements facilitate the rational development and manufacturing control of generic formulations. A program termed Quality Reevaluation of <b>Ethical</b> <b>Drugs</b> was carried out from 1997 to 2012 using dissolution tests to avoid any significant bioINequivalence between originators and generic oral formulations. The evaluation of product quality and the assessment of the literature information by the Expert Committee on Quality of Generic Drug Products have provided a unique science-based and patient-focused approach for the distribution of reliable generic products.

The <b>ethical</b> <b>drugs</b> sector in the OECD health care systems is increasingly targeted as the major culprit in the rising cost. Using multiple regression analysis, and the maximum likelihood estimation method, the data of each country (taken from OECD Health Data, 1997) were first tested for functional form optimality with the Box-Cox power family transformations model. Drug expenditure elasticities, at data means, were computed using each country's optimal regression model estimates.

The effect of a one-period lagged real per-capita drug expenditure (capturing inertia or habit persistence) on current period real per-capita prescription expenditure is statistically significant in most countries. Pharmaceutical demands are inelastic, and tend to behave like a necessity, as expected.

When applied to a priori defined (e. g., socioeconomic) segments, our proposed methodology provides a new way to display marketing data parsimoniously via dimension reduction through a factor-analytic specification. In post hoc studies, we simultaneously derive market segments from the data and represent the structure of market information within each of the unobserved, derived groups/segments. We summarize all relevant information concerning derived market segments via a series of maps that prove conducive to the quick and accurate dissemination of customer and competitor market information. The associations between the variables are captured in a reduced space, where each variable is represented by a vector that emanates from the origin and terminates on a hypersphere of unit (the vector length is arbitrary) radius (e. g., a unit circle in a two-dimensional space). The angles between the variable vectors capture the correlation structure in the reduced space. The method is very general and can be utilized to identify latent structures {{in a wide range of}} marketing applications. We present an actual commercial marketing application involving the (normalized) prescription shares (of specialists) of <b>ethical</b> <b>drugs</b> to demonstrate the effectiveness of representing market information in this manner and to reveal the advantage of the proposed methodology over a more general finite mixture-based method. The proposed methodology derives three segments that tend to group specialists with respect to the stage of adoption of innovation in this therapeutic category. The specialists in the first group appear to be laggards because they prescribe more of the older class of brands. However, they also have a higher-than-average preference for a newer and somewhat cheaper brand. This suggests that some of the specialists belonging to this segment may be price sensitive, while others may exhibit a slower adoption cycle, replacing the older class with the newer brands, and thus, skip one stage in the cycle of innovation. The specialists in the second segment are heavy users of the newer class of brands but are not particularly fast to adopt the latest brands. Finally, the last segment clearly consists of innovators. Traditionally, pharmaceutical marketers have viewed specialists in one of two extremes—all specialists are the same (i. e., the market has only one segment) or all specialists are very different (i. e., the market consists of 10, 000 + segments of one physician each). Not surprisingly, this analysis suggests a more moderate perspective: specialists adopt new products at different rates.
