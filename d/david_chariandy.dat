40|$|This article {{examines}} the representation of Canadian multiculturalism in Lawrence Hill’s Any Known Blood (1997) and <b>David</b> <b>Chariandy’s</b> Soucouyant (2007). I argue that these novels {{can be regarded as}} revisions of Canada’s official policy towards minorities, because they both creatively rewrite silenced parts of national history, and attempt to remap the connections between Canada and the world beyond the national frontiers. Hill’s and Chariandy’s revision of the past and redrawing of the present are made particularly clear in their novels through the representation of Canadian space, more specifically in their distancing from the image of urban centres as areas of cosmopolitanism. This idea of setting the narrative in conventionally Canadian (rural) topographies is also a way of locating their Black characters in a geographical environment traditionally seen as White, which thus allows the writers to question the very elements constitutive of Canadian identity and, by extension, of the Canadian nation.

5000|$|It {{was during}} this time that he wrote his first and most notable novel, No Pain Like This Body, {{published}} in 1972. Described by <b>David</b> <b>Chariandy</b> and [...] "an unusually strong first novel", it is the vivid {{story of a young}} boy growing up in a small Caribbean rice-growing community. The book focuses on the day-to-day struggles of a single family through illness, storm, and violence during the August rainy season. The writing is raw and often naïve yet manages to create a visceral experience.|$|E

40|$|Histories of racialization in Canada {{are closely}} tied to the {{development}} of eugenics and racial hygiene movements, but also to broader concerns, expressed throughout Western modernity, regarding the “health” of nation states and their subjects. This dissertation analyses books by Velma Demerson, Hiromi Goto, <b>David</b> <b>Chariandy,</b> Rita Wong, Roy Miki and Larissa Lai to argue that Asian Canadian literature reveals, in heightened critical terms, how the politics of racial difference has consistently been articulated through the language of bodily health, life, and feeling. Building upon existing debates in Asian Canadian literary studies, and drawing from interdisciplinary scholarship in biopolitics and affect theory, the dissertation reveals how the discourse of “life” and “health” has served as the rationale for practices such as internment, sterilization, and unauthorized medical experiments, but also how the literature and theory of the feeling body, including its memories, symptoms, and conceptual limits, can promote awareness both of historical injustice and of the new terms informing the cultural politics of race today...|$|E
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} ways in which contemporary black Canadian novels rewrite national space by integrating into it what might be called past and present black spatialities. Regardless of its official policy of multiculturalism, Canada appears unable to reflect the diversity of its population, one of the most multi-ethnic in the world, which results in the social and spatial exclusion of minorities—whose presence is perpetually construed as ‘recent’—from the dominant national narratives. Starting from Henri Lefebvre’s assertion that “[a] social transformation, to be truly revolutionary in character, must manifest a creative capacity in its effects on daily life, on language and on space” (54), and from the conceptualization of fictional literature as both a product and a producer of geographical creativities, this work considers the literary respatializations of black Canada in five recent novels, At the Full and Change of the Moon (1999) and What We All Long For (2005) by Dionne Brand, Any Known Blood (1997) and The Book of Negroes (2007) by Lawrence Hill, and Soucouyant (2007) by <b>David</b> <b>Chariandy.</b> I specifically examine four topographies through which these writers relate ‘blackness’ to ‘Canadianness,’ namely, the ocean, the city, the rural suburb, and the home space. More specifically, this dissertation illuminates how these literary representations of Canadian space locate this nation within the paradigmatic locations of black history but also show how the country’s social and geographical landscape is marked by the black history {{that took place in the}} country itself. Through a multidisciplinary approach which looks at theorizations of space emanating from literary, geographical, and sociological fields of study, I examine how these writers shift the terms of Canadian identity by disrupting the founding narratives of the nation which rely on the country’s wild landscapes and construct Canada as a white-only space. Finally, this dissertation engages with racialized bodies whose interconnectedness with both physical and imaginary spaces allow for a multiplicity of creative spatializations to emerge...|$|E
