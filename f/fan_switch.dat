5000|$|It must be {{held that}} Minneapolis-Honeywell has been so using its patent as to tend to create a {{monopoly}} in an unpatented device. Minneapolis-Honeywell has been licensing others and has offered to license Mercoid to manufacture, use and sell a single device which embodies within itself two elements of the Freeman patent, namely, the two thermostats which are placed in the furnace hood, one being the <b>fan</b> <b>switch</b> and the other being the limit switch. This device, embodying these two elements, is [...] [...] [...] an unpatented device. The Freeman patent is not a patent on either the <b>fan</b> <b>switch</b> or the limit switch or both of them. It is a patent on a system of furnace control, which requires three thermostats for its operation. It happens that two of those thermostats are a <b>fan</b> <b>switch</b> and a limit switch. The court is {{of the opinion that}} it follows, from what has been said, that both complaints, that of Mercoid and that of Minneapolis-Honeywell, must be dismissed for want of equity.|$|E

50|$|Edward E. Freeman {{invented a}} system to control a hot air furnace that uses three {{thermostatic}} switches for its operation. A room thermostat starts the stoker. Another thermostat (or limit switch) opens the stoker circuit when {{the air in the}} furnace reaches a predetermined temperature, irrespective {{of the fact that the}} room thermostat may still call for heat. This second thermostat operates to prevent unsafe conditions due to overheating. The third thermostat is also in the furnace. It controls a fan which forces hot air from the furnace to the rooms. It does not permit the fan to start until the air in the furnace reaches a specified degree of heat. But, at that point, it starts the fan, which continues to run, even though the limit switch has stopped the stoker, so long as the furnace is hot and the room thermostat calls for heat. The patent was on the combination patent of three thermostatic switches, not on any of the switches alone and not on the combination of the <b>fan</b> <b>switch</b> and the limit switch.|$|E
40|$|Presented at the 2002 Fuel Cell Seminar, Palm Springs, CA, November 2002 The Schatz Energy Research Center (SERC) has designed, built, and {{operated}} a PEM fuel cell power system that supplies back-up {{power to a}} remote radio-telephone repeater. The repeater, located within Redwood National Park in northwestern California, {{is part of the}} Yurok Indian Reservation???s telecommunications system. A photovoltaic (PV) system with batteries provides primary power for the repeater. When solar insolation is insufficient to maintain battery state-ofcharge, the 100 -Watt fuel cell system starts automatically and provides clean, quiet, reliable power. The system began unattended operation in November 1999. The original fuel cell stack logged 3239 hours of run time. In January 2001, SERC engineers refurbished the original fuel cell stack, incorporating improved membrane-electrode assemblies and gas diffusion media. The original resin-impregnated graphite was replaced with pyrosealed components and a temperaturecontrolled <b>fan</b> <b>switch</b> was added to protect the stack from sudden temperature increases while minimizing parasitic loads. The system ran continuously though October 2001, accumulating 3836 hours of run time and completing 283 start-stop cycles. The system and the original stack are described in detail in two earlier papers [1, 2]. This paper will focus on the performance of the second stack used in the system.
