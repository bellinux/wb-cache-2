In Murad v Al Saraj the Murad sisters {{entered a}} joint venture (creating a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relation,</b> like for trustees) with Mr Al Saraj to buy a hotel. He deceitfully told them he was investing all his own money, when in fact he set off a debt from the seller and took an undisclosed commission. When sued {{to give up the}} profits he made, he submitted that the sisters would have entered the transaction even if they had known what he had done. Arden LJ rejected this argument, affirming that upon such a wrong, it was not open for the fiduciary to argue what might, hypothetically, have happened. A reduction in liability could only come from a determination of the value of skill and effort contributed. This is less generously quantified for dishonest fiduciaries, but generous allowances are typically given, as in Boardman v Phipps for fiduciaries who all along act honestly. Trustees who are found to commit wrongs may also have a defence under the Trustee Act 1925 sections 61–62. This gives courts discretion to relieve liability for people who acted [...] "honestly and reasonably, and ought fairly to be excused". There may also be exclusion clauses in the trust deed, up to the point of removing liability for fraud and open conflicts of interest. Chiefly exclusion clauses will erase liability for breaches of the duty of care, although for professional trustees the ability to do this is constrained by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. If agreements for money management take place through contracts, a professional trustee probably cannot exclude liability for breach of contract under section 3, because given that he would be better placed to take out insurance liability exclusion will probably not be reasonable under section 11. Lastly, the Limitation Act 1980 sections 21–22 prevents claims for innocent or negligent trust breach being pursued six years after the right of action accrues, again with the exception for fraud or property converted by trustees for their own use, where there is no limit.|$|E

Other class 2A relationships include doctor and patient, parent and child, solicitor and client, or any <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relation</b> (but not wife and husband). Where the relation does not fall into one of these, it stands with [...] "class 2B" [...] cases. Here, a claimant may first prove that there was in fact a strong relation of trust and confidence. If that is done, and there is a disadvantageous transaction, it will be presumed to result from undue influence. It will then be up to the recipient of the property to rebut the presumption. This takes on greatest significance in cases involving banks typically lending money to a husband for his business, and securing a mortgage over the husband and wife's jointly owned home. Significant problems arose, particularly after the early 1990s housing, stock market and currency crashes, where the husband's business failed, the bank attempted to repossess the house, and the wife claimed she never understood the implications of the mortgage or was pressured into it.

40|$|Being {{regarded}} as a professional and having one's occupational group {{regarded as}} a profession are often deemed desirable. It is not immediately apparent {{why this is so}} 'Professional' often contrasts simply with 'amateur', and as a label conveys not honor but the recognition that the one so labelled is paid for doing what others do for free. But there is a distinct, honorific sense in which the professional contrasts not with the amateur but with the person who simply has a job rather than a life-long calling. It is in this honorific sense that physicians, attorneys and members of the clergy serve as paradigm professionals. Aspiring professionals in disciplines other than the paradigm ones regard themselves as more nearly like these paradigms than is usually recognized, and this is their claim to recognition as professionals. The paper explores several possible points of similarity by developing an account of the ideal for professionals which has been held in Western society at least since the time of the Hippocratic Oath, which best captures its spirit. As the Oath makes clear, professionals have <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relations</b> with their patients or clients, and provide services of a personal nature.

In one of the earliest cases, Carter v Boehm, Mr Carter bought an insurance policy for any losses to a naval fort of the British East India Company in Sumatra, but failed to tell his insurer, Boehm, that the fort was only built to resist attacks from locals, and the French were likely to invade. Lord Mansfield held the policy was invalid. Since insurance is a contract based on speculation and the special facts [...] "lie most commonly in the knowledge of the insured only", good faith precluded Mr Carter [...] "concealing what he privately knows". The same policy was extended for sale of shares in a company. So in Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co the promoter and director-to-be of a guano mining business failed to disclose he had paid for the mining rights on the island of Sombrero half as much as he subsequently was valuing the company at.

Though we cherish freedom and equality, there are human {{relations}} we commonly take to be morally permissible {{despite the fact that}} they essentially involve an inequality specifically of freedom, i. e., parental and <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relations.</b> In this article, I argue that the morality of these relations is best understood through a very old and dangerous concept, the concept of status. Despite their historic and continuing abuses, status relations are alive and well today, I argue, because some of them are necessary. We must therefore carefully specify the conditions in which such status relations may morally obtain, as well as the duties of virtue and duties of right to which all parties are subject when it does (including a duty of care) to clearly articulate the ways in which these putatively moral status relations that essentially involve an asymmetry of autonomy (status relations) can go well or badly even within the context of the Kantian tradition from which our current legal and social practices arose. To this end, I offer Kant's own concept of status as a promising one because in Kant's theory, status is a nexus of virtue and right that is reducible to neither property nor contract but akin to each in familiar ways. Once status is admitted as an alternative to property and contract, status may be extended beyond Kant's domestic paradigm, most perspicuously to institutional ethics. In this article, I sketch a status-based theory of stakeholding that locates environmental impact, institutional oppression, and other significant features of our moral landscape within a Kantian framework of duties rich enough to more accurately characterize the complexities of stakeholding than current tradition has allowed...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1902 {{decision}} of Percival v. Wright 1, Canadian common law has provided that directors generally have no fiduciary duties to shareholders. Shareholders {{have continued to}} assert that directors have such duties, however. Moreover, shareholders have been attracted by the allure of the rigorously restitutionary remedies imposed on fiduciaries. Cases in which share holders have made claims of fiduciary duty against directors since the law reforms of the 1960 s and 1970 s are examined. The law reformers expected that the courts would develop the law of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relations</b> within the corporation. Moreover, the nature of securities law reforms confronted the courts with the previously noted gulf between the statutory fiduciary obligations imposed on directors and insiders of widely-held corporations {{and the lack of}} such obligations in private companies. This review of judicial decisions begins with an examination of the compulsory acquisition cases which preceded the statutory take-over bid reforms. These cases arise from facts which would constitute take-over bids under the statutory reforms of the 1960 s. In these cases, we see a very limited attempt by the judiciary to impose fiduciary obligations of good faith and candour in favour of minority shareholders. The courts' sense of commercial morality seems to have been stirred in these cases, a morality engendered by the arbitrary expropriation permitted by the statutory compulsory acquisition provisions. An examination of latter day cases involving claims of fiduciary duty show that the decisions are sprinkled with references to commercial morality. Despite this moral impetus, the courts seem unwilling to venture beyond the perceived constraints of the corporations statutes. This unwillingness, coupled with the courts' inability to articulate a uniform rationale for imposing fiduciary duties on directors in favour of shareholders contribute to the unsatisfactory state of the law.

Recent scandals involving fraud, bribery, and corruption of public pension officials and other third parties have drawn the public eye toward the management of retirement assets. Individual and entity custodians, including pension boards of trustees, are charged with making investment and other decisions relating to pension funds. Unlike private pensions, there is no federal oversight of asset managers or others in control of retirement funds. Yet these funds hold more than three trillion dollars in assets. Until now, the guardians of these monies have operated almost invisibly {{in the background of}} the public pension crisis. This Article advances the retirement reform debate by looking more closely at the fiduciary relationship that exists between trustees and beneficiaries involving public sector employee pension funds.

From that viewpoint, it evaluates what the <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relation</b> means, or should mean, in the changing legal environment of public retirement systems. The main objective is to raise issues involving fiduciary law and public pensions that have been undervalued or ignored.

It contemplates the equitable dimension of the public pension problem, analyzes circumstances where fiduciary violations may arise, and suggests possible outcomes.

40|$|In this master's thesis "Strategies of {{food and}} health experts' in {{interpretation}} and facilitation of risks" the author {{tried to find out}} which are the risk interpretation and facilitation strategies of Estonian food and health experts in the post-modern risk and knowledge-based society. The scope of the study is food risks. The aim of the author was {{to find out what the}} experts base their risk ratings on, how willing they are to take into account any other knowledge and experience different from their expert systems, and how is the communicative role of experts seen in interpretation and mediation of risks. The centre of the theoretical part of the study is a professor of sociology Urich Beck and his theory of the risk society. The author finds that the characteristic features of risk society have a considerable influence on the communication of the society and put forward new demands for scientific information creation. Today we have a demand for complex risk communication. The lack of it leads to communicative tensions between communication flows {{of food and}} health risks directed by various interest groups. The experts are mediators of knowledge in the risk and knowledge-based society and that is why the study is focused on the experts' strategy. The method of the study is 9 semi-structured expert interviews with various specialists of the Estonian food and health sphere. The empirical results of the study showed that the experts base their risk ratings on a complex of various factors. The influencing factors of risk rating are the age and the level of education of the expert, working experience and environment, <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relations</b> and authorities, and health conditions of the person or his/her immediate family. The expert's attitude towards risks and the manners and types of risk handling eventually form in concurrence with all of those factors. By the attitude towards the risks, the experts who participated in the study could be placed on the following scale: high vs. low uncertainty in constructing the risks, meaning if and how the risks of the expert's rating are controllable. Low uncertainty means that the limits of safe/dangerous are clear for the expert and the expert does not have many doubts or hesitations. High uncertainty means that the limits of safe/dangerous are not that clear to the expert, the limits are not so well controllable and raise doubts and hesitations for the expert. The results show that the experts are willing to consider different knowledge from their own expert system if the risk defining strategy used before does not work anymore and/or the expert has doubts and hesitations about it. The reason for hesitations of that kind could be a health condition or other health disorders of the expert or his/her family member, also the expert's personal wider and more systematic interest of dietic matters. The expert is not willing to consider different knowledge and experience regarding his/her education, practice and competence if the hesitations do not rise regarding the strategy used by the expert so far. According to the experts, the surrounding media of food and health risks is shaped by very many factors and channels. The experts pointed out media, internet and books, scientific research and articles, packages and verbally spreading information such as rumours and myths as the information source and information mediation medium. In addition to that, the information medium is influenced by Estonia, the European Union and the industry. The experts who participated in the study interpret the public information medium as a very eclectic one where it is very hard for the consumer to orientate without having prior knowledge about food and health risks. In addition to this overall eclecticism, the experts find that there are two controversial communication flows in the communicative medium. In contrary to the main communication flow emanating from the verifiability of risks which is representing the industry, Estonia and the EU, there is a so called alternative communication flow emanating from uncontrollable risks which represents the experts who stand for "sufferers' voice", the consumers aware of risks, and new business trends such as eco-production and eco-marketing. Due to the eclectic nature of the information medium and controversial information flows, there are communicative tensions of food and health risks also in the Estonian society which need addressing sooner or later. The experts' vision of their role in interpreting and mediating risks depends on the expert's communicative activity. The experts who participated in the study have a different level of activity in the communication of food and health risks. The experts who are active or moderately active in the communication see their role as a food and health risk mediators. Different views on the risks among the experts raise various problematic topics. There are two controversial groups in the other experts’ communication rating that do not accept each other: experts with high communicative activity who believe that the risks are clearly determinable and controllable vs. experts with high communicative activity who believe that the risks are indeterminable and uncontrollable. Therefore, the difference is essentially in the view on risks. The presence and absence of control contrast with the lack of and/or controllability of risks. All in all, in the light of this master's thesis it can be clearly noted that there are communicative tensions in the sphere of food and health risks among the two contrasting communication flows. One of those flows denies the food and health risks and emanates from the fact that the risks are defined and controllable. In contrary, the other flow emanates from the fact that there are risks and that the risks are indefinable and thus uncontrollable. The communicative tensions arising from risk communication need solutions sooner or later...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} fiduciary agreements, which, {{as a form}} of contract, that is {{the means}} of securing obligation and legal claims, are regulated by provisions of specific laws and codifications in some of the European Union countries. Even the Montenegrin legislator enacted a special law governing these legal matters, however in the Serbian law fiduciary agreements fall into the category of innominate contracts. Fiducia originates in the Roman Law and constitutes the first common form of the pledge law. The Latin term fiducia means 'trust', since these legal matters were, first of all, based on the trust between contractual parties. This paper addresses the institution of 'trust' as it is the Anglo-Saxon counterpart of the fiduciary agreement. Etymologically, 'trust' has the same meaning as the term fiducia - trust. Due to their advantages, fiduciary agreements are not even uncommon in the domestic legal practice, while there are certain, as we have already announced, theoretical, but also practical concerns arguing admissibility of this legal matter. These arguments mainly come down to the thesis (mentioned above) that entering into the fiduciary agreement results in violation of the ban on performance of contract lex commissoria in the pledge law. Nevertheless, I provided explanation that differences between contracts of pledge and fiduciary agreements clearly point to the conclusion that fiduciary agreements may not be treated as a pledge, hence they are admissible, that is, they are concluded on the principle of contractual freedom as an imperative norm of the Law on Obligations. <b>Fiduciary</b> agreements (in <b>relation</b> to the realistic means of security) offer to the creditor a higher level of security, reduce the period of payment of his claims, also providing practical benefits for the debtor himself. The paper presents the reasons supporting the view that it would be advantageous for the Serbian legislator, in the process of harmonization of the legislation in the field of Civil Law with the European Union law, to regulate the institute of fiduciary agreements under the special law, integrate it into the Law on Obligations or make it a part of the future Civil Code of the Republic of Serbia...|$|R
