5000|$|A {{water bar}} or {{interceptor}} dyke is a road construction feature {{that is used}} to prevent erosion on sloping roads, cleared paths through woodland (for utility companies such as electricity pylons), or other accessways by reducing flow length.

40|$|The {{initiation}} {{and evolution}} of a kilometre-scale, sand braid-bar was monitored during a 28 -month survey period from 1993 to 1996 {{in one of the}} world's largest braided rivers, the Jamuna River, Bangladesh. Repeated bathymetric surveys through two monsoon flood seasons, combined with bar-top surveys during exposure of the bar at low flow, provide the most detailed chronology of braid-bar growth yet compiled for a large sand-bed river. During rising and peak flow of the 1994 monsoon flood, a 1. 5 -km-long, 0. 5 -km-wide, 12 -m-high, symmetrical mid-channel bar was deposited in the centre of a major channel downstream of a zone of flow convergence and significant bank erosion. Initial deposition and growth of the bar core were probably caused by amalgamation of dunes that are present in the Jamuna channels at all flow stages. Bar-top aggradation continued through downstream migration of an `accretionary dune front', a 3 -m-high, angle-of-repose slipface that was composed of amalgamated, 0. 5 - to 1 -m-high dunes. At waning and low flow, the mid-channel bar widened by up to 1 km through the lateral accretion of dunes onto the margins of the initial bar core. A low-velocity zone in the sheltered wake region of the bar-tail led to the accumulation of substantial volumes of silts and clays. During the rising and peak flows of the next monsoon <b>flood,</b> the mid-channel <b>bar</b> extended its bar-tail by up to 1. 5 km, as one of the anabranches became dominant, and flow was deflected across the bar-tail. Accretion at the bar-tail generated a lobate, transverse bar-front with a 10 -m-high, angle-of-repose avalanche face. Emergence of several smaller bars along this depositional front produced an overall reach morphology that more closely resembled an alternate bar rather than several mid-channel bars. The conversion of a mid-channel bar to an alternate bar is contrary to many previous descriptions of the braiding process...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Large wood (LW) {{pieces are}} {{recognized}} as an important habitat component for salmon freshwater habitat. As such, they are often used in stream habitat restoration practices {{despite a lack of}} knowledge about their impacts on spatial and temporal hydraulic characteristics relevant to fish habitat. In this thesis we present results on the impacts of LW on reach scale stream hydraulics. We use hydraulic models to identifying patterns and magnitudes of change in aspects of the flow field that are relevant to juvenile Coho Salmon after an addition of LW. The Nays 2 DH model was used because of its capacity to model unsteady flows around LW structures in-stream. Flow conditions after LW addition were modeled in three alluvial plane bed gravel reaches of Mill Creek in the Oregon Coast Range, a long term salmon life cycle study site. Study streams are small, with a bankfull (Q[subscript bf]) discharge between 2. 2 and 8. 7 m³/s and bankfull widths varying from 5. 5 to 10. 6 m. Survivable habitat was characterized for the flow field in terms of a) velocity (v) less than critical swim speed of juvenile Coho Salmon (v[subscript crit] = 0. 5 m/s); b) and bed refuge estimated based on the likelihood of the movement of the reach median bed particle size (D₅₀). Spatial and temporal increases in wetted area were also determined. After the addition of LW, the area of acceptable habitat increased 17 - 26 % in terms of velocity, 31 - 39 % in terms of substrate stability, and 24 - 35 % in terms of wetted area at Q[subscript bf]. Similar magnitudes of increase were observed over an entire storm hydrograph in each site. Patterns of change in the flow field showed deep pools of slower water forming upstream of LW jams which agreed with initial field observations of geomorphic change. Newly inundated <b>flood</b> plains and <b>bars</b> represented large portions of the additional habitat after the addition of LW. These areas had low velocity and shear stress values indicating that their contributions to additional habitat will be resilient to fluctuation even if acceptable habitat metrics were to be adjusted...|$|R
40|$|The lower Saugus Formation {{along the}} {{southern}} foothills of the Santa Susana Mountains and the San Gabriel Mountains, northern San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles County, California is a sequence of Plio-Pleistocene deposits that records the progradation into the ocean of a large delta and some associated small streams. Study of these rocks reveals 12 lithosomes. The lithosomes include marine deposits of lithosomes A (slightly fossiliferous pebble conglomerate), B (fossiliferous sandstsone), C (slightly fossiliferous sandstone), D (fossiliferous muddy sandstone), and E (algal mudstone), and fluvial deposits of lithosomes F (unfossiliferous cobble conglomerate), G (laminated conglomeratic sandstone), H (structureless sandstone), I (muddy fine sandstone), J (red sandy mudstone), K (varicolored non-sandy mudstone), and L (white sandy limestone). Rocks in the middle {{part of the study}} area were deposited in a river-dominated, braided delta system at first and later in a meandering fluvial system. The marine portion of the delta system included deposits of the lower delta plain, small distributary channels, interdistributary bay, and delta front. Storms sometimes influenced the bay. The meandering river carried mainly sand- and mud-sized particles and formed mostly braided <b>bar,</b> point <b>bar,</b> <b>flood</b> basin, and backswamp deposits. One of the major channels of this river, the ancient Santa Clara River, flowed {{in the area of the}} San Fernando Reservoir during depostion of the lower part of the lower Saugus Formation and then possibly migrated to the east as the delta prograded to the south and west. Rocks in the eastern and western parts of the study area were deposited in two separate braided fluvial systems. A wide range of grain sizes in these braided streams was available. Gravelly braided bars are the main deposits in the two areas. Complete fining upward sedimentation cycles are common. Marine deposits are absent [...] The San Gabriel Mountains were the major source area for the clasts in the rocks. The Simi Hills and other hills to the north provided a part of the clasts. The ancient Santa Claria River and other braided streams carried the clasts into the basin. Near the end of the Pliocene at the beginning of deposition of the lower Saugus Formation in this area, the San Gabriel Mountains stood as a highland to the east and the Simi Hills existed as an offshore island to the west. The area between Limekiln Canyon and the San Fernando Reservoir was a shallow, deltaic bay environment. As time passed into the early Pleistocene, the delta prograded southward and westward and the bay was filled with meandering river deposits.

O mÃtodo para o reconhecimento dessas formas topogrÃficas consiste no mapeamento de seÃÃes transversais em trechos distintos do canal localizados no alto, mÃdio e baixo curso. O mapeamento Ã realizado com um conjunto de nÃvel Ãtico e mira. Foram mapeados quatro canais fluviais, sendo dois canais em Ãreas com cotas altimÃtricas inferiores a 400 metros e, outros dois canais com cotas superiores a 700 metros. Os canais apresentam planÃcies de inundaÃÃo com extensÃes variadas. Foram encontradas formas topogrÃficas como diques, barras em pontal, bacias de inundaÃÃo, soleiras e depressÃes. Os dados coletados mostram que hÃ forte incisÃo do canal nos trechos correspondentes ao alto curso dos canais, e, que nos trechos de baixo curso as planÃcies de inundaÃÃo sÃo bem desenvolvidas. O meandramento de canais Ã uma caracterÃstica do Planalto de Cascavel. A formaÃÃo de barras em pontal estÃ associada diretamente a erosÃo marginal, enquanto que os diques sÃo resultantes da decantaÃÃo de sedimentos. As sequÃncias de soleiras-depressÃes ocorrem pela diminuiÃÃo da velocidade do fluxo em alguns trechos, e, em outros, pela presenÃa de detritos lenhosos. Nos trechos rochosos onde hÃ afloramento rochoso foi observada a formaÃÃo de marmitasRivers {{are important}} agents {{working in the}} sculpturing of relief, through its high transport capacity of sediments originary from slopes and marginal erosion. The modeling occurs through the processes of erosion and deposition of sediments, which depend on variables such as lithological composition, slope, and flooding. The processes that originate topographic forms are widely described {{in the literature of}} alluvial-bed rivers, however {{little is known about the}} occurrence of these forms in mixed bed channels (alluvial-rock) and bedrock channel. In this context, this research aims to describe the topographic forms of the valleys on the Cascavel Plateau. The method for the recognition of these forms is the topographic mapping of cross sections in different parts of the channel located at the top, middle and lower course. The mapping is performed with a set level and optical sights. Were mapped four fluvial channels, two channels in areas with altimetric elevations below 400 meters, and two other channels with elevations above 700 meters. The channels have floodplains with varying lengths. Topographic forms were found as dikes, point <b>bars,</b> <b>flood</b> inundation basins, pools and riffles. The data collected show strong channel incision in the sections corresponding to the upper parts of the channels, and that in the course stretches of low flood plains are well developed. Channel meandering is a characteristic feature of the Cascavel Plateau. The formation of point bars is directly associated with the channel marginal erosion, whereas the dikes are the result of sediment settling. The pool-riffle sequences occur by the reduction of the flow velocity in some places, and, in others, by the presence of woody debris. In some parts of the river where are rock outcrop was observed the formation of pot-hole...|$|R
