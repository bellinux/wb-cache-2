5|$|Varaha often {{features}} in the Dashavatara stele - where the ten major avatars of Vishnu are portrayed - sometimes surrounding Vishnu. In the Vaikuntha Vishnu (four headed Vishnu) images, the boar is shown as the left head. Varaha's shakti (energy or consort) is the Matrika (mother goddess) Varahi, who is depicted with a boar <b>head</b> <b>like</b> the god.|$|E
5|$|A man on new year's day, {{dressing}} {{himself in}} blankets and other trappings, with a factitious <b>head</b> <b>like</b> a horse, and a party attending him, knocking for admittance, this obtained, he runs {{about the room}} with an uncommon frightful noise, which the company quit in real or pretended fright; they soon recover, and by reciting a verse of some cowydd, or, in default, paying a small gratuity, they gain admission.|$|E
50|$|Buné is {{depicted}} as a three-headed dragon, being his <b>heads</b> <b>like</b> those of a dog, a griffin, and a man (although according to some grimoires he has two <b>heads</b> <b>like</b> a dragon and the third like a man).|$|R

5|$|Baleen whales {{have two}} {{flippers}} on the front, near the <b>head.</b> <b>Like</b> all mammals, baleen whales breathe air and must surface periodically to do so. Their nostrils, or blowholes, are {{situated at the}} top of the cranium. Baleen whales have two blowholes, as opposed to toothed whales which have one. These paired blowholes are longitudinal slits that converge anteriorly and widen posteriorly, which causes a V-shaped blow. They are surrounded by a fleshy ridge that keeps water away while the whale breathes. The septum that separates the blowholes has two plugs attached to it, making the blowholes water-tight while the whale dives.|$|E
5|$|Foreign Minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned, shaving his <b>head</b> <b>like</b> a Buddhist monk in protest. Mẫu {{had decided}} to leave the country for a {{religious}} pilgrimage to India and the diplomatic and press corps assembled at the airport to see him off. He never arrived, as the Ngô family had him arrested. General Đính softened the punishment at the behest of a fellow officer, and put the former diplomat under house arrest instead of placing him in jail.|$|E
5|$|Confronting Joyce {{about the}} story, Lois {{questions}} her intentions, with Joyce revealing {{that the two}} attended high school together, where she was known as Joyce Chevapravatdumrong. She also reveals that Lois humiliated {{her in front of}} the entire school, by placing a hotdog in her mouth and pulling down her pants while blindfolded (revealing her pink underwear), and has sought revenge ever since. At church the next day, Lois and her family enter, and are immediately demanded to leave by the preacher. Becoming extremely depressed, Lois is eventually coaxed by Brian to face her mistake by showing it to the church. The porno causes the church to reaccept her and admit the Griffin family back into their congregation due to a positive opinion of the film, much to Joyce's anger. Stewie in the meantime develops suspicions of having been conceived through the creation of the porno, heightened when he sees that one of the actors has a football-shaped <b>head</b> <b>like</b> his.|$|E

5|$|Tom Savini {{agreed to}} return to make-up duties for The Final Chapter because he felt he {{should be the one}} to bring Jason full circle in terms of his look from child to man. Savini used his design from the {{original}} Friday the 13th, with the same practice of application as before, but molded from Ted White's face. Since Jason is not the actual killer in A New Beginning, it was not necessary to do any major designing for Jason's look. Only a head mask to cover the top and back of the <b>head,</b> <b>like</b> the one Brooker wore while wearing the hockey mask, was needed for the film. Make-up artist Louis Lazzara, who cites A New Beginning as almost a direct sequel to The Final Chapter, did base his head-mask on Tom Savini's design for The Final Chapter.|$|E
5|$|Punk {{continued}} to show messianic traits, frequently giving sermons including during the annual Royal Rumble match {{as well as}} during an Elimination Chamber match at both of the eponymous pay-per-views. In the Chamber match, he was eliminated by Rey Mysterio, whom he had feuding with leading into the PPV. Tensions escalated as Mysterio prevented him from winning a Money in the Bank qualifying match, causing Punk to interrupt Mysterio's celebration of his daughter's ninth birthday. Mysterio challenged Punk to a Street Fight at WrestleMania XXVI but lost to Gallows. Punk added the stipulation that if Rey lost, he would join the Society. At WrestleMania, Punk lost to Mysterio sparking a rematch at Extreme Rules where Punk would have to shave his <b>head,</b> <b>like</b> his disciples, if he lost. Punk won this match after interference from a fourth member of the Society who kept his face covered. At Over The Limit, a third and final match was booked with both stipulations reactivated. In the match Punk lost and was subsequently shaved bald.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} reference in England to {{the legend of}} the pig-faced woman is the fable of Tannakin Skinker, a 17th-century variation on the traditional loathly lady story, in particular on The Wife of Bath's Tale and The Marriage of Sir Gawain. The Skinker story is generally considered the basis for later English stories of pig-faced women. Between 4 and 11 December 1639, five ballads about Skinker were published in London, all of which are now lost. (A 1640 ballad, A Monstrous Shape: or, A Shapelesse Monster, a Description of a female creature born in Holland compleat in every part, save only a <b>head</b> <b>like</b> a swine, who hath travelled in many parts and is now to be seen in London, shees loving, courteous and effeminate and nere as yet could find a loving mate, is preserved in Samuel Pepys's extensive collection of ballads.) The earliest surviving record of the Tannakin Skinker story is that given in A Certaine Relation of the Hog-faced Gentlewoman called Mistris Tannakin Skinker, a 1640 chapbook.|$|E

5|$|The {{next step}} is to apply hair. The hair can either be done in one of two ways; wigging, rooting or microrooting. when rooting hair is added 1-4 hair strands per plug. When microrooting, hair is added strand by strand. This can take up to 30 or more hours per head. Once the hair is finished, the {{original}} vinyl body is weighted with a soft stuffed body filled with pellets/fine glass beads/fiberfill.The weight corresponds with its age to achieve a real effect. Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance. Reborns heads are often weighted, so that owners have to support the <b>head</b> <b>like</b> one would a real newborn. Purchasers can have magnets attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a pacifier or hair bows. Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat, or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common. Reborns can come with an umbilical cord, baby fat, heat packs to make the reborn warm to the touch, or voice boxes that mimic infant sounds. For preemie dolls, they may come in incubators with a breathing apparatus attached to their nose.|$|E

He used to smoke 20 cigarettes a day prior to undergoing double heart bypass surgery in 1991 while he was the coach of Barcelona. Cruyff was forced to immediately give up smoking, and he made an anti-smoking advertisement for the Catalan Department of Health. In the TV spot, Cruyff is dressed like a manager in a long trench coat combined with collared shirt and tie. He juggled a cigarette pack 16 times – using feet, thighs, chest, shoulder, and <b>head</b> <b>like</b> holding up a ball – before volleying it away. Throughout the commercial he speaks in Catalan about the dangers of smoking.|$|E
