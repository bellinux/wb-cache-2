40|$|Selective {{association}} of germ-free (GF) rats with dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) <b>desulfating</b> bacteria {{allowed us to}} assess the exact impact of intestinal bacterial desulfation on the excretion and enterohepatic circulation of orally administered DHEAS. Germ-free rats selectively associated with the DHEAS-desulfating strain Peptococcus niger H 4 (H 4 rats) excreted 50 % of the total label recovered within 17 h vs 21 h in GF rats and 13 h 23 min in conventional (CV) rats. Germ-free rats excreted 30 % of the total label recovered via their urine. However, {{association of}} GF rats with the <b>desulfating</b> microorganism increased urinary excretion to 46 %, comparable to the 45. 5 % found in CV rats. Fractionation of fecal label yielded 70 % sulfoconjugated DHEAS and 2 % unconjugated dehydroepiandrosterone in GF rats vs 5 and 77 % in CV rats, and 55 and 14 % in H 4 rats, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the intestinal bacterial desulfation of DHEAS stimulated the enterohepatic circulation of DHEAS. This in turn increased the urinary excretion of label resulting in an accelerated elimination of labeled DHEAS from the body. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Arylsulfatase A (AS-A) is a {{lysosomal}} enzyme, which catalyzes the desulfation {{of certain}} sulfogalactolipids, including sulfogalactosylglycerolipid (SGG), a molecule implicated in cell adhesion. In this report, immunocytochemistry revealed the selective presence of AS-A in the corpus luteum of mouse ovaries. Immunoblotting indicated that mouse corpus luteum AS-A had a molecular mass of 66 kDa, similar to AS-A of other tissues. Corpus luteum AS-A was active, capable of <b>desulfating</b> the artificial substrate, p-nitrocatechol sulfate, at the optimum pH of five. To understand further {{the role of}} AS-A in female reproduction, levels of AS-A were determined during corpus luteum development in pseudopregnant mice and during luteolysis after cessation of pseudopregnancy. Immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting and desulfation activity showed that AS-A expression was evident {{at the onset of}} pseudopregnancy in the newly formed corpora lutea, and its level increased steadily during gland development. The increase in the expression and activity of AS-A continued throughout luteolysis after the decrease in serum progesterone levels. We also observed the selective presence of SGG on the luteal cell surface in developed corpora lutea, as shown by immunofluorescence of mouse ovary sections as well as high-performance thin-layer chromatography of lipids isolated from mouse and pig corpora lutea. The identity of the “SGG” band on the thin layer silica plate was further validated by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Significantly, SGG disappeared in regressing corpora lutea. Therefore, lysosomal AS-A may be involved in cell-surface remodeling during luteolysis by <b>desulfating</b> SGG after its endocytosis and targeting to the lysosome...|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{examples}} of biochemical adaptations to the mustard oil bomb. One occurs in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. This worldwide crop pest feeds exclusively on members of the Brassicaceae and has developed a defense against the glucosinolate-myrosinase complex. The moth has an enzyme, a sulfatase, that it uses to <b>desulfate</b> the glucosinolate, meaning the myrosinase cannot locate and remove the β-glucose to form the mustard oils. Plant hosts contain a variety of glucosinolates; while {{all of them have}} the β-glucose and sulfated oxime. The diamondback moth, however, can apparently <b>desulfate</b> a wide range of natural glucosinolates - perhaps all.|$|R
40|$|The {{strictly}} anaerobic intestinal Peptococcus niger H 4 synthesizes {{three different}} steroidsulfatase enzymes: a constitutive arylsulfatase and two inducible alkylsteroidsulfatases. The arylsulfatase <b>desulfates</b> estrogen- 3 -sulfates and phenylsulfates. The two alkylsteroidsulfatases <b>desulfate,</b> respectively, 3 alpha-sulfates and 3 beta-sulfates of delta 5, 5 alpha, and 5 beta androstanes, pregnanes, and bile acids. Cholesterol- 3 beta-sulfate was not desulfated by the alkylsteroidsulfatases nor were steroids or bile acids that were sulfated in positions {{other than the}} 3 position. The alkylsteroidsulfatases were induced by their substrates; bile acid sulfates, however, were poor inducers of the 3 beta-sulfatase and did not induce the 3 alpha-sulfatase activity. In intact bacterial cells, taurine and sulfite suppressed the induction of the alkylsteroidsulfatases and inhibited {{the activity of the}} arylsulfatase and alkylsteroidsulfatases. In cell homogenates, the arylsulfatase and alkylsteroidsulfatases activities were inhibited by sulfite and sulfate but not by taurine. Our results support the hypothesis that the main function of the steroidsulfatases in P. niger H 4 is to provide the bacteria with sulfur for dissimilatory purposes. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|A characteristic, {{specialised}} insect fauna {{is found}} on glucosinolate-containing plants, including familiar butterflies such as large white, small white, and orange tip, but also certain aphids, moths, saw flies, flea beetles, etc. For instance, the {{large white butterfly}} oviposits its eggs on these glucosinolate-containing plants because they help the larvae survive. The biochemical basis of these specialisations are being unraveled. The whites and orange tips all possess the so-called nitrile specifier protein, which diverts glucosinolate hydrolysis toward nitriles rather than reactive isothiocyanates. In contrast, the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) possesses a completely different protein, glucosinolate sulfatase, which <b>desulfates</b> glucosinolates, thereby making them unfit for degradation to toxic products by myrosinase.|$|R
40|$|There is now {{substantial}} evidence that sulfated biomolecules (i. e., carbohydrates, proteins, and steroids) contribute to many disease states, 1 including chronic inflammation, 2 HIV- 1 infection, 3, 4 and hormone-depend-ent breast tumor growth. 5, 6 The sulfate ester {{is often a}} key determinant of bioactivity, directing significant attention to the corresponding enzymes, the sulfotrans-ferases, as {{a new class of}} therapeutic targets. Estrogen sulfotransferase (EST) catalyzes the transfer of a sulfuryl group from 3 ′-phosphoadenosine 5 ′-phos-phosulfate (PAPS) to estrogen (3, 17 -â-estradiol) and estrogen-like compounds in the cytosol, solubilizing them to maintain hormone homeostasis (Figure 1).

40|$|Hepatic {{sulfation}} {{is thought}} to promote fecal excretion of lithocholate in humans by impairing the enterohepatic recirculation of the compound. Sulfatases produced by the gut flora may, at least in part, counteract this process. To investigate this interaction, female germfree rats, which are known to excrete considerable amounts of sulfated bile salts, were selectively associated with a bile salt <b>desulfating</b> flora. In these rats nearly all cecal, colonic, and fecal bile salt sulfate esters were hydrolyzed, resulting in a decrease of total fecal bile salt excretion of greater than 25 % compared with gnotobiotic rats without a bile salt <b>desulfating</b> flora. Desulfation of allochenodeoxycholate, the major sulfated bile salt in germfree rats, led to an enhanced recirculation and 12 alpha-hydroxylation of the compound in the liver, resulting in an increased fecal output of allocholate. Microbial desulfation of intraperitoneally injected [24 - 14 C]taurolithocholate- 3 -sulfate caused a fivefold decrease of the fecal plus urinary excretion rate of the isotope to approximately that found for unsulfated [24 - 14 C]taurolithocholate. Coassociation of the gnotobiotic rats with a microflora that normalized the small intestinal transit time and cecal size led to a rise of total fecal bile salt excretion of greater than 30 % and a twofold accelerated excretion of both sulfated and unsulfated injected [24 - 14 C]taurolithocholate. We conclude that in rats the gut flora rapidly desulfates intestinal bile salt sulfates, enhancing the enterohepatic recirculation and subsequent hydroxylation of the desulfated bile salts. In addition, these data illustrate {{the importance of having}} a well-defined microflora to normalize intestinal transit time and cecal size of gnotobiotic animals when performing kinetic studies of enterohepatic circulating compounds. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} shows the {{application}} of viable bacterial cells for removing undesired deposits {{from the surface of}} a stone polychrome bas-relief, exhibited at the Interdisciplinary Gallery of Sicily Palazzo Abatellis (Palermo). Diagnostic studies carried out during the restoration were aimed at characterizing the technique of execution and understanding the degradation processes. The results of the XRF and FTIR investigations showed that on large areas of the artifact’s surface, stratified deposits with a significant presence of sulfates were present. For bioremoval of the deposits, viable bacterial cells belonging to the species Desulfovibrio vulgaris, were utilized in gelled solution form, evaluating and comparing the effectiveness of this cleaning with that of the <b>desulfating</b> agents usually employed. The results demonstrate that by using the colonised substrate as a nutritional source in their natural metabolic processes, this bacterial species can be used to obtain high efficiency and selectivity of action, representing a valid alternative to the use of traditional chemical agents...|$|E
5000|$|The {{important}} role Sulf1 and Sulf2 in skeletal development {{is not surprising}} given its regulation of bone-related growth factors. For example, QSulf1 reduces specific HS 6-O sulfation which releases Noggin, an inhibitor of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), allowing cells to become BMP-4 responsive. Therefore, this directly links Sulf1 to the complex developmental patterning mediated by BMPs. Wnt signaling also is regulated by QSulf1. Investigators found lowered Wnt activation through the Frizzled receptor {{in the absence of}} QSulf1 expression in non-expressing embryonic cells. 6-O sulfate HS binds with highly affinity to Wnt, abrogating receptor activation. [...] QSulf1 is required to <b>desulfate</b> 6-O chains, not entirely releasing Wnt but lowering the affinity with HS. This low affinity complex then binds and activates the Frizzled receptor.|$|R
40|$|Lactosylceramide sulfate and galactosylceramide sulfate {{were found}} to {{increase}} markedly in human renal cell carcinoma (adenocarcinoma) as compared to uninvolved tissue. Activities of two sulfotransferases toward galactosylceramide and lactosylceramide as substrates were significantly elevated in the carcinoma compared to the uninvolved tissue resulting in enhanced synthesis of the two sulfatides in the carcinoma. The elevation of the two sulfotransferases was parallel in most tumors, suggesting that the same enzyme {{is responsible for the}} enhanced synthesis of two sulfatides. No consistent difference in the activity of arylsulfatase A, which <b>desulfates</b> the two sulfatides, was observed between the carcinoma and uninvolved tissue. Both the present and previous results show that the increased synthesis of the siilfutidc(s) due to elevated Sulfotransferase activity could be a biochemical characteristic common to adenocarcinomas derived from different tissues...|$|R
40|$|The {{degradation}} of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) involves {{a series of}} exolytic glycosidases and sulfatases that act sequentially on the nonreducing end of the polysaccharide chain. Enzymes have been cloned that catalyze all of the known linkages {{with the exception of}} the removal of the 2 -O-sulfate group from 2 -sulfoglucuronate, which is found in heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Here, we show using synthetic disaccharide substrates that arylsulfatase K is the glucuronate- 2 -sulfatase. Arylsulfatase K acts selectively on 2 -sulfoglucuronate and lacks activity against 2 -sulfoiduronate, whereas iduronate- 2 -sulfatase (IDS) <b>desulfates</b> synthetic disaccharides containing 2 -sulfoiduronate but not 2 -sulfoglucuronate. As arylsulfatase K has all of the properties expected of a lysosomal enzyme, we conclude that arylsulfatase K is the long sought lysosomal glucuronate- 2 -sulfatase, which we designate GDS...|$|R
40|$|Consolidation and {{protection}} {{are two of}} the principal kinds of treatments through which the decay of old statues, stone facades, plasters and mural paintings caused by both natural atmospheric agents and, above all in the last five decades, by atmospheric pollution, is faced. &# 13; The most traditional approach has been and is mainly based on the use of organic polymeric materials. &# 13; They offer the advantage of easy application procedures and the possibility to obtain, at short times, very satisfying results. Different is their behaviour at long times. Some drawbacks come out over time both under the esthetical point of view {{as well as to the}} durability, compatibility and efficacy. &# 13; Particularly critical is the situation when porous materials and soluble salts - gypsum above all - are simultaneously present. In such a situation inorganic treatments demonstrate to be much more appropriate. They assure durable and compatible results. &# 13; In the present paper two of the most efficient and appropriate inorganic methods are reviewed in detail: the barium hydroxide method, both as <b>desulfating</b> and consolidating agent, and the ammonium oxalate method as passivating agent, consolidant and as a treatment capable of improving the natural colour contrast of the stone, when it is lost due to decay processes...|$|E
40|$|A novel enzyme {{which may}} be {{important}} in mucin degradation has been discovered in the mucin-utilizing anaerobe Prevotella strain RS 2. This enzyme cleaves terminal 2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside 6 -sulfate (6 -SO 3 -GlcNAc) residues from sulfomucin and from the model substrate 4 -nitrophenyl 2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside 6 -sodium sulfate. The existence of this mucin-desulfating glycosidase (sulfoglycosidase) suggests an alternative mechanism by which this bacterium may desulfate sulfomucins, by glycosidic removal of a sulfated sugar from mucin oligosaccharide chains. Previously, mucin desulfation was thought to take place {{by the action of}} a specific <b>desulfating</b> enzyme, which then allowed glycosidases to remove desulfated sugar. Sulfate removal from sulfomucins is thought to be a rate-limiting step in mucin degradation by bacteria in the regions of the digestive tract with a significant bacterial flora. The sulfoglycosidase was induced by growth of the Prevotella strain on mucin and was purified 284 -fold from periplasmic extracts. Tryptic digestion and sequencing of peptides from the 100 -kDa protein enabled the sulfoglycosidase gene to be cloned and sequenced. Active recombinant enzyme was made in an Escherichia coli expression system. The sulfoglycosidase shows sequence similarity to hexosaminidases. The only other enzyme that has been shown to remove 6 -SO 3 -GlcNAc from glycoside substrates is the human lysosomal enzyme β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A, point mutations in which cause the inheritable, lysosomal storage disorder Tay-Sachs disease. The human enzyme removes GlcNAc from glycoside substrates also, in contrast to the Prevotella enzyme, which acts on a nonsulfated substrate at a rate that is only 1 % of the rate observed with a sulfated substrate...|$|E

TCA and TLCA were about two times more rapidly excreted by CV animals than by GF animals; {{the time required}} for 50 % excretion of total label injected (t 1 / 2) was 6. 6 days vs 14. 9 for TCA, and 4. 4 vs 8. 9 for TLCA. In GF and in CV animals, TCA- 3 -S and TLCA- 3 -S were excreted more rapidly than their nonsulfated analogues; the t 1 / 2 values of TCA- 3 -S and TCA were 2. 7 days vs 14. 9 in GF rats, and 3. 1 vs 6. 6 days in CV animals. The t 1 / 2 values of TLCA- 3 -S and TLCA were 2. 7 days vs 8. 9 in GF rats, and 1. 5 vs 4. 4 days in CV rats. In gnotobiotic rats associated with Clostridium strains S 1 + Cl- 8, fecal bile salts were nearly 100 % deconjugated and desulfated and the 50 % excretion times of TCA- 3 -S and TLCA- 3 -S approximated to those of TCA and TLCA in GF animals. T 1 / 2 of TCA- 3 -S in gnotobiotic S 1 + Cl- 8 animals was 12. 2 days vs 14. 9 for TCA in GF animals. In gnotobiotic S 1 + Cl- 8 animals the t 1 / 2 of TLCA and TLCA- 3 -S was 12. 5 and 11. 0 days, respectively. These results illustrate clearly the important effect the intestinal microflora has upon the metabolic half-life of bile salts. Moreover, they demonstrate that desulfation of bile salts by the intestinal microflora takes place in intestinal segments from where {{a certain degree of}} reabsorption is still possible, and thus point to the fact that microbial desulfation is an important variable in the overall elimination of bile salts. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Modification of the {{sulfation}} {{pattern of}} heparan sulfate (HS) during organ development {{is thought to}} regulate binding and signal transduction of several growth factors. The secreted sulfatases, Sulf 1 and Sulf 2, <b>desulfate</b> HS on 6 -O-positions extracellularly. We show that both sulfatases are expressed in overlapping patterns during embryonic skeletal development. Analysis of compound mutants of Sulf 1 and Sulf 2 derived from gene trap insertions and targeted null alleles revealed subtle but distinct skeletal malformations including reduced bone length, premature vertebrae ossification and fusions of sternebrae and tail vertebrae. Molecular analysis of endochondral ossification points to a function of Sulf 1 and Sulf 2 in delaying the differentiation of endochondral bones. Penetrance and severity of the phenotype increased with reduced numbers of functional alleles indicating redundant functions of both sulfatases. The mild skeletal phenotype of double mutants suggests a role for extracellular modification of 6 -O-sulfation in fine-tuning rather than regulating the development of skeletal structure...|$|R
40|$|The enzyme steroid sulfatase (STS) <b>desulfates</b> {{a variety}} of steroid {{compounds}} thereby altering their activity.

In this review, we first discuss evidence from human and animal model studies suggesting that STS deficiency might predispose to neurobehavioural abnormalities and certain psychiatric disorders.

5000|$|Sulf1 and 2 also display {{regulation}} over muscle development, angiogenesis, leukocyte {{rolling and}} wound healing. In adult mice, Sulf1 and Sulf2 have overlapping functions in regulating muscle regeneration. Functionally, Sulfs cooperatively <b>desulfate</b> HS 6-O present on activated satellite cells to suppress FGF2 signaling and therefore promote myogenic differentiation to regenerate muscle. [...] Because of this role, Sulfs {{may have a}} direct role in diseases such as muscular dystrophy. QSulf1 {{was used as a}} tool to either decrease sulfation of HS or increase sulfation by employing a dominant negative QSulf1 (DNQSulf1). Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) are highly influenced by degrees of HS sulfation. Overexpression of QSulf1 decreased adhesion, and increased proliferation and apoptosis of VSMC, while DNQSulf1 also decreased adhesion and increased proliferation, apoptosis, migration and chemotaxis of VSMC. [...] Displaying cell specific effects, both overexpression of Sulf1 and DNQSulf1 increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in VSMCs, a different response from cancer cell lines. [...] Essentially, these experiments display that a fine-tuned 6-O sulfation pattern is needed for proper function of VSMCs.|$|R
40|$|Although several {{abnormalities}} of lipid metabolism {{have been associated}} with abnormal cornification in humans, evidence that these lipids directly provoke abnormal scale is lacking. One recently described example of a lipid abnormality in ichthyosis is absence of the enzyme steroid sulfatase in recessive X-linked ichthyosis (RXLI). This enzyme normally <b>desulfates</b> cholesterol sulfate (CS) and sulfated steroid hormones, including dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). As a result of this enzyme deficiency, patients with RXLI accumulate CS in their blood and skin. To detemine whether sulfated sterols are the specific cause of increased scale, we applied CS, DHEAS, cholesterol, or vehicle alone to the backs of hairless mice. In animals treated with CS, but not with DHEAS or with vehicle, visible scale without erythema appeared after 1 week, peaked at 2 weeks, and then diminished. When the dose of CS was doubled, abnormal scale reappeared and then decreased again. CS-induced scale was reversible, clearing within 3 days of discontinuation of treatment. Because there was no acanthosis, dermal inflammation, abnormal transepidermal water loss, or increased labeling index, it appears that the 3 -fold increase in thickness of the stratum corneum in CS-treated animals is due to a direct effect on this layer...|$|R

40|$|Background: Human sulfatase 1 (hSulf- 1) is a heparin-degrading endosulfatase that <b>desulfates</b> cell surface heparan sulfate {{proteoglycans}} (HSPGs) in {{extracellular matrix}} and negatively modulates heparin-binding growth factor and cytokine signaling in cell proliferation. But hSulf- 1 function is more complicated, and its molecular mechanism {{has not been}} well known. Principal Findings: To further investigate the functions of hSulf- 1 gene in regulating the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) signaling, a series of vectors expressing hSulf- 1, hSulf- 1 small hairpin RNA (shRNA) and VEGFR- 2 shRNA were generated. hSulf- 1 re-expression could downregualte the VEGFR- 2 phosphorylation and inhibit cancer cell proliferation both in ovarian and hepatocellular cancer cell lines. Knockdown of hSulf- 1 expression by hSulf- 1 shRNA enhanced the recovery of high levels of phosphorylated VEGFR- 2, and knockdown of VEGFR- 2 expression by VEGFR- 2 shRNA inhibited the proliferation activity of cancer cells in vitro to some extent. In human cancer xenografts in nude mice, tumor growth was inhibited markedly after injections of adenovirus expressing hSulf- 1, with the tumor inhibition rates of 46. 19 % and 49. 56 % in ovarian and hepatocellular tumor models, respectively. hSulf- 1 expression significantly reduced tumor microvessel density.

Clostridium sp. strain S 1 desulfated the 3 alpha-monosulfates of chenodeoxycholic, deoxycholic, and cholic acid, but not their 7 alpha- or 12 alpha-monosulfates. Among the 3 -sulfates of the 5 alpha- and 5 beta-bile acids, only bile acid- 3 -sulfates with an equatorial sulfate group were desulfated. Hence, Clostridium sp. strain S 1 desulfated the 3 -sulfates of bile acids with a 3 alpha, 5 beta-, a 3 beta, 5 alpha- or a 3 beta, delta 5 -structure. In contrast, the bile acid- 3 -sulfates with a 3 beta, 5 beta- or a 3 alpha, 5 alpha-structure were not desulfated. In addition, Clostridium sp. strain S 1 did not hydrolyze the equatorial 3 -sulfate esters of C 19 and C 21 steroids and cholesterol or the phenolic 3 -sulfate esters of estrone and estradiol. 23 -Nordeoxycholic acid with a C- 23 carboxyl group was also not desulfated, in contrast to the 5 beta-bile acid 3 alpha-sulfates with a C- 24 or C- 26 carboxyl group. Therefore, the specificity of the sulfatase of Clostridium sp. strain S 1 is related to the location of the sulfate group on the bile acid molecule, the equatorial orientation of the sulfate group, and the structure of the C- 17 side chain, its carboxyl group, and chain length...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to elucidate the mechanisms of polylysine-mediated transfection into mammalian cells in vitro. In the first chapter, the role of membrane-associated proteoglycans in transfection was investigated by testing transfection efficiency under a number of assay conditions. Cells were treated with sodium chlorate in order to <b>desulfate</b> glycosaminoglycan chains. Chlorate treatment inhibited expression of luciferase, the intracellular uptake of DNA, and binding of DNA to the cell surface. Expression, uptake, and binding of DNA was also inhibited by exogenous glycosaminoglycans and by glycosaminoglycan lyases. Similarly, each of the transfection steps was severely inhibited in CHO cell mutants, incapable of synthesizing proteoglycans. Transfection by certain cationic liposomes was also inhibited in the mutant cell line. The possible implications of these results for gene therapy of diseases affecting hematopoietic cells is described. In the second chapter, polylysine-mediated gene delivery via the folate receptor was developed. Gene delivery by folate receptor-mediated endocytosis was approximately 18 times higher than by nonspecific endocytosis of polylysine-DNA {{in the presence of}} chloroquine. A number of controls confirmed that the folate receptor was critical in the gene delivery mechanism. When chloroquine was removed from the media, transfection efficiency dropped approximately 30 fold, suggesting that gene delivery occurred via a lysosomal pathway. In the final chapter, transfection by folate receptor-mediated endocytosis was characterized by 2 -photon laser scanning microscopy. KB cells were transfected with folate-polylysine-DNA complexes labeled with YOYO, a dimeric cyanine intercalator, and a single cell was examined over a two hour period.
