40|$|Abstract Background Efforts to ease {{administration}} and enhance acceptability {{of the oral}} anti-malarial artemether-lumefantrine (A-L) crushed tablet to infants and children triggered {{the development of a}} novel <b>dispersible</b> <b>tablet</b> of A-L. During early development of this new formulation, two studies were performed in healthy subjects, one to evaluate the palatability of three flavours of A-L, and a second one to compare the bioavailability of active principles between the <b>dispersible</b> <b>tablet</b> and the tablet (administered crushed and intact). Methods Study 1 was performed in 48 healthy schoolchildren in Tanzania. Within 1 day, all subjects tasted a strawberry-, orange- and cherry-flavoured oral A-L suspension for 10 seconds (without swallowing) in a randomized, single-blind, crossover fashion. The palatability of each formulation was rated using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Study 2 was an open, randomized crossover trial in 48 healthy adults given single doses of A-L (80 mg artemether + 480 mg lumefantrine) with food. The objectives were to compare the bioavailability of artemether, dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and lumefantrine between the <b>dispersible</b> <b>tablet</b> and the tablet administered crushed (primary objective) and intact (secondary objective). Results Study 1 showed no statistically significant difference in VAS scores between the three flavours but cherry had the highest score in several ratings (particularly for overall liking). Study 2 demonstrated that the dispersible and crushed tablets delivered bioequivalent artemether, DHA and lumefantrine systemic exposure (area under the curve [AUC]); mean ± SD AUC 0 -tlast were 208 ± 113 vs 195 ± 93 h. ng/ml for artemether, 206 ± 81 vs 199 ± 84 h. ng/ml for DHA and 262 ± 107 vs 291 ± 106 h. μg/ml for lumefantrine. Bioequivalence was also shown for peak plasma concentrations (C max) of DHA and lumefantrine.

In an exploratory approach, we compared a new pediatric formulation with the tablet formulation administered crushed in the treatment of African children with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Patients were randomized to 3 different dosing groups (weights of 5 to < 15 kg, 15 and < 25 kg, and 25 to < 35 kg). Treatment was administered twice daily over 3 days. Plasma concentrations of artemether and its active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin (DHA), were determined at 1 and 2 h after the first dose of dispersible (n = 91) and crushed (n = 93) tablets. A full pharmacokinetic profile of lumefantrine was reconstituted on the basis of 310 (<b>dispersible</b> <b>tablet)</b> and 315 (crushed tablet) plasma samples, collected at 6 different time points (1 sample per patient). Dispersible and crushed tablets showed similar artemether and DHA maximum concentrations in plasma (C(max)) for the different body weight groups, with overall means of 175 ± 168 and 190 ± 168 ng/ml, respectively, for artemether and 64. 7 ± 58. 1 and 63. 7 ± 65. 0 ng/ml, respectively, for DHA.

The Bacoside is poorly soluble, bitter in taste and {{responsible for the}} memory enhancement action. Memory enhancer is commonly prescribed for children or elder people. Objective: Poor solubility, patient compliance and bitterness were a major driving force to develop taste masked β-cyclodextrin complex and dispersible tablets. Materials and Methods: The inclusion complex of Bacopa monnieri and β-cyclodextrin was prepared in different molar ratios of Bacopa monnieri by Co-precipitation method. Phase solubility {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of β-cyclodextrin on aqueous solubility of Bacoside A. The characterization was determined by Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction study (XRD). Crospovidone and croscarmallose sodium were used as super disintigrant. The 32 full factorial design was adopted to investigate the influence of two superdisintegrants on the wetting time and disntegration time of the tablets. Conclusion: The result revels that molar ratio (1 : 4) of inclusion complex enhance 3 -fold solubility. Full factorial design was successfully employed for the optimization of <b>dispersible</b> <b>tablet</b> of B. monnieri. The short-term accelerated stability study confirmed that high stability of B. monnieri in inclusion complex...|$|E

40|$|GR 43175, a {{selective}} 5 -HT 1 -like agonist, was administered as oral <b>dispersible</b> <b>tablets</b> in an open, uncontrolled dose-ranging study to assess its efficacy {{as an agent}} for acute migraine. Nine patients, all with well established attacks, were assessed for changes in severity of headache and associated symptoms over 2 h. Drug absorption was compared during and between attacks in five patients. Doses of 140 mg and 280 mg resulted in complete relief of all symptoms within 2 h. Treatment was well tolerated in all patients. ...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{design of}} {{pediatric}} formulations is challenging. Solid dosage forms for {{children have to}} meet the needs of different ages, e. g. high number of dosing increments and strengths. A modular formulation strategy offering the possibility of rapid prototyping was applied. Different tablet compositions and the resulting tablet characteristics were investigated for <b>dispersible</b> <b>tablets</b> using customized analytical methods. METHODS: Fluid bed granules were blended with extragranular components, and compressed to tablets. Disintegration behavior was studied with a Texture Analyzer and a Tensiometer. RESULTS: Methods for determination of disintegration time and water uptake of tablets were developed with a Texture Analyzer, and a Tensiometer, respectively. Twenty-two different tablet formulations were prepared and analyzed with respect to disintegration time, hardness, friability, and viscosity. Multivariate data analysis revealed a high impact of type and amount of viscosity enhancer on the disintegration behavior of tablets. An optimized formulation was selected with a disintegration time of 24 s. CONCLUSION: Methods providing additional information on the disintegration behavior of <b>dispersible</b> <b>tablets</b> compared to standard pharmacopoeia methods were established. Selecting the right type and level of viscosity enhancer and superdisintegrant was critical for developing pediatric tablets with a disintegration time of less than 30 s but still pleasant mouth feel...|$|R
