50|$|The {{other new}} station is Absolute Radio 70s, which {{launched}} on Tuesday 29 November 2011. This station plays a broad mix {{of music from}} the era, ranging from rock and punk, to glam and soul. Announced {{on the same day}} as the 60s service, but launching a week later, Absolute Radio 70s launched on DAB initially in London only, but will also be available nationally and globally online. A website holding page was opened at absoluteradio70s.co.uk in line with the announcement of the station, which carries station information and an <b>indicative</b> <b>schedule.</b> Absolute Radio 70s shares the DAB slot currently used by Absolute Radio 00s, with 00s cutting its broadcast capacity (and switching to broadcast in mono) to release space for the 70s service.|$|E
50|$|Details of Absolute Radio's plan {{to extend}} their decade-themed radio {{stations}} were released in October 2010, and following the success of Absolute Radio 80s and Absolute Radio 90s, the former of which was ranked eleventh in terms of listener numbers. Two new stations were announced, Absolute Radio 60s and Absolute Radio 70s, both {{of which would be}} dedicated to the music of their respective decades. Initially the 70s station would be available on DAB in London only, but would be accessible nationally and internationally through an online service. A website holding page was opened at absoluteradio70s.co.uk in line with the announcement of the station, which carries station information and an <b>indicative</b> <b>schedule.</b> The 60s service went on air on 22 November 2011, with Absolute Radio 70s launching a week later on 29 November.|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} for children to discriminate {{the conditions under which}} attention from teachers is available or unavailable. Past research has shown the effectiveness of and preference for multiple schedules to control individual students 2 ̆ 7 attention seeking responses (i. e., mands); however, limited research has evaluated the efficacy of multiple schedules with groups of students. The purpose of the current study was to assess the efficacy of a multiple <b>schedule</b> <b>indicative</b> of the availability of attention for hand raises during circle time in a typical preschool classroom. Results showed that the rates of hand raises decreased in the extinction component of the multiple schedule and increased or maintained in the reinforcement component for all three classrooms. Rates of interruptions and problem behaviors varied across classrooms. Results suggest that a multiple <b>schedule</b> <b>indicative</b> of the availability of attention from a classroom teacher can be used in typical preschool classrooms to maintain hand raise responses at appropriate levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} new testing methodologies has seen Water Corporation {{evaluate}} its preventative maintenance strategy for its distributed high voltage (“HV”) and low voltage (“LV”), high power electrical equipment. The {{aim of this}} project is to assess the efficacy and applicability of testing methodologies for HV transformers {{in the context of}} Water Corp’s criterion of occupational health and safety (OSH), asset criticality, economics, compliance, skill-set and operating environment and deliver a recommendation. The project develops a framework for the Water Corporation to assess the applicability and efficacy of the testing methodology. Analysis has been carried out in conjunction with ABB (“Asea Brown Boveri”) and Downer Group to gauge the practicality and effectiveness of the testing methodologies and an <b>indicative</b> cost <b>schedule</b> for each methodology has been prepared. The results indicate condition monitoring (“CM”) in the form of yearly inspections and preventative maintenance (“PM”) in the form of dissolved gas in oil analysis (“DGA”) and partial discharge analysis (“PD”) on ‘critical’ transformers should be conducted...|$|R
40|$|A method (200) for {{scheduling}} resources allocation {{within a}} wireless communications network (100) is proposed. The wireless communications network (100) comprises {{at least one}} network cell (110), {{the at least one}} network cell comprising a central unit (105) providing coverage over the network cell and managing at least one transmission frame for putting into communication the central unit with at least one corresponding user equipment (UE 1 -UE 7) within the network cell. The method comprises: retrieving (205) input parameters, said input parameters comprising, for each user equipment, a channel quality parameter indicative of a measured/estimated channel quality based on actual network cell conditions; applying (215) a de-contextualization function to each channel quality parameter for obtaining a corresponding atomic channel quality parameter indicative of the channel quality de-contextualized from the actual network cell conditions; performing (220, 320, 420) a scheduling algorithm for providing a binary allocation matrix <b>indicative</b> of each <b>scheduled</b> physical resource block, transmission frame and user equipment, and applying a contextualization function to said allocation matrix for obtaining indication of transport block size to be used by the scheduled transmission frame for transport blocks transmissions from or towards each scheduled user equipment...|$|R
40|$|Pigeons' key pecks {{produced}} food under second-order schedules of token reinforcement, with {{light-emitting diodes}} serving as token reinforcers. In Experiment 1, tokens were earned {{according to a}} fixed-ratio 50 schedule and were exchanged for food according to either fixed-ratio or variable-ratio exchange schedules, with schedule type varied across conditions. In Experiment 2, schedule type was varied within sessions using a multiple schedule. In one component, tokens were earned according to a fixed-ratio 50 schedule and exchanged according to a variable-ratio schedule. In the other component, tokens were earned according to a variable-ratio 50 schedule and exchanged according to a fixed-ratio schedule. In both experiments, the number of responses per exchange was varied parametrically across conditions, ranging from 50 to 400 responses. Response rates decreased systematically with increases in the fixed-ratio exchange schedules, but were much less affected by changes in the variable-ratio exchange schedules. Response rates were consistently higher under variable-ratio exchange schedules than tinder comparable fixed-ratio exchange schedules, especially at higher exchange ratios. These response-rate differences were due both to greater pre-ratio pausing and to lower local rates tinder the fixed-ratio exchange schedules. Local response rates increased with proximity to food under the higher fixed-ratio exchange <b>schedules,</b> <b>indicative</b> of discriminative control by the tokens...|$|R
40|$|The southernmost {{coast of}} South Africa has been {{proposed}} {{to have been a}} uniquely important region in later human evolution, in part due to the abundance of nutritious and dense coastal resources. Yet, strong contrasts in the Middle Stone Age (MSA) and subsequent Later Stone Age (LSA) archaeological records cast uncertainty on the significance of shellfish utilisation for processes of human evolution. Further, climatic shifts are frequently advanced as drivers of widespread technological change but few climate proxy records correspond adequately to the archaeological evidence at a temporal or spatial level to be unambiguously linked to human cultural activity. This thesis presents a temporally and spatially distributed record of near-shore seasonal sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from serial δ 18 O shell measurements of archaeological Turbo sarmaticus opercula. In addition, the annual timing of shellfish harvesting captured in the temperature signal of the shells' final few growth increments is <b>indicative</b> of the <b>scheduling</b> of foraging behaviours and social organisation. A non-destructive method for evaluating the preservation of the original aragonitic shell carbonate using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry with an attenuated reflectance attachment is presented, allowing for robust SST reconstructions. Near-shore SST reconstructions are presented from the LSA levels of Nelson Bay Cave and Byneskranskop 1, with new radiocarbon chronologies spanning the terminal Pleistocene and the Holocene, and the MSA deposits at Pinnacle Point 5 - 6 and Klasies River Main site, dated to periods in Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 and across the MIS 5 / 4 transition. These reconstructions confirm the utility of near-shore SST records for terrestrial climate reconstructions, indicating summer rainfall shifts during the Holocene and across MIS 5 / 4. The annual timing of shellfish foraging is shown to be markedly different between the MSA and LSA, and more nuanced assessments of foraging behaviours within the MSA and LSA emerge. </p...|$|R
