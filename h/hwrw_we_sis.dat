40|$|Abstract. Factoring-based public-key cryptosystems have {{an overall}} {{complexity}} which {{is dominated by}} the key-production algorithm, which requires the generation of prime numbers. This is most inconvenient in settings where the key-generation is not an one-off process, e. g., secure delegation of computation or EKE password-based key exchange protocols. To this end, we extend the Goldwasser-Micali (GM) cryptosystem to a provably secure system, denoted SIS, where the generation of primes is bypassed. By developing on the correct choice of the parameters of <b>SIS,</b> <b>we</b> align <b>SIS’s</b> security guarantees (i. e., resistance to factoring of moduli, etc.) to those of other well-known factoring-based cryptosystems. Taking into consideration different possibilities to implement the fundamental operations, we explicitly compare and contrast the asymptotic complexity of well-known public-key cryptosystems (e. g., GM and/or RSA) with that of SIS’s. The latter shows that once we are ready to accept an increase {{in the size of the}} moduli, SIS offers a generally lower asymptotic complexity than, e. g., GM or even RSA (when scaling correctly the number of encrypted bits). This would yield most significant speed-ups to applications like the aforementioned secure delegation of computation or protocols where a fresh key needs to be generated with every new session, e. g., EKE password-based key exchange protocols. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>We</b> study <b>SIS</b> {{epidemic}} spreading processes unfolding on {{a recent}} generalisation of the activity-driven modelling framework.

The solutions are general and hold for any joint distribution of activity and attractiveness. The theoretical picture is confirmed via large-scale numerical simulations performed considering heterogeneous distributions and different correlations between the two variables. We find that heterogeneous distributions of attractiveness alter the contagion process. In particular, in case of uncorrelated and positive correlations between the two variables, heterogeneous attractiveness facilitates the spreading. On the contrary, negative correlations between activity and attractiveness hamper the spreading.

We applied collocated co-kriging in SIS to obtain spatial distribution of depositional facies, i.e., paleodepositional trend of all the layers within Mangahewa Formation. Moreover, the reason for choosing SIS over TGS is the simplicity and usability of the algorithm.
