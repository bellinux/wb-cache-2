40|$|Abstract: MAGIC is a {{stereoscopic}} {{system of}} two 17 m diameter Imaging Air Cherenckov Telescopes (IACTs) for γ-ray astronomy. Lowering the energy threshold of IACTs {{is crucial for}} the observation of Pulsars, high redshift AGNs and GRBs.

The Sum-Trigger principle has been proven experimentally in 2007 by decreasing the energy threshold of the first Magic telescope from 55 GeV down to 25 GeV. The first VHE detection for the Crab Pulsar was achieved due to this low threshold. After the upgrade of the MAGIC I and MAGIC II, a new Sum-Trigger system will be installed in both telescopes in Summer 2013. The expected trigger threshold in stereo mode is about 25 - 30 GeV.

40|$|This {{research}} continues {{an ongoing}} {{investigation into the}} disciplinary limits of sound production and composition. These limits, which have their foundation in the institutional and disciplinary setting of the European musical tradition, draw a stark divide between instrumental and non-traditional musical elements. This work collapses these boundaries enabling it to draw on non-musical elements and, alongside traditional instrumentation, treat them for their musical qualities. Just For Show, an interactive soundtrack for a dance theatre production by U. K dance company DV 8, utilised current technologies in order to push the limits of both choreography and sound design. New virtual technologies including <b>digital</b> <b>triggering</b> and light sensors were deployed so that the choreography could be coordinated with the sound and lighting design. Traditional musical elements, such as a cello, were integrated along with typically non-musical elements, such as air-conditioning units, {{as part of a}} process of extending the relationship between music and sound design. The significance of the work is demonstrated by its commission for the play Just For Show by DV 8 Physical Theatre, London. The show was positively reviewed including such comments as ‘almost obscenely good-looking’ The Guardian, UK; ‘Liedtke is the show’s compere, a beautiful golden thread that holds together 75 minutes of a virtual wonderland’ Ballet Magazine, UK...|$|R

A Demonstrator is being built to readout {{a slice of the}} TileCal detector. The on-detector electronics includes up to 48 Analog Front-end Boards for PMT analog signal processing, 4 Main Boards for data digitization and slow controls, 4 Daughter Boards with high speed optical links to interface the on-detector and off-detector electronics. Two super readout driver boards are used for off-detector data acquisition and fulfilling <b>digital</b> <b>trigger.</b> The ATLAS Tile Calorimeter on-detector electronics is housed in the drawers at the back of each of the 256 detector wedges. Each drawer services up to 48 photomultiplier tubes. The new readout system is designed to replace the present system as it will reach component lifetime and radiation tolerance limits making it incompatible with continued use into the HL-LHC era. With demonstrator, we are preparing test samples of each of the components needed for the full upgrade. It is envisioned that at least one drawer of the new electronics will be installed in the detector for the LHC RUN- 2 in 2014. This will permit us to acquire experience and detail studies with fully <b>digital</b> <b>trigger</b> scheme without reconfiguring the present analog trigger system for data taking in 2015 - 2022...|$|E

40|$|Foreseen {{expansion}} and increasing complexity of power distribution networks will increase demand for accurate metering of electric energy flow. The current transformer (CT) {{is widely used}} in measurement systems and has direct effect on the overall accuracy of electric power measurement. Therefore, its design and performance are of great importance. A steady state model of a CT is proposed to relate its performance to basic magnetic properties of its core. It enables a CT amplitude and phase errors to be predicted from the magnetic permeability and power loss of its core. Therefore it can be easily implemented {{at the design stage}} of these devices. The accuracy of the model has been verified against experimental data and the predicted CT errors were found to be in a good agreement with measured values. A negligible leakage reactance design CT is considered in this work, but an additional parameter would have to be considered for gapped cores or non– uniformly distributed windings. CT errors are determined by magnetic properties of its core in a wide flux density range. Measurement of magnetic properties at very low flux densities can be extremely challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio. An accurate, low flux density measurement system has been developed for the investigation of CTs. It features <b>digital</b> <b>triggering,</b> cycles and moving averaging techniques, innovative digital compensation, customised digital feedback algorithm and is capable of measuring magnetic properties of materials at flux densities as low as few µT. This setup can be used for testing variety of ferromagnetic materials for other low flux density applications such as magnetic shielding...|$|R

The feature vector is reduced, encoded, and encrypted as signature of the image. This signature is then embedded into the image using a blind quantization based watermarking algorithm. Typical distortion patterns of malicious image manipulations and image transmissions over lossy channels are used for image authenticity verification.
