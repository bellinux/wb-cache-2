40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the conventional SARIMA {{model and the}} EVT-GARCH model for forecasting electricity prices. However, we find that these models do not adequately capture the important characteristics of the electricity price data. A new model is developed, the EVT-SARIMA model, for forecasting electricity prices which {{is found to be}} the best at modelling the nature of the electricity prices. A time series of half-hourly electricity price data from the Hayward node in New Zealand is transformed into a <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> <b>price</b> series and using this resulting series, appropriate models are fitted for estimating and forecasting. The new EVT-SARIMA model is used to simulate 1000 time series of daily electricity prices, over a 90 day period, to consider strategies for managing the risk associated with price volatility. The effects of different financial instruments on the cumulative distribution functions of predicted revenue obtained using our model are considered. Results suggest that different contracts have different effects on the predicted revenue. However, all contracts have the effect of reducing variability in the predicted revenue values and thus, should be used by a risk manager to reduce the range of probable revenue values. The quantity traded and which contracts to use is dependent on the objectives of the risk manager...|$|E

Three methods are adopted for prices of off-peak hours, peak hours in off-peak months and peak hours in peak months. A nonlinear price regression model with deviation compensation is proposed to forecast the prices of off-peak hours and prices of peak hours in off-peak months.

Pharmaceutical sector is a rapidly growing in Bangladeshi stock market. The objective of this paper is to investigate whether the hybridization of data mining and neural network technique can be applied in predicting the stock price for Pharmaceutical sector of Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE). Methods/Analysis: This study uses daily trade data for Pharmaceutical sector of DSE. We have analysed the behaviour of <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> <b>price</b> for Pharmaceutical sector of DSE. For this study, 6 top listed pharmaceutical companies have been selected to perform the analysis and selected time frame for the research is 15 years (2000 - 2015). The analysis is performed in two stages where first stage performs the K-means clustering of data mining method to discover the stock with most useful pattern and second stage applies the nonlinear autoregressive with Exogenous Input neural network method to predict the closing price for the selected stock. Findings: The prediction performance through the hybridization of data mining and neural network technique is evaluated and positive performance improvement of prediction is observed which is very encouraging for investors. The research also depicts that hybridization of data mining and neural network technique can be applied in determining the stock investment decision for Pharmaceutical sector of DSE though the impact of many different information has greater influence in determining the stock price. Novelty/Improvement: We intend to apply the data mining and optimized neural network in predicting stock market.

In this paper, a model is developed for volatility Clustering in electricity price return series and its application for forecasting VaR is demonstrated. The first model is using GARCH (1, 1). The VaR of variance rate series, that is worst-case volatility is calculated using variance method using wavelet transform. The model is used to forecast variance rate (volatility) for a sample case of 1 -week half-hourly price return series. The second model developed is for forecasting VaR for price return series of 440 days. This model is developed using wavelets via multi-resolution analysis and uses regime-switching technique.

We selected the appropriate order of GARCH for each of the stocks using AIC instead of using the most commonly used GARCH (1, 1). GARCH (4, 2) best fitted Kakuzi data and GARCH (5, 4) BAT data. From the residual analysis the models performs well and we therefore used them in estimating VaR of each of the stocks. Backtesting a VaR model is important as it helps determine whether the model is able to capture risk well.
