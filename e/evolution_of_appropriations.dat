40|$|At {{the end of}} September 2008, a {{conflict}} arose between the Senate and the House of Representatives, fuelled by the opposing opinions of their respective clerks. The disagreement centred on {{the constitutionality of the}} introduction of a Bill in the Senate by a private member that increased expenditure under a standing appropriation. The debate unfolded in the Houses of Parliament, the newspapers and over the airwaves. This article discusses the background to the standoff before considering the historical context of the constitutional restrictions governing the parliamentary process for appropriations. The <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>appropriations</b> in the Australian federation informs this debate, and the nature of "standing appropriations" in the current budgetary system is investigated. Finally, the article assesses the divergent opinions held by the two Houses in the 2008 controversy before advancing the preferred constitutional view of the situation. Ultimately, it is believed the actions of the Senate were misguided and arguably unconstitutional. Gabrielle J Appleby and John M Williams[URL]...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appropriation</b> and meaning <b>of</b> the hijab {{in the modern}} Middle East. During colonial times the veil’s depiction {{as a sign of}} backwardness, in social artifacts and in colonial discourse, was used to justify colonialism. Following the colonial period, indigenous scholars and other elites called for unveiling, seeing the hijab as an obstacle to “progress. ” However, in the 1970 s, a new veiling movement emerged that appropriated the veil as a sign of an authentic identity and an instrument to accommodate a changing modern world. This neo-veiling movement, furthermore, standardized a set of Islamic norms and practices that would use the veil as the embodiment of inner piety and ethical states. It is within this context that this thesis discusses contemporary pious fashion in Amman, Jordan. The ethics and aesthetics of veiling in Amman have again shifted the meaning and <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> the veil. Establishing an agreement or balance between piety and fashion/ethics and aesthetics in veiling is significant for contemporary urban residents of Amman. Furthermore, this balance has social significance and guides social and cultural interactions. Harmony, however, is not easily achieved; pious fashion is a complicated maze that is carefully navigated by veiled women. honors thesis 2013 International Comparative Studie...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} origin, <b>evolution,</b> and <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> social capital by new ventures seeking {{international}} growth. Using longitudinal case {{studies in the}} software industry, we model the dynamic influence of social capital on new venture internationalization. We theorize that new ventures of founders from a globally-connected environment, such as with return migration or MNC experience, have higher stocks of initial social capital than others. We provide a nuanced analysis of the dynamic processes involved in the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> social capital, and highlight the mechanisms of decay and replenishment over time. Network learning plays {{a critical role in}} new ventures' ability to realize the potential contribution of social capital to international growth. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors.

40|$|International audienceAppropriation of {{technology}} is a process by which users complete the work of designers by making interactive systems functional within the frame of their situated activities. While existing theories and studies about appropriation are oriented toward psychological or organizational dimension of this process, we propose a model to describe <b>appropriation</b> process through <b>evolutions</b> <b>of</b> digital artifacts and information structures. A case study shows that this model helps to identify some operations carried out by user to transform digital material in regard <b>of</b> the <b>appropriation</b> process. These findings open perspectives to bridge scattered theoretical approach <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> around a low-level, artifact-oriented, and objective way <b>of</b> describing <b>appropriation.</b> It also could help design-for-appropriation by bringing more focus on technical aspect of interactive systems...|$|R
40|$|Engaging {{end-users}} and user {{communities to}} take an active part in the co-creation, <b>evolution,</b> and <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> modern, interactive systems has become an increasingly important issue over the last years. Bringing together existing research and experiences as well as new challenges such as long-term, large-scale, or highly distributed stakeholders has led to the notion of Open Design Spaces (ODS) to frame and reflect current developments of distributed codesign. Several, formerly often separated strands of research covering different aspects of these challenges have emerged and led to a growing community of researchers and practitioners building on concepts such as Participatory Design, Meta-Design, and End-User Development. Building on two successful predecessors on the topic with more than 50 international researchers and practitioners, the workshop at DIS 2010 focuses particularly on social aspects and community co-creation in Open Design Spaces...|$|R
40|$|Through a {{critical}} {{examination of the}} works of Tom Robbins, this thesis interrogates the historical <b>evolution</b> and <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> the magic(al) realist tradition. In so doing, it situates Robbins’ writing within the framework of postmodernism, and explores the ontological implications inherent in Robbins’ use of magic(al) realist concepts and conventions. With a specific emphasis on the notion of cultural consciousness, this thesis analyzes the object- oriented cosmologies embodied and espoused in three of Robbins’ novels: Still Life with Woodpecker (1980), Skinny Legs and All (1990), and B is for Beer (2009). It unpacks the ideological figuration of various textual devices evident in Another Roadside Attraction (1971) and Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1976) – particularly the gendered use of unreliable narrators – and, with reference to Jitterbug Perfume (1984), relates Robbins’ <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> the magic(al) realist tradition to the American counterculture movement of the 1960 s and 70 s. Employing poststructuralist, feminist, ecofeminist, and postcolonial discourses, this thesis ultimately seeks to position Robbins’ writing {{within the context of a}} radical emancipatory politics that views (and uses) literature as an ideological space in which to challenge, reinterpret, and democratize Western metanarratives...|$|R
40|$|This {{collection}} of papers {{reflects on the}} many dimensions of contemporary narratives of iconography in public culture in Australia and Asia. The idea for the volume arose {{from a series of}} seminars held at the Centre for Cross-Cultural Research in 2002. The series ‘Iconographies’ was convened by Penny Edwards and centred on research undertaken in the Asia-Pacific, with papers that interrogated national and cultural icons. Just as a biography might examine the makings of a particular personality and her or his shaping of inner and outer worlds, so also iconographic narratives that trace and explore both the <b>evolution</b> and <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> particular icons help us mark key moments in the cultural politics of communities, nations and global public spheres. The present volume has two papers (Taylor and Seth) from that series and others on the themes of iconography and iconoclasm that were solicited from a group of interdisciplinary authors working on these themes...|$|R

40|$|This thesis studies {{contemporary}} poetry’s {{innovations in}} textual borrowing {{and the range}} and scope of its appropriative practices. The restrictions of the inherited definitions <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> include a limited capacity for expression and meaningfulness, a partial concept of appropriation’s critical capacity, and an inadequate sense of the poet’s individual and unique practice <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> This thesis resolves the problematic constraints limiting contemporary definitions <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> by tracing {{the history of the}} practice to reveal an enduring relation between appropriation and poetic expression. Close readings of Trevor Joyce’s, Alan Halsey’s, and Susan Howe’s poetry serve as evidence of contemporary poetry’s development <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> beyond the current ascriptions and offer some direction on how the critical understanding <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> might be extended and redefined. Here, appropriation is recognized as another source of lyric expression, critical innovation, and conceptual development in contemporary poetry. This thesis encourages a new perspective on the purpose and processes <b>of</b> poetic <b>appropriation</b> and the consequences of its declarative potential for both poet and poem...|$|R

Such preservation efforts are literally significant for they provide examples <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> that are done not out {{of an attempt to}} oppress European and African culture, but to integrate it into the developing Southern culture.

40|$|This article {{introduces}} the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in debates {{on how to}} account for migrants’ capacity to defy restrictive border controls and migration policies. What the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> better captures than concepts like agency or resistance is the multi-faceted and intricate intertwinement of border regimes and migratory practices. The article illustrates this advantage through {{an analysis of the}} phenomenon of bezness. The term refers to a migration strategy of aspiring migrants who seduce and subsequently marry European tourists as a way to gain entry to and residency in Europe. This article develops a reading of bezness as a mode <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> mobility which is intertwined with the border regime in at least four ways: First, bezness is provoked by restrictive visa policies that create a highly unequal access to mobility and life opportunities. The case of bezness illustrates, second, that migrants try to recode the methods, logics and effects of mobility control into means <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> Migrants’ practices <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> involve, third, the clandestine transgression of the norms, rules and regulations that define particular border regimes. Finally, the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> permits to recognise that the European border regime operates as an apparatus of capture that tries to recuperate migrants’ practices in order to turn them into a driving force for its own development. The example of bezness demonstrates, moreover, that these processes of recuperation also feature the mobilisation of emotions – in this case of romantic love – as technologies of government...|$|R

40|$|According to Locke, {{appropriation}} is {{a precondition}} for moral responsibility and thus we can expect that it plays a distinctive role in his theory. Yet it is rare to find an interpretation of Locke’s account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> that does not associate it with serious problems. To {{make room for a}} more satisfying understanding of Locke’s account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> we have to analyse why it was so widely misunderstood. The aim of this paper is fourfold: First, I will show that Mackie’s and Winkler’s interpretations that have shaped the subsequent discussion contain serious flaws. Second, I will argue that the so-called appropriation interpretation —that is the view that appropriation is meant to provide alternative persistence conditions for persons—lacks support. Third, I will re-examine Locke’s texts and argue that we can come {{to a better understanding of}} his notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in the Essay if we interpret it in analogy to his account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in Two Treatises. Fourth, I will offer a more fine-grained interpretation of the role <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in relation to persistence conditions for persons. I conclude by showing that the advantage of this proposal is that it reconciles interpretations that have commonly been thought to be inconsistent...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe stated aim of {{this conference}} is to debate the {{continuing}} <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> IS in businesses and other organisations. This paper seeks to contribute to this debate by exploring the concept <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> {{from a number of}} different epistemological, cultural and linguistic viewpoints to allow us to explore 'the black box' <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> and to gain a fuller understanding of the term. At the conceptual level, it will examine some of the different ways in which people have attempted to explain the relationship between the objective and concrete features of technology and the subjective and shifting nature of the people and organisation within which that technology is deployed. At the cultural and linguistic level the paper will examine the notion as it is found in the Francophone literature, where the term has a long and rich history, and the Anglophone literature where appropriation is seen as a rather more specialist term. The paper will conclude with some observations on the ongoing nature of the debate, the value of reading beyond the literature with which one is familiar and the rewards that come from exploring different historical (and linguistic) viewpoints...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} of global commons is of vital importance for modern society. The current solutions attempt to internalize the cost <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> commons by adding {{this to the}} cost of private resources. In this paper we will show that this approach has some fundamental weaknesses. To overcome these shortcomings, we have proposed to segregate the {{management of}} private and shared resources by using non-scalar numbers for the underlying economic signals of money and price. We prove that the resulting non-scalar economy always reaches a macro-economic equilibrium point where the level <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> commons by the society remains steady. The second contribution {{of this paper is to}} show that the proposed design of the non-scalar economy would guarantee the accuracy of price signal with respect to the <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> commons. In other words, rational economic agents would ensure that the price neither underestimates nor overestimates the actual level <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> incurred. This will provide a powerful basis for an effective market system for the commons...|$|R
