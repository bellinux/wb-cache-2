25|$|A very frail Ethel {{returns to}} Albert Square in 2000, {{arriving}} unannounced at Pauline Fowler's (Wendy Richard) house. Ethel {{had run away}} from her retirement village and had decided that she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to the square, {{to live in the}} place she loves with her old friends. Ethel is now restricted to a wheelchair and it is left to Dot to cater for her every need, which often leaves her exhausted. Ethel appears to have lost none of her zest for life, despite her considerable age, so it is a huge shock to Dot when Ethel reveals that she is suffering from terminal cancer and is not going to live much longer. Ethel reveals that she has come home to the square to die, but instead of waiting to die in agony, she wants to choose her final moments so she can die with dignity.|$|E

The episode also features the return of former series regular Zach Woods as Gabe Lewis. Woods was introduced in the sixth season episode [...] "Sabre" [...] and was added to the series as a regular with the premiere of the seventh season.

As season eight was nearly over, the producers and writers decided to refuse Mulder re-admittance into the FBI as a way to segue John Doggett and Monica Reyes into the series as the new main stars of season nine. David Duchovny agreed with this method, noting, [...] "I completely thought it was correct that they should be trying to focus elsewhere, and that, since I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> for the second half of season eight, if you were to refocus on whatever Mulder's up to, you'd be in the same lousy situation at the beginning of season nine." ...|$|E

Sure enough, the zombie [...] invasion happened and they all came back again, and I was like, 'Ah, I knew that I should've made my zombie film.'"

500|$|When Fiasco was 18, {{he began}} {{creating}} {{music as a}} solo artist in his father's basement, even though his parents were not keen on having their son be a rapper. He scoured flea markets and secondhand stores, where {{he was able to}} find an old mixing board and a record player, stacks of vinyl records, and mic stands. [...] At age 19, Fiasco joined a group called Da Pak, which was influenced by other California gangsta rappers such as Spice 1 and Ice Cube. Da Pak signed to Epic Records and released one single before splitting up. Fiasco later described the experience, saying [...] "We had a song out about cocaine, guns, and women, and I would go to a record store and look at it and think, 'What are you doing?' I felt like a hypocrite. I was acting like this rapper who would never be judged, and I had to destroy that guy.

500|$|Just as the {{aircraft}} hit takeoff speed, the No.1 Engine and its pylon assembly {{separated from the}} left wing, ripping away a [...] section of the leading edge with it. The combined unit flipped {{over the top of}} the wing and landed on the runway. Robert Graham, supervisor of maintenance for American Airlines, stated: [...] "As {{the aircraft}} got closer, I noticed what appeared to be vapor or smoke of some type coming from the leading edge of the wing and the No. 1 engine pylon. I noticed that the No. 1 engine was bouncing up and down quite a bit and just about the time the aircraft got opposite my position and started rotation, the engine came off, went up {{over the top of the}} wing, and rolled back down onto the runway... Before going over the wing, the engine went forward and up just as if it had lift and was actually climbing. It didn't strike the top of the wing on its way, rather it followed the clear path of the airflow of the wing, up and over the top of it, then down below the tail. The aircraft continued a fairly normal climb until it started a turn to the left. And at that point, I thought he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to the airport." ...|$|E

5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.|$|R
500|$|During the U.S. third leg, it was {{reported}} that Born to Run would be featured in its entirety during several shows, possibly in a scheme to boost ticket sales. [...] The full-album idea took fruition with the late September-early October set of five shows at Giants Stadium, which would be the final concerts ever in that venue in Springsteen's home state. [...] Born to Run was played at two shows, Darkness on the Edge of Town at one show, and Born in the U.S.A. at two shows. [...] Springsteen later said of the full album idea, [...] "We had done so many shows and were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> around one more time, so we were like, 'OK, what can we do that we haven't done? Let's try to play some of the albums.' There were some people who were starting to do it, it sounded like a good idea, and my audience fundamentally experienced all my music in album form. People took Born to Run home and played it start to finish 100 times; they didn't slip on a cut in the middle. And we made albums – we took a long time, and we built them to last. ... Those records are packed with songs that have lasted 30–35 years. It simply was a way to revitalize the show and do something appealing and fun for the fans, but it ended up being a much bigger emotional experience than I thought it would be." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the course}} of some intense hanging out (with Gene Roland), I had played a {{recording}} of a 12-tone blues that I'd written (doesn't everybody?) while studying at the Westlake College of Music in Hollywood. According to Gene Roland, who had been writing for Kenton for some time, Stan {{had been talking about}} a more contrapuntal, linear type of music, and Gene felt that my piece lay in the direction that Stan was considering. While I was away on a short trip with Charlie Barnet, Gene took the recording to Kenton, and when I returned, Stan called. We met, talked, and he asked me to write a couple of pieces for the band. Being young and ambitious, I reached too far in the writing and exceeded my limits - the charts were disasters and never heard of again - but Stan gamely suggested that I do another. By this time I'd heard {{some of the things that}} Gerry Mulligan was bringing in, and with a slightly better idea of what was <b>going</b> on, managed <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> down <b>to</b> earth and brought in a better effort, though it, too, was never heard of again.|$|R

2500|$|After Lindros criticized Worley in March 2000 {{for failing}} to {{diagnose}} a concussion (his second of the season), Clarke stripped Lindros {{of the role of}} team captain. A few weeks after suffering a third concussion during practice, Lindros returned to the Flyers lineup for Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals and sustained his fourth concussion of the season (his sixth in 27 months) during Game 7.

[...] Lindros never played for the Flyers again, as he rejected the Flyers qualifying offer in the off-season and sat out the 2000–01 season. Lindros pushed for a trade to Toronto but that move fell apart at last minute when Clarke and Leafs manager Pat Quinn could not agree on terms. [...] Clarke finally traded Lindros to the New York Rangers in August 2001. Following the trade, Clarke said, [...] "I don't give a crap whether he ever plays again or if I ever see him again.

Framton goes to visit Mrs Sappleton and, while he is waiting for her to come down, is entertained by her fifteen-year-old, witty niece. The niece tells him that the French window is kept open, even though it is October, because Mrs Sappleton believes that her husband and her brothers, who were drowned in a bog three years before, will come back one day.

Mrs Sappleton cannot understand why he has run away and, when her husband and her brothers come in, she tells them about the odd man who has just left. The niece explains that Framton Nuttel ran away because of the spaniel: he is afraid of dogs since he was hunted by a pack of stray dogs in India and had to spend a night in the newly dug grave with creatures grinning and foaming just above him.
