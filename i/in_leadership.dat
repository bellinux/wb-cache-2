40|$|The paper explores two logics {{of global}} leadership; {{the logic of}} instrumentality and the logic of appropriateness. These two logics and their {{relation}} to multinational enterprises are traced in organizational theory and <b>in</b> global <b>leadership</b> theory {{and the consequences of}} the two logics for the design of global leadership development programs are explored. It is argued that applying a logic of instrumentality uncritically to global <b>leadership</b> <b>in</b> multinational enterprises is potentially fraught with great risk given the diversity and complexity of MNEs and their environments. It is suggested that a logic of appropriateness <b>in</b> global <b>leadership</b> and <b>in</b> global <b>leadership</b> development programs constitutes a viable, suitable and complementary alternative. What is referred to as a mixed service logic of global leadership development programs involves exploration and reflection concerning the particular contexts <b>in</b> which global <b>leadership</b> processes and exemplifies a logic of appropriateness <b>in</b> global <b>leadership</b> and global leadership development...|$|R

To replace the vacated offensive coordinator position, Shaw selected Stanford wide receivers coach Pep Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|Boycott's {{eight seasons}} of {{captaincy}} were among Yorkshire's least successful. The club {{failed to win}} any competitions and ranked low in the Championship table, in contrast to their one-time dominance of English cricket. The {{beginning of the end}} of his captaincy came after BBC Radio Leeds interviews in which two Yorkshire committee members and former players, Don Brennan and Mel Ryan, said that a change <b>in</b> <b>leadership</b> was needed. Boycott himself did not suffer a loss of form to mirror that of his county; in his first year as captain, he scored 2,503runs at an average of 100.12, included a century in his first match as captain. His success was cited by Trueman as evidence that his selfish nature was harming Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Corley instituted {{sweeping}} changes <b>in</b> <b>leadership</b> in the regiment, hoping {{to improve its}} combat performance. He was able {{to cut down on}} straggling to a degree with more strict threats of court martial, but this had a negative effect on the regiment's morale. He began a unit newspaper, eventually called Eagle Forward, and moved to allow more discourse for the soldiers and leaders of the unit, and this was shown to improve the morale to a degree. Wanting to build a sense of pride in the unit, he sought to emphasize the toughness of the battles the regiment had seen, and played up its victory at the Battle of Yechon while downplaying other poor performances.|$|E

5|$|Lampugnano, {{unfortunately}} for the Guelphs, was considered a martyr for the Republic. This was made worse {{by the fact that}} the Guelphs <b>in</b> <b>leadership</b> refused to run elections in April, until in June they were forced by the populace. Ghibelline families took the reins of Milan in this election, and the Guelphs were defeated. However, the reprisals against the Guelphs, including the imprisonment of Appiani and Ossona who had been blamed (probably unjustly) for the massacre, led the populace to violently depose the Ghibellines and reinstall the extremist Guelphs. Gonzaga, however, whose friend Galeotto Toscano was killed in the uprising, departed Milan for Crema, hoping to make peace with Sforza.|$|E
5|$|Many senior officers, {{particularly}} the Catholic Generals Khiêm and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, decried what they {{viewed as a}} handing of power to the Buddhist leaders. They tried to remove Khánh in favor of Minh, and recruited many officers to their plot. Khiêm and Thieu sought out US Ambassador Maxwell Taylor for a private endorsement of their plan, but Taylor did not want any more changes <b>in</b> <b>leadership,</b> fearing a corrosive effect on the already-unstable government. This deterred Khiêm's group from acting on their plans.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the faith}} are {{defensive}} {{of the fact that}} some practices seem to restrict women and make gender equality <b>in</b> <b>leadership</b> impossible. They are only permitted to enter special sections of the temple reserved for women or have to go to separate women's temples. As with practices of niddah in Orthodox Judaism, concepts of pollution associated with the menstrual cycle lead to the exclusion of women from the temples and daily worship during the affected time. Swaminarayan also directed male devotees not to listen to religious discourses given by women.|$|E

The beads are presented together with a taupe neckerchief bearing a tartan patch of the Maclaren clan, honoring William de Bois Maclaren, who donated the £7000 to purchase Gilwell Park in 1919 plus an additional £3000 for improvements to the house that was on the estate. The neckerchief with the braided leather woggle (neckerchief slide) denotes the membership of the 1st Gilwell Scout Group or Gilwell Troop 1. Recipients of the Wood Badge are known as Wood Badgers or Gilwellians.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{traveled}} to Richmond, {{where he received}} permission to raise an independent company of mounted infantry to provide defense along the border. Parsons set about enrolling volunteers, and within {{a short period of}} time, he enlisted approximately 30 men. Following its organization, the company became known as the Huckleberry Rangers of the Confederate States Army's 13th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The following personnel were elected to serve <b>in</b> <b>leadership</b> positions within the company: Parsons as its captain in command; John Blue, first lieutenant; and his son Isaac Parsons, Jr., second lieutenant. Parsons and his company utilized flintlock muskets, which they had retrieved from the loft of the courthouse, and additional sabres and flintlock horse pistols which had last been used during the American Revolutionary War. Parsons provided Lt. Blue with a Minié ball rifle reportedly seized from John Brown at Harpers Ferry.|$|E

40|$|The {{government}} of Vanuatu ratified the Convention on the Elimination {{of all forms}} of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1995. Following the ratification, Gender Equity in Education Policy was developed in 2005 by the Ministry of Education of Vanuatu. One of the objectives was {{to increase the number of}} women principals. However, recent statistics on women <b>in</b> educational <b>leadership</b> <b>in</b> Vanuatu show a decline in the number of women principals. The low percentage of women <b>in</b> educational <b>leadership</b> <b>in</b> the secondary schools of Vanuatu indicates that gender equity <b>in</b> educational <b>leadership</b> is still far from being achieved. This study looks at how Vanuatu culture affects women's <b>leadership</b> <b>in</b> secondary schools and identifies ways <b>in</b> which women's <b>leadership</b> might be developed. Qualitative methods were employed to study the experiences of six women leaders and five aspiring women leaders in several Vanuatu secondary schools. The findings from the study indicate three main areas inherent in Vanuatu culture that significantly impact upon the leadership practices of the participants. The findings reveal the existence of entrenched cultural barriers in the education system, in the social structures of Vanuatu and in the attitudes of individual men, women and some students towards women leaders. These barriers, it seems, are the major impediments to women's advancement <b>in</b> educational <b>leadership</b> <b>in</b> Vanuatu secondary schools...|$|R
