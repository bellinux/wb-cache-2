5|$|Most of the {{available}} information relating to the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many letters that Monteverdi wrote. These papers provide <b>irrefutable</b> evidence that four of these works—L'Arianna, Andromeda, Proserpina rapita and Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia—were completed and performed in Monteverdi's lifetime, but of their music, only the famous lament from L'Arianna and a trio from Proserpina {{are known to have}} survived. The other three lost operas—Le nozze di Tetide, La finta pazza Licori and Armida abbandonata—were abandoned by Monteverdi before completion; how much of their music was actually written is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{archaeological evidence}} for the domestication of the horse comes from sites in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, dating to approximately 3500–4000 BC. By 3000 BC, the horse was completely domesticated and by 2000 BC there was {{a sharp increase in}} the number of horse bones found in human settlements in northwestern Europe, indicating the spread of domesticated horses throughout the continent. The most recent, but most <b>irrefutable</b> evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse remains were interred with chariots in graves of the Sintashta and Petrovka cultures c. 2100 BC.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that the MOT inspection provides an <b>irrefutable</b> record of a vehicle's mileage. However, although the mileage is recorded during the test, {{no part of the}} inspection requires the test station to verify that this is indeed the actual mileage. It is merely recorded, and any tampering of an odometer would not be discovered as part of the MOT inspection.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} {{building}} two chancels {{is not entirely}} clear. Many scholars {{suggest that there is}} some symbolic significance, such as empire and church, or body and spirit, but no <b>irrefutable</b> evidence for these theories exists. Others claim that the construction has a functional purpose for ceremonial processions. Whatever the original intent of the double chancel, the eastern chancel came to serve as the location for the mass and the western chancel was reserved for the bishop and pontiffs.|$|E
25|$|Chaix d'Est-Ange {{and other}} early genealogists and authors not only complained about {{problems}} with each others' published works regarding the Forcade family, they also published erroneous, incomplete and unsourced information {{in their own}} works in trying to substantiate the family's nobility and disprove each other. Although {{they were supposed to}} cite concrete, if not <b>irrefutable,</b> proof of lineage and ancestry in their published works, it was neither they nor their published works that determined the Forcade family's nobility. They simply reported it.|$|E
25|$|During the era, the American press did {{not always}} {{publicize}} reports of Nazi atrocities in full or with prominent placement. By 1942, after newspapers began to report details of the Holocaust, articles were extremely short and were buried deep in the newspaper. These reports were either denied or unconfirmed by the United States government. When it did receive <b>irrefutable</b> evidence that the reports were true (and photographs of mass graves and murder in Birkenau camp in 1943, with victims moving into the gas chambers), U.S. officials suppressed the information and classified it as secret. It is possible lives of European Jews could have been saved.|$|E

25|$|Oddly, Cassini {{seems to}} have {{abandoned}} this reasoning, which Rømer adopted and set about buttressing in an <b>irrefutable</b> manner, using a selected number of observations performed by Picard and himself between 1671 and 1677. Rømer presented his results to the French Academy of Sciences, and it was summarised soon after by an anonymous reporter in a short paper, , published 7 December 1676 in the Journal des sçavans. Unfortunately the paper bears the stamp of the reporter failing to understand Rømer's presentation, and as the reporter resorted to cryptic phrasings to hide his lack of understanding, he obfuscated Rømer's reasoning in the process. Unfortunately Rømer himself never published his results.|$|E
25|$|The {{most obvious}} example of Russian {{support to the}} Abkhaz side in 1993 was the bombing of Georgian-held Sukhumi by Russian fighter-bombers. The Russian Defence {{minister}} Pavel Grachev consistently denied it, but after Georgians succeeded in bringing down one SU-27 fighter-bomber and UN experts identified the dead pilot as Russian it became <b>irrefutable.</b> Nevertheless, some equipment {{was turned over to}} Georgia according to the previous agreements in 1993. Russian general Grachev claimed that Georgian side has painted the aircraft to resemble Russian Air Force aircraft and bombed their own positions, killing hundreds of their own people in Eshera and Sukhumi. This statement raised anger and utter contempt among Georgians toward the Russian side.|$|E
25|$|In the {{scientific}} method, parsimony is an epistemological, metaphysical or heuristic preference, not an <b>irrefutable</b> principle of logic or a scientific result. As a logical principle, Occam's razor would demand that scientists accept the simplest possible theoretical explanation for existing data. However, science has shown repeatedly that future data often support more complex theories than do existing data. Science prefers the simplest explanation {{that is consistent}} with the data available at a given time, but the simplest explanation may be ruled out as new data become available. That is, science is open to the possibility that future experiments might support more complex theories than demanded by current data and is more interested in designing experiments to discriminate between competing theories than favoring one theory over another based merely on philosophical principles.|$|E
25|$|The film-makers were {{commissioned}} to provide <b>irrefutable</b> {{evidence of the}} Nazis' crimes, and the film recorded the liberation of Nazi concentration camps. The film was originally intended to be broadcast to the Germans following World War II, but the British government deemed it too traumatic to be shown to the already-shocked post-War population. Instead, it was transferred in 1952 from the British War Office film vaults to London's Imperial War Museum and remained unreleased until 1985, when an edited version was first broadcast in May 1985 as an episode of the PBS network series Frontline under the title which the Imperial War Museum had given it: Memory of the Camps. The full-length version of the film German Concentration Camps Factual Survey was completed in 2014, and was restored by film scholars at the Imperial War Museum.|$|E
25|$|One approach, {{suggested}} by {{writers such as}} Stephen D. Unwin, is to treat (particular versions of) theism and naturalism {{as though they were}} two hypotheses in the Bayesian sense, to list certain data (or alleged data), about the world, and to suggest that the likelihoods of these data are significantly higher under one hypothesis than the other. Most of the arguments for, or against, the existence of God can be seen as pointing to particular aspects of the universe in this way. In almost all cases it is not seriously {{suggested by}} proponents of the arguments that they are <b>irrefutable,</b> merely that they make one worldview seem significantly more likely than the other. However, since an assessment of the weight of evidence depends on the prior probability that is assigned to each worldview, arguments that a theist finds convincing may seem thin to an atheist and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, {{experts from}} the Library of Congress {{traveled}} to Moscow to copy previously secret archives of the CPUSA records, sent to the Soviet Union for safekeeping by party organizers. The records provided an <b>irrefutable</b> link between Soviet intelligence and information obtained by the CPUSA and its contacts in the U.S. government from the 1920s through the 1940s. Some documents revealed that the CPUSA was actively involved in secretly recruiting party members from African-American groups and rural farm workers. Other CPUSA records contained further evidence that Soviet sympathizers had indeed infiltrated the State Department, beginning in the 1930s. Included in CPUSA archival records were confidential letters from two U.S. ambassadors in Europe to Roosevelt and a senior State Department official. Thanks to an official in the U.S. Department of State sympathetic to the party, the confidential correspondence, concerning political and economic matters in Europe, {{ended up in the}} hands of Soviet intelligence.|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} {{the second half of the}} colonial period, 1895 to 1945, is highly remarked as {{political}} stability and economic growth which accelerated modernization in Taiwan. The competition between the Japanese colonial Government-General and the native Taiwanese elite in the course of its modernization draw many young Taiwanese dream of being artists in a way of provoking improvement of their social status or cultivation of new knowledge which is more suitable to a modern society. Therefore, due to the trend of the campaign for modernization in Taiwan, many young native Taiwanese students went to study abroad, mostly in Japan from the late 1910s and some went to Paris in the 1930s. And indeed they became the pioneers in the era of the flourish cultural movement in Taiwan. It is <b>irrefutable</b> that literature had extraordinary importance in a socio-political and cultural context in the period from the 1920s to around the 1930s with the growing stimulation between writers and painters through shared interest in learning about modernization. The group of artists, painters including some major artists Chen Qingfen, Yang Shilong, Yang Sanlang and Liu Chi-hsiang, are characterized by westernized artistic expression and their own interpretation of time and place which represents a modern political and as well as cultural movement that were emerged by the landed-gentry who strongly resist against the Japanese colonial governors. One of the Japanese art critics recounts that the steady economic growth and great increase of public interest in art with numerous art exhibitions by single and group artists had attracted both Taiwanese and Taiwan-born Japanese artists return to Taiwan and share their works with audiences.|$|E
25|$|The committal {{hearing to}} {{determine}} if there was sufficient evidence for Einem to stand trial for murder began on 20 February 1984. Faced with <b>irrefutable</b> evidence from prosecutors that Kelvin had been in his company, Einem suddenly changed his story to answer that evidence and admitted that he had been in contact with Richard Kelvin on the night of 5 June 1983. Einem said that he was driving along O'Connell Street in North Adelaide looking for a parking spot in order to buy some dinner. While looking for a parking spot in a side street, Einem said that he had nearly run over Kelvin as he jogged in from his side. Einem stated he thought Kelvin had bisexual tendencies and said {{that the two of them}} then had a conversation about problems Kelvin had been having at school, and Kelvin willingly got into the car and they drove to Einem's home. This answered the question of how fibres from Einem's carpet had got onto Kelvin's clothes. To answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's bed had come to be on Kelvin's clothes, Einem stated that the two of them had sat on his bed and played with the large harp which he kept in his bedroom. Police previously did see this harp in his room when they seized the drugs. Finally, to answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's cardigan had got onto Kelvin, Einem stated that he had put his arm around Kelvin and hugged him because Kelvin was upset about how his peers had been bullying him at school. With all the fibres being accounted for with his new story, Einem concluded his statement by saying that Kelvin had stayed for two hours before Einem dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD near the Royal Adelaide Hospital and gave Kelvin $20 to pay for a taxi home.|$|E

[...] The show deals with the theme of death, which Tsamere said is [...] "a bit strange, but it has the virtue of attracting the public's attention".

500|$|García Márquez's grandmother, Doña Tranquilina Iguarán Cotes, {{played an}} {{influential}} {{role in his}} upbringing. He {{was inspired by the}} way she [...] "treated the extraordinary as something perfectly natural." [...] The house was filled with stories of ghosts and premonitions, omens and portents, all of which were studiously ignored by her husband. According to García Márquez she was [...] "the source of the magical, superstitious and supernatural view of reality". He enjoyed his grandmother's unique way of telling stories. No matter how fantastic or improbable her statements, she always delivered {{them as if they were}} the <b>irrefutable</b> truth.

500|$|In 1840, {{contemporaneous}} {{with the}} affair in Rhodes, a more famous case of blood libel, {{known as the}} Damascus affair, was developing in Damascus, while the city was under the short-lived control of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. On February 5, Capuchin friar Thomas and his servant Ibrahim Amara went missing, and the Jews of Damascus were accused of murdering them to collect their blood for Passover matzos. [...] The local Christian community, the governor, and the French consul, who received full support from Paris, actively pursued the ritual murder charge. The accused Jews were tortured, {{and some of them}} confessed to having killed Father Thomas and his servant. Their testimonies were used by the accusers as the <b>irrefutable</b> proof of guilt.

500|$|Christians of many {{denominations}} treat What's So Amazing About Grace? as a handbook. In it, Yancey {{coined the}} phrase [...] "scandal of grace", {{referring to the}} idea that God may choose to forgive people who have done evil deeds, citing the conversion of Paul the Apostle who was persecuting Christians. The phrase [...] "scandal of grace" [...] has become widely used in Christian circles. In 2005, the Barna Group, a California-based research firm, asked senior pastors across the United States which books they had found helpful during the past three years. What's So Amazing About Grace? was one of nine books mentioned by at least two percent of the respondents; the other eight included Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Church and The Purpose Driven Life and John C. Maxwell's The 21 <b>Irrefutable</b> Laws of Leadership.|$|E
500|$|The first work to {{advocate}} {{the idea of}} intentionality was published in 1854 by Joaquim Noberto de Sousa e Silva, after Pedro II had opened the debate. Since then, several scholars have subscribed to that view, including Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen, Capistrano de Abreu, Pedro Calmon, Fábio Ramos and Mário Barata. Historian Hélio Vianna affirmed that [...] "although {{there are signs of}} the intentionality" [...] in Cabral's discovery, [...] "based mainly in the knowledge or previous suspicion of the existence of lands {{at the edge of the}} South Atlantic", there are no <b>irrefutable</b> proofs to support it. This opinion is also shared by historian Thomas Skidmore. The debate on whether it was a deliberate voyage of discovery or not is considered [...] "irrelevant" [...] by historian Charles R. Boxer.

500|$|Arab {{tradition}} {{states that}} Saluq was an ancient town in Yemen {{not far from}} modern Ta'izz, and the Arabs associate this town with {{the origin of the}} breed. However, the word [...] "saluqi" [...] might have been derived from reference to several other places: Saluq in Armenia, and three towns called Saluqiyah. One has become modern Silifke (Turkey), another is near Antioch (modern Antakya, Turkey), and third is located near Baghdad (Iraq). Baghdad eclipsed Ctesiphon, the capital of the Persian Empire, which was located some 30 km (19 mi) to the southeast. Ctesiphon itself had replaced and absorbed Seleucia, the first capital of the Seleucid Empire (312 BC - 65 AD) and the adjective saluqi may have been derived by the Arabs of the Arabian Peninsula from the similar-sounding word for Seleucid used in the Aramaic and Syriac languages spoken there by the various peoples of that part of Mesopotamia, but there is no <b>irrefutable</b> evidence.|$|E

He {{spent most of his}} time building furniture for his apartment and bookshelves for the bookstore Shakespeare and Company, and in 1921 the volume Poems 1918–1921 was published. In 1922 Eliot sent him the manuscript of The Waste Land, then arrived in Paris to edit it with Pound, who blue-inked the manuscript with comments like [...] "make up yr. mind..." [...] and [...] "georgian". Eliot wrote: [...] "I should like to think that the manuscript, with the suppressed passages, had disappeared irrecoverably; yet, on the other hand, I should wish the blue pencilling on it to be preserved as <b>irrefutable</b> evidence of Pound's critical genius." ...|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the first}} book of The Satanic Bible is taken from parts of Redbeard's Might Is Right, edited to remove the racism, anti-Semitism, and {{misogyny}} present in the original version. It challenges both the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule, advocating instead a tooth-for-tooth philosophy. LaVey, through Redbeard, strongly advocates social Darwinism, saying, [...] "Death to the weakling, wealth to the strong!" [...] Humans are identified as instinctually predatory, and [...] "lust and carnal desire" [...] are singled out as part of humans' intrinsic nature. The Book of Satan suggests a hedonistic outlook, saying, [...] "I break away from all conventions that do not lead to my earthly happiness." [...] Indulgence is endorsed, and readers are encouraged {{to make the most}} of their lives. It criticizes both law and religious principles, instead suggesting doing only what makes one happy and successful. LaVey continues to denounce other religions, and he rails against what he considers to be arbitrary definitions of [...] "good" [...] and [...] "evil". Religion is criticized as a man-made construct, and the reader is urged to question everything and destroy any lies that he or she uncovers. Long-standing lies that are believed to be <b>irrefutable</b> truths are identified as the most dangerous. The last part of The Book of Satan is an adaptation of the Christian Beatitudes, changed to reflect the principles of LaVeyan Satanism.|$|E
500|$|A {{cross-border}} Selous Scouts raid into Mozambique on 9 August 1976 (dubbed [...] "the Nyadzonya Raid") killed over 1,000 {{people without}} Rhodesian fatalities, with Van der Byl {{insisting that the}} government had <b>irrefutable</b> proof that the raid had targeted a guerrilla training camp. He was unwilling to disclose the nature of the proof, though he invited the UN to conduct its own investigation into the raid. The raid produced a high body count and a major haul of intelligence and captured arms; according to ZANLA's own figures, which were not publicly circulated, most of those present in the camp had been armed guerrillas, though there were some civilians present. In a successful attempt to win global sympathy, ZANU clamoured that Nyadzonya had been full of unarmed refugees, leading most international opinion to condemn the Rhodesian raid as a massacre. Although cross-border raids into Mozambique had been approved by the Rhodesian cabinet, the depth and severity of the August incursion was greater than had been intended. Van der Byl had sanctioned the incursion largely on his own initiative. Although a tactical success, the incursion caused a final break with Zambia and Mozambique. The South African government was greatly displeased that its earlier diplomatic efforts were compromised and made this clear to Ian Smith. Smith appeared to consider this [...] "the final straw" [...] as far as Van der Byl's defence portfolio was concerned.|$|E
