25|$|To be sure, Estimé had hastened his own demise {{in several}} ways. His {{nationalization}} of the Standard <b>Fruit</b> <b>banana</b> concession sharply reduced the firm's revenues. He alienated workers by {{requiring them to}} invest between 10 percent and 15 percent of their salaries in national-defense bonds. The president sealed his fate by attempting to manipulate the constitution in order to extend his term in office. Seizing on this action and the popular unrest it engendered, the army forced the president to resign on 10 May 1950. The same junta that had assumed power {{after the fall of}} Lescot reinstalled itself. An army escort conducted Estimé from the National Palace and into exile in Jamaica. The events of May 1946 made an impression upon the deposed minister of labor, François Duvalier. The lesson that Duvalier drew from Estimé's ouster was that the military could not be trusted. It was a lesson that he would act upon when he gained power.|$|E

30|$|Under {{conditions}} of chilling stress, {{the rate of}} ethylene and CO 2 production usually increases [50 - 52]. Our results show that in fruit exposed to chilling, respiration declined 48 % with respect to control. While the production of ethylene showed a premature peak causing early and uneven ripening of the fruit. These disturbances in the metabolism of the fruit agree with previous reports [4, 53]. According to Jiang et al. [54], in fruits stored at low temperatures, chilling injuries are due to {{the reduction in the}} ability to respond to the ethylene signal, and it has an impact on an abnormal maturation of the <b>fruit.</b> <b>Banana</b> fruit exposed to chilling are perhaps less sensitive to ethylene causing abnormal maturation.
