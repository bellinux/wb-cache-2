500|$|The {{video was}} shot on March 12, 2010 in Los Angeles, {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. Mandler previously worked with Drake {{on the video}} for his collaboration with Mary J. Blige, [...] "The One". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake and I was really excited when he called me about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing what I think is an image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a <b>guy</b> <b>whose</b> lyrical presence does not equal his visual presence yet, by any means. That’s something that he and I spoke a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is so important in a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and I do all that, but I’m also somebody that’s asking, is that what I should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said that it was something that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. He came to me because he wanted to throw away the conventions of a medium, and take chances and be daring and take certain themes that are relevant to him and try to visualize them in not the obvious way".|$|E

500|$|Critics harshly {{criticized the}} film's {{controversial}} change in title from Rapunzel to Tangled. Holding Flynn's role and characterization partially responsible for it, they accused {{the character of}} being a marketing tool manipulated by Disney to attract larger male audiences via the film's trailers. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Dawn C. Chmielewski observed that Tangleds marketing campaign involved [...] "amp up {{the role of the}} dashing Errol Flynn-styled male lead to share the spotlight with the golden-haired namesake of the classic Brothers Grimm story". Tom Charity of CNN received Flynn as [...] "an attempt to lure boys and men into the theater". One of the film's trailers features Flynn [...] "trying to win over ... Rapunzel by giving her 'the smolder'" [...] while [...] "emphasiz ... action components ... over the more girl-oriented fairy tale stuff", according to Christian Blauvelt of Slant Magazine. Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail felt that Flynn was [...] "obviously designed to keep the young male audience from spurning yet another princess movie". Richard Corliss of Time mocked the film's marketing and the idea that [...] "The trailers suggest that the movie is an action comedy about a roguish <b>guy</b> ... <b>whose</b> mission is to storm the tower and free the girl inside." [...] Referring to the film's title as [...] "idiotic", Matt Neal of the Standard-Examiner wrote, [...] "Disney claims it changed the film's title from Rapunzel to Tangled to emphasise Flynn Rider's role in the film ... but that title-change excuse doesn't fly." [...] The Daily Mails Chris Tookey felt that Flynn's narration [...] "feels wrong", describing it [...] "as a commercially calculated move to reassure males in the audience that the film won't be too 'girly'." [...] Similarly, A. O. Scott of The New York Times received Flynn as a [...] "hijacking of a princess's tale", panning the character as [...] "a crude commercial calculation, a sign to the anxious boys in the audience that things aren't going to be too girly, or to Disneyphobes that the studio can bring some DreamWorks-style attitude." [...] Claire Martin of The Denver Post felt that Flynn's sole purpose in the film was for potential merchandising opportunities, specifically to [...] "take Ken's role as [...] male arm candy".|$|E
