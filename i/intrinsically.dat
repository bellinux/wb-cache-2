5|$|Rape is an <b>intrinsically</b> evil {{act that}} can cause grave damage to the victim for life.|$|E
5|$|Variable {{stars have}} {{periodic}} or random changes in luminosity because of intrinsic or extrinsic properties. Of the <b>intrinsically</b> variable stars, the primary types can be subdivided into three principal groups.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} (in Eucaryota ~33%) contain large unstructured but biologically functional segments and can {{be classified}} as <b>intrinsically</b> disordered proteins. Predicting and analysing protein disorder is, therefore, {{an important part of}} protein structure characterisation.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} regions, the locally dominant Fulani ethnic group is mostly Muslim, {{but the overall}} population is fairly evenly divided among Muslims, Christians, and followers of indigenous religious beliefs (called Kirdi ("pagan") by the Fulani). The Bamum ethnic group of the West Region is largely Muslim. Native traditional religions are practiced in rural areas throughout the country but rarely are practiced publicly in cities, in part because many indigenous religious groups are <b>intrinsically</b> local in character.|$|E
5|$|It {{is claimed}} that yoga {{can be an}} {{excellent}} training for children and adolescents, both {{as a form of}} physical exercise and for breathing, focus, mindfulness, and stress relief: many school districts have considered incorporating yoga into their P.E. programs. The Encinitas, California school district gained a San Diego Superior Court Judge's approval to use yoga in P.E., holding against the parents who claimed the practice was <b>intrinsically</b> religious and hence should not be part of a state funded program.|$|E
5|$|Some critics {{consider}} Balzac's writing exemplary of naturalism—a more pessimistic {{and analytical}} form of realism, {{which seeks to}} explain human behavior as <b>intrinsically</b> linked with the environment. French novelist Émile Zola declared Balzac {{the father of the}} naturalist novel. Zola indicated that whilst the Romantics saw the world through a colored lens, the naturalist sees through a clear glass—precisely the sort of effect Balzac attempted to achieve in his works.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{notably the}} Australian {{paralysis}} tick, are also <b>intrinsically</b> venomous {{and can cause}} tick paralysis. Eggs can become infected with pathogens inside a female tick's ovaries, {{in which case the}} larval ticks are infectious immediately at hatching, before feeding on their first host. Tropical bont ticks transmit the rickettsial disease heartwater which can be particularly devastating in cattle. The ticks carried by migratory birds may act as reservoirs and vectors of infectious diseases. Over twenty strains of pathogenic virus were found in the autumn in the Egyptian migratory bird study.|$|E
5|$|The boranes (boron {{hydrogen}} compounds) {{and similar}} gaseous compounds are quite poisonous. As usual, {{it is not}} an element that is <b>intrinsically</b> poisonous, but their toxicity depends on structure. The boranes are also highly flammable and require special care when handling. Sodium borohydride presents a fire hazard owing to its reducing nature and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid. Boron halides are corrosive.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrostatic}} force was first described in 1784 by Coulomb {{as a force}} that existed <b>intrinsically</b> between two charges. The properties of the {{electrostatic force}} were that it varied as an inverse square law directed in the radial direction, was both attractive and repulsive (there was intrinsic polarity), was independent {{of the mass of}} the charged objects, and followed the superposition principle. Coulomb's law unifies all these observations into one succinct statement.|$|E
5|$|The orbital semimajor axis is only 0.13 AU, {{around a}} third of the average {{distance}} between Mercury and the Sun, and is more eccentric than the orbit of any of the major planets of our solar system. Despite this, it is located in the inner regions of the system's habitable zone, since Gliese 876 is such an <b>intrinsically</b> faint star.|$|E
5|$|A few {{theoretical}} physicists {{have argued}} that classical physics is <b>intrinsically</b> incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of consciousness, but that quantum theory may provide the missing ingredients. Several theorists have therefore proposed quantum mind (QM) theories of consciousness. Notable theories falling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of Karl Pribram and David Bohm, and the Orch-OR theory formulated by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose. Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness, as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness. None of the quantum mechanical theories has been confirmed by experiment. Recent publications by G. Guerreshi, J. Cia, S. Popescu, and H. Briegel could falsify proposals {{such as those of}} Hameroff, which rely on quantum entanglement in protein. At the present time many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing.|$|E
5|$|Although most proteasomal {{substrates}} must be ubiquitinated {{before being}} degraded, {{there are some}} exceptions to this general rule, especially when the proteasome plays a normal role in the post-translational processing of the protein. The proteasomal activation of NF-κB by processing p105 into p50 via internal proteolysis is one major example. Some proteins that are hypothesized to be unstable due to <b>intrinsically</b> unstructured regions, are degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner. The most well-known example of a ubiquitin-independent proteasome substrate is the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase. Ubiquitin-independent mechanisms targeting key cell cycle regulators such as p53 have also been reported, although p53 is also subject to ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Finally, structurally abnormal, misfolded, or highly oxidized proteins are also subject to ubiquitin-independent and 19S-independent degradation under conditions of cellular stress.|$|E
5|$|At the morgue, Scully {{explains}} that {{she studied the}} bite wounds and discovered that they are similar, but <b>intrinsically</b> different, than human bites; the saliva on the regurgitated fingers has anti-coagulants in it, which only bats have in their saliva. Doggett finds the evidence interesting, due to the newspaper article he brought Scully: in 1956, a series of deaths was reported that ended {{when a group of}} hunters killed a man-bat creature and brought it to the county morgue in part of Montana. The coroner said the creature was neither bat nor man. Then the coroner was killed a few days later and soon after a few more people were killed or disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of proteins' conformation or configuration space (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds, before 2010 simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales. General-purpose supercomputers have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are <b>intrinsically</b> costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong scaling of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult. Moreover, as protein folding is a stochastic process and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{there is}} no attempt by the artist to soften the subject's {{brutality}} through technical skill. Method and subject are indivisible. Goya's procedure is determined less by the mandates of traditional virtuosity than by his <b>intrinsically</b> morbid theme. The brushwork could not be described as pleasing, and the colors are restricted to earth tones and black, punctuated by bright flashes of white and the red blood of the victims. The quality of the pigment itself foreshadows Goya's later works: a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish. Few would admire the work for painterly flourishes, such is its horrific force and its lack of theatricality.|$|E
5|$|Four {{nonmetals}} are {{distinguished by}} polyatomic bonding in their standard states, in either discrete or extended molecular forms: carbon (C, as graphite sheets); phosphorus (as P4 molecules); sulfur (as S8 molecules); and selenium (Se, as helical chains). Consistent with their higher coordination numbers (2 or 3), the polyatomic nonmetals show more metallic character than the neighbouring diatomic nonmetals; {{they are all}} solid, mostly semi-lustrous semiconductors with electronegativity values that are intermediate to moderately high (2.19–2.58). Sulfur is the least metallic of the polyatomic nonmetals given its dull appearance, brittle comportment, and low conductivity—attributes common to all sulfur allotropes. It nevertheless shows some metallic character, either <b>intrinsically</b> or in its compounds with other nonmetals. Examples include the malleability of plastic sulfur and the lustrous-bronze appearance and metallic conductivity of polysulfur nitride (SNx).|$|E
5|$|In 1884 the DF renamed {{itself the}} Social Democratic Federation (SDF) and {{underwent}} an internal reorganisation. However, {{the group was}} facing an internal schism between those (such as Hyndman), who argued for a parliamentary path toward socialism, and those (like Morris) who deemed the Houses of Parliament <b>intrinsically</b> corrupt and capitalist. Personal issues between Morris and Hyndman were exacerbated by their attitude to British foreign policy; Morris was staunchly anti-imperialist while Hyndman expressed patriotic sentiment encouraging some foreign intervention. The division {{between the two groups}} developed into open conflict, with the majority of activists sharing Morris' position. In December 1884 Morris and his supporters – most notably Ernest Belfort Bax and Edward Aveling – left the SDF; the first major schism of the British socialist movement.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{eventually}} {{resumed his}} naval career, first {{as an assistant}} to the Director of Naval Intelligence and then, in August 1906, as Flag-captain to Rear-Admiral George Egerton on HMS Victorious. He had by this time become a national hero, despite his aversion to the limelight, and the expedition was being presented to the public as a triumph. This euphoria was not conducive to objective analysis, or to thoughtful appraisal of the expedition's strengths and weaknesses. In particular, the glorification by Scott of man-hauling as something <b>intrinsically</b> more noble than other ice travel techniques led to a general distrust of methods involving ski and dogs, a mindset that was carried forward into later expeditions. This mystified seasoned ice travellers such as Fridtjof Nansen, whose advice on such matters was usually sought, but often set aside.|$|E
5|$|Sedna has a V-band {{absolute}} magnitude (H) of about 1.8, {{and it is}} estimated to have an albedo of about 0.32, thus giving it a diameter of approximately 1,000km. At {{the time of its}} discovery it was the <b>intrinsically</b> brightest object found in the Solar System since Pluto in 1930. In 2004, the discoverers placed an upper limit of 1,800km on its diameter, but by 2007 this was revised downward to less than 1,600km after observation by the Spitzer Space Telescope. In 2012, measurements from the Herschel Space Observatory suggested that Sedna's diameter was , which would make it smaller than Pluto's moon Charon. Because Sedna has no known moons, determining its mass is currently impossible without sending a space probe. Sedna is currently the largest trans-Neptunian Sun-orbiting object not known to possess a satellite.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{world was}} {{populated}} {{by a great}} variety of deities, supernatural entities and sacred forces. The Maya had such a broad interpretation of what was sacred that identifying distinct deities with specific functions is inaccurate. The Maya interpretation of deities was <b>intrinsically</b> tied to the calendar, astronomy, and their cosmovision. The importance of a deity, its characteristics, and its associations varied according to the movement of celestial bodies. The priestly interpretation of astronomical records and books was therefore crucial, since the priest would understand which deity required ritual propitiation, when the correct ceremonies should be performed, and what would be an appropriate offering. Each deity had four manifestations, associated with the cardinal directions, each identified with a different colour. They also had a dual day-night/life-death aspect.|$|E
5|$|The Skylon design {{features}} several distinct differences {{when compared with}} the earlier HOTOL programme. Whereas HOTOL would have launched from a rocket sled as a weight-saving measure, Skylon is to be equipped with conventional retractable undercarriage. The revised engine design, using the SABRE engine, is expected to offer higher performance than its predecessor. The rear mounted engine of HOTOL meant that the vehicle possessed <b>intrinsically</b> poor in-flight stability; early attempts to resolve this problem had ended up sacrificing much of HOTOL's payload potential, which in turn contributed to the failure of the overall project. Skylon's solution to the issue was to position its engines {{at the end of its}} wings, which located them further forward and much closer to the vehicle's longitudinal centre of mass, thereby resolving the instability problem.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} the {{existence}} of an actual infinity was an important shared concern within the realms of mathematics, philosophy and religion. Preserving the orthodoxy of the relationship between God and mathematics, although not in the same form as held by his critics, was long a concern of Cantor's. He directly addressed this intersection between these disciplines in the introduction to his Grundlagen einer allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre, where he stressed the connection between his view of the infinite and the philosophical one. To Cantor, his mathematical views were <b>intrinsically</b> linked to their philosophical and theological implications – he identified the Absolute Infinite with God, and he considered his work on transfinite numbers to have been directly communicated to him by God, who had chosen Cantor to reveal them to the world.|$|E
5|$|The free {{element is}} {{remarkable}} for its robustness, especially {{the fact that}} it has the highest melting point of all the elements discovered, melting at 3422°C (6192°F, 3695K). It also has the second highest boiling point, at 5930°C (10706°F, 6203K). Its density is 19.3 times that of water, comparable to that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead. Polycrystalline tungsten is an <b>intrinsically</b> brittle and hard material (under standard conditions, when uncombined), making it difficult to work. However, pure single-crystalline tungsten is more ductile, and can be cut with a hard-steel hacksaw.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} of hadrosaurid eye sockets and the {{presence}} of sclerotic rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. The hadrosaurid sense of hearing also appears to be strong. There is at least one example, in the related Corythosaurus, of a slender stapes (reptilian ear bone) in place, which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear, and the hadrosaurid lagena is elongate like a crocodilian's. This indicates that the auditory portion of the inner ear was well-developed. If used as a noisemaker, the crest could also have provided recognizable differences for different species or sexes, because the differing layouts of the nasal passages corresponding to the different crest shapes would have produced <b>intrinsically</b> different sounds.|$|E
5|$|The CCP {{views the}} world as {{organized}} into two opposing camps; socialist and capitalist. They insist that socialism, {{on the basis of}} historical materialism, will eventually triumph over capitalism. In recent years, when the party has been asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring, the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Despite admitting that globalization developed through the capitalist system, the party's leaders and theorist argue that globalization is not <b>intrinsically</b> capitalist. The reason being that if globalization was purely capitalist, it would exclude an alternative socialist form of modernity. Globalization, as with the market economy, therefore does not have one specific class character (neither socialist nor capitalist) according to the party. The insistence that globalization is not fixed in nature comes from Deng's insistence that China can pursue socialist modernization by incorporating elements of capitalism. Because of this there is considerable optimism within the CCP that despite the current capitalist dominance of globalization, globalization can be turned into a vehicle supporting socialism.|$|E
5|$|The Maya calendrical system, {{in common}} with other Mesoamerican calendars, had its origins in the Preclassic period. However, it was the Maya that {{developed}} the calendar to its maximum sophistication, recording lunar and solar cycles, eclipses and movements of planets with great accuracy. In some cases, the Maya calculations were more accurate than equivalent calculations in the Old World; for example, the Maya solar year was calculated to greater accuracy than the Julian year. The Maya calendar was <b>intrinsically</b> tied to Maya ritual, and it was central to Maya religious practices. The calendar combined a non-repeating Long Count with three interlocking cycles, each measuring a progressively larger period. These were the 260-day tzolk'in, the 365-day haab', and the 52-year Calendar Round, resulting from {{the combination of the}} tzolk'in with the haab. There were also additional calendric cycles, such as an 819-day cycle associated with the four quadrants of Maya cosmology, governed by four different aspects of the god K'awiil.|$|E
5|$|The {{plaintiff}} in Lines International {{argued that the}} guidelines adopted by the multi-agency committee {{set up by the}} PSA, STPB and GSB were invalid as the committee had no existence at law. The High Court held that there was nothing unlawful or even <b>intrinsically</b> wrong with these government agencies setting up such a committee to discuss matters of relevance to their respective jurisdictions as long as each agency made its own decisions within the ambit of its own statutory powers. The notion that such a committee fettered PSA's discretion was dismissed by a further finding of fact that the ad-hoc committee had not acted as an entity in itself. Enforcement and appropriate action were left to the agencies. A meeting attended by the plaintiff's representatives at which the guidelines relating to cruises-to-nowhere were announced was facilitated by a moderator rather than a chairperson, and each of the agencies read out guidelines which they themselves would be adopting and implementing.|$|E

25|$|Promoting {{intrinsic}} motivation {{and problem solving}} are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative {{when they see a}} task as <b>intrinsically</b> motivating, valued for its own sake.

Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more <b>intrinsically</b> motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.|$|E
