40|$|This work {{presents}} the construction solution and experimental {{results of a}} novel desorber for online drilling mud <b>gas</b> <b>logging.</b> The traditional desorbers use mechanical mixing of the liquid to stimulate transfer of hydrocarbons to the gaseous phase that is further analyzed. The presented approach is based on transfer of hydrocarbons from the liquid to the gas bubbles flowing through it and further gas analysis. The desorber was checked for <b>gas</b> <b>logging</b> from four different drilling muds collected from Polish boreholes. The results of optimization studies are also presented in this study. The comparison of the novel desorber with a commercial one reveals strong advantages of the novel one. It is characterized by much better hydrocarbons recovery efficiency and allows reaching lower limits of detection of the whole analytical system.

The AGN activity is well correlated with existence of the gas systems. None of galaxies without the gas systems show the AGN activity.

However, although the structure of the Fe line appears broad, there is tentative evidence that it may comprise multiple lines. Nevertheless, previous analyses have only consisted of fitting standalone broad components to the Fe K band. Here, we have analyzed all available X-ray CCD data from Suzaku, XMM-Newton and ASCA to fully investigate the nature of the emission complex by testing broad-band physical models and alternative hypotheses. We find that both a model consisting of broad, blurred reflection from an ionized accretion disc and a model consisting of cold, neutral reflection plus narrow emission lines from highly-ionized photoionized <b>gas</b> (<b>log</b> ξ = 3. 5) offer statistically comparable fits to the data although the true reality of the Fe line cannot currently be determined with existing data.

40|$|We {{report on}} XMM-Newton spectroscopic {{observations}} of the luminous radio-quiet quasar PDS 456. The hard X-ray spectrum of PDS 456 shows a deep absorption trough (constituting 50 % of the continuum) at energies above 7 keV in the quasar rest frame, which {{can be attributed to}} a series of blueshifted K-shell absorption edges due to highly ionized iron. The higher resolution soft X-ray Reflection Grating Spectrometer spectrum exhibits a broad absorption line feature near 1 keV, which can be modeled by a blend of L-shell transitions from highly ionized iron (Fe XVII-Fe XXIV). An extreme outflow velocity of ~ 50, 000 km s- 1 is required to model the K- and L-shell iron absorption present in the XMM-Newton data. Overall, a large column density (NH = 5 × 1023 cm- 2) of highly ionized <b>gas</b> (<b>log</b> ξ = 2. 5) is required in PDS 456. A high-mass outflow rate of ~ 10 M☉ yr- 1 (assuming a conservative outflow covering factor of 0. 1 sr) is derived, which is of the same order as the overall mass accretion rate in PDS 456. The kinetic energy of the outflow represents a substantial fraction (~ 10 %) of the quasar energy budget, while the large column and outflow velocity place PDS 456 toward the extreme end of the broad absorption line quasar population...|$|E
40|$|There {{are over}} 7 million {{gas-fired}} fireplaces currently installed in US households. On an annual basis, these use substantial energy. However, {{the details of}} the fireplace energy use and the factors that influence it are currently not well understood. Fireplaces are a type of hearth product, which is a product category that primarily consists of fireplaces, stoves, and <b>gas</b> <b>log</b> sets. For the purpose of this study, the fuels used in hearth products are primarily natural gas, propane, or electricity. They may be vented or unvented. This study reports the results of a web survey of 2, 100 respondents in the United States performed in February 2016. The responses were cleaned and weighted using the raking method to form a nationally representative population. The reported data include hearth product characteristics, usage information, and repair and maintenance practices. The hearth product characteristics include the hearth product type, fuel type, ignition system type, features, venting, and installation details. The usage information includes seasonal usage of the main burner and standing pilot (if present), daily usage, and the primary utility (whether decorative or for heating). These raw data are further processed and combined with values from the literature to estimate the annual operating hours and energy use and to assess how these are impacted by the hearth product type, features, age, and the main heating appliance, if present. Based on the survey responses, the estimated average annual hours of usage was 234 for the main burner, and 4, 593 for the standing pilot. The results presented provide the most comprehensive data regarding hearth products in the United States published to date. These new data allow for an improved understanding of hearth products’ energy use, which in turn may facilitate the development of more informed analyses, and ultimately more efficient hearth products and reduced energy use. These new data also provide insight into topics not previously studied, such as the effect of hearth product features on energy use...|$|E

The project was designed to determine the relative energy efficiency of typical new home construction, energy efficiency retrofitting of existing homes, and high -performance new homes built {{from the ground up}} for energy efficiency. This project will compare three houses that represented the current construction practice as a base case (Builder House CC 1); a modified house that could represent a major energy- efficient retrofit (Retrofit House CC 2); and a house constructed from the ground up to be a high- performance home (High Performance House CC 3). In order tTo enablehave a valid comparison, it was necessary to simulate occupancy in all three houses and heavily monitor the structural components and the energy usage by component. All three houses are two story, slab on grade, framed construction. CC 1 and CC 2 are approximately 2, 400 square feet 2. CC 3 has a pantry option, that is primarily used as a mechanical equipment room, that adds approximately 100 square feet 2. All three houses are all-electric (with the exception of a <b>gas</b> <b>log</b> fireplace that is not used during the testing), and use air-source heat pumps for heating and cooling. The three homes are located in Knoxville in the Campbell Creek Subdivision. CC 1 and CC 2 are next door to each other and CC 3 is across the street and a couple of houses down. The energy data collected will be used to determine the benefits of retrofit packages and high -performance new home packages. There are over 300 channels of continuous energy performance and thermal comfort data collection in the houses (100 for each house). The data will also be used to evaluate the impact of energy -efficient upgrades ton the envelope, mechanical equipment, or demand -response options.

40|$|AbstractCompared with {{conventional}} gas reservoirs, shale gas reservoirs are not sensitive to petrophysical properties, making it much {{difficult to identify}} this kind of reservoirs with well logging technologies. Therefore, through {{a comparison of the}} logging curves of the Lower Silurian Longmaxi marine shale in the Jiaoshiba area, Sichuan Basin, it is found that the mud shale on conventional log curves generally features high gamma ray, high uranium, low thorium, low kalium, relative high resistivity, high interval transit time, low neutron, low density and low photoelectric absorption cross section index, while on elements logging curves, it features an increase of silicon content and a decrease of aluminum and iron content. Based on the logging response characteristics of mud shale, the logging curves most sensitive to shale, gamma ray, neutron and density logging were selected and overlaid to identify mud shale effectively. On the basis of qualitative identification, the density logging value can identify the non-organic-rich mud shale from organic-rich mud shale, because the former has a density of 2. 61 – 2. 70  g/cm 3, while the latter has a density of less than 2. 61  g/cm 3.

40|$|The damages of {{different}} drilling modes to reservoirs {{are different in}} types and degrees. In this paper, the geologic characteristics and types of such damages were analyzed. Then, based {{on the relationship between}} reservoir pressure and bottom hole flowing pressure corresponding to different drilling modes, the experimental procedures on reservoir damages in three drilling modes (e. g. gas drilling, liquid-based underbalanced drilling and overbalanced drilling) were designed. Finally, damage simulation experiments were conducted on the tight sandstone reservoir cores of the Jurassic Ahe Fm in the Tarim Basin and Triassic Xujiahe Fm in the central Sichuan Basin. It is shown that the underbalanced drilling is beneficial to reservoir protection because of its less damage on reservoir permeability, but it is, to some extent, sensitive to the stress and the empirical formula of stress sensitivity coefficient is obtained; and that the overbalanced drilling has more reservoir damages due to the invasion of solid and liquid phases. After the water saturation of cores rises to the irreducible water saturation, the decline of <b>gas</b> <b>logging</b> permeability speeds up and the damage degree of water lock increases. It is concluded that the laboratory experiment results of reservoir damage are accordant with the reservoir damage characteristics in actual drilling conditions.

The petrophysical logs are used in both subsurface modelling and to optimise the well completion strategy, ensuring effective coal dewatering and desorption for gas production. At the moment, the industry common practice for data acquisition is to use open-hole wireline logging tools, which were developed primarily for {{the oil and gas}} industry. These tools are designed for higher pressure and temperature specifications compared to the reservoir conditions normally seen in coalbed methane (CBM), commonly called coal seam gas (CSG) in Australia. This results in heavier tools, larger logging trucks and increased manpower requirements than seen in mining logging operations. Arrow 2 ̆ 7 s CBM development projects in Queensland, Australia, are designed with a large number of wells (more than ∼ 1000 wells) that will need to be drilled and evaluated over the next ten years.
