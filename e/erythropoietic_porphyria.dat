5|$|Discoloration {{of teeth}} {{may result from}} {{bacteria}} stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods {{with an abundance of}} chlorophyll, restorative materials, and medications. Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of chlorhexidine, a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. Congenital <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>porphyria</b> causes porphyrins to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with alkaptonuria and rarely with Parkinson's disease. Erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary atresia are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous leprosy. Some medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.|$|E

40|$|The inborn {{errors of}} heme biosynthesis, the porphyrias, are 8 genetically {{distinct}} metabolic disorders {{that can be}} classified as “acute hepatic, ” “hepatic cutaneous, ” and “erythropoietic cutaneous ” diseases. Recent advances in understanding their pathogenesis and molecular genetic heterogeneity have led to improved diagnosis and treatment. These advances include DNA-based diagnoses for all the porphyrias, new understanding of the pathogenesis of the acute hepatic porphyrias, identification of the iron overload-induced inhibitor of hepatic uroporphyrin decarboxylase activity that causes the most common porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, the identification of an X-linked form of erythropoietic protoporphyria due to gain-of-function mutations in erythroid-specific 5 -aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS 2), and new and experimental treatments for the erythropoietic prophyrias. Knowledge of these advances is relevant for hematologists because they administer the hematin infusions to treat the acute attacks in patients with the acute hepatic porphyrias, perform the chronic phlebotomies to reduce the iron overload and clear the dermatologic lesions in porphyria cutanea tarda, and diagnose and treat the <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>porphyrias,</b> including chronic erythrocyte transfusions, bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplants, and experimental pharmacologic chaperone and stem cell gene therapies for congenital erythropoietic protoporphyria. These developments are reviewed to update hematologists on the latest advances in these diverse disorders...|$|R
25|$|The non-acute porphyrias are X-linked {{dominant}} protoporphyria (XLDPP), congenital <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>porphyria</b> (CEP), {{porphyria cutanea tarda}} (PCT), and {{erythropoietic protoporphyria}} (EPP). None of these are associated with acute attacks; their primary manifestation is with skin disease. For this reason, these four porphyrias—along with two acute porphyrias, VP and HCP, that may also involve skin manifestations—are sometimes called cutaneous porphyrias.|$|E
25|$|The rarest is {{congenital}} <b>erythropoietic</b> <b>porphyria</b> (C.E.P.), {{otherwise known}} as Gunther's disease.

25|$|The organs mainly {{involved}} in heme synthesis are the liver (in which {{the rate of}} synthesis is highly variable, depending on the systemic heme pool) and the bone marrow (in which rate of synthesis of Heme is relatively constant and depends on the production of globin chain), although every cell requires heme to function properly. However, due to its toxic properties, proteins such as Hemopexin (Hx) are required to help maintain physiological stores of iron {{in order for them}} to be used in synthesis. Heme is seen as an intermediate molecule in catabolism of hemoglobin in the process of bilirubin metabolism. Defects in various enzymes in synthesis of heme can lead to group of disorder called porphyrias, these include acute intermittent porphyria, congenital erythropoetic porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, hereditary coproporphyria, variegate <b>porphyria,</b> <b>erythropoietic</b> protoporphyria.|$|R
40|$|Irradiation of the forearms of two {{patients}} with erythropoietic protoporphyria and one patient with {{porphyria cutanea tarda}} resulted in an in vivo activation of the complement system, as assessed by diminution of the hemolytic titers of the third component of complement by 23 - 57 %, and of the fifth component of complement (C 5) by 19 - 47 %. Such treatment also generated chemotactic activity for human polymorphonuclear cells; the chemotactic activity was stable at 56 degrees C and antigenically related to human C 5. On Sephadex G- 75 chromatography the chemotactic activity eluted with an apparent molecular weight of 15, 000. These in vivo results extend our previous in vitro observation of photoactivation of complement in sera from patients with <b>erythropoietic</b> protoporphyria and <b>porphyria</b> cutanea tarda, and suggest that the complement system may participate in the pathogenesis of cutaneous phototoxicity in these patients...|$|R
40|$|This is an {{overview}} of the cutaneous porphyrias. It is a narrative review based on the published literature and my personal experience; it is not based on a formal systematic search of the literature. The cutaneous porphyrias are a diverse group of conditions due to inherited or acquired enzyme defects in the porphyrin–haem biosynthetic pathway. All the cutaneous porphyrias can have (either {{as a consequence of the}} porphyria or as part of the cause of the porphyria) involvement of other organs as well as the skin. The single commonest cutaneous porphyria in most parts of the world is acquired porphyria cutanea tarda, which is usually due to chronic liver disease and liver iron overload. The next most common cutaneous <b>porphyria,</b> <b>erythropoietic</b> protoporphyria, is an inherited disorder in which the accumulation of bile-excreted protoporphyrin can cause gallstones and, rarely, liver disease. Some of the porphyrias that cause blistering (usually bullae) and fragility (clinically and histologically identical to porphyria cutanea tarda) can also be associated with acute neurovisceral porphyria attacks, particularly variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria. Management of porphyria cutanea tarda mainly consists of visible-light photoprotection measures while awaiting the effects of treating the underlying liver disease (if possible) and treatments to reduce serum iron and porphyrin levels. In erythropoietic protoporphyria, the underlying cause can be resolved only with a bone marrow transplant (which is rarely justifiable in this condition), so management consists particularly of visible-light photoprotection and, in some countries, narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy. Afamelanotide is a promising and newly available treatment for erythropoietic protoporphyria and has been approved in Europe since 2014...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} the mechanisms {{responsible for the}} distinct cutaneous manifestations of <b>erythropoietic</b> protoporphyria and <b>porphyria</b> cutanca tarda, the effects of protoporphyrin (PP) and uroporphyrin (URO), the predominant porphyrins in the respective disease, on mast cells were examined. Release of preformed and generated mediators was assessed by the release of radioactivity from cells labeled with [3 H]-serotonin and [14 C]arachidonic acid, respectively. Clinically relevant doses of PP (25 – 50 () ng/ml) and 396 – 407 urn irradiation (3 – 16 × 102 J/m 2) induced maximal net release of preformed mediators of 44. 52 ± 6. 6 to 58. 01 ± 4. 0 % (mean ± SE). In contrast, irradiation {{in the presence of}} URO (50 – 5000 ng/mI) resulted in < 5 % net release. [3 H]Serotonin release induced by PP and irradiation was calcium-independent, and was not enhanced by phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate, a known activator of protein kinase C. This release was suppressed by catalase, a scavenger of hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, irradiation in the presence of PP. but not in the presence of URO, resulted in perturbation of cell membrane. Irradiation in the presence of PP also resulted in a maximal net release of generated mediators of 9. 98 ± 3. 5 % (mean ± SE), whereas similar treatment in the presence of URO induced < 0. 5 % net release. These results suggested that the burning, stinging, erythema, and edema experienced by patients with crythropoietic protoporphyria following sun exposure, and the lack of such findings in patients with porphyria cutanea tarda, may be explained, at least in part, by the differential effects of PP and URO on mast cells...|$|R
