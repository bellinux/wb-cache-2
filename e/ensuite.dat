Il ne s’agissait pas d’un poids exagéré. C’est une simple défaillance mécanique.This translates loosely to the following:We {{had taken}} off after taxiing for three minutes. At once, I noted that the plane started to pitch. The effort of the pilot to right the plane remained vain. At {{this point in time}} the stewardess told me to put on my seat belt.

500|$|In July 2013 the University {{requested}} Nicholas Hare Architects {{to assess}} the site's suitability for a student housing development, resulting in proposals to build accommodation incorporating 393 en-suite student bed spaces. Planning consultants Luken Beck conducted a planning appraisal in 2015. The University put the site up for sale on a long leasehold basis in 2015, with the sales literature describing the property as a [...] "large, underdeveloped site extending to 6.37 acres (2.58 hectares) in a highly attractive landscaped setting" [...] and featuring an image depicting new blocks of student accommodation {{in place of the}} tower and {{on the opposite side of}} the original house.

500|$|The palace {{consists}} {{of a total of}} 150 rooms, the principal of which are panelled with wood block floors. Inside the corps de logis, it had been Blore's intention to follow the English 19th century tradition of distinct masculine and feminine suites of reception rooms; with a library, dining rooms and billiard room <b>ensuite</b> to left of the central hall for men, and a massive drawing room to the right for women. This layout of gender designated zones had become popular in Victorian England; however its intention was not to segregate the sexes, but more to define furnishings – the male zones tended to have heavy oak furniture and dark 'Turkey' carpets, whereas the female zones would have more delicate furnishings of rosewood, Aubusson carpets and chintz soft furnishings. However, for unknown reasons, this [...] concept was never executed and the female part of the house was extended into the male territory, with the intended billiard room becoming the countess's boudoir while the study became a further small sitting room for feminine use. Above these seaward facing rooms were the family bedrooms.|$|E
500|$|Besides the hotel, Lum Chang Holdings also leased out the {{building}} to several tenants who operated shops and other businesses. The L-shaped ground floor was partitioned for 8 of these shops. People commonly referred to the entire Nam Tin building as the Great Southern Hotel when the hotel subsequently became very popular. The Nam Tin Building became a major shopping hub for customers who found it fashionable to patronise {{the building}}'s shops, outlets and cabarets. Chinese operas used to be staged at the building as an occasional attraction. The Southern Cabaret, based in the Diamond Dragon Dance Palace on the fifth floor, was of particular extravagance, as this article in The Straits Times describes it: [...] "Dragon pillars studded with cut glass… constructed {{under the supervision of}} Miss Leong Sai Chan, former Shanghai movie star, the cabaret is an imitation of China's famed Peking palace. Beautifully coloured carvings of birds and animals of Chinese mythology decorate the walls of cabaret." [...] Operated by the Cantonese, the Great Southern Hotel catered more to Chinese travellers, including celebrities from Hong Kong and China. This was unlike the upmarket hotels like Raffles Hotel, Goodwood Park Hotel and Adelphi Hotel which then accommodated mainly Europeans and English-speaking visitors. As a boutique hotel with shops and entertainment outlets for rich Chinese immigrants, the Great Southern Hotel was considered as the [...] "Raffles Hotel of Chinatown". Each room had its own <b>ensuite</b> shower and toilet, and was given a roomy feeling by the 4m high ceiling and cast iron casement windows. The latter let in far more light than the wooden windows commonly found on shophouses in the-now Kreta Ayer Conservation Area, which were largely in the Transitional and Art Deco styles.|$|E
