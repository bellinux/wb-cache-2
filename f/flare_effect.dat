40|$|Abstract. Of {{the many}} episodic {{variations}} {{associated with the}} active Sun, perhaps the solar flare is the most spectacular and enigmatic. Because flares emit photons that reach our atmosphere in about 8 minutes, with no intervening heliospheric or magneto spheric interactions, <b>flare</b> <b>effects</b> upon the geospace system have been a somewhat neglected component in Space Weather research. Once flare photons pass the Earth, the orbit of Mars is reached in just 4 additional minutes. Recent analyses of new ionospheric data at Mars revealed electron density enhancements due to flares. On the same days, ionospheric monitoring stations on Earth equipped with University of Lowell ionosondes also recorded ionospheric <b>flare</b> <b>effects.</b> In this paper, we present observations to characterize how flares modify the ionospheres of both planets, and describe {{how they can be}} used as comparative experiments to explore how photochemical, dynamical and electro-dynamical processes operate in solar-planetary-systems...|$|R

50|$|By {{citing the}} {{previous}} research of Edward Sabine, which established {{a correlation between}} sunspots and magnetic storms, Stewart was able to correctly advance {{the theory that the}} event observed by Richard Carrington and the magnetic disturbance that was recorded at the same time were in fact connected. The magnetic phenomena that occurred at about 11:18 GMT on 1 September 1859 are now known as a Solar <b>Flare</b> <b>Effect</b> (SFE) or a Magnetic Crochet, but the connection would not be proven for another 80 years. The SFE is a sudden ionosphere disturbances caused by soft X-rays and Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) driven enhancement of the ionosphere current vortices responsible for the regular daily variation observed on magnetometer traces. SFE are mostly observed in locations close to the sub-solar point (i.e. the point on earth when the sun is overhead) and can only be observed from stations in the sunlit hemisphere {{at the time of the}} solar flare. Using Stewart’s times, the magnetic storm associated with the Carrington Super Flare took 17 hours and 45 minutes to reach the Earth.|$|E
50|$|In {{the time}} zone at GMT+7 {{it would have}} been 15 minutes to high noon on 28 August. Any {{observatory}} situated at plus or minus two time zones would have been in an excellent position to observe the super flare and record the magnetic signature of Solar <b>Flare</b> <b>Effect.</b> Unfortunately in 1859 the Kew Observatory had the only self-recording magnetographs. Other magnetic observatories were manually operated and typically only took readings at hourly intervals unless there was a magnetic storm, in which case readings were taken at 15 minute intervals. One such magnetic observatory was the Colaba Observatory on the Island of Colaba which is now part of Mumbai (Bombay), India at GMT+5.5. In a 2003 paper the manually recorded magnetic readings from the Colaba Observatory for 1 September, through 2 September 1859 were recalibrated and evaluated. No mention is made in this paper of reading before 1 September or any visual observations of the sun. After 150 years it is very unlikely that any additional data will surface but any reports of strange events about noon Asian time on 28 August 1859 would be of interest.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} we {{describe}} and compare photometric and resistivity measurement methodologies to determine solute concentrations in porous media flow tank experiments. The first method is the photometric method, which directly relates digitally measured intensities of a tracer dye to concentrations without previously converting the intensities to optical densities. This enables an effective processing of {{a large amount of}} images to compute concentration time series at various points of the flow tank. Perturbations of the measurements are investigated and both lens <b>flare</b> <b>effects</b> and the image resolution {{turned out to be the}} major sources of error. An attached mask is able to minimize the lens <b>flare</b> <b>effects.</b> The second method for in situ measurement of salt concentrations in porous media experiments is the resistivity method. The resistivity measurement system uses two different input voltages at gilded electrode sticks to enable the measurement of salt concentrations from 0 to 300 g/l. Power laws are used to relate apparent resistivity values and salt concentrations. However, due to the unknown measurement volume of the electrodes, we consider the image analysis method more appropriate for intermediate scale laboratory benchmark experiments to evaluate numerical codes...|$|R
5000|$|The PlayStation {{was chosen}} as the lead {{platform}} because lead programmer Simon Tick strongly felt that it was the most powerful format of the time. In particular, he reasoned that the Saturn and PC versions would come out better if the programmers were trying to emulate impressive graphical effects on an extant PlayStation version than if they were designing the game around the hardware limitations of the Saturn. Tick elaborated on how the team intended to optimize the game for Saturn: [...] At the moment on PlayStation, we've got six or seven circular images which appear to make the lens <b>flare</b> <b>effect,</b> but maybe we'll just have two or three on Saturn version to keep the frame rate up. ... Frame rate is the main thing. We've got one guy coming over to us from Sega who's very clever. He's written a program which basically takes a polygonal model, and as it's rendering it looks at the size of the polygons; if they're very small it says [...] "there's no point texturing this, let's do it flat in just one color," [...] and this way it saves processor time and helps keep the frame rate up. We're going to reduce the detail of the models quite a lot, and reduce the texturing so the roads on Saturn will probably be flat shaded - so it's like a gray road rather than having textures.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{driver of}} the Sq current is the {{external}} (1, -2) tidal wave mode. Due to its constant phase with altitude, is most efficient to drive coherent winds at dynamo layer height, while the currents generated by the internal modes interfere destructively at various heights. A Fourier analysis shows a semidiurnal component with an amplitude of 1 /2 of that of the diurnal component, phase shifted by 180°. This {{appears to be the}} result of nonlinear coupling between the product of the diurnally varying wind and the diurnally varying conductivity [...] The centers of the daytime vortices show a day to day variability. This can be attributed to the internal tidal modes which are sensitive to the varying meteorological conditions in the lower and in the middle atmosphere, in part also to solar activity. [...] Near the dip equator (where the geomagnetic field lines are horizontal), a strong band of eastward flowing currents can be observed in a range of about 150 km from the equator. Such enhancement of the Sq current by a factor of about four is due to the Cowling conductivity. During a solar flare, bursts of solar radiation from the environment of an active sunspot reach the higher atmosphere, mainly at E- and D- layer heights, lasting at most for one hour. The electric conductivity increases, and the Sq current enhances on the daytime hemisphere. A small increase occurs, called geomagnetic solar <b>flare</b> <b>effect</b> or crochet. During a solar eclipse, the electric conductivity decreases in the shadow region, and the Sq current and thus the Sq variation diminishes by a few nT in that area. It is called a geomagnetic solar eclipse effect. Both events can be observed only during quiet geomagnetic activity. In the aftermath of strong magnetospheric disturbances, a current system develops into a quasi anti-Sq-current. It is generated by Joule heating in the polar thermosphere. This current system is called Ddyn.|$|E

A total of 41 solar flares, including 21 C-class, 19 M-class and 01 X-class, occurred during the daylight part of the NWC-Allahabad transmitter receiver great circle path. The local time dependence of solar <b>flare</b> <b>effect</b> on {{the change in the}} VLF amplitude (ΔA), time delay (Δt) between VLF peak amplitude and X-ray flux peak have been studied during morning, noon and evening periods of local daytime. Using the Long Wave Propagation Capability code V 2. 1 the D-region reference height (H/) and sharpness factor (β) for each class of solar flare (C, M and X), have been estimated. It is found that D-region ionospheric parameters (H/, β) strongly depend on the local time of flares occurrence and their classes.
