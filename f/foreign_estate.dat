40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Tax)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Death {{and taxes}} are unavoidable. In {{terms of the}} current {{legislation}} both estate duty and capital gains tax (hereinafter referred to as 'CGT') are levied upon death. The South African National Treasury is reconsidering taxes on death as estate duty contributes minuscule revenue, and its administration is cumbersome. Worldwide taxation is based on either source or residence. Because of the R 3 500 000 exemption from estate duty, only wealthy individuals are generally subject to estate duty. Wealthy individuals {{make use of the}} annual R 4 000 000 foreign investment capital allowance by owning offshore property. The aim {{of this study is to}} document how death taxes are currently levied on an estate which holds offshore property, given the perception that foreign property is exempt from death duties, and also to consider the impact on taxes payable on offshore property at death if estate duty were to be abolished. These objectives cannot be achieved without a thorough understanding of the development and future of estate duty, the impact of CGT on death, how selected foreign countries levy taxes upon death, and how residents of South Africa are taxed on property situated within foreign countries. When CGT was introduced in 2001 the estate duty rate was reduced and it is likely that, if estate duty is repealed, the rate of CGT will be increased. In South Africa, residents are taxed on worldwide income and capital gains. The international perspective is that the foreign country has the sovereignty to levy taxes on a person who owns property situated within its boundaries. An estate which holds offshore property may also be subject to estate duty in terms of the tax law of that country which results in double taxation in the hands of the deceased estate. South Africa has concluded international agreements with a number of foreign countries through double tax agreements and estate tax treaties to prevent double taxation. In terms of the Estate Duty Act, and in some of the treaties, a rebate is allowed in respect of <b>foreign</b> <b>estate</b> taxes paid. However, if estate duty is abolished, the deceased estate may be liable for estate tax in the foreign country where the assets are situated and the deceased estate may not qualify for any rebate in South Africa in respect of foreign taxes paid. Hence, the abolition may have detrimental consequences on the liquidity requirements, and on the heirs, in cases where offshore property is involved. It is vital that proper estate and tax planning advice is given before a resident acquires offshore property as the tax implications may be enormous. The current impact of estate duty and CGT on a resident who owns offshore assets is that the said taxes will be levied either here in South Africa or in the foreign country. The effect of capital transfer tax on a resident with an offshore asset can never be underestimated. Master...|$|E
40|$|The European Union Insolvency Regulation (the EU Regulation) is a {{giant step}} forward in {{promoting}} international cooperation among EU countries for cross-border insolvency proceedings. It adopts a modified universalist solution to cross-border proceedings insofar as they are located within the EU. However, experience has shown that it needs improvement to work effectively. A venue battle now rages between courts of several European countries over which country 2 ̆ 7 s courts will administer particular cross-border proceedings and how the center of main interest is to be determined for this purpose. This Article begins with a detailed examination of the two principal cases where conflicts have arisen, Eurofood and Daisytek. Eurofood is a subsidiary of Parmalat, which has produced the largest invsolvency case in European history. The Irish and Italian courts have both opened main insolvency proceedings for the Eurofood subsidiary, and the controversy is now pending before the European Court of Justice (ECJ). For the Daisytek French subsidiary, both English and French courts have opened main insolvency cases, and an appeal is pending before the French Cour de Cassation, where the Ministry of Justice is expected to recommend submission to the ECJ. Two very important substantive modifications would vastly improve the EU Regulation. First. the EU Regulation needs {{to provide for the}} filing in the same country (thereby permitting the filing in the same court) of members of a corporate group that are economically integrated. It is very difficult (if at all possible) to recognize a corporate empire when its insolvency proceedings are distributed among a number of countries. Second, the EU Regulation needs to clarify the definition of 2 ̆ 2 center of main interest 2 ̆ 2 (CoMI) and to specify what a court should consider in making the CoMI decision. A court should weigh the following factors: (1) the location of operations and management decisions for the corporation; (2) the location of the 2 ̆ 2 nerve center 2 ̆ 2 or place of principal decision-making for the corporation; and (3) the expectations of creditors, such as suppliers and financiers, as to the CoMI decision in the event that the company foes into an insolvency proceeding. This Article also argues for three kinds of procedural improvements: (1) decoupling the decision on whether a proceeding is a main proceeding from the decision opening the proceeding itself, to give an opportunity to the parties in interest to be heard on the subject of whether a proceeding is a main proceeding; (2) defining what constitutes a 2 ̆ 2 judgment opening insolvency proceedings, 2 ̆ 2 to specify what steps qualify under this term in those countries where an opening order or judgment is not a typical part of the insolvency process; (3) adopting procedures to recognize the due process rights of <b>foreign</b> <b>estate</b> administrators, foreign creditors, and other parties in interest in a cross-border insolvency proceeding...|$|E

Soon after China reopened its real estate market in the late 1980 s, <b>foreign</b> real <b>estate</b> investors began to enter this new market. After peaking in mid- 1990 s, the Chinese real estate market was relatively inactive until early 2000 s when it started to experience strong growth. The rocketing house prices have incited strong criticism among the people. The central government is very concerned about the public outcry and various measures have been introduced to cool down the red hot real estate market.

40|$|In {{recent years}} studies {{examining}} international mixed-asset portfolios {{have failed to}} uncover any significant benefits from <b>foreign</b> real <b>estate.</b> These papers have concentrated their focus on {{foreign exchange rate risk}} as "the problem" with respect to foreign investments, and therefore they sought solutions from traditional hedging tools such as leverage, options, forward contracts and even currency swaps. This study considers differences among countries in national income tax rates as a plausible explanation for the interest in <b>foreign</b> real <b>estate</b> investment. Hypothetically, it may be possible for investors to move a portion of their wealth to a foreign country and take advantage of lower marginal tax rates. After-tax returns from mixed-asset portfolios consisting of (1) domestic financial assets only, (2) domestic financial assets plus foreign financial assets, and (3) domestic financial assets, foreign financial assets and <b>foreign</b> real <b>estate</b> are evaluated. The findings indicate that there are no significant after-tax benefits for foreign investors from investment in U. S. real estate. ...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach - Applying panel data technique, this paper uses related observations from 31 countries (inclusive of developed countries and emerging market economies) between 2000 and 2008 to investigate the relationships between real estate market factors and FREI. Findings - Controlling for market size, infrastructure and political stability, the results for all countries indicate that lower financing costs and higher levels of transparency in real estate market attract greater amounts of FREI. Moreover, the paper finds that <b>foreign</b> real <b>estate</b> investors favor countries with higher property prices. Interestingly, when the paper splits the sample in developed countries and emerging market economies the paper finds that there are some differences in results in terms of determinants of FREI.
