5|$|The bony {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the temporal bone. The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called <b>endolymph,</b> which fills the membranous labyrinth. The <b>endolymph</b> is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the cochlear duct, and the tympanic duct. Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli {{are present in the}} organ of Corti in the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|As the {{cochlear}} duct’s mesenchyme begins to differentiate, three cavities are formed: the scala vestibuli, the scala tympani and the scala media. Both the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani contain an extracellular fluid called perilymph. The scala media contains <b>endolymph.</b> A set of membranes called the vestibular membrane and the basilar membrane develop to separate {{the cochlear}} duct from the vestibular duct and the tympanic duct, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound to a second window (the oval window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations. Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the <b>endolymph</b> within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|E
25|$|The {{lengthwise}} partition {{that divides}} {{most of the}} cochlea is itself a fluid-filled tube, the third duct. This central column is called the cochlear duct. Its fluid, <b>endolymph,</b> also contains electrolytes and proteins, but is chemically quite different from perilymph. Whereas the perilymph is rich in sodium ions, the <b>endolymph</b> is rich in potassium ions, which produces an ionic, electrical potential.|$|E
25|$|The perilymph in the {{vestibular}} duct and the <b>endolymph</b> in {{the cochlear}} duct act mechanically {{as a single}} duct, being kept apart only by the very thin Reissner's membrane.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to exocrine glands, NKCC1 {{is necessary for}} establishing the potassium-rich <b>endolymph</b> that bathes part of the cochlea, an organ necessary for hearing. Inhibition of NKCC1, as with furosemide or other loop diuretics, can result in deafness.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the fifth}} week of development, the {{auditory}} vesicle also {{gives rise to the}} cochlear duct, which contains the spiral organ of Corti and the <b>endolymph</b> that accumulates in the membranous labyrinth. The vestibular wall will separate the cochlear duct from the perilymphatic scala vestibuli, a cavity inside the cochlea. The basilar membrane separates the cochlear duct from the scala tympani, a cavity within the cochlear labyrinth. The lateral wall of the cochlear duct is formed by the spiral ligament and the stria vascularis, which produces the <b>endolymph.</b> The hair cells develop from the lateral and medial ridges of the cochlear duct, which together with the tectorial membrane make up the organ of Corti.|$|E
25|$|In rare cases, the {{crystals}} themselves can {{adhere to a}} semicircular canal cupula, rendering it heavier than the surrounding <b>endolymph.</b> Upon reorientation of the head relative to gravity, the cupula is weighted down by the dense particles, thereby inducing an immediate and sustained excitation of semicircular canal afferent nerves. This condition is termed cupulolithiasis.|$|E
25|$|The {{vibrations}} of the <b>endolymph</b> in {{the cochlear}} duct displace the basilar membrane {{in a pattern}} that peaks {{a distance from the}} oval window depending upon the soundwave frequency. The organ of Corti vibrates due to outer hair cells further amplifying these vibrations. Inner hair cells are then displaced by the vibrations in the fluid, and depolarise by an influx of K+ via their tip-link-connected channels, and send their signals via neurotransmitter to the primary auditory neurons of the spiral ganglion.|$|E
25|$|In reptiles, {{sound is}} {{transmitted}} to the inner ear by the stapes (stirrup) bone of the middle ear. This is pressed against the oval window, a membrane-covered opening {{on the surface of}} the vestibule. From here, sound waves are conducted through a short perilymphatic duct to a second opening, the round window, which equalizes pressure, allowing the incompressible fluid to move freely. Running parallel with the perilymphatic duct is a separate blind-ending duct, the lagena, filled with <b>endolymph.</b> The lagena is separated from the perilymphatic duct by a basilar membrane, and contains the sensory hair cells that finally translate the vibrations in the fluid into nerve signals. It is attached at one end to the saccule.|$|E
25|$|An {{inner ear}} {{decompression}} model by Doolette and Mitchell {{suggests that a}} transient increase in gas tension after a switch from helium to nitrogen in breathing gas may result from the difference in gas transfer between compartments. If the transport of nitrogen into the vascular compartment by perfusion exceeds removal of helium by perfusion, while transfer of helium into the vascular compartment by diffusion from the perilymph and <b>endolymph</b> exceeds the counterdiffusion of nitrogen, this {{may result in a}} temporary increase in total gas tension, as the input of nitrogen exceeds the removal of helium, which can result in bubble formation and growth. This model suggests that diffusion of gases from the middle ear across the round window is negligible. The model is not necessarily applicable to all tissue types.|$|E
500|$|The {{inner ear}} houses the {{apparatus}} necessary {{to change the}} vibrations transmitted {{from the outside world}} via the middle ear into signals passed along the vestibulocochlear nerve to the brain. The hollow channels of the inner ear are filled with liquid, and contain a sensory epithelium that is studded with hair cells. The microscopic [...] "hairs" [...] of these cells are structural protein filaments that project out into the fluid. The hair cells are mechanoreceptors that release a chemical neurotransmitter when stimulated. Sound waves moving through fluid flows against the receptor cells of the organ of Corti. The fluid pushes the filaments of individual cells; movement of the filaments causes receptor cells to become open to receive the potassium-rich <b>endolymph.</b> This causes the cell to depolarise, and creates an action potential that is transmitted along the spiral ganglion, which sends information through the auditory portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve to the temporal lobe of the brain.|$|E
2500|$|Alcohol {{can affect}} balance by {{altering}} the viscosity of the <b>endolymph</b> within the otolithic membrane, the fluid inside the semicircular canals inside the ear. The <b>endolymph</b> surrounds the ampullary cupula which contains hair cells within the semicircular canals. [...] When {{the head is}} tilted, the <b>endolymph</b> flows and moves the cupula. The hair cells then bend and send signals to the brain indicating {{the direction in which}} the head is tilted. [...] By changing the viscosity of the <b>endolymph</b> to become less dense when alcohol enters the system, the hair cells can move more easily within the ear, which sends the signal to the brain and results in exaggerated and overcompensated movements of body. [...] This can also result in vertigo, or [...] "the spins." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{cochlear}} duct {{is almost as}} complex on its own as the ear itself. [...] The {{cochlear duct}} is bounded on three sides by the basilar membrane, the stria vascularis, and Reissner's membrane. [...] Stria vascularis is a rich bed of capillaries and secretory cells; Reissner's membrane is a thin membrane that separates <b>endolymph</b> from perilymph; and the basilar membrane is a mechanically somewhat stiff membrane, supporting the receptor organ for hearing, the organ of Corti, and determines the mechanical wave propagation properties of the cochlear system.|$|E
2500|$|Within the {{labyrinth}} of the inner ear lie collections of calcium crystals known as otoconia or otoliths. In patients with BPPV, the otoconia are dislodged from their usual position within the utricle, and migrate over time {{into one of the}} semicircular canals (the posterior canal is most commonly affected due to its anatomical position). When the head is reoriented relative to gravity, the gravity-dependent movement of the heavier otoconial debris (colloquially [...] "ear rocks") within the affected semicircular canal causes abnormal (pathological) <b>endolymph</b> fluid displacement and a resultant sensation of vertigo. This more common condition is known as canalithiasis.|$|E
2500|$|Gap-junction proteins, called connexins, {{expressed}} in the cochlea {{play an important role}} in auditory functioning. Mutations in gap-junction genes have been found to cause syndromic and nonsyndromic deafness. [...] Certain connexins, including connexin 30 and connexin 26, are prevalent in the two distinct gap-junction systems found in the cochlea. [...] The epithelial-cell gap-junction network couples non-sensory epithelial cells, while the connective-tissue gap-junction network couples connective-tissue cells. [...] Gap-junction channels recycle potassium ions back to the <b>endolymph</b> after mechanotransduction in hair cells. [...] Importantly, gap junction channels are found between cochlear supporting cells, but not auditory hair cells.|$|E
6000|$|Section 116. The eighth nerve {{runs from}} the brain case (Cr.), into the periotic bone, and is {{distributed}} to the several portions of this labyrinth. In an ordinary fish this internal ear is the sole auditory organ we should find; the sound-waves would travel through the water to the elastic cranium and so reach and affect the nerves. But in all air-frequenting animals this original plan of an ear has to be added to, to fit it to the much fainter sound vibrations of the compressible and far less elastic air. A [...] "receiving apparatus" [...] is needed, and is supplied by the ear-drum, middle ear, or tympanic cavity (T.). In the mammal {{there is also a}} collecting ear trumpet (the ear commonly so-called), the external ear, and external auditory meatus (e.a.m.). A tightly stretched membrane, the tympanic membrane, separates this from the drum. A chain of small bones, the malleus (m.), the incus (i.), the os orbiculare (o.or.), a very small bone, and a stirrup-shaped stapes, swing across the tympanum, from the tympanic membrane to the internal ear. At two points the bony investment of this last is incomplete-- at the fenestra rotunda (f.r.), and at the fenestra ovalis, (f.o.), into which latter the end of the stapes fits, and so communicates the sound vibrations of the tympanic membrane to the <b>endolymph.</b> A passage, the Eustachian tube, communicates between the tympanic cavity and the pharynx (Ph.), and serves to equalize the pressure {{on either side of the}} drum-head. A comparative study of the ears of the vertebrata brings to light the fact that, as we descend in the animal scale, the four ear ossicles are replaced by large bones and cartilages connected with the jaw, and the drum and Eustachian tube by a gill slit. We have, in fact, in the ear, as the student will perceive in the sequel, an essentially aquatic auditory organ, added to and patched up to fit the new needs of a life out of water.|$|E
50|$|Endolymphatic hydrops is a {{disorder}} {{of the inner}} ear. It consists of an excessive build-up of the <b>endolymph</b> fluid, which fills the hearing and balance structures of the inner ear. <b>Endolymph</b> fluid, which is partly regulated by the <b>endolymph</b> sac, flows through the inner ear and {{is critical to the}} function of all sensory cells in the inner ear. In addition to water, <b>endolymph</b> fluid contains salts such as sodium, potassium, chloride and other electrolytes. If the inner ear is damaged by disease or injury, the volume and composition of the <b>endolymph</b> fluid can change, causing the symptoms of endolymphatic hydrops.|$|E
50|$|<b>Endolymph</b> is {{the fluid}} {{contained}} within the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear; <b>endolymph</b> resembles intracellular fluid in composition (potassium is the main cation).|$|E
5000|$|Balance: Semicircular canals: angular {{acceleration}} of the <b>endolymph</b> in the semicircular canals stimulate the vestibular receptors of the <b>endolymph.</b> The semicircular canals of both inner ears act in concert to coordinate balance.|$|E
50|$|Perilymph and <b>endolymph</b> have unique ionic {{compositions}} {{suited to}} their functions in regulating electrochemical impulses of hair cells. The electric potential of <b>endolymph</b> is ~80-90 mV more positive than perilymph {{due to a}} higher concentration of K compared to Na.|$|E
50|$|There are 5 {{sensory organs}} innervated by the {{vestibular}} nerve; 3 semicircular canals (HSCC, SSCC, PSCC) and 2 otolith organs. Each semicircular canal (SSC) {{is a thin}} tube that thickens briefly (2x thin diameter), at a point called osseous ampullae. At their center-base each contains an ampullary cupula. The cupula is a gelatin bulb connected to stereocilia, affected by the relative movement of the <b>endolymph</b> it is bathed in. Since the cupula {{is part of the}} bony labyrinth it rotates along with actual head movement unable to cause stimulation by itself; that is, if <b>endolymph</b> was not present, movement could not be detected. <b>Endolymph</b> follows the rotation of the canal, however, due to inertia lags behind initially, which bends and activates the cupula. After any extended rotation the <b>endolymph</b> catches up to the canal and the cupula returns to its upright position and resets. When extended rotation ceases, however, <b>endolymph</b> continues, (due to inertia) which bends and activates the cupula.|$|E
50|$|Perilymph and <b>endolymph</b> have unique ionic {{compositions}} {{suited to}} their functions in regulating electrochemical impulses of hair cells.

50|$|Disruption of the <b>endolymph</b> due to jerky {{movements}} (like {{spinning around}} or driving over bumps while {{riding in a}} car) can cause motion sickness.

50|$|The fluids {{in these}} two tubes, the <b>endolymph</b> and the perilymph are very {{different}} chemically, biochemically, and electrically. Therefore, they are kept strictly separated. This separation is the main function of Reissner's membrane (between scala vestibuli and scala media), {{and it is also}} the function of tissue held by the basilar membrane such as the inner and outer sulcus cells (shown in yellow) and the reticular lamina of the organ of Corti (shown in magenta). For the organ of Corti the basilar membrane is permeable to perilymph. Here the border between <b>endolymph</b> and perilymph occurs at the reticular lamina, the <b>endolymph</b> side of the organ of Corti.|$|E

5000|$|The Buoyancy Hypothesis {{posits that}} alcohol causes vertigo by {{affecting}} the neutral buoyancy of the cupula within the surrounding fluid called the <b>endolymph.</b> Linear accelerations (such {{as that of}} gravity) should not in theory effect a movement of the cupula when it is neutrally buoyant. The Buoyancy Hypothesis assumes that alcohol, with a different specific gravity {{from that of the}} cupula/endolymph, diffuses at different rates into the cupula and the surrounding <b>endolymph.</b> The result is a temporary density gradient between the cupula and <b>endolymph,</b> and a consequent (erroneous) sensitivity to linear accelerations such as that of gravity by a system normally signalling rotational accelerations.
