5|$|Jackson {{assisted}} Clair Brothers by teaming with Ron Borthwick {{to design}} a mixing console that folded up into its own road case, a proprietary model used by Clair Brothers for some 12 years of top tours. The console used novel plasma bargraph meters which displayed both average and peak sound levels, combining the characteristics of fast peak meters and slower VU meters. Clair Brothers built 10 of the consoles, the first live sound console to incorporate parametric <b>equalisation.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of Zobel network filters {{is that they}} have a constant resistance image impedance and for this reason are also known as constant resistance networks. Clearly, the Zobel network filter does not have a problem matching to its terminations and this is its main advantage. However, other filter types have steeper transfer functions and sharper cut-offs. In filtering applications, the main role of Zobel networks is as <b>equalisation</b> filters. Zobel networks are in a different group from other image filters. The constant resistance means that when used in combination with other image filter sections the same problem of matching arises as with end terminations. Zobel networks also suffer the disadvantage of using far more components than other equivalent image sections.|$|E
5|$|However the ECSC {{failed to}} achieve several {{fundamental}} aims of the Treaty of Paris. It was hoped the ECSC would prevent a resurgence of large coal and steel {{groups such as the}} Konzerne, which helped Adolf Hitler rise to power. In the Cold War trade-offs, the cartels and major companies re-emerged, leading to apparent price fixing (another element that was meant to be tackled). With a democratic supervisory system the worst aspects of past abuse were avoided with the anti-cartel powers of the Authority, the first international anti-cartel agency in the world. Efficient firms were allowed to expand into a European market without undue domination. Oil, gas, electricity became natural competitors to coal and also broke cartel powers. Furthermore, with the move to oil, the Community failed to define a proper energy policy. The Euratom treaty was largely stifled by de Gaulle and the European governments refused the suggestion of an Energy Community involving electricity and other vectors that was suggested at Messina in 1955. In a time of high inflation and monetary instability ECSC also fell short of ensuring an upward <b>equalisation</b> of pay of workers within the market. These failures could be put down to overambition {{in a short period of}} time, or that the goals were merely political posturing to be ignored. It has been argued that the greatest achievements of the European Coal and Steel Community lie in its revolutionary democratic concepts of a supranational Community.|$|E
5|$|In {{this book}} I {{maintained}} that a sphere of freedom is still desirable {{even in a}} socialist state, but this sphere has to be defined afresh and not in liberal terms. This doctrine I still hold. The thesis of this book seems to me important, and I hoped that it would attract more attention than it has done. It {{was intended as a}} refutation both of Marx and of the classical economists, not on a point of detail, but on the fundamental assumptions that they shared. I argued that power, rather than wealth, should be the basic concept in social theory, and that social justice should consist in <b>equalisation</b> of power to the greatest practicable degree. It followed that State ownership of land and capital was no advance unless the State was democratic, and even then only if methods were devised for curbing the power of officials. A part of my thesis was taken up and popularised in Burnham's Managerial Revolution, but otherwise the book fell rather flat. I still hold, however, that what it has to say is of very great importance if the evils of totalitarianism are to be avoided, particularly under a Socialist régime.|$|E

25|$|<b>Equalisation</b> of {{pressure}} in gas spaces to avoid barotraumas. The expansion or compression of enclosed air spaces may cause discomfort or injury while diving. Critically, the lungs {{are susceptible to}} over-expansion and subsequent collapse if a diver holds their breath while ascending: during training divers are taught to never hold their breath while diving. Ear clearing is another critical <b>equalisation</b> procedure, usually requiring conscious intervention by the diver.|$|E
25|$|Two vote {{management}} systems exist in STV. Vote <b>equalisation</b> works for all systems except those that allow group voting (above the line voting). The other method, party designated transfer, only works for systems that allow group voting. A party employing a vote <b>equalisation</b> strategy {{would attempt to}} ensure that all its candidates obtain an equal number of first preference votes, in the hope that transfers from candidates of other parties eliminated early in the count will lead to the election of an increased number of its candidates.|$|E

25|$|A {{salary cap}} (known as the Total Player Payments or TPP) {{is also in}} place {{as part of the}} league's <b>equalisation</b> policy; this is A$9,130,000 for the 2013 season with a salary floor of $8,673,500 except for the Gold Coast, whose salary cap will be A$9,630,000 with a salary floor of $9,171,500, and Greater Western Sydney, whose salary cap is $9,987,000 with a floor of $9,530,500. As part of the AFL's {{enhanced}} <b>equalisation</b> policies, in 2014 the league announced an increase of the TPP for the 2015 and 2016 seasons. TPP increases an additional $150,000 per club in 2015 above previously contracted amounts, increasing from $9.92m to $10.07m in 2015 and $10.22m to $10.37m in 2016.|$|E
25|$|If section 444AA applies, an {{accounting}} {{period of the}} transferor company ends immediately before the transfer, and the transferor also has {{an accounting}} period covering the instant of the transfer (except {{for the purposes of}} calculating the <b>equalisation</b> provision for tax purposes).|$|E
25|$|A {{growing number}} of {{portable}} media players are including audio processing chips that allow digital effects like 3D audio effects, dynamic range compression and <b>equalisation</b> of the frequency response. Some devices adjust loudness based on Fletcher–Munson curves. Some media players are used with Noise-cancelling headphones that use Active noise reduction to remove background noise.|$|E
25|$|As a diver descends, {{they must}} {{periodically}} exhale through their nose to equalise the internal {{pressure of the}} mask {{with that of the}} surrounding water. Swimming goggles are not suitable for diving because they only cover the eyes and thus do not allow for <b>equalisation.</b> Failure to equalise the pressure inside the mask may lead to a form of barotrauma known as mask squeeze.|$|E
25|$|When the diver descends {{the ambient}} {{pressure}} rises {{and it becomes}} necessary to equalise the pressure inside the mask with the ambient pressure to avoid the barotrauma known as mask squeeze, This is done by blowing sufficient air out through the nose into the mask to relieve the pressure difference. This requires that the nose {{is included in the}} airspace of the diving mask. <b>Equalisation</b> during ascent is automatic as excess air easily leaks past the seal from inside.|$|E
25|$|The {{power supply}} was {{connected}} to the traction power network by means of two new spur lines running via three new substations at Roth, Ilmenau and Eischleben. The existing Ebensfeld substation was expanded for the power supply of the new line. There was no <b>equalisation</b> of the earth masses, which meant that about 16 million cubic metres of earth was deposited at 24 landfill sites. Near Masserberg. for example, 1.8million cubic metres was dumped covering an area of 54.8hectares, with a maximum height of 27metres.|$|E
25|$|Plank used radical {{combinations}} of echo, reverberation and other electronic, mixing, <b>equalisation,</b> editing and tape-based effects to create mixes {{in which every}} element might be given its own highly individual sound environment, and in which each of these elements might alter radically in sound several times {{over the course of}} a track. In this he was undoubtedly influenced by the work of Jamaican pioneers like Lee 'Scratch' Perry but he was certainly one of the first European producers to adopt key stylistic innovations sourced from these reggae and dub production techniques.|$|E
25|$|The {{goods and}} {{services}} tax (GST) is a value-added tax introduced in Australia in 2000, which is collected by the Australian Tax Office. The revenue is then redistributed {{to the states and}} territories via the Commonwealth Grants Commission process. In essence, this is Australia's program of horizontal fiscal <b>equalisation.</b> Whilst the rate is currently set at 10%, there are many domestically consumed items that are effectively zero-rated (GST-free) such as fresh food, education, and health services, certain medical products, as well as exemptions for Government charges and fees that are themselves in the nature of taxes.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Cutler was {{drumming}} for Henry Cow in 1971, {{he had become}} a perfectly competent, albeit unconventional, drummer. The nature of Henry Cow was to experiment and explore and it was here that Cutler developed and refined his drumming techniques. It was also here that he started to electrify his drum kit. He began by attaching old telephone mouthpieces to drums and cymbals, and connecting them to an amplifier and a reverb unit. He later added a small mixer for four independent inputs. The effect was very basic: a few low-grade inputs with only <b>equalisation</b> and reverberation to manipulate.|$|E
25|$|Equalising of {{the mask}} is an {{essential}} skill for any form of diving. Goggles that do not cover the nose can not be equalised and are unsuitable for diving. The mask is equalised by exhaling sufficient air through the nose to provide a balanced internal pressure. Any excess will simply leak out around the skirt. Equalising (or clearing) the ears is necessary to prevent barotrauma to the middle and inner ear. Some divers need to pinch the nostrils closed {{as part of their}} <b>equalisation</b> technique, and this must be allowed for in the design {{of the mask}} skirt.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1970s, Bihar has lagged far behind other Indian states {{in terms of}} social and {{economic}} development. Many economists and social scientists claim that this {{is a direct result of}} the policies of the central government, such as the Freight <b>equalisation</b> policy, its apathy towards Bihar, lack of Bihari sub-nationalism, and the Permanent Settlement of 1793 by the British East India Company. The state government has, however, made significant strides in developing the state. Improved governance has led to an economic revival in the state through increased investment in infrastructure, better health care facilities, greater emphasis on education, and a reduction in crime and corruption.|$|E
25|$|The same year, in her {{capacity}} as Minister for Health, Mary Harney introduced risk <b>equalisation</b> into the Irish healthcare market. This was hugely resisted by BUPA. Despite High Court proceedings, the controversial change was upheld. This forced BUPA {{out of the}} Irish healthcare market. (BUPA Ireland was afterwards bought by the Irish-owned Quinn Group, averting any fear of redundancies.) In January 2007 a leaked memo said that the planned Cancer Care Strategy, due for completion in 2011, would not be delivered on time. Harney denied this and said that since the leaking of the memo there had been much progress, although she did not elaborate. The plan was to allow for nationwide radiotherapy services by 2011.|$|E
25|$|Where old disc {{recordings}} {{are considered}} to be of artistic or historic interest, from before the era of tape or where no tape master exists, archivists play back the disc on suitable equipment and record the result, typically onto a digital format, which can be copied and manipulated to remove analog flaws without any further damage to the source recording. For example, Nimbus Records uses a specially built horn record player to transfer 78s. Anyone can do this using a standard record player with a suitable pickup, a phono-preamp (pre-amplifier) and a typical personal computer. However, for accurate transfer, professional archivists carefully choose the correct stylus shape and diameter, tracking weight, <b>equalisation</b> curve and other playback parameters and use high-quality analogue-to-digital converters.|$|E
25|$|The staccato delivery, harsh tone, {{and rising}} {{inflection}} of the Dalek voice were initially developed by voice actors Peter Hawkins and David Graham, who would vary the pitch {{and speed of}} the lines according to the emotion needed. Their voices were further processed electronically by Brian Hodgson at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Although the exact sound-processing devices used have varied, the original 1963 effect used <b>equalisation</b> to boost the mid-range of the actor's voice, then subjected it to ring modulation with a 30Hz sine wave. The distinctive harsh grating vocal timbre this produced has remained the pattern for all Dalek voices since (with the exception {{of those in the}} 1985 serial Revelation of the Daleks, for which director Graeme Harper deliberately used less distortion).|$|E
25|$|Before {{putting on}} the dry suit, the male diver puts on a condom catheter, {{which is similar to}} a condom except that it is made of thicker {{material}} with a cuff or adhesive ring to prevent it from slipping off, and its end connects to a built-on drain tube. After putting it on, he attaches the end of the tube to a drain hose in the crotch of the suit. This hose leads to a fitting through the front of one thigh of the suit, either with a screw-down outlet valve (P-valve), opened for use, or a non-return valve to prevent water from flowing back in if the hose gets disconnected. There may also be a non-return <b>equalisation</b> valve allowing gas from inside the suit to flow into the hose to avoid squeeze during descent The female diver puts on an external catching device {{in the form of a}} wide-rimmed, low-profile, elongated cup. The rim is affixed onto the skin surrounding the labia with medical grade glue. The cup's outlet connects to the drain hose with similar fitting on the suit.|$|E
25|$|Reform in the College of Surgeons was slow, and Wakley now {{set himself}} to rouse the House of Commons from within. He became a radical {{candidate}} for Parliament and in 1835 was returned for Finsbury; he retained his seat till 1852. Even after his departure, {{his work was}} {{largely responsible for the}} content of the Medical Act of 1858. He spoke in the House of Commons against the Poor Laws, police bills, newspaper tax and Lord's Day observance and for Chartism, Tolpuddle Martyrs, free trade, Irish nationalism and, of course, medical reform. All the topics were vigorously debated and fought over, for the 1830s was a turbulent decade; the origin of the difficulties lay in the massively expensive Napoleonic Wars, and in the inherent injustice of the way British law and Parliament operated. The Chartist demands were 1. Universal suffrage for adult men 2. Annual Parliaments 3. Payment for members of Parliament 4. Abolition of property qualifications for candidates 5. Vote by ballot (i.e. secret voting) 6. Abolition of rotten boroughs (rough <b>equalisation</b> of electoral districts). Apart from annual Parliaments, but it took time. The effect was to give ordinary citizens a direct say in how the country was governed. Wakley was one of many campaigners; his influence was greater than most because he was now inside Parliament.|$|E

The 13-element crossover includes an inductor for the treble section with seven positions that allows adjustment to match level of mid to treble sensitivities. The design also specifies high quality screened air-gap inductors and film capacitors. David Prakel in Hi-Fi Answers suggests it was a costlier speaker to build than imagined because tight specifications meant a high failure rate in production – the BBC had specified [...] "the finest, most expensive ingredients and representing an investment of hours of skilled labour".|$|E
500|$|It is {{impossible}} to know how many died from salt deprivation in India {{as a result of the}} salt tax as salt deficiency was not often recorded as a cause of death and was instead more likely to worsen the effects of other diseases and hinder recoveries. [...] It is known that the <b>equalisation</b> of tax made salt cheaper on the whole, decreasing the tax imposed on 130million people and increasing it on just 47million, leading to an increase in the use of the mineral. [...] Consumption grew by 50percent between 1868 and 1888 and doubled by 1911, by which time salt had become cheaper (relatively) than at any earlier stage of Indian history.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} two decades, the {{recordings}} were licensed to several record companies, resulting in numerous releases with varying track selections. In 1979, Pickwick Records performed some additional audio filtering and <b>equalisation</b> of the songs on the Lingasong US version, and released it over two volumes as First Live Recordings; the set included the song [...] "Hully Gully" [...] that was mistakenly credited to The Beatles, but was actually performed by Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers, another act on the Star-Club bill. In 1981, Audio Fidelity Enterprises released Historic Sessions in the UK, the first single package with all 30 Beatles tracks from the original Star-Club releases. Several additional songs from the Star-Club tapes have appeared on Beatles bootleg records over the years.|$|E
500|$|The {{need for}} frequency-independent delay in {{satellite}} applications {{led to more}} research into the waveguide incarnation of cross-coupled filters. [...] Previously, satellite communications systems used a separate component for delay <b>equalisation.</b> [...] The additional degrees of freedom obtained from cross-coupled filters held {{out the possibility of}} designing a flat delay into a filter without compromising other performance parameters. [...] A component that simultaneously functioned as both filter and equaliser would save valuable weight and space. [...] The needs of satellite communication also drove research into the more exotic resonator modes in the 1970s. [...] Of particular prominence in this respect is the work of E. L. Griffin and F. A. Young, who investigated better modes for the [...] band when this began to be used for satellites in the mid-1970s.|$|E
500|$|The massive {{scale of}} the {{undertaking}} has also been commented upon, with both Hume, the customs commissioner, and M. E. Grant Duff, who was Under-Secretary of State for India from 1868 to 1874, comparing the hedge to the Great Wall of China. [...] The abolition {{of the line and}} <b>equalisation</b> of tax has generally been viewed as a good move, with one writer of 1901 stating that it [...] "relieved the people and the trade along a broad belt of country, 2,000 miles long, from much harassment". Sir Richard Temple, governor of the Bengal and Bombay Presidencies, wrote in 1882 that [...] "the inland customs line for levying the salt-duties has been at length swept away" [...] and that care must be taken to ensure that the [...] "evils of the obsolete transit-duties" [...] did not return.|$|E
500|$|Throughout his {{national}} campaigns, Lansbury remained a Poplar borough councillor and [...] Poor Law guardian, and between 1910 and 1913 served [...] a three-year term as a London County Councillor. In 1919 {{he became the}} first Labour mayor of Poplar. [...] Under the then-existing financial system for local government, boroughs were individually responsible [...] for poor relief within their boundaries. This discriminated heavily against poorer councils such as Poplar, where rates revenues were low and [...] poverty and unemployment, always severe, were exacerbated in times of economic recession. Under this system, Postgate argues, [...] "The wealthy West End boroughs were evading responsibility, as though the desolate and silent docks were the results of a failure by the Poplar Borough Council". In addition to meeting the costs of its own obligations, the council was required to levy precepts [...] to pay for [...] services provided by [...] bodies such as the London County Council and the Metropolitan Police. [...] Lansbury had long argued that a degree [...] of rates <b>equalisation</b> across London was necessary, to share [...] costs more fairly.|$|E
500|$|The Viceroy from 1869 to 1872, Lord Mayo, {{took the}} first steps towards {{abolition}} of the line, instructing British officials to negotiate agreements with the rulers of princely states {{to take control of}} salt production. [...] The process was speeded up by Mayo's successor, Lord Northbrook, and by the loss of revenue caused by the Great Famine of 1876–78 that reduced the land tax and killed 6.5million people. [...] Having secured salt production, British India's Finance Minister, Sir John Strachey, led a review of the tax system and his recommendations, implemented by Viceroy Lord Lytton, resulted in the increase of the salt tax in Madras, Bombay and northern India to 2.5rupees per maund and a reduction in Bengal to 2.9rupees. [...] This reduced difference in tax between neighbouring territories made smuggling uneconomical and allowed for the abandonment of the Inland Customs Line on 1 April 1879. [...] The tax on sugar and 29 other commodities had been abolished a year earlier. [...] Strachey's tax reforms continued, and he brought an end to import duties and almost complete free trade to India by 1880. [...] In 1882 Viceroy Lord Ripon finally standardised the salt tax across most of India at a rate of two rupees per maund. [...] However the trans-Indus districts of India continued to be taxed at eight annas (½rupee) per maund until 23 July 1896 and Burma maintained its reduced rate of just three annas. [...] The <b>equalisation</b> of tax cost the government 1.2million rupees of lost revenue. [...] The potential for salt to be smuggled from the Kohat (trans-Indus) region meant that the north-western section of the line, some 325 miles long from Layyah to Torbela, continued to be policed by the Department of Salt Revenue in Northern India until at least 1895.|$|E
