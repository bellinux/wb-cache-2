5|$|On June 19, 1763, about 250 Ottawa, Ojibwa, Wyandot, and Seneca warriors {{surrounded}} Fort Presque Isle (on {{the site}} of Erie, Pennsylvania), the eighth and final fort to fall. After <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> two days, the garrison of about 30 to 60 men surrendered, {{on the condition that}} they could return to Fort Pitt. The warriors killed most of the soldiers after they came out of the fort.|$|E
5|$|Mine owners still <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the 10-hour day soon {{attempted}} to re-open their mines. On March 14, they obtained a court injunction ordering the miners {{not to interfere}} with the operation of their mines, and hired strikebreakers. The WFM initially {{attempted to}} persuade these men to join the union and strike, but when they were unsuccessful, the union resorted to threats and violence. These tactics succeeded in driving non-union miners out of the district.|$|E
60|$|And north, at York, in {{the rear}} of those three insurrections lay Gospatrick, Waltheof, and Marlesweyn, with the Northumbrian host. Durham was lost, and Comyn burnt therein. But York, so boasted William Malet, could <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a year. He should not need to <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> so long.|$|R

Steinman said: [...] "I know I have got to <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> that. They don't give it to you if you have passed away. I got to <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> that." ...|$|R

5|$|Vicksburg was {{the last}} major Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River; therefore, {{capturing}} it completed {{the second part of}} the Northern strategy, the Anaconda Plan. When two major assaults (May 19 and 22, 1863) against the Confederate fortifications were repulsed with heavy casualties, Grant decided to besiege the city beginning on May 25. After <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> more than forty days, with no reinforcement and supplies nearly gone, the garrison finally surrendered on July 4.|$|E
5|$|After the 1992 season, Tolliver was a {{restricted}} free agent. Wilson {{signed a contract}} with the Saints, and to replace him the Falcons signed Bobby Hebert. Tolliver signed a one-year contract in August, after <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a time. Tolliver started the 1993 season as the third-string quarterback behind Hebert and Miller. However, Miller re-injured his left knee in late September, making Tolliver the main backup to Hebert. Tolliver made his first start against the Los Angeles Rams, but was injured in his second start against the Saints; the Falcons signed Chris Hakel {{as a result of the}} injury. Tolliver finished the season in occasional relief for Hebert, who remained bothered by injuries. Over the course of the year, Tolliver played in seven games and threw for just under 500 yards, and became a free agent after the season ended.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{fortress}} had been captured, Murad placed his own garrison of Janissaries and ordered {{his men to}} repair the walls. Perlati and his soldiers came to Skanderbeg, begging for mercy. Skanderbeg pardoned his soldiers for the surrender and even thanked them for <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> {{as long as they}} did. Skanderbeg continued to shadow the Ottoman army as it headed back home in the hopes of dealing some serious damage, but his forces were not strong enough to risk provoking them. In October of the same year, Murad managed to inflict a serious a defeat on John Hunyadi's forces in Kosovo. Skanderbeg had planned to join Hunyadi's offensive with 20,000 men, but {{he was not able to}} get there in time due to Đurađ Branković blocking the roads to Kosovo.|$|E

5|$|To the Allies, the Belgian {{failure to}} hold onto its eastern frontiers (they {{were thought to be}} capable of <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> two weeks), was a disappointment. The Allied Chiefs of Staff had sought to avoid an {{encounter}} mobile battle without any strong fixed defences to fall back on and hoped Belgian resistance would last long enough for a defensive line to be established. Nevertheless, a brief lull fell on the Dyle front on 11 May which enabled the Allied armies to get into position by the time the first major assault was launched the following day. Allied cavalry had moved into position and infantry and artillery were reaching the front more slowly, by rail. Although unaware of it, the First Allied army Group and the Belgian Army outnumbered and outgunned Walther von Reichenau's German 6th Army.|$|E
5|$|The New Year {{began with}} a second defeat of the season to Burton, this time being beaten 3–1 at home, in which Brodie scored {{in the first half}} with a shot {{from the edge of the}} penalty area. Wrexham defender Kyle Critchell was signed on a one-month loan, who Foyle knew while he was a coach at the club. Adam Smith {{returned}} to Gainsborough following the conclusion of his loan, while a permanent move had been stalled as Gainsborough were <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a fee. Progression to the third round of the FA Trophy was ensured with a 2–1 away victory over Oxford, with goals from McBreen and Brodie. Further signings from Wrexham took place when striker Simon Brown and midfielder Christian Smith signed on loan and permanently respectively. Hirst was released having failed to break into the first team. Lewes were beaten 3–0 at home; Brodie opened the scoring with a volley into the top corner from outside the penalty area, and Christian Smith scored from 30yards before Brodie finished the scoring with a low shot into the bottom corner. Henderson was released having fallen out of the reckoning for a first-team place.|$|E
5|$|Smith was {{released}} by Chesterfield after he was not offered a new contract {{at the end of}} 2007–08. He trialled with Darlington of League Two, but was told by manager Dave Penney he was not what they were looking for. He then had a trial with newly relegated Conference Premier club Wrexham and eventually signed a contract with Gainsborough Trinity of the Conference North in late August. Smith made a goalscoring debut for Gainsborough with the team's goal in a 1–1 draw at home to Vauxhall Motors on 30 August. He joined York City in the Conference Premier on loan on 27 November, becoming Martin Foyle's first signing as manager, in a deal that would expire on 6 January 2009. Smith made his debut after coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute for Craig Farrell in a 1–1 draw with Salisbury City. His first goal came after scoring the opener for York with a close range finish in a 3–1 victory over Ebbsfleet United. Following this, Foyle stated his intention of extending Smith's loan at York. Smith said he was looking to join the club on a permanent contract and that Gainsborough manager Steve Charles would allow him to leave for a club in a higher division on a free transfer. However, a move to York stalled in January as Gainsborough were <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a fee, although Foyle refused to pay this. York eventually made an offer of a quarter of Gainsborough's asking price, which was rejected.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season, Christopher {{was part}} of an optimistic 1945 Athletics team, so much so that coach Earle Mack felt that Christopher, Black, Newsom and Jesse Flores were the best quartet of starting pitchers in the league. He spent most of spring training <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a new contract, which was eventually agreed on in the middle of March. He missed the first couple weeks of the season due to injury, and won his season debut on April 18, a 12-inning shutout against the Senators. He followed that up with a victory over the Boston Red Sox, allowing only one earned run in his first 21 innings of the season. In mid-June, Christopher had won ten games, which not only led the league, but was more than the seven the rest of the Athletics pitching staff had combined. On July 21, Christopher {{was part of}} a 24-inning game against the Tigers that ended in a 1–1 tie; he went 13 innings in the game while Joe Berry pitched the other 11. Although Christopher had a strong start to the season, he struggled during the second half. He lost seven straight games over a two-month period before winning another on August 19 against the Tigers. He finished the year with a 13–13 record and a 3.17 ERA. He was selected to the American League All-Star team, however the game was canceled as a result of World War II.|$|E
5|$|After <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> 21 days, Davis {{was signed}} {{initially}} {{to a contract}} designed as a temporary compromise {{in order to get}} him into training camp on August 5, 1991. It was speculated that the reason behind Davis' holdout and the temporary compromise was that Davis and his agent wanted to see what McRae, who also held out with the Buccaneers, signed for first. Davis was not allowed to practice with the team until he was under contract, thus the compromise contract enabled him to practice while still work to get a long-term deal done. The compromise was a one-year contract with an option for a second year, and Davis received $600,000 in signing the first contract. He was able to play against the Cincinnati Bengals in the Eagles' third preseason game on August 10. Davis was projected to be the Eagles' starting right offensive tackle for the 1991 season. Davis suffered a sprained ankle while running laps around JFK Stadium and tripping over a goal post support on August 19. Due to the injury, he was taken out of the preseason game against the Indianapolis Colts on August 23 at halftime by Kotite. The Eagles and Davis finalized a five-year contract worth $4.6 million on September 6 following {{the first week of the}} season. Davis changed his jersey number from 77 to 78 after signing the contract. He had his best game of the season in week four against the Pittsburgh Steelers on September 22, as Kotite called more run plays to the right side towards the end of the game. Davis had a key block on a Jim McMahon quarterback sneak touchdown and McMahon gave Davis the ball immediately after to spike in celebration. The Eagles were given a five-yard penalty for the spike, however. In a week five game against the Washington Redskins on September 30, Davis gave up two sacks against defensive end Charles Mann, who received Pro Bowl honors after the season. Davis gave up a total of ten sacks in the first five games of the season.|$|E
25|$|After the 1998–99 season, Khabibulin became {{embroiled in}} a bitter {{contract}} dispute with the Coyotes, and ended up <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> an entire season. During this year, he played for the Long Beach Ice Dogs of the International Hockey League (IHL), earning the James Gatschene Memorial Trophy as league MVP.|$|E

50|$|After {{returning}} from America empty-handed, de Valera decrees that the IRA {{must make a}} formal military attack on The Custom House. Collins argues that fighting conventionally will allow the British to win, but the Cabinet votes to support de Valera. The attack fails catastrophically, leaving six men dead and seventy captured. In the aftermath, Collins declares that the IRA can only <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a month. In private, he tells Boland that the IRA will be lucky to <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> another week. To his surprise, however, the British soon call for a cease fire.|$|R

25|$|Evidently, {{there are}} still {{questions}} as to his specific reasons for leaving the game. There were even reports that Parcells had been <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> more money, and that Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones simply did not think Parcells' performance was worth the money he was demanding for the upcoming season.|$|E
25|$|Dissatisfied by {{contract}} offers {{proposed by}} the Yankees, Womack and fellow pitcher Al Downing did not initially report to spring training in 1968 — they were <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a better offer. Womack's holdout was short-lived, however, as {{within a couple of}} days he came to terms with the New York club and reported to camp.|$|E
25|$|Revis {{missed the}} {{majority}} of training camp and {{all four of the}} team's preseason contests while <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a new contract. He was to receive approximately $1 million in the fourth year of a six-year contract. On September 5, an agreement was reached on a four-year $32 million guaranteed contract, and Revis subsequently reported to camp the next day, a week before the team's season opener.|$|E

On 29 September 2009, it was reported that McAllister would become Portsmouth assistant manager, but he couldn't agree a deal with the club.|$|E
25|$|On 26 January 2007, Falkirk {{turned down}} an {{improved}} bid from Gow's boyhood heroes Rangers for the striker. While the first offer was £100,000, Falkirk manager John Hughes {{was said to have}} been <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> £500,000 in the hope of selling him before he could leave on a free transfer in the summer. After failed late attempts to sign Gow before the January transfer window closed, Rangers signed him for three years on a pre-contract agreement for him to join the club in the summer.|$|E
