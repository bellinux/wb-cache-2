40|$|Botswana has, for {{the past}} two decades, used <b>import</b> <b>controls</b> (permits) to {{regulate}} horticultural imports, and thereby promote economic diversification through import substitution. This article estimates import demand equations to capture the impact of <b>import</b> <b>controls</b> on horticultural <b>imports</b> (oranges, potatoes, and onions) into Botswana, using data for 1974 to 2001. Parameter estimates are used to compute nominal protection rates (NPRs) and welfare effects. Model-generated NPRs are estimated at 191 %, 75 %, and 109 % for oranges, potatoes, and onions, respectively. Imports of oranges, potatoes, and onions declined by 32 %, 29 %, and 35 %, respectively, due to the implementation of <b>import</b> <b>controls.</b> Over time consumer losses and quota rents rose while producer gains declined. Net social losses also increased, implying that <b>import</b> <b>controls</b> became increasingly burdensome. It is argued that <b>import</b> <b>controls</b> have not been very effective in promoting import substitution. The study is important for the trade liberalization debate in the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and within the Southern African Development Community (SADC), where import permits and other nontariff barriers are pervasive, have proliferated, and are a major hindrance to intraregional trade.

30|$|The adverse {{consequences}} {{associated with}} the use of organochlorine pesticides are the reasons why many of them were banned or have their use restricted (Botwe et al. 2012; Asiedu 2013). However, there are evidence of their continuous usage in some developing countries, such as Ghana, due to their efficacy and low cost and possibly due to weak <b>import</b> <b>control</b> and lack of logistics to monitor pesticides (Darko and Acquaah 2007; Asiedu 2013). In the past few years, a number of studies have shown the presence of organochlorine pesticide residues in fish (Darko et al. 2008) water and sediments (Ntow 2001; Darko et al. 2008; Kuranchie-Mensah et al. 2012), fruits and vegetables (Bempah and Donkor 2011; Bempah et al. 2011), meat (Darko and Acquaah 2007) and human fluids (blood and breast milk) (Ntow 2001; William et al. 2008; Tutu et al. 2011) in Ghana.|$|E

The analysis shows that Kenya has been importing GM grains {{for the past few years}} and that border control under pending regulation will be difficult and costly. While the Protocol's information requirement's “may contain” option does not require too much effort, implementing the strict “does contain” option will significantly increase the cost of trade and potentially the price of grains in Kenya. These results suggest that a regional approach to <b>import</b> <b>control</b> is necessary, and that Kenya should reconsider its support to the “does contain” option of the Protocol...|$|E
