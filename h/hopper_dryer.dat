50|$|Polyamide-imide resin is hygroscopic, {{and picks}} up ambient moisture. Before {{processing}} the resin, drying is required to avoid brittle parts, foaming, and other molding problems. The resin must be dried to a moisture content of 500 ppm or less. A desiccant dryer capable of maintaining a dew point of -40 °F (-40 °C) is recommended. If drying is done in pans or trays, put the resin in layers no more than 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) deep in drying trays. Dry for 24 hours at 250 °F, or 16 hours at 300 °F, or 8 hours at 350 °F. If drying at 350 °F (177 °C), limit drying time to 16 hours. For the injection molding press,a desiccant <b>hopper</b> <b>dryer</b> is recommended. The circulating air suction pipe {{should be at the}} base of the hopper, as near the feed throat as possible.|$|E
50|$|Grain {{damage is}} a broad term {{that is used to}} {{describe}} any degradation in the quality of grain. In the current grain trade, this damage can affect price, feed quality, food product quality, and susceptibility to pest contamination. Between the field and the end use, grain may go through any number of handling operations which can each contribute to grain damage. For example, grain might encounter free fall, conveyors, spouts, grain throwers, elevators, <b>hoppers,</b> <b>dryers,</b> and many more. Overall, these handling methods can be evaluated as to what effect they have on the grain. Damaged grain can often be characterized by {{the extent to which it}} reduces storage time. For example, cracked or broken kernels are more susceptible to insect or bacteria as well as chemical degradation. The damage to the actual grain is only one example of losses incurred after harvest. In order to quantify grain damage, one must also understand grain quality. Grain quality is a very broad term and can relate to many topics such as foreign material, chemical compositions, mechanical damage, insect infestations, and many more. These references to quality are highly dependent on the end use of the grain. Certain types of damage may be acceptable to specific industries, whereas others cannot use grain with these issues.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the quality of soybean seeds with high level of mechanical damages from different processing stages and stored with and without fungicide treatment. Collections of seed samples were performed during the processing at the following points: <b>hopper,</b> pre-cleaning, <b>dryer,</b> cleaning, spiral, sieve-classifier and the gravity table. The experimental design was completely randomized in a 9 x 2 factorial scheme, with 9 collection points and two seed treatments, in four replicates. The seeds were then evaluated immediately after processing and {{after six months of}} storage. The processing progressively improved the attributes of soybean seed quality throughout the different stages in which the gravity table {{plays an important role in}} the improvement of the physiological and sanitary quality of the lot, favoring the storage potential and vigor of the seeds. The treatment of the seeds with fungicides is effective in controlling fungi before and after storage. The storage of soybean seeds with high level of mechanical damage markedly increases their deterioration...|$|R
