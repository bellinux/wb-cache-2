5|$|Hurricanes (or their remnants) {{occasionally}} track {{through the}} area in late summer and early fall, but are often weak {{by the time they}} reach Washington, partly due to the city's inland location. Flooding of the Potomac River, however, caused by a combination of high tide, storm surge, and runoff, has been <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> extensive property damage in the neighborhood of Georgetown.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> {{respiratory}} depression. In healthy humans, 0.15mg/kg of midazolam {{may cause}} respiratory depression, which is postulated to {{be a central}} nervous system (CNS) effect. When midazolam is administered in combination with fentanyl, the incidence of hypoxemia or apnea becomes more likely.|$|E
5|$|Those {{taking more}} than 4mg per day have an {{increased}} potential for dependence. This medication may cause withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt withdrawal or rapid tapering, which in some cases have been <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> seizures, as well as marked delirium similar to that produced by the anticholinergic tropane alkaloids of Datura (scopolamine and atropine). The discontinuation of this medication may also cause a reaction called rebound anxiety.|$|E

5|$|Topical tick {{medicines}} may be {{toxic to}} animals and humans. The synthetic pyrethroid insecticide Phenothrin {{in combination with}} the hormone analogue methoprene was a popular topical flea and tick therapy for felines. Phenothrin kills adult ticks, while methoprene kills eggs. However, some products have been withdrawn, while others are <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> adverse reactions.|$|E
5|$|AMPK {{probably}} {{also plays a}} role in increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, as metformin administration increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. AMPK is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. Some metabolic actions of metformin do appear to occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms; the metabolic actions of metformin in the heart muscle can occur independent of changes in AMPK activity and may be mediated by p38 MAPK- and PKC-dependent mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{health effects}} from {{volcanic}} ash fall are possible, as exposure to free crystalline silica is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> silicosis. Minerals {{associated with this}} include quartz, cristobalite and tridymite, which may all be present in volcanic ash. These minerals are described as ‘free’ silica as the SiO2 is not attached to another element {{to create a new}} mineral. However, magmas containing less than 58% SiO2 are thought to be unlikely to contain crystalline silica.|$|E
25|$|Asbestos {{was used}} {{throughout}} International Paper’s Corinth manufacturing plant. These companies never warned the International Paper workers that their asbestos products were dangerous, even though asbestos was <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>causes</b> illnesses {{as far back}} as the 1920s. As a result, many former employees of International Paper are being diagnosed with mesothelioma.|$|R

5|$|Drugs {{may cause}} or affect {{clitoral}} priapism. The drug trazodone is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> male priapism {{as a side}} effect, but {{there is only one}} documented report that it may have caused clitoral priapism, in which case discontinuing the medication may be a remedy. Additionally, nefazodone is documented to have caused clitoral engorgement, as distinct from clitoral priapism, in one case, and clitoral priapism can sometimes start as a result of, or only after, the discontinuation of antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
5|$|Egyptian vulture {{populations have}} {{declined}} {{in most parts}} of its range. In Europe and most of the Middle East, populations in 2001 were half of those from 1980. In India, the decline has been rapid with a 35% decrease each year since 1999. In 1967–70, the area around Delhi was estimated to have 12,000–15,000 of these vultures, with an average density of about 5 pairs per 10km2. The exact cause of the decline is not known, but has been linked {{with the use of the}} NSAID Diclofenac, which has been <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> death in Gyps vultures.|$|E
5|$|Rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, and astrovirus are <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> viral {{gastroenteritis}}. Rotavirus is {{the most}} common cause of gastroenteritis in children, and produces similar rates in both the developed and developing world. Viruses cause about 70% of episodes of infectious diarrhea in the pediatric age group. Rotavirus is a less common cause in adults due to acquired immunity. Norovirus is the cause in about 18% of all cases.|$|E

5|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) {{is caused}} by a new type of coronavirus. Other coronaviruses were <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> mild infections in humans, so the virulence and rapid spread of this novel virus strain caused alarm among health professionals as well as public fear. The fears of a major pandemic were not realised, and by July 2003, after causing around 8,000 cases and 800 deaths, the outbreak had ended. The exact origin of the SARS virus is not known, but evidence suggests that it came from bats.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson and Suwannee points, {{found in}} Florida and the Southeastern United States, {{are similar to}} the Golondrina in shape and age. The Dalton point, found in the central United States, shares a similar outline and basal corner auriculation with Golondrina, which may imply that {{they are part of a}} series. Identification is made by {{examination}} of the blade edges—Golondrina exhibits much less serration. The Meserve type has also been <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> confusion, as it is considered a resharpened variant of the Plainview and Golondrina types.|$|E
5|$|The Voyagers found aurora-like {{ultraviolet}} {{emissions of}} hydrogen at mid-latitudes in the atmosphere, and auroras at polar latitudes (above 65 degrees). The high-level auroral activity {{may lead to}} the formation of complex hydrocarbon molecules that are carried toward the equator. The mid-latitude auroras, which occur only in sunlit regions, remain a puzzle, since bombardment by electrons and ions, <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> auroras on Earth, occurs primarily at high latitudes. Both Voyagers measured the rotation of Saturn (the length of a day) at 10 hours, 39 minutes, 24 seconds.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycle}} of Urnula craterium allows for both an {{imperfect}} (making asexual spores, or conidia) or perfect (making sexual spores) form; as has often happened in fungal taxonomy, the imperfect form was given a different name, because {{the relationship between the}} perfect and imperfect forms of the same species was not then known. The imperfect stage of Urnula craterium is the plant pathogenic species Conoplea globosa, <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> a canker disease (Strumella canker) of oak and several other hardwoods.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no natural}} source for green food colorings {{which has been}} {{approved}} by the US Food and Drug Administration. Chlorophyll, the E numbers E140 and E141, is the most common green chemical found in nature, and only allowed in certain medicines and cosmetic materials. Quinoline Yellow (E104) is a commonly used coloring in the United Kingdom but is banned in Australia, Japan, Norway and the United States. Green S (E142) is prohibited in many countries, for it is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> hyperactivity, asthma, urticaria, and insomnia.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{designed}} to be used with the QUAD II, 303, or 405 power amplifiers with limiters, a power amplifier capable of delivering 15 watts per channel suffices – excessive voltage input is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> arcing within the speaker panels. In fact, the instructions book states that any properly-regulated amplifier delivering no more than 33V is unlikely to cause damage to the speaker. Electrostatic speakers are more accurately rated by voltage, not power. In the ESL's case, at the rated nominal impedance of 16 ohms, the limit of 33 volts would be reached when the amplifier's power output reaches 15 watts (if it were driving a conventional load).|$|E

5|$|Lead, one of {{the leading}} causes of {{toxicity}} in waterfowl, has been <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> die-offs of wild bird populations. When hunters use lead shot, waterfowl such as ducks can ingest the spent pellets later and be poisoned; predators that eat these birds are also at risk. Lead shot-related waterfowl poisonings were first documented in the US in the 1880s. By 1919, the spent lead pellets from waterfowl hunting was positively identified as the source of waterfowl deaths. Lead shot has been banned for hunting waterfowl in several countries, including the US in 1991 and Canada in 1997. Other threats to wildlife include lead paint, sediment from lead mines and smelters, and lead weights from fishing lines. Lead in some fishing gear has been banned in several countries.|$|E
5|$|Lutetium has no {{biological}} role as well, but it {{is found}} even in the highest known organism, the humans, concentrating in bones, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the liver and kidneys. Lutetium salts are <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> metabolism and they occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature; the element is the least abundant in the human body of all lanthanides. Human diets have not been monitored for lutetium content, so it is not known how much the average human takes in, but estimations show the amount is only about several micrograms per year, all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants. Soluble lutetium salts are mildly toxic, but insoluble ones are not. Lanthanum is not essential for humans and has a low to moderate level of toxicity. However, it is essential for the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, although the general similarity of the rare earths means that it may be substituted by some of the other early lanthanides with no ill effects.|$|E
5|$|Owing {{to their}} wood-eating habits, many termite species can do great damage to {{unprotected}} buildings and other wooden structures. Their habit of remaining concealed {{often results in}} their presence being undetected until the timbers are severely damaged, leaving {{a thin layer of}} a wall that protects them from the environment. Of the 3,106 species known, only 183 species cause damage; 83 species cause significant damage to wooden structures. In North America, nine subterranean species are pests; in Australia, 16 species have an economic impact; in the Indian subcontinent 26 species are considered pests, and in tropical Africa, 24. In Central America and the West Indies, there are 17 pest species. Among the termite genera, Coptotermes has the highest number of pest species of any genus, with 28 species <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> damage. Less than 10% of drywood termites are pests, but they infect wooden structures and furniture in tropical, subtropical and other regions. Dampwood termites only attack lumber material exposed to rainfall or soil.|$|E
