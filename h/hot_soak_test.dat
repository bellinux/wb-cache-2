40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{determine}} the state of technology of pollutant emissions from 50 types of motorcycles, and {{on the basis of the}} measurements carried out to estimate the potential for reducing emissions with a view to future limit values. The vehicles tested were distributed between the various categories of vehicle on the basis of the figures for new registrations in the years 1996, 1997 and the first half of 1998 supplied by the Federal Motor Vehicle Office. The vehicle types were selected on the basis amongst other things of the statistics ('league table') of the Industrieverband Motorrad Deutschland e. V (IVM). For the categories light motorcycles and motorcycles the programme of investigation included gaseous emission measurements as per ECE Regulation 40 and the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) for passenger cars. Mopeds were tested in accordance with ECE Regulation 47 and at full power. Motorcycles with lambda-regulated catalytic converters were in addition subjected to gaseous emission testing carried out by analogy with the test regulations applying to passenger cars with lambda-regulated catalytic converters. For 10 selected vehicles, evaporative emissions were determined by the SHED test (1 -hour <b>hot</b> <b>soak</b> <b>test</b> and 24 -hour tank breathing test). In one exemplary calculation, a motorcycle was found to have four-and-a-half times the fuel consumption (in relation to its engine size and tare weight) of a small car. Evaporative emissions can be reduced by at least 76 % by the introduction of a limit value of 2 g HC. The introduction of gaseous emission testing for motorcycles would ensure that the CO limit at idling speed applied in the type-approval test would also be maintained in service. Where limit values are exceeded, adjustments to the engine are successful in 97 % of cases. (orig.)

40|$|Despite recent {{development}} in integration technologies for biomedical implantable devices, current state-of-the-art prosthetic platforms still lack {{a reliable and}} convenient packaging scheme to integrate high-density signal-driving chips, wireless telemetry circuitries and noise-canceling amplifiers, mainly due to the limitations in fabrication technology, material compatibility and interconnect reliability. In this dissertation, new packaging technologies are developed and presented to enable {{a new generation of}} flexible neural implants. These technologies can also house integrated circuit chips and provide high-density electrical connection to it. This packaging scheme utilizes the parylene-metal-parylene skin structure and can be totally integrated and be monolithically fabricated with existing functional devices. The size and the electrode patterns can be modified to suit different chips and applications. Integration with flexible cable integrated silicon probes for neural prosthesis, implantable muscle stimulators and implantable RFID tagging technology are all successfully demonstrated in this dissertation. Other discrete components can also be integrated to achieve high level functionality. In order to ensure the long-term stability of such packaging scheme, accelerated <b>hot</b> saline <b>soaking</b> <b>test</b> is conducted on the overall structure and its components. Detailed adhesion enhancement techniques are also presented to improve its performances. A physical model of the flexible retinal implant is then tested in vivo {{during the course of the}} experiment. Finally, the high-density squeegee bonding technique is introduced, which allows the integration of a 256 -channel chip. Functionality of the chip has been demonstrated. As a result, this technology has the potential to achieve ultra high lead count connection and can facilitate future research in flexible implantable biodevices. ...|$|R

40|$|CD-ROM included; A thesis {{submitted}} to the Department of Chemical and Process Engineering for the MSc in Chemical and Process EngineeringParboiling is a widely used paddy processing method where paddy is soaked in water to hydrate before the subsequent steaming, drying and milling operations. A significant amount of water is used in this soaking operation which is then discharged as wastewater. The continuous discharge of this wastewater has become an environmental concern in the paddy parboiling industry in Sri Lanka. In this study important characteristics of the effluent generated from two existing paddy soaking operations practiced in Sri Lanka namely <b>hot</b> <b>soaking</b> and cold soaking were initially determined. This analysis was done for wastewater resulting from soaking two rice varieties available locally, namely LD 356 a red rice and BG 300 which is a white rice. Characterization study showed pollutant levels higher in paddy soak wastewater than the stipulated local discharge standards (Appendix C). Wastewater generated from both <b>hot</b> <b>soaking</b> and cold soaking of red rice variety showed relatively higher COD and BOD values compared to those of wastewater from white rice variety. <b>Hot</b> <b>soaking</b> wastewater had higher COD and BOD values than cold soaking wastewater. The wastewater generated from <b>hot</b> <b>soaking</b> of red rice which showed higher pollutant strength is further studied for pollutant removalmethods. Biological treatment methods such as aerobic, anaerobic and physical treatment methods such as coagulation and adsorption were investigated. Removal of pollutants by aquatic plants and biological treatment using various microbial seeding sources such as cow dung, rice straw, pond water and paddy field soil were also studied. Results show that microbial sources from pond water and paddy field soil were able to reduce COD in soak wastewater by 96 % and 94 % respectively at pH 8 under aerobic and dark conditions. Combined treatment of anaerobic digestion and coagulation was able to reduce 94 % COD while the combination of adsorption and coagulation reduced COD by 92 %.

40|$|Rice is {{the most}} popular food in Sri Lanka where {{approximately}} 70 % of the paddy production goes through the parboiling process. Parboiling process is a hydrothermal treatment method. This treatment process consumes energy, water and other environmental resources and adds air and solid emissions, effluents and wastages back to environment which cause adverse environmental impacts. Total environmental input and output emissions of the parboiling process depend on the selected treatment method and the type of equipment used. Therefore the total environmental effects of each and every step in the life cycle of the production process needs to be considered in order to identify the most environmental friendly paddy parboiling method. The overall objective of this work is to assess environmental impacts of different parboiled paddy production methods adopted in Sri Lanka by using life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. LCA is a methodological context to estimate the environmental effects caused by the life cycle of a product, service or process. Goal and scope definition, life cycle inventory analysis, life cycle impact assessment and interpretation are the four major steps in LCA methodology. The environmental performance of three parboiling methods named as modern method with <b>hot</b> <b>soaking</b> and mechanical drying, modern method with <b>hot</b> <b>soaking</b> and sun drying and semi modern method with cold soaking and sun drying were assessed and compared quantitatively and qualitatively. Processes from paddy harvesting to rice cooking are included in the system boundary. According to the results, highest impact of parboiled rice production is given by the cooking step. The highest impacts from cold soaking operation method were observed in eutrophication, depletion of abiotic resources and climate change impact categories.

Parylene has been an ISO 10933 and USP Class VI certiﬁed biocompatible material. Parylene serves as the substrate and protective coating of the implantable electronic systems developed in this work.

The thin ﬁlm pentacene transistor uses Parylene as the ﬂexible substrate, the gate insulator and the protective coating. Studies of parylene surface are carried out.

To evaluate the long term reliability and stability of the thin ﬁlm pentacene transistors, saline <b>soaking</b> <b>tests</b> are performed. The results are less than satisfactory. In addition, thin ﬁlm amorphous silicon is studied and thin ﬁlm amorphous silicon transistors are developed.
