The ion exchange reaction reached to the equilibrium within 24 hours. Copper sorption capacity of the clinoptilolite increased with <b>high</b> <b>solution</b> <b>pH,</b> <b>high</b> temperature, and low ionic strength. Conditioning of the raw clinoptilolite with NaOH and KOH provided 10. 4 and 10. 06 fold capacity increase re-spectively.

The reaction orders were independent of the pH in the range of 8. 5 - 10. 5 and the reagent concentration (1 - 4 wt %).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{aimed to}} examine and elucidate the effects of feed <b>solution</b> chemistry, including <b>pH</b> and ionic strength, and membrane fouling on the rejection of boron by different nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Membrane filtration experiments were conducted using a laboratory-scale cross-flow NF/RO membrane system and five different commercially available NF and RO membranes. The related rejection mechanisms were delineated {{on the basis of}} solution chemistry, membrane characteristics, and physiochemical properties of boric acid and model foulants. In every experiment, the rejection of conductivity and sodium were measured and compared with boron rejection data. The effects of membrane fouling on the performance of membrane system were evaluated by comparing the flux behaviours of the fouled membranes after 18 hour, and the quality of permeate produced by the virgin and fouled membranes. Results reported here showed that <b>solution</b> <b>pH</b> appeared to be an important factor governing the rejection of boron by NF/RO membranes under both virgin and fouled conditions. Increasing <b>solution</b> <b>pH</b> led to an increase in boron rejection efficiency. The key role of <b>solution</b> <b>pH</b> in determining boron rejection efficiency was attributed to its influence on membrane charged properties and the speciation of boric acid, which could increase the rejection by both size exclusion and charged repulsion mechanisms. However, the influence of <b>solution</b> <b>pH</b> on membrane surface charged properties could be inhibited by the fouling layer, which resulted in a lower boron rejection by fouled membranes than that by virgin membranes under <b>high</b> <b>pH</b> conditions. <b>Solution</b> <b>pH</b> could also determine the impact of solution ionic strength on boron rejection efficiency. Increasing ionic strength was found to improve boron rejection in some certain conditions. However, this effect was observed only at pH values that higher than the intrinsic pKa of boric acid. The implication of this finding was that in double-pass membrane desalination systems where boron rejection was achieved at the second pass, the rejection can be improved by allowing a higher salt passage through the first pass. Boron rejection by NF/RO membranes in fouled conditions revealed that different types of membrane fouling could induce different effects on the permeate flux behaviour and the separation of boron. Humic acid and sodium alginate fouling layer caused the most severe permeate flux decline, followed by silica colloid and CaSO 4 scaling. Humic acid was the only model foulant investigated in this study could enhance boron rejection, especially at low <b>solution</b> <b>pH.</b> Possible factors that could influence boron rejection by fouled membranes included the extent of cake-enhanced concentration polarisation, charged property of foulant, and foulant‟s ability to clog the membrane surface. Membrane pore size appeared to be a reliable parameter that determined the solute rejection efficiency of a membrane because membrane pore size was not affected by solution chemistry such as pH and ionic strength. Overall, solute rejection efficiency of a tighter membrane would be less affected by any changes in solution chemistry, and also less affected by membrane fouling conditions. This finding suggested a possibility of using NF membranes under high pH conditions to increase boron rejection for the second pass in double-pass membrane desalination plants. The utilisation of NF membrane could avoid over-demineralisation of the final product water, reduce energy consumption, and also decrease the potential of membrane scaling at <b>high</b> <b>solution</b> <b>pH...</b>|$|R

This study evaluated the reactivity of nZVI to the co-contaminants and by-product formation, employed different catalysts to reduce nitrite yield from nitrate, and examined the transformation of nZVI after reaction. Nitrate reduction resulted in <b>high</b> <b>solution</b> <b>pH,</b> negatively charged surface of nZVI, formation of Fe 3 O 4 (a stable transformation of nZVI), and no release of ionic iron. Increased pH and negative charge contributed to significant increase in Cd(II) removal capacity (from 40 mg/g to 188 mg/g) with nitrate present. In addition, nitrate reduction by nZVI could be catalyzed by Cd(II) : while 30 % of nitrate was reduced by nZVI within 2 h {{in the absence of}} Cd(II), complete nitrate reduction was observed in the presence of 40 mg-Cd/L due to the formation of Cd islands (Cd(0) and CdO) on the nZVI particles. While nitrate was reduced mostly to ammonium when Cd(II) was not present or at Cd(II) concentrations≥ 40 mg/L, up to 20 % of the initial nitrate was reduced to nitrite at Cd(II) concentrations < 40 mg/L.

40|$|In this study, Ag⁺-imprinted thiourea/glutaraldehyde grafted O-carboxymethyl {{chitosan}} (ITG-OCMC) {{beads and}} Ag⁺-imprinted glutaraldehyde-crosslinked chitosan (IGCC) gel beads were synthesized to selectively adsorb Ag⁺ from bimetallic aqueous solutions containing the same molar concentration of Ag⁺ and Cu²⁺. Surface imprinting {{technology has been}} applied to achieve extremely high selectivity for Ag⁺ on the prepared sorbents by generating recognizable binding sites. For the ITG-OCMC beads, experimental results indicated that high degree of carboxymethylation and low level of crosslinking would help to achieve higher uptake capacity of Ag⁺. The maximum uptake of Ag⁺ was found to be 156. 32 mg g⁻¹ at 40. 0 °C with an initial Ag⁺ concentration of 160. 50 mg L⁻¹ and the biosorbent dosage of 1. 0000 g L⁻¹. Langmuir isotherm and Lagergren’s pseudo-second-order kinetics can be used to describe the sorption process of Ag⁺. Analyses from FTIR and XPS confirmed that selective adsorption of Ag⁺ took place on the surfaces of ITG-OCMC beads by chelation through >C=S, amine, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. For the IGCC beads, the maximum uptake of Ag⁺ by the ion-imprinted chitosan beads was found to be 89. 200 mg g⁻¹ at 25. 0 °C with an initial Ag⁺ concentration of 352. 95 mg L⁻¹ and the biosorbent dosage of 1. 0000 g L⁻¹. The adsorption equilibrium and kinetics of Ag⁺ by IGCC beads can be better described by Langmuir isotherm and the intraparticle diffusion model. FTIR and XPS analyses suggested that amine functional groups involve the binding of Ag⁺ via complexation at <b>higher</b> <b>solution</b> <b>pH</b> (3. 0 ≤ pH ≤ 5. 0) and ion exchange at lower solution pH (1. 0 ≤ pH < 3. 0) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{optimize}} the reduction and removal of chromium from aqueous solutions by a biosorption system consisting of a bacteria supported on a zeolite. The system proposed combines the biosorption properties of Arthrobacter viscosus, with the ion exchange capacity of NaY zeolite. Experiments were also performed without the zeolite for comparison purposes. Experimental parameters such as solution pH, biomass concentration and initial Cr(VI) concentration were investigated {{in order to assess}} their influence on the biosorption system. The results revealed that chromium biosorption was highly pH dependent. The lower pH values favored Cr(VI) reduction, while <b>higher</b> <b>solution</b> <b>pH</b> enhanced total chromium removal. After the optimization of the parameters in study, the highest content of chromium in the zeolite (0. 9 %) and best uptake (13. 0 mgCr/gzeolite) were obtained for the experiment at pH 4, biomass concentration of 5 g L− 1 and initial Cr(VI) concentration of 100 mg L− 1. After the biosorption process, the samples were characterized by chemical analyses (ICP-AES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS spectra of bacteria revealed that the chromium loaded on the biomass surface was in the trivalent form. Dr. C. S. Rodriguez (C. A. C. T.

40|$|In this study, a nano-class TiO 2 /Ti {{thin-film}} electrode {{was made}} using the atmospheric pressure {{chemical vapor deposition}} (APCVD). The electrode was combined with an external circuit and anode bias to study the efficiencies of silver ions reduction and acetic acid decomposition. Results of SEM images and XRD patterns of the TiO 2 /Ti thin-film electrode surface show that the thin-film electrode made using the APCVD method can be as size as 30 nm with the TiO 2 photoelectric catalyst in anatase crystal form. More obvious agglomeration of TiO 2 particles was observed for shorter APCVD sprayed times. Results of the light response study show that the electrode has a rapid response time to 365 nm UV light to produce electricity with 7 mu A/cm(2) density. Additionally, results of the photocatalytic studies using the electrode combined with an external circuit in the photoelectrical catalytic studies to reduce silver ions reveal that with a reaction time of 180 min, the photocatalytic process will reduce 70 % of silver ions in high-concentrated solution (1000 mg/l as Ag) and 93 % silver ions in low-concentrated solution (108 mg/l as Ag). When the irradiation time is extended to 240 min, the silver reduction efficiency {{is as high as}} 99. 8 %. <b>Higher</b> <b>solution</b> <b>pH</b> is favorable to the photoelectrical reduction of silver while the anode bias does not benefit the silver reduction efficiency but favors the decomposition of acetic acid. However, the process decomposes less than 10 % of acetic acid. The external circuit will transmit the photo-generated electrons to the cathode surface thus reducing the combination of electron and holes at the anode surface. As the reduction of precious metals is concerned, the external circuit is capable of avoiding the metal deposition at the catalyst surface to cause catalyst poison or light shielding that are know to reduce the photo utilization efficiency.

30|$|Depending on the {{production}} temperatures, all types of ACP are divided into two major groups: low-temperature ACPs (prepared in solutions, usually aqueous ones) and high-temperature ACPs (Dorozhkin 2012 c). Low-temperature ACPs (described by the chemical formula Ca x H y (PO 4) z ·nH 2 O, n =  3 – 4.5; 15 – 20  % H 2 O) are often encountered as a transient precursor phase during precipitation of other CaPO 4 in aqueous systems. Usually, an ACP is the first phase precipitated from supersaturated <b>solutions</b> (the <b>higher</b> supersaturation, the better) prepared by rapid mixing of solutions containing ions of calcium and orthophosphate (Elliott 1994; Dorozhkin 2012 c). Such ACP precipitates usually look like spherical particles with diameters in the range 200 – 1200  Å without a definite structure. Generally, the ACP particles are smaller if prepared under conditions of high supersaturation and/or high pH, while for a given pH, higher temperatures give larger particles (Blumenthal et al. 1972). The freshly precipitated ACPs contain 10 – 20  % by weight of tightly bound water, which is removed by vacuum drying at elevated temperature (Posner and Betts 1975). The amorphization degree of ACPs increases with the concentration increasing of Ca- and PO 4 -containing solutions, {{as well as at}} a <b>high</b> <b>solution</b> <b>pH</b> and a low crystallization temperature. A continuous gentle agitation of as precipitated ACPs in the mother solution, especially at elevated temperatures, results in a slow recrystallization and formation of better crystalline CaPO 4, such as CDHA (LeGeros 1991; Elliott 1994). In addition, other production techniques of ACPs are known (Dorozhkin 2012 c).|$|R
40|$|N-Viro Soil (NVS) is an alkaline-stabilized {{municipal}} biosolid {{that has}} been shown to lower population densities and reduce egg hatch of Heterodera glycines and other plant-parasitic nematodes; but the mechanism(s) of nematode suppression of this soil amendment are unknown. This study sought to identify NVS-mediated changes in soil chemical properties and their impact upon H. glycines and Meloidogyne incognita mortality. N-Viro Soil was applied to sand in laboratory assays at 0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, 2. 0 %, and 3. 0 % dry w/w with a nonamended treatment as a control. Nematode mortality and changes in sand-assay chemical properties were determined 24 hours after incubation. Calculated lethal concentration (LC 90) values were 1. 4 % w/w NVS for second-stage juveniles of both nematode species and 2. 6 and > 3. 0 % w/w NVS for eggs of M. incognita and H. glycines, respectively. Increasing rates of NVS were strongly correlated (r² = 0. 84) with <b>higher</b> sand <b>solution</b> <b>pH</b> levels. Sand <b>solution</b> <b>pH</b> levels and, to a lesser extent, the production of ammonia appeared to be the inorganic chemical-mediated factors responsible for killing plant-parasitic nematodes following amendment with NVS...|$|R
40|$|Summary – N-Viro Soil (NVS) is an alkaline-stabilised biosolid {{that has}} been shown to {{suppress}} Meloidogyne incognita. In separate microplot studies, NVS was applied either alone at different rates (0, 25, 50, 75, 100 dry t ha− 1), or in combination with M. incognita-resistant and M. incognita-susceptible cultivars, to different M. incognita initial densities (0, 37 500, 75 000 eggs/microplot). NVS suppressed M. incognita. During year 1, increasing rates of NVS resulted in <b>higher</b> soil <b>solution</b> <b>pH</b> and greater M. incognita J 2 and egg suppression. Soil <b>solution</b> <b>pH</b> remained <b>higher</b> in NVS-amended plots compared to the unamended control in years 2 and 3. NVS was more effective in reducing moderate than in reducing high initial nematode populations, with 94 - 100 % reduction in egg and juvenile populations compared to 75 - 79 %, respectively. In all experiments, a reduction in nematode populations by NVS, alone or in combination with a resistant cultivar, did not occur consistently in years 2 or 3. Unfortunately, the application rate of NVS required to achieve this reduction in nematode populations is probably not agronomically realistic. Additional research may allow the rate of NVS required to suppress plant-parasitic nematodes to be reduced...|$|R
