50|$|A {{variety of}} {{fillings}} {{have been used}} in shells throughout history. An <b>incendiary</b> <b>shell</b> was invented by Valturio in 1460. The carcass shell was first used by the French under Louis XIV in 1672. Initially in the shape of an oblong in an iron frame (with poor ballistic properties) it evolved into a spherical shell. Their use continued well into the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|A modern {{version of}} the <b>incendiary</b> <b>shell</b> was {{developed}} in 1857 by the British and was known as Martin's shell after its inventor. The shell was filled with molten iron and was intended to break up on impact with an enemy ship, splashing molten iron on the target. It {{was used by the}} Royal Navy between 1860 and 1869, replacing Heated shot as an anti-ship, incendiary projectile.|$|E
50|$|Experimental {{vehicle with}} the turret {{replaced}} by fixed heavy mortar intended to fire 25 lb TNT <b>incendiary</b> <b>shells</b> to demolish concrete emplacements. Trials {{only by the}} Petroleum Warfare Dept, 1943-45. Effective range was 400 yd (maximum range 2000 yd).|$|R
2500|$|New {{types of}} shell were {{introduced}} during the First World War. [...] These were chemical {{at the end}} of 1915, <b>incendiary</b> <b>shells</b> in 1916 and smoke shells in 1917. [...] Smoke shells were phosphorus filled with both steel and cast iron bodies.|$|R
50|$|Recently, APIS (armour {{piercing}} <b>incendiary</b> <b>shells)</b> {{have been}} used; these penetrate the target using the kinetic {{properties of the}} round before the incendiary round goes off, smothering the crew in flames, cooking off ammunition and igniting combustible materials, generally destroying the target.|$|R
50|$|Other {{types of}} shell were also introduced, {{although}} not as extensively as they were for howitzers and heavier guns. White phosphorus smoke shells became available in small quantities in 1916, and in 1918 chemical and incendiary shells were provided. The latter was a shrapnel type shell using thermite pellets, although a black powder <b>incendiary</b> <b>shell</b> for AA use against Zeppelins was introduced in 1916.|$|E

5000|$|The First World War {{marked a}} {{profound}} {{break in the}} history of the library. On May 3, 1917, an <b>incendiary</b> <b>shell</b> destroyed the town hall and a large part of the collections. The most valuable works (nearly 100 000 documents) were put away before the War and thus preserved from any damage. In 1918, the city of Reims was devastated.

50|$|Similar to <b>incendiary</b> <b>shells</b> were star shells, {{designed}} for illumination rather than arson. Sometimes called lightballs {{they were in}} use from the 17th Century onwards. The British adopted parachute lightballs in 1866 for 10, 8 and 5 inch calibres. The 10-inch wasn't officially declared obsolete until 1920.|$|R

5000|$|With the gun {{no longer}} wanted in the trenches, {{it was decided to}} adapt it for use on {{aircraft}} as an air-to-air weapon against airships and observation balloons and for use against ground targets such as trains, ammunition dumps, and tanks. When mounted aboard aircraft, the gun could fire incendiary, armor-piercing, and high-explosive cartridges. The <b>incendiary</b> <b>shell</b> in flight emitted very hot flames from two openings in its base, which made it look as if the gun had fired a rocket; this led to the guns misleading but widely used popular name of [...] "Vickers-Crayford rocket gun." ...|$|E
5000|$|Thereafter, since Essex had {{sustained}} {{only minor}} damage, Porter kept her on station patrolling the lower Mississippi River between Vicksburg and Baton Rouge. On 5 August, his ship and [...] assisted Union Army troops in repelling a Confederate land attack on Baton Rouge. The following morning, he headed north to Vicksburg to confront Arkansas once more. He found his quarry on {{a bend in}} the river, close to the shore. In the ensuing bombardment, Porter used an <b>incendiary</b> <b>shell</b> which he himself had invented. After about 20 minutes of shelling, Arkansas erupted into flames and soon blew up. Evidence suggests that the Confederate crew had set their own ship afire to prevent her capture. Be that as it may, Porter's bold action played no small part in the ram's destruction. Moreover, Congress recognized the role played by Porter and his ship in June 1864 when they belatedly awarded the Essex crew $25,000 in prize money.|$|E
50|$|In the 17th century during sieges, armies {{attempted}} to start fires by launching <b>incendiary</b> <b>shells</b> filled with sulfur, tallow, rosin, turpentine, saltpeter, and/or antimony. Even when fires were not started, the resulting smoke and fumes provided a considerable distraction. Although their primary function was never abandoned, {{a variety of}} fills for shells were developed to maximize {{the effects of the}} smoke.|$|R
5000|$|The ironclad was {{developed}} {{as a result of}} the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or <b>incendiary</b> <b>shells</b> as demonstrated by the Russian destruction of a Turkish squadron at the Battle of Sinope.

50|$|Sarajevo {{also holds}} {{many of the}} most famous {{historical}} texts in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They were largely held in the Sarajevo City (and University) Library that was built in 1896. Unfortunately Serbian ultranationalists purposely fired upon the building with <b>incendiary</b> <b>shells.</b> They succeeded in setting the building on fire, and along with it thousands of irreplaceable texts. Today an international effort is underway to replace what was lost.|$|R
50|$|Readily {{recognized}} by its long slender gun barrel and split carriage trail, the Type 92 10 cm Cannon was designed particularly for long-range fire. The recoil system was hydropneumatic {{and it had}} a distinctive three-step interrupted thread breechblock. It fired a 35 lb shell up to14200 yd with standard high-explosive shells, and also had provision for special long-range shells that could reach 20000 yd 20,000 yards, as well as chemical, armor-piercing, smoke and <b>incendiary</b> <b>shells.</b>|$|R
50|$|The gun fired either high {{explosive}} or <b>incendiary</b> shrapnel <b>shells</b> that weighed 20.6 kilograms, {{with a complete}} round weighing 32.4 kilograms.|$|R
50|$|Occasionally HEIs {{were used}} against tanks (heavily armored) and also lightly {{armoured}} vehicles, but, since {{the invention of}} modern battle armour, such as Chobham, and Explosive Reactive Armour, these shells have become less and less practical for anti-tank work, and more useful for destroying “soft” targets such as air bases, trenches, or bunkers, {{in which they can}} create fires of over 1000 degrees Celsius. <b>Incendiary</b> <b>shells</b> are no longer in use by many countries, due to bans on the use of phosphorus weapons.|$|R
5|$|During the battle, Graham also {{saved the}} life of Captain Wyndham– {{one of those who}} had shut the gate– by {{shooting}} a sniper whose musket was trained on the officer. Mid-afternoon, a fire broke out in one of the farm buildings following a bombardment of <b>incendiary</b> <b>shells.</b> Graham's brother Joseph was lying wounded within, and Graham requested permission to fall out, so he might rescue his brother; given permission, he retrieved his brother and returned to his post. Joseph Graham died of wounds five days later.|$|R
500|$|On 15 July, {{the cruiser}} [...] arrived to relieve Yosemite, and the quickly {{finished}} off the Antonio Lopez {{the next day}} by firing twenty <b>incendiary</b> <b>shells</b> into the vessel and sinking it. Though Antonio Lopez had been sunk, her cargo was successfully delivered and ensured that any American assault on San Juan would be met with stronger resistance. Caamaño was awarded the [...] "Cruz de la Orden de Merito Naval" [...] (The Cross of the Order of the Naval Merit) by the Spanish government.|$|R
50|$|Ironclads are steam-propelled {{warships}} of {{the later}} 19th century, protected by iron or steel armor plates. The ironclad was developed {{as a result of}} the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or <b>incendiary</b> <b>shells.</b> The first ironclad battleship, , was launched by the French Navy in 1859; she prompted the British Royal Navy to start building ironclads. After the first clashes of ironclads took place during the American Civil War, it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored line-of-battle ship as the most powerful warship afloat.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Marsh Battery" [...] was {{completed}} on August 17, 1863, and stood ready for its armament. The [...] "Swamp Angel," [...] an 8-inch, 200 pound Parrott Rifle was positioned in the battery, and the 11th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment manned the weapon, firing <b>incendiary</b> <b>shells</b> {{at the city}} of Charleston from August 22-23 of 1863. After lobbing 35 shells into Charleston the Swamp Angel burst, and the battery was abandoned. Like Sumter before, Charleston held out under bombardment and did not capitulate until February 18, 1865.|$|R

2500|$|On August 21, 1863 Gillmore sent Confederate general P. G. T. Beauregard an {{ultimatum}} to abandon heavily fortified positions at Morris Island or {{the city of}} Charleston would be shelled. [...] When the positions were not evacuated within a few hours, Gillmore ordered the Parrott rifle to fire on the city. Between August 22 and August 23, the Swamp Angel fired on the city 36 times (the gun burst on the 36th round), using many <b>incendiary</b> <b>shells</b> which caused little damage and few casualties. The battle was made more famous by Herman Melville's poem [...]|$|R

50|$|Guns that fired {{explosive}} or <b>incendiary</b> <b>shells</b> were a {{major threat}} to wooden ships, and these weapons quickly became widespread after the introduction of 8 inch shell guns as part of the standard armament of French and American line-of-battle ships in 1841. In the Crimean War, six line-of-battle ships and two frigates of the Russian Black Sea Fleet destroyed seven Turkish frigates and three corvettes with explosive shells at the Battle of Sinop in 1853. Later in the war, French ironclad floating batteries used similar weapons against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn.|$|R
25|$|The ship did not {{immediately}} sink so U-96 fired again at 0805 and 0907hrs, hitting Almeda Star in the stern and again amidships. The ship had launched four lifeboats but still had people on deck when U-96 surfaced and opened fire on her with her 88mm deck gun. Between 0932 and 0948hrs the submarine fired 28 <b>incendiary</b> <b>shells,</b> about 15 of which hit Almeda Star and started small fires aboard. The fires soon went out so at 0955hrs U-96 hit the ship with a fourth torpedo, which exploded in her forepart. Within three minutes Almeda Star sank by her bow.|$|R
