5|$|After initiation, {{the child}} {{regularly}} visits the hospital outpatient clinic where {{he or she}} is seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks. A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital dietitian and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet. Urinary ketone levels are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect. This <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> <b>using</b> ketone test strips containing nitroprusside, which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).|$|E
5|$|Like other insects, {{grasshoppers}} {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} and their body cavities are filled with haemolymph. A heart-like structure in {{the upper part of}} the abdomen pumps the fluid to the head from where it percolates past the tissues and organs on its way back to the abdomen. This system circulates nutrients throughout the body and carries metabolic wastes to be excreted into the gut. Other functions of the haemolymph include wound healing, heat transfer and the provision of hydrostatic pressure, but the circulatory system is not involved in gaseous exchange. Respiration <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> <b>using</b> tracheae, air-filled tubes, which open at the surfaces of the thorax and abdomen through pairs of valved spiracles. Larger insects may need to actively ventilate their bodies by opening some spiracles while others remain closed, using abdominal muscles to expand and contract the body and pump air through the system.|$|E

25|$|Arthroscopy (also called arthroscopic or keyhole surgery) is a {{minimally}} invasive surgical procedure on a joint {{in which an}} examination and sometimes treatment of damage <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> <b>using</b> an arthroscope, an endoscope that is inserted into the joint through a small incision.

25|$|Most recently, technetium-99m {{scintigraphy}} {{has been}} combined with CT coregistration technology to produce SPECT/CT scans.

25|$|For example, for a current-{{feedback}} amplifier, current {{from the}} output is sampled for feedback and combined with current at the input. Therefore, the feedback ideally <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> <b>using</b> an (output) current-controlled current source (CCCS), and its imperfect realization using a two-port network also must incorporate a CCCS, that is, the appropriate choice for feedback network is a g-parameter two-port.

25|$|Clifford algebras {{have been}} applied in the problem of action {{recognition}} and classification in computer vision. Rodriguez et al. propose a Clifford embedding to generalize traditional MACH ﬁlters to video (3D spatiotemporal volume), and vector-valued data such as optical flow. Vector-valued data is analyzed using the Clifford Fourier Transform. Based on these vectors action filters are synthesized in the Clifford Fourier domain and recognition of actions <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> <b>using</b> Clifford Correlation. The authors demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} Clifford embedding by recognizing actions typically performed in classic feature ﬁlms and sports broadcast television.|$|E
25|$|GIA clarity grading is {{performed}} under 10x magnification with darkfield illumination. The GIA Laboratory uses as standard equipment binocular stereo microscopes which {{are able to}} zoom to higher magnifications. These microscopes are equipped with darkfield illumination, {{as well as an}} ultraviolet filtered overhead light. When grading <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> <b>using</b> a 10x handheld loupe, darkfield illumination is more difficult to achieve.

25|$|Laparoscopic surgery <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> <b>using</b> {{several small}} incisions, or ports: one to insert a {{surgical}} telescope {{connected to a}} video camera, and others to permit access of specialized operating instruments. The surgeon views the operation on a video screen. Laparoscopy is also called limited access surgery, reflecting the limitation on handling and feeling tissues and also the limited resolution and two-dimensionality of the video image. With experience, a skilled laparoscopic surgeon can perform most procedures as expeditiously as with an open incision—with the option of using an incision should the need arise.|$|E
