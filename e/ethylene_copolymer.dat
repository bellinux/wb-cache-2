Blends of various compositions were prepared using a corotating twin-screw extruder. The experimental results indicated that the dispersion of nanoparticles in (PP/EPR) depends on their surface (stearic acid and fatty acid coatings). In both cases, the final morphology is the core-shell structure in which EPR acts as the shell part encapsulating coated nano-CaCO 3. In this case, EPR-g-MAH copolymer does not improve the interface between (PP/EPR) and nanoparticles but PEP propylene <b>ethylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> should be preferentially localized at the interface of PP and (EPR/nano-CaCO 3) phases generating an improved adherence, which will ensure a better cohesion of the whole material.

The 2 D correlation patterns highlight relationships among multiple characteristics of structure evolution, particularly {{the extent to which}} separate features change simultaneously versus sequentially. By visualizing these relationships during cooling, evidence is obtained for two separate physical processes occurring in what is known as “irreversible crystallization” in random ethylene copolymers. Initial growth of primarily lamellae into unconstrained melt (“primary-irreversible crystallization”) is distinguished from subsequent secondary lamellae formation in the constrained, noncrystalline regions between the primary lamellae (“secondary-irreversible crystallization”). At successively lower temperatures (“reversible crystallization”), growth of the crystalline reflections is found to occur simultaneously with the change in shape of the amorphous halo, which is inconsistent with the formation of an additional phase. Rather, the synchronous character supports the view that growth of frustrated crystals distorts the adjacent noncrystalline material.

40|$|Polyolefins are an {{inexpensive}} class of compounds {{that can be}} used to prepare a plethora of different materials. Poly(ethylene) is the worldwide most produced polymer and is mostly synthesised by free radical polymerisation or catalytic coordination insertion using high temperature and pressure. The controlled radical polymerisation of ethylene is very difficult to achieve because of secondary reactions of this unconjugated monomer, e. g. chain transfer and termination reactions. Cobalt-mediated radical polymerisation (CMRP) represents a solution to control its polymerisation in mild conditions: in a reversible deactivation mechanism, a cobalt complex reversibly traps the active growing chains and converts them into dormant species, avoiding side reactions and allowing for a controlled polymerisation. Using CMRP, statistical copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate (VAc) have been synthesised, as well as block-like and block copolymers. Furthermore, functionalisation of the α- and ω-chain ends are now possible.

Carbon steel samples were prepared to simulate the surface composition and morphology of historic steel artefacts, and coated by a conservator-restorer following the common practices in conservation treatments. Three commercial organic coatings have been studied: a microcrystalline wax (RenaissanceTM) and a methyl acrylate/ethyl methacrylate copolymer resin (ParaloidTM B- 72) dissolved in acetone –both them commonly used in conservation and restoration treatments– and a <b>ethylene</b> <b>copolymer</b> wax emulsion in water (PoligenTM ES- 91009), that has not been used so far for this purposes. Four commercial corrosion inhibitor additives were added to the ParaloidTM B- 72 resin and PoligenTM ES- 91009 wax. The additives were commercial preparations with the following known active components: a blend of triazoles (M 435), an ammonium salt of tricarboxylic acid (M 370), a calcium sulphonate (M 109), and a bis-oxazoline (Alkaterge-TTM). Rp and EIS results showed that the best protection of the steel specimens was afforded by PoligenTM ES- 91009 when applied in thick layers.

Content of the form I in specimens was calculated by wide angle X-ray scattering during the phase transformation. Physical properties were measured via density changes of specimens and changes of mechanical properties were measured via tensile testing. From density measurements, {{it is obvious that}} the different thicknesses of compression-molded specimens do not influence the evolution of rate of the phase transformation. Densities of compression-molded and extrudates posses virtually the same values after the phase transformation. The evolution of the Form 1 content was confirmed by the trends, which were observed, via density measurements and by tensile testing in the evolution of tensile modulus. The evolution of tensile properties was carried out on extrudates and the results were consequently compared with the evolution of injection-molded specimens. From this observation it was found that values of moduli in extrudates are remarkably higher than in the injection-molded specimens. This is a consequence of different morphological structures, which have direct impact on mechanical properties and the phase transformation in PB- 1.

Crops such as wheat straw are renewable and low cost materials that, combined with thermoplastics such as polypropylene, provide engineering products with unique characteristics. The {{objective of this}} study was to investigate the influence of processing conditions and composite formulation in the final properties of the composites. For these purposes wheat straw fibres and polypropylene (PP) were compounded in a batch mixer under a number of different thermal conditions and formulations. Fiber loading in the range from 0 to 60 wt-% was examined and the individual effects of two coupling agents (maleic anhydride modified polypropylene and maleic acid <b>ethylene</b> <b>copolymer)</b> and a lubricant were also studied. Particle size, morphology, thermal and mechanical properties and water uptake behaviour were inspected with appropriate techniques. Wheat straw particle size distribution was studied through image analysis; distribution curves for length and width of the particles were recorded in two stages of the project: previous and after compounding the natural material with polypropylene. Morphology of wheat straw particles and wheat straw-polypropylene composites were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Thermal properties including melting temperature and crystallization temperature of composites and pure resin were obtained from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) performed on the samples; percentage of crystallinity was also calculated from the heat of fusion obtained from those tests. Mechanical properties, such as flexural modulus and flexural yield strength, were accessed in a miniature materials tester. Water absorption of selected composite samples was evaluated after immersion of the samples in a water bath. Water absorption curves were used to calculate the water diffusion coefficient (diffusivity) of the composites. Image analysis revealed the changes in the wheat straw structure due to shear forces during processing and improvement of adhesion between matrix and filler in compositions containing coupling agent. Small changes in the percentage of crystallinity of the thermoplastic phase were observed in all composites tested. Flexural tests revealed behaviour trends for the composites tested. Water uptake appeared to be a severe problem on natural fiber composites due to color fading, dimension instability and significant weight gains.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyolefins, such as high density polyethylene (HDPE), are important commodity polymers. PET is widely used for fibres and fllms but is also an attractive material for moulded products, owing to its high melting point and solvent resistance. Crystalline PET, however, is brittle and susceptible to hydrolytic degradation through water absorption. Polyolefins, on the other hand, are tough materials with low water absorption but have a relatively low melting point. Blending these two materials is expected to produce an attractive combination of properties. Blending PET with polyolefins, however, produces coarse microstructures and poor mechanical properties {{due to the lack}} of compatibility of the two polymers. Compatibility is expected to improve by reducing the interfacial tension and increasing the adhesion between the two phases; the first will reduce the size of the dispersed phase, while the latter would improve the mechanical properties. Compatibilisation of immiscible blends can be achieved by blending suitable functionalised polymers capable of reacting with the two components and/or by adding a compatibilising agent, e. g. block and graft copolymers with units along the main chains that are miscible and capable of strong interactions, such as H-bonds, with the two polymers in the blend. In the present work, polyhydroxyether of bisphenol A (phenoxy), which is known to be compatible with polyesters [1, 2] and anhydride/acid functionalised <b>ethylene</b> <b>copolymers,</b> i. e. copolymers and terpolymers of ethylene containing acrylic acid units or grafted maleic anhydride, as well as the corresponding sodium ionomers, were used as the base polymer components for the production of graft copolymer type of compatibilisers by reaction processing methods. Additives such as sodium ethoxide, sodium benzoate, sodium montanate and sodium p-toluene sulphonate were evaluated as reaction controller catalysts for potential interactions between the OH groups in the phenoxy and acid and/or anhydride groups in the <b>ethylene</b> <b>copolymers.</b> The extent of interactions between the compatibiliser components were characterised by solubility tests, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FITR), rheological properties and optical microscopy. The efficiency of the compatibilisers was studied on blends of PET with several grades of HDPE differing in molecular weights, by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), rheological properties, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and by measuring the mechanical properties. The results show that the type of graft copolymers or co-ionomers of phenoxy with acid functionalised <b>ethylene</b> <b>copolymers</b> can be made and that sodium ethoxide is an effective catalyst for the production of these types of compatibilisers. These systems were found to be a very efficient compatibiliser for PET/HDPE blends as they produce fme dispersions and improve the mechanical properties. A correlation is found between the efficiency of the compatibilisers and the melt viscosity of the final blends. Furthermore this work has revealed that the further addition of sodium ethoxide to ionomers and ionomer based compatibilisers enhances considerably the nucleation of PET in the blend...|$|R
