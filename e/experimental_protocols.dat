5|$|Bishop's work {{evolved to}} include studies of drug {{resistance}} {{in both the}} parasites and the host organisms, the studies that would earn her {{a place in the}} Royal Society. Significant work from this period of Bishop's life included a study showing that the parasite itself did not develop resistance to quinine, but that host organisms could develop resistance to the drug proguanil. Her in vitro research was proven accurate when the drugs she studied were used to treat patients suffering from tertian malaria, a form of the illness in which the paroxysm of fever occurs every third day. She also investigated the drugs pamaquine and atebrin, along with proguanil, though proguanil was the only one shown to cause the development of drug resistance. Other studies showed that malaria parasites could develop cross-resistance to other antimalarial drugs. Bishop worked at Molteno until 1967. Her research and <b>experimental</b> <b>protocols</b> were later used in rodent and human studies, albeit with modifications.|$|E

2500|$|The {{researchers}} {{explain these}} apparently inexcusable inadequacies in <b>experimental</b> <b>protocols</b> by drawing {{a clear distinction}} between two different stages of an investigation: the exploratory, informal experiments and the formal experiments. During the exploratory phase, the researchers would simply be trying to determine whether there is a phenomenon that could be worth further investigation, which often implies the use of much more complicated protocols and expensive equipment. In doing so, they are also trying to set up a comfortable, relaxed atmosphere that is believed to be conducive to psychic phenomena. It is during this stage that Shaw and Edwards were able to convince the researchers of psychic abilities ...|$|E
2500|$|Another partial {{replication}} {{of the experiment}} was conducted by Jerry M. Burger in 2006 and broadcast on the Primetime series Basic Instincts. Burger noted that [...] "current standards {{for the ethical treatment}} of participants clearly place Milgram's studies out of bounds." [...] In 2009, Burger was able to receive approval from the institutional review board by modifying several of the <b>experimental</b> <b>protocols.</b> Burger found obedience rates virtually identical to those reported by Milgram found in 1961–62, even while meeting current ethical regulations of informing participants. In addition, half the replication participants were female, and their rate of obedience was virtually identical to that of the male participants. Burger also included a condition in which participants first saw another participant refuse to continue. However, participants in this condition obeyed at the same rate as participants in the base condition.|$|E
