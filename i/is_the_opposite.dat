5|$|Other {{differences}} between the principal and secondary eyes are that the latter have rhabdomeres that point away from incoming light, just like in vertebrates, while the arrangement <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> in the former. The principal eyes are also the only ones with eye muscles, allowing them to move the retina. Having no muscles, the secondary eyes are immobile.|$|E
5|$|The word Ahimsa—sometimes spelled as Ahinsa—is {{derived from}} the Sanskrit root hiṃs – to strike; hiṃsā is injury or harm, a-hiṃsā <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> of this, i.e. non harming or nonviolence.|$|E
5|$|Background {{selection}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> of {{a selective}} sweep. If a specific site experiences strong and persistent purifying selection, linked variation {{tends to be}} weeded out along with it, producing a region in the genome of low overall variability. Because background selection {{is a result of}} deleterious new mutations, which can occur randomly in any haplotype, it does not produce clear blocks of linkage disequilibrium, although with low recombination it can still lead to slightly negative linkage disequilibrium overall.|$|E

5|$|On June 12, 2003, NOAA {{published}} a forecast for the East Pacific hurricane season, {{the first time}} it had done so. The scientists predicted a 50% chance of below normal activity this season, due to the expectation that La Niña conditions would develop. La Niña conditions generally restrict tropical cyclone development in the northeast Pacific, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> of its effect in the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{distinction}} between when a player is in character, meaning they are actively representing their character, and when the player is out-of-character, meaning they are being themselves. Some LARPs encourage players to stay consistently in character except in emergencies, while others accept players being out-of-character at times. In a LARP, it is usually assumed that players are speaking and acting in character unless otherwise noted, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> of normal practice in tabletop role-playing games. Character knowledge is usually considered to be separate from player knowledge, and acting upon information a character would not know {{may be viewed as}} cheating.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} form as {{a result}} of significant convective activity, and are warm core. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. Cyclolysis <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> of cyclogenesis, and is the high-pressure system equivalent, which deals with the formation of high-pressure areas—Anticyclogenesis.|$|E

5|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the secondest common {{cancer in the world}} and the commonest amongst women, as well as being amongst the ten commonest chronic {{diseases}} of women, and a substantial contributor to loss of quality of life (Gronowski and Schindler, Table IV). Globally, it accounts for 25% of all cancers. In 2016, breast {{cancer is the}} commonest cancer diagnosed amongst women in both developed and developing countries, accounting for nearly 30% of all cases, and worldwide accounts for one and a half million cases and over half a million deaths, being the fifth commonest cause of cancer death overall and the second in developed regions. Geographic variation in incidence <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> of that of cervical cancer, being highest in Northern America and lowest in Eastern and Middle Africa, but mortality rates are relatively constant, resulting in a wide variance in case mortality, ranging from 25% in developed regions to 37% in developing regions, and with 62% of deaths occurring in developing countries.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium {{should be}} a very heavy metal with a density of around 23.7g/cm3 in the solid state; in comparison, the most dense known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from copernicium's high atomic weight, the {{lanthanide}} and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough copernicium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. However, some calculations predict copernicium to be a gas at room temperature, the first gaseous metal in the periodic table (the second being flerovium), due to the closed-shell electron configurations of copernicium and flerovium. The atomic radius of copernicium {{is expected to be}} around 147pm. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Cn+ and Cn2+ ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> of the behavior of its lighter homologues.|$|E
5|$|Rutherfordium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.61), similar to its lighter congener hafnium. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 23.2g/cm3; in comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of 22.61g/cm3. This results from rutherfordium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough rutherfordium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. The atomic radius for rutherfordium {{is expected}} to be around 150pm. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Rf+ and Rf2+ ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> of the behavior of its lighter homologues.|$|E

5|$|Some {{forms of}} {{balancing}} selection do {{not result in}} fixation, but maintain an allele at intermediate frequencies in a population. This can occur in diploid species (with pairs of chromosomes) when heterozygous individuals (with just one copy of the allele) have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals (with two copies). This is called heterozygote advantage or over-dominance, of which the best-known example is the resistance to malaria in humans heterozygous for sickle-cell anaemia. Maintenance of allelic variation can also occur through disruptive or diversifying selection, which favours genotypes that depart from the average in either direction (that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> of over-dominance), and {{can result in a}} bimodal distribution of trait values. Finally, balancing selection can occur through frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of one particular phenotype depends on the distribution of other phenotypes in the population. The principles of game theory have been applied to understand the fitness distributions in these situations, particularly in the study of kin selection and the evolution of reciprocal altruism.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} protons and {{neutrons}} in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies {{because of the}} strong force. Nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, {{at the core of}} the Sun protons require energies of 3–10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the coulomb barrier—and fuse together into a single nucleus. Nuclear fission <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.|$|E
5|$|Oberon is {{the second}} largest and most massive of the Uranian moons after Titania, and the ninth most massive moon in the Solar System. Oberon's density of 1.63g/cm³, which {{is higher than the}} typical density of Saturn's satellites, {{indicates}} that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds. The presence of water ice is supported by spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of the}} moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Oberon's trailing hemisphere than on the leading hemisphere. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> of what is observed on other Uranian moons, where the leading hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to impact gardening (the creation of soil via impacts) of the surface, which is stronger on the leading hemisphere. Meteorite impacts tend to sputter (knock out) ice from the surface, leaving dark non-ice material behind. The dark material itself may have formed as a result of radiation processing of methane clathrates or radiation darkening of other organic compounds.|$|E

5|$|Titania is {{the largest}} and most massive Uranian moon, and the eighth most massive moon in the Solar System. Its density of 1.71 g/cm³, which is much higher than the typical density of Saturn's satellites, {{indicates}} that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and dense non-ice components; the latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations made in 2001–2005, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of the}} moon. Water ice absorption bands are slightly stronger on Titania's leading hemisphere than on the trailing hemisphere. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> of what is observed on Oberon, where the trailing hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to the bombardment by charged particles from the magnetosphere of Uranus, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation). The energetic particles tend to sputter water ice, decompose methane trapped in ice as clathrate hydrate and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich residue behind.|$|E
