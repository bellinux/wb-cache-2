40|$|The Immigration Services Department of Catholic Charities Archdiocese of San Antonio, Inc., {{is seeing}} {{more and more}} women which we believe are by {{definition}} statutorily eligible to be considered “trafficking” victims but who are nevertheless being denied certification and are therefore falling through the cracks of the immigration system. One of our clients, discovered in the trunk of a car by immigration officials after enduring three months of being beaten, raped, starved and sold for sex, cannot get certified for trafficking- because the perpetrators were only charged with “smuggling”. Another who was purchased by a couple to be their sex slave and forced to work at a fast-food restaurant (and of course never paid) can’t get certified because the case isn’t “big enough”. Judgments are being made regarding knowledge and “consent” of the victim which then effectively disqualifies them for this legal remedy. When it comes to trafficking victims, have we reverted to the archaic analogy of the rape victim who “asked for it because she was wearing a short skirt”? If so, what to do about it?!

40|$|I {{am going}} to look into Greek Life sororities on campus at the University of Illinois. I will be looking into if Middle Eastern or Muslim women can {{participate}} in Greek life, {{and to what extent}} she will be looked into when joining a sorority and not be stereotyped as what most Americans think of when they see a young girl wearing a hijab. I will be researching and <b>interviewing</b> <b>what</b> the stereotypes of the Greek system are and where they come from. In addition, I will uncover what stereotypes are associated with sororities: blue eyes, blonde hair, etc. Also, I will see if the individual sororities have stereotypes for the kinds of girls they want or do not want, or if Muslim girls do not want to join because they think sororities have these stereotypes. I will investigate if there is a pressure to look a certain way when one joins a sorority, even if the pressure seems to be implicit. In addition to interviewing Muslim girls, Middle Eastern girls, and non-Muslim girls, I will conduct research on statistics that are associated with race and religion in sororities on campus. I will be looking into the sororities' ideals and their priorities, which include philanthropy, service hours, study hours, and social life. Moreover, I will research IFC, UGC, BGC and Pan-Hellenic sororities; this includes all 37 houses on campus, with a majority of them being Pan-Hellenic (19). I will observe other sororities which can be seen as more academic and investigate the reasons as to why or why not Muslims and Middle Eastern girls might be more attracted to these types of sororities...|$|E

40|$|The {{significant}} {{financial investment}} that the US government {{continues to make}} in its anti-trafficking program should be yielding much greater results by now. Instead, {{there has not been}} a considerable increase in victims identified (despite data suggesting this is a significant problem) nor has there been an increase in the number of international trafficking victims that have been granted a T-Visa (despite over ten years in existence). Two years ago at this conference I presented “Which Comes First, the Smuggling or the Trafficking?” At that time, I explained that the Immigration Department of Catholic Charities San Antonio has been identifying more and more clients whom we believe are by definition statutorily eligible to be considered “trafficking” victims yet trafficking “experts” are refusing to certify them. In particular, I described two clients, who were denied certifications- one because she wanted to come to the US (and therefore “consented”) and the other because her case wasn’t “big enough”. Both of these clients recently received their T-visas, vindicating their stories and highlighting the HUGE disconnect between the government’s investment in anti-trafficking programs and what ultimately is being accomplished in this arena. There appears to be a strange “competition” for the trafficking victim as a number but precious few programs that are willing to do the difficult and time-consuming work involved that will actually assist the victim and/or fix this problem… hence, they are essentially rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.

40|$|Persons who pose {{threats of}} {{violence}} can be rich sources of information for professionals charged with ensuring safety and security. The interviewing of threateners is thus considered important among such professionals, but research on the topic is scarce. This thesis seeks to advance current knowledge by proposing a scientific perspective on effective threat assessment and management (TAM) <b>interviewing.</b> <b>What</b> are the expected dynamics when interacting with persons who threaten to cause harm and, given these dynamics, which interview methods work best? A novel experimental paradigm was developed and employed in Studies I, II, and III. Participants were given a fictitious case describing two conflicting parties and {{were then asked to}} take {{on the role of the}} threatening party in a subsequent interview with the conflicting party. Study I (N = 157) examined whether individuals’ intent to actualise a threat becomes evident in how they verbalise that threat. Intent was manipulated across three conditions through the likelihood to actualise the threat: low likelihood (no intent: bluffers), medium likelihood (weak intent: conditional actualisers), and high likelihood (strong intent: decisive actualisers). Based on theory and research in cognitive psychology, it was predicted that decisive actualisers would provide the most detail about the implementation of the threat, followed by conditional actualisers, and bluffers would provide the least. The opposite trend was found: Persons more likely to actualise a threat were found less informative about its implementation. Study II (N = 179) tested the effect of two interview techniques (low vs. high suspicion-oriented) on the information provided by bluffers and actualisers. Drawing on psychological research examining lie detection, it was theorised that the need to be believed would be more urgent for bluffers than for actualisers. Hence, bluffers were expected to be more forthcoming when questioned about their threats and, in particular, when the questions communicated suspicion. As expected, bluffers provided more information in response to specific questions as compared to actualisers, especially with regard to implementation details (replicating Study I). However, the difference between bluffers and actualisers was not further accentuated by the use of suspicion-oriented questions. Furthermore, Study II explored whether threatening participants had used counter-interview strategies. Participants were found to be forthcoming, while also being strategic and adaptive to interviewers’ responses. Study III (N = 120) tested the hypothesis that rapport-based interviewing would be more effective for threat assessment and management purposes than direct interviewing. Against expectations, no differences were found between interview protocols pertaining to the threateners’ use of counter-interview strategies, their information provision, or their willingness to pursue/discuss the threat. Furthermore, the study advanced Study II by exploring what types of counter-interview strategies threateners employ. Again, threateners were found to be both forthcoming and strategic. The most frequently reported strategies were to prove capability and to conceal information. Study IV was an online study that investigated whether threat assessments made by professionals were of higher quality than those made by non-professionals. Threat assessment professionals, university students, and laypersons assessed the risk for violence in three fictitious cases. In alignment with the literature on expert decision-making, it was predicted that professionals (vs. students and laypersons) would agree more with one another with respect to risk assessments, and that their information search would show more resemblance with empirically supported threat cues. The results supported both hypotheses. Taking the results of the studies together, it could be concluded that threateners are semi-cooperative interviewees, whose attitudes may not be impacted by general interview approaches (e. g. rapport-based, suspicion-oriented). Instead, the findings suggest that more strategic techniques developed from the perspective of threateners (which result in their motivation to be informative prevailing over their need to be strategic) are needed...|$|E
