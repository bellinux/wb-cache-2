5000|$|<b>Erythrophobia</b> is {{the fear}} of blushing, from ερυθρός and φοβία {{literally}} [...] "fear of redness".|$|E
50|$|Names {{exist that}} mean fear of {{specific}} colors such as <b>erythrophobia</b> for {{the fear of}} red and leukophobia for the fear of white. A fear of the color red {{may be associated with}} a fear of blood.|$|E
50|$|In some explanations, the {{equation}} of being looked at {{with a feeling of}} being criticized or despised reveals shame as a motivating force behind scopophobia. In the self-consciousness of adolescence, with its increasing awareness of the Other as constitutive of the looking glass self, shame may exacerbate feelings of <b>erythrophobia</b> and scopophobia.|$|E
50|$|Though scopophobia is {{a solitary}} disorder, many {{individuals}} with scopophobia also commonly experience other anxiety disorders. Scopophobia has {{been related to}} many other irrational fears and phobias. Specific phobias and syndromes {{that are similar to}} scopophobia include <b>erythrophobia,</b> the fear of blushing (which is found especially in young people), and an epileptic's fear that being looked which may itself precipitate such an attack. Scopophobia is also commonly associated with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. It is not considered indicative of other disorders, but is rather considered as a psychological problem that may be treated independently.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the autonomic functions of patients with <b>erythrophobia.</b> Methods: Forty patients with a diagnosis of <b>erythrophobia</b> (female/male ratio 18 / 22) without any other organic lesions and 20 healthy volunteers (female/male ratio 10 / 10) were assessed. Clinical evaluation was performed using a modified version of semistructured interviews. Autonomic testing was performed by means of spectral analysis of heart rate and continuous blood pressure by sparse discrete Fourier transformation at rest and under mental stress. Results: There were no significant difference between the two samples in age, sex distribution, BMI, resting systolic, or diastolic blood pressure, nor was there a difference in autonomic baseline functioning between the 40 patients with <b>erythrophobia</b> and the control subjects. On the other hand, patients with <b>erythrophobia</b> consistently showed higher pulse rates (88 � 20 vs. 78 � 9 bpm, p �. 05), higher total heart rate power values (8. 40 � 0. 63 vs. 8. 07 � 1. 02 p �. 05), higher midfrequency spectral values (7. 38 � 0. 66 vs. 7. 02 � 1. 18, p �. 01), higher high-frequency spectral values (6. 89 � 0. 86 vs. 6. 48 � 1. 44, p �. 05), and lower baroreceptor sensitivity (8. 62 � 8. 16 vs. 11. 65 � 4. 42, p �. 005) than the healthy subjects. ANOVA showed a significant group interaction (p �. 0001) between the samples. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for abnormal autonomic functioning in patients with <b>erythrophobia</b> when under mental stress.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigate}} whether people attribute costs to displaying a blush. Individuals {{with and without}} fear of blushing were invited to have a short conversation with two confederates. During the conversation, half of the individuals received the feedback that they were blushing intensely. The study tested whether the belief that one is blushing leads to the anticipation that one will be judged negatively. In addition, the set-up permitted the actual physiological blush response to be investigated. In line with the model that we propose for <b>erythrophobia,</b> participants in the feedback condition expected the confederates to judge them relatively negatively, independent of their fear of blushing. Furthermore, sustaining the idea that believing that one will blush {{can act as a}} self-fulfilling prophecy, high-fearfuls showed relatively intense facial coloration in both conditions, whereas low-fearfuls only showed enhanced blush responses following false blush feedback.

40|$|Based on his {{observations}} in Japanese clinical settings, Fujinawa (1972) conceptualized egorrhea syndrome, which includes {{symptoms such as}} <b>erythrophobia,</b> fear of eye-to-eye confrontation, olfactory reference syndrome, delusions of soliloquy, delusions of sleep talking, and thought broadcasting. The key feature of this syndrome is self-leakage, a perceived sense that one’s personal internal information, such as feelings and thoughts, are leaking out. To reach a more comprehensive understanding of egorrhea, this paper aims to present general overview and reconsider the phenomenon of self-leakage using cultural-clinical psychology as a framework. First, the symptoms of egorrhea are reviewed {{in relation to other}} related psychopathologies such as social anxiety disorder (SAD) and taijin kyofusho (TKS), as well as schizophrenia. Second, a series of empirical studies conducted using Japanese non-clinical samples are summarized. The results of these studies form the basis for subsequent discussions, which incorporates the cultural-clinical psychology perspective proposed by Ryder et al. (2011). This paper ends with a general discussion regarding implications for research and clinical practice...|$|E
