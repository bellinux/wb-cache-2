5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E
25|$|I {{am writing}} {{to ask you}} to {{consider}} the inclusion of my son, E. M. Grace– a splendid hitter and most excellent catch– in your England XI. I am sure he would play very well and do the team much credit. It may interest you to learn that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> son, now twelve years of age, who will in time be a much better player than his brother because his back stroke is sounder, and he always plays with a straight bat.|$|E
2500|$|The Braves {{earned their}} fourth win {{of the season}} against former Braves pitcher Alex Wood and the Los Angeles Dodgers in a {{lopsided}} 8–1 game at Turner Field. Wood said after the game that it [...] "was not really the way I pictured coming back {{here for the first}} time. Fastball command was the most frustrating thing. I don't even know if I've walked in a run before in my professional career. The walks were pretty frustrating. It was a tough one to swallow, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> one in five days." [...] Despite a 3-1 lead, the Dodgers scored four unanswered runs to snap the Braves four-game win streak. A Yasmani Grandal double in the 10th inning gave the Dodgers a 2–1 victory in the Braves's fourth extra-inning game of the season.|$|E

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> humiliating {{confession}} to make--I {{tried to get}} off going to Browndown. (So like those unfeeling French people, isn't it?) ...|$|E
6000|$|Lee, {{burning with}} mingled flames of resentment and humor, replied: [...] "Thank you, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> call to make--Thursday, then, at seven o'clock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Abdool, I {{shall have}} {{to look out for}} another cook and body servant; unless, indeed, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> trooper told off to me." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{due course}} of time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> {{manuscript}} finished, and I sent it to my favorite periodical. It was retained some weeks, and then came back to me.|$|R
60|$|Without any {{artificial}} aid, I got {{a splendid}} night's rest last night, and consequently am very much freshened up to-day. Yesterday <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a fine walk by the sea, and to-day <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> on the heights overlooking it.|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} a dinner <b>I</b> <b>had</b> long ago with Whitelaw Reid and John Hay at Reid's expense. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> {{last summer when}} I was in London at the embassy that Choate blackguards so. I'd like to live there.|$|R
60|$|Mor. Well, if {{it must be}} so, agreed; for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> {{trick to}} play you, and thank {{yourself}} for what shall follow.|$|E

6000|$|... "For the moment," [...] he said, [...] "we will {{quit the}} subject. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> matter, equally delicate, which I {{should like to}} discuss with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must {{go over to}} Fink's," [...] {{said the}} Kid, rising, [...] "for some tobacco. <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> sack in my coat. I'll {{be back in a}} quarter of an hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have brought}} {{a hundred and fifty}} with me, Sandy, so we have as many as we can use on the walls, though I could wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> hundred or two for sorties." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You shall hear directly," [...] replied Magdalen. [...] "I have {{something}} to say first. I told you, last night, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> object in view besides the object of earning my living on the stage--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you're to keep them, of course. That is what I {{meant when}} I gave them. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> {{pair of shoes}} and plenty of stockings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dreadfully; oh, quite terribly. You {{ought to}} have a rug, you really ought. Won't you let me lend you one? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> under the seat here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It sounds obvious, but {{the very}} {{intensity}} of love makes love soft and blind. Now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another,</b> which I am convinced {{that you will not}} agree with.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> {{letter from}} Mrs. Fenton, who says {{you were with}} her; I hope you did not go on purpose. I will answer her letter soon; it is about some money in Lady Giffard's hands.|$|R

6000|$|MY DEAR MISS FERRIER,--They say Walter is gone. You, {{who know}} how <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{neglected}} him, will conceive my remorse. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> letter written; when I heard he was worse, I promised myself to wake up for the last time. Alas, too late! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Another word, and I'll arrest you, Mr. Clavering," [...] he said. [...] "Sling those rifles, all of you! <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> troop {{with horses}} picketed behind the bluff." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "When I was under, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> above me; and now, as I'm upper, why there's others under me." [...] So she {{explained}} her {{position at the}} hotel, but she never took {{her eyes from the}} canopy.|$|R
50|$|It is not {{the first}} time <b>I</b> <b>have</b> heard this happening. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> Muslim leader call me a year or so ago, in tears - she told me they had been coming into her house and re-arranging things - just to let her know they had been there.|$|R
