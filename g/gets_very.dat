25|$|Ayuki is {{interested}} in the sciences, though most specifically, biological sciences. During Hitoshi Sora's first biology lesson at school, Ayuki commented that he leads a most intriguing class, referring to the genetically modified sunflowers he engineered which also turned out to be rather harmful.

Unlike her usual self which is calm and generally quiet, Ayuki <b>gets</b> <b>very</b> upset by this news, and pleads Hitoshi to do something to keep Hazumu alive since he once before brought her back from the dead, eventually leading to Ayuki starting to cry. Hitoshi corrects her that his species is not omnipotent and while his people may be more advanced technologically, they are still inferior as a race compared to humans of Earth. After Ayuki learns that Hitoshi will remain on Earth for the next 100 years, she expresses interest in becoming a human collaborator in his observations of love.|$|E

500|$|The writers for {{the season}} worked in Los Angeles, with {{one member of the}} writing team on set in New York for filming. Actress Carrie-Anne Moss talked about how the scripts {{developed}} through the production of the season, explaining that the dialogue usually did not change much while filming, but scenes were altered to accommodate the filming locations when necessary. Rosenberg stated that, since Jones is a private investigator, there would be some procedural elements to the show, [...] "but that’s not our focus. There are cases.

Cloke did research on multiple personality disorders before filming, and based the various personalities on people she knew.

[...] When pitching the idea to director Rob Bowman, the writers stated they wanted [...] "this episode to feel like the part in Ken Burns' Civil War documentary where they read the Sullivan Ballou letter." [...] Michael Massee wanted his characterization of Ephesian to be [...] "normal looking" [...] and [...] "nondemonic", explaining, [...] "You have to believe that he believes his own rap.

500|$|Bond {{is on an}} {{assignment}} in the Seychelles Islands; through Fidele Barbey, his influential and well-connected local contact, he meets an uncouth American millionaire named Milton Krest, who challenges the two to aid him {{in the search for}} a rare fish, The Hildebrand Rarity. Bond, Barbey, Krest and his English wife, Elizabeth, set off aboard the Wavekrest in search of the fish. During the journey, Bond learns that Milton verbally and physically abuses everyone around him, especially his wife—whom he punishes {{with the use of a}} stingray tail he dubs [...] "The Corrector". Krest finds the Hildebrand Rarity and kills it—along with many other fish—by pouring poison into the water. After finding and killing the Hildebrand Rarity, the Wavekrest sets sail for port. Along the way Krest <b>gets</b> <b>very</b> drunk, insults Bond and Barbey and tells his wife he will beat her again with the stingray tail. Later that night, Bond hears Krest choking; investigating, Bond finds that Krest has been murdered—apparently by having the rare fish stuffed down his throat. So as not to be entangled in a murder investigation, Bond throws Krest overboard and cleans up the scene of the crime, making it look as though Krest fell overboard after one of the ropes holding his hammock broke: Bond suspects both Barbey and Mrs. Krest, but is unsure which is responsible. However, when Mrs. Krest invites Bond to sail with her to Mombasa—his next destination—aboard the Wavekrest, he accepts her invitation with reservations.|$|E
