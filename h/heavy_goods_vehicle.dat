The white lorry may have been broken down, and a number of people were reportedly seen around the vehicle.

2500|$|On 22 December 2014 a bin lorry {{collided}} with pedestrians {{in the city}} centre of Glasgow, Scotland, killing six and injuring fifteen others. The driver of the council-owned vehicle, Harry Clarke, said he had passed out at the wheel. A similar blackout {{had happened to him}} in the driving seat of a bus, although he had not disclosed the incident on his <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> licence renewal [...] application, despite such self-reporting being mandatory. Clarke was officially told he would not face further prosecution, effectively giving him immunity over the deaths and causing protests from victims' families at the way the case had been handled. In October 2015 it was reported that Clarke had been arrested on suspicion of driving without a licence in September 2015.|$|E
2500|$|... {{the toll}} is £6.70 {{for a car}} and £20.00 for a <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Motorcycles and {{disabled}} badge holders are exempt from the tolls, although both must stop at the toll booths to have their eligibility confirmed, and also to allow the barrier to be raised. The tolls for the Second Severn Crossing are the same, although in that case, the tolls are collected on the Welsh side (although still for traffic entering Wales, not leaving it), sufficiently far from the bridge that even severe queueing does not reach it. A system known as the Severn TAG is also in operation, which allows drivers to pay electronically without having {{to stop at the}} toll booths. TAGs are available either on a per-trip or a seasonal basis, although only the latter attracts a discount.|$|E

40|$|The SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research investigated: (a) the {{problems}} occurring on Dutch municipal roads that involve <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles; and (b) what measures {{can be taken}} to correct these problems. A survey was conducted among 24 municipalities to accomplish this study. According to the Regional Committees for Road Safety, twelve of these municipalities experienced (or are experiencing) problems with <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The remaining twelve municipalities were selected from the Statistics Netherlands' file of Dutch municipalities by means of a stratified sample. `Obvious' problems mentioned by the municipalities were: (1) <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> within, and travelling through, the town centre; (2) <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> on major roads inside built-up areas; and (3) inconveniences caused by these vehicles. It is described which measures have already been taken and which ones are being prepared. Only two measures were mentioned by {{more than half of the}} municipalities: (i) concentrating business within industrial sites; and (ii) instituting entry prohibitions for lorries. It is concluded that definitely more attention should be given to measures concerning <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The approach to problems involving these vehicles was based on the principles of the `sustainably safe' concept. Measures recommended for solving these problems were: realising major roads, and creating areas with low vehicle concentrations. (A...|$|R

40|$|Demand {{elasticity}} {{for petrol}} or diesel {{is an important}} policy parameter, both from energy security and global warming perspective. Despite an abundance of literature on petrol demand, there are few studies on diesel demand, and even fewer on demand by different vehicle types. This paper aims to model diesel demand for different freight duty vehicle types (e. g. <b>heavy</b> vs. light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> and rigid vs. articulated trucks) in the UK. We argue that the switch to diesel from petrol engines in the light vehicles sectors could have biased earlier petrol or diesel demand elasticities in Europe, and show that it was indeed {{the case for the}} light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> sector. Results show that both light and <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> have similar income elasticities, although within the heavy duty sector, articulated trucks are more elastic than rigid trucks. Overall, <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> were responsive to fuel prices, but light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> were not. Within the heavy duty sector, rigid trucks showed statistically significant price elasticity, but articulated trucks did not respond to changes in fuel prices. Our results show that price-based policies to curb fuel consumption from the light or <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> are unlikely to be effective...|$|R
