In the immediate family alone, there were thirteen times thirteen, besides those coming from, and going to outsiders, {{so that it was}} as well that a good many should be of domestic manufacture, either with pencil and brush, or of tiny leaves carefully dried and gummed. And mamma had kept an album, with names and dates, into which all these home efforts were inserted, and nothing else! This year's series began with a little chestnut curl of Primrose's hair, fastened down on a card by Gillian, and rose to a beautiful drawing of a blue <b>Indian</b> <b>Lotus</b> lily, with a gorgeous dragon-fly on it, sent by Alethea. The Indian party had sent a card for every one--the girls, beautiful drawings of birds, insects, and scenery; the brother, a bundle of rice-paper figured with costumes, and papa, some clever pen-and-ink outlines of odd figures, which his daughters beguiled from him in his leisure moments! ...|$|E

50|$|This is one {{of several}} genera of plants known {{commonly}} as lotuses. It is not related to the legume genus Lotus or the Chinese and <b>Indian</b> <b>lotuses</b> of genus Nelumbo. It is closely related to Nuphar lotuses, however. In Nymphaea, the petals are much larger than the sepals, whereas in Nuphar, the petals are much smaller. The process of fruit maturation also differs, with Nymphaea fruit sinking below the water level immediately after the flower closes, and Nuphar fruit remaining above the surface.|$|R
50|$|Dried lotus seeds must be {{soaked in}} water {{overnight}} prior to use. They {{can then be}} added directly to soups and congee or used in other dishes. Fresh lotus seeds are sold in the seed heads of the plant and eaten by breaking the individual seeds out of the cone-shaped head and removing the rubbery shell. Crystallized lotus seeds (蓮子糖), made by drying lotus seeds cooked in syrup, are a common Chinese snack, especially during Chinese new year.In Manipur, the North-East <b>Indian</b> state, <b>lotus</b> seeds are locally known as thamchet and are eaten raw.|$|R
50|$|An electoral symbol is a {{standardised}} symbol {{allocated to}} a political party. Symbols are used by parties in their campaigning, and printed on ballot papers where a voter must make a mark {{to vote for the}} associated party. Their purpose is to facilitate voting by illiterate people, who cannot read parties' names on ballot papers. Examples include an elephant's head and three lotus flowers (Cambodian Democratic Party) and a <b>lotus</b> (<b>Indian</b> Bhartiya Janata Party). In Brazil parties are allocated two-digit numbers, easily recognised by the illiterate, instead.|$|R

In 2001 he was ordained into the then Western Buddhist Order (now Triratna Buddhist Order) and given the Order name of Akashadeva ('deity of etheric space'). Some of his musical compositions show influences from this immersion in Buddhist thinking, in particular the piano suite Mandalas, whose four movements are inspired among others by the vajras of <b>Indian</b> mythology, the <b>lotus</b> symbol and the Five Dhyani Buddhas that represent the five key qualities of the Buddha.|$|R
5000|$|In South <b>Indian</b> states, the <b>lotus</b> stem is sliced, marinated {{with salt}} to dry, and the dried slices are fried {{and used as}} a side dish. In Kerala (in Malayalam [...] "താമര") and Tamil Nadu, this end product is called [...] " [...] Thamara Vathal". In Sri Lanka, finely sliced lotus rhizome cooked with coconut milk and spices is a popular curry known as Nelum Ala Vyanjanaya (නෙළුම් අල ව්‍යංජනය). In Vietnam, the bitter tasting germs of the lotus seeds are also made into a tisane (trà tim sen).|$|R
5000|$|... 22 June 1897 (२२ जून १८९७ [...] ) is a 1979 Marathi film, co-written by Shankar Nag and Nachiket Patwardhan and {{directed}} by {{the husband and wife}} team of Jayoo Patwardhan and Nachiket Patwardhan. The duo are also practising architects. It is based on the true life story of the assassination of British Government officers Rand ICS and Lt.

5000|$|An {{economically}} deprived area of Laudium (described in {{an academic}} paper as a [...] "ghetto"), informally called White Blocks (named after their paint colour), with single and multi-family government-built dwelling units is situated {{in the western part}} of Laudium. However, the <b>Indian</b> township of <b>Lotus</b> Gardens was established in the early 1990s, north of Church Street, and many Indian families from White Blocks were relocated there, and some old units were torn down. Lotus Gardens developed into a multiracial suburb. White Blocks continues to exist though the units are no longer exclusively painted white. The Laudium Police Station is in White Blocks, in a converted unit.|$|R

50|$|Lotus (Gr.). A most occult plant, sacred in Egypt, India and else where; called “the {{child of}} the Universe bearing the {{likeness}} of its mother in its bosom”. There was a time “when {{the world was a}} golden lotus” (padma) says the allegory. A great variety of these plants, from the majestic <b>Indian</b> <b>lotus,</b> down to the marsh-lotus (bird’s foot trefoil) and the Grecian “Dioscoridis”, is eaten at Crete and other islands. It is a species of nymphala, first introduced from India to Egypt to which it was-not indigenous. See the text of Archaic Symbolism in the Appendix Viii. “The Lotus, as a Universal Symbol”.|$|E
50|$|Nelumbo nucifera, {{also known}} as <b>Indian</b> <b>lotus,</b> sacred lotus, bean of India, Egyptian bean or simply lotus, {{is one of two}} extant species of aquatic plant in the family Nelumbonaceae. The Linnaean {{binomial}} Nelumbo nucifera (Gaertn.) is the currently recognized name for this species, which has been classified under the former names, Nelumbium speciosum (Willd.) and Nymphaea nelumbo, among others. (These names are obsolete synonyms and should be avoided in current works.) This plant is an aquatic perennial. Under favorable circumstances its seeds may remain viable for many years, with the oldest recorded lotus germination being from that of seeds 1,300 years old recovered from a dry lakebed in northeastern China.|$|E
5000|$|Stone Town's {{architecture}} has {{a number}} of distinctive features, as a result of Arab, Persian, Indian, European, and African traditions mixing together. The name [...] "Stone Town" [...] comes from the ubiquitous use of coral stone as the main construction material; this stone gives the town a characteristic, reddish warm colour. Traditional buildings have a baraza, a long stone bench along the outside walls; this is used as an elevated sidewalk if heavy rains make the streets impracticable, or otherwise as benches to sit down, rest, socialize. Another key feature of most buildings is large verandas protected by carved wooden balustrades. The most well-known feature of Zanzibari houses are the finely decorated wooden doors, with rich carvings and bas-reliefs, sometimes with big brass studs of Indian tradition. Two main types of doors can be distinguished: those of Indian style have rounded tops, while those in the Omani Arab style are rectangular. Carvings are often Islamic in content (for example, many consist of verses of the Qur'an), but other symbolism is occasionally used, e.g., <b>Indian</b> <b>lotus</b> flowers as emblems of prosperity.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to study the antioxidant activities and nitric oxide (NO) scavenging effects of vegetables in vitro systems and to study the inhibitory effects of vegetables on the NO production and NO-induced DNA damage in RAW 264. 7 macrophage. The results indicated that water extracts from <b>Indian</b> <b>lotus,</b> Jew's ear, shiitake, eggplant, and winter mushroom showed stronger antioxidant activity and free-radical-scavenging ability than that of other vegetable extracts. The scavenging effects of vegetable extracts on NO derived from sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were in decreasing order of water spinach > <b>Indian</b> <b>lotus</b> > eggplant and garland chrysanthemum. In the macrophage model system, the water extracts from fresh daylily flower, sponge gourd, pea sprout, and eggplant exhibited over 80 % inhibition on NO generation stimulated by lipopolysaccharide. The extract from fresh daylily flower that expressed the strongest inhibition on NO production was attributed to the ability to reduce the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induction. However, the extracts from pea sprout and eggplant suppressed the NO production by scavenging on NO and inactivating toward iNOS enzyme. In addition, the water extracts from fresh daylily flower, sponge gourd, pea sprout, and eggplant also showed over 40 % inhibitory effect on DNA damage induced by SNP in RAW 264. 7 macrophage. The data also indicated that eggplant and pea sprout extracts contained higher total phenolic compounds, anthocyanins, and ascorbic acids and appeared to be responsible for their antioxidant activities and scavenging effects on NO derived from SNP...|$|E
40|$|The study records seven families, 11 genera and 14 {{species of}} hemipteran insect {{community}} in different seasons in a temple pond near Silchar, Cachar District, Assam, northeastern India. The pond is very rich in macrophytes like Nelumbo nucifera (Water Lotus), Hygrorhiza aristata (<b>Indian</b> <b>Lotus),</b> Cynodon dactylon (Bermuda Grass), Philotria sp. etc. The hemipteran families {{recorded in the}} system were Corixidae, Gerridae, Aphididae, Mesoveliidae, Notonectidae, Nepidae and Belostomatidae. The species were Micronecta haliploides, Micronecta (Basileonecta) scutellaris scutellaris (Stål) (Corixidae); Neogerris parvula (Stål), Limnogonus nitidus (Mayr), Tenagogerris sp., Rhagadotarsus sp. (Gerridae); Enithares ciliata (Fabricius), Anisops lundbladiana Landsbury, (Notonectidae); Diplonychus rusticus (Fabricius) and Diplonychus annulatus (Fabricius) (Belostomatidae), Rhopalosiphum nymphaeae (Linnaeus) (Aphididae), Ranatra elongata (Fabricius), Ranatra varipes varipes (Stål) (Nepidae) and Mesovelia vittigera Horváth (Mesoveliidae). The highest population of Hemiptera was recorded during the post-monsoon followed by the pre-monsoon and the monsoon periods. The lowest was recorded in the winter. Shannon Weiner diversity index (H/) and evenness index (J/) showed the highest diversity and evenness during the post monsoon period. Berger Parker index of dominance (d) was found highest in winter. In winter both diversity and density were the lowest. The study revealed the presence of four dominant species and three sub-dominant species in the pond. Insect diversity did not show any significant relationship with the environmental variables...|$|E
