5|$|In {{voting against}} the Force Bill, Tyler {{knew he would}} {{permanently}} alienate the pro-Jackson faction of the Virginia legislature, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> had tolerated his irregularity up to this point. This jeopardized his re-election in February 1833, in which he faced the pro-administration Democrat James McDowell; however, with Clay's endorsement, Tyler was re-elected {{by a margin of}} 12 votes.|$|E
5|$|It is {{wonderful}} {{that both of}} these things occurred under Valerian; {{and it is the}} more remarkable in this case when we consider his previous conduct, for he had been mild and friendly toward the men of God, for none of the emperors before him had treated them so kindly and favorably; and not <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> were said openly to be Christians received them with such manifest hospitality and friendliness as he did {{at the beginning of his}} reign. For his entire house was filled with pious persons and was a church of God.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's {{economic}} thinking only {{began to}} achieve close to universal acceptance {{in the last}} few years of his life. On a personal level, Keynes's charm was such that he was generally well received wherever he went – <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> found themselves on the wrong side of his occasionally sharp tongue rarely bore a grudge. Keynes's speech at the closing of the Bretton Woods negotiations was received with a lasting standing ovation, rare in international relations, as the delegates acknowledged the scale of his achievements made despite poor health.|$|E

5|$|Krishna's {{childhood}} {{illustrates the}} Hindu concept of lila, playing {{for fun and}} enjoyment and not for sport or gain. His interaction with the gopis at the rasa dance or Rasa-lila is an example. Krishna plays his flute and the gopis come immediately, from whatever they were doing, to {{the banks of the}} Yamuna River, and join him in singing and dancing. <b>Even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> could not physically be there join him through meditation. He is the spiritual essence and the love-eternal in existence, the gopis metaphorically represent the prakṛti matter and the impermanent body.|$|E
5|$|The {{autonomic}} or involuntary nervous system, {{which is}} involved in the control of body functions such as heart rate and blood pressure, is affected in two thirds of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome, but the impact is variable. Twenty percent may experience severe blood-pressure fluctuations and irregularities in the heart beat, sometimes {{to the point that the}} heart beat stops and requiring pacemaker-based treatment. Other associated problems are abnormalities in perspiration and changes in the reactivity of the pupils. Autonomic nervous system involvement can affect <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> do not have severe muscle weakness.|$|E
5|$|Although strenuous and {{requiring}} physical fitness, {{none of the}} conventional routes require specialist mountaineering skills or technical rock climbing. The main dangers of the mountain are those common to all high mountains, particularly altitude sickness. This can affect anyone, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> are acclimatized. In serious cases, {{it can lead to}} high-altitude pulmonary edema and cerebral edema, which can lead to difficulties with breathing, paralysis, and death. Climbers are advised to begin their ascent at or before 6 a.m. and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while at high altitudes. Although the most conventional form of ascent is by hiking, Anna Elizabeth Dickinson, the orator, ascended the mountain on a mule borrowed from the U.S. government.|$|E

5|$|In {{a review}} for Times Higher Education, Jack Harris says that Walker is an {{extremely}} good writer and <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> do not specialise in technical fields will derive enjoyment from the book. According to Harris, Walker has unique experience as historian to the NRC which has placed him in an unrivalled position to tell the TMI story. But Harris identifies some omissions in the book. There is little on the other two major nuclear that threatened large civilian populations: the Windscale fire (UK, October 1957), and the Chernobyl disaster (Ukraine, April 1986). Harris states that Windscale threw up similar problems to TMI, particularly relating to whether large-scale evacuations should have been initiated, but he could find no reference to the Windscale accident in the book's index which is surprising in a book that aims to put TMI in historical perspective.|$|E
5|$|Who's Your City? was {{intended}} to be a self-help book, based on scholarly research and an academic theory, that provided a reader the mental framework necessary to match their personality and life situation with the optimum city to reside. Florida drew upon his past research on the geographical aspects of wealth generation and locational decisions of members of the creative class, as well as theories and opinions of other academics, like Jane Jacobs, and <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have been critical of Florida's work, like Tim Harford. New research included a psychological aspect to his theory. Maps, graphs, tables, and indices illustrate the text.|$|E
5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E

5|$|Key {{warships}} {{that remained}} in government hands included the old cruiser , Bahias sister , the eight new destroyers of the Pará class. Their crews {{were in a}} state of flux at the time: with nearly half of the navy's enlisted men in Rio at that time in open revolt, naval officers were suspicious of <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> remained loyal to the government. These suspicions were perhaps well-placed, given that radio operators on loyal ships passed on operational plans to the mutineers. Enlisted men on ships that remained in government hands were reduced wherever possible, and officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat. Further complicating matters were weapon supplies, such as the destroyer's torpedoes. These could not be fired without firing caps, yet the caps were not where they were supposed to be. When they were located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes on board the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only 48 hours after the rebellion began.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cases may}} be {{triggered}} by the influenza virus and potentially influenza vaccine. An increased incidence of Guillain–Barré syndrome followed influenza immunization that followed the 1976 swine flu outbreak (H1N1A/NJ/76); 8.8 cases per million recipients developed the complication. Since then, close monitoring of cases attributable to vaccination has demonstrated that influenza itself can induce GBS. Small increases in incidence have been observed in subsequent vaccination campaigns, {{but not to the}} same extent. The 2009 flu pandemic vaccine (against pandemic swine flu virus H1N1/PDM09) did not cause a significant increase in cases. It is considered that the benefits of vaccination in preventing influenza outweigh the small risks of GBS after vaccination. <b>Even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have previously experienced Guillain–Barré syndrome are considered safe to receive the vaccine in the future. Other vaccines, such as those against poliomyelitis, tetanus or measles, have not been associated with a risk of GBS.|$|E
5|$|The Flavian {{approach}} to government {{was one of}} both implicit and explicit exclusion. When Vespasian returned to Rome in mid-70, he immediately embarked {{on a series of}} efforts to consolidate his power and prevent future revolts. He offered gifts to the military and dismissed or punished those soldiers loyal to Vitellius. He also restructured the Senatorial and Equestrian orders, removing his enemies and adding his allies. Executive control was largely distributed among members of his family. Non-Flavians were virtually excluded from important public offices, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> had been among Vespasian's earliest supporters during the civil war. Mucianus slowly disappears from the historical records during this time, and it is believed he died sometime between 75 and 77. That it was Vespasian's intention to found a long-lasting dynasty to govern the Roman Empire was most evident in the powers he conferred upon his eldest son Titus. Titus shared tribunician power with his father, received seven consulships, the censorship, and perhaps most remarkably, was given command of the Praetorian Guard. Because Titus effectively acted as co-emperor with his father, no abrupt change in Flavian policy occurred during his brief reign from 79 until 81.|$|E

5|$|The {{whole town}} goes cold turkey {{and begins to}} suffer from intense sugar withdrawal. Homer joins a secret group led by Garth Motherloving and Mr. Burns to smuggle sugar from the island of San Glucos. After {{arriving}} back in Springfield, and evading a police boat, Homer brings the sugar to the docks. Marge pleads Homer to dump the cargo. There Homer is presented with two choices: to obey Marge and press the button Drop Cargo or bring the sugar to Garth Motherloving by pressing the button Obey Bad Guy. After contemplating, Homer drops the cargo and all the sugar falls to the Springfield docks' water. All Springfielders, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> seemed happier and healthier without sugar, jump into the harbor and drink the sugar water. Judge Snyder then declares the ban over and dives in with everyone else. Marge is upset and she thinks about giving up changing the world. However, Homer tells her that he loves her when she tries to make a world a better place.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} Turkish theatre dates back {{thousands}} of years to ancient pagan rituals. The dances, music and songs performed during the rituals of the inhabitants of Anatolia millennia ago are the elements from which the first shows originated. These rituals later became theatrical shows. In the 10th century, a blend of traditions occurred between the Seljuk Turks {{and those of the}} inhabitants of Anatolia. The interaction between the various tribal societies paved the way for new plays. After the Tanzimat (Reformation) period, characters in Turkish theatre were modernized and plays were performed on European-style stages with the actors wearing European costumes. Following the declaration of the second Constitutional Monarchy in 1908, theatrical activities increased and social problems began to be reflected in the theatre as well as in historical plays. A theatrical conservatoire, Darülbedayi-i Osmani, was established in Istanbul in 1914. During the years of chaos and war, the Darülbedayi-i Osmani continued its activities and attracted the younger generation. Turkish playwrights emerged. Some wrote on romantic subjects, others were interested in social problems and still others dealt with nationalistic themes. There were <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> wrote musicals. In time, Turkish ladies began to appear on stage and this was indeed a revolution of the time, since female roles had only been played by actresses who were members of Turkey’s ethnic minorities. Today, theatre acts are performed by numerous private theatre companies and subsidized companies such as the Turkish State Theatres.|$|E
