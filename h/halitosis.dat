5|$|Acid {{erosion of}} the teeth can be a feature of rumination, as can <b>halitosis</b> (bad breath).|$|E
5|$|Little {{comprehensive}} {{data regarding}} rumination syndrome in otherwise healthy individuals exists because most sufferers are private about their illness {{and are often}} misdiagnosed due {{to the number of}} symptoms and the clinical similarities between rumination syndrome and other disorders of the stomach and esophagus, such as gastroparesis and bulimia nervosa. These symptoms include the acid-induced erosion of the esophagus and enamel, <b>halitosis,</b> malnutrition, severe weight loss and an unquenchable appetite. Individuals may begin regurgitating within a minute following ingestion, and the full cycle of ingestion and regurgitation can mimic the binging and purging of bulimia.|$|E
25|$|Synonyms for ORS, many historical, include bromidrosiphobia, {{olfactory}} phobic syndrome, chronic olfactory paranoid syndrome, autodysomophobia, {{delusions of}} bromosis, hallucinations of smell and olfactory delusional syndrome. By definition, the many terms {{which have been}} suggested in the dental literature to refer to subjective <b>halitosis</b> complaints (i.e. where a person complains of <b>halitosis</b> yet no odor is detectable clinically) {{can also be considered}} under the umbrella of ORS. Examples include halitophobia, non-genuine <b>halitosis,</b> delusional <b>halitosis,</b> pseudo-halitosis, imaginary <b>halitosis,</b> psychosomatic <b>halitosis,</b> and self <b>halitosis.</b>|$|E

25|$|BHT is {{a benign}} condition, {{but people who}} are {{affected}} may be distressed at the appearance and possible <b>halitosis,</b> and therefore treatment is indicated.|$|E
25|$|Food debris, desquamated {{epithelial}} cells and bacteria often form a visible tongue coating. This coating {{has been identified}} as a major contributing factor in bad breath (<b>halitosis),</b> which can be managed by using a tongue cleaner.|$|E
25|$|DMSO is metabolized by {{disproportionation}} to {{dimethyl sulfide}} and dimethyl sulfone. It {{is subject to}} renal and pulmonary excretion. A possible side effect of DMSO is therefore elevated blood dimethyl sulfide, which may cause a blood borne <b>halitosis</b> symptom.|$|E
25|$|Protruding tonsilloliths {{may feel}} like foreign objects {{lodged in the}} tonsil crypt. They may be a {{nuisance}} and difficult to remove, but are usually not harmful. They {{are one of the}} causes of <b>halitosis</b> (bad breath) and always give off a putrid smell.|$|E
25|$|Romans {{believed}} that wine {{had the power}} to both heal and harm. Wine was a recommended cure for mental disorders such as depression, memory loss and grief, as well as bodily ailments, from bloating, constipation, diarrhea, gout, and <b>halitosis</b> to snakebites, tapeworms, urinary problems and vertigo.|$|E
25|$|In a dry socket, {{healing is}} delayed because tissue must grow from the {{surrounding}} gingival mucosa, which takes longer than the normal organisation of a blood clot. Some patients may develop short term <b>halitosis,</b> {{which is the result}} of food debris stagnating in the socket and the subsequent action of halitogenic bacteria. The main factors involved in the development of dry socket are discussed below.|$|E
25|$|The {{defining}} {{feature of}} ORS is excessive thoughts of having offensive body odor(s) which are detectable to others. The individual may {{report that the}} odor comes from: the nose and/or mouth, i.e. <b>halitosis</b> (bad breath), the anus, the genitals, the skin generally, or specifically the groin, armpits or feet. The source(s) of the supposed odor may also change over time. There are also some who are unsure of the exact origin of the odor. The odor is typically reported to be continuously present. The character of the odor may be reported as similar to bodily substances, e.g. feces, flatus, urine, sweat, vomitus, semen, vaginal secretions; or alternatively {{it may be an}} unnatural, non-human or chemical odor, e.g. ammonia, detergent, rotten onions, burnt rags, candles, garbage, burning fish, medicines, old cheese. Again, the reported character of the odor complaint may change over time. <b>Halitosis</b> appears to be the most common manifestation of ORS, with 75% complaining of bad breath, alone or in combination with other odors. The next most common complaint was sweat (60%).|$|E
25|$|Hairy tongue largely {{occurs in}} {{the central part of}} the dorsal tongue, just {{anterior}} (in front) of the circumvallate papillae, although sometimes the entire dorsal surface may be involved. Discoloration usually accompanies hairy tongue, and may be yellow, brown or black. Apart from the appearance, the condition is typically asymptomatic, but sometimes people may experience a gagging sensation or a bad taste. There may also be associated oral malodor (intra-oral <b>halitosis).</b>|$|E
25|$|The H. pylori {{hypothesis}} was initially poorly received, so {{in an act}} of self-experimentation Marshall drank a Petri dish containing a culture of organisms extracted from a person with an ulcer and five days later developed gastritis. His symptoms disappeared after two weeks, but he took antibiotics to kill the remaining bacteria at the urging of his wife, since <b>halitosis</b> is one of the symptoms of infection. This experiment was published in 1984 in the Australian Medical Journal and is among the most cited articles from the journal.|$|E
25|$|Larger tonsilloliths {{may cause}} {{multiple}} symptoms, including recurrent <b>halitosis,</b> which frequently accompanies a tonsil infection, sore throat, white debris, a bad taste {{in the back}} of the throat, difficulty swallowing, ear ache, and tonsil swelling. A medical study conducted in 2007 found an association between tonsilloliths and bad breath in patients with a certain type of recurrent tonsillitis. Among those with bad breath, 75% of the subjects had tonsilloliths, while only 6% of subjects with normal halitometry values (normal breath) had tonsilloliths. A foreign body sensation may also exist {{in the back of}} the throat. The condition may also be an asymptomatic condition, with detection upon palpating a hard intratonsillar or submucosal mass.|$|E
25|$|Toothpaste is a paste or gel {{dentifrice}} {{used with}} a toothbrush as an accessory to clean and maintain the aesthetics and health of teeth. Toothpaste is used to promote oral hygiene: it serves as an abrasive that aids in removing the dental plaque and food from the teeth, assists in suppressing <b>halitosis,</b> and delivers active ingredients (most commonly fluoride) to help prevent tooth decay (dental caries) and gum disease (gingivitis). Salt and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) are among materials that can be substituted for commercial toothpaste. Toothpaste {{is not intended to}} be swallowed due to the fluoride content, but is generally not very harmful if accidentally swallowed in small amounts; however, one should seek medical attention after swallowing abnormally large amounts.|$|E
25|$|Gum chewing is {{regarded}} as a helpful way to cure <b>halitosis</b> (bad breath). Chewing gum not only helps to add freshness to breath but can aid in removing food particles and bacteria associated with bad breath from teeth. It does this by stimulating saliva, which essentially washes out the mouth. Chewing sugar-free gum for 20 minutes after a meal helps prevent tooth decay, according to the American Dental Association, because the act of chewing the sugar-free gum produces saliva to wash away bacteria, which protects teeth. Chewing gum after a meal replaces brushing and flossing, if that's not possible, to prevent tooth decay and increase saliva production. Chewing gum can also help with the lack of saliva or xerostomia since it naturally stimulates saliva production. Saliva is made of chemicals, such as organic molecules, inorganic ions and macromolecules. 0.5% of saliva deals with dental health, since tooth enamel is made of calcium phosphate, those inorganic ions in saliva help repair the teeth and keep them in good condition. The pH of saliva is neutral, which having a pH of 7 allows it to remineralize tooth enamel. Falling below a pH of 5.5 (which is acidic) causes the saliva to demineralize the teeth.|$|E
500|$|In India, {{the ancient}} texts of Ayurveda (Sanskrit आयुर्वेद) include cubeb in various remedies. Charaka and Sushruta {{prescribe}} a cubeb paste as a mouthwash, {{and the use}} of dried cubebs internally for oral and dental diseases, loss of voice, <b>halitosis,</b> fevers, and cough. Unani physicians use a paste of the cubeb berries externally on male and female genitals to intensify sexual pleasure during coitus. Due to this attributed property, cubeb was called [...] "Habb-ul-Uruus".|$|E
500|$|Common {{marginal}} gingivitis {{in response}} to subgingival plaque is usually a painless condition. However, an acute form of gingivitis/periodontitis, termed acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG), can develop, often suddenly. It is associated with severe periodontal pain, bleeding gums, [...] "punched out" [...] ulceration, loss of the interdental papillae, and possibly also <b>halitosis</b> (bad breath) and a bad taste. Predisposing factors include poor oral hygiene, smoking, malnutrition, psychological stress, and immunosuppression. This condition is not contagious, but multiple cases may simultaneously occur in populations who share the same risk factors (such as students in a dormitory {{during a period of}} examination). ANUG is treated over several visits, first with debridement of the necrotic gingiva, homecare with hydrogen peroxide mouthwash, analgesics and, when the pain has subsided sufficiently, cleaning below the gumline, both professionally and at home. Antibiotics are not indicated in ANUG management unless there is underlying systemic disease.|$|E
2500|$|Intraoral <b>halitosis</b> – [...] {{possibly}} due {{to increased}} activity of halitogenic biofilm on the posterior dorsal tongue (although dysgeusia may cause a complaint of nongenuine <b>halitosis</b> {{in the absence of}} hyposalivation).|$|E

2500|$|Conversely, {{some have}} {{suggested}} that medical conditions which cause genuine odor may sometimes be misdiagnosed as ORS. There are a great many different medical conditions which are reported to potentially cause a genuine odor, and these are usually considered according to the origin of the odor, e.g. <b>halitosis</b> (bad breath), bromhidrosis (body odor), etc. These conditions are excluded before a diagnosis of ORS is made. Although there are a multitude of different publications on topics like <b>halitosis,</b> the symptom is still poorly understood and managed in practice. It is recognized that symptoms such as <b>halitosis</b> can be intermittent, and therefore may not be present {{at the time of the}} consultation, leading to misdiagnosis. Individuals with genuine odor symptoms may present with similar mindset and behavior to persons with ORS. For example, one otolaryngologist researcher noted [...] "behavioral problems such as continuous occupation with oral hygiene issues, obsessive use of cosmetic breath freshening products such as mouthwashes, candies, chewing gums, and sprays, avoiding close contact with other people, and turning the head away during conversation" [...] as part of what was termed [...] "skunk syndrome" [...] in patients with genuine <b>halitosis</b> secondary to chronic tonsillitis. Another author, writing about <b>halitosis,</b> noted that there are generally 3 types of person that complain of halitosis: those with above average odor, those with average or near-average odor who are oversensitive, and those with below average or no odor who believe they have offensive breath. Therefore, in persons with genuine odor complaints, the distress and concern may typically be out of proportion to the reality of the problem. Genuine <b>halitosis</b> has been described as a social barrier between the individual and friends, relatives, partners and colleagues, and may negatively alter self-esteem and quality of life. Similar psychosocial problems are reported in other conditions which cause genuine odor symptoms. In the literature on <b>halitosis,</b> emphasis is frequently placed on multiple consultations to reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, and also asking the individual to have a reliable confidant accompany them to the consultation who can confirm the reality of the reported symptom. ORS patients are unable to provide such confidants as they have no objective odor.|$|E
2500|$|In modern times, {{commercial}} advertising pressures {{have altered the}} public's attitude towards problems such as <b>halitosis,</b> which have taken on greater negative psychosocial sequelae as a result. For example, in the United States, a poll reported that 55–75 million citizens consider bad breath a [...] "principal concern" [...] during social encounters.|$|E
2500|$|According to its advocates, nasal {{irrigation}} promotes good sinus and nasal health. Patients {{with chronic}} sinusitis including symptoms of facial pain, headache, <b>halitosis,</b> cough, anterior rhinorrhea (watery discharge) and nasal congestion are reported often to find nasal irrigation to provide relief. In published studies, [...] "daily hypertonic saline nasal irrigation improves sinus-related quality of life, decreases symptoms, and decreases medication use {{in patients with}} frequent sinusitis", and irrigation is recommended as an adjunctive treatment for chronic sinonasal symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|Small {{amounts of}} {{hydrogen}} sulfide occur in crude petroleum, but natural gas can contain up to 90%. Volcanoes and some hot springs (as well as cold springs) emit some , where it probably arises via the hydrolysis of sulfide minerals, i.e. MS + [...] → MO + [...] Hydrogen sulfide can be present naturally in well water, {{often as a}} result of the action of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Hydrogen sulfide is created by the human body in small doses through bacterial breakdown of proteins containing sulfur in the intestinal tract. It is also produced in the mouth (<b>halitosis).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Salivary {{flow rate}} is {{decreased}} during sleep, which {{may lead to}} a transient sensation of dry mouth upon waking. This disappears with eating or drinking or with oral hygiene. When associated with <b>halitosis,</b> this is sometimes termed [...] "morning breath". Dry mouth is also a common sensation during periods of anxiety, probably owing to enhanced sympathetic drive. Dehydration is known to cause hyposalivation, the result of the body trying to conserve fluid. Physiologic age-related changes in salivary gland tissues {{may lead to a}} modest reduction in salivary output and partially explain the increased prevalence of xerostomia in older people. However, polypharmacy is thought to be the major cause in this group, with no significant decreases in salivary flow rate being likely to occur through aging alone.|$|E
2500|$|Garlic {{is known}} to cause bad breath (<b>halitosis)</b> and body odor, {{described}} as a pungent [...] "garlicky" [...] smell to sweat. This is caused by allyl methyl sulfide (AMS). AMS is a volatile liquid which is absorbed into the blood during the metabolism of garlic-derived sulfur compounds; from the blood it travels to the lungs (and {{from there to the}} mouth, causing bad breath; see garlic breath) and skin, where it is exuded through skin pores. Washing the skin with soap is only a partial and imperfect solution to the smell. Studies have shown sipping milk {{at the same time as}} consuming garlic can significantly neutralize bad breath. Mixing garlic with milk in the mouth before swallowing reduced the odor better than drinking milk afterward. Plain water, mushrooms and basil may also reduce the odor; the mix of fat and water found in milk, however, was the most effective.|$|E
2500|$|... 95% {{of persons}} with ORS engage {{in at least one}} {{excessive}} hygiene, grooming or other related repetitive practice in an attempt to alleviate, mask and monitor the perceived odor. This {{has been described as a}} contrite reaction, and repetitive, counterphobic, [...] "safety", ritual or compulsive behaviors. Despite these measures, the odor symptom is reported to still offend other people. Example ORS behaviors include: repetitive showering and other grooming behaviors, excessive tooth brushing, or tongue scraping (a treatment for <b>halitosis),</b> repeated smelling of oneself to check for any odor, over-frequent bathroom use, attempts to mask the odor, with excessive use of deodorants, perfumes, mouthwash, mint, chewing gum, scented candles, and soap; changing clothes (e.g. underwear), multiple times per day, frequent washing of clothes, wearing several layers of clothing, wrapping feet in plastic, wearing garments marketed as odor-reducing, eating special diets, dietary supplements (e.g. intended to reduce flatulence odor), repeatedly seeking reassurance from others that there is no odor, although the negative response is usually interpreted instead as politeness rather than truth, and avoidance behaviors such habitually sitting at a distance from others, minimizing movement in an attempt [...] "not to spread the odor", keeping the mouth closed and avoiding talking or talking with a hand in front of the mouth.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} serious oral {{condition}} that can arise is that of oral cancer. However, smoking also increases the risk for various other oral diseases, some almost completely exclusive to tobacco users. The National Institutes of Health, through the National Cancer Institute, determined in 1998 that [...] "cigar smoking causes a variety of cancers including cancers of the oral cavity (lip, tongue, mouth, throat), esophagus, larynx, and lung." [...] Pipe smoking involves significant health risks, particularly oral cancer. Roughly half of periodontitis or inflammation around the teeth cases are attributed to current or former smoking. Smokeless tobacco causes gingival recession and white mucosal lesions. Up to 90% of periodontitis patients who are not helped by common modes of treatment are smokers. Smokers have significantly greater loss of bone height than nonsmokers, and the trend can be extended to pipe smokers to have more bone loss than nonsmokers. Smoking has been proven {{to be an important}} factor in the staining of teeth. <b>Halitosis</b> or bad breath is common among tobacco smokers. Tooth loss {{has been shown to be}} 2 to 3 times higher in smokers than in non-smokers. In addition, complications may further include leukoplakia, the adherent white plaques or patches on the mucous membranes of the oral cavity, including the tongue.|$|E

5000|$|More recently, the {{portable}} gas chromatograph, [...] "OralChroma" [...] has been recommended {{in the diagnosis}} of <b>halitosis,</b> [...] as the Halimeter does not detect dimethyl sulfide, which is thought {{by some to be}} elevated in extraoral causes of <b>halitosis.</b> [...] The OralChroma detects dimethyl sulfide in a semi objective manner, and hence is able to differentiate between oral malodor (intraoral <b>halitosis)</b> and extra-oral <b>halitosis.</b> The halimeter is therefore not indicated if extra-oral <b>halitosis</b> is suspected (its use will only be able to rule out intra-oral <b>halitosis),</b> but is useful for diagnosis and clinical monitoring of intra-oral <b>halitosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|In about 90% {{of genuine}} <b>halitosis</b> cases, {{the origin of}} the odor is in the mouth itself. This is known as intra-oral <b>halitosis,</b> oral malodor or oral <b>halitosis.</b>|$|E
