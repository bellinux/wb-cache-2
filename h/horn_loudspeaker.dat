2500|$|A <b>horn</b> <b>{{loudspeaker}}</b> is {{a loudspeaker}} or loudspeaker element which uses an acoustic horn {{to increase the}} overall efficiency of the driving element(s). A common form (right) consists of a compression driver which produces sound waves with a small metal diaphragm vibrated by an electromagnet, attached to a horn, a flaring duct to conduct the sound waves to the open air. Another type is a woofer driver mounted in a loudspeaker enclosure which is divided by internal partitions to form a zigzag flaring duct which functions as a horn; this type is called a folded horn speaker. The horn serves to improve the coupling efficiency between the speaker driver and the air. The horn {{can be thought of}} as an [...] "acoustic transformer" [...] that provides impedance matching between the relatively dense diaphragm material and the less-dense air. The result is greater acoustic output power from a given driver.|$|E

25|$|<b>Horn</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> {{are used}} in many audio applications. The drivers in <b>horn</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> can be very small, even for bass {{frequencies}} where conventional loudspeakers {{would need to be}} very large for equivalent performance. <b>Horn</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> can be designed to reproduce a wide range of frequencies using a single, small driver; to some extent these can be designed without requiring a crossover. Lowther, Fostex, and Goodmans are firms which have produced such designs.|$|R

50|$|Some audiophiles use <b>horn</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> for audio reproduction, {{while others}} eschew horn systems for their {{harmonic}} resonances, finding in them an unpleasant form of distortion. Since {{there are a}} variety of horn designs (of differing length, material, and taper, as well as different drivers) it is, to some extent, impossible to give such blanket characterizations to <b>horn</b> <b>loudspeakers.</b> Audiophiles using low power amplifiers, sometimes in the five to twenty-five watt range, may find the typically high efficiency of <b>horn</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> an especially attractive feature because it makes it possible to reach playable music levels. Conversely, the high sensitivity can also make any background noise present at the amplifier outputs noticeably worse at the distances of a typical living room.|$|R
2500|$|Concert venues {{often use}} large arrays of <b>horn</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> for {{high-volume}} bass reproduction ("bass bins" [...] or subwoofers), {{in order to}} provide bass that concertgoers can not only hear but feel. Combining multiple <b>horn</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> in an array affords the same benefits as having a single horn with a greater mouth area: the low frequency cut-off extends lower as the horn mouth gets larger, and the array has the greater output power of multiple drivers.|$|R

25|$|<b>Horn</b> <b>{{loudspeaker}}s</b> are {{the oldest}} form of loudspeaker system. The use of horns as voice-amplifying megaphones dates {{at least to}} the 17th century, and horns were used in mechanical gramophones as early as 1857. <b>Horn</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> use a shaped waveguide in front of or behind the driver to increase the directivity of the loudspeaker and to transform a small diameter, high pressure condition at the driver cone surface to a large diameter, low pressure condition {{at the mouth of the}} horn. This improves the acousticâ€”electro/mechanical impedance match between the driver and ambient air, increasing efficiency, and focusing the sound over a narrower area.|$|R

Ralph Heinz eventually became senior vice-president of R&D and patented a method of arraying loudspeakers for better phase coherency in 1994.

5000|$|In 1986, Gunness {{developed}} the EV HP series of <b>horn</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> {{based on the}} constant directivity (CD) characteristics described by EV engineer Don Keele in the mid-1970s. Gunness recognized that relatively large 2-inch (51 mm) horn throats, commonly used for greater SPL, produced an undesirable narrowing of the output pattern above 10 kHz. His patented design used two longitudinal ribs or vanes to form three [...] "pseudo horns" [...] within the horn flare.|$|R

In 1941 the Altec Services Company purchased the nearly bankrupt Lansing Manufacturing Company and melded the two names, forming the Altec Lansing Corporation, and with the manufacturing capabilities of the former Lansing Manufacturing Company, they quickly expanded into manufacturing <b>horn</b> <b>loudspeakers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Brothers Roy and Gene Clair {{grew up in}} Lititz, Pennsylvania, {{where their}} parents owned a grocery store. Their father bought them a small public address system in 1955 which they started to rent out to bands, schools, and churches. It {{consisted}} of a <b>horn</b> <b>loudspeaker,</b> a Stromberg-Carlson integrated preamplifier, a 35-watt power amp, and a microphone. Money they earned went to buying more equipment. Through high school, college and after they continued to rent it out and add to it.|$|E
50|$|In 1929, Western Electric {{entered as}} a market {{competitor}} for early cinema sound systems. It created the Western Electric Universal Base, a device by which early silent cinema projectors could {{be adapted to}} screen sound films. Western Electric designed a wide-audio-range <b>horn</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> for cinemas. This {{was estimated to be}} nearly 50% efficient, thus allowing a cinema to be filled with sound from a 3-watt amplifier. This was an important breakthrough in 1929 because high-powered audio valves (tubes) were not generally available.|$|E

The throats were sometimes outside on the lawn, or in the basement. With the coming of stereo in the 1960s, this approach was rarely seen. Many loudspeaker buyers and do-it-yourself loudspeaker fans sought smaller designs for aesthetic reasons.|$|R
