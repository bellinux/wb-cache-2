500|$|... "Live While We're Young" [...] {{is a song}} by English-Irish boy band One Direction, {{released}} as the lead single from their second studio album, Take Me Home (2012). Written by Savan Kotecha and its producers, Rami Yacoub and Carl Falk, the number was released by Syco Records on 28 September 2012. Falk, Kotecha, and Yacoub had collaboratively helmed One Direction's previous hits, [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] and [...] "One Thing". The track is an uptempo, upbeat bubblegum pop song which features rock undertones, vocal harmonies, hand claps, prominent electric guitar riffs, and repetitive synthesizers. The chorus of the song is predominantly featured alongside the bridge, and is backed by wordless chants. Its opening guitar riff bears similarities with The Clash's 1982 single, [...] "Should <b>I</b> <b>Stay</b> or Should I Go".|$|E

500|$|... "Live While We're Young" [...] is an uptempo, upbeat bubblegum pop song which {{features}} rock undertones, vocal harmonies, hand claps, prominent electric guitar riffs, and repetitive synthesizers, {{reminiscent of the}} musical structures of their debut album. The opening guitar riff has been noted as {{similar to that of}} The Clash song [...] "Should <b>I</b> <b>Stay</b> or Should I Go" [...] (1982). According to Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, the guitar is played thrice between the riff with the plectrum stroking the strings, while it is pressed. One note in the chord is changed, which Petridis surmised was probably to avoid paying any royalty to the Clash. Sam Lansky of Idolator noted that the song is musically similar to their breakthrough hit [...] "What Makes You Beautiful". In contrast to One Direction's previous singles, the lead vocals are predominantly sung by Zayn Malik.|$|E

[...] The opening guitar riff of [...] "Live While We're Young" [...] has been noted as {{similar to that of}} The Clash's 1982 single, [...] "Should <b>I</b> <b>Stay</b> or Should I Go", by some critics. According to Petridis, the guitar is played thrice between the riff with the plectrum stroking the strings, while it is pressed. One note in the chord is changed, which Petridis surmised was probably to avoid paying any royalty to the Clash.

500|$|In June 2008, Rap-Up {{originally}} {{reported the}} song as [...] "Turn Off", while Hilson was playing it at Interscope-Geffen-A Records' second annual [...] "Creme of the Crop" [...] post-BET Awards dinner on June 25, 2008. Then an unmastered version of [...] "Turn Off" [...] was leaked online in September 2008. After selecting the predominantly pop-sounding [...] "Energy" [...] and [...] "Return the Favor", Hilson selected [...] "Turnin Me On" [...] as In a Perfect World...s third single. When asked {{in an interview}} with That Grape Juice if choosing the song was a conscious effort, since the song had a different sound than the previous singles, Hilson responded, [...] "Absolutely! I mean, there’s another side of me. I’m from Decatur, Georgia and that is a predominantly black neighbourhood with a lot of lower-class and some middle-class neighbourhoods. I guess that is the song that probably properly describes the type of girl I am, in relation to where I’m from. So yeah, it was definitely a conscious effort to make sure that <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> close to home on some records." ...|$|E

We thought something was going to go down, like he was scouting us out." [...] The Rainmen promptly left on the team bus, and it was considered a motive for forfeiting the game. On the morning of May 2, two days after the brawl, Rainmen guard Forrest Fisher wrote on Twitter that he had been kicked out of his apartment without warning.

[...] Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times summarised it as a [...] "characteristically peppy piece of high-gloss party pop." [...] Lansky praised its effectiveness and thought it was [...] "perfectly tailored to top the charts." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Popdust acknowledged that [...] "the song is smart to swipe the guitar-only opening pattern from The Clash's [...] "Should <b>I</b> <b>Stay</b> or Should I Go?"—akin to [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] lifting the [...] "Summer Nights" [...] beginning—calling on pop history to get you excited for the song before you even really realise why." [...] Unterberger further highlighted the small lyrical plays for conveying [...] "an incredible amount of urgency and fun without much clunky verbage , making singing along something of an inevitability."

[...] According to the Sunday Mirror, [...] "Trouble" [...] was inspired by Lewis' break-up with her childhood sweetheart Lou Al-Chamaa. Lyrics which reference her relationship with Chamaa include the lines: [...] "I told you never to get used to me, <b>I</b> <b>stay</b> awake while you fall asleep. I'm a whole lot of trouble, we're in a whole lot of trouble. You shout louder than you used to, and you hold on tighter in the bedroom." [...] During an interview with Digital Spy, Lewis further explained that she was inspired and influenced by British trip-hop pioneers Massive Attack. The Suns showbiz editor Gordan Smart also picked up on the similarities, noting that [...] "Trouble" [...] sounds similar to [...] "Unfinished Sympathy" [...] (1991) and [...] "Teardrop" [...] (1998) by Massive Attack. [...] "Trouble" [...] drew comparisons to Sandé's own singles; according to Michael Cragg from The Guardian, [...] "Trouble" [...] was much like [...] "Heaven" [...] (2011) while MSN's Danielle Cheeseman compared it to Sandé collaboration with Naughty Boy, [...] "Daddy" [...] (2011).|$|E
