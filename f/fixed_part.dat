500|$|Liturgical {{calendars}} {{began to}} be developed in Christianity around the fourth century, with the church calendar {{as it is known}} today coming into full development in the period of the medieval sacramentaries. [...] While Sunday had long been established in the weekly calendar, festivals such as Easter and Christmas were also a <b>fixed</b> <b>part</b> of the calendar by this time. [...] The ninth century also saw the inclusion of numerous saints in the calendar (a practice already begun by the second century), even to the point that normal Sunday propers were taking place over those normally appointed for Sunday. [...] The Lutheran calendar owes much to the proliferation of commemorations of the medieval calendars of Western Christianity.|$|E

60|$|I {{have arrived}} at the {{conviction}} that no comparison of crania is worth very much, that is not founded upon {{the establishment of a}} relatively fixed base line, to which the measurements, in all cases, must be referred. Nor do I think it is a very difficult matter to decide what that base line should be. The parts of the skull, like those {{of the rest of the}} animal framework, are developed in succession the base of the skull is formed before its sides and roof; it is converted into cartilage earlier and more completely than the sides and roof: and the cartilaginous base ossifies, and becomes soldered into one piece long before the roof. I conceive then that the base of the skull may be demonstrated developmentally to be its relatively <b>fixed</b> <b>part,</b> the roof and sides being relatively moveable.|$|E

Holsman has promised to take you on." [...] Another classmate wrote {{to know if he}} did not want to go into a land deal on the Gulf of Mexico. A girl asked: [...] "Are you to be in New York this winter? I am. I've decided to go into this Suffrage Movement." [...] And so, one by one, the threads which bound him to Eastern city life re-spun their filaments. After all, this Colorado outing, even though it should last two years, would only be a vacation--his real life was in the cities of the East.

60|$|However much we may all {{suffer through}} marriage, {{most of us}} think so little about it that we regard it as a <b>fixed</b> <b>part</b> {{of the order of}} nature, like gravitation. Except for this error, which may be {{regarded}} as constant, we use the word with reckless looseness, meaning a dozen different things by it, and yet always assuming that to a respectable man it can have only one meaning. The pious citizen, suspecting the Socialist (for example) of unmentionable things, and asking him heatedly whether he wishes to abolish marriage, is infuriated by a sense of unanswerable quibbling when the Socialist asks him what particular variety of marriage he means: English civil marriage, sacramental marriage, indissoluble Roman Catholic marriage, marriage of divorced persons, Scotch marriage, Irish marriage, French, German, Turkish, or South Dakotan marriage. In Sweden, one of the most highly civilized countries in the world, a marriage is dissolved if both parties wish it, without any question of conduct. That is what marriage means in Sweden. In Clapham that is what they call by the senseless name of Free Love. In the British Empire we have unlimited Kulin polygamy, Muslim polygamy limited to four wives, child marriages, and, nearer home, marriages of first cousins: all of them abominations {{in the eyes of many}} worthy persons. Not only may the respectable British champion of marriage mean any of these widely different institutions; sometimes he does not mean marriage at all. He means monogamy, chastity, temperance, respectability, morality, Christianity, anti-socialism, and a dozen other things that have no necessary connection with marriage. He often means something that he dare not avow: ownership of the person of another human being, for instance. And he never tells the truth about his own marriage either to himself or any one else.|$|E
