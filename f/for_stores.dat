5|$|The {{shopping}} {{levels in}} the Clal Building are exceptionally large, with space <b>for</b> <b>stores</b> and a cinema.

Several banks of elevators access upper-floor offices.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's {{archipelago}} frigates provided better {{protection for}} their crew than the galleys they replaced, {{and up to}} three times the capacity <b>for</b> <b>stores</b> and provisions. They could operate in the narrow, shallow waters around skerries in all weathers and in open water {{in all but the}} worst storms. They had a deeper draft than galleys, but considerably shallower draft than traditional sailing warships. The new ship types also increased the archipelago fleet's firepower, provided it with better defensive capabilities, and made possible more efficient fire support in amphibious operations.|$|E
5|$|The keep has {{a central}} newel staircase, linking the basement, ground and first floors. When first built, the {{garrison}} would have {{lived on the}} ground floor of the keep, the first floor being used by the captain, and the basement <b>for</b> <b>stores.</b> The ground floor is subdivided by radial walls and originally would have been further subdivided by partitions; the original ovens and fireplace survive. The first floor mainly dates from the 1720s, although some Tudor elements remain. There is a wooden lantern structure on the top of the keep that contains a bell dating from 1655 and early 18th-century graffiti. The keep's gun embrasures were converted to form sash windows in the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the number}} of pack animals and {{carriers}} was limited, the requirements <b>for</b> <b>stores</b> and supplies of all types, including rations, ammunition, ordnance, signals equipment and medical supplies, were submitted to 7th Division headquarters, which allocated movement priorities. One of Richardson's first actions was to obtain more saddlery for the pack horses. He also acquired five more American jeeps to augment the five that had been working the jeep track. The original five {{were found to be}} in poor condition, and needed overhaul. While the 25th Infantry Brigade was conducting operations in the Imita Ridge area, the carry was short, {{and despite the fact that}} there were no suitable air dropping zones, the supply situation was good. As the Australians began advancing toward Kokoda again in October, the supply line became steadily longer, and the demand for carriers more acute.|$|E
5|$|Within the week, {{they had}} a working game written in Adobe Flash's ActionScript 2. The two agreed to {{complete}} it out as a game they could release on Steam though with no expectations of sales. Completion of the game from the prototype to the finished state took about 3 months with part-time development. During this time, they discovered there were several limitations on the {{size and scope of}} both Flash and ActionScript that limited how much they could do with the game, but continued to use the tools as to release the title. McMillen said that because they were not worried about sales, they were able to work with Valve to release the game without fears of censorship or having to seek an ESRB rating. Releasing through Steam also enabled them to update the game freely, several times on its initial release, an aspect that they could not do with other consoles without significant cost to themselves. They did release without significant end-user testing, as it would have taken several hundreds of users to go through all the various combinations of items that a player could collect, and McMillen recognized they had released the title with their buyers being playtesters for them. A week after the Steam release, McMillen released a demo version via the website Newgrounds. Merge Games produced a physical edition that included the game, soundtrack, and a poster, <b>for</b> <b>stores</b> in the United Kingdom in 2012.|$|E

25|$|By 14 November 1912 {{the railway}} timetables, {{drawn up by}} Harper’s MO1, were ready, {{after two years of}} work. A joint Admiralty-War Office committee, {{including}} representatives of the merchant shipping industry, met fortnightly from February 1913, and produced a workable scheme by spring 1914. In the event the transport of the BEF from just three ports (Southampton for troops, Avonmouth for mechanical transport and Newhaven <b>for</b> <b>stores)</b> would proceed smoothly. Brian Bond argued that Wilson’s greatest achievement as DMO was the provision of horses and transport and other measures which allowed mobilisation to proceed smoothly.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} his retirement, {{he served as a}} colonel in the Army Reserves, briefly published a pulp magazine and had an interest in automatic alarm signals <b>for</b> <b>stores</b> and businesses. In 1933, Enright was employed by the federal government during the Great Depression to set up an enforcement division for the National Recovery Administration. He also became the director of the United Service Detective Bureau, a position he held until his death.

25|$|In all 108 {{ships were}} at La Coruna, most others would join after departing from other ports. By October 1 the fleet {{consisted}} of 136 ships of 34,080 tons, {{of these were}} 44 royal galleons, of an aggregate tonnage of 12,686 tons; 16 merchantmen, of 5880 tons, 52 German and Flemish hulks <b>for</b> <b>stores,</b> of 15,514 tons, and 24 caravels, pinnaces and barks. 8,634 soldiers, 4,000 sailors, a total of 12,634 men and 300 horses. In this squadron of 32 Andalusia troopships included Carlos de Amésquita who had raided Cornwall two years earlier. These carried the elite Spanish military units known as tercios, many were from the Spanish domains in Italy such as Naples and Lombardy and had rarely been beaten in battle.|$|E
25|$|The new {{demand for}} beef {{as a result}} of the {{establishment}} of goldfields, the growth of the sugar industry, the establishment of ports and a run of fair seasons restarted squatting in north Queensland. This second wave of expansion, from 1874, created a demand <b>for</b> <b>stores</b> and breeders not only in north Queensland but in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. While this eased the pastoralists' financial situation in the short run, it exacerbated the problem in the long term as the grossly oversupplied market caused extremely low cattle prices at the end of the 1870s. By 1880 north Queensland cattle numbers were estimated at 450,000 - almost three times the 1874 figure. The Townsville boiling down works re-opened in 1880 to deal with the excess.|$|E

25|$|Arriving at Plymouth on 12 March, the 11th BAC {{establishment}} was {{to include}} dedicated General Service (GS) ammunition wagons (with limber), one wagon per howitzer, and one GS wagon <b>for</b> <b>stores,</b> {{with at least}} 132 horses (both riding and draft, using six per wagon). The Column’s 'operational' task was to have available (carry) a constant supply, and bring forward (on-call), forty-eight rounds per howitzer, to a Firing Battery’s entrenched position, or to supply it to the Battery’s own ammunition wagon lines. Working mostly at night, moving forward, the BAC ammunition wagons were interchangeable with a Firing Batteries own ammunition wagons (one per gun), so full wagons could be easily 'dropped-off', being unhooked and taken away for reloading, a howitzer battery looking to 'always have' available 108 rounds.|$|E
25|$|Other loads {{included}} furniture (often second hand), pianos, a parlor suites, watermelons, fish (such as shad and herring), {{as well as}} transporting {{items such}} as flour or molasses to sell to lockkeepers, {{as some of the}} lockkeepers in remote areas needed the boats to bring their supplies. Cement from the Round Top Mill above Hancock was also shipped to Georgetown. Some would pole across the river at Dam No. 2 to get wood, cross-ties, bark (used in tanning), and sometimes grain. Other loads, often carried upstream, included 600 empty barrels in a boat, taken to Shepherdstown to load cement, lumber, fertilizer, and general merchandise <b>for</b> <b>stores</b> along the canal, as well as oysters in barrels, complete materials to build a house, ear corn, and even extra mules.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} {{depression of the}} early 1890s resulted in {{a reduction in the}} size of the colony's permanent artillery. In addition drastic cuts in payments <b>for</b> <b>stores,</b> grants and training also occurred. By the middle of the decade Tasmania's permanent artillery was basically ineffective, having been reduced to just eight men. The colony's artillery holdings the following year were four 12-pounder breech loaded (BL) guns and two 2.5-inch rifled muzzle loaders (RMLs). Despite the lack of government funding, however, between 1895 and 1897 volunteer units held a number of unpaid training camps. In 1897, a reorganisation of Tasmania's infantry saw the creation of the Tasmanian Regiment of Infantry, which was established with three battalions. Government funded training recommenced in 1898 and the following year a mounted infantry force and a medical corps was formed.|$|E

25|$|On 20 July 1942, when Rommel {{was driving}} towards Egypt, General Headquarters (GHQ) ordered the {{construction}} of two bridges across the Nile to allow Eighth Army's armour to manoeuvre to the south if the Cairo defences were attacked. The task was assigned to X CTRE under Lt-Col E.N. Bickford. The sites chosen were at Helwan and Wasta, where the widths to be bridged were 2688 feet (820m) and 2760 feet (840m) respectively, {{and the difference between}} high and low water was about 22 feet (7m). Pontoons were unavailable, so local feluccas were used to make a bridge of boats. 572nd Field Company took on the bridge at Helwan with the assistance of a Seychelles Pioneer Company, while 571st Field Company with a Mauritius Pioneer Company built the Wasta bridge. 570th Field Park Company was responsible <b>for</b> <b>stores</b> and welding. In the event, Rommel's final drive was halted at the Battle of Alam Halfa, the Cairo defences were not required, and the bridges were dismantled in November.|$|E
25|$|Pathmark {{was a large}} New York-area {{chain that}} was one of A's major {{competitors}} when it was acquired in 2007. Pathmark, originally known as Supermarkets General, was formed in 1956 as a subgroup of the Wakefern co-operative known as ShopRite. When Supermarkets General broke from ShopRite in 1968, it converted its 81 stores to Pathmark. By 1977, Pathmark started to build larger stores with pharmacies. To overcome a hostile takeover in 1987, Pathmark's management instituted a leveraged buyout of $2.7 billion that committed it to make large debt payments. In 2000, Pathmark entered bankruptcy; after it was reorganized, Yucaipa Holding purchased 40% of Pathmark for $150 million. At the time of its 2007 purchase by A, Pathmark operated 141 stores and had a capitalization of $634 million. Many Pathmark stores were still in operation when A began liquidation. The brand has been sold to Foodtown, but is not currently in use <b>for</b> <b>stores.</b>|$|E
