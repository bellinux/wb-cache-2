50|$|Forty years later, the {{production}} techniques pioneered by Citroën had permitted the auto-industry {{to become one}} of the most important sectors in the industrialising economy, and auto-production had become massively labour-intensive. The artisanal skills of the Paris carriage maker were no longer of much relevance, however. Commercial success for the 2CV and (more recently) DS models left Citroën desperately short of production capacity in their cramped Paris site, and the decision was taken to build a new <b>greenfield</b> <b>plant.</b> The Rennes location was chosen in 1958 on account of its abundant supply of available labour and the low wages in an area where the economy was heavily dependent on the primary sector. Farming in the 1950s was beginning to shed labour fast as more and more agricultural tasks were transferred from men and women to machines. Citroën's decision to build their new plant on a Greenfield site in an area still dominated by agriculture mirrored auto-industry developments taking place at this time in Michigan and several adjacent states in the USA.|$|E

General Mills continuously looks to maintain a competitive advantage in the oat supply chain because it is important for strategic short and long term planning. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze supply chain scenarios to determine where future investments should be made. The analysis looks at an existing location, a refurbished location and a Greenfield site. The analysis projects income statements and net cash flows to determine the conclusions using Net Present Value. The question answered is "Should the company continue to invest in the existing supply chain or should it look to different alternatives {{in the form of a}} refurbished or <b>Greenfield</b> <b>plant</b> site for production of oat flour?" The analysis found important relationships between the variables that can influence net cash flow and ultimately NPV.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of a biorefinery concept through the integration of new biomass conversion processes with existing industrial plants offers a potential for high overall biomass-to-product efficiencies and cost-effective production. To reach this potential, {{a high degree of}} process integration is essential. This implies that there will be strong interconnections between the different processing units in the original plant and the new biorefinery process, and thereby a risk of operability difficulties. Consequently, {{there is a need to}} consider operational objectives, together with economic and environmental ones in biorefinery integration design problems. This paper focuses on the operability of an industrial plant that is retrofitted with a new biorefinery process. The existing industrial plant is considered to be an energy-intensive, mature, commodity-producing plant and retrofit of this plant is necessary for enabling efficient integration and synergy effects of co-locating the biorefinery process with the existing process, instead of building a stand-alone <b>greenfield</b> <b>plant.</b> A wide range of operability issues associated with the integration of the biorefinery is considered, including flexibility, controllability, and reliability. The main issues that affect the operability when integrating a new biorefinery process to an existing industrial plant are investigated. Core operability issues to consider in the design and evaluation of future biorefinery concepts are highlighted and opportunities for further research and methodology development activities are identified...|$|E

The IPR method emphasizes the use of existing unit processes combined with available low-tech modifications to eliminate greenhouse gases from coal based power plants.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which the rising relative energy prices of the past decade have influenced managerial decisions in U. S. iron and steel manufacturing. Efforts at energy conservation, as well as opportunities for short-run substitutions among energy sources, were constrained mainly by existing process technology. The actual pattern of substitution can be explained to a large extent by changes in techniques. Decisions concerning such investments were guided by many factors, among which considerations of energy savings played only a minor role. This observation can be explained by the fact that, although the industry in the aggregate is a prodigious consumer of energy, energy costs at any one production stage are but a small fraction of total variable costs. Integrated <b>greenfield</b> <b>plants</b> embodying state-of-the-art technology would achieve much higher levels of energy efficiency than are currently realized, but such new plants are unlikely to be built in the United States, under the current conditions of global excess capacity. ...|$|R

The initial analysis of this concept indicates that it will be both technically and economically viable. A unique feature of our greenfields HIPPS concept is that it integrates the operation of a pressurized pyrolyzer and a pulverized fuel-fired boiler/air heater. Once this type of operation is achieved, there are a few different applications of this core technology. Two <b>greenfields</b> <b>plant</b> options are the base case plant and a plant where ceramic air heaters are used to extend the limit of air heating in the HITAF. The greenfields designs can be used for repowering in the conventional sense which involves replacing almost everything in the plant except the steam turbine and accessories.

Making use of both quantitative survey data and qualitative interviews with employees and union officials, we discuss {{the development of a}} range of managerial practices at the workplace level in Poland and the UK often described as lean production techniques. We examine these with respect to their impact on employees' perceptions of the quality of work-life-home-life. While advocates of lean have argued consistently that with the right management cadre in the right place, the positive effects of lean for both employers and employees will prevail, evidence demonstrating higher levels of employee satisfaction in lean regimes is scant. This is not surprising for at least two reasons. In contrast to the ideology of lean, the impact of systems so defined is deleterious to the quality of life at work and to worker health more widely defined including life beyond employment. Furthermore, {{there is some evidence that}} the impact lean may be impacting negatively on worker decisions to take early retirement or to exit the sector.

After the Rose Revolution in 2003, the Georgian society went through significant changes where many challenges were successfully dealt with, including an evident reduction in corruption. Nevertheless, the issue of energy supply continued to be troublesome. An important part of the new energy policy introduced in 2006 was the utilising of domestic hydropower resources. Having one of Europe's largest untapped hydropower potential the Georgian politicians wanted to maximise this opportunity, however, the country did not have the human resources and finances to do so. Following a neoliberal approach where FDI is considered unquestionably beneficial, it was decided to attract FDI so that <b>greenfield</b> hydropower <b>plants</b> would be constructed. This thesis analyses the impacts of FDI in the hydropower sector after 2006, and the main question is in what ways the Georgian government’s search for FDI in the hydropower sector have had an impact on social and environmental aspects of the society.
