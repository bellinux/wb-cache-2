50|$|Carrybar™ - P4CK {{launched}} its new drinks carrier, the CarryBar™, at Twickenham's 90,000 capacity stadium on Saturday 17 November, at the QBE Internationals; England v. Australia match. The unique, patent pending cardboard carrier enables the efficient and easy transportation of four pints of beer. Some 100,000 carriers were produced by Benson Group at its Bardon, Leicestershire, headquarters, with the print-run split between Guinness and Greene King IPA branding. The Korsnäs <b>Kraft</b> <b>Board</b> products were printed, cut and glued prior to flat-pack despatch. The Carrybar employs a unique central bar mechanism to provide {{high levels of}} robustness and stability. All of this is delivered in a packaging solution that uses 33% less material than the nearest competitor.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of novel hybrid materials of cellulose fibres and substrates with nanoparticles, conducting polymers and quantum dots, opens up novel application for new packaging materials and paper based {{products for the}} ‘smart packaging’ and ‘functional products’ areas that are emerging in the paper and packaging industries. Examples of these materials which have been developed here include cellulose fibres and substrates functionalised with magnetic nanoparticles, electrically conducting polypyrrole, and photoluminescent zinc sulfide quantum dots. Such materials were synthesised and then characterised using Alternating Gradient Magnetometry (AGM), Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AA), Cotec Profilometer Measurements, DC Conductivity Measurements, Photoluminescence Spectroscopy (PL), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), SQUID Magnetometry, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Vibrational Sample Magnetometry (VSM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Ferrimagnetic magnetite nanoparticles (particle size 12 - 26 nm) were synthesised by a simple aqueous precipitation method and had a magnetic saturation of approximately 60 emu g⁻¹, a coercive field of approximately 12 - 120 Oe, and a remnant magnetisation of approximately 11 emu g⁻¹. Magnetite coated Kraft fibres (1. 2 – 3. 15 wt. % Fe) were synthesised by adding a colloidal suspension of magnetite nanoparticles to a suspension of Kraft fibres. The fibres retained their inherent properties, such as tensile strength and flexibility, but inherited the magnetic properties of the magnetic nanoparticles. The nanoparticles remained unchanged on bonding - presumably through hydrogen bonding between the surface hydroxyl groups of the cellulose and the oxygen present in the magnetite. Newsprint, <b>Kraft</b> <b>Board</b> and Cotton fabric were coated with polypyrrole using a chemical polymerisation method. SEM shows a complete coating, whereby the fibres are completely encapsulated by the polymer, including individual fibrils. Again, bonding is facilitated through hydrogen bonding between the surface hydroxyl groups of the cellulose and the lone pairs of the nitrogen in the polypyrrole backbone. Samples were doped with p-toluenesulfonic acid to increase conductivity, of which up to 4 S cm⁻¹ was achieved. The samples were coated with magnetite nanoparticles using a starch binder, and tested for their application in EMI shielding. A maximum shielding effectiveness of 43 % in the 1 - 18 GHz range and 47 % in the 16 - 40 GHz range was obtained using cotton fabrics coated with both polypyrrole and magnetite. A synergistic effect is observed on using a polypyrrole and magnetite coating. Photoluminescent ZnS quantum dots, synthesised using an aqueous precipitation method, were doped with Mn²⁺ and Cu²⁺ to achieve emissions at approximately 600 nm (Mn²⁺) and 530 nm (Cu²⁺) on irradiation with UV light. The quantum dots had a particle size of approximately 2 nm, and {{were present in the}} zinc blende phase. Doped ZnS-coated Kraft fibres (5 – 30 wt. % Zn) were synthesised by a number of methods, the most successful being the ‘in-situ’ method, in which a uniform and complete coating was afforded. The fibres retained their inherent properties, such as tensile strength and flexibility, but inherited the photoluminescent properties of the ZnS quantum dots. The quantum dots remained unchanged on bonding - presumably through hydrogen bonding between the surface hydroxyl groups of the cellulose and the sulfur present in the ZnS quantum dots. ZnS quantum dots doped with Mn² and Cu²⁺ were successfully formulated for inkjet printing by capping with mercaptosuccinic acid. Upon irradiation with UV light, emissions at approximately 600 nm (Mn²⁺-doped) and 530 nm (Cu²⁺-doped) were observed. These were successfully inkjet printed in intricate patterns onto a number of substrates, including photographic quality inkjet paper, cotton, and wool...|$|E
50|$|The {{corrugated}} fiberboard {{consists of two}} <b>kraft</b> liner <b>board</b> outer surfaces with a corrugated interior that is bonded together with adhesive or glue. This bonded material provides the necessary strength for the push-pull device to clamp the slip sheet once or twice. There are several disadvantages associated {{with this type of}} slip sheet material including that it is not very durable, moisture resistant, resistant to high humidity or usable in cold storage areas. The advantages associated with this material are low cost, one-way use, and its ability to be moved by a conveyor or lift truck with a slip sheet device.|$|R
40|$|The SAPPI Ngodwana mill is {{the largest}} {{integrated}} pulp and paper mill in Africa and is situated in the Elands River catchment in the Mpumalanga province. A need has arisen at the mill to reduce effluent volumes requiring discharge. The combined mill effluent is currently irrigated onto pastures {{and over the years}} percolation of attenuated effluent has resulted in elevated chloride levels in the Elands River. Elevated chloride levels in the river have in turn impacted on the tobacco farmers downstream of the mill. Reclamation of <b>Kraft</b> Liner <b>Board</b> effluent was identified as a means of reducing the hydraulic load onto the irrigation pastures {{and at the same time}} reduce the intake of fresh water into the mill. Two possible uses for the reclaimed effluent, namely washing of bleached or unbleached pulp, were identified. The major reclaimed water quality variables of concern for re-use are; biodegradable organic material, colour and suspended solids. Approximately 9 months of pilot-scale activated sludge treatment of the effluent demonstrates that sufficient organic material can be removed for re-use, as wash water. Removal of the organic material was not influenced by sludge age in the range 2 to 8 days. A high degree of colour removal was achieved, which is contrary to reports in the literature. Even with the high colour removal achieved, however, insufficient colour was removed to allow washing of bleached pulp. Pulp and paper effluents are often reported to result in filamentous bulking activated sludges. This was confirmed in the testwork. Severe sludge settleability problems were experienced throughout the pilot-scale testwork. Filamentous bulking was identified as the cause of poor sludge settleability and preventative or control strategies would have to be implemented on full-scale.
