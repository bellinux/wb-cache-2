In this work, we propose a novel approach that embeds images into a low dimensional Euclidean space, while preserving local image similarities based on their scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) vectors. We make no neighborhood assumptions in our embedding. Our algorithm can also embed the images in a discrete grid, useful for many visualization tasks. We demonstrate the algorithm on images with known categories and compare our accuracy favorably to those of competing algorithms. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTransposable {{elements}} (TEs) are {{the major}} components of eukaryotic genomes. Their propensity to <b>densely</b> <b>populate</b> {{and in some cases}} invade the genomes of plants and animals is in contradiction with the fact that transposition is strictly controlled by several molecular pathways acting at either transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels. Horizontal transfers, defined as the transmission of genetic material between sexually isolated species, have long been considered as rare phenomena. Here, we show that the horizontal transfers of transposable elements (HTTs) are very frequent in ecosystems. The exact mechanisms of such transfers are not well understood, but species involved in close biotic interactions, like parasitism, show a propensity to exchange genetic material horizontally. We propose that HTTs allow TEs to escape the silencing machinery of their host genome and may therefore be an important mechanism for their survival and their dissemination in eukaryotes...|$|R
