The calculations were published by Czech astronomers Pavel Spurný, Zdeněk Ceplecha, and Jiří Borovička of the Ondřejov Observatory, who specialize in meteor observations. They demonstrated that the swing by the earth significantly altered the meteoroid's orbit. Its aphelion (the farthest it travels from the Sun) and orbital period were lowered to almost half of their original values. The object was initially in a highly <b>inclined</b> <b>orbit</b> (71°) and ended in an orbit with a slightly higher inclination (74°).|$|E
5|$|In 2006, imaging of {{the system}} with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys {{revealed}} {{the presence of a}} secondary dust disk inclined at an angle of about 5° to the main disk and extending at least 130 AU from the star. The secondary disk is asymmetrical: the southwest extension is more curved and less inclined than the northeast. The imaging was not good enough to distinguish between the main and secondary disks within 80 AU of Beta Pictoris, however the northeast extension of the dust disk is predicted to intersect with the main disk at about 30 AU from the star. The secondary disk may be produced by a massive planet in an <b>inclined</b> <b>orbit</b> removing matter from the primary disk and causing it to move in an orbit aligned with the planet.|$|E

Pluto came to be seen as the largest member of a new class of objects, and some astronomers stopped referring to Pluto as a planet. Pluto's eccentric and <b>inclined</b> <b>orbit,</b> while very unusual for a planet in the Solar System, fits in well with the other KBOs.

However, most studies either focus on the orbital plane of the binary or consider <b>inclined</b> circular <b>orbits.</b> Here, we numerically investigate the {{stability of}} a possible planet in the alpha-Centauri AB binary system for S-type orbits in an arbitrary spatial configuration. In particular, we focus on <b>inclined</b> <b>orbits</b> and explore the stability for different eccentricities and orientation angles. We show that large stable and regular regions are present for very eccentric and <b>inclined</b> <b>orbits,</b> corresponding to libration in the Lidov-Kozai resonance.

5|$|The hot-Jupiters and warm-Jupiters {{are thought}} to have {{migrated}} to their current orbits during or following their formation. A number of possible mechanisms for this migration have been proposed. Type I or Type II migration could smoothly decrease the semimajor axis of the planet's orbit resulting in a warm- or hot-Jupiter. Gravitational scattering by other planets onto eccentric orbits with a perihelion near the star followed by the circularization of its orbit due to tidal interactions with the star can leave a planet on a close orbit. If a massive companion planet or star on an <b>inclined</b> <b>orbit</b> was present an exchange of inclination for eccentricity via the Kozai mechanism raising eccentricities and lowering perihelion followed by circularization can also result in a close orbit. Many of the Jupiter sized planets have eccentric orbits which may indicate that gravitational encounters occurred between the planets, although migration while in resonance can also excite eccentricities. The in situ growth of hot Jupiters from closely orbiting super Earths has also been proposed. The cores in this hypothesis could have formed locally or at a greater distance and migrated close to the star.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, Jupiter-sized {{bodies that}} orbit {{too close to}} the {{habitable}} zone but not in it (as in 47 Ursae Majoris), or have a highly elliptical orbit that crosses the habitable zone (like 16 Cygni B) make it very difficult for an independent Earth-like planet to exist in the system. See the discussion of a stable habitable zone above. However, during the process of migrating into a habitable zone, a Jupiter-size planet may capture a terrestrial planet as a moon.

5000|$|Conservation of Lz {{means that}} orbital {{eccentricity}} can be [...] "traded for" [...] inclination. Thus, near-circular, highly <b>inclined</b> <b>orbits</b> can become very eccentric.

500|$|In 2014, {{based on}} {{similarities}} of {{the orbits of}} a group of recently discovered extreme trans-Neptunian objects, astronomers hypothesized the existence of a super-Earth planet, 2 to 15 times the mass of the Earth and beyond 200 AU with possibly a high <b>inclined</b> <b>orbit</b> at some 1500 AU. In 2016, further work showed this unknown distant planet is likely on an inclined, eccentric orbit that goes no closer than about 200 AU and no farther than about 1200 AU from the Sun.

500|$|When the aircraft's SDU {{responds}} to messages sent {{from the ground}} station, it uses the aircraft's navigation system to determine the aircraft's position, track, and ground speed and adjusts the transmit frequency {{to compensate for the}} Doppler shift on the uplink signal, based on the satellite being located in its nominal position in geostationary orbit (35786 km above the equator) at 64.5°E. The initial analysis was calculated with the satellite at its nominal location in geostationary orbit, [...] above the equator at 64.5°E longitude.

500|$|Additionally, {{speculation}} of {{a possible}} trans-Neptunian planet has revolved around the so-called [...] "Kuiper cliff". The Kuiper belt terminates suddenly {{at a distance of}} 48AU from the Sun. Brunini and Melita have speculated that this sudden drop-off may be attributed to the presence of an object with a mass between that of Mars and Earth located beyond 48AU. The presence of an object with a mass similar to that of Mars in a circular orbit at 60AU leads to a trans-Neptunian object population incompatible with observations. For instance, it would severely deplete the plutino population. Astronomers have not excluded the possibility of an object with a mass similar to that of Earth located farther than 100AU with an eccentric and <b>inclined</b> <b>orbit.</b> Computer simulations by Patryk Lykawka of Kobe University have suggested that an object with a mass between 0.3 and 0.7 Earth masses, ejected outward by Neptune early in the Solar System's formation and currently in an elongated orbit between 101 and 200AU from the Sun, could explain the Kuiper cliff and the peculiar detached objects such as Sedna and [...] Although some astronomers, such as Renu Malhotra and David Jewitt, have cautiously supported these claims, others, such as Alessandro Morbidelli, have dismissed them as [...] "contrived".

500|$|The secular {{effects of}} Planet Nine can deliver extreme trans-Neptunian objects into orbits roughly {{perpendicular}} to {{the plane of the}} Solar System. Several objects with high inclinations, greater than 60°, and large semi-major axes, above 250 AU, have been observed. Their high inclination orbits can be generated by a high order secular resonance with Planet Nine involving a linear combination of the orbit's arguments and longitudes of perihelion: Δϖ - 2ω. Objects that reach low eccentricities during their secular evolution can enter this resonance. The resonance causes their eccentricities and inclinations to increase, delivering them into perpendicular orbits with low perihelia where they are more readily observed. The orbits then evolve into retrograde orbits with lower eccentricities after which they pass through a second phase of high eccentricity perpendicular orbits before returning to low eccentricity, low inclination orbits. Unlike the Kozai mechanism this resonance causes objects to reach their maximum eccentricities when in nearly perpendicular orbits. In simulations conducted by Batygin and Brown this evolution was relatively common, with 38% of stable objects undergoing it at least once. Saillenfest et al. also observed this behavior in their study of the secular dynamics of eTNOs and noted that it caused the perihelia to fall below 30 AU for objects with semi-major axes greater than 300 AU, and with Planet Nine in an <b>inclined</b> <b>orbit</b> it could occur for objects with semi-major axes as small as 150 AU.

Tidal heating and disk shocking, the latter sometimes consisting of two shocking events as the cluster moves towards and away from the disk, help remove stars from the cluster. Clusters with <b>inclined</b> <b>orbits</b> at large Rgc have decreased mass loss rates than the non-inclined case, since the strength the disk potential decreases with Rgc.
