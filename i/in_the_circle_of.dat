5|$|Most {{cases of}} SAH {{are due to}} trauma. In 85 percent of cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, the cause is rupture of a cerebral aneurysm—a weakness in the wall {{of one of the}} arteries in the brain that becomes enlarged. They tend to be located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> Willis and its branches. While most cases of SAH are due to bleeding from small aneurysms, larger aneurysms (which are less common) are more likely to rupture. Aspirin also appears to increase the risk.|$|E

25|$|In circulatory anastomoses, many arteries {{naturally}} anastomose {{with each}} other; for example, the inferior epigastric artery and superior epigastric artery, or the anterior and/or posterior communicating arteries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Circle</b> <b>of</b> Willis in the brain. The circulatory anastomosis is further divided into arterial and venous anastomosis. Arterial anastomosis includes actual arterial anastomosis (e.g., palmar arch, plantar arch) and potential arterial anastomosis (e.g. coronary arteries and cortical branch of cerebral arteries). Anastomoses also form alternative routes around capillary beds {{in areas that}} don't need a large blood supply, thus helping regulate systemic blood flow.|$|E

Thus the opening operations were unfavourable, not indeed so far as to require the scheme to be abandoned, but at least, delaying the development until the campaigning season was far advanced.|$|E
25|$|Ovid's first recitation {{has been}} dated to around 25 BC, {{when he was}} eighteen.

In Trist. 4.10.41–54, Ovid mentions friendships with Macer, Propertius, Horace, Ponticus and Bassus (he only barely met Virgil and Tibullus, a fellow member of Messalla's circle whose elegies he admired greatly). Ovid was very popular at the time of his early works, but was later exiled by Augustus in AD 8.|$|E

The albums of sketches and drawings he assembled in Rome supplied him with motifs that he worked into paintings throughout his career.|$|E

25|$|The {{most recent}} critics, {{starting}} from the difficult reconstruction of the entire catalogue of the Gentileschi, tried to give a less reductive reading of the career of Artemisia, placing it more accurately {{in the context of}} the different artistic environments in which the painter actively participated.
