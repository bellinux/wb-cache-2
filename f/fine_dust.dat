5|$|Individuals and {{organizations}} have been reviewing cadmium's bioinorganic aspects for its toxicity. The most dangerous form of occupational exposure to cadmium is inhalation of <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> and fumes, or ingestion of highly soluble cadmium compounds. Inhalation of cadmium fumes can result initially in metal fume fever but may progress to chemical pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, and death.|$|E
5|$|Observations of 55 Cancri A in the {{submillimeter}} {{region of}} the spectrum have thus far failed to detect any associated dust. The upper limit on emissions within 100AU of this star is about 850mJy, at a wavelength of 850μm. This limits the total mass of <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> around the star to less than 0.01% of the Earth's mass. However, this does not exclude {{the presence of an}} asteroid belt or a Kuiper belt equivalent.|$|E

Mulder finds a film of <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> in the garage, which Chuck identifies it as vibhuti, a residual sign of spiritual energy. Golda and three elderly Căluşari mystics conduct a ritual in her room. Meanwhile, during Charlie's appointment with Kosseff, the child goes into convulsions. Kosseff and Maggie see smoke coming from under Golda's door, coming across their ritual. Maggie is horrified, and forces the old men to leave the house. However, Golda grabs Charlie and pulls him into her room {{in an attempt to}} complete the ritual. However, Charlie quickly gains the upper hand and brings a pair of dead chickens back to life and makes them kill her.|$|E

The metal has the unfortunate property of producing a <b>fine</b> <b>dust,</b> causing problems with radiation protection. Cobalt from radiotherapy machines has been a serious hazard when not discarded properly, {{and one of the}} worst radiation contamination accidents in North America occurred in 1984, when a discarded radiotherapy unit containing cobalt-60 was mistakenly disassembled in a junkyard in Juarez, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Railway {{operating}} department undertook trials to improve fleet efficiency. When built, Eastbourne-based No. A629 was fitted with an experimental pulverised fuel burner of German design; {{the experiment was}} terminated when a minor explosion {{was caused by the}} powdered coal coming into contact with sparks thrown from the blastpipe. The experiment also proved that pulverised coal was a false economy, as much of the <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> was sucked through the chimney without combustion taking place. The locomotive was returned to normal coal burning in 1935. In 1947 the class became a test-bed for a government-backed scheme regarding fuelling arrangements in anticipation of a coal shortage. Two of the class, Nos. 1625 and 1797, were converted to oil burning, with more set to follow suit; but the project was abandoned and the two oil burners were reverted to coal-firing before this could take place.|$|E
5|$|Corona Borealis {{is home to}} two {{remarkable}} {{variable star}}s. T Coronae Borealis is a cataclysmic variable star {{also known as the}} Blaze Star. Normally placid around magnitude 10—it has a minimum of 10.2 and maximum of 9.9—it brightens to magnitude 2 in a period of hours, caused by a nuclear chain reaction and the subsequent explosion. T Coronae Borealis {{is one of a handful}} of stars called recurrent novae, which include T Pyxidis and U Scorpii. An outburst of T Coronae Borealis was first recorded in 1866; its second recorded outburst was in February 1946. T Coronae Borealis is a binary star with a red-hued giant primary and a white dwarf secondary, the two stars orbiting each other over a period of approximately 8 months. R Coronae Borealis is a yellow-hued variable supergiant star, over 7000 light-years from Earth, and prototype of a class of stars known as R Coronae Borealis variables. Normally of magnitude 6, its brightness periodically drops as low as magnitude 15 and then slowly increases over the next several months. These declines in magnitude come about as dust that has been ejected from the star obscures it. Direct imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope shows extensive dust clouds out to a radius of around 2000AU from the star, corresponding with a stream of <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> (composed of grains 5nm in diameter) associated with the star's stellar wind and coarser dust (composed of grains with a diameter of around 0.14µm) ejected periodically.|$|E

40|$|Droplet chondrules are {{classified}} {{into three groups}} based on the surface features. The group A chondrules, common in the equilibrated chondrites, {{do not have a}} clear boundary with the matrix. The ambiguity of the surfaces of group A can be explained by adhesion of the matrix materials coarsened during slow cooling. Chondrules in the unequilibrated chondrites belong to groups B and C. Though both groups B and C inherit spherical shapes of the melt droplets, the group B chondrules are characterized by zig-zag surfaces due to crystallization of olivine and pyroxene and/or adhesion of <b>fine</b> <b>dusts.</b> The group C chondrules have defined surfaces. Some of them are abraded by <b>fine</b> <b>dusts</b> into rounded shapes with smooth surfaces. The adhesion and abrasion of chondrules suggest that the accretion processes have occurred successively after the chondrule formation, and that the mechanical interaction between chondrules and dust during the accretion was different among the chemical groups and petrologic types of the chondrites...|$|R

Common gaseous pollutants include carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrogen oxides produced by industry and motor vehicles.

25|$|Olympus Mons is an {{unlikely}} landing location for automated space probes {{in the near}} future. The high elevations preclude parachute-assisted landings because of insufficient atmospheric thickness to slow the spacecraft down. Moreover, Olympus Mons stands {{in one of the}} dustiest regions of Mars. A mantle of <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> covers much of the terrain, obscuring the underlying bedrock and possibly making rock samples hard to come by.

25|$|According to folklore, {{the first}} major shamal {{occurring}} around May 25 {{is known as the}} Al-Haffar, or driller, since it drills huge depressions in desert sand dunes. The second, arriving in early June, coincides with the dawn star, Thorayya (Pleiades), and is therefore named Barih Thorayya. During this event, which is more violent than the others, fishermen usually remain in port because ancient folklore tells them that this wind devours ships. Near the end of June, the last shamal arrives, known as the Al-Dabaran, or the follower. It is violent and continues for several days. Local residents keep doors and windows firmly shut as this shamal includes an all-penetrating <b>fine</b> <b>dust</b> which gets into everything.|$|E
25|$|Routing {{and milling}} are conceptually similar, and end mills {{can be used}} in routers, but routing wood is {{different}} from milling metal in terms of the mechanics involved; the chip formation is different, and the optimal tool geometry is thus different. Routing is properly applied to relatively weak and brittle materials, typically wood. As these materials are weak in small sections, routers may be run at extremely high speeds and so even a small router may cut rapidly. Owing to inertia at these high speeds, the normal wood cutting mechanism of Type I chips cannot take place. The cutter edge angle is blunt, approaching 90°, and so a Type III chip is formed, with the waste material being produced as <b>fine</b> <b>dust.</b> This dust is a respiratory hazard, even in benign materials. The forces against the cutter are light, so routers may be hand-held.|$|E

50|$|To support rapid combustion, {{the dust}} must consist of very small {{particles}} {{with a high}} surface area to volume ratio, thereby making the collective or combined surface area of all the particles very large in comparison to a dust of larger particles.
