5|$|The {{study of}} {{vibrations}} in bikes includes its causes, such as engine balance, wheel balance, ground surface, and aerodynamics; its transmission and absorption; {{and its effects}} on the bike, the rider, and safety. An important factor in any vibration analysis is a comparison of the natural frequencies of the system with the possible driving frequencies of the vibration sources. A close match means mechanical resonance that can result in large amplitudes. A challenge in vibration damping is to create compliance in certain directions (vertically) without sacrificing frame rigidity needed for power transmission and handling (torsionally). Another issue with vibration for the bike is the possibility of failure due to material fatigue Effects of vibration on riders include discomfort, loss of efficiency, <b>Hand-Arm</b> <b>Vibration</b> <b>Syndrome,</b> a secondary form Raynaud's disease, and whole body vibration.

40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} of the hand to tool-induced vibrations {{is associated with the}} occurrence of debilitating conditions such as vibration white finger. The primary aim of this work is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the effects of different aspects of exposure to finger transmitted vibration (FTV) related to operators using hand-held vibrating tools. To achieve this, firstly, a new method for measuring finger transmitted vibration was developed and assessed, including a tool vibration test rig and measurement protocol. The effect on FTV measurement of using a small accelerometer attached to the back of the finger was investigated using 2 D finite element modelling. Comparisons were also made using a laser vibrometer. Analysis showed that the new test rig is capable of measuring FTV at frequencies ranging from 10 to 400 Hz, under different grip force levels, and that adding a small accelerometer mass (0. 3 grams) did not significantly affect measurements. A human participant study then carried out using the new rig. Various characteristic measurements were collected in tandem, including anthropometry, skin characterisation and behaviour under loading to investigate the effect of different factors on FTV. The results showed that FTV varied among individuals and the key finding was that exposure to vibration has a significant effect on finger temperature even for a short period of testing. Anti-vibration (AV) glove materials were investigated using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and tested using human participants. The results showed that the mechanical properties of AV materials change under real world industrial conditions such as excitation frequencies and temperature. Finally, a new artificial test-bed was developed to replicate the transmitted vibration of the index finger. Studies were conducted on a range of 5 test-beds, to allow comparison with the human measurements, including indentation, vibration transmissibility and FE modelling. FE modelling showed that the distribution of dynamic strain was found to be highest in the vasculature region of the finger, indicating that this could be one of the contributing factors of VWF. One of the finger test-bed was selected as best replicating the mechanical properties of the real finger. The artificial test-bed provided better consistency than human participants, for testing parameters, such as grip force, and can be used in future for testing AV gloves with no need for human subjects. ii Further investigations are suggested to be made to enhance the limitations of this project, including material analysis, testing protocol and finite element modelling.

40|$|Exposure to {{mechanical}} vibrations at work (e. g., due to handling powered tools) is {{a potential}} occupational risk as it may cause upper extremity complaints. However, reliable and valid assessment methods for vibration exposure at work are lacking. Measuring <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> objectively is often difficult and expensive, while often used information provided by manufacturers lacks detail. Therefore, a subjective <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> assessment method was tested on validity and inter-observer reliability. In an experimental protocol, sixteen tasks handling powered tools were executed by two workers. <b>Hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> was assessed subjectively by 16 observers according to the proposed subjective assessment method. As a gold standard reference, <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> was measured objectively using a vibration measurement device. Weighted κ's were calculated to assess validity, intra-class-correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to assess inter-observer reliability. Inter-observer reliability of the subjective assessments depicting the agreement among observers can be expressed by an ICC of 0. 708 (0. 511 – 0. 873). The validity of the subjective assessments {{as compared to the}} gold-standard reference can be expressed by a weighted κ of 0. 535 (0. 285 – 0. 785). Besides, the percentage of exact agreement of the subjective assessment compared to the objective measurement was relatively low (i. e., 52 % of all tasks). This study shows that subjectively assessed <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibrations</b> are fairly reliable among observers and moderately valid.

A retrospective and a prospective cohort analysis of data were done. <b>Hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> exposure dose was defined as the product of exposure duration and the weighted <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> exposure value according to ISO 5349 - 1. Results The retrospective/prospective incidence of Raynaud's phenomenon was 16 / 14 per 1000 exposure years among exposed and 2. 4 / 5. 0 per 1000 years among the not exposed. The retrospective dose response curve based on 4 dose classes showed that class 2, 3 and 4 had similar response and showed higher incidence than the not-exposed. The dose with RP response to <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> corresponded to a 10 year A(8) value between 0. 4 – 1. 0 m/s 2.

Methods We searched the Ovid/Medline and the Cochrane Library for articles discussing the etiology of osteonecrosis of the lunate published since the first description of KD in 1910 and up until July 2012 in English, French or German. Literature was classified by the level of evidence presented, the etiopathological hypothesis discussed, and the author's conclusion {{about the role of the}} etiopathological hypothesis. The causal relationship between KD and <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> was elucidated by the Bradford Hill criteria. Results A total of 220 references was found. Of the included 152 articles, 140 (92 %) reached the evidence level IV (case series). The four most frequently discussed factors were negative ulnar variance (n= 72; 47 %), primary arterial ischemia of the lunate (n= 63; 41 %), trauma (n= 63; 41 %) and <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> (n= 53; 35 %). The quality of the cohort studies on <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> did not permit a meta-analysis to evaluate the strength of an association to KD. Evidence for the lack of consistency, plausibility and coherence of the 4 most frequently discussed etiopathologies was found.

50|$|Because workers {{maintain}} the same posture over long work days and often several years, even natural postures like standing {{can lead to}} MSDs like low back pain, but postures which are less natural like twisting or tension in the upper body are typically contributors {{to the development of}} MSDs because of the unnatural biomechanical load of these postures. There is evidence that posture contributes to MSDs of the neck, shoulder, and back. Repeated motion is another risk factor for MSDs of occupational origin because workers can perform the same movements repeatedly {{over long periods of time}} (e.g. typing leading to carpal tunnel syndrome), which can wear on the joints and muscles involved in the motion in question. Workers doing repetitive motions at a high pace of work with little recovery time and workers with little to no control over the timing of motions (e.g. workers on assembly lines) are also prone to MSDs due to the motion of their work. Force needed to perform actions on the job can also be associated with higher MSD risk in workers, because movements which require more force can fatigue muscles quicker which can lead to injury and/or pain. Additionally, exposure to vibration (as in truck drivers or construction workers, for example) and extreme hot or cold temperatures can affect a worker's ability to judge force and strength, which can lead to development of MSDs.

There are 2, 976 genes on the chip, and these genes were selected from a cDNA library prepared with human peripheral white blood cells (WBC). Different gene levels between the HAVS patients and controls, and between groups of HAVS with different levels of symptoms, were indicated by the randomized variance model. The most up-regulated genes were analyzed for their possible functions and association with the occurrence of HAVS.

Epidemiological methods were applied to investigate a possible association between occupational exposure to vibration and myocardial infarction. Two study populations were used; one case-control study (n= 475) and one cohort of iron-ore miners in Kiruna and Malmberget, Sweden (n= 13621). In the former, the cases were first-time myocardial infarction patients and the controls were selected to match for sex, age and hospital catchment area. Job-exposure matrixes for vibration were established for both the case-control study and the cohort study. In order to study acute effects on cardiac regulation, an experimental study was conducted on healthy subjects (n= 20) who were exposed to <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> exclusively and in combination with exposure to noise. The effect on the autonomic balance was measured by heart rate-variability. In the case-control study, an increased risk of contracting myocardial infarction was found among occupations entailing vibration exposure. The results from the cohort show an increased risk of myocardial infarction mortality compared to a reference population. The increment was higher for those younger than 60 years. Relative risks for myocardial infarction mortality increased with increasing exposure to vibration in the group at working-age and the increased risk remained after adjusting for exposure to dust. In the experimental study, exposure to <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> was found to acutely affect the autonomic nervous system as the total heart-rate variability decreased during exposure to <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration.</b> To conclude: work entailing exposure to vibration is a risk factor for myocardial infarction, increased myocardial infarction mortality attributed to exposure to vibration seems to be mainly observed at working-age, and exposure to <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> acutely decreases heart-rate variability and thus affects heart-rate regulation...|$|R

Hand-transmitted vibration (HTV) occurs when the vibration enters the body through the hands, e. g. in various work processes where rotating or percussive power tools or vibrating workpieces are held by the hands or fingers. Prolonged exposures to HTV from powered processes or tools are associated with an increased occurrence of symptoms and signs of disorders in the vascular, neurological and musculoskeletal systems of the upper limbs. The complex of these disorders is called <b>Hand-Arm</b> <b>Vibration</b> <b>Syndrome</b> (HAVS) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> <b>syndrome</b> (HAVS) is a {{collection}} of sensory, vascular, and musculoskeletal symptoms caused by repetitive trauma from vibration. This case report demonstrates how to diagnose HAVS on the basis of history, physical examination, and vascular imaging and its treatment options. A 41 -year-old man who regularly used vibrating tools presented with nonhealing wounds on his right thumb and third digit. Arteriography revealed occlusions of multiple arteries in his hand with formation of collaterals. We diagnosed HAVS, and his wounds healed after several weeks with appropriate treatment. HAVS is a debilitating condition with often irreversible vascular damage, requiring early diagnosis and treatment...|$|E
40|$|A dynamic economy {{contributes}} {{to the increase in}} the number of workers exposed to mechanical vibration caused by machines and transport equipment. As the means of transport are insufficiently recognised sources of mechanical vibrations, this ar-ticle presents the results of whole-body and <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> tests of 30 most common means of in-house transport. An analysis of vibration signals recorded at each workstation according to PN-EN 14253 and PN-EN ISO 5349 made it possible to determine the weighted values of components of directional vibration acceleration and the values of daily vibration exposure A(8). In order to assess exposure to whole-body and <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> at the tested workstations of in-house transport, indices of vibration hazard related to admissible values, the total evaluation index (developed in a previous study at CIOP-PIB) and a three-degrees scale for assessing exposure to vibrations were used. The assessment showed that the workstations were a major hazard. Vibration hazards at all those workstations were classified as either medium or high...|$|R
40|$|Long-lasting {{and intense}} {{vibration}} {{of the hand}} and the arm can cause serious diseases. The estimation of risks {{with respect to the}} hand and arm vibration can be achieved by the consideration of exposure duration and vibration intensity. Manual assessment of exposure durations and used tools is expensive, disturbs and the workflow or may be performed only sporadically and rarely due to high costs. Robust and cheap smart watches including a plurality of integrated sensors are available on the market. Although smart watches provide accurate acceleration, rotation rate, acoustic sensors and a powerful processing unit, it is so far unclear whether these systems can be used to assess <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> (HAV). In a feasibility study, it was evaluated if vibration pattern and sound features are suitable to identify the used tools under laboratory conditions and in field trials. As a result of the evaluation, the possibilities and constraints for an individual determination of <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> have been worked out...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNext {{to weight}} {{reduction}} and stiffness increase, increasing the cyclist's comfort {{has become an}} additional aspect in the design process of racing bicycles. Several {{attempts have been made}} to increase the shock absorption and damping capacity of a racing bicycle, but for the designer it is difficult to estimate the effect on the riding quality of the bicycle and whether the comfort perception of the cyclist increases. This work proposes an experimental test setup for quantifying comfort during outdoor field testing including real time data acquisition and storage from 16 sensors. This data is analysed by means of the whole-body and <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> method and the absorbed power method. The initial test results show that the absorbed power method seems to correlate best with the cyclist's comfort. This method does not take acceleration data into account (as in the whole-body and <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> method), but the combination of contact force and contact velocity is used for analysis...|$|R
