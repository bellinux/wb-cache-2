40|$|Proxy {{ratings of}} {{functional}} status {{were compared with}} subject self-reports in five domains relevant {{to the study of}} older persons and with observations of subject performance in two areas (physical and <b>instrumental</b> <b>functioning).</b> Data were derived from 233 proxy-subject pairs evaluated in a prospective study of hip fracture patients aged 65 years or more in Baltimore, Maryland (1990 - 1991). Agreement between proxy and subject reports was highest for a summary measure of <b>instrumental</b> <b>functioning</b> and lowest for a measure of depression. Proxies tended to report more disability than did subjects, although bias varied by function. Patterns of agreement for proxy reports versus observations of performance compared with patterns for proxy reports versus subject reports were lower for measures of <b>instrumental</b> <b>functioning,</b> and bias was generally more extreme for <b>instrumental</b> and physical <b>functioning</b> measures.

In Study 2, "die-hard" soccer fans (N = 1, 546) suggested soccer chants in reaction to either a group-reinforcing (own team scores) or group-threatening (other team scores) situation and rated the perceived functionality of the song. Although both of these conditions evoked discriminating songs, as predicted, these served a more identity-confirming function in the reinforcing situation but a more <b>instrumental</b> <b>function</b> (pepping up the team) in the threat situation.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of three deconvolution procedures is presented. The first technique {{is based on}} modified Stokes method. The second technique decomposes measured data into a Fourier series of harmonic functions. The third procedure regards the measured data as a linear combination of <b>instrumental</b> <b>functions.</b> It {{was found that the}} critical phenomenon influencing the quality of result is the amount of smoothing, which is contained in the respective deconvolution technique. Nevertheless, different deconvolution routines had different ranging depending on the criterion chosen. The modified Stokes method offers the shortest computing time, but it needs a higher amount of smoothing to remove noise from the experimental data. The decomposition of experimental data into a Fourier series is advantageous for use with noisy data but it is awkward for steep edges of the deconvoluted function. The linear combination of <b>instrumental</b> <b>functions</b> yields typically the best match between the experimental and the re-convoluted data, but it is time consuming. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} degree of {{separation}} or unity between the algebraic and geometric modes of thought of students in tertiary education. Case studies indicate that as a student is inducted into the use of algebra the insightful and visual components of geometrical and graphical modes of thought are sidelined. Based on Vygotsky’s taxonomy of the psychogenesis of cultural forms of behaviour, I suggest that this separation occurs because the algebraic methods remain fixed at a naïve or algorithmic stage. The algebraic concepts may fail to be internalised because the stage of <b>instrumental</b> <b>functioning</b> of algebra as a ‘tool’ or ‘method’ of geometry is not successfully transitioned.   I suggest that this stage of <b>instrumental</b> <b>functioning</b> may be stimulated by using dynamic geometry programs to promote the formation of images in conjunction with algebraic representations in problem solving.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Social {{functioning}} is impaired {{in approximately}} two-thirds of stroke patients of vocational age, even {{several months after}} a first ever mild to moderate stroke. The known predictors of social functioning are initial stroke severity, anxiety and depression, and the Mini-Mental State Evaluation, suggesting that cognitive deficits contribute to post-stroke social dysfunctioning. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate whether cognitive domains correlated with social functioning and to determine the cognitive predictors of social dysfunctioning. METHODS: 74 patients were prospectively included 6 months after a first ever stroke. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin scale, depression and anxiety were recorded. Social functioning was recorded using the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS). An extensive neuropsychological test battery explored general cognitive <b>functioning,</b> episodic memory, <b>instrumental</b> <b>functions,</b> executive functions and working memory. Univariate comparisons assessed the relationships between the neuropsychological tests and scores on the WSAS. Predicting factors for WSAS were determined using ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: 52 patients (70 %; 95 % confidence interval 58 % to 80 %) complained of significant perturbations in work and social functioning. In univariate comparisons, general cognitive <b>functioning,</b> memory, <b>instrumental</b> <b>functions,</b> executive functions and working memory significantly correlated with social functioning. Working memory was the most affected domain. With multivariate modelling, the NIHSS at admission, Hospital Anxiety Depression scale and Owen's Spatial Working Memory test were independent predictors of WSAS. CONCLUSIONS: All cognitive domains were associated with social functioning, working memory being the main cognitive determinant. Our results suggest that cognitive impairment impacts on social dysfunctioning, which is known to be a component of quality of life...|$|R
40|$|In two experiments, {{the authors}} {{examined}} {{the interplay of}} two functions of intergroup differentiation: an identity function (obtaining a distinct and meaningful social identity) and an <b>instrumental</b> <b>function</b> (advancing group goals).

Highest differentiation (and cohesion and identification) resulted in the minimal condition (no goal, no prior differentiation opportunity) and in the instrumental condition (goal and prior differentiation opportunity).

40|$|Few current {{studies of}} the effects of chronic {{conditions}} on social functioning examine the effects of disease on the role of homemaker. A major problem confronting researchers in this area is the difficulty in operationalizing dysfunction in social roles other than work roles. In this study we have developed a measure of homemaker functioning based on conceptualizing the homemaker role on two dimensions: the <b>instrumental</b> <b>functions</b> associated with meeting the physical needs of the household and the nurturant dimension concerned with meeting the expressive needs of the household. We used our measure of homemaker functioning to study the effects of rheumatoid arthritis on 142 women, whether employed outside the home or not, between the ages of 21 and 65, all living with husband and/or children at the time of disease onset. The disease significantly limited both <b>instrumental</b> and nurturing <b>functions</b> associated with managing a household. The more strenuous <b>instrumental</b> <b>functions</b> {{were more likely to be}} limited, although women in our study experienced serious limitations in nurturant role functions, as well. Limitations in functioning along the nurturant dimension were surprisingly high and previously undocumented. Comparisons between women employed outside the home and those not employed found few differences between the groups in social functioning on either dimension of the homemaker role. Employed women were somewhat less physically disabled than the unemployed, but both groups of homemakers continued to assume major responsibility for homemaking. Assessing functioning in social roles other than work, and functioning in nurturant as well as instrumental areas, is especially important in evaluating the effects on women of a chronic disease such as rheumatoid arthritis. rheumatoid arthritis homemaking women's social roles...|$|R
40|$|The {{psychological}} {{model of}} thinking about money assumes that implicit reminders of money lead to self-sufficient motivation. Previous {{research has demonstrated that}} children react to money in similar ways to adults. The priming of young children with money related concepts or images has negatively affected their social behaviour and social preferences, leading them to make more individualist and less pro-social choices and be less willing to help others. The aim of this research was to investigate the positive influence of money activation on children’s behaviour. The participants were six to eight year old children who do not yet fully understand the <b>instrumental</b> <b>function</b> of money due to their young age. Two experimental studies were performed, the first of which analysed the effect of perseverance and performance on a challenging task and the second investigated preferences with respect to delaying gratification. Sixty-one children aged 6 took part in the first study and forty-six scout camp participants 6 to 8 years of age were involved in the second experiment. The results support the hypotheses concerning the effects of money activation stating that (1) money activation influences children’s perseverance and effectiveness in difficult individual tasks, and that (2) it increases children’s preferences for delayed gratification. These results suggest that money has a symbolic power which may exert both positive and negative effects on children’s behaviour. Since {{children between the ages of}} 6 and 8 do not understand the <b>instrumental</b> <b>function</b> of money fully, certain symbolic meanings of money may have been responsible for the money priming effects. The findings suggest that the symbolic function of money is more primal than its <b>instrumental</b> <b>function</b> and that it probably develops at an earlier stage in life...|$|E
40|$|A Bayesian {{model of}} the {{emission}} spectrum of the JET lithium beam has been developed to infer {{the intensity of the}} Li I (2 p- 2 s) line radiation and associated uncertainties. The detected spectrum for each channel of the lithium beam emission spectroscopy (Li-BES) system is here modelled by a single Li line modified by an <b>instrumental</b> <b>function,</b> Bremsstrahlung background, instrumental offset, and interference filter curve. Both the <b>instrumental</b> <b>function</b> and the interference filter curve are modelled with non-parametric Gaussian processes. All free parameters of the model, the intensities of the Li line, Bremsstrahlung background, and instrumental offset, are inferred using Bayesian probability theory with a Gaussian likelihood for photon statistics and electronic background noise. The prior distributions of the free parameters are chosen as Gaussians. Given these assumptions, the intensity of the Li line and corresponding uncertainties are analytically available using a Bayesian linear inversion technique. The proposed approach makes it possible to extract the intensity of Li line without doing a separate background subtraction through modulation of the Li beam.

In graduate education, factors such as racism, prejudice, discrimination, sexism, stereotypes, tokenism, {{and a lack of}} role models can all plague students and contribute to uncompleted degrees and non-entrance into STEM fields. One of the tools being used to combat these barriers is effective mentoring. Graduate students and their advisors generally have close working relationships and advisors serve in a tremendously important {{role in the development of}} the graduate student, so an effective mentoring relationship is vital. ^ The purpose of this study was to explore and describe graduate student STEM majors 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of mentoring provided by their academic advisors in diversified and homogenous mentoring relationships. The Diversified Mentorship Theory was utilized as the theoretical framework, and existing measures were adapted and used to measure the variables of psychosocial mentoring <b>functions,</b> <b>instrumental</b> mentoring <b>functions,</b> and mentoring relationship quality. Using a mixed-methods study approach, graduate students in STEM fields at Purdue University (N= 1, 783) were surveyed regarding the mentoring relationship they have with their advisors. An emphasis was placed on factors of diversity, including the gender and racial makeup of the relationship, as well as the instrumental and psychosocial mentoring support provided and the overall quality of the mentoring relationship. ^ Findings revealed that participants considered their advisor to be a mentor to a moderate extent, and that advisors provided both psychosocial and instrumental mentoring support to a moderate extent. One-way between subjects ANOVA tests were conducted to compare the effect of gender and race on psychosocial <b>functions,</b> <b>instrumental</b> <b>functions,</b> and relationship quality. Gender had a statistically significant effect on psychosocial mentoring functions.
