5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster.</b> All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded {{do a better job}} of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that has proven to be a disaster for our nation be terminated, that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.|$|E

Spending $478.28 of that on purchasing the second-hand Bolex camera [...] "of [...] dreams", Lynch produced a new animated short, but upon getting the film developed, realized that the result was simply a blurred, frameless print.
