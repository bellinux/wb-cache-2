5|$|In 1529, Georgius Agricola {{described}} <b>fluorite</b> as an additive used {{to lower}} the melting point of metals during smelting. He penned the Latin word fluorés (fluor, flow) for <b>fluorite</b> rocks. The name later evolved into fluorspar (still commonly used) and then <b>fluorite.</b> The composition of <b>fluorite</b> was later determined to be calcium difluoride.|$|E
5|$|Divalent {{europium}} (Eu2+) {{in small}} amounts is the activator of the bright blue fluorescence of some samples of the mineral <b>fluorite</b> (CaF2). The reduction from Eu3+ to Eu2+ is induced by irradiation with energetic particles. The most outstanding examples of this originated around Weardale and adjacent parts of northern England; it was the <b>fluorite</b> found here that fluorescence was named after in 1852, {{although it was not}} until much later that europium was determined to be the cause.|$|E
5|$|In September 2008, it was {{reported}} that one of the few <b>fluorite</b> deposits in Europe located near Chiprovtsi would be developed by a Bulgarian company that had leased the mine for 20 years. The company has invested BGN 14.5 million and aims to extract 150,000 tonnes of raw material and produce 50,000 tonnes of pure <b>fluorite</b> a year. , the company employs 73 miners, all former workers in the closed local mines, and expects their number to reach 150.|$|E

40|$|International audienceNonlinear and spectroscopic {{properties}} of pure and Yb 3 + doped <b>fluorites</b> are reviewed. Pure <b>fluorites,</b> like BaF 2, appear as very valuable nonlinear materials {{for improving the}} contrast of high intensity and ultra-short laser pulses. Heavily Yb 3 + doped <b>fluorites,</b> like Yb 3 +:CaF 2, thanks to the unique luminescence properties, appear as very favourable amplifier media for the future high power laser chains...|$|R
5|$|Owing to {{the expense}} of {{refining}} pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined <b>fluorite</b> used in steelmaking. The rest of the <b>fluorite</b> is converted into corrosive hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into cryolite which {{plays a key role}} in aluminium refining. Organic fluorides have very high chemical and thermal stability; their major uses are as refrigerants, electrical insulation and cookware, the last as PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine also contain fluorine, and the fluoride ion inhibits dental cavities, and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation. Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US$15 billion a year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fluorite</b> mining, which {{supplies}} most global fluorine, {{peaked in}} 1989 when 5.6 {{million metric tons}} of ore were extracted. Chlorofluorocarbon restrictions lowered this to 3.6 million tons in 1994; production has since been increasing. Around 4.5 million tons of ore and revenue of US$550 million were generated in 2003; later reports estimated 2011 global fluorochemical sales at $15 billion and predicted 2016–18 production figures of 3.5 to 5.9 million tons, and revenue of at least $20 billion. Froth flotation separates mined <b>fluorite</b> into two main metallurgical grades of equal proportion: 60–85% pure metspar is almost all used in iron smelting whereas 97%+ pure acidspar is mainly converted to the key industrial intermediate hydrogen fluoride.|$|E
5|$|Limestone is {{the most}} {{important}} mineral quarried, mainly for roads and cement; shale is extracted for cement at Hope, and several gritstone quarries are worked for building stone. Lead mining is no longer economic, but <b>fluorite,</b> baryte and calcite are extracted from lead veins, and small-scale Blue John mining occurs at Castleton.|$|E

40|$|This study evaluates a-CI-Br {{systematic}} {{of fluid}} inclusions in <b>fluorites</b> from "Berbes-La Cabaña" and "La Collada" districts in Asturias (N of Spain). The <b>fluorites</b> were formed as H 20 -NaCI-Ca 2 CI fluids represented by primary inclusions (Lwl) showing moderate salinity (Tm:-l 2. 4 ° to - 6. 6 °C) and homogenization temperature between 130 ° to 150 °C. Lw 2 inclusions are secondary with low salinity (Tm:- 2. 9 to - 2. 7 °C) and global homogenization ranging between 130 ° to 135 °C. Hypersaline Lw-s inclusions have distinguished in La Collada district. The high salinity of these inclusions {{could be explained}} as resulting of reequilibration processes. Comparison ofNa-CI-Br compositions show fundamental differences in halogen chemistry between two regions. Crush-leach extraction ana chemical analysis of the inclusions from "Berbes-La Cabaña <b>fluorites</b> reveals that the fluid chemistry {{is influenced by the}} fluid-rock interaction with Na-Ca exchange. The low concentration of Br suggest a brine derived from halite dissolution by reaction with evaporites. In contrast, Cl/ Br and Na/Br decrease strongly In brines from "La Collada" <b>fluorites</b> and are similar to modern seawater. These halogen ratios are consistent with solutes derived from evaporation of seawater...|$|R
40|$|Pronounced diffuse phase {{transitions}} of Schottky type {{are found}} by cp measurement for <b>fluorites</b> PbF 2, SrCl 2 and BaF 2 at higher temperatures. Formation energies and entropies are calculated for isolated defects from the transition curves. From {{the energy and}} entropy of transition an upper and a lower limit can be derived for higher defect concentrations. It is seen that these concentrations scarcely exceed 10 % immediately below the melting point. BaCl 2 is distinguished among the other <b>fluorites</b> showing an absolutely sharp transition instead of a diffuse one at 1 195 K...|$|R
5|$|Two oxides of {{berkelium}} are known, with berkelium in the +3 (Bk2O3) and +4 (BkO2) oxidation states.

5|$|Deserted {{for about}} 30 years, {{the town was}} {{repopulated}} by Eastern Orthodox Bulgarians, beginning in the 1720s. It was following this new settlement that Chiprovtsi became a major centre of the Bulgarian carpet industry. Other traditional industries have been stock breeding, agriculture and fur trade. Today, Chiprovtsi municipality experiences a declining population and above-average unemployment. However, large-scale investment in the extraction of the local <b>fluorite</b> deposits {{and the development of}} alternative tourism help to sustain the economy.|$|E
40|$|Certain solids exhibit anomalously high ionic conductivities at {{temperatures}} appreciably below their melting points; {{this phenomenon is}} {{sometimes referred to as}} superionicity, and is associated with development of disorder in a component sublattice. This effect has been studied in the <b>fluorites</b> SrCl 2, BaF 2 and PbF 2 and in AgI, using Raman and Brillouin scattering. In the <b>fluorites</b> the disorder occurs in the anion sublattice and in AgI in the cation sublattice. At the transition to the highly conducting phase, the emergence of a broad low-frequency response has been observed; simultaneously, there is a dramatic softening of elastic constants...|$|R
25|$|In 1819, Edward D. Clarke and in 1822 René Just Haüy {{described}} fluorescence in <b>fluorites,</b> Sir David Brewster {{described the}} phenomenon for chlorophyll in 1833 and Sir John Herschel {{did the same}} for quinine in 1845.|$|R
50|$|The {{company began}} {{producing}} <b>fluorites</b> {{in the early}} 1970s and its Kimwarer mine has been in operation since. In 1996, businessman Charles Field-Marsham acquired Kenya Fluorspar {{as part of a}} government reform effort of corporate privatization.|$|R
5|$|<b>Fluorite</b> or {{fluorspar}} {{is called}} Blue John in the Peak District, the name allegedly {{coming from the}} French Bleu et Jaune which describes the colour of the bandings. Blue John is now scarce, {{and only a few}} hundred kilograms are mined each year for ornamental and lapidary use. The Blue John Cavern in Castleton is a show cave; mining still takes place in the nearby Treak Cliff Cavern.|$|E
5|$|Numerous mixed lead(II,IV) oxides are known. When PbO2 {{is heated}} in air, it becomes Pb12O19 at 293°C, Pb12O17 at 351°C, Pb3O4 at 374°C, and finally PbO at 605°C. A further {{sesquioxide}} Pb2O3 {{can be obtained}} at high pressure, along with several non-stoichiometric phases. Many of them show defective <b>fluorite</b> structures in which some oxygen atoms are replaced by vacancies: PbO {{can be considered as}} having such a structure, with every alternate layer of oxygen atoms absent.|$|E
5|$|Tessellation can be {{extended}} to three dimensions. Certain polyhedra can be stacked in a regular crystal pattern to fill (or tile) three-dimensional space, including the cube (the only Platonic polyhedron to do so), the rhombic dodecahedron, the truncated octahedron, and triangular, quadrilateral, and hexagonal prisms, among others. Any polyhedron that fits this criterion {{is known as a}} plesiohedron, and may possess between 4 and 38 faces. Naturally occurring rhombic dodecahedra are found as crystals of andradite (a kind of garnet) and <b>fluorite.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that the color of natural yellow <b>fluorites</b> is due to an O - 3 molecule ion incorporated into the lattice. The center has several equilibrium positions. A detailed EPR and ENDOR study of this center is presented and the motional effects observed in the EPR spectrum are analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Natural colored <b>fluorites</b> {{were studied}} {{by means of}} optical {{absorption}} and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Complex centers involving rare-earth ions and/or oxygen give rise to the various colors observed. These include yttrium-associated F centers (blue), coexisting yttrium and cerium-associated F centers (yellowish-green), the (YO 2) center (rose) and the O 3 – molecule ion (yellow). Divalent rare-earth ions {{also contribute to the}} colorations, as for instance Sm 3 + (green <b>fluorites),</b> or they are at the origin of strong fluorescence observed (Eu 2 +). Strong irradiation of the crystals with ionizing radiation leads to coagulation of color centers, and to precipitation of metallic calcium colloids. There is probably no simple relation connecting the coloration and the growth process of the crystal. Thermal stability studies, however, have allowed to partially classify the colors as being of primary or secondary origin...|$|R
40|$|International audienceVolatiles and {{especially}} halogens (F and Cl) {{have been recognized}} as important species in thegenesis and melting of planetary magmas. Data from the Chemical Camera instrument on board the MarsScience Laboratory rover Curiosity now provide the first in situ analyses of fluorine at the surface of Mars. Twoprincipal F-bearing mineral assemblages are identified. The first is associated with high aluminum and lowcalcium contents, in which the F-bearing phase is an aluminosilicate. It is found in conglomerates and mayindicate petrologically evolved sources. This {{is the first time}} that such a petrologic environment is found onMars. The second is represented by samples that have high calcium contents, in which the main F-bearingminerals are likely to be fluorapatites and/or <b>fluorites.</b> Fluorapatites are found in some sandstone and may bedetrital, while <b>fluorites</b> are also found in the conglomerates, possibly indicating low-T alteration processes...|$|R
5|$|Three {{americium}} oxides are known, {{with the}} oxidation states +2 (AmO), +3 (Am2O3) and +4 (AmO2). Americium(II) oxide was prepared in minute amounts {{and has not}} been characterized in details. Americium(III) oxide is a red-brown solid with a melting point of 2205°C. Americium(IV) oxide is the main form of solid americium which is used in nearly all its applications. As most other actinide dioxides, it is a black solid with a cubic (<b>fluorite)</b> crystal structure.|$|E
5|$|Calcium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. An alkaline earth metal, calcium is a reactive pale yellow metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer {{when exposed to}} air. Its {{physical and chemical properties}} are most similar to its heavier homologues strontium and barium. It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal, after iron and aluminium. The most common calcium compound on Earth is calcium carbonate, found in limestone and the fossilised remnants of early sea life; gypsum, anhydrite, <b>fluorite,</b> and apatite are also sources of calcium.|$|E
5|$|Organofluorides consume over 20% of mined <b>fluorite</b> {{and over}} 40% of {{hydrofluoric}} acid, with refrigerant gases dominating and fluoropolymers increasing their market share. Surfactants are a minor application but generate over $1 {{billion in annual}} revenue. Due to the danger from direct hydrocarbon–fluorine reactions above −150°C (−240°F), industrial fluorocarbon production is indirect, mostly through halogen exchange reactions such as Swarts fluorination, in which chlorocarbon chlorines are substituted for fluorines by hydrogen fluoride under catalysts. Electrochemical fluorination subjects hydrocarbons to electrolysis in hydrogen fluoride, and the Fowler process treats them with solid fluorine carriers like cobalt trifluoride.|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} using laser {{spectroscopy}} {{has been developed}} and applied {{to the study of}} defects in alkaline earth fluoride crystals. The concentrations of all the defects have been determined as a function of concentration and temperature.

Subirana gave a short lectures on the problems to obtain good results and new conclusions in their Institutes...|$|R
5|$|This may {{be reduced}} to cerium(III) oxide with {{hydrogen}} gas. Cerium metal is highly pyrophoric, meaning that when it is ground or scratched, the resulting shavings catch fire. This reactivity conforms to periodic trends, since cerium {{is one of the}} first and hence one of the largest lanthanides. Cerium(IV) oxide has the <b>fluorite</b> structure, similarly to the dioxides of praseodymium and terbium. Many nonstoichiometric chalcogenides are also known, along with the trivalent Ce2Z3 (Z = S, Se, Te). The monochalcogenides CeZ conduct electricity and would better be formulated as Ce3+Z2−e−. While CeZ2 are known, they are polychalcogenides with cerium(III): cerium(IV) chalcogenides remain unknown.|$|E
5|$|Lead mining {{peaked in}} the 17th and 18th centuries; high {{concentrations}} of lead {{have been found in}} the area dating back from this period, as well as discovering peat on Kinder Scout suggesting that lead smelting occurred. Lead mining began to decline from the mid-19th century, with the last major mine closing in 1939, though lead remains a by-product of <b>fluorite,</b> baryte and calcite mining. Not all mines were deep underground; Bell pits were a cheap and easy way at getting at an ore that lay close to the surface of flat land. A shaft was sunk into the ore and enlarged at the bottom for extraction. The pit was then enlarged further until it became unsafe or worked out, then another pit would be sunk adjacent to the existing one.|$|E
25|$|Some {{instances}} of ancient use of <b>fluorite,</b> main source mineral of fluorine, for ornamental use carvings exist. However, archeological finds are rare, perhaps {{in part because}} of the stone's softness.

40|$|Mixed-cation superionic <b>fluorites</b> are {{exceptionally}} good F- ion conductors due to {{the mixed}} nature of the cation sublattice. In this study, we have used extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy to gain insights into the local environments of the Cd and Pb cations (as a function of composition and temperature) in CdF 2 (xPbF(2)) mixed-cation superionic <b>fluorites.</b> A high degree of disorder is shown around both cations. However, the extent of disorder is even larger around the Pb 2 + in the entire series of solid solutions, with the highest disorder noted for the x = 60 mol% PbF 2 sample. The large values of the Debye-Waller factors of the Pb-F interactions {{are consistent with the}} low amplitudes of their Fourier transforms. This can be correlated with relative ionic conductivities of each composition in these materials. Molecular dynamics (MD) {{has been used as a}} complementary technique on structural properties; systems were modelled at temperatures ranging from liquid nitrogen temperature, 77 K, to 300 K. Our MD results confirm that disorder is greatest at concentrations x approximate to 60 mol% PbF 2...|$|R
