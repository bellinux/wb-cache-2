50|$|As a Head of the State Agency of Fisheries of Ukraine he {{has carried}} out {{reforms of the}} fishing industry. In 2015 he began the {{large-scale}} deregulation: cancellation of 7 permitting documents, which created the basis for corruption; development of the aquaculture and mariculture; prohibition of the industrial fishing in the Dniper river in Kiev. Yarema Kovaliv has started the reformation of the fish protection authorities, whose quality of work {{was the reason for}} distrust of the society.

5000|$|On 5 December 2013, the South African Public Protector {{released}} its report on accusations that {{the contract to}} manage South Africa's fleet of <b>fishing</b> <b>patrol</b> vessels was improperly handled and awarded to Sekunjalo's Marine Service Consortium. The report found that the awarding of the R800 million a year contract was improper and did not comply {{with the department of}} Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries supply-chain management requirements. [...] The Public Protector found that the head of the department's tender evaluation had been “irrational, biased and improper” in its awarding of the bid to Sekunjalo. [...] In the final report Sekunjalo was largely cleared of charges of collusion and corruption with the Public Protector deciding to refer the matter to the South African Competition Commission for further investigation.|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps {{our most}} laughable exploit on the <b>fish</b> <b>patrol,</b> {{and at the}} same time our most {{dangerous}} one, was when we rounded in, at a single haul, an even score of wrathful fishermen. Charley called it a [...] "coop," [...] having heard Neil Partington use the term; but I think he misunderstood the word, and thought it meant [...] "coop," [...] to catch, to trap. The fishermen, however, coup or coop, must have called it a Waterloo, for it was the severest stroke ever dealt them by the <b>fish</b> <b>patrol,</b> while they had invited it by open and impudent defiance of the law.|$|R
60|$|And then, in triumph, {{with no more}} veering and yawing, we sailed into Benicia, the King of the Greeks bound {{hard and}} fast in the cockpit, {{and for the first}} time in his life a {{prisoner}} of the <b>fish</b> <b>patrol.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay tank you <b>fish</b> <b>patrol</b> fallers never ban {{so lucky}} {{as when you}} sail with Ole Ericsen," [...] he was saying, when a rifle cracked sharply astern, and a bullet gouged along the newly painted cabin, glanced on a nail, and sang shrilly onward into space.|$|R
50|$|Pauline {{was built}} as a {{civilian}} motorboat {{of the same name}} by the Everett Shaw Company at Cutler, Maine. On 28 June 1917, the U.S. Navy acquired her from her owner, the Maine <b>Fish</b> <b>Patrol,</b> for use as a section patrol boat during World War I. She was commissioned as USS Pauline (SP-658) on 2 July 1917.|$|R
60|$|Possibly {{our most}} {{exasperating}} {{experience on the}} <b>fish</b> <b>patrol</b> was when Charley Le Grant and I laid a two weeks' siege to a big four- masted English ship. Before we had finished with the affair, it became a pretty mathematical problem, and it was by the merest chance that we came into possession of the instrument that brought it to a successful termination.|$|R
60|$|By now {{the last}} of the fog had vanished, and Charley's {{estimate}} of our position was confirmed by the sight of McNear's Landing a short half-mile away, following: along the west shore, we rounded Point Pedro in plain view of the Chinese shrimp villages, and a great to-do was raised when they saw one of their junks towing behind the familiar <b>fish</b> <b>patrol</b> sloop.|$|R
25|$|The species inhabits inshore {{coastal waters}} rarely venturing offshore, and is pelagic, inhabiting both {{the upper and}} lower {{sections}} of the water column. Longfin trevally are commonly found on rocky and coral coastlines, often inhabiting reef complexes, with solitary individuals or groups of larger <b>fish</b> <b>patrolling</b> the edges of reefs. They are also found in shallow, sandy bays and lagoons, with juveniles known to enter and use estuaries as nursery areas.|$|R
60|$|Big Alec {{had never}} been {{captured}} by the <b>fish</b> <b>patrol.</b> It was his boast that no man could take him alive, {{and it was his}} history that of the many men who had tried to take him dead none had succeeded. It was also history that at least two patrolmen who had tried to take him dead had died themselves. Further, no man violated the fish laws more systematically and deliberately than Big Alec.|$|R
60|$|The {{spirit of}} the Chinese was broken, and so docile did they become that ere we made San Rafael they were out with the tow-rope, Yellow Handkerchief {{at the head of}} the line. As for George, it was his last trip with the <b>fish</b> <b>patrol.</b> He did not care for that sort of thing, he explained, and he thought a clerkship ashore was good enough for him. And we thought so too.|$|R
25|$|In 1889, London {{began working}} 12 to 18hours {{a day at}} Hickmott's Cannery. Seeking a way out, he {{borrowed}} money from his foster mother Virginia Prentiss, bought the sloop Razzle-Dazzle from an oyster pirate named French Frank, and became an oyster pirate. In his memoir, John Barleycorn, he claims also to have stolen French Frank's mistress Mamie. After a few months, his sloop became damaged beyond repair. London hired on {{as a member of}} the California <b>Fish</b> <b>Patrol.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{must not}} be thought, from what I have told of the Greek fishermen, that they were {{altogether}} bad. Far from it. But they were rough men, gathered together in isolated communities and fighting with the elements for a livelihood. They lived {{far away from the}} law and its workings, did not understand it, and thought it tyranny. Especially did the fish laws seem tyrannical. And because of this, they looked upon the men of the <b>fish</b> <b>patrol</b> as their natural enemies.|$|R
60|$|I {{laughed at}} Charley's fears while I {{gave in to}} the claims of his affection, and agreed to {{consider}} the last raid already performed. We had been together for two years, and now I was leaving the <b>fish</b> <b>patrol</b> {{in order to go}} back and finish my education. I had earned and saved money to put me through three years at the high school, and though the beginning of the term was several months away, I intended doing a lot of studying for the entrance examinations.|$|R
60|$|The consternation we {{spread among}} the {{fishermen}} was tremendous. As {{fast as we}} hooked a net the two ends of it, buoy and boat, came together as they dragged out astern; and so many buoys and boats, coming together at such breakneck speed, kept the fishermen on the jump to avoid smashing into one another. Also, they shouted at us like mad to heave to into the wind, for they took it as some drunken prank {{on the part of}} scow-sailors, little dreaming that we were the <b>fish</b> <b>patrol.</b>|$|R
60|$|And {{more than}} that, {{the next day}} on the fishing wharf, where we were {{inspecting}} nets, he saw fit to laugh and sneer at us, and this before all the fishermen. Charley's face went black with anger; but beyond promising Big Alec {{that in the end}} he would surely land him behind the bars, he controlled himself and said nothing. The King of the Greeks made his boast that no <b>fish</b> <b>patrol</b> had ever taken him or ever could take him, and the fishermen cheered him and said it was true. They grew excited, and it looked like trouble for a while; but Big Alec asserted his kingship and quelled them.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} I {{may as well}} explain that we of the <b>fish</b> <b>patrol</b> were free lances in a way. While Neil Partington, who was a patrolman proper, {{received}} a regular salary, Charley and I, being merely deputies, received only what we earned--that is to say, {{a certain percentage of}} the fines imposed on convicted violators of the fish laws. Also, any rewards that chanced our way were ours. We offered to share with Partington whatever we should get from Mr. Taft, but the patrolman would not hear of it. He was only too happy, he said, to do a good turn for us, who had done so many for him.|$|R
60|$|When Demetrios {{saw only}} {{one person in the}} <b>fish</b> <b>patrol</b> boat, and that one a boy, he {{proceeded}} to play with me. Making a short tack out, with me not thirty feet behind, he returned, with his sheet a little free, to Steamboat Wharf. And there he made short tacks, and turned and twisted and ducked around, to the great delight of his sympathetic audience. I was right behind him all the time, and I dared to do whatever he did, even when he squared away before the wind and jibed his big sail over--a most dangerous trick with such a sail in such a wind.|$|R
60|$|In the old days, the <b>fish</b> <b>patrol</b> had {{attempted}} his capture many disastrous times and had finally given it over, {{so that when}} the word was out that he was coming to Benicia, I was most anxious to see him. But I did not have to hunt him up. In his usual bold way, {{the first thing he did}} on arriving was to hunt us up. Charley Le Grant and I at the time were under a patrol-man named Carmintel, and the three of us were on the Reindeer, preparing for a trip, when Big Alec stepped aboard. Carmintel evidently knew him, for they shook hands in recognition. Big Alec took no notice of Charley or me.|$|R
60|$|San Francisco Bay is {{so large}} that often its storms are more {{disastrous}} to ocean-going craft than is the ocean itself in its violent moments. The waters of the bay contain all manner of fish, wherefore its surface is ploughed by the keels of all manner of fishing boats manned by all manner of fishermen. To protect the fish from this motley floating population many wise laws have been passed, {{and there is a}} <b>fish</b> <b>patrol</b> to see that these laws are enforced. Exciting times are the lot of the fish patrol: in its history more than one dead patrolman has marked defeat, and more often dead fishermen across their illegal nets have marked success.|$|R
60|$|Which points my moral. A man can sail in the forecastles of big ships all {{his life}} and never know what real sailing is. From the time I was twelve, I listened to {{the lure of the}} sea. When I was fifteen I was captain and owner of an oyster-pirate sloop. By the time I was sixteen I was sailing in scow-schooners, fishing salmon with the Greeks up the Sacramento River, and serving as sailor on the <b>Fish</b> <b>Patrol.</b> And I was a good sailor, too, though all my {{cruising}} had been on San Francisco Bay and the rivers tributary to it. I had never been on the ocean in my life.|$|R

5000|$|After five grueling patrols Lieutenant Commander Donaho turned command over to Captain Frank T. Watkins. On her sixth patrol (2 June - 27 July), Flying <b>Fish</b> <b>patrolled</b> in the Volcano Islands and off Taiwan. Her first attacks, two {{against the}} same convoy, {{resulted}} in unconfirmed damage, but off Taiwan on 2 July, she blasted the stern {{off of the}} merchant passenger/troop transport Canton Maru (2822 tons) watching it sink. While Pearl Harbor-bound from her patrol area, she made a two-day chase for a fast convoy, but was forced by her dwindling fuel supply to break off the hunt. On 11 July she destroyed the [...] sailing vessel Japanese guard boat Takatori Maru No.8 (51 tons) with gunfire, leaving it aflame from stem to stern.|$|R
5000|$|Jack London {{was born}} in San Francisco in 1876 and wrote about the Bay Area {{repeatedly}} throughout his career. Those stories have never been previously collected in a single Bay Area-themed volume. As the back cover {{copy of the book}} states, [...] "Although famous for his stories of the Klondike and the Pacific, London wrote extensively about his home base. This collection contains such classic stories as 'The Apostate' and 'South of the Slot' as well as extracts from John Barleycorn and The Sea-Wolf. The overlooked 1905 story cycle Tales of the <b>Fish</b> <b>Patrol</b> is included in its entirety. London's vivid eyewitness report of the Great 1906 Earthquake and Fire - which destroyed forever the old city - stands as a fitting epilogue." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{then began}} {{the siege of}} the Lancashire Queen, a siege memorable {{in the annals of}} both {{fishermen}} and <b>fish</b> <b>patrol.</b> When the Reindeer came along, after a fruitless pursuit of the shad fleet, Charley instructed Neil Partington to send out his own salmon boat, with blankets, provisions, and a fisherman's charcoal stove. By sunset this exchange of boats was made, and we said good-by to our Greek, who perforce had to go into Benicia and be locked up for his own violation of the law. After supper, Charley and I kept alternate four-hour watches till day-light. The fishermen made no attempt to escape that night, though the ship sent out a boat for scouting purposes to find if the coast were clear.|$|R
50|$|Brillant also {{improved}} the conversion time of reserve <b>fishing</b> boats to <b>patrol</b> boats from 3 days into few hours.|$|R
60|$|Time flies. It seems but {{yesterday}} that I was a lad of sixteen on the <b>fish</b> <b>patrol.</b> Yet I know that I arrived this very morning from China, {{with a quick}} passage to my credit, and master of the barkentine Harvester. And I know that to-morrow morning I shall run over to Oakland to see Neil Partington {{and his wife and}} family, and later on up to Benicia to see Charley Le Grant and talk over old times. No; I shall not go to Benicia, now that I think about it. I expect to be a highly interested party to a wedding, shortly to take place. Her name is Alice Partington, and, since Charley has promised to be best man, he will have to come down to Oakland instead.|$|R
60|$|We menaced their lives, {{or their}} living, {{which is the}} same thing, in many ways. We confiscated illegal traps and nets, the {{materials}} of which had cost them considerable sums and the making of which required weeks of labor. We prevented them from catching fish at many times and seasons, which was equivalent to preventing them from making as good a living as they might have made had we not been in existence. And when we captured them, they were brought into the courts of law, where heavy cash fines were collected from them. As a result, they hated us vindictively. As the dog is the natural enemy of the cat, the snake of man, so were we of the <b>fish</b> <b>patrol</b> the natural enemies of the fishermen.|$|R
5000|$|Located {{alongside}} the Bruce Highway, facilities in Rollingstone include a state primary school, a service station, general store, hotel and caravan park. [...] Rollingstone {{is a popular}} location for recreational activities such as camping, picnicing and swimming, {{and it is in}} close proximity to Balgal Beach, popular for its <b>fishing</b> and <b>patrolled</b> beachside swimming area.|$|R
60|$|Wildest {{among the}} fisher-folk may be {{accounted}} the Chinese shrimp- catchers. It is {{the habit of}} the shrimp to crawl along the bottom in vast armies till it reaches fresh water, when it turns about and crawls back again to the salt. And where the tide ebbs and flows, the Chinese sink great bag-nets to the bottom, with gaping mouths, into which the shrimp crawls and from which it is transferred to the boiling-pot. This in itself would not be bad, {{were it not for}} the small mesh of the nets, so small that the tiniest fishes, little new-hatched things not a quarter of an inch long, cannot pass through. The beautiful beaches of Points Pedro and Pablo, where are the shrimp-catchers' villages, are made fearful by the stench from myriads of decaying fish, and against this wasteful destruction it has ever been the duty of the <b>fish</b> <b>patrol</b> to act.|$|R
