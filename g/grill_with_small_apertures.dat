40|$|Abstract — The {{dependence}} of the transient response of a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) on its aperture size is investigated subject to direct current modulation and external optical feedback. It is shown that lasers <b>with</b> <b>small</b> <b>aperture</b> size suppress higher order bifurcations and chaos even under large-signal modulation and external optical feedback. Furthermore, the noise characteristics of VCSEL’s under the in-fluence of external optical feedback are studied via the calculation of relative intensity noise. It is found {{that the level of}} external optical feedback for the onset of coherence collapse is high for devices <b>with</b> <b>small</b> <b>aperture</b> size. On the other hand, the small-signal response of lasers is also analyzed through the calculation of third-order harmonic distortion. It is shown that harmonic distortion is minimized in small devices. Therefore, VCSEL’s <b>with</b> <b>small</b> <b>aperture</b> size have better immunity to irregular response under direct current modulation and external optical feedback.

40|$|The {{receiver}} hydrophone array is {{the signal}} front-end and {{plays an important}} role in matched field processing, which usually covers the whole water column from the sea surface to the bottom. Such a large aperture array is very difficult to realize. To solve this problem, an approach called matched field processing based on least squares <b>with</b> a <b>small</b> <b>aperture</b> hydrophone array is proposed, which decomposes the received acoustic fields into depth function matrix and amplitudes of the normal modes at the beginning. Then all the mode amplitudes are estimated using the least squares in the sense of minimum norm, and the amplitudes estimated are used to recalculate the received acoustic fields of the <b>small</b> <b>aperture</b> array, which means the recalculated ones contain more environmental information. In the end, lots of numerical experiments <b>with</b> three <b>small</b> <b>aperture</b> arrays are processed in the classical shallow water, and the performance of matched field passive localization is evaluated. The results show that the proposed method can make the recalculated fields contain more acoustic information of the source, and the performance of matched field passive localization <b>with</b> <b>small</b> <b>aperture</b> array is improved, so the proposed algorithm is proved to be effective...|$|R

50|$|This {{technique}} {{is based on}} the principle of Scheimpflug which, traditionally, is combined <b>with</b> <b>small</b> <b>aperture</b> to increase the gamut of focus beyond that achievable by depth of field alone. Usually no out-of-focus artifacts are desired in the image resulting from Scheimpflug adjustments. Here the converse is true. With the lens at full aperture, the photographer selects points in depth in the scene on which to focus and throws other points out-of-focus. This increases the contrast between the sharp and blurred areas and the selected application of focus and blur remains apparent to the viewer.|$|R
