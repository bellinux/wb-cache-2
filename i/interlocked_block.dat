The addition of many alternative materials into <b>interlocking</b> <b>block</b> {{in order to improve}} compressive strength has been reported. However, there is currently no report on the influence of application of biocalcification or microbiologically induced calcite precipitation (MICP) on <b>interlocking</b> <b>block</b> compressive strength. Objectives. This study aimed to investigate the effect of biocalcification on compressive strength of soil-cement <b>interlocking</b> <b>block.</b> Method. Soil bacterium, Bacillus pasteurii KCTC 3558, and Effective Microorganisms (EM) were added into <b>interlocking</b> <b>block</b> before molding as the replacement of mixing water. The change of compressive strength in <b>interlocking</b> <b>block</b> at 3, 7, 14 and 28 days of incubation was determined. Results. At 28 days, the compressive strength of <b>interlocking</b> <b>block</b> supplemented with B. pasteurii KCTC 3558 and 5 % EM were 7. 38 % and 9. 79 % significantly higher than control. Calcium carbonate crystals were also observed under scanning electron microscope which suggested that an increased compressive strength of <b>interlocking</b> <b>block</b> was caused by biocalcification.

40|$|Predicted mean {{sea level}} rise and {{increase}} of storm surge frequency and magnitude due to climate change require a strengthening of coastal protection. Therefore, a revetment system is needed that is characterized by both high resistance against external loading and low material costs. <b>Interlocking</b> <b>block</b> revetments, which form a subgroup of block revetments, represent one possible solution. The single <b>blocks</b> are <b>interlocked</b> for example by a horizontal or a vertical connection. Higher strength against external loading compared to loose block revetments can be expected. Although <b>interlocking</b> revetment <b>blocks</b> are successfully in use at slopes exposed to waves and currents since decades, there are no studies available neither in the national nor in the international literature, which evaluate the strength of <b>interlocking</b> <b>block</b> revetments. The objective {{of this study is}} the development of a design approach for <b>interlocking</b> <b>block</b> revetments against hydrodynamic loading and the evaluation of the stability increase due to the interlocking. In order to achieve these objectives, the equation for the limit state for the uplift loading due to wave attack, which represents the main failure mechanism of <b>interlocking</b> <b>block</b> revetments, has to be determined. Within the equation the resistance of the <b>interlocking</b> <b>block</b> and the stress due to the wave attack has to be compared. The determination of the resistance is based on pull out tests, performed under laboratory conditions and on pull out tests conducted on a wave loaded revetment within large scale model tests performed at the Large Wave Channel Hannover (GWK). These tests show that an additional interlocking force due to particles occurs. These particles are washed in the gaps between the inter-locking blocks due to the waves and the following dewatering processes. The determination of the loading due to wave attack is based on data from large scale model tests performed at the GWK. The analysis of the data reveals a relationship between the parameters of the incoming wave and the caused uplift load. In the following these results are combined to a design approach. It supports the design of <b>interlocking</b> <b>block</b> revetments depending on a predefined design wave.
