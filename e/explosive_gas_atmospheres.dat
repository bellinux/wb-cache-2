Leakage {{is one of}} big {{security}} {{risks in}} the <b>explosive</b> <b>gas</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> In view of the weak current and detection difficulty of leakage signal, a novel method of leakage detection is proposed. According to leakage transient characteristics, this method takes zero-sequence voltage as the fault threshold value triggering measurement device. Auto-correlation function is used to analyze leakage signal energy and cross-correlation function is used to calculated leakage signal phase relationship {{in order to identify}} leakage line further. Theoretical analysis and simulation show that the proposed method can greatly improve the sensitivity of weak leakage signal detection...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{regards the}} {{validation}} procedure of the Italian Guide CEI 31 - 35 formula, {{used to calculate}} the hazardous areas extensions in places where <b>explosive</b> <b>gas</b> <b>atmospheres</b> may be present. In industrial activity, a typical event which cause explosive atmosphere consists of damaging and leakage from unions, gaskets, valves of pipes and vessels. At this purpose, in this work it has been taken into account the accidental discharge of flammable gas into a quiescent atmosphere through an orifice. Validation has been performed by comparing calculated values with experimental data. Two gases have been taken into account: methane and hydrogen. Different scenarios have been analyzed, each one differing from the others in the gas release cross section and in the vessel pressure. Results show that the formula fits well not catastrophic industrial accident situation...|$|E
40|$|Fiber optic {{systems are}} being {{deployed}} in locations where <b>explosive</b> <b>gas</b> <b>atmospheres</b> are normally present or are present under fault conditions. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (NIOSH, PRL) {{conducted a study}} of laser safety in potentially flammable environments. Researchers conducted experiments to estimate the {{mean and standard deviation}} of laser powers needed to ignite 6 % methane-air atmospheres using single mode optical fiber tips covered by two types of iron oxide (Fe 304 and (FeMn) 203) mixed with a ceramic adhesive. The iron oxides, heated by a 1064 nm continuous wave laser, ignited the methane-air mixtures,at similar powers. The minimum igniting power and maximum non-igniting power (10 tests) were 407 and 350 mW, respectively, using a 62. 5 pm fiber. Laser beams guided by 125 and 80 pm diameter cladding single mode fibers produced similar methane-air igniting powers. Ignition was not observed using coal particles at powers that produced ignition with the iron oxides. Threshold ignition delays using the single mode fiber were approxinlately proportional to the inverse square of the igniting power. Ignition delays were significantly longer than the reported activation time for a comnlercial fiber optic power limiter. Comparisons are made with the results of other researchers.

40|$|International audienceTo {{apply the}} {{directive}} 1999 / 92 /EC, the employer shall {{ensure that the}} work equipment, used in place where explosive atmosphere may occur, are maintained so as to reduce at most explosion risks. The maintenance shall be realized in a permanent concern for keeping the protection level of work equipment in ATEX. This level shall never be either modified or deteriorated. That's why this activity shall be carried out only by workers who {{have been trained to}} the specificity of the protection types and shall be the matter of specific follow-up and management. The safety shall also be guaranteed if the maintenance and overhaul of equipment are sub-contracted. We will establish technical and organizational recommendations to ensure a safe maintenance of ATEX equipment.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a tracked robot with two articulated tracked arms for <b>explosive</b> or toxic <b>gases</b> detecting under coal mine. The ground under coal mine is seriously uneven. There are rails, crossties, ditches and some electrical apparatuses arranged {{in the coal}} mine tunnels. And sometimes the tunnels are with large slopes. The two articulated tracked arms can help the robot to surmount more obstacles and improve the adaptivity to uneven ground under coal mine. Since the coal mine is the highest degree <b>explosive</b> <b>gases</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> the coal mine detection robot itself {{can not be the}} source of explosion and must meet the mine-permissible requirements. Explosion-proof is essentially. In order to decrease the weight of the coal mine detection robot as possible, pressurized enclosure explosion-proof type is adopted for it. The components and workflow of the explosion-proof system of the robot are described in detail in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Intrinsic safety (IS) is a {{signaling}} {{technique that}} protects plant and personnel from {{the risk of}} fire and explosions by ensuring that the energy transferred to a hazardous area is well below the energy required to ignite the <b>explosive</b> <b>gas</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> IS basic principles are presented in this paper.

40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to review various methods of {{determining}} the extent of hazardous areas in industrial facilities where <b>explosive</b> <b>gas</b> or vapor <b>atmospheres</b> may be present. Three different approaches are analyzed and compared. The first one is recommended in North American Standards, such as API 500, API 505 and NFPA 497. The second is one of the proposals for the second edition of the International Standard IEC 60079 - 10 - 1 (adopted as European standard EN 60079 - 10 - 1). The third approach had been previously worked out with the authors‘ contribution and had been adopted by the Italian Guide CEI 31 - 35 since 2001. The last two approaches are analytical, meanwhile the first one is prescriptive. In the second part of the paper both analytical approaches are applied to the releases which are analyzed in NFPA 497 as practical examples. Resulting hazardous area extents are compared and the differences among the three methods are discusse...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{method for}} {{determination}} of hazardous zones for hydrogen installations has been studied. This {{work has been}} carried out within the NoE HySafe. The method is based on the Italian Method outlined in Guide 31 - 30 (2004), Guide 31 - 35 (2001), Guide 31 - 35 /A(2001), and Guide 31 - 35 /A; V 1 (2003). Hazardous zones for a "generic hydrogen refuelling station"(HRS) are assessed, based on this method. The method is consistent with the EU directive 1999 / 92 /EC "Safety and Health Protection of Workers potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres" which is the basis for determination of hazardous zones in Europe. This regulation is focused on protection of workers, and is relevant for hydrogen installations, such as hydrogen refuelling stations, repair shops and other stationary installations where some type of work operations will be involved. The method is also based on the IEC standard and European norm IEC/EN 60079 - 10 "Electrical apparatus for <b>explosive</b> <b>gas</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> Part 10 Classification of hazardous areas". This is a widely acknowledged international standard/norm and it is accepted/approved by Fire and Safety Authorities in Europe and also internationally. Results from the HySafe work and other studies relevant for hydrogen and hydrogen installations have been included in the case study. Sensitivity studies have been carried out to examine the effect of varying equipment failure frequencies and leak sizes, as well as environmental condition (ventilation, obstacles, etc.). The discharge and gas dispersion calculations in the Italian Method are based on simple mathematical formulas. However, in this work also CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) and other simpler numerical tools have been used to quantitatively estimate the effect of ventilation and of different release locations {{on the size of the}} flammable gas cloud. Concentration limits for hydrogen to be used as basis for the extent of the hazardous zones in different situations are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{apparatuses}} {{for use in}} potentially <b>explosive</b> <b>gas</b> <b>atmospheres</b> {{are required}} to be enclosed. There are two main requirements {{in the design of}} such enclosures. Firstly, they are required to withstand the pressure generated in an internal explosion. Secondly, any gap openings must be small enough to quench flames and to cool combustion products to prevent re-ignition of a surrounding explosive gas atmosphere. The largest gap opening that just prevents transmission of an internal explosion to a surrounding explosive gas atmosphere is called the maximum experimental safe gap (MESG). The MESG values is determined from standardised experiments. The purpose of the conducted experimental work was to investigate the influence of the gap material on the MESG value. Another aim was to find out if partial inertisation of the explosive gas influences the maximum experimental safe gap. The combustible gas used in the experiments was propane. The experiments were conducted in an apparatus with an interchangeable and adjustable gap opening. The gap materials tested was carbon steel, brass, aluminium and polyoxymethylene. The experiments with metal gaps show that the properties of the metals do not have a significant influence on the MESG value. However, a decrease of 0. 01 mm was achieved when a flame gap of brass was used, compared to the value obtained using a steel gap. Temperature measured above the orifice of the gap opening supports the finding. At equal gap opening, a higher temperature was measures above brass gaps than above steel gaps. An increase of the MESG was achieved by partial inertisation of the explosive gas atmosphere. The MESG value of propane was doubled when the oxygen content of air was lowered to 15. 04 volume percent...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{apparatuses}} {{for use in}} {{the presence}} of <b>explosive</b> <b>gas</b> <b>atmospheres</b> have to be specially designed to prevent them from igniting the explosive gas. Flameproof design implies that electrical components producing incendiary electrical sparks, e. g. relays and switches, be contained in enclosures that not only withstand the maximum pressure of an internal gas explosion. In addition any holes or slits in the enclosure wall have to be designed {{in such a way that}} they will not transmit a gas explosion inside the enclosure to an explosive gas atmosphere outside it. Designs of a variety of flameproof enclosure joints, including plane flanged joints, are specified in detail in international standards (IEC) requiring that the maximum permissible average roughness of any flame gap surface has to be < 6. 3 μm. The standards also require that any damaged joint surface has to be restored to the original quality prescribed in standards (IEC). However, the standards do not provide any guidance as to what level of damage is considered significant. As a result even minor mechanical or corrosive damage of flame path surfaces gives rise to expensive overhaul and repair of flame proof apparatuses. In fact, this is mandatory in spite of the fact that a generous safety factor is included in the requirements to maximum permissible gap widths. For example, for the plane-flange configuration and explosive gas (propane) used in the present investigation, the maximum permissible width in a practical apparatus is only 0. 4 mm, whereas the real limiting value is 0. 92 mm. The purpose of the present investigation has been to obtain some experimental guidance as to what level of damage of flame gap surfaces is required to significantly reduce the flame-proofing effect of flame gaps in flameproof electrical apparatuses. The maximum experimental safe gap (MESG) of an explosive gas mixture is the largest gap width between the two parts of a circular plane joint of 25 mm breadth in a standardized test, which prevents transmission of a gas explosion on the inside of the gap to an outside explosive gas mixtures. Normally the purpose of MESG experiments is to compare MESGs of different gases and vapours, using the same smooth flame gap surface in all experiments. However, in the present investigation MESG has been used as a parameter for judging whether various kinds of significant damage of the gap surface had any noticeable effect on the ability of the flame gap to prevent flame transmission. A significant reduction of MESG compared with that obtained with a standard undamaged surface (standard roughness of < 6. 3 μm) would mean that the particular type of damage under test had destroyed the gap efficiency significantly. On the other hand a significant increase of MESG compared with that for the undamaged surface would mean the damage had in fact significantly increased the gap efficiency. In the experiments performed in the present work premixed 4. 2 vol. % propane in air was used as the test gas mixture in all the experiments. Two different apparatuses were used, viz. a plane circular-flange apparatus (PCFA) and a plane rectangular-slit apparatus (PRSA). For both apparatuses the optimal distance between the ignition point and the gap entrance for flame transmission was 14 mm. Consequently this distance was used in all the experiments. The flame gap surfaces were damaged mechanically by [...] ...|$|E
