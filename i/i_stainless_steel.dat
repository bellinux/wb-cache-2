40|$|Healthcare {{acquired}} infections (HAI) pose a great {{threat in}} hospital settings and environmental contamination {{can be attributed}} to the spread of these. De-contamination and, significantly, prevention of re-contamination of the environment could help in preventing/reducing this threat. Goldshield (GS 5) is a novel organosilane biocide marketed as a single application product with residual biocidal activity. We tested the hypothesis that GS 5 could provide longer-term residual antimicrobial activity than existing disinfectants once applied to surfaces. Thus, the residual bactericidal properties of GS 5, Actichlor and Distel against repeated challenge with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300 were tested, and showed that GS 5 alone exhibited longer-term bactericidal activity for up to 6 days on 316 <b>I</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> surfaces. Having established efficacy against S. aureus, we tested GS 5 against common healthcare acquired pathogens, and demonstrated that, on average, a 1 log 10 bactericidal effect was exhibited by GS 5 treated surfaces, although biocidal activity varied depending upon the surface type and the species of bacteria. The ability of GS 5 to prevent Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation was measured in standard microtitre plate assays, where it had no significant effect on either biofilm formation or development. Taken together the data suggests that GS 5 treatment of surfaces may be a useful means to reducing bacterial contamination in the context of infection control practices...|$|E

Following each run, the fuel basket was sectioned and the fuel was removed. Samples of the fuel were analyzed for the extent of uranium oxide reduction to metal and for the concentration of salt constituents, i. e., LiCl and Li 2 O. Extents of uranium oxide reduction ranged from 43 – 70 % in <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> wire mesh baskets and 8 – 33 % in sintered <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> baskets.

40|$|<b>Stainless</b> <b>steel</b> {{is widely}} used in {{seawater}} reverse osmosis units (SWRO) for both good mechanical and corrosion resistance properties. However, many corrosion failures of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> in SWRO desalination units have been reported. These failures may often be attributed to un-adapted <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> grade selection and/or to the particular aggressive seawater conditions in "warm" regions (high ambient temperature, severe biofouling, etc.). Cathodic protection (CP) is a well-known efficient system to prevent corrosion of metallic materials in seawater. It is successfully used in {{the oil and gas}} industry to protect carbon steel structures exposed in open-sea. However, the specific service conditions of SWRO units may seriously affect the efficiency of such anti-corrosion system (high flow rates, large <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> surfaces affected by biofouling, confinement limiting protective cathodic current flow, etc.). Hence, CP in SWRO units should be considered with special care and modeling appears as useful tool to assess an appropriate CP design. However, there is a clear lack of CP data that could be transposed to SWRO service conditions (<b>i.</b> e. <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> effect of biofouling, high flow rate, etc.). From this background a Join Industry Program was initiated including laboratory exposures, field measurements in a full scale SWRO desalination plant, and modeling work using PROCOR software.

The duration of sintering was 60 seconds. Young’s modulus measurements were carried out using ultrasonic method. Mechanical properties were determined by Vickers hardness test. For microstructure observation scanning electron microscope JEOL JSM- 6460 LV was used. Findings: The decrease of the hardness of the sintered austenitic AISI 316 L <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> with the increasing temperature of sintering was observed. However, the Young’s modulus increases with the growth of the temperature of sintering. The results showed that the hardness increased with increasing pressure.

In comparison with <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> stent, cobalt chromium stent has a higher radial strength and radio-opacity for similar electronegativity, this allow for the production of thinner struts with a similar radiological visibility. Therefore we studied and compared six-months prognosis of cobalt chromium stent versus <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> Bare metal stents in diabetic patients undergoing PCI. Methods and ResultsOur study included seventy diabetic patients with Ischemic heart disease amendable to percutaneous stenting with stents ⩾ 3 mm in diameter and ⩽ 25 mm length. They were randomly assigned to cobalt chromium stents (Group <b>I)</b> or <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> stents (Group II). PCI was done with initial success and we excluded patients with unsuccessful PCI or complications during intervention, using <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> stent and chromium stent in the same lesion, left main stem lesions, osteal and bifurcational lesions. Our primary end point was Major adverse cardiac events (death, Myocardial infarction, unstable angina, emergency CABG or target lesion revascularization); over period of 6 months and our secondary end point was in-stent restenosis assessed by coronary angiography at 6 months in the follow up period. Total MACE in group (I) was 9 patients, coronary angiography was done for those patients after the cardiac event, that showed 7 patients with ISR and 2 of them showed patent stents. Patients without MACE whom undergone follow up coronary angiography after 6 months, revealed 6 patients suffered ISR out of 23 patients. While total MACE in group (II) was 5 patients, coronary angiography for those patients showed 4 patients with ISR and 1 of them showed patent stent. Patients without MACE whom undergone follow up coronary angiography after 6 months revealed 10 patients suffered ISR out of 28 patients.

A practical and cost effective bleaching alternative is chlorine dioxide manufactured entirely from sodium chlorate. Sodium chlorate is produced by the electrolysis of brine in an undivided cell with steel plate cathodes and dimensionally stable anodes. Although the overpotential at the anode is only 50 mV, the cathodic overpotential is 940 mV. Thus, nearly one volt of electricity is wasted in driving hydrogen evolution at the cathode. Auburn University's Center for Microfibrous Materials Manufacturing has demonstrated that high performance, three dimensional, microfibrous electrodes can improve the performance of capacitors, batteries, hybrid power cells, and electrolysis electrodes {{in a variety of}} applications. The goal of this research was to apply this technology to a chlorate cell's cathode and reduce the overpotential between 200 and 400 mV. An economic analysis of the industry has shown that for every 100 mV reduction in overpotential, $ 100 per square meter of electrode can be saved annually. Due to their enhanced surface area over plates, corrosion of microfibrous electrodes is a major issue in this research. Samples based on chromium protection (<b>i.</b> e. <b>stainless</b> <b>steel)</b> have proved unfeasible for chlorate application. However, samples based on <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and nickel show dramatic performance improvements over industry status quo in chlor-alkali application. Building microfibrous electrodes on a titanium base protected with a silver coating alleviates the corrosion problem and provides 100 mV or more of overpotential reduction. Further reduction is realized by impregnating silver-titanium microfibrous mesh with a PVDF binder and dispersed platinum on activated carbon. The resulting electrodes are mechanically sound, active towards hydrogen evolution, and hold promise for practical industry use...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{frictional}} resistance of titanium, self-ligating <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> and conventional <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> brackets, using <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and titanium molybdenum alloy (TMA) archwires. Materials and Methods: We compared the frictional resistance in 0. 018 slot and 0. 022 slot of the three brackets - titanium, self-ligating <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> and conventional <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> - using <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> archwires and TMA archwires. An in vitro study of simulated canine retraction was undertaken to evaluate the difference in frictional resistance between titanium, self-ligating <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> and <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> brackets, using <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and TMA archwires. Results and Conclusion: We compared the frictional resistance of titanium, self-ligating <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> and conventional <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> brackets, using <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and TMA archwires, with the help of Instron Universal Testing Machine. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Student′s "t" test, and post hoc multiple range test at level of < 0. 05 showed statistically significant difference in the mean values of all groups. Results demonstrated that the titanium, self-ligating <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> and <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> brackets of 0. 018 -inch and 0. 022 -inch slot had no significant variations in frictional résistance. The self-ligating bracket with TMA archwires showed relatively less frictional resistance compared with the other groups. The titanium bracket with TMA archwires showed relatively less frictional resistance compared with the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> brackets...|$|R
40|$|A novel type of {{macroporous}} molecularly imprinted hybrid silica monolithic {{column was}} first developed for recognition of proteins. The macroporous silica-based monolithic skeleton was synthesized in a 4. 6 mm <b>i.</b> d. <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> column by a mild sol-gel process with methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) as a sole precursor, and then vinyl groups were introduced {{onto the surface}} of the silica skeleton by chemical modification of gamma-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (gamma-MAPS). Subsequently, the molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) coating was copolymerized and anchored {{onto the surface of}} the silica monolith. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lysozyme (Lyz), which differ greatly in molecular size, isoelectric point, and charge, were representatively selected for imprinted templates to evaluate recognition property of the hybrid silica-based MIP monolith. Some important factors, such as template-monomer molar ratio, total monomer concentration and crosslinking density, were systematically investigated. Under the optimum conditions, the obtained hybrid silica-based MIP monolith showed higher binding affinity for template than its corresponding non-imprinted (NIP) monolith. The imprinted factor (IF) for BSA and Lyz reached 9. 07 and 6. 52, respectively. Moreover, the hybrid silica-based MIP monolith displayed favorable binding characteristics for template over competitive protein. Compared with the imprinted silica beads for stationary phase and in situ organic polymer-based hydrogel MIP monolith, the hybrid silica MIP monolith exhibited higher recognition, stability and lifetime.

40|$|Oak barrels {{have long}} been the {{preferred}} method for oak maturation of wine, but barrels contribute significantly to production costs, so alternate oak maturation regimens have been introduced, particularly for wines at lower price points. To date, few studies have investigated consumers’ acceptance of wines made using non-traditional oak treatments. In this study, two Cabernet Sauvignon wines were aged using traditional (i. e., barrel) and/or alternative (<b>i.</b> e., <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> or plastic tanks and vats, with oak wood added) maturation regimens. Chemical and sensory analyses were subsequently performed to determine the influence on wine composition and sensory properties, that is, the presence of key oak-derived volatile compounds and perceptible oak aromas and flavor. The quality of a subset of wines was rated {{by a panel of}} 10 wine experts using a 20 -point scoring system, with all wines considered technically sound. Consumer acceptance of wines was also determined. Hedonic ratings ranged from 5. 7 to 5. 9 (on a 9 -point scale), indicating {{there was no significant difference}} in consumers’ overall liking of each wine. However, segmentation based on individual liking scores identified three distinct clusters comprising consumers with considerably different wine preferences. These results justify wine producers’ use of alternative oak maturation regimens to achieve wine styles that appeal to different segments of their target market. A. M. Crump, T. E. Johnson, K. L.

The experimental data were obtained in a horizontal 2. 3 mm <b>I.</b> D <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> tube with heating length of 464 mm, R 134 a and R 245 fa as working fluids, mass velocities ranging from 50 to 700 kg m(- 2) s(- 1), heat flux from 5 to 55 kW m(- 2), exit saturation temperatures of 22, 31 and 41 degrees C, and vapor qualities ranging from 0. 05 to 0. 99. Flow pattern characterization was also performed from images obtained by high-speed filming. Heat transfer coefficient results from 1 to 14 kW m(- 2) K(- 1) were measured. It {{was found that the}} heat transfer coefficient is a strong function of heat flux, mass velocity and vapor quality. The experimental data were compared against ten flow boiling predictive methods from the literature. Liu and Winterton [3], Zhang et al. [5] and Saitoh et al. [6] worked best for both fluids, capturing most of the experimental heat transfer trends. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Studies have evaluated the effects of fixed orthodontic appliances on microbial flora and periodontal status, {{but only a few}} have evaluated the method of ligation as an additional factor. Aims and Objectives: To determine the amount of microbial colonization with different elastomeric ligation techniques. Material and Methods: Twenty subjects and a total of five ligature systems divided into five groups were chosen for the split mouth study. Group II and III (super slick ties and slide ligatures) were ligated over the premolars on the right side while Group IV and V (quick stick ties - angulated and easy to fit ties) were ligated over the premolars on the left side in both the arches. Group <b>I</b> (control) or <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> ties were made over the cuspids in the same manner. Elastomeric ligatures were removed after a period of 21 days and sent for culture. The amount of microbial colonies was then compared using stereomicroscope. Results: The amount of microbial colonization observed was statistically significant (P < 0. 001) in all the groups. Group III showed the highest microbial colonization while Group II showed the least. Conclusion: Super slick elastomeric ligatures were found to have minimal microbial adhesion similar to that of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the quantitative effects on torque expression of varying the slot size of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> orthodontic brackets and {{the dimension of}} <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> wire, and to analyze {{the limitations of the}} experimental methods used. Materials and Methods: In vitro studies measuring torque expression in conventional and self-ligating <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> brackets with a torque-measuring device, with the use of straight <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> orthodontic wire without second-order mechanics and without loops, coils, or auxiliary wires, were sought through a systematic review process. Results: Eleven articles were selected. Direct comparison of different studies was limited by differences in the measuring devices used and in the parameters measured. On the basis of the selected studies, in a 0. 018 inch <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> bracket slot, the engagement angle ranges from 31 degrees with a 0. 016 0. 016 inch <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> archwire to 4. 6 degrees with a 0. 018 0. 025 inch <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> archwire.
