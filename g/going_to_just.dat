500|$|In a June 2009 {{interview}} with Italy's Rock TV, Ulrich said Metallica {{was planning to}} continue touring until August 2010, {{and that there were}} no plans for a tenth album. He said he was sure the band would collaborate with producer Rick Rubin again. According to Blabbermouth.net, the band was considering recording its next album {{in the second half of}} 2011. In November 2010, during an {{interview with}} The Pulse of Radio, Ulrich said Metallica would return to writing in 2011. Ulrich said, [...] "There's a bunch of balls in the air for 2011, but I think the main one is we really want to get back to writing again. We haven't really written since, what, '06, '07, and we want to get back to kind of just being creative again. Right now we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> chill out and then probably start up again in, I'd say, March or April, and start probably putting the creative cap back on and start writing some songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Darabont wrote a 60-page pilot {{script for}} [...] "Days Gone Bye". His initial script for the episode was split {{in half and}} embellished. Darabont {{explained}} that he did this to [...] "slow the narrative down and dig into the characters more deeply, so it's not just plot-driven, event-driven stuff. You really want to drag these characters into the equation." [...] Darabont felt that instituting visual maneuvers would increase the surreal atmosphere of a scene. Upon reading the script, Kirkman thought that producers were consistent with his comic, adding that they could possibly improve his initial work. [...] "Reading that pilot was just a revelation. It's extremely faithful. There {{are things that are}} so much like the comic, I can't really remember the nuance of what's different and what's not from the comic. He's definitely being more faithful than I expected, and everything that he's changing is brilliant. I couldn't be happier. I think the fans of the book are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> love it." [...] The episode shares its name with volume one of the comic book series.|$|E
500|$|Transformers: The Ride was {{primarily}} developed by Universal Creative, {{the research and}} development division of Universal Parks & Resorts. Universal Creative's Thierry Coup was the Creative Director of the ride, having worked on previous Universal attractions including Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man, and Shrek 4-D. Michael Bay, director of the Transformers film franchise, collaborated with Universal Creative on the ride, despite an earlier blog post that suggested otherwise: [...] "I don't support it yet – I'm not involved and [...] not sure the story of the ride works, and I know Optimus is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> show up to be directed by some new people that have never worked with him," [...] he wrote. Bay's involvement in the attraction's development was revealed by Mark Woodbury, president of Universal Creative, in an NBC documentary on Islands of Adventure's Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Industrial Light & Magic developed the special effects for the ride, having previously worked on Transformers, [...] and [...] Each installation is reported to have cost US$100 million.|$|E

[...] "That's a complaint you hear mostly from people who don't empty slop jars. This country {{has a lot of}} people who do exactly that for a living. And they do it well. It's not pleasant work, but it's a living. And it has to be done. Somebody has to go around and empty all those bed pans. And it's perfectly honorable work. There's nothing the matter with doing it. Indeed, there is a lot that is right about doing it, as any hospital patient will tell you." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band's 1999 double album The Fragile was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics and was a commercial success, selling over two million copies {{by the end of}} the year. However, it failed to attain the success of its predecessor and fell from the top of the Billboard after only a week. Afterwards, the only original Nine Inch Nails material released until 2005 was the 2000 remix album Things Falling Apart, as well as the 2001 single [...] "Deep" [...] from the [...] and Still. Reznor told Spin magazine in 2005 that [...] "I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> drink myself or drug myself out of it.

2500|$|Pundits accused Dole {{of being}} a [...] "flip-flopper and a hypocrite." [...] Editorials ran in major newspapers, {{including}} The Washington Post, The New York Times, the Boston Globe, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and the Times of London, condemning Dole's action, joined by radio commentators Rush Limbaugh and Don Imus. [...] Under the pressure, Dole admitted during an October 1995 press briefing on Capitol Hill that he regretted the decision to return the check, and that his campaign was responsible for it without consulting him. [...] "I think if they'd have consulted me, we wouldn't have done that, wouldn't have returned it," [...] Dole said. Dole later told Washington Post editor and author Bob Woodward that the LCR episode was a [...] "mistake" [...] because the decision to return the check [...] "gets into Bob Dole the person. [...] It's {{not so much about}} Bob Dole the candidate. It's the person. [...] Is he tolerant? [...] Does he tolerate different views? [...] Tolerate someone with a different lifestyle?"

2500|$|During {{this time}} of her life she also was distant from her family, as she had married without their consent. According to Loveless, [...] "...I think my father thought I had lost my mind. This music is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> ruin your life... it ruined your life... But it was a music that I learned from again... You wouldn't believe the people that would come to this club. They would get off from work, and they wouldn't go home. They'd come to this club and have a few beers, or ... dance.... I {{learned a lot about}} people and life in those places. I mean there was all walks of life... people who had hit the very bottom. And myself, there was times I felt myself {{becoming}} one of those people too. There was some hard times for us both, my ex-husband and I. And I think at the time, it caused us to be torn apart, and we lost respect for each other.

[...] A low point of her life was in October 1979, when her father, whom she idolized, died near Louisville while Loveless was in North Carolina.|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{who live}} abroad are {{accustomed}} to believe that almost all Eretz Yisrael is now uninhabited desert and whoever wishes can buy land there as he pleases. [...] But this is not true. [...] It {{is very difficult to}} find in the land [...] cultivated fields that are not used for planting. [...] Only those sand fields or stone mountains that would require the investment of hard labour and great expense to make them good for planting remain uncultivated and that's because the Arabs do not like working too much in the present for a distant future. Therefore, {{it is very difficult to}} find good land for cattle. [...] And not only peasants, but also rich landowners, are not selling good land so easily...We who live abroad {{are accustomed to}} believing that the Arabs are all wild desert people who, like donkeys, neither see nor understand what is happening around them. [...] But this is a grave mistake. [...] The Arab, like all the Semites, is sharp minded and shrewd. [...] All the townships of Syria and Eretz Yisrael are full of Arab merchants who know how to exploit the masses and keep track of everyone with whom they deal – the same as in Europe. [...] The Arabs, especially the urban elite, see and understand what we are doing and what we wish to do on the land, but they keep quiet and pretend not to notice anything. [...] For now, they do not consider our actions as presenting a future danger to them. … But, if the time comes that our people's life in Eretz Yisrael will develop to a point where we are taking their place, either slightly or significantly, the natives are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> step aside so easily.|$|E
