40|$|The in vivo brain {{microdialysis}} {{technique has}} been used to study the ability of <b>itasetron,</b> [DAU 621 5, (3 -a-tropanyl) 1 H-benzimidazolone- 3 -carboxamide hydrochloride], a novel 5 -hy-droxytryptamine 3 (5 -HT) -receptor antagonist, to antagonize the effect of the o-agonist (+) -N-Allylnormetazocine (SKF 10, 047) in inducing the release of dopamine from mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, in comparison with halopendol and clozapine. SKF 10, 047 caused a dose-depen-dent increase in the release of endogenous dopamine prefer-entially from the nucleus accumbens septi with respect to the corpus striatum of the rat, the time to peak being 60 mm from its administration. <b>Itasetron</b> (1 - 30 pg/kg s. c. given 45 mm be-fore SKF 1 0, 047 5 mg/kg s. c.) dose dependently antagonized the SKF 10, 047 response in the nucleus accumbens septi an...|$|E
