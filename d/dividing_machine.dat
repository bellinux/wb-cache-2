Since the operating system resources, themselves, are too diversified to provide a consistent classification, the structure upon which resources are built and shared are examined. The location and control character of this indivisibility provides the taxonomy for separating uniprocessors, computer networks, network computers (fully distributed processing systems or decentralized computers) and algorithm and/or data control multiprocessors. The taxonomy {{is important because it}} <b>divides</b> <b>machines</b> into a classification that is relevant or important to the client and not the hardware architect.

40|$|Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) are high-dimensional vector {{representations}} of objects (eg., words, image parts), relations (eg., sentence structures), and sequences {{for use with}} machine learning algorithms. They consist of a vector addition operator for representing a collection of unordered objects, a Binding operator for associating groups of objects, and a methodology for encoding complex structures. We first develop Constraints that machine learning imposes upon VSAs: for example, similar structures must be represented by similar vectors. The constraints suggest that current VSAs should represent phrases ("The smart Brazilian girl") by binding sums of terms, in addition to simply binding the terms directly. We show that matrix multiplication {{can be used as}} the binding operator for a VSA, and that matrix elements can be chosen at random. A consequence for living systems is that binding is mathematically possible without the need to specify, in advance, precise neuron-to-neuron connection properties for large numbers of synapses. A VSA that incorporates these ideas, MBAT (Matrix Binding of Additive Terms), is described that satisfies all Constraints. With respect to machine learning, for some types of problems appropriate VSA representations permit us to prove learnability, rather than relying on simulations. We also propose <b>dividing</b> <b>machine</b> (and neural) learning and representation into three Stages, with differing roles for learning in each stage. For neural modeling, we give "representational reasons" for nervous systems to have many recurrent connections, {{as well as for the}} importance of phrases in language processing. Sizing simulations and analyses suggest that VSAs in general, and MBAT in particular, are ready for real-world applications. Comment: 41 page...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{contemporary}} {{relationship between the}} former Mau Mau and loyalists is much informed by the variegated nature of the struggle. The Mau Mau was itself a <b>divided</b> <b>machine.</b> A poorly developed aspect of the Mau Mau was the difference between high or deep forest Mau Mau and low or village Mau Mau. The latter were called Komerera. These operated in the villages, living furtively among the people at night and in aardvark holes by day. They crawled out {{under cover of darkness}} to demand food from the villagers, in negotiations that were often life or death issues. They were young men, ruthlessly committed to war. Their claim among the villagers was that of front soldiers representing the deep forest Mau Mau. The current land conflicts between former fighters and former loyalists is linked to traditional Kikuyu land issues. 1. A <b>divided</b> war <b>machine</b> To understand the contemporary social relationships between the former Mau Mau and loyalists, it is necessary to first reconstruct the strata that formed this social uprising in the 1950 s. It is often overlooked that the struggle for independence in Kenya was not a monolithic campaign by one regiment. Although the entity called Mau Mau was by far the most ideologically, numerically and purposefully solid, there were many transient groups before, during and immediately after independence. An example is the party of Wanjohi Mun’gau, kiama kiama kia Wanjohi wa Mung’au. We need not belabour the fact that the Mau Mau was a product of a varied past representing common aspirations, which were undeniably Kikuyu in origin (Furedi, 1989). These inspirations have over the years coalesce...|$|R

50|$|The myth started around 1984 when {{comparing}} the Apple II with the IBM PC. The argument {{was that the}} PC was five {{times faster than the}} Apple II, as its Intel 8088 processor had a clock speed roughly 5x the clock speed of the MOS Technology 6502 used in the Apple. However, what really matters is not how finely <b>divided</b> a <b>machine's</b> instructions are, but {{how long it takes to}} complete a given task. Consider the LDA # (Load Accumulator Immediate) instruction. On a 6502 that instruction requires two clock cycles, or 2 μs at 1 MHz. Although the 4.77 MHz 8088's clock cycles are shorter, the LDA # needs 4 of them, so it takes 4 / 4.77 MHz = 0.84 μs. So that instruction runs only a little more than 2 times as fast on the original IBM PC than on the Apple II.|$|R

3000|$|In {{addition}} to capturing alternative routing, we innovatively use {{the concept of}} REs as a basis to impose workload balancing among resources. In most previous studies considering workload balancing, a workload had to be evenly <b>divided</b> among <b>machines</b> that were deemed similar (though not necessarily identical). We approach workload balancing in a different way. A workload calling for a particular resource element is to be evenly <b>divided</b> among the <b>machines</b> that have this RE. For example, consider {{a system that has}} four machine tools (M 1,..., M 4) having a total of five resource elements (RE 1, [...]..., RE 5). Now assume machine tools M 1 and M 2 have RE 1 and RE 2; machine tool M 3 has RE 1, RE 2, RE 3 and RE 4; and machine tool M 4 has RE 3, RE 4 and RE 5. In our approach, we impose a constraint such that the workload using RE 1 and RE 2 is to be evenly distributed among M 1, M 2 and M 3 which have these resource elements; a workload using RE 3 and RE 4 is to be evenly divided among M 3 and M 4; and finally, a workload using RE 5 is to be entirely performed on M 4 as this is the only machine having RE 5. Therefore, the workloads of the two identical machines (M 1 and M 2) are balanced; the workload performed on M 3 is greater than the individual loads on M 1 and M 2 because M 3 has more Res; and there is not a workload balancing constraint between pairs of dissimilar machines (say M 1 and M 4). In other words, in our model workload balancing is (1) fully enforced among identical machines, (2) partially enforced among machines having some shared capabilities, and (3) not enforced among dissimilar machines.|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} between different analytical and finite-element (FE) tools for the computation of cogging torque and torque ripple in axial flux permanent-magnet synchronous machines is made. 2 D and 3 D FE models {{are the most}} accurate for the computation of cogging torque and torque ripple. However, they are too time consuming {{to be used for}} optimization studies. Therefore, analytical tools are also used to obtain the cogging torque and torque ripple. In this paper, three types of analytical models are considered. They are all based on <b>dividing</b> the <b>machine</b> into many slices in the radial direction. One model computes the lateral force based on the magnetic field distribution in the air gap area. Another model is based on conformal mapping and uses complex Schwarz Christoffel (SC) transformations. The last model is based on the subdomain technique, which divides the studied geometry into a number of separate domains. The different types of models are compared for different slot openings and permanent-magnet widths. One of the main conclusions is that the subdomain model is best suited to compute the cogging torque and torque ripple with a much higher accuracy than the SC model...|$|R

For providing on-demand and flexible provisioning of resources and services, it needs to utilize resources efficiently without any interruption due to maintenance and setup issues. For this purpose, resources are shared among various users {{in such a way}} that the requirement of all users can be fulfilled. Virtualization makes it possible by running multiple operating systems and multiple applications on a single physical <b>machine.</b> It <b>divides</b> physical <b>machine</b> into two or more virtual machines and each virtual machine operates as an independent environment. By means of virtual machine, cloud computing fulfills demands of resources and services for multiple users simultaneously.

40|$|With the {{continuous}} {{expansion of the}} amount of data with time in mobile video applications such as cloud video surveillance (CVS), the increasing energy consumption in video data centers has drawn widespread attention for the past several years. Addressing the issue of reducing energy consumption, we propose a low energy consumption storage method specially designed for CVS systems based onthe service level agreement (SLA) classification. A novel SLA with an extra parameter of access time period is proposed and then utilized as a criterion for <b>dividing</b> virtual <b>machines</b> (VMs) and data storage nodes into different classifications. Tasks can be scheduled in real time for running on the homologous VMs and data storage nodes according to their access time periods. Any nodes whose access time periods do not encompass the current time will be placed into the energy saving state while others are in normal state with the capability of undertaking tasks. As a result, overall electric energy consumption in data centers is reduced while the SLA is fulfilled. To evaluate the performance, we compare the method with two related approaches using the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The results show the superiority and effectiveness of our method...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the earlier phase of the osseointegration of a laser-treated implant surface in terms of human protein adsorption. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Titanium surfaces were <b>divided</b> into <b>machined</b> (M), sandblasted (SB), and laser-treated (LT). The LT surfaces were created with an Nd diode-pumped laser in Q-switching, whereas the SB were treated with Al 2 O 3. An x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of titanium surface was performed. Titanium discs were used for albumin and fibronectin adsorption evaluation through fluorescence intensity. Fibronectin evaluation was also made with Western Blot analysis on experimental implants. RESULTS: LT discs appeared to trigger a higher albumin and fibronectin adsorption with a regular pattern. The mean count of albumin adsorption was 0. 29 and 3. 8 for SB and LT, respectively (P = 0. 016), whereas fibronectin values were 0. 67 and 4. 9 for (SB) and (LT) titanium (P = 0. 02).
