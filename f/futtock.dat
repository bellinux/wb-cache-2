500|$|In 1969 Barker {{was able}} to write, produce and star as General <b>Futtock</b> in the film Futtocks End which {{featured}} no dialogue and only [...] "grumble and grunt". The Ronnie Barker Playhouse had been designed to find a successful idea for a sitcom, and the episode [...] "Ah, There You Are" [...] by Alun Owen, which introduced the bumbling aristocratic character Lord Rustless, was chosen. The character returned for the 1969–1970 series Hark at Barker as the main character; Barker wrote for the show under the name Jonathan Cobbald. As Wiley he wrote the 1971 series Six Dates with Barker. Despite Barker's success on ITV, LWT's programme controller Stella Richman opted to fire Frost's company Paradine (Frost was sacked from the LWT board) and as Barker was contracted to the company rather than the network, he lost his job, as did Corbett.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to overlapping the mast below, the top mast and topgallant mast were supported laterally by shrouds that connected {{to either a}} platform, called a [...] "top", or cross-wise beams, called [...] "crosstrees", and anchored <b>futtock</b> shrouds from below {{that led to the}} lower mast.|$|E
50|$|In {{the most}} {{traditional}} ships, the <b>futtock</b> shrouds {{can be used}} {{to gain access to the}} tops. Sailors ascend ratlines on the ordinary shrouds until nearly at the top, then transfer to the <b>futtock</b> shrouds which will be reaching upwards and outwards above them. Using the <b>futtock</b> shrouds involves climbing the underside of an overhanging rope at about 45 degrees. <b>Futtock</b> shrouds may or may not have ratlines.|$|E
50|$|In the {{construction}} of a wooden-hulled ship, the <b>futtocks</b> are the separate pieces of timber which compose the frame of the ship. There are four <b>futtocks</b> (component parts of the rib), and occasionally five, to a ship. Those next to the keel are called ground-futtocks, or navel-futtocks, and the rest are termed upper <b>futtocks.</b> The word itself is derived from a contraction of 'foot hook', indicating their role in providing a secure framework to a ship.|$|R

50|$|The {{schooner}} will be {{a perfect}} masterpiece of workmanship and beauty. The expense to us will be great, {{but there will be}} the satisfaction of her being strong and very durable. Her floor-timbers, keel, keel-son, stem and lower <b>futtocks</b> are oak. The transom, stern-post, upper <b>futtocks,</b> top-timbers, beams and knees are all red cedar. She will carry 350 barrels.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: As well as tops, {{crosstrees}} {{will also}} have <b>futtock</b> shrouds. Because crosstrees are smaller, there is less need for alternatives to the <b>futtock</b> shrouds as a way past them. This sailor is about to climb out round {{the edges of the}} crosstrees using the <b>futtock</b> shrouds.|$|E
50|$|In {{the mid-nineteenth}} century the <b>futtock</b> band was introduced, being a metal collar fitted to the mast below the top, to which the lower point of the <b>futtock</b> shrouds is {{attached}}. Before this the <b>futtock</b> shrouds were attached to the lower shrouds that rose directly to the top. In this arrangement lower shrouds must support a greater load, requiring the use of catharpins to provide bracing between port and starboard shrouds.|$|E

50|$|In June 2006 <b>Futtocks</b> End {{was shown}} {{on the big screen}} in Trafalgar Square in London for the St. George's Day celebrations, prior to Monty Python and the Holy Grail.|$|R
50|$|Barker reprised {{the role}} of Lord Rustless in the BBC series His Lordship Entertains, and played very similar {{characters}} in <b>Futtock's</b> End and the Two Ronnies specials The Picnic and By the Sea.|$|R
50|$|Rib - A {{thin strip}} of pliable timber laid athwart-wise inside the hull, from inwale to inwale, at regular close {{intervals}} {{to strengthen the}} exterior planking. The rib is often steamed to increase flexibility. The rib is traditionally fixed to the planking by rivets or copper nails bent over on the inside. This method is still used in small clinker built dinghies and similar craft. Ribs are attached after the planking is constructed. Ribs differ from frames or <b>futtocks</b> in being far smaller dimensions and bent in place compared to frames or <b>futtocks</b> which are normally sawn to shape, or natural crooks that are shaped to fit with an adze, axe or chisel.|$|R
5000|$|Any traditionally-rigged ship {{will have}} <b>futtock</b> shrouds, but on some modern ones they are {{strictly}} for structural purposes, with climbing forbidden. These ships may also dispense with lubbers' holes, and instead {{opt for a}} [...] "Jacob's ladder" [...] that descends {{from the edge of}} the top to the ratlines vertically, rather than overhanging like the <b>futtock</b> shrouds.|$|E
50|$|Access for sailors {{to the top}} may be by a Jacob's ladder, lubber's hole, or the <b>futtock</b> shrouds.|$|E
50|$|The {{frequently}} used word <b>futtock,</b> rarely encountered outside {{the radio show}} (apart from Ronnie Barker's comedy film Futtock's End), had a spillover effect on words like fetlock, {{as well as its}} obvious phonetic similarity to the words fuck and buttock. (<b>Futtock</b> is in fact a harmless nautical term — a shortening of the phrase 'foot-hook'.) The word nadger was already known from The Goon Show ("The Nadger Plague"), but is now generally understood to refer to the testicles.|$|E
50|$|From 1963, {{the house}} was used mainly as a {{location}} for films and television, including <b>Futtocks</b> End and The Avengers. It was converted into Grim's Dyke Hotel in 1970 but continues {{to be used as a}} film location. The hotel retains 30 of the original 110 acres of land that Gilbert purchased with the house.|$|R
50|$|During the 1960s a {{new series}} of 'sound effect' comedies began with Dick Lester, Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers's Running Jumping & Standing Still, {{continued}} through Eric Sykes's The Plank, Barbara Windsor's San Ferry Ann and included four films with Ronnie Barker: A Home of Your Own, <b>Futtock's</b> End, The Picnic, and By the Sea.|$|R
50|$|Her first noted {{appearance}} was alongside Ronnie Barker in the comedy <b>Futtock's</b> End in 1970. Following small roles with Frankie Howerd {{in the films}} of Up Pompeii and Up the Chastity Belt (1971) she secured a regular part in the sitcom Doctor in Charge in 1972 playing Nurse Sandra Crumpton. This role ran for six episodes of the first series. Soon after she appeared as Gretel in the 1972 film The Pied Piper starring Donovan.|$|R

5000|$|In wooden shipbuilding, each {{frame is}} {{composed}} of several sections, so that {{the grain of the}} wood can follow the curve of the frame. Starting from the keel, these are the floor (which crosses the keel and joins the frame to the keel), the first <b>futtock,</b> the second <b>futtock,</b> the top timber, and the rail stanchion. [...] In steel shipbuilding, the entire frame can be formed in one piece by rivetting or welding sections; in this case the floor remains a separate piece, joining the frame on each side to the keel.|$|E
5000|$|As well as {{climbing}} the <b>futtock</b> shrouds, most ships also allowed {{access to the}} top through the [...] "lubber's hole" [...] {{at the tip of}} the ordinary ratlines. However, this was generally scorned by experienced sailors, and reserved for those on their first few trips aloft.|$|E
5|$|A {{flat-bottomed}} design {{made her}} well-suited to sailing in shallow waters and {{allowed her to}} be beached for loading and unloading of cargo and for basic repairs without requiring a dry dock. Her hull, internal floors, and <b>futtocks</b> were built from traditional white oak, her keel and stern post from elm, and her masts from pine and fir. Plans of the ship also show a double keelson to lock the keel, floors and frames in place.|$|R
2500|$|As {{submitted}} by Dolliver & Sleeper - [...] "Only a practised mechanical eye could detect a little inequality in her sides, in consequence of her {{having had a}} heel to port. We have replaced the keel, sternpost, stern-knee, part of the keelson, all the floor timbers, most of the first <b>futtocks</b> and the garboard strake on the starboard side; but the stem and fore-foot, the top timbers and deck are gone. Enough of her, however, remains to enable us to form a fair estimate of her general outline when complete.|$|R
50|$|Markham {{has had a}} {{long career}} in the cinema, {{television}} and theatre as an actress. Among her television appearances are roles in Edward & Mrs. Simpson, The Life and Times of David Lloyd George, A Very British Coup, Van der Valk, The Line of Beauty, Minder, Cracker, Agatha Christie's Poirot (The Double Clue), and Mr Selfridge. Her films include Bunny Lake Is Missing (1965), <b>Futtocks</b> End (1970), François Truffaut's Two English Girls (1971), Operation Daybreak (1975), Noroît (1976), The Blood of Hussain (1980), Outland (1981, as Sean Connery's wife), The Innocent (1985), Wonderland (1999), Esther Kahn (2000), Killing Me Softly (2002) and Franklyn (2008).|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to overlapping the mast below, the top mast and topgallant mast were supported laterally by shrouds that connected {{to either a}} platform, called a [...] "top", or cross-wise beams, called [...] "crosstrees", and anchored <b>futtock</b> shrouds from below {{that led to the}} lower mast.|$|E
50|$|The oars {{did not use}} {{rowlocks}} or {{thole pins}} but square holes cut below the gunwale line. The holes were also used for belaying mooring lines and sail sheets. At the bow the forward upper <b>futtock</b> protruded about 400 mm above the sheerline and was carved to retain anchor or mooring lines.|$|E
5000|$|Frame - the {{transverse}} {{structure that}} gives a boat its cross-sectional shape. Frames may be solid or peripheral. They may be made of wood, plywood, steel, aluminium or composite materials. They may be removed after construction to save weight or to be reused or left in-situ. In ancient shipbuilding the frames were put in after the planking but now most boats are built with the frames first. This gives greater control over the shape. [...] "Lofting" [...] is the process used to create life-size drawings of frames {{so they can be}} manufactured. Today frames can be cut directly from a computer programme by a robot, with extreme accuracy. In old heavily built, square rigged ships, the frames were made up of 4 individual timbers called futtocks, as it was impossible to make the shape from a single piece of wood. The <b>futtock</b> closest to the keel was the ground <b>futtock</b> and the other pieces were called upper futtocks.|$|E
50|$|Live {{television}} {{coverage of the}} contest was largely abandoned by the BBC {{as a result of}} a trade union dispute typical of the era in Britain, when sound engineers refused to work, and the BBC decided shortly beforehand that it could not show live pictures without a commentary. The parade of the contestants in their national costumes and each of the entrants in their evening wear had been recorded the night before, so this was televised, followed later in the evening with the crowning of the winner with mute pictures narrated by Ray Moore. A unscheduled repeat of <b>Futtocks</b> End was televised to bridge the two segments. For later overseas transmission, a commentary was added to the silent pictures of the entire event, but the interviews with the final 7 contestants were never shown.|$|R
5000|$|After Lady Gilbert's death, the {{contents}} of the house, apart from a few items kept by Nancy McIntosh, were sold at public auction on 17 and 18 March 1937, realising £4,600. The house was acquired jointly by the Middlesex County Council and the London County Council, who leased it to the North West Regional Hospital Board from 1937 to 1962, at first as a rehabilitation centre for women suffering from tuberculosis (the house was used by the services during the World War II). [...] Following the war, both sexes were admitted, and from 1948 only male patients were admitted. From 1963, the house was used primarily as a location for films and television, including <b>Futtock's</b> End with Ronnie Barker. It was converted into a hotel in 1970. It was featured in John Betjeman's acclaimed television documentary Metro-land (1973). The hotel was seen in an off set episode of EastEnders in 2003.|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Nautical archaeology has enormously enriched our knowledge of ship construction, but so far most attention seems to have been lavished on ancient shipwrecks. The seventeenth century has attracted the least attention. No detailed studies of the construction of ships of this era have been published. When the subject is mentioned at all, it is a cursory overview, quite often inaccurate, always lacking depth. Extensive documentation, however, still survives in the form of shipbuilding treatises, contracts, correspondence, models, paintings and engravings, draughts, and last - but not least - archaeological remains. A number of modern attempts to describe the framing of the seventeenth-century ship exist, but none are dedicated studies of the subject. The most influential book is probably the work of Peter Goodwin - Construction of the English Man of War 1650 - 1850. Brian Lavery writes of construction in his books Ship of the Line, volume II, and Susan Constant, and he describes his reconstruction of Resolution, launched in 1667, in Deane's Doctrine of Naval Architecture. Lavery favors a multi-futtock arrangement, supporting the view that frames had no open spaces. Goodwin proposes a very similar model, but with double frames and his timbers are scarphed instead of butting. Yet the models and some illustrative material show a different framing pattern of overlapping floors and <b>futtocks.</b> For most of the period all contemporary sources agree that no more than two <b>futtocks</b> were employed. The following pages attempt to systematize the available evidence and, without claiming to be the last word on the subject or to have exhausted all sources, to show the development of framing in the sailing men-of-war throughout the seventeenth century. The emphasis will be on English warships, as evidence for them is more easily accessible and because English vessels of the seventeenth century, unlike those of the eighteenth, were well designed...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Futtock</b> shrouds are rope, wire or {{chain links}} in the rigging of a {{traditional}} square rigged ship. They run from the outer edges of a top downwards and inwards to a point on the mast or lower shrouds, and carry the load of the shrouds that rise {{from the edge of}} the top. This prevents any tendency of the top itself to tilt relative to the mast.|$|E
50|$|The second {{applies to}} a kind of ladder found on square rigged ships. To climb above the lower mast to the topmast and above, sailors must get around the top, a {{platform}} projecting from the mast. Although on many ships the only way round was the overhanging <b>futtock</b> shrouds, modern-day tall ships often provide an easier vertical ladder from the ratlines as well. This is the Jacob's ladder.|$|E
50|$|Futtocks End is a British comedy film {{released}} in 1970, directed by Bob Kellett. Entirely silent, with a musical score, sound effects and incoherent mutterings, the story revolves around a weekend gathering at the decaying country {{home of the}} eccentric and lewd General <b>Futtock</b> (Ronnie Barker) and the series of saucy mishaps between the staff (Michael Hordern plays the lecherous butler) and his guests. It was filmed at Grim's Dyke, the former home of W. S. Gilbert, now a hotel.|$|E
50|$|The Archaeological Diving Unit (ADU) {{conducted}} {{a number of}} dives on the site {{over the next three}} decades and since 1999 technology has been applied in the form of magnetometer and side-scan sonar surveys. The wreck was originally identified by the discovery of a bell and stock with the naval broad arrow and date; subsequently the ADU have found guns, two copper cauldrons and an anchor. The site consists of a large mound approximately 40 m long by 20 m wide, lying NW/SE near Fork Spit on {{the western edge of the}} Goodwin Sands. Parts are 3 m above the surrounding seabed, but much of the structure is thought to be buried below the sand. A dense turf of juvenile mussels covers most features, making it hard to identify them. There is a coherent piece of ship's structure just south of the centre of the designated area, with large timbers and some exposed planking, possibly corresponding to the region between the first and second <b>futtocks</b> (ribs) of the vessel.|$|R
50|$|Kellett's {{first feature}} film as producer, in 1964, was A Home of Your Own, {{starring}} Ronnie Barker as a worker on a building site where a couple, the husband played by Richard Briers, buy a home. In 1966 {{he wrote and}} produced the comedy San Ferry Ann, starring Joan Sims, Wilfrid Brambell and Barbara Windsor. In 1967 he produced the comedy Just Like a Woman, starring Wendy Craig, and, in 1969, he directed and produced <b>Futtocks</b> End starring Ronnie Barker and Michael Hordern. He was chosen by producer Ned Sherrin to direct Frankie Howerd comedies, and he made Up Pompeii and Up the Chastity Belt in 1971, and Up the Front in 1972. In 1971 he directed Girl Stroke Boy starring Michael Hordern and Joan Greenwood as a couple whose son {{falls in love with}} a black transvestite. He directed the wartime farce Our Miss Fred starring Danny La Rue in 1972, The Alf Garnett Saga starring Warren Mitchell in 1972, Don't Just Lie There, Say Something! starring Brian Rix, Leslie Phillips and Joanna Lumley in 1973, Spanish Fly starring Leslie Phillips and Terry-Thomas in 1975, and the big-screen version of Are You Being Served? in 1977. For television he directed episodes of Space: 1999, between 1975 and 1976, and the series Seagull Island in 1981.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{selective}} compendium of measurements and features relating to framing from Mediterranean shipwrecks dating from the 5 th century B. C. E. through the 9 th century C. E., {{with the goal of}} better understanding the transition from shell-based to frame-based ship construction. With a few notable exceptions, little more than cursory measurements and analyses are published regarding the framing pattern in ancient Mediterranean ships, a system that has been broadly and nondescriptly labeled as ?floor timbers alternating with paired half-frames. ? From its first appearance until the 6 th century C. E., the pattern of floor timbers alternating with paired half-frames remains in relative stasis with only a few notable developments. Framing continues to be a non-integrated and secondary form of hull rigidity until the 8 th and 9 th centuries C. E. when a new system appears ? successive and alternating L-shaped floor timbers extended by non-fastened <b>futtocks,</b> or in-line framing. The reasons for the quick adoption of this new system are not entirely clear, but are likely economic in nature. Regardless, the introduction of in-line framing, along with the transition away from strong hull edge-joinery, prompted the obsolescence of the centuries-old arrangement of floor timbers alternating with paired half-frames. While framing systems in ancient Mediterranean ships have received little focused attention in the past, {{it is clear that the}} incremental changes between the 4 th century B. C. E. and the 9 th century C. E. reveal larger patterns in ship construction...|$|R
