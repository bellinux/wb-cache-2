40|$|Abstract: Soluble fibre (SF) is an {{important}} nutrient to enhance fermentative activity and gut health in rabbits. The main source of SF in rabbit diets is sugar beet pulp (SBP), whereas, due to its high content of SF (34 %), <b>dried</b> <b>chicory</b> <b>pulp</b> (ChP) could be an alternative to SBP. In a fattening trial with 192  hybrid weanlings 32  d old weighing 837 ± 45  g, chicory pulp was used in replacement of SBP to study effects on production performances and slaughter characteristics. Rabbits were fed one of 4  iso-energetic (9. 65  MJ digestible energy/kg) and iso-nitrogenous (15. 6 % crude protein) diets: a negative control (NC) diet with a low dietary SF content (7. 3 %), a positive control diet with quite a high SBP level (13. 5 %) and SF content (10. 6 %) and 2  diets with respectively 10 % and 20 % of chicory pulp (ChP 10 : 9. 9 % SF and ChP 20 : 13. 7 % SF). The SF content was measured as the difference between total dietary fibre and neutral detergent fibre, the latter corrected for ash and protein content. Each dietary treatment consisted of 12  replicates of 4  rabbits. Weight gain was high (on av. 54  g/d) and comparable for the NC, SBP and ChP diets. However, feed conversion ratio was improved (P< 0. 05) with the ChP 20  diet compared to the NC diet (2. 88  vs. 2. 97). Mortality was low and not influenced by the dietary treatment. Slaughter data were very similar and no effect of the SF level on caecal weight or slaughter yield was observed. It was concluded that chicory pulp is a good alternative soluble fibre source in balanced diets for rabbits {{and can be used}} at least up to 20 % inclusion rate.

40|$|Two similar {{trials were}} carried out to examine how dietary {{inclusion}} of an easily fermentable carbohydrate source such as chicory roots (Cichorium intybus) may effect established and establishing helminth infections in pigs. In the first trial varying feeding periods with crude chicory roots naturally rich in fructans (primarily inulin) were tested whereas crude chicory roots were compared with <b>dried</b> <b>chicory</b> roots and purified inulin in the second trial. In both trials pigs were infected with 3000 O. dentatum L 3 -larvae while fed a traditional standard diet. When the infections were well established and patent, experimental diets were introduced and the faecal egg counts monitored. Two weeks before the pigs were slaughtered all animals were infected with 3000 O. dentatum L 3 -larvae and 2000 A. suum eggs. In trial 1, substitution of 25 % of the daily energy intake with crude chicory roots initially decreased the excretion of O. dentatum eggs but slowly increased again over the 9 week feeding period. In trial 2, similar results were seen during a 6 week feeding period while <b>dried</b> <b>chicory</b> roots almost completely eliminated egg excretion. The effect on egg excretion did not seem due to elimination of adult worms but {{may have been the}} result of impaired fitness and a lower mating frequency of adult worms. The number of recovered immature O. dentatum were reduced by 4, 6, and 9 weeks feeding with crude chicory as well as 6 weeks on inulin or died chicory. The latter also seemed to impair or slow down the development of the larvae. The number of recovered A. suum larvae was also reduced by crude <b>chicory</b> roots, <b>dried</b> <b>chicory</b> roots and purified inulin. Overall, the <b>dried</b> <b>chicory</b> product had the most significant impact on the helminth infections...|$|R

40|$|Swine {{dysentery}} (SD) is a contagious mucohaemorrhagic {{diarrhoeal disease}} with severe impacts on production efficiency in grower/finisher pigs. The causative agent of SD is the intestinal spirochaete Brachyspira hyodysenteriae that induces inflammation and necrosis of the caecum and colon (Hampson et al., 2006). Recently, Thomsen et al.

40|$|Boar taint is an {{off-flavour}} of pork caused {{primarily by}} a microbial breakdown product, skatole and a testicular steroid, androstenone. As skatole {{is produced in}} the large intestine from tryptophan, {{it is possible that}} some "bioactive" ingredients could modify protein fermentation and, in the process, diminish boar taint. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of inulin-rich chicory roots (Cichorium intybus L.) on boar taint. In the first of three trials individually penned, entire males and females were given an organic concentrate in which 0 · 25 of the daily energy intake was replaced with crude chicory roots for 9 or 4 weeks prior to slaughter. In the second trial, entire male pigs were given diets that included, either crude <b>chicory</b> roots, <b>dried</b> <b>chicory</b> roots, or inulin (extracted from chicory roots) for 6 weeks pre-slaughter. In the third trial, intact male pigs were given the <b>dried</b> <b>chicory</b> diet for either 2 or 1 week before slaughter. In all trials the chicory diets were offered on a scale at 0 · 95 of the Danish recommendation for energy intake, and pig performance was compared with a control group given the organic concentrate at 0 · 95 of recommended energy intake plus silage ad libitum. In trial 1 an additional control group was offered the organic concentrate at a daily energy intake level of 1 · 0 of Danish recommendations. The pigs in trials 1, 2, and 3 were slaughtered at an average live weight of 118, 124, and 110 kg, respectively, in order to ensure that they had achieved sexual maturity. Overall, skatole concentrations in blood plasma and backfat at slaughter were reduced to almost zero levels by including crude or <b>dried</b> <b>chicory</b> or inulin in the diet. This occurred irrespective of sex and length of feeding period (1 to 9 weeks). In trial 3 a significant effect on blood plasma concentration was observed after 3 days of feeding a diet containing <b>dried</b> <b>chicory.</b> The only significant reduction in plasma androstenone levels was detected in pigs given the crude chicory for a 9 week duration in trial 1. The production and proportion of lean was generally not affected by the addition of either form of chicory to the diets in trials 1 and 2. Therefore, <b>dried</b> <b>chicory</b> may be the most suitable form for commercial use because it: had no initial adverse effects on food intake, consistently reduced skatole without reducing performance, was easy to handle throughout the entire year and is relatively inexpensive. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the differences in microbial activity of five faecal inocula from weaned pigs and one faecal inoculum from unweaned pigs in combination with 6 substrates. The substrates tested were negative control diet, corn, soybean meal, oligofructose (OF), ground chicory roots and a mixture (60 % <b>chicory</b> <b>pulp</b> and 40 % OF). The inocula used were derived from pigs fed either a corn-soy based diet without antibiotics (NCON), the NCON diet supplemented with oligofructose (OF), a mixture of <b>chicory</b> <b>pulp</b> (40 %) and OF (60 %) (MIX), ground chicory roots (CHR) or the NCON diet supplemented with antibiotics (PCON). The cumulative gas production measured fermentation kinetics and end products, such as total gas production, ammonia and volatile fatty acids, were also determined. Both the substrate and the inoculum significantly affected the fermentation characteristics. The cumulative gas production curve showed that different substrates caused more differences in traits of fermentation kinetics than the different inocula. Inocula of weaned pigs gave a significantly higher VFA production compared to the inoculum from unweaned animals, whilst the rate of fermentation and the total gas produced did not differ. OF showed the highest fermentation kinetics and the lowest NH 3, pH and OM loss compared to other substrates. It was concluded that the microbial activity was significantly affected by substrate and inoculum. Inoculum from weaned pigs had more potential for microbial fermentation of the carbohydrate ingredients and oligofructose than that of unweaned pigs.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of an inulin source (aqueous or aqueous-alcoholic extract, <b>dried</b> <b>chicory</b> root, or <b>dried</b> Jerusalem artichoke tubers) on piglet performance, plasma lipid profile, and immunoglobulin concentration. The study was conducted on 534 piglets (44 litters) allocated to five nutritional groups: group I (control) - fed basal diet, groups II and III receiving basal diet supplemented with 2 % of inulin (aqueous and aqueous-alcoholic extract respectively), and groups IV and V - 4 % additive of dried artichoke or <b>dried</b> <b>chicory</b> respectively. During the trial, piglets’ body weight, feed intake, diarrhoea incidence, and mortality were controlled. Blood samples were collected twice from six animals of each group. In blood plasma, indices of lipid profile and concentrations of IgA, IgG and IgM were measured. The addition of inulin, regardless of its form (extracts or dried plants), significantly improved the rearing indices. In piglets of groups III, IV and V a significant improvement of daily weight gains and feed efficiency was noted. Inulin showed hypolipidemic activity (lowered total cholesterol level) and stimulated piglet immune system manifested by elevated IgA and IgG concentrations. Irrespective of the inulin source, a lower mortality rate resulting from the improvement of animal health was noted in all experimental groups...|$|R

Lupines significantly reduced skatole in backfat for both genders whilst chicory showed {{no significant differences in}} this re-spect. From a sensory perspective, chicory and lupine reduced boar taint since odour and flavour of manure related to skatole and urine associated to androstenone were minimised.

Several incorporation rates of different fibre sources (cellulose, guar gum, inulin, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), pectins, beet fibre, beet <b>pulp</b> and <b>chicory</b> <b>pulp)</b> were studied. Furthermore, a blend of cellulose and guar gum was formulated to imitate the ratio of soluble-to-insoluble fibre of beet fibre to study {{the influence of the}} fibre solubility. Drinking water consumption was increased by beet fibre and inulin in the diet. With the exception of cellulose for dry matter (DM) concentration, the different fibres induced similar effects on faeces: increased daily excretion, decreased DM concentration and increased excretion of DM. Nutrient digestibility coefficients were diversely affected by fibre consumption and, excepted for the ether extract, decreased in nutrients digestibility were in relation with added total or insoluble fibre in the diet. Important metabolic effects were observed but were not in relation with the solubility of the fibre. Decreased pre- and/or postprandial plasmatic concentrations of glucose (with FOS), insulin (with guar gum), urea, cholesterol (with guar gum) and triglycerides (with FOS) suggest that most of the studied fibres should be used as an aid for dogs suffering from obesity, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipaemia, chronic renal insufficiency or constipation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} different experimental gnawing blocks as cage enrichment in rabbits. One hundred and five pregnant rabbit does housed in conventional wire cages were distributed according to their parity number in 4 homogenous treatment groups. Throughout one complete reproductive cycle (from day 18 of pregnancy till weaning of the litter), does either received no enrichment (controls) or a gnawing block hung from a wire on the cage wall. The 3 different blocks had the same basal components (wheat, molasses and oligoelements), but additionally wood mash (WM), wood mash+chicory pulp (ChP) or wood mash and inulin syrup (I) were respectively incorporated. After weaning, each litter continued to receive the same blocks as before and block consumption was measured as well as the performance of the fatteners. Weight development during the lactation was comparable except in does that received the wood powder blocks. These females had a significantly lower weight (P< 0. 05) at different time points compared to controls. Litter weight or kit weight was not significantly different at any of the time points measured, but again the treatment with wood powder blocks presented the lowest weight. The consumption of blocks during the whole reproduction cycle (42 d) was 11. 0 ± 1. 1; 6. 8 ± 1. 0 and 4. 4 ± 0. 7 g/d per cage for wood mash, <b>chicory</b> <b>pulp</b> or inulin enriched blocks, respectively. A very high variability in consumption of blocks was observed between females. This varied between 1 and 5 (I or ChP group) or even 1 and 9 blocks (WM group) per reproductive cycle. In fatteners, daily block consumption was significantly different (P< 0. 05) and reached on average 7. 0 ± 0. 5; 3. 9 ± 0. 5 and 2. 2 ± 0. 2 g/d per fattener, respectively for WM, ChP and I. Five females with a block and 5 females without a block were observed for 1 h 3 d before the expected parturition and at 2 time points during lactation. Distinction was made between 15 different behaviours. Although the presence of a block did not significantly increase the total number of behavioural transitions, locomotion and intake behaviour were significantly (P< 0. 05) increased when a gnawing block was available. The observation period influenced the frequency of many behavioural transitions and before parturition was significantly higher than post parturition, respectively 56. 1 ± 11. 1 vs. 13. 7 ± 3. 8 (Week 1, P< 0. 01) and 25. 1 ± 5. 5 (Week 2, P< 0. 01). However, a very large variability was observed between does and, moreover, some does were mostly inactive after parturition during the observation period. Based on the consumption pattern and behaviour, these gnawing blocks could be considered as cage enrichment and those with the <b>chicory</b> <b>pulp</b> best fulfilled the objective of a suitable gnawing material...|$|R

The objective of this research project was to compare potential prebiotic effects and fermentability of five commonly consumed fibers using an in vitro fermentation system measuring changes in fecal microbiota, total gas production and formation of common SCFAs. Fecal donations were collected from three healthy volunteers. Materials analyzed included: pure beta-glucan, Oatwell (commercially available oat-bran containing 22 % oat β-glucan), xylooligosaccharides (XOS), WholeFiber (<b>dried</b> <b>chicory</b> root containing inulin, pectin, and hemi/celluloses), and pure inulin. Oatwell had the highest production of propionate at 12 h (4. 76 μmol/mL) compared to inulin, WholeFiber and XOS samples (p < 0. 03). Oatwell’s effect was {{similar to those of the}} pure beta-glucan samples, both samples promoted the highest mean propionate production at 24 h. XOS resulted in a significant increase in the genus Bifidobacterium after 24 h of fermentation (0 h: 0. 67 OTUs (operational taxonomic unit); 24 h: 5. 22 OTUs; p = 0. 038).

Faecal inocula collected from unweaned (5 kg body weight (BW)) and weaned piglets (15 kg BW) were introduced in airtight 100 -mL bottles containing 0. 5 g of substrate (basal or mix) in pre-warmed buffered medium. The organic matter cumulative volume (OMCV) was measured for 48 h, and a mono-phasic model was fitted to the data. The concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and ammonia (NH 3) was determined after fermentation. Incubation of substrate mix with the different inocula gave a significant higher OMCV compared to substrate basal, except for the inoculum from piglets of the CONAB group. In addition, substrate mix gave a higher Rmax and a lower Tmax compared to substrate basal. With the exception of inoculum obtained from chicory root supplemented animals (CHR) no substrate effects were observed in fermentation end-products (VFA and NH 3). However, the proportions of acetic acid were significantly higher and those of butyric acid lower when inocula were incubated with substrate mix. Inocula from weaned pigs tended to show higher proportions of propionic acid when incubated with substrate mix, whilst inocula from unweaned piglets showed the opposite. The differences in fermentation kinetics between substrates after incubation with inocula from weaned and unweaned piglets in combination with an altered composition in VFA, points to a modified faecal microflora following weaning...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the in vivo effect of chicory root on testicular steroid concentrations and androstenone metabolizing enzymes in entire male pigs.

The pigs {{were divided into two}} groups; one receiving experimental feed containing 10 % <b>dried</b> <b>chicory</b> root for 16 days before slaughter, the control group was fed a standard diet. Plasma, adipose and liver tissue samples were collected at slaughter. Plasma was analyzed for the concentration of testosterone, estradiol, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF- 1), skatole and indole. Adipose tissue was analyzed for the concentration of androstenone, skatole and indole, while the liver tissue was analyzed for mRNA and protein expressions of 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 β-HSD), sulfotransferase 2 A 1 and heat-shock protein 70 (HSP 70). The results showed that the androstenone concentrations in the adipose tissue of chicory fed pigs were significantly (p < 0. 05) lower and indole concentrations were higher (p < 0. 05) compared to control fed pigs. Moreover the chicory root fed pigs had increased mRNA and protein expression of 3 β-HSD and decreased HSP 70 expression (p < 0. 05). Testosterone and IGF- 1 concentrations in plasma as well as skatole concentrations in adipose tissue were not altered by dietary intake of chicory root.

Sequential extractions of CRP showed that hot water extraction solubilized arabinan-rich pectin and inulin, each representing 6 % of all CRP sugars. A significant amount of pectic sugars (46 %) rich in uronic acid from CRP was solubilized by chelating agents. Both dilute alkali extraction, which solubilized branched pectin (14 % from CRP), and concentrated alkali extraction, which solubilized hemicellulose dominant in yloglucans (2. 5 %) mostly of the XXXG type and mannan (0. 9 %), from CRP CWPs seemed to influence the WHC of CRP. Alkali-insoluble residue (39 % of CRP sugars) mainly comprised cellulose and some branched pectin (17 % from CRP). Ensiling reduced the methyl esterification of pectin, caused degradation of homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan, and possibly modified the xyloglucan, mannan, and glucan network, reducing the WHC from 6 mL/g to 3. 4 mL/g...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the in vitro fermentation of <b>chicory</b> root <b>pulp</b> (CRP) and ensiled CRP (ECRP) using human fecal inoculum.

For ECRP, having the same cell wall polysaccharide composition as CRP, but with solubilization of 4 times more of CRP pectin due to ensiling, the fermentation was quicker than with CRP as 11 % more carbohydrates were utilized within the first 12 h. The level of fiber utilization for ECRP after 24 h was increased by 8 % compared to CRP. This effect on fiber utilization from ECRP seemed to arise from (i) increased levels of soluble pectin fibers (arabinan, homogalacturonan, and galactan) and (ii) ahypothesized more open structure of the remaining cell walls in ECRP, which was more accessible to degradation than the CRP cell wall network. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|R

40|$|The {{restrictions}} {{on the use of}} antibiotic and anthelmintic treatments in organic pig farming necessitate alternative non-medical control strategies. Therefore, the antibiotic and parasite-reducing effect of a fructan-rich (prebiotic) diet of <b>dried</b> <b>chicory</b> was investigated in free-ranging piglets. Approximately half of 67 piglets from 9 litters were experimentally infected with Ascaris suum and Trichuris suis in the suckling period (1 to 7 weeks of age) and 58 of the piglets were challenged daily with E. coli O 138 :F 8 for 9 days after weaning to induce weaning diarrhoea. The litters were fed either chicory (30 % DM) or a control diet. The effect of chicory on intestinal helminths, intestinal microbiota, especially Bifidobacteria and Campylobacter spp., and E. coli post-weaning diarrhoea was assessed. The weight gain of the piglets was not impaired significantly by chicory. The intestinal A. suum worm burden was reduced by 64 % (P= 0. 034) in the chicory-fed piglets, whereas these same piglets had 63 % more T. suis worms (P= 0. 016). Feeding with chicory elicited no changes among the main bacterial groups in ileum according to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. However, the terminal-restriction fragment (T-RF) 208 bp, which may belong to Lachnospiraceae, was stimulated by the chicory feed (P= 0. 03), and T-RF 370 bp that matches Enterobacter belonging to the Enterobacteria was reduced (P= 0. 004). Additionally, chicory increased the level of Bifidobacteria (P= 0. 001) and the faecal Campylobacter excretion level was transitorily reduced in chicory-fed piglets at 7 weeks of age (P= 0. 029). Unfortunately, {{it was not possible to}} assess the effect of chicory on post-weaning diarrhoea as it did not develop. In conclusion, feeding piglets chicory around the time of weaning caused complex changes of the microbiota and parasite communities within the intestinal tract, and feeding piglets chicory may therefore serve as an animal-friendly strategy to control pathogens...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to monitor cell wall {{polysaccharide}} (CWPs) utilization during fermentation by the human colonic microbiota in the TNO in vitro model of the colon (TIM- 2). <b>Chicory</b> root <b>pulp</b> (CRP) and treated (ensiled) CRP (ECRP) containing four times more soluble pectin than CRP, were fermented in the model. After the adaptation phase of the human fecal inoculum to CRP and ECRP for 48 h, both materials were fermented quite rapidly (57 % carbohydrate utilization in 2 h). ECRP carbohydrates (85 %) were less fermented in 24 h compared to CRP carbohydrates (92 %). It was hypothesized that soluble fibers that are readily fermentable and dominantly present in ECRP programmed the microbiota in TIM- 2 to fully adapt to these soluble fibers which was not able to change towards the fermentation of insoluble fibers anymore. Consequently, ECRP insoluble fibers were less utilized than CRP insoluble fibers in TIM- 2 leading to an overall lower fiber utilization and SCFA production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Chicory (Cichorium intybus) is a {{plant that}} is cultured in some area of Iran, {{including}} Khozestan. All of parts of the chicory especially its leave and root have medicinal properties. It is traditionally used for treatment icterus, renal failure, gout and arthritis in human. Important side effects were not reported from this plant. Excretion substances like uric acid are clinically important in some pathological conditions such as urecemia and icterus in horse. However the pharmacological effect of chicory was not evaluated in horses. The present study was conducted for evaluation effect of leave of chicory on changes of factors related to liver function in serum of horse. In this study, 8 Arabian horses were selected. They had 10 - 20 years and were clinically in normal conditions. The horses were fed routine diet. The <b>dried</b> leave of <b>chicory</b> was daily added to food of horses at 0. 5 g/kg for 15 days.

40|$|Two diets with {{contrasting}} fermentability were formulated. Diet 1 containing resistant carbohydrates {{was based}} on triticale, barley, rapeseed cake as the main ingredients supplemented with grass clover silage. Diet 2 containing fermentable carbohydrates {{was based on}} triticale, barley, blue lupines and <b>dried</b> grinded <b>chicory</b> roots. The two diets were fed to seventy-two pigs tested negative for T. suis and swine dysentery were divided into 8 groups (A-H) according to weight and sex as follows: Group A: Diet 1, T. suis and B. hyodysenteriae; Group B: Diet 2, T. suis and B. hyodysenteriae, Group C: Diet 1, B. hyodysenteriae; Group D: Diet 2, B. hyodysenteriae, Group E: Diet 1, T. suis; Group F: Diet 2, T. suis; Group G: Diet 1, control, and Group H: Diet 2, control. The pigs were fed according to weight once a day. After two weeks of diet adaptation, pigs in group A, B, E, and F inoculated with 2000 infective T. suis eggs each and pigs in group A, B, C, and D were challenged with 1 x 109 colony-forming units of B. hyodysenteriae each on three consecutive days. Group G and H were uninfected control groups. The pigs were weighed every other week and monitored daily for clinical symptoms. Faecal samples were collected twice a week to monitor the cause of dysentery. The faecal samples were cultured selectively {{for the presence of}} B. hyodysenteriae as well as scored according to consistency (normal, loose, watery/mucoid, and bloody diarrhoea), which was utilized as a measure of clinical disease. All pigs were slaughtered 6 weeks post infection (p. i.) over a course of 5 days. At slaughter a faecal sample was collected for examination of T. suis eggs and a macroscopic pathological examination was performed on each pig. Tissue samples were taken from the anterior part of the colon for histopathological examinations. The large intestine was divided into caecum and 5 colon sections. The sections were emptied and weighed and pH was measured in the contents of each section. Samples were taken from the contents for chemical analyses. The remaining contents were used for recovery of T. suis. T. suis were not found at slaughter and no B. hyodysenteriae were isolated from any of the control pigs in group G and H. No clinical signs of dysentery were found in pigs experimentally challenged with B. hyodysenteriae that were receiving Diet 2 (Group B and D). Likewise, no bacteria were isolated from faeces in any of these pigs. In contrast, clinical symptoms of dysentery were observed in all experimentally B. hyodysenteriae pigs fed Diet 1 (Group A and C, except 1 pig in Group A) and similarly the bacteria were found in faeces of all these pigs at different times during the experiment starting from 6 days p. c. There was no difference in worm counts between any of the T. suis infected groups (Group A, B, E, and F). The lowest worm burdens, however, were found in the pigs fed Diet 2 (Group B and F). The frequency of swine dysentery was lower in pigs with dual infections, but consistent throughout the course of the study. Pigs only infected with B. hyodysenteriae, on the other hand, had higher frequency of clinical symptoms, but only over a period of 2 weeks from 9 days to 23 days p. c. The weight gain did not differ significantly between the groups, but was lowest in pigs with clinical swine dysentery (Group A and C). Diet 2 prevented completely the occurrence of swine dysentery in both experimentally infected groups (A and C) presumably because of rapid fermentation of non-digestible carbohydrates constituents; galactans from lupins and fructans from chicory...|$|R

Foram realizadas colheitas aos 52 dias após o semeio e aos 35 dias após a primeira colheita. Na rúcula e no almeirão, respectivamente, a altura de plantas (26, 54 e 24, 99 cm), o número de folhas por planta (23, 4 e 16, 40), o comprimento (18, 62 e 24, 68 cm) e a área de uma folha (66, 73 e 177, 0 cm²) não foram influenciados significativamente pelo número de linhas nem pelo consórcio, mas foram maiores na primeira, em relação à segunda colheita. O comprimento da folha de almeirão foi influenciado significativamente pela interação tipo de cultivo e número de linhas por canteiro, com variação de 22, 74 cm no R 4 até 26, 78 cm no R 3 A 4. A produção de massa fresca (15, 66 e 11, 62 t ha- 1) e seca (1, 33 e 1, 00 t ha- 1) de rúcula foram significativamente diferentes sob quatro e três linhas de plantas, respectivamente. No almeirão, as matérias fresca e seca foram, respectivamente, de 12, 55 e 0, 85 t ha- 1 no A 3; 15, 60 e 1, 13 t ha- 1 no A 4; 17, 44 e 1, 26 t ha- 1 no cultivo solteiro e 10, 72 e 0, 72 t ha- 1 no consórcio. A razão de área equivalente (RAE), para a primeira e segunda colheita, foi de 1, 87 e 1, 76 para R 3 A 4 e 1, 56 e 1, 58 para R 4 A 3, respectivamente. O arranjo R 4 A 3 poderia ter gerado incrementos monetários por hectare de R$ 28. 279, 80 e de R$ 20. 065, 95 na primeira colheita e R$ 18. 703, 35 e de R$ 17. 283, 60 na segunda colheita, em relação ao almeirão e a rúcula solteira. A melhor renda bruta na segunda colheita foi no tratamento R 4 A 3, correspondendo a 84, 27 % da melhor renda bruta obtida na primeira colheita, no mesmo tratamento, em ciclo vegetativo 17 dias menor. The {{work was}} carried out in Dourados MS, with the objective of evaluating yield and gross income in mono-cropping and inter-cropping system. Mono-croppings of 'Cultivada' roquette-R and 'Amarelo' chicory-A, in three rows (A 3) and four (A 4) rows and R 3 A 4 and R 4 A 3 intercropping systems were studied in randomized block design, with five replications. Harvests were done at 52 days after sowing and at 35 days after the first harvest. For roquette and chicory, respectively, plant heights (26. 54 and 24. 99 cm), number of leaves per plant (23. 4 and 16. 40), length (18. 62 and 24. 68 cm) and area of one leaf (66. 73 and 177. 0 cm²) were not influenced by number of rows, neither by intercropping system, but results were greater for the first harvest than the second. Length of chicory leaf was significantly influenced by intercropped system and number of rows interaction, which ranged from 22. 74 (R 4) up to 26. 78 cm (R 3 A 4). Yield of fresh (15. 66 and 11. 62 t ha- 1) and dried (1. 33 and 1. 00 t ha- 1) mass of roquette under four and three rows were significantly different, respectively.
