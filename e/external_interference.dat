It can either be implemented as channel adaption where a fixed frequency channel is assigned at a given time or channel hopping where the channel to be used is iterated over a given sequence.

30|$|In MBSFNs, the {{interference}} consists of both <b>external</b> <b>interferences</b> and self-interference from the own network. Signals received within the OFDM symbol guard interval are considered as useful and contribute totally to the useful signal, whereas signals {{with a time}} delay greater than the guard interval cause self-interference. In practice, signals arriving with a delay slightly greater than the guard interval contribute partially to the useful signal and partially to the self-interference. In {{order to determine the}} ratio between the useful and interfering contribution, in this article the weighting function defined in[28] was used. On the other hand, <b>external</b> <b>interferences</b> come from the cells surrounding the MBSFN area.

40|$|<b>External</b> <b>interferences</b> can {{severely}} {{degrade the}} performance of an Over-the-horizon radar (OTHR), so suppression of <b>external</b> <b>interferences</b> in strong clutter environment is the prerequisite for the target detection. The traditional suppression solutions usually began with clutter suppression in either time or frequency domain, followed by the interference detection and suppression. Based on this traditional solution, this paper proposes a method characterized by joint clutter suppression and interference detection: by analyzing eigenvalues in a short-time moving window centered at different time position, Clutter is suppressed by discarding the maximum three eigenvalues at every time position and meanwhile detection is achieved by analyzing the remained eigenvalues at different position. Then, restoration is achieved by forward-backward linear prediction using interference-free data surrounding the interference position. In the numeric computation, the eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) is replaced by values decomposition (SVD) based on the equivalence of these two processing.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for the {{identification}} of different partial discharges (PDs) sources through the analysis {{of a collection of}} PD signals acquired with a PD measurement system. This method, robust and sensitive enough to cope with noisy data and <b>external</b> <b>interferences,</b> combines the characterization of each signal from the collection, with a clustering procedure, the CLARA algorithm. Several features are proposed for the characterization of the signals, being the wavelet variances, the frequency estimated with the Prony method, and the energy, the most relevant for the performance of the clustering procedure. The result of the unsupervised classification is a set of clusters each containing those signals which are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. The analysis of the classification results permits both the identification of different PD sources and the discrimination between original PD signals, reflections, noise and <b>external</b> <b>interferences.</b> The methods and graphical tools detailed in this paper have been coded and published as a contributed package of the R environment under a GNU/GPL license...|$|R

Colour was lent to this belief because the conservative element which had opposed social reforms was loudest in its demand for intervention. The wealthy and travelled classes organized preparedness parades and distributed propaganda. In short, those who had apparently done their utmost to oppose democracy at home were most insistent that we should embark upon a war for democracy across the seas. Again, what kind of democracy?

60|$|In {{the sense}} in which we are {{speaking}} of it, liberty is not a positive force, any more than the smoothness of a railroad is a positive force.[33] It is a condition. As a force, there is a sense in which it is true to call liberty a negation. As a condition, though it may still be a negation, yet it may be indispensable for the production of certain positive results. The vacuity of an exhausted receiver is not a force, but it is the indispensable condition of certain positive operations. Liberty as a force may be as impotent as its opponents allege. This does not affect its value as a preliminary or accompanying condition. The absence of a strait-waistcoat is a negation; but it is a useful condition for the activity of sane men. No doubt there must be a definite limit to this absence of <b>external</b> <b>interference</b> with conduct, and that limit will be fixed at various points by different thinkers. We are now only urging that it cannot be wisely fixed for the more complex societies by any one who has not grasped this fundamental preconception, that liberty, or the absence of coercion, or the leaving people to think, speak, and act as they please, is in itself a good thing. It is the object of a favourable presumption. The burden of proving it inexpedient always lies, and wholly lies, on those who wish to abridge it by coercion, whether direct or indirect.|$|E
