30|$|In {{order to}} utilize the {{obtained}} data in a useful manner, simple <b>fits</b> <b>were</b> developed for each fluid. These <b>fits</b> <b>are</b> obtained in a piece wise manner with the inclination effect modeled first, followed by the effects of variable gas flow rate. The two <b>fits</b> <b>were</b> combined to obtain a simple model for predicting the dynamic gas kill liquid flow velocity {{as a function of}} inclination angle and actual gas flow velocity.|$|R
40|$|New, {{improved}} curve fits for the {{thermodynamic properties}} of equilibrium air have been developed. The curve <b>fits</b> <b>are</b> for pressure, speed of sound, temperature, entropy, enthalpy, density, and internal energy. These curve <b>fits</b> can <b>be</b> readily incorporated into new or existing {{computational fluid dynamics}} codes if real gas effects are desired. The curve <b>fits</b> <b>are</b> constructed from Grabau-type transition functions to model the thermodynamic surfaces in a piecewise manner. The accuracies and continuity of these curve <b>fits</b> <b>are</b> substantially improved over those of previous curve <b>fits.</b> These improvements <b>are</b> due to the incorporation of {{a small number of}} additional terms in the approximating polynomials and careful choices of the transition functions. The ranges of validity of the new curve <b>fits</b> <b>are</b> temperatures up to 25 000 K and densities from 10 to the - 7 to 10 to the 3 d power amagats...|$|R

40|$|Simplified curve fits for the {{thermodynamic}} properties of equilibrium air were devised {{for use in}} either the time-dependent or shock-capturing computational methods. For the time-dependent method, curve <b>fits</b> <b>were</b> developed for p = p(e, rho), a = a(e, rho), and T = T(e, rho). For the shock-capturing method, curve <b>fits</b> <b>were</b> developed for h = h(p, rho) and T = T(p, rho). The ranges of validity for these curves <b>fits</b> <b>were</b> for temperatures up to 25, 000 K and densities from 10 to the minus 7 th power to 10 to the 3 d power amagats. These approximate curve <b>fits</b> <b>are</b> considered particularly useful when employed on advanced computers such as the Burroughs ILLIAC 4 or the CDC STAR...|$|R
30|$|It {{can be seen}} in Table  1 {{that the}} SSE and RMSE of the {{exponential}} <b>fit</b> <b>are</b> smaller than the linear fit, and meanwhile the CD and R of the exponential <b>fit</b> <b>are</b> larger. Therefore, the oscillation is judged to be a WDO.|$|R
5000|$|Force <b>fits</b> <b>are</b> {{designed}} {{to maintain a}} controlled pressure between mating parts, and are used where forces or torques are being transmitted through the joining point.

25|$|R-squared is the {{coefficient}} of determination indicating goodness-of-fit of the regression. This statistic will be equal to one if <b>fit</b> <b>is</b> perfect, and to zero when regressors X have no explanatory power whatsoever. This is a biased estimate of the population R-squared, and will never decrease if additional regressors are added, {{even if they are}} irrelevant.|$|E
25|$|Invisible in canal {{hearing aids}} (IIC) style of hearing aids fits inside {{the ear canal}} completely, leaving little to no trace of an {{installed}} hearing aid visible. This is because it fits deeper in the canal than other types, {{so that it is}} out of view even when looking directly into the ear bowl (concha). A comfortable <b>fit</b> <b>is</b> achieved because the shell of the aid is custom-made to the individual ear canal after taking a mould.|$|E
25|$|Reliability for {{capacitors}} {{is usually}} specified in numbers of Failures In Time (FIT) {{during the period}} of constant random failures. <b>FIT</b> <b>is</b> the number of failures that can be expected in one billion (109) component-hours of operation at fixed working conditions (e.g. 1000 devices for 1 million hours, or 1 million devices for 1000 hours each, at 40°C and 0.5 UR). For other conditions of applied voltage, current load, temperature, mechanical influences and humidity the FIT can recalculated with terms standardized for industrial or military contexts.|$|E
40|$|Vector <b>Fitting</b> <b>is</b> an {{effective}} technique for rational approximation of LTI systems. It has <b>been</b> extended to <b>fit</b> {{the magnitude of}} the transfer function in absence of phase data. In this paper, magnitude Vector <b>Fitting</b> <b>is</b> modified to work on inequalities which {{the magnitude of the}} transfer function has to satisfy, instead of least squares approximation. The new interval version of the magnitude Vector <b>Fitting</b> <b>is</b> proved valuable for multiband filter design and the fitting of noisy magnitude spectra. © 2009 IMACS.

40|$|New {{improved}} curve fits for the {{thermodynamic properties}} of equilibrium air were developed. The curve <b>fits</b> <b>are</b> for p = p(e,rho), a = a(e,rho), T = T(e,rho), s = s(e,rho), T = T(p,rho), h = h(p,rho), rho = rho(p,s), e = e(p,s) and a = a(p,s). These curve <b>fits</b> can <b>be</b> readily incorporated into new or existing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes if real-gas effects are desired. The curve <b>fits</b> <b>were</b> constructed using Grabau-type transition functions {{to model the}} thermodynamic surfaces in a piecewise manner. The accuracies and continuity of these curve <b>fits</b> <b>are</b> substantially improved over those of previous curve fits appearing in NASA CR- 2470. These improvements were due to the incorporation of {{a small number of}} additional terms in the approximating polynomials and careful choices of the transition functions.

25|$|One {{thing to}} note {{is that in}} the PRSV equation, the {{parameter}} <b>fit</b> <b>is</b> done in a particular temperature range which is usually below the critical temperature. Above the critical temperature, the PRSV alpha function tends to diverge and become arbitrarily large instead of tending towards 0. Because of this, alternate equations for alpha should be employed above the critical point. This is especially important for systems containing hydrogen which is often found at temperatures far above its critical point. Several alternate formulations have been proposed. Some well known ones are by Twu et all or by Mathias and Copeman.|$|E
25|$|Lick <b>fit</b> <b>is</b> {{the frantic}} licking to which Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs can be prone. This has been {{reported}} in 17% of the breed. When {{in the middle of a}} lick fit, the dog will lick anything they can — carpet, floors, walls — and will eat anything they can find, including grass, leaves, dirt, carpet, and will gulp air and swallow constantly. Their actions make it obvious they are in severe gastrointestinal discomfort. Many owners are able to prevent lick fits by ensuring the dog never has an empty stomach by frequent, smaller meals and large dog biscuits as between meal snacks.|$|E
25|$|The {{methods of}} {{clearing}} differ between the half mask, which covers {{the eyes and}} nose, and the full-face mask, which also covers the mouth. If the mask has a purge valve and the strap tension is correct, the diver holds the head so that the valve is at the lowest point and exhales through the nose. If the mask is a good fit on the diver's face and the strap is correctly placed, exhaling through the nose will usually drive water out along the bottom edge of the skirt. It {{may be necessary to}} press {{the upper part of the}} mask against the face to improve the seal if the diver is rolled to one side. If the <b>fit</b> <b>is</b> not perfect, or the strap is too low, contact pressure of the top edge against the forehead may be insufficient to maintain a seal when the head is upright.|$|E

500|$|The pistols {{used are}} gas-driven with a caliber of 4.5mm (.177 in). The minimum trigger pull weight is 500gram (17.6oz), {{half that of}} a sport pistol, and the grip {{restrictions}} are similar to sport pistols, but the box in which the pistol must <b>fit</b> <b>is</b> much larger: 42 by 20 by 5cm (17 by 8 by 2 in).

The maximum overall weight is [...] The pistol must be operated by only one hand from a standing position, and may only be loaded with one pellet at a time.|$|E
