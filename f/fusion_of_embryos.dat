Here, we document {{for the first time}} that the embryos of the broadcast spawning coral Platygyra daedalea could fuse during blastulation and further develop into conjoined larvae, and the settlement of conjoined larvae immediately resulted in inborn juvenile colonies. <b>Fusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> might be an adaptive strategy to form pre-metamorphic chimeric larvae and larger recruits, thereby promoting early survival.

40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{reported}} suggesting that under conditions where an allogeneic effect could not be demonstrated, primed histoincompatible T and B cells did not cooperate in a humoral immune response (1, 2). By contrast semiallogeneic T and B cells were found to cooperate. The authors therefore concluded {{that in order to}} obtain efficient T-B collaboration the cells concerned must share determinants coded for by the H- 2 -gene complex, most likely the I region (3). In different experiments Bechthol et al.

On the basis of these findings some authors maintain that in chimeras tolerance is due to the absence or reactive cell clones whereas others postulate that tolerance is a manifestation of an active immune response leading to the production of blocking serum factors (9 - 11) or suppressor cells (13).

40|$|Abstract Background Extracellular matrix {{metalloproteinase}} inducer (EMMPRIN) regulates several biological functions {{involving the}} modulation of cell behaviors via cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. According to its diverse functions, {{we hypothesized that}} EMMPRIN may {{play an important role}} in endometrial remodeling and establishment of pregnancy in cow. Methods In this study, endometrial tissues from the cyclic cows during before ovulation, after ovulation and middle of estrous cycle; and pregnant endometrial tissues from Day 19 to 35 of gestation have been used. Expression of mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR, qPCR and in situ hybridization whereas protein expression by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Results EMMPRIN mRNA was expressed in both cyclic and pregnant endometrium and significantly higher in the endometrium at Day 35 of gestation than the cyclic endometrium. In Western blot analysis, an approximately 65 kDa band was detected in the endometrium, and approximately 51 kDa in the cultured bovine epithelial cells and BT- 1 cells, respectively. Both in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry data showed that EMMPRIN was primarily expressed in luminal and glandular epithelium with strong staining on Day 19 conceptus. At Day 19 of gestation, expression of EMMPRIN mRNA on luminal epithelium was decreased than that observed at middle of estrous cycle, however, on Day 30 of gestation, slightly increased expression was found at the site of placentation. Expression of matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP- 2) and MMP- 14 mRNA were mainly detected in stroma and their expression also decreased at Day 19 of gestation however it was also expressed at the site of placentation at Day 30 of gestation as observed for EMMPRIN. Expression of MMP- 1 or - 9 mRNA was very low and was below the detection limit in the cyclic and pregnant endometrium. Conclusion EMMPRIN from the luminal epithelium may regulate the expression of stromal MMP- 2 and - 14 suggesting its crucial role in adhesion and <b>fusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>embryo</b> to luminal epithelium by directly itself through physiological tissues remodeling and developmental process, and/or stimulating MMPs to compensate endometrial functions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Multinucleated myotubes develop by the {{sequential}} <b>fusion</b> <b>of</b> individual myoblasts. Using {{a convergence}} of genomic and classical genetic approaches, we have discovered a novel gene, singles bar (sing), that is essential for myoblast fusion. sing encodes a small multipass transmembrane protein containing a MARVEL domain, which is found in vertebrate proteins involved in processes such as tight junction formation and vesicle trafficking where-as in myoblast fusion-membrane apposition occurs. sing is expressed in both founder cells and fusion competent myoblasts, preceding and during myoblast <b>fusion.</b> Examination <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> injected with double-stranded sing RNA or embryos homozygous for ethane methyl sulfonate-induced sing alleles revealed an identical phenotype: replacement of multinucleated myofibers by groups of single, myosin-expressing myoblasts at a stage when formation of the mature muscle pattern is complete in wild-type embryos. Unfused sing mutant myoblasts form clusters, suggesting that early recognition and adhesion of these cells are unimpaired. To further investigate this phenotype, we undertook electron microscopic ultrastructural studies of fusing myoblasts in both sing and wild-type embryos. These experiments revealed that more sing mutant myoblasts than wild-type contain pre-fusion complexes, which are characterized by electron-dense vesicles paired {{on either side of}} the fusing plasma membranes. In contrast, embryos mutant for another muscle fusion gene, blown fuse (blow), have a normal number of such complexes. Together, these results lead to the hypothesis that sing acts at a step distinct from that of blow, and that sing is required on both founder cell and fusion-competent myoblast membranes to allow progression past the pre-fusion complex stage <b>of</b> myoblast <b>fusion,</b> possibly by mediating <b>fusion</b> <b>of</b> the electron-dense vesicles to the plasma membrane...|$|R

50|$|The {{human embryo}} begins life with two ducts in the pancreas, the ventral duct and the dorsal duct.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the microtubule distribution following control of nuclear remodeling by treatment of bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos with caffeine or roscovitine. Bovine somatic cells were fused to enucleated oocytes treated with either 5 mM caffeine or 150 µM roscovitine to control the type of nuclear remodeling. The proportion <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> that underwent premature chromosome condensation (PCC) was increased by caffeine treatment but was reduced by roscovitine treatment (p < 0. 05). The microtubule organization was examined by immunostaining β- and γ-tubulins at 15 min, 3 h, and 20 h <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> using laser scanning confocal microscopy. The γ-tubulin foci inherited from the donor centrosome were observed in most <b>of</b> the SCNT <b>embryos</b> at 15 min <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> (91. 3 %) and most of them did not disappear until 3 h after <b>fusion,</b> regardless <b>of</b> treatment (82. 9 - 87. 2 %).

40|$|Chimerism {{is defined}} as the {{presence}} in a subject of more than one stable and genetically distinct cell line; cases reported so far include both patients with ambiguous genitalia and healthy subjects. The biological mechanisms, which may give origin to chimeras, are complex, and can be understood by analyzing DNA samples of the patients and their parents using molecular techniques. The objective {{of this study is to}} identify the mechanism of origin for the 2 cases we report. The first patient is a phenotipically normal girl with normal (external and internal) genitalia; the second patient had ambiguous genitalia and underwent surgery. DNA was purified from blood samples and, limited to Patient 1, from a sample of biliary cyst. Short tandem repeat polymorphisms were analyzed in order to identify the relative parental contribution to the patients. Molecular analyses carried out on the first patient are not fully informative because of two possible explanations (i. e. parthenogenetic and andrognetic chimera), while in the second case the presence of four alleles at some markers allowed us to identify a tetragametic chimera originnated from the <b>fusion</b> <b>of</b> two distinct <b>embryos.</b> Studies carried on one single tissue may not always be conclusive as they do not allow the precise identification of the mechanism of origin.

40|$|The {{developmental}} stages <b>of</b> the maize <b>embryo</b> sac {{were correlated}} with the corresponding silk lengths of ear florets in the female inflorescence. The development <b>of</b> <b>embryo</b> sacs in the ovules of spikes occurs in a gradient pattern with the initiation <b>of</b> the <b>embryo</b> sac beginning {{at the base of}} the ear and progressing to the top. At the beginning of meiosis, the presence of conspicuous cortical microtubules coincides with the extensive elongation of the megasporocyte.

40|$|Fertilization {{involves}} {{a series of}} cellular interactions culminating in the <b>fusion</b> <b>of</b> gamete membranes, creating a zygote and then an embryo. During the process of human fertilization in vivo or in conventional in vitro fertilization (IVF), sperm must be capable of undergoing the acrosome reaction, binding to the zona pellucida (ZP), and penetrating the ZP to fuse with the oolema. The key role in this process is played by fertilin beta. Protamines and histones are the proteins that bind to sperm chromatin and contribute in chromatin remodeling during early spermiogenesis. It {{has been suggested that}} these proteins may also participate in successful fertilization and embryo development. Using reverse transcription and real-time quantitative PCR reaction (QR-PCR) methods and zygote and embryo scoring, we compared fertilin beta, protamine 1 (PRM 1), protamine 2 (PRM 2), spermatid-specific linker histone 1 (HILS 1) mRNAs levels, in vitro fertilization ability of mature spermatozoa, and quality <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> obtained from in vitro fertilization (IVF).

To test this hypothesis, during embryonic masculine differentiation in mice of the B 10. A strain, we administered certain agents that produce blockade of masculinization. We report that arachidonic acid can reverse the inhibition of masculine development in male embryos produced by estradiol- 17 beta or by cyproterone acetate, an androgen receptor-site blocker, and that such reversal can be prevented by an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, such as indomethacin. We have also found that agents that block the arachidonic acid cascade at the level of phospholipase A 2 (cortisone, phenytoin) or at the level of cyclooxygenase (indomethacin, aspirin) also block masculine differentiation and that such antimasculinization is reversed by arachidonic acid. The masculinization <b>of</b> male <b>embryos</b> is inhibited by indomethacin and aspirin, and the masculinization <b>of</b> female <b>embryos</b> produced by exogenous testosterone is prevented by indomethacin.

40|$|SummaryIn vertebrates, the {{morphogenetic}} {{assembly of}} the primitive heart tube requires the medial migration and midline <b>fusion</b> <b>of</b> the bilateral myocardial epithelia [1, 2].

In a forward genetic screen to identify genes regulating early zebrafish heart development, we identified a mutation in the 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase 1 b (hmgcr 1 b) gene that affects myocardial migration to the midline and subsequent heart-tube morphogenesis. The mutant phenotype can be rescued with injections of mevalonate, the direct product of HMGCR activity. Furthermore, treatment <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> with pharmacological inhibitors of isoprenoid synthesis, which occurs downstream of mevalonate production, resulted in defective heart-tube formation. Interestingly, in hmgcr 1 b mutant embryos and embryos treated with HMGCR inhibitors, both RasCT 20 -eGFP and RhoaCT 32 -eGFP fusion proteins were mislocalized away from the plasma membrane in embryonic myocardial cells.

PMSG and 500 I. U. hCG 72 h later. After 17 days, 1500 I. U. PMSG followed by 1000 I. U. hCG was administered. Five days after insemination embryos were recovered and cultured for 6 days. Both single and double hormonal stimulation schedules resulted in recovery of elevated numbers <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> (28. 4 and 23. 4 vs. 11. 3; p< 0. 01 and p≤ 0. 05, respectively) with a higher percentage <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> classified as degenerated (39. 2 % and 43. 1 %, respectively) compared to the non-stimulated, control group (5. 1 %). The number <b>of</b> <b>embryos</b> destined for culture did not differ between the single and double synchronized groups. The highest percentage <b>of</b> hatched <b>embryos</b> was observed in the control group. In conclusion, the single synchronization and superovulation schedule is sufficient to obtain high numbers <b>of</b> <b>embryos,</b> however, both synchronization methods resulted in the recovery of considerable numbers <b>of</b> degenerated <b>embryos.</b> A higher number and percentage <b>of</b> hatched <b>embryos</b> after culture was found among embryos from the control group compared to gonadotropin-stimulated gilts.
