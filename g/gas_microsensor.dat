40|$|An oxygen <b>gas</b> <b>microsensor</b> {{based on}} nanostructured sol-gel TiO 2 thin films with a buried Pd layer was {{developed}} on a silicon substrate. The nanostructured titania thin films for O 2 sensors were {{prepared by the}} sol-gel process and became anatase after heat treatment. A sandwich TiO 2 square board with an area of 350 μm × 350 μm was defined by both wet etching and dry etching processes and the wet one was applied in the final process due to its advantages of easy control for the final structure. A pair of 150 nm Pt micro interdigitated electrodes with 50 nm Ti buffer layer was fabricated on the board by a lift-off process. The sensor chip was tested in a furnace with changing the O 2 concentration from 1. 0 % to 20 % by monitoring its electrical resistance. Results showed that after several testing cycles the sensor’s output becomes stable, and its sensitivity is 0. 054 with deviation 2. 65 × 10 − 4 and hysteresis is 8. 5 %.

40|$|Many {{industrial}} and environmental processes, including bioremediation, {{would benefit from}} the feedback and control information provided by a local multi-analyte chemical sensor. For most processes, such a sensor {{would need to be}} rugged enough to be placed in situ for long-term remote monitoring, and inexpensive enough to be fielded in useful numbers. The multi-analyte capability is difficult to obtain from common passive sensors, but can be provided by an active device that produces a spectrum-type response. Such new active <b>gas</b> <b>microsensor</b> technology has been developed at Argonne National Laboratory. The technology couples an electrocatalytic ceramic-metallic (cermet) microsensor with a voltammetric measurement technique and advanced neural signal processing. It has been demonstrated to be flexible, rugged, and very economical to produce and deploy. Both narrow interest detectors and wide spectrum instruments have been developed around this technology. Much of this technology's strength lies in the active measurement technique employed. The technique involves applying voltammetry to a miniature electrocatalytic cell to produce unique chemical ''signatures'' from the analytes. These signatures are processed with neural pattern recognition algorithms to identify and quantify the components in the analyte. The neural signal processing allows for innovative sampling and analysis strategies to be employed with the microsensor. In most situations, the whole response signature from the voltammogram can be used to identify, classify, and quantify an analyte, without dissecting it into component parts. This allows an instrument to be calibrated once for a specific gas or mixture of gases by simple exposure to a multi-component standard rather than by a series of individual gases. The sampled unknown analytes can vary in composition or in concentration, the calibration, sensing, and processing methods of these active voltammetric microsensors can detect, recognize, and quantify different signatures and support subsequent analyses. The instrument can be trained to recognize and report expected analyte components (within some tolerance), but also can alarm when unexpected components are detected. Unknowns can be repeat-sampled to build a reference library for later post processing and verification...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this contribution, we show new {{results of}} low {{frequencies}} noise characterization of metal oxide <b>gas</b> <b>microsensors</b> with WO 3 sensitive thin film. The spectral {{form of the}} measured noise responses using our specific systems is similar for tested gases (ozone and nitrogen dioxide). We observe a clear lorentzian behavior according to adsorption-desorption noise theory. To identify the detected gas, a physical-based characterization model of adsorption-desorption noise source is proposed and compared with the empirical flicker noise model. We show that the excess noise {{is due to the}} adsorption-desorption processes {{on the surface of the}} sensors sensitive film. The lorentzian parameters depend on the nature of gas and the noise level dependence with gas concentration is clearly demonstrated. This confirms the interest of noise spectroscopy to improve the selectivity of gas sensors...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePublic {{authorities}} are implementing increasingly restrictive standards and regulations regarding pollution emissions {{due to the}} concern of health issues related to air pollution. In order {{to determine whether they}} are applicable, it is necessary to be able to quantify emissions exactly, taking into account a threshold tolerance for certain gases of the order of one part per billion (ppb). There is therefore an increasing demand in the development of pollution control systems that are both more selective and more sensitive. Besides pollution control, the detection of harmful and explosive compounds is undergoing considerable development. This is in part explained by the current climate of permanent insecurity arising from terrorist threats. In addition to this, the challenge presented by miniaturization constitutes a significant advantage, not only for the attractiveness of these devices for on-site analysis, but also for their low energy consumption and the ease with which they can be integrated into other detection devices, thus broadening their field of application. Their miniaturization may also favor the multiplication of measurement points owing to their offered spatio-temporal analyses. Over the last two decades, a number of miniaturized systems have been developed to detect low gas concentrations, for example, microchromatographs (µ-GC), ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) and electronic noises (E-noise), which use a network of <b>gas</b> <b>microsensors.</b> The preconditioning of the gas is usually of high importance for these miniaturized devices. On the one hand it involves modifying the gas mixture, for example, to improve the selectivity of the detection device (the case of <b>gas</b> <b>microsensors)</b> and, on the other hand, the effect of preconcentrating in order to increase the detection system's sensitivity. It is sometimes possible that the concentration of the gas needing detection is so low that it is below the detection limit of the sensors usually used. In this case it is necessary to provide a preconcentrating unit upstream of the sensor. In this chapter, we will introduce the principle of preconcentration before going over some basics of adsorption phenomena and common adsorbing materials. We will then present the current developments of preconcentrators...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{research}} study on application of low-cost solid-state <b>gas</b> <b>microsensors</b> for odour control and air-pollution monitoring in a landfill. The method introduces microsensors based on commercial devices of n-type metal oxides for cost-effective and real-time monitoring. This research provides a comparative study and assessment of the sensor response for odour detection and potential continuous monitoring of methane (CH 4) and Non-Methanic Hydro-Carbons (NMHC) in a landfill. This leads to an insight into low-cost gas sensing capability for practical applications. The environmental measurements have been performed by a sensor-array with multiple sensing elements for high sensitivity and broad selectivity detection. This sensor technology may be useful for the development of a portable, compact, wireless and cost-effective system for gas monitoring applications and industrial process control. The results are discussed as the outcome of an experimental work carried in field at a landfill and demonstrate the efficiency of the low-cost chemo-resistors array for odour sensing and environmental monitoring.

40|$|Nanostructured niobium oxide (NO) {{semiconductors}} {{are gaining}} increasing attention as electronic, optical, and electro-optic materials. However, {{the preparation of}} stable NO nanofilms with reproducible morphology and behavior remains a challenge. Here we show a rapid, well-controlled, and efficient way to synthesize NO films with self-organized columnlike nanostructured morphologies and advanced functional properties. The films are developed via {{the growth of a}} nanoporous anodic alumina layer, followed by the pore-directed anodization of the Nb underlayer. The columns may grow 30 - 150 nm wide, up to 900 nm long, with an aspect ratio of up to 20, being anchored to a thin continuous oxide layer that separates the columns from the substrate. The as-anodized films have a graded chemical composition changing from amorphous Nb 2 O 5 mixed with Al 2 O 3, Si-, and P-containing species in the surface region to NbO 2 in the lower film layer. The post-anodization treatments result in the controlled formation of Nb 2 O 5, NbO 2, and NbO crystal phases, accompanied by transformation from nearly perfect dielectric to n-type semiconductor behavior of the films. The approach allows for the smooth film growth without early dielectric breakdown, stress-generated defects, or destructive dissolution at the respective interfaces, which is a unique situation in the oxide films on niobium. The functional properties of the NO films, revealed to date, allow for potential applications as nanocomposite capacitor dielectrics and active layers for semiconductor <b>gas</b> <b>microsensors</b> with the sensitivity to ethanol and the response to hydrogen being among best ever reported...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{combination}} of process rate determination, microsensor profiling and molecular techniques, we demonstrated that denitrification, and not anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), is the major nitrogen loss process in biological soil crusts from Oman. Potential denitrification rates were 584 ± 101 and 58 ± 20 ??mol N?m? 2 ?h? 1 for cyanobacterial and lichen crust, respectively. Complete denitrification to N 2 was further confirmed by an 15 NO 3 ? tracer experiment with intact crust pieces that proceeded at rates of 103 ± 19 and 27 ± 8 ??mol N?m? 2 ?h? 1 for cyanobacterial and lichen crust, respectively. Strikingly, N 2 O gas was emitted at very high potential rates of 387 ± 143 and 31 ± 6 ??mol N?m? 2 ?h? 1 from the cyanobacterial and lichen crust, respectively, with N 2 O accounting for 53 – 66 % of the total emission of nitrogenous <b>gases.</b> <b>Microsensor</b> measurements revealed that N 2 O was produced in the anoxic layer and thus apparently originated from incomplete denitrification. Using quantitative PCR, denitrification genes were detected in both the crusts and were expressed either in comparable (nirS) or slightly higher (narG) numbers in the cyanobacterial crusts. Although 99 % of the nirS sequences in the cyanobacterial crust were affiliated to an uncultured denitrifying bacterium, 94 % of these sequences were most closely affiliated to Paracoccus denitrificans in the lichen crust. Sequences of nosZ gene formed a distinct cluster that did not branch with known denitrifying bacteria. Our results demonstrate that nitrogen loss via denitrification is a dominant process in crusts from Oman, which leads to N 2 O gas emission and potentially reduces desert soil fertility...|$|R

Collecting massively distributed information requires {{the use of}} high-performance communication systems as well as sensors with very small ecological footprint. Because of their high sensitivity, the wide range of their observables, their energetic self-sufficiency and their low cost, micro- and nano- sensors are particularly well suited to urban metrology. A 8 years, 9 MC equipment project funded by the French 'Programme d'Investissement d'Avenir' starting in 2012, the Sense-City project will offer a suite of high-quality facilities for the design, prototyping and performance assessment of micro- and nanosensors devoted to sustainable urbanization. The scientific program of Sense-City is built around four programs, environmental monitoring, structural health monitoring, energy performances monitoring and people health and exposure monitoring. We present the activities of the consortium partners, IFSTTAR, ESIEE-Paris, CSTB, LPICM, and the prospects brought by Sense-City equipment in terms of sensor prototyping, benchmarking and operation validation. We discuss how the various sensors developed by LPICM and ESIEE (for instance conformable chemical and <b>gas</b> <b>microsensors</b> using nanomaterials at LPICM, miniaturized gas chromatographs or microfluidic lab-on-chip for particles analysis at ESIEE-Paris) can be integrated by IFSTTAR into sensors networks tested by IFSTTAR and CSTB in both lab and urban settings. The massively distributed data are interpreted using advanced physical models and inverse methods in order to monitor water, air or soil quality, infrastructure and network safety, building energy performances as well as people health and exposure. We discuss the shortcomings of evaluating the performances of sensors only in lab conditions or directly in real, urban conditions. As a solution, Sense-City will provide an environment of intermediate complexity for the testing of environmental sensors, a realistic urban test space in climatic conditions, both far more complex than clean rooms and far more controllable than actual cities...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTin oxide {{nanorods}} (NRs) are vapour synthesised {{at relatively}} lower temperatures than previously reported {{and without the}} need for substrate pre-treatment, via a vapour-solid mechanism enabled using an aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition method. Results demonstrate that the growth of SnO 2 NRs is promoted by a compression of the nucleation rate parallel to the substrate and a decrease of the energy barrier for growth perpendicular to the substrate, which are controlled via the deposition conditions. This method provides both single-step formation of the SnO 2 NRs and their integration with silicon micromachined platforms, but also allows for in-situ functionalization of the NRs with gold nanoparticles via co-deposition with a gold precursor.

The multidisciplinary project investigated {{scientific and technical}} concepts critical for developing tunable, MEMS-based, <b>gas</b> and vapor <b>microsensors</b> that could be applied for monitoring the types of multiple analytes (and differing backgrounds) encountered at DoE waste sites.

40|$|Waste {{characterization}} {{is probably}} the most costly part of radioactive waste management. An important part of this characterization is the measurements of headspace gas in waste containers in order to demonstrate the compliance with Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) or transportation requirements. The traditional chemical analysis methods, which include all steps of gas sampling, sample shipment and laboratory analysis, are expensive and time-consuming as well as increasing worker's exposure to hazardous environments. Therefore, an alternative technique that can provide quick, in-situ, and real-time detections of headspace gas compositions is highly desirable. This report summarizes the results obtained from a Laboratory Directed Research & Development (LDRD) project entitled 'Potential Application of Microsensor Technology in Radioactive Waste Management with Emphasis on Headspace Gas Detection'. The objective of this project is to bridge the technical gap between the current status of microsensor development and the intended applications of these sensors in nuclear waste management. The major results are summarized below: {sm_bullet} A literature review was conducted on the regulatory requirements for headspace gas sampling/analysis in waste characterization and monitoring. The most relevant gaseous species and the related physiochemical environments were identified. It was found that preconcentrators might be needed in order for chemiresistor sensors to meet desired detection {sm_bullet} A long-term stability test was conducted for a polymer-based chemresistor sensor array. Significant drifts were observed over the time duration of one month. Such drifts should be taken into account for long-term in-situ monitoring. {sm_bullet} Several techniques were explored to improve the performance of sensor polymers. It has been demonstrated that freeze deposition of black carbon (CB) -polymer composite can effectively eliminate the so-called 'coffee ring' effect and lead to a desirable uniform distribution of CB particles in sensing polymer films. The optimal ratio of CB/polymer has been determined. UV irradiation has been shown to improve sensor sensitivity. {sm_bullet} From a large set of commercially available polymers, five polymers were selected to form a sensor array that was able to provide optimal responses to six target-volatile organic compounds (VOCs). A series of tests on the response of sensor array to various VOC concentrations have been performed. Linear sensor responses have been observed over the tested concentration ranges, although the responses over a whole concentration range are generally nonlinear. {sm_bullet} Inverse models have been developed for identifying individual VOCs based on sensor array responses. A linear solvation energy model is particularly promising for identifying an unknown VOC in a single-component system. It has been demonstrated that a sensor array as such we developed is able to discriminate waste containers for their total VOC concentrations and therefore can be used as screening tool for reducing the existing headspace gas sampling rate. {sm_bullet} Various VOC preconcentrators have been fabricated using Carboxen 1000 as an absorbent. Extensive tests have been conducted in order to obtain optimal configurations and parameter ranges for preconcentrator performance. It has been shown that use of preconcentrators can reduce the detection limits of chemiresistors by two orders of magnitude. The life span of preconcentrators under various physiochemical conditions has also been evaluated. {sm_bullet} The performance of Pd film-based H 2 sensors in the presence of VOCs has been evaluated. The interference of sensor readings by VOC has been observed, which {{can be attributed to the}} interference of VOC with the H 2 -O 2 reaction on the Pd alloy surface. This interference can be eliminated by coating a layer of silicon dioxide on sensing film surface. Our work has demonstrated a wide range of applications of <b>gas</b> <b>microsensors</b> in radioactive waste management. Such applications can potentially lead to a significant cost saving and risk reduction for waste characterization...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{liberalization}} of the gas market, more important and frequent fluctuations of the natural gas composition are expected. Owing to this fact, the on-site control of the gas properties will become necessary for end-users. Methane Number is the parameter used to quantify knocking tendency of a gas, parameter especially relevant when natural gas is used as engines fuel. The present paper describes a measurement method to determine the Methane Number of natural gas as well as the microdevices developed to carry out these measurements. The method is based on the measurement of the gas Thermal Conductivity and the existing correlation between this parameter and the Methane Number of natural <b>gas.</b> The developed <b>microsensors</b> are ascribed to Microsystems Technology. They integrate two platinum thermoresistors: a reference one to measure the gas temperature and a sensing one to measure its thermal conductivity. In order to reduce thermal losses to the silicon substrate two different approaches are proposed: a) microbridges to locate the thermoresistors and b) oxidized porous-silicon isolation. In the range of natural gas compositions considered (60 - 100 MN), applying a 50 mA constant current to the sensing thermoresistor, obtained sensitivity is 0. 95 mV/ 1 MN.

40|$|Current gas sensor technology, {{although}} {{meeting the}} minimum requirements in many instances, suffers {{for a number}} of limitations. Hence, there is currently a considerable volume of research being undertaken at many laboratories of different countries. In the past, all chemical sensors and catalyst were optimized empirically by a trial and error method. Today, however, systematic research and development is becoming increasingly important in order to improve sensors and to find new sensing principles. Obtaining a long term stable gas sensor with improved sensitivity, selectivity, and low cost for mass production passes through fundamental research and material characterization to build new chemically sensitive devices or to improve existing ones. The bottom line in the design and manufacture of modern gas sensors is the transfer from ceramic(of Figaro type) to thin film gas sensors(TFGs). This transfer provides new opportunities for further microminiaturization, power consumption and cost reduction of gas sensors. Therefore, at the present time, thin film gas sensors are the basis for the design of the modern <b>gas</b> sensitive multi-parameter <b>microsensor</b> systems. Applications of these systems include environment, security, home systems, smart buildings, transportation, discrete manufacturing, process industries and so on. Microelectromechanical systems(MEMS) based integrated gas sensors present several advantages for these applications such as ease of array fabrication, small size, and unique thermal manipulation capabilities. MEMS based gas sensors; which are usually produced using a standard CMOS(Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) process, have the additional advantages of being readily realized by commercial foundries and amenable to the inclusion of on-chip electronics. In order to speed up the design and optimization of such integrated sensors, microheater designs for gas sensor applications have been presented as first part of the present thesis. As heater design is the key part for a gas sensor operation. So 3 D simulations have been used to optimize micro-heater geometry. The application of MEMS Design Tool(COVENTORWARE) has been presented to the design and analysis of micro-hotplate (MHP) structures. Coupled Electro-thermal analysis provided an estimation of thermal losses and temperature distribution on the hotplate for realistic geometrical and material parameters pertinent to fabrication technology. Five microheater designs have been proposed in terms of different sizes and shapes in order to optimize the microhotplate structure to be used for gas sensor operation for the specified range of temperature and power consumption. To produce a gas sensor, which is able to detect LPG leak, thin films of tin oxide have been developed. FR sputtering has been used to deposit gas sensitive tin oxide thin filmls under various deposition conditions. Four different values of pressure in the range from high pressure(5 X 10 - 2 mbar) to lower pressure (2 X 10 - 3 mbar), three RF power values 50, 75, 100 W and varied oxygen percentage in sputtering atmosphere (0 - 18 %) have been used to optimize the material properties of tin oxide thin films to study the sensitivity towards LPG. All the samples have been analyzed using various macro and microscopic characterization techniques. Extensive studies have been done on the sensor response for the samples deposited under different conditions. Finally the sample film deposited at 5 x 10 - 3 mbar, with applied power of 75 W in the presence of 8 % oxygen, showed maximum sensitivity towards LPG...|$|R
