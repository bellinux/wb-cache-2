30|$|Quality of rice grain is {{a complex}} {{character}} composed of many components such as nutritional, appearance, cooking and eating qualities [25]. Thus, the physical properties such as size, shape, uniformity, and general appearance are of utmost importance in determining the final milling quality of rice grains. The <b>head</b> <b>grain</b> dimensions are important when evaluating the rice grain quality as they show clear differences with time due to grain filling [26]. The longer kernel length and other physico-chemical properties {{were found to be}} distinctive features of the rice cultivars [27]. The grain L/B ratio of the rice grain in all treatments was greater than 3 (Table  2), which could be classified as ‘slender’ in shape [19, 27]. Basmati type rice varieties are longer and slender than typical long grain, often with an L/B ratio in the rage of 3.84 – 5.01 [19].|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Three genetically {{different}} dwarf cultivars {{of spring}} wheat were evaluated as {{potential sources of}} short stature to use in a wheat improvement program. The study involved a five parent diallel cross which included a semidwarf, a standard height and three dwarf cultivars. The genetic sources of dwarfism included a Norma 10 derivative named Vicam 71, a derived line from Tom Thumb called Tordo, and Olesen dwarf. Experimental material consisted of parental lines, F₁, F₂, and both backcrosses to the parents space planted in a randomized block design. The agronomic characters measured on an individual plant basis were: (1) plant height, (2) days to heading, (3) number of tillers, (4) number of spikelets per spike, (5) head length, (6) days to maturity, (7) grain yield, (8) harvest index, (9) kernel weight, (10) number of kernels per spikelet, (11) rachis internode length, (12) grain filling period and, (13) <b>head</b> <b>grain</b> weight. Estimates of gene action were determined by heterosis, heterobeltiosis, broad and narrow sense heritabilities and combining ability analyses. Associations among traits were estimated by phenotypic, environmental, and genotypic correlations as well as path-coefficient analysis for grain yield and eight of the variables. There were significant differences among the parental lines, their crosses, and generations for all traits measured. Either partial dominance for tallness or no dominance was manifested for those crosses involving the dwarf cultivars Vicam 71 and Olesen. Tordo, when crossed to taller wheats showed dominance for short stature. All three genetic sources of dwarfism and their resulting progenies manifested desirable agronomic characteristics. Vicam 71 was a good parent in terms of grain yield and number of tillers per plant. Tordo was the best source for {{increasing the number of}} spikelets per spike, kernel weight and <b>head</b> <b>grain</b> weight. Olesen was a good progenitor for increasing number of kernels per spikelet. All three dwarf cultivars displayed some advantage(s) over the other two and all could be used to breed short statured wheats with a possibility of success. Plant height did not appear to have a direct effect on plant grain yield in any of the 10 crosses. With the exception of number of tillers per plant and grain yield, a major proportion of the phenotypic variability observed for all characters studied was due to genetic factors. A large portion of the total genetic variability associated with days to heading, maturity, height, rachis internode, spikelet number, kernels per spikelet, kernel weight, and harvest index was mainly a result of additive gene action. Both additive and non-additive genetic effects were involved in the expression of grain filling period and head weight. The nonadditive portion of the genetic variance associated with tiller number and grain yield per plant was relatively large when compared with the additive portion. Therefore, selection for increased expression of tillers and yield should be delayed until the F₄ or later generations where a large degree of homozygosity has been obtained. The genetic correlations for individual crosses indicated that {{only a few of the}} traits studied were associated in the same manner in most or all the 10 hybridizations. High positive genetic correlations were found between plant grain yield vs tiller number and kernels per spikelet, tiller number vs days to maturity, kernels per spikelet vs <b>head</b> <b>grain</b> weight, plant height vs head weight, and head length vs rachis internode length. High negative genetic correlations were found between kernel weight vs days to maturity, plant height vs harvest index, and days to heading vs grain filling period. Most correlations among agronomic traits were different in value and/or sign from one cross to another suggesting different gene associations in the parental cultivars. Genetic correlations between components of yield showed this type of inconsistency. Therefore, grain yield could be increased by a combined increase of more than one component of yield without compensatory oscillation among them because tiller number, spikelet number, kernels per spikelet and kernel weight were often not correlated between one another and sometimes were positively correlated. Path-coefficients analysis indicated that number of tiller per plant had a high direct effect on grain yield in all crosses. With the exception of two crosses, indirect effects of this trait were negligible. In the latter two crosses tiller number had a high negative indirect effect on plant grain yield via <b>head</b> <b>grain</b> weight. Kernels per spikelet and kernel weight had no direct effects on grain yield but their indirect effects via head weight were positive and significant. Large amounts of additive gene action were observed in the expression of plant height. This trait was also highly negatively correlated with harvest index; therefore, phenotypic selection for restricted plant height would be useful in obtaining lines with high grain to straw ratios. In general, crosses that showed high specific combining ability effects involved parents with low general combining ability. However, there were some exceptions to this rule. Crosses of high x high and high x low general combiners presented high specific combining ability effects, suggesting that some additive gene action may be involved in the superior performance of these combinations. Also the F ₂ generation did not differ from the F₁ in assessing general cornbining ability. A wheat breeder should be aware of those genetic associations between agronomic traits that could be used to select superior cultivars. However, the genetic correlations in this study suggested that each cross represented a different set of gene associations depending upon the parents involved. If some progress is to be made in using the genetic variability available in the crop, the breeder should not try to select exactly the same type of plant from every cross. Every hybridization is potentially a source of better lines if they are well planned and the reasons they were made are remembered during selection. It is very important to realize what are the contributions of each parental line in a cross and what are the most important trait associations present in each parent.

While the contribution made to grain yield by floral parts and the adjacent photosynthetic surfaces has been determined {{for a number of}} crop plants, such information lacks regarding safflower. Thus the present study was aimed at estimating the contribution of photosynthesis of safflower head and the two adjacent leaves to the grain yield of this oil seed crop. A 4 -replicate RCBD field experiment was conducted at Lavark Research Farm, Isfahan U. of Tech., using four genotypes (Nebraska 10, Kouseh, Arak 2811 and K 12) and three levels of shading (heads only, heads and the two adjacent leaves and control) on safflower heads following pollination, using khaki paper bags. Genotypes differed in terms of days to heading and maturity, height, number of heads per plant, number of seeds per head, 1000 -seed weight, seed weight per head and grain yield per plant. Shading on safflower head and the two adjacent leaves led to a significant decrease in number of seeds per head, 1000 -seed weight, seed weight per <b>head,</b> <b>grain</b> yield per plant and harvest index. There was not {{a significant difference between the}} two levels of shading treatment. It could be concluded that, with the environmental conditions experienced during spring 2003 at Isfahan, the photosynthetic products of safflower head and the two adjacent leaves may contribute to grain yield per plant by as much as 37 percent...|$|E

Measurements {{were made of}} grain and other material residing in different areas of rotary- and cylinder-type combines in replicated clean-outs during corn and soybean harvest and also in preliminary clean-outs during oat harvest. Concentration of the prior (i. e. commingled) grain was measured in the first grain harvested of the subsequent crop. Total material remaining in the combine ranged from 84 to 186 lb, 61 % of which was whole grain.

40|$|Effects of {{planting}} dates and weed control methods on yield and agronomic traits of sunflower was investigated. A factorial experiment {{based on a}} complete randomized blocks design with four replications was conducted in 2009. Treatments consisted of three planting date (April 4 th, May 5 th and Juns 5 th) and five weed control methods, Trifluralin (2 Lit/ha) + Fokus (1. 5 Lit/ha), Trifluralin+Nabu-s (3 Lit/ha), Trifluralin, Hand weeding and without control. Results indicated that planting dates and weed control methods significantly affected head diameter, 100 grain weight, seed number per head and grain yield. Harvest index and oil percent was affected only by planting dates. The highest grain yield (630. 1 g/m 2), was produced in the second planting date (May 5) by using Trifluralin+Fokus. Delaying sowing date (after May 5) significantly decreased grain yield. The most important weeds in the experimental site were common lambsquarter (Chenopodium album), field bind weed (Convolvulus arvensis), bastard cabbage (Rapistrum rugosum), flower-of-an-hour (Hibiscus trionum), cockspur grass (Echinochloa colorum) and green bristle grass (Setaria verticillata). It was observed that the dry matter weight sharply varied in all weed species in different planting dates, that is, in the 4 th April the dry matter production of common lambsquarter and bastard cabbage, in June 5 th planting date were maximum.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{study the effects of}} {{different}} levels of nitrogen fertilizer and plant density on grain yield and its components in sunflower, an experiment was conducted using 'Record' cultivar at the Research Farm of College of Agriculture, Isfahan University of Technology in 1996. Four levels of nitrogen (0, 75, 150 and 225 kg/ha) and four plant densities (65000, 75000, 85000 and 95000 plants/ha) were used in a split plot arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Developmental stages, plant height, stem diameter, head diameter, number of head per m 2, grain yield, biological yield, harvest index, 1000 -grain weight, number of grains per <b>head,</b> <b>grain</b> oil percentage, oil yield and grain protein content were measured. The results indicated that N fertilizer caused an extension of the growth period and means of days to physiological maturity. It also increased plant height, stem diameter and head diameter. While increasing plant density had an incremental effect on plant height, it negatively affected stem diameter and head diameter. N fertilizer up to 150 kg/ha increased the grain yield and biological yield, whereas higher levels of N fertilizer decreased both. Plant density of 85000 plants per hectare was observed as a suitable plant density, whereas the higher plant density had a negative effect on grain yield. N fertilizer via increasing the number of grains per head, and plant density via increasing the number of heads per unit area and also decreasing the number of grains per head influenced the grain yield. One-thousand grain weight was not affected by neither N fertilizer nor plant density. Considering the superiority of 150 kg/ha of N fertilizer and plant density of 85000 plants/ha for grain yield and oil yield, it appears that they could be recommended for producing desirable yield in the regions similar to the study region...|$|E

60|$|The year {{burst into}} glory to usher us forth {{out of the}} valley of Nethermere. The cherry trees had been {{gorgeous}} with heavy out-reaching boughs of red and gold. Immense vegetable marrows lay prostrate in the bottom garden, their great tentacles clutching the pond bank. Against the wall the globed crimson plums hung close together, and dropped occasionally with a satisfied plunge into the rhubarb leaves. The crop of oats was very heavy. The stalks of corn were like strong reeds of bamboo; the <b>heads</b> of <b>grain</b> swept heavily over like tresses weighted with drops of gold.|$|R
5000|$|Plants {{which are}} {{infected}} with Ustilago spp. actually grow taller and flower earlier than their healthy counterparts. This gives the infected plants an advantage in that the flowers of uninfected plants are more physically and morphologically susceptible to infection. The teliospores in the smutted <b>grain</b> <b>heads</b> disperse to the open flowers of the healthy plants, and the cycle continues.|$|R
