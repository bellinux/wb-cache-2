40|$|This article {{presents}} {{results of the}} particulate measurement P. M. 2. 5 and its presence in some metal elements. The monitoring took place once a week from April to December 2008. The material was collected taking as a rule the value of 65 g /m 3, delivered by E. P. A. to capture M. P. 2. 5, {{by means of a}} system that quantifies metal presence, measuring its concentration with atomic absorption equipment including a <b>graphite</b> <b>oven.</b> The results show the PM 2. 5 annual average is 38. 5 g/m 3, surpassing the standard only in three occasions. Regarding metallic element values, Fe presents the largest concentration with an average of 2. 5 m g/m; the lowest concentration was PB with 0. 01 m g/m 3. Most measurements are according to World Health Organization recommendations. It is concluded that PM 2. 5 concentrations are under this rule, as well as the studied metals...|$|E
40|$|With the {{objective}} of to evaluate {{the effect of the}} addition of orgainc chromium in the humoral immune response against rabies, five Neloreþs bovine breed groups with 15 animals each, were supplementeds with chromium yeast being the group GC (control), GV (vaccinated and without chromium), GV+ 8, 5 (vaccinated + 8, 5 ppm of chromium), GV+ 17 (vaccinated + 17 ppm of chromium) and GV+ 34 (vaccinated + 34 ppm of chromium). Serum samples of this animals were analyseds with serum neutralization test (SN) in albines mices in the days 30, 60 and 90 pos -vaccination. Simultaneously, serum concentrations of the chromium were determinated for analysis with spectrophotometer of atomic absorption in <b>graphite</b> <b>oven</b> and analysis of the cortisol was achieved through of the radioimmunoassay. These results allows to conclude that the animals of the group GV+ 34 have persistence of the protector's antibody titulation anti rabies until 90 days pos- vaccination. This response does not dependt of the cortisol levels, since the chromium donþt show to be effective to decrease its levels...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In the paper, the {{possibility}} of dense slurry reuse is studied, from COLTERM S. A. of Timisoara Thermal Plant, by embedding them into various building materials and by observing the heavy metal concentration evolution, contained originally by the slurry. The dense slurry usually had density of 1. 36 kg/dm 3, results as mixture of fly ash (resulted from burning the lignite coal) and the same quantity of water into the thermal plant; this operation is made with special devices. The building materials, poured in cube shape, were compacted manually, by shaking and keept in air until when were mechanical tested (compression strength). Migration of heavy metals, (Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb, Cd, Sr), from these materials into the soil, was analyzed by immersing the hardened cubs into ultrapure water (Millipore), simulating conditions of repeated torrential rainfalls. Determining the exact concentration, was made using novAA 400 G atomic absorption spectrophotometer, equipped with MP 60 autosampler, <b>graphite</b> <b>oven,</b> specialized software, WinAAS, for continuous data processing and predefined methods (CookBook) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} studies tomatoes grown in polluted soils to ascertain their phytochemical and nutritive features. Pulp and seeds from tomatoes grown in muddy soils were analyzed for their antioxidant power and their toxicity {{because of the}} possibility that heavy metals were present in the soils. An antioxidant assay on methanol extracts was made by using DDPH, while an ABTS [2, 2 '-Azino-bis-(3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) ] assay was used to evaluate the antioxidant activity of lipophilic fractions. Results of the antioxidant assay showed that the tomatoes maintained a high level of antioxidant activity especially in the lipophilic fractions which contain the most representative compounds. Cytotoxic activity was performed on HeLa, PDAC, and A 375 cell lines by [3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -phenyl- 2 H-tetrazolium bromide] (MTT) assay. Results showed that neither the seeds, nor the pulp, of the extracts was cytotoxic. The presence of heavy metals was evaluated by using spectroscopy of atomic absorption with a <b>graphite</b> <b>oven.</b> Test results show the absence of heavy metals and these results have an interesting scientific role because they provide useful information for promoting food safety...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the different characteristics of tobacco found in thirty brands of smuggled cigarettes in Brazil. Determination of arsenic through atomic absorption spectrometry in <b>graphite</b> <b>oven</b> was carried out and classical methodologies were employed to determine dirtiness, total ash, insoluble ash, humidity, tobacco pH and sidestream smoke pH. The methodology used to quantify arsenic presented quantification limit of 15. 0 ng g - 1 and detection limit of 4. 0 ng g - 1 in dry tobacco mass. The recovery of arsenic for the method purpose was 98. 2 % and relative standard deviation 6. 0 %. About 56 % of the brands were observed to have arsenic concentrations above 20. 0 ng g - 1, which means nearly twice as much as the arsenic found in cigarettes sold legally in Brazil. Levels above the recommended value for humidity were found in 53 % of brands. About 96 % of the brands presented total ash content above that indicated by the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia. About 53 % of the samples contained levels of insoluble ash above the limit. In 90 % of the samples, the smoke was alkaline. In dirtiness tests, 81. 2 % of the brands presented some kind of contaminant, such as fungi, insect fragments, grass or mites. The characteristics revealed that the consumption of this kind of cigarette can increase risks to consumer health.   DOI: [URL]  </p...|$|E
40|$|Metallic {{contaminants}} {{associated with}} sediments showed various behaviours depending on physicochemical conditions. Zayandeh-rood {{is one of}} the most important rivers of the centre of Iran. It sources from Zagros Mountains in Charmahal Bakhtiari province and flowing about 350 km, ends to the Gavkhooni marsh in the east of Isfahan. So far, many researches have been conducted to measure the concentration of heavy metals in the environmental samples all over the world and for this purpose, different methods have been proposed. Although several reports have been released concerning the amount of heavy metals concentrations in the air, water or food stuffs, there is less information available about the concentration of heavy metals in the sediments of the rivers and their mobility. The required samples for this research have been taken from 5 different areas: Zaman Khan Bridge, Falavarjan, Vahid Bridge, Ziar and Varzane. Two samples were collected from each of these regions. A five-step sequential extraction procedure, modified from the Tessier method, was applied to the determination of some heavy metals (Cu, Mn, Cd, Ni, Co, Cr, Zn and Pb) in sediment in order to evaluate the potential mobility of fixed metals. The amount of heavy metals were measured utilizing atomic absorption spectrometer (model AA- 220, Varian) equipped with <b>graphite</b> <b>oven</b> GTA- 110 and the accuracy of part per billion (ppb). A considerable amount of heavy metals exists in the sediments of Zayandeh-rood. These metals and specially manganese, cadmium and nickel have higher poisonous and carcinogenicity effects and mobility. These results therefore help to improve the waste management of such contaminated sediments...|$|E
