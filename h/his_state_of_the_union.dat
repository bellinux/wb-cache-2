5|$|Freedom from Fear is {{the last}} of the {{well-known}} Four Freedoms oil paintings produced by the American artist Norman Rockwell. The series was based on the four goals known as the Four Freedoms, which were enunciated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> Address on January 6, 1941. This work was published in the March 13, 1943, issue of The Saturday Evening Post alongside an essay by a prominent thinker of the day, Stephen Vincent Benét. The painting is generally described as depicting American children being tucked into bed by their parents while the Blitz rages across the Atlantic in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> Address on 23 January 2007, President Bush {{announced}} plans to deploy more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq in {{what became known as}} the Surge. Four thousand were specifically earmarked for Anbar, which Bush acknowledged had become both an AQI haven and a center of resistance against AQI. Instead of deploying new units, the Marine Corps chose to extend the deployments of several units already in Anbar: 1st Battalion 6th Marines, 3rd Battalion 4th Marines, and the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). The 15th MEU would later be replaced by the 13th MEU as the last surge unit.|$|E
5|$|Nixon was a late {{convert to}} the {{conservation}} movement. Environmental policy {{had not been}} a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects. Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.|$|E

25|$|Twice, the President of the United States or {{a future}} President has spoken at Four Seasons Arena. On February 3, 2005, President George W. Bush spoke there {{the day after}} <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> address to promote his plan to privatize Social Security. On May 30, 2008, presidential {{candidate}} Barack Obama spoke at the Four Seasons Arena.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson {{was not an}} {{outstanding}} orator and preferred to communicate through writing or remain silent if possible. Instead of delivering <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> addresses himself, Jefferson wrote the annual messages and sent a representative to read them aloud in Congress. This started a tradition which continued until 1913, when President Woodrow Wilson (1913–1921) chose to deliver his own State of the Union address.|$|E
25|$|In January 2015 President Obama {{announced}} the NIH-led Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) in <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> address. Through advances in research, technology, {{and policies that}} empower patients, PMI will enable {{a new era of}} precision medicine long envisioned by Collins and many others in which researchers, providers, and patients work together to develop more individualized care. In fiscal year 2016, the first funding for the initiative was awarded, with $130 million allocated to NIH to build a national, large-scale research participant group, called a cohort, and $70 million allocated to NIH's National Cancer Institute as part of PMI for Oncology. The PMI Cohort Program will seek to extend precision medicine to all diseases by building a national research cohort of 1 million or more U.S. participants. In January 2016, in <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> address, President Obama called for a new initiative, to be led by Vice President Joe Biden, to galvanize the nation's research efforts against cancer. Fueled by an additional $680 million in the proposed fiscal year 2017 budget for NIH, the National Cancer Moonshot Initiative will aim to accelerate progress toward the next generation of interventions to reduce cancer incidence and improve patient outcomes.|$|E

25|$|In 2011 {{state of}} the union address at the Parliament, Gilani spoke highly of culture, stating the {{historical}} cultural facts and values of cultural legacy of the country. <b>His</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>union</b> address came in response to American secret raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May 2011. Gillani also participated and celebrated the 60th anniversary of the bilateral relations between Pakistan and China. During the state visit of Wen Jiabao in 2010, Gillani and Wen proceeded to sign the cultural relations agreements after inaugurating the Pakistan-China Friendship Centre, a centre of excellence of promoting the cultural relations of China and Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|According to the Constitution, the President Elect {{must take}} the Oath of Office on December 1, before {{a joint session of}} Congress; the Constitution also states that the presidential term begins on December 1. Members of Congress {{belonging}} to the parties in the Coalition had threatened to disrupt the ceremony, with actions similar to those that prevented Vicente Fox from delivering <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> address on September 1. According to the Constitution, if the elected president does not take the Oath of Office on 1 December before a joint session, the presidency is declared vacant and an interim president must be named and new elections called.|$|E
25|$|Claire relocates to Dallas {{and runs}} for Congress {{in her home}} district. The incumbent, Doris Jones, plans to retire and endorse her {{daughter}} Celia as her successor. Claire offers them federal funding for a key Planned Parenthood clinic in exchange for stepping down, but they refuse the offer. Frank wins back Claire's support by promising not to sabotage her campaign in Texas, but he later publicly endorses Celia in <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> address. Frank and Claire travel to South Carolina for a primary, {{but a series of}} scandals causes Frank to narrowly lose the state to Dunbar. Frank discovers that Claire had been leaking information to Dunbar, and she threatens to continue unless he names her as his running mate. Frank refuses.|$|E

25|$|When Ellerbe {{delivered}} <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Department speech (the {{first ever}} delivered by a fire chief), more than 100 firefighters {{turned their backs}} to him and then walked out to protest the plan.|$|R
25|$|The {{president}} inaugurated {{planning for}} the New Look in July 1953 by asking the incoming members of the JCS (Admiral Arthur W. Radford, chairman; General Matthew B. Ridgway, Army chief of staff; General Nathan F. Twining, Air Force chief of staff; and Admiral Robert B. Carney, chief of naval operations) to prepare a paper on overall defense policy. Although the JCS paper did not recommend any fundamental changes, the National Security Council in October 1953 adopted a key tenet of the New Look that a large-scale limited war or a general war would likely be fought with nuclear weapons. Eisenhower formally presented the New Look in <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> message in January 1954 and Secretary Wilson helped to explain it. More defense for less money was possible, he said. With new weapons and techniques and ready reserves of troops and materiel, the United States could support capable military forces within budget allocations that Congress was willing to provide.|$|E

Other significant regulatory legislation enacted during Nixon's presidency included the: Noise Control Act (1972); Marine Mammal Protection Act (1972); Consumer Product Safety Act (1972); and the Endangered Species Act (1973).|$|E
500|$|In December 1885, U.S. President Grover Cleveland {{presented}} <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> {{report to}} Congress, and in it, {{his reaction to}} the Rock Springs massacre.

500|$|Freedom of Worship or Freedom to Worship is {{the second}} of the Four Freedoms oil {{paintings}} produced by the American artist Norman Rockwell.

Roosevelt, in <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> Address delivered on January 6, 1941. [...] Rockwell considered this painting and Freedom of Speech the most successful of the series. Freedom of Worship was published on the 27th of February, 1943, issue of The Saturday Evening Post alongside an essay by philosopher Will Durant.|$|E
500|$|The {{conflict}} {{also helped}} {{to promote a}} change in U.S. policy regarding Native Americans. Previously, many Americans had argued that Indians should be [...] "civilized" [...] and assimilated into white American society. But for some, the Winnebago War discredited the idea that Indians and Americans could live peaceably together. In <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> Address of December 2, 1828, outgoing President Adams announced that the [...] "civilization" [...] policy had been a failure, and that Indian removal—moving the tribes to the West—was {{the policy of the}} future. That policy would be taken up by Adams's successor, Andrew Jackson.|$|E
500|$|Prior to June 2014, Obama offered {{substantial}} {{support for a}} broadly-based [...] "All of the above" [...] approach to domestic energy policy, which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> speech in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry {{and its impact on}} the domestic economy. Obama's approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy such as coal mining and oil fracking has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of the nation's available energy resources.|$|E
50|$|It was former President Manuel A.

500|$|To Marcy's chagrin, the {{flamboyant}} Soulé {{made no secret}} of the meetings. The press in both Europe and the U.S. were well aware of the proceedings if not their outcome, but were preoccupied with wars and midterm elections. In the latter case, the Democratic Party became a minority in the United States Congress, and editorials continued to chide the Pierce administration for its secrecy. At least one newspaper, the New York Herald, published what Brown calls [...] "reports that came so close to the truth of the decisions at Ostend that the President feared they were based on leaks, as indeed they may have been". Pierce feared the political repercussions of confirming such rumors, and he did not acknowledge them in <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> address at the end of 1854. The administration's opponents in the House of Representatives called for the document's release, and it was published in full four months after being written.|$|E
