40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMini and micro computers represent the newest {{developments in the}} computer field. Their small size, low cost, and wide ranging versatility make them valuable devices for use in communications systems. They {{can be used to}} perform many of the message handling functions previously performed by the main computer, thus freeing it for its more important application tasks. The use of mini and micro computers as front end processors, data concentrators and terminal controllers is investigated, as well as the general hardware and software features such small computers must have to perform communications functions. A cost comparison between minicomputers, microcomputers and <b>hardwired</b> <b>devices</b> is also presented. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWireless network {{interface}} cards (WNIC) are currently moving from <b>hardwired</b> <b>devices</b> to autonomic software. This paper proposes a new {{rationale for the}} design of WNIC that i) takes into account the need to integrate an ever increasing number of network features, ii) supports the traceability of requirements in system development and iii) allows flexibility at the software architecture level. Our solution relies on the FODA (feature oriented domain analysis) and FORM (feature oriented reuse method) engineering methods {{to bridge the gap between}} the systemspsila specification and implementation. As an example, we show how a model of the 802. 11 standard based on this method can reproduce the features of a particular channel access protocol or be extended to the 802. 11 g standard...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{describe}} a geometric layout of quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) cells and an associated set of clock signals {{that can be}} used to implement a programmable array of logic (PAL). PALs are an important category of programmable logic that can be programmed (typically once) to perform a particular sum-of-products Boolean operation. The particular device described has six inputs, four product terms, and one output. The connections between the inputs and the product terms are fully re-programmable, while the connections between the product terms and the output are <b>hardwired.</b> This <b>device</b> takes 22 clock cycles to load the connection data and then completes the calculation in 57 cycles. The connection data are preserved in memory, so additional calculations with the same set of connections can be performed in just 57 cycles each...|$|R

During the last two decades of the 20 th century, a confluence of three seemingly disparate but inevitably linked trends emerged that have had an impact on workplace performance. In particular, the changes in work structures and world economies, the innovative and ubiquitous use of technologies in every facet of work, and the considerable applicable research on human cognition have made noteworthy contributions to team work. However, these trends have made seemingly little impact toward a holistic model for team problem solving. To work toward guidelines for a holistic model, this study used a case method to determine criteria used by a successful problem-solving team within a global training corporation. Findings suggest that successful problem solving occurs in that space of congruence in which the business context is a critical consideration as well as the three functions of communications, navigation, and technologies. The three categories of communications, navigation, and technologies, in addition to context, provide a more systematic approach to problem solving. Communications, as a broad function, suggests to group problem solvers that they need to consider all aspects of how information is shared, stored, and retrieved. Navigation, a term taken from common parlance to explain the way users function on the Internet, refers to knowledge of processes the team uses to plan and execute their course through a problem-solving session. This knowledge includes the skills with which to execute the navigation. Technologies, as a broad category, refers to tools and tactics team members use to navigate through the process of problem solving. These technologies, ranging from hard to soft, can include <b>hardwired</b> <b>devices</b> such as groupware or video conferencing, as well as softer tools such as brainstorming on flip chart paper. Suggestions for future research include using a case method across several successful teams to reveal consistencies and variances. Other lines of research include determining factors that inhibit the use of a group facilitator and developing methods for detecting problem-solving patterns in chaotic environments. More specifically, the literature suggests a move away from distinct problem-solving models because they may support static approaches to decontextualized problem solving. Thus, a case study research agenda to implement the problem-solving guidelines put forth from this study in a receptive team environment is suggested...|$|R
40|$|Project (M. S., Computer Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Wireless Sensor Devices are {{becoming}} a more attractive choice as a sensor platform compared to <b>hardwired</b> sensor <b>devices</b> because of the ease of installation and freedom in sensor placement. Wireless Sensor Devices are usually installed in mass quantity to form a Wireless Sensor Network to sense environmental changes, to track movement in battlefield or military zones, and to monitor any desired function in the industrial or commercial setting. This project {{is an effort to}} learn about the security requirements of a Wireless Sensor Network by analyzing the security mechanisms that have been developed through the TinyOS project. However, certain basic knowledge must be obtained first in order to fully understand the security requirements of a Wireless Sensor Network. Thus, the project starts with an overview of the Wireless Sensor Devices hardware architecture. Then, the project describes the Wireless Sensor Devices network stack and its security mechanisms. The Wireless Sensor Network security requirements are introduced along with some common Wireless Sensor Network attacks and their counter measures. Finally, the project describes the software development process for Wireless Sensor Devices using TinyOS. The results of the project are a procedure for setting up the TinyOS development environment to program Wireless Sensor Devices to form a Wireless Sensor Network, and an analysis of Wireless Sensor Network security software suites such as IEEE 802. 15. 4, ZigBee, SPINS (SNEP and uTesla), TinySec, SomeSec, TinyPK, and TinyECC.

40|$|Sensors for {{detecting}} micrometeorite impact locations and magnitudes {{as well as}} pressure vessel leaks have been under investigation for some time by the NASA Langley Research Center and other related entities. NASA has been investigating {{the use of the}} Distribution Impact Detection System (DIDS) for use on the International Space Station (ISS). However, the DIDS currently requires thionyl chloride lithium batteries which pose explosion and toxicity hazards, and replacing batteries is tedious and utilizes scarce man-hours. Carrying replacement batteries into space is also expensive. To <b>hardwire</b> new sensing <b>devices</b> into the ISS while in orbit would be time consuming. To overcome this problem, high efficiency GaAs solar cells have been studied under low light conditions comparable to those found inside the ISS. The cells were also studied for temperature dependence. Solar concentrators were investigated for possible use with ambient lighting. The power generated by the cells was stored in a large 300 F supercapacitor. A DC to DC boost regulator was modified to produce an output voltage of 3. 55 V that is required by the DIDS. The successful operation of the DIDS with ambient light power, supercapacitor energy storage, and boost regulation was demonstrated...|$|R
