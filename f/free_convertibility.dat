40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to improve {{understanding}} of the gold standard period in Portugal through comparison with other monetary systems that were operated afterwards. Portugal was the first country in Europe to join Great Britain in the gold standard, in 1854, and it adhered to it for quite a long time. The principle of <b>free</b> gold <b>convertibility</b> of the Portuguese currency at a fixed price was abandoned in 1891, even though the classical gold standard as an international monetary system only began to fall apart as a result of the upheavals of the First World War. For the purposes of a macroeconomic study, we can thus first look at the expansion of the functioning of the gold standard in Portugal up to 1913. In addition to a desire to share the same monetary system as its trading and financial partner, the low price of gold and the domestic circulation of British gold coins also played a part, along with other factors, in the adoption of the gold standard in Portugal. While it was in force, it provided a nominal stable anchor and a mechanism of credible commitment, even though Portugal’s monetary authorities broke the “rules of the game”. Our analysis points out the mistake of comparing the stability of different monetary systems with the same indicators. The application of a VAR model enabled us to isolate the period 1854 - 1891 as being the one that actually corresponds to what we expect of gold standard behaviour. Examination of demand, supply and monetary shocks yields interesting results that confirm the idea that the principles of classical economics are appropriate for the gold standard period.

40|$|The author reviews {{possible}} {{trade and}} exchange rate policies of the former Soviet Union. Alternative exchange rate regimes, including a monetary union are considered. For Russia, a fixed but adjustable regime is most realistic. Frequent adjustment may be desirable, to prevent the use of trade restrictions to achieve balance of payments objectives. The author examines the need for transitional tariffs, including the argument for a temporary uniform tariff that {{is higher than the}} long-run revenue tariff. The temporary uniform tariff is designed to prevent temporary overshooting of the exchange rate. The case for a free trade area is strong because the republics of the former Soviet Union are so highly specialized, but there will be problems if price controls remain and differ among the republics. There could be a free trade area even if there is no monetary union. The author concludes that one approach to trade policy is to have no trade policy - to have completely <b>free</b> trade with <b>convertibility</b> for current account transactions. Some tariffs and export taxes may be justified, at least as second-best policies. If so, the author stresses that four principles be observed: 1) barriers to existing trade between the republics should not be set up; 2) all quantitative control measures should be avoided; 3) tariff and export tax structures should be very simple; and 4) trade policy should be transparent.

40|$|IF BANKS {{maintain}} fractional {{reserve ratios}} and convert deposits into currency upon request, {{as in the}} U.

Moreover, SHFTZ runs the risk of evolving into an offshore RMB market set up inside China, a trend China should prevent because it cannot serve the testing missions mentioned above...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic {{general equilibrium model}} of a small, open, monetary economy in order to analyze the short-run effects of credible stabilization plans that fix the nominal exchange rate in a regime of <b>free</b> <b>convertibility.</b> In this model inflation acts as a tax on domestic market transactions. In particular, it generates a wedge between the {{rate of return on}} investment in domestic capital and the rate of return on investment in foreign assets. The model stresses the importance of adjustment costs (including gestation lags) in explaining the precise character of the initial dynamics. The main stylized facts of this type of programs namely an initial phase characterized by several months of real exchange rate appreciation, trade balance deterioration and expansion in aggregate demand and production, followed by a deflationary slowdown in real activity, are replicated without resorting to credibility problems, sticky prices, adaptive expectations, or gradual disinflation schemes. Finally, the model is calibrated using long-run relations from the Argentinean economy, and its quantitative predictions are compared to the initial effects of that country's Convertibility Plan of April 1991.

40|$|The {{prospect}} of central banks issuing digital currency (CBDC) immediately {{raises the question}} of how this new form of money should co-exist and interact with existing forms of money. This paper evaluates three different scenarios for the implementation of CBDC in terms of their monetary policy implications. In the ‘money user scenario’ CBDC co-exists with both cash and commercial bank deposits. In the ‘money manager scenario’ cash is abolished and CBDC co-exists only with commercial bank deposits. And in the ‘money maker scenario’ commercial bank deposits are abolished and CBDC co-exist only with cash. The evaluation is based on an adaption of the classical international monetary policy trilemma to a domestic monetary system with multiple forms of money. Our proposition is that a monetary system with two competing money creators, the central bank and the commercial banking sector, can simultaneously only pursue two out of the following three policy objectives: <b>Free</b> <b>convertibility</b> between CBDC and bank money, parity between CBDC and bank money, and central bank monetary sovereignty, which is the use of monetary policy for anything else than support for commercial bank credit creation. This means that the decision on the design of a monetary system with CBDC implies a crucial political decision on the priorities of the central bank...|$|E
40|$|About {{five decades}} the Franc CFA-Zone in Western and Central Africa was praised as {{incarnation}} {{of economic and}} political stability in Africa, backed by France. But <b>free</b> <b>convertibility</b> and fixed parity, guaranteed by the French Treasury, mainly served the interest of a small elite of the Messieurs Afrique, both in France and in Africa. Generations of French entrepreneurs and of their African counterparts maintained a profitable self-service shop on expense of the African poor and the French taxpayer. In the aftermath of the devaluation of the Franc CFA in 1994, and of the peg of the currency to the Euro in 1998, the socio-economic divide between rich and poor, urban and rural regions, the formal and the informal sector even widened. However, the perpetuation of the established monetary structure of the CFA-Zone became increasingly anachronistic. As far as the political stability, previously guaranteed by the neo-colonial French Africa policy, becomes obsolete, the base for economic stability of the traditional arrangement of the currency union is threatened as well. The more so, as the CFA-Zone never fulfilled the most crucial preconditions of an optimal currency area. The peg to the EMU, orientated at the interests of highly industrialized European countries, led to an overvaluation of the real exchange rate of the CFA, and will increasingly constitute an obstacle to sustainable indigenous development in francophone Africa. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{classical}} gold standard, which prevailed {{from the}} 1870 s to the First World War, was characterised by fixed exchange rates, <b>free</b> <b>convertibility</b> and perfect capital mobility {{and was considered}} the dominant international monetary system of the time. As trilemma hypothesis suggests, the Ottoman Empire enjoyed fixed exchange rates and foreign capital flows under the golden rule, but lost its monetary sovereignty. However, the extent of this loss was far more apparent than in other core and peripheral countries. As a result, the gold standard in the Ottoman Empire was characterised {{by a set of}} “anomalies” such as the existence of competing monetary authorities, persistence of territorial exchange rates and monetary zones and widely circulating multiple standard and sub-standard coins. This paper analyses these unique features as changing degrees of monetary sovereignty under the golden rule and revisits the evidence. By relying on a new dataset, it compares the Ottoman case with major core and peripheral countries of Europe in 1880 - 1913. It explores the hypothesis that ability of the gold standard countries to determine the composition and size of the monetary base was not homogenous. The paper suggests that the differences in monetary sovereignty for the period can best be explained by differences in monetary institutions regulating the relationship between governments and central issue banks. This in return offers a framework explaining the wide variations across peripheries...|$|E

40|$|User {{mobility}} is {{the principal}} driving force for wireless communication systems. How to handle user mobility efficiently {{is a very important}} issue in radio resource management. The aim of the thesis is to study the impact of mobility on call admission control and packet scheduling in different wireless cellular networks. An analytical model is developed to evaluate the mobility/capacity conversion process in TDMA/FDMA wireless networks with different resource allocation strategies. Given a QoS requirement, a wireless network has to sacrifice some of its capacity to support an increase in mobility. The model can guide us in designing a more efficient mobility handling strategy. The study also has a more practical implication on network architecture: a wireless network, if designed correctly, should have a <b>free</b> <b>convertibility</b> between mobility and capacity. When user mobility decreases, a network should be {{able to take advantage of}} the mobility change and convert it into a capacity gain and support more users An analytical interference/call admission model is also developed to study the impact of the mobility on CDMA networks. The interference model includes the effects of soft handoff, power control error and shadowing. We combined this interference model with a Markov model to study the performance of CDMA systems with call admission control under various mobility and traffic conditions. An interference-cushion scheme is also presented to mitigate the negative effect of mobility on network capacity. Finally, the impact of mobility on packet-data scheduling is investigated. We formulate the cross-layer scheduler design problem in a multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MISO) system under several different mobility-related scenarios and evaluate how throughput and fairness criteria change as user mobility varies. The model captures both the physical layer and system-level parameters affected by mobility. It provides new insights into how the schedulers should be designed according to mobility conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to analyze the importance of banking in Mexico. The banking system in Mexico is the result of a complex transformation of processes as deregulation, expansion, crisis, nationalization, foreign ownership and privatization. In 1983, commercial banks were transformed into national credit; later, in 1985 with the purpose of rationalize and optimize their operations, their number decreased. Since 1988 the country began a process of economic and financial reform. Gradually, selective credit drawers were removed and interest rates (Solis, 1997) were liberalized. Between 1991 and 1992, the 18 banks which had hitherto belonged to the government were divested. For some experts, the privatization mechanism was inappropriate because it benefited brokerage firms that, in some cases, were property of former directors of the commercial banks. In addition, the newly privatized banks took advantage of the inadequate regulation and supervision to foster an excessive increase in credit (above the real dynamics of the economy), joined to the precarious risk assessment practices and technological underdevelopment in the banking sector at that time (De la Cruz and Alcántara, 2011). Two years later, in 1994, capital outflows and currency imbalances were consequence of political events that contaminated the economic environment at the time, which significantly reduced the market liquidity. This was worsened by the issuance of short-term government bonds denominated in dollars and <b>free</b> <b>convertibility,</b> which caused a rapid decline of international reserves and an economic crisis. Both the crisis and the devaluation of the currency (in December 1994) increased the bank nonperforming loans (NPLs). In addition, rising interest rates and higher unemployment, exacerbated the breach of obligations of debtors, causing serious problems in the banking sector, forcing the government to speed up the entry of foreign capital into the sector with the aim to find alternative sources of funding (Clavellina, 2013) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the decade}} between the Asia Minor debacle of 1922 {{and the foreign}} loan default of 1932, the Greek State formed tight links with the {{international}} capital market. This thesis examines the foreign loans raised. It investigates: the negotiations involved; the institutional framework through which these loans were provided; how they were used; and how they enhanced foreign tutelage over Greece. Book I explores the loans issued {{under the auspices of}} the Legue of Nations. It analyses how the League tackled the Refugee problem and uncovers how the stabilization plan was devised. It demonstrates the manner in which the League, the Bank of England and the British Treasury co-operated as regards Greece; and how these institutions withheld foreign finance (e. g. via embargoes) to force Greece to attain political stability and curb military expenditure. Book I also focuses on the divergent economic philosophy of the Greek authorities vis-a-vis the League and the Bank of England. Moreover, it brings to the surface the underlying antagonism between the International Financial Commission and the League of Nations. In addition, the parameters, other than the world economic crisis, that contributed to the demise of <b>free</b> <b>convertibility</b> in Greece are delineated. Finally, the stabilization experiment of the twenties is placed in a comparative perspective. Book II discusses foreign capital inflow outside 'formal' international control. This category of loans financed the development of infrastructure by foreign firms through 'agency' contracts. The terms and how the projects were carried out is investigated. The momentum attained in public works prior to stabilization and why it was not maintained during the gold exchange standard system is delineated. The growing dependence of the State on Hambros and the intimate relationship this merchant bank enjoyed with Greece's supervisors and the National Bank of Greece is brought into relief. Finally, an important issue analysed throughout the thesis is the internal weakness of the Greek state...|$|E
40|$|The {{architects of}} the post-World War II {{international}} economic order considered the <b>free</b> <b>convertibility</b> of currencies for current account purposes {{one of the fundamental}} prerequisites of multilateral trade and thus of economic growth. While the Bretton Woods system started operating in 1946, the Western European countries only formally established currency convertibility in December 1958. So far, analytical studies of the return to convertibility are scarce. The few studies that exist generally treat convertibility as a technical, monetary issue, even a simple formality. The prevailing view is that, because of its trade-facilitating characteristic, convertibility was a widely accepted and uncontroversial economic policy objective shared by the Western European countries. This assumption follows from the belief that the Bretton Woods period was characterized by an international consensus on the benefits and desirability of international trade and long-term economic growth. The collective move to convertibility is regarded as proof of this consensus and of the willingness to cooperate to achieve common goals. Therefore, most accounts consist of historical narratives of Western Europe's path to convertibility rather than analyses of the development within the context of national policy aims. The comparison of Britain, France and the Federal Republic of Germany shows that convertibility was a far more complex, even controversial issue than has so far been argued in the literature. This thesis analyzes the national policy on convertibility in each country, respectively, by comparing the importance of convertibility for trade, macroeconomic policy, foreign policy and economic adjustment. Economic and political considerations {{played a crucial role in}} each country's policy on convertibility. The comparative analysis of the three leading countries' national economic policy on convertibility reveals a fundamental divergence in general long-term policy orientations in the three countries, challenging the widely accepted idea of a post-war consensus among Western European countries on the long-term policy objectives. The collective return to convertibility represented a very versatile tool, which the key countries employed to fulfill different, often incompatible, objectives. The national economic and political circumstances, which determined French, British and German policy on convertibility explain why the return to convertibility occurred in December 1958 and why the key countries coordinated their efforts. In particular, the establishment of convertibility was intricately linked to national policies on European integration. As a vehicle for national economic policy the return to convertibility provides important new insights into the formation of national exchange rate policy and international monetary cooperation in the 1950 s...|$|E
