5|$|Benn {{was born}} in London on 3 April 1925. He had two brothers, Michael, who was older, and David, a {{specialist}} in Russia and Eastern Europe. Their father, William Wedgwood Benn, was a Liberal Member of Parliament from 1906 who crossed the <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Labour Party in 1928 and was appointed Secretary of State for India by Ramsay MacDonald in 1929, a position he held until the Labour Party's landslide electoral defeat in 1931. William Benn was elevated to the House of Lords with the title of Viscount Stansgate in 1942 – the new wartime coalition government was short of working Labour peers in the upper house. In 1945–46, William Benn was the Secretary of State for Air in the first majority Labour Government.|$|E

5|$|Birds roam {{from the}} forest <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> canopy, but {{particularly}} favour the middle story. They mostly operate alone, in pairs or groups of three, and {{can also be found}} mixing with long-billed bernierias. Larger flocks do not occur. The nelicourvi weaver is an agile, active species that generally makes a lot of noise. It searches for insects on leaves, and branches, while hanging from vines and twigs. It looks for animals in rolled leaves such as wild ginger Aframomum and along leaf litter, probing crevices, and opening dead stems. It also dismembers flowers to reach the nectar. Mostly, arthropods (beetles, bugs, butterflies, caterpillars, dragonflies, flies, grasshoppers, leafhoppers, stick insects, millipedes and spiders) are consumed, sometimes small vertebrates (lizards and chameleons), next to some nectar, fruit and probably seeds.|$|E
5|$|Oregon Agricultural College {{opened a}} new library in 1918, marking {{the first time that}} the library had its own building. Prior to 1918 the library had been housed on the second floor of the college's {{administration}} building, Benton Hall. When the new building was completed, the school built a temporary trellis from neighboring Benton Hall's second <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second floor of the new building in order to more easily transfer the books to their new location. Initially, the new building also housed offices and classrooms, but within a decade the library expanded to occupy all of the structure. John V. Bennes designed the new building, as well as many of the campus buildings constructed during that period. By 1922 the collection had grown to 73,000 volumes, and Lucy M. Lewis served as the school's librarian.|$|E
5|$|The South Tower has one freight {{and three}} {{passenger}} elevators. The elevators are the second fastest {{in the city}} of San Francisco, second only to those in 555 California Street and tied with those in 555 Mission Street. The elevators of the South Tower can travel from the ground <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 61st floor (the mechanical level) in only 26 seconds to speed passenger traffic flow. This means the elevators can travel about 1,200 vertical feet (366 m) in a minute. The elevators have artificial intelligence control systems that figure out passenger traffic patterns and dispatch the three elevators to handle passenger needs accordingly. The bottom of each elevator shaft has a cylinder filled with hydraulic oil to stop a falling elevator without injuring the passengers inside.|$|E

5|$|The UFA {{was in an}} {{uncertain}} position when Reid became Premier; besides Brownlee's resignation, longtime Minister of Public Works Oran McPherson {{was in the midst}} of a scandalous divorce and had also left cabinet, and UFA MLAs Peter Miskew and Omer St. Germain had crossed the <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Liberals. Additionally, the province's economic condition remained poor. Liberal leader William R. Howson tried to take advantage of this to undermine the government and position himself as the province's next Premier; he attacked Reid relentlessly for what he alleged were spendthrift habits, and suggested the province's tax rates were causing the confiscation of family homes. Reid asserted in response that Alberta's taxes had decreased since 1921, and criticised Howson for simultaneously attacking government spending and demanding new infrastructure projects.|$|E

Her head is tilted towards him and her eyelids joyfully lowered, while his hand (now broken) is holding hers. Their dress reflect the Hindu customs. He wears the sacred thread across his chest, she the customary jewelry. The other characters shown in the wedding carry items or are shown holding items that typically grace a Hindu wedding.

5|$|The {{remaining}} original woodwork, sills, door frames, {{and interior}} doors, are all solid oak. The interior walls are 12inches thick and, either painted or covered with paneling.

The interior floors are all white pine wood, though some of the floors have now been carpeted. First floor ceilings are 15feet high, with doors at a height of 12feet. The second floor features the courtrooms, which, through the 1980s remodel, had the ceilings lowered to 10feet. The interior renovation was completed at a cost of US$1.5 million.|$|E

5|$|This design {{followed}} the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms {{scattered over the}} two main floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate. As a consequence of this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on {{the first and second}} floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be grand and imposing, rose to {{the east side of the}} house, and formed part of the guest's state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> principal dining room and bedroom on the second. This older concept is more clearly exemplified at the Elizabethan Hardwick Hall in neighbouring Derbyshire.|$|E
5|$|Through use of {{the land}} trade along the Silk Road and {{maritime}} trade by sail at sea, the Tang were able to gain many new technologies, cultural practices, rare luxury, and contemporary items. From the Middle East, India, Persia, and Central Asia the Tang were able to acquire new ideas in fashion, new types of ceramics, and improved silver-smithing. The Chinese also gradually adopted the foreign concept of stools and chairs as seating, whereas the Chinese beforehand always sat on mats placed on the <b>floor.</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> Middle East, the Islamic world coveted and purchased in bulk Chinese goods such as silks, lacquerwares, and porcelain wares. Songs, dances, and musical instruments from foreign regions became popular in China during the Tang dynasty. These musical instruments included oboes, flutes, and small lacquered drums from Kucha in the Tarim Basin, and percussion instruments from India such as cymbals. At the court there were nine musical ensembles (expanded from seven in the Sui dynasty) representing music from throughout Asia.|$|E
5|$|For the National Register of Historic Places nomination, {{only the}} {{interior}} {{of one of the}} four units was surveyed, the second floor interior of 341 Broadway. This unit is accessed from a spiral staircase leading from the first <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attic. The second floor landing has a short foyer before opening to two parlors. The front parlor is said to have had a water fountain which was removed, but the plumbing is said to exist within the floor. The back parlor has a Queen Anne mantel and leads to the dining room with large floor-to-ceiling china closets. Located {{on the east side of}} the apartment is the kitchen, pantry and rear staircase. The north part of the apartment contains two bedrooms and a bath. The NRHP nomination states that the alterations to the unit were minimal and it is likely that the same would have been done for the first floor unit. The northern Fuller House, containing 343-345 Broadway, has been more seriously modified because it has been split into four units. In 2013, real estate information for 343 Broadway suggests the expanse of the modifications to the house by listing the property as having 20 rooms, with 8 bedrooms and 5 baths. According to Trulia the house was sold in 2010 for $140,000 and still in the four unit configuration. A three-bay stuccoed garage dating from the 1920s or 1930 is used by 339-341 Broadway.|$|E

5|$|In {{a second}} incident, the Army {{considered}} court-martialling several {{officers of the}} 157th Infantry Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Felix L. Sparks after servicemen were accused of massacring German soldiers who were surrendering at the Dachau concentration camp in 1945. Some of the German troops were camp guards; the others were sick and wounded troops from a nearby hospital. The soldiers of the 45th Division who liberated the camp were outraged at the malnourishment and maltreatment of the 32,000 prisoners they liberated, some barely alive, and all victims of the Holocaust. After entering the camp, the soldiers found boxcars filled with dead bodies of prisoners who had succumbed to starvation or last-minute executions, and in rooms adjacent to gas chambers they found naked bodies piled from the <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ceiling. The cremation ovens, which were still in operation when the soldiers arrived, contained bodies and skeletons as well. Some of the victims apparently had died only hours before the 45th Division entered the camp, while many others lay where they had died in states of decomposition that overwhelmed the soldiers' senses. Accounts conflict over what happened and over how many German troops were killed. After investigating the incident, the Army considered court-martialling several officers involved, but Patton successfully intervened. Seventh Army was being disbanded and Patton had been appointed Military Governor of Bavaria, placing the matter in his hands. Some veterans of the 45th Infantry Division have said that only 30 to 50 German soldiers were killed and that very few were killed trying to surrender, while others have admitted to killing or refusing to treat wounded German guards.|$|E
5|$|The temple is {{enclosed}} in the cave, it has interior walls but no exterior wall. The pillars create {{the space and}} symmetric rhythm as they support the weight of hill above. The main mandapa recesses into a pillared vestibule (ardha-mandapa) on the south side, while a pillared portico (mukha-mandapa) connects it to the main entrance. Embedded within the Great Cave are dedicated shrines, the largest {{of which is the}} square plan Linga shrine (see 16 in plan). It is a square garbha-griya (womb house) with four entrances, located in the right section of the main hall. Steps lead from the four doorways into the sanctum, which has a linga in the mulavigraha style. Each doorway is guarded by a dvarapala on each side, for a total of eight dvarapalas, their heights spanning <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ceiling. These were badly damaged when the Portuguese ceded control of this region to the British. The linga shrine is surrounded by a mandapa and circumambulation path (pradakshina-patha) as in other Hindu temples. The pillars are similarly aligned east-west to this shrine, and have an east entrance. Overlaid, as if fused, on the architecture of this temple is another open temple aligned to the north-south direction with three faced Sadashiva as its focal center. One features the abstract, unmanifest, aniconic symbol of Shiva, the other anthropomorphic, manifest, iconic symbol of Shiva. The mandapa pillars of the two align up.|$|E
