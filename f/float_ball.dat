50|$|Toilets {{accounted}} for almost 30% of residential indoor water {{use in the}} United States in 1999. One flush of a standard U.S. toilet requires more water than most individuals, and many families, in the world use for all their needs in an entire day.A home’s toilet water sustainability can be improved {{in one of two}} ways: improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet. To improve the current toilet, one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank. Also, there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase. A tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank. A float booster attaches underneath the <b>float</b> <b>ball</b> of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets. It allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level, saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush. A major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks. A slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye, but can waste hundreds of gallons each month. One way to check this is to put food dye in the tank, and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color. In the event of a leaky flapper, one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper, which allows self-adjustment of the amount of water per flush.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} laparoscopic partial nephrectomy assisted by a water-cooled, high-density, monopolar device (TissueLink <b>Floating</b> <b>Ball).</b> Methods. Transperitoneal laparoscopic partial nephrectomy was performed without vascular control for four renal tumors in 3 patients. A flexible ultrasound probe was used to confirm tumor location and depth. Gerota’s fascia was opened distant from the tumor site. Renal fat was dissected from the renal parenchyma except for the fat overlying the tumor. The tumor resection area was marked 1 cm outside {{the boundaries of the}} tumor. After application of the TissueLink <b>Floating</b> <b>Ball</b> at the planned surgical margin, the tumor was resected with cold laparoscopic scissors. Bleeding from the vessels of the divided renal parenchyma was controlled with the <b>Floating</b> <b>Ball</b> if necessary. The specimen was sent for frozen section to confirm margin status. Results. Mean estimated blood loss per tumor was 275 mL. The dissection extended to the collecting system in 2 of 4 cases. In 1 patient, a minor postoperative urine leak resolved spontaneously. Conclusions. Use of the TissueLink <b>Floating</b> <b>Ball</b> facilitated resection of small renal tumors without renal vascular control.

This paper will present the advantages of using an insulating blanket of hollow plastic spheres as a mechanism to conserve this type of industrial energy loss. FIRST: The theory of a <b>floating</b> <b>ball</b> blanket will be covered. Claims on the effectiveness of a ball blanket will be substantiated by results obtained from independent testing laboratories. Slides and graphs of these results, as well as photographs of industrial applications will be presented. NEXT: Attention will be given to specific industries in which open tank energy loss is common. Metal finishing, chemical manufacturing, power generation, sewage/wastewater, and food manufacturing will be highlighted. Other benefits obtainable from <b>floating</b> <b>ball</b> blankets, such as evaporation control and odor control will be briefly discussed. Questions and answers of specific interest from conference attendees will be answered following the presentation. Various methods are available to industry to reduce open tank heating losses.

40|$|Objectives: Flow ball {{devices have}} been used as {{teaching}} tools to provide visual real-time feedback of airflow during singing. This study aims at exploring static back pressure and ball height as function of flow for two devices, marketed as flow <b>ball</b> and <b>floating</b> <b>ball</b> game. Study Design: This is a comparative descriptive study. Methods: A flow-driven vocal tract simulator was used to investigate the aerodynamic properties of these two devices, testing them for four different ball sizes. The flow range investigated was between 0 and 0. 5 [*]L/s. Audio, flow, pressure, and ball height were recorded. Results: The flow pressure profiles for both tested devices were similar to those observed in previous studies on narrow tubes. For lifting the ball, both devices had a flow and a pressure threshold. The tested <b>floating</b> <b>ball</b> game required considerably higher back pressure for a given flow as compared with the flow ball. Conclusions: Both tested devices have similar effects on back pressure as straws of 3. 7 and 3. 0 [*]mm in diameter for the flow <b>ball</b> and the <b>floating</b> <b>ball</b> game, respectively. One might argue that both devices could be used as tools for practicing semi-occluded vocal tract exercises, with the additional benefit of providing real-time visual feedback of airflow during phonation. The flow threshold, combined with the flow feedback, would increase awareness of flow, rather than of pressure, during exercises using a flow ball device...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: We {{analyzed}} the smoke plume produced by various energy-based laparoscopic instruments and de-termined {{its effect on}} laparoscopic visibility. Materials and Methods: The Bipolar Macroforceps, Harmonic Scalpel, <b>Floating</b> <b>Ball,</b> and Monopolar Shears were applied in vitro to porcine psoas muscle. An Aerodynamic Particle Sizer and Electrostatic Classifier pro-vided a size distribution of the plume for particles 500 nm and 500 nm, and a geometric mean particle size was calculated. A Condensation Particle Counter provided the total particle-number concentration. Elec-tron microscopy was used to characterize particle size and shape further. Visibility was calculated using the measured-size distribution data and the Rayleigh and Mie light-scattering theories. Results: The real-time instruments were successful in measuring aerosolized particle size distributions in two size ranges. Electron microscopy revealed smaller, homogeneous, spherical particles and larger, irregu-lar particles consistent with cellular components. The aerosol produced by the Bipolar Macroforceps obscured visibility the least (relative visibility 0. 887) among the instruments tested. Particles from the Harmonic Scalpel resulted in a relative visibility of 0. 801. Monopolar-based instruments produced plumes responsible for the poorest relative visibility (<b>Floating</b> <b>Ball</b> 0. 252; Monopolar Shears 0. 026). Conclusions: Surgical smoke is composed of two distinct particle populations caused by the nucleation of vapors as they cool (the small particles) and the entrainment of tissue secondary to mechanical aspects (the large particles). High concentrations of small particles are most responsible for the deterioration in laparo-scopic vision. Bipolar and ultrasonic instruments generate a surgical plume that causes the least deteriora-tion of visibility among the instruments tested...|$|R

40|$|Capillary {{phenomena}} {{have been}} studied by mathematicians and physicists for hundreds of years. In this thesis, both two-dimensional(2 D) and three-dimensional(3 D) bodies floating on an unbounded reservoir are studied based on the Young-Laplace equation. We reconsider the 2 D floating cylinder problem studied in a groundbreaking paper of Bhatnargar and Finn from 2006. We derive the total energy relative to the undisturbed state and the total force in vertical direction. The relation between the total force and the derivative of the total energy {{with respect to the}} height of the centre of the cylinder relative to the undisturbed fluid level is found. The number of equilibria, the floating configurations and their stability are also studied. In the 2 D floating square problem, we rederive the floating configurations and their stability in the no surface tension case. Allowing surface tension, one example with a special contact angle is considered. We show that there is one unstable equilibrium of the floating square with a horizontal side. In the 3 D floating object problem with radial symmetry, the shooting method is applied to obtain the fluid height and radial distance from the vertical axis numerically in terms of the inclination angle parameter. In the vertical cylinder problem, the relation between the total energy and the total force in vertical direction is found to be consistent with 2 D cylinder case. In the <b>floating</b> <b>ball</b> problem, a non-monotone relation between height of centre and the wetting angle is found. We also give an example of two floating configurations with the same height. More study of the 3 D <b>floating</b> <b>ball</b> problem is anticipated. ...|$|R
