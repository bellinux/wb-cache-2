5|$|Australia {{received}} a fire-control director sometime between mid-1915 and May 1916; this centralised fire control under the director officer, who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely {{had to follow}} pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> spot the fall of shells and eliminated {{the problem of the}} ship's roll dispersing the shells when each turret fired independently. Australia was also fitted with an additional inch of armour around the midships turrets following the Battle of Jutland.|$|E
5|$|Lion {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised the pointing and firing {{of the guns}} {{under the command of}} the director positioned on the foremast. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers controlled by the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells as each turret fired individually.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} Smart's eclipse may be traced {{in part to}} a {{prejudice}} of the age, one which was founded in reason but developed in fear. There was one inescapable fact which hampered any clear perception of Smart's work—he had been confined for madness. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> use a difficult allusion or unusual image as evidence of madness than to interpret it. What could cause a fundamentally rational group of people to react so irrationally? To some degree, it was the fear of 'enthusiasm'.|$|E
5|$|Because of his father's background, Thakkar's {{early years}} in India were spent around actors. During these initial years, Thakkar worked with his father for some time in Mumbai, {{contributing}} to a 1971 Films Division of India documentary, and playing parts in television and radio shows. Thakkar also worked as a voice-over artist for television advertisements. At the same time, Thakkar's interest in mathematics and science remained predominant. Later on, {{he moved to the}} United States as he believed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> make visual effects movies in Hollywood. Currently, Thakkar stays with his wife and family in Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Chetro Ketl's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} using three bulk materials: stone, clay-sand, and water. Two types of stone were used: a hard gray-brown tabular sandstone {{that forms the}} bench above Chaco Canyon's cliffs, and a softer, tan, massively bedded sandstone that forms the cliffs themselves. Chacoans preferred the harder, tabular stone as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> shape, but much of {{it had to be}} dug up and levered out of the ground with wooden poles. Because the massive tan stone of the cliff faces was easier to procure, but much more difficult to work, the Chacoans probably used it only after the more easily quarried gray-brown stone beds had been depleted.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} two decades after the {{founding}} of the empire, Harihara I gained control over most of the area south of the Tungabhadra river and earned the title of Purvapaschima Samudradhishavara ("master of the eastern and western seas"). By 1374 Bukka Raya I, successor to Harihara I, had defeated the chiefdom of Arcot, the Reddys of Kondavidu, and the Sultan of Madurai and had gained control over Goa in the west and the Tungabhadra-Krishna River doab in the north. The original capital was in the principality of Anegondi on the northern banks of the Tungabhadra River in today's Karnataka. It was later moved to nearby Vijayanagara on the river's southern banks during the reign of Bukka Raya I, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> defend against the Muslim armies persistently attacking it from the northern lands.|$|E
5|$|Sega AM2's {{first attempt}} in the genre was the 1993 arcade game Burning Rival, but gained renown {{with the release}} of Virtua Fighter for the same {{platform}} the same year. It was the first fighting game with 3D polygon graphics and a viewpoint that zoomed and rotated with the action. Despite the graphics, players were confined to back and forth motion as seen in other fighting games. With only three buttons, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> learn than Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, having six and five buttons respectively. By the time the game was released for the Sega Saturn in Japan, the game and system were selling at almost a one-to-one ratio.|$|E
5|$|As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> {{raise money}} for medical purposes, {{particularly}} cancer treatment, than for nuclear physics, Lawrence encouraged {{the use of the}} cyclotron for medical research. Working with his brother John and Israel Lyon Chaikoff from the University of California's Physiology Department, Lawrence supported research into the use of radioactive isotopes for therapeutic purposes. Phosphorus-32 was easily produced in the cyclotron, and John used it to cure a woman afflicted with polycythemia vera, a blood disease. John used phosphorus-32 created in the 37-inch cyclotron in 1938 in tests on mice with leukemia. He found that the radioactive phosphorus concentrated in the fast-growing cancer cells. This then led to clinical trials on human patients. A 1948 evaluation of the therapy showed that remissions occurred under certain circumstances. Lawrence also had hoped for the medical use of neutrons. The first cancer patient received neutron therapy from the 60-inch cyclotron on November 20. Chaikoff conducted trials on the use of radioactive isotopes as radioactive tracers to explore the mechanism of biochemical reactions.|$|E

5|$|The censors {{were the}} magistrates who {{enforced}} the ethical {{standards of the}} Senate. Whenever a censor punished a senator, they had to allege some specific failing. Possible reasons for punishing a member included corruption, abuse of capital punishment, or the disregard of a colleague's veto, constitutional precedent, or the auspices. Senators who failed to obey various laws could also be punished. While punishment could include impeachment (expulsion) from the Senate, often a punishment was less severe than outright expulsion. While the standard was high for expelling a member from the Senate, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> deny a citizen the right to join the Senate. Various moral failings could result in one not being allowed to join the Senate, including bankruptcy, prostitution, or a prior history of having been a gladiator. One law (the Lex repetundarum of 123 BC) made it illegal for a citizen to become a senator {{if they had been}} convicted of a criminal offense. Many of these laws were enacted in the last century of the Republic, as public corruption began reaching unprecedented levels.|$|E
5|$|Dearly Stars sold 30,786 {{copies in}} its first week of release in Japan, and ranked as the tenth best-selling video game in Japan that week. The game {{received}} a score of 30 out of 40 from the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu. Critics have described Dearly Stars as suitable for beginners to the Idolmaster series for drawing out the series' essence and reorganizing it into a simpler and easier-to-understand form. At the same time, Famitsu reviewer Sekai Sandai Miyokawa thinks that fans of the series will feel from Dearly Stars {{the growth of the}} 765 Pro idols and the overall growth of the series. Reviewers note that despite the change in the game's details compared to previous games in the series, such as the change in perspective from the producer to the idol, Dearly Stars still plays like an Idolmaster game. However, another Famitsu reviewer stated that because other aspects of the gameplay in Dearly Stars are similar to previous Idolmaster games such as doing lessons and auditions, the sense of enjoyment is not that different from other games. A reviewer for Famitsu felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> empathize with an idol when the story was told from their perspective.|$|E
