50|$|A <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> is {{a medical}} device used to provide {{nutrition}} to patients who cannot obtain nutrition by mouth, are unable to swallow safely, or need nutritional supplementation.

Significant complications due to nasojejunal <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> placement, such as hydrothorax, duodenal perforation and retroperitoneal emphysema, are very rare. We present a case of massive retroperitoneal emphysema and abscess because of duodenal perforation caused by a kink in a nasojejunal <b>feeding</b> <b>tube.</b> Case presentation A 34 -year-old Chinese woman was admitted to our intensive care unit due to hypertriglyceridemia and severe acute pancreatitis. As she suffered from acute respiratory distress syndrome and required mechanical ventilation, a nasojejunal <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> was placed by transnasal endoscopic technique. The procedure took place at her bedside. Half a month later, she had a high fever and abdominal distension. An abdominal radiography was performed and showed that the nasojejunal <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> was kinking on the third portion of the duodenum and the tip of the nasojejunal <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> was inserted into the right retroperitoneum on the second portion of the duodenum.

5000|$|SP-8 {{internals}} {{are identical}} to those of an Ion, with a few minor differences. First, the SP-8's regulator is canted 15 degrees forward; the Ion's is vertical. The SP-8's pressure gauge is mounted on the right, unlike the Ion (and almost all other markers) which has the gauge on the left. The SP-8 ships with a straight [...] "blade" [...] trigger, while the Ion has a curved [...] "wave" [...] trigger. Finally, the SP-8's breech section is drilled for a right-hand <b>feed</b> <b>tube</b> (so that top-mounted accessories such as scopes will not be blocked by the <b>feed</b> <b>tube</b> or hopper), while the Ion is set up for traditional vertical feed. The SP-8 is thus forced to use a plastic 45-degree elbow adapter to mount a hopper, which (because it is prone to frequent breakage) is a criticized feature. The Ion, by contrast, has a threaded vertical feed port that accepts all standard Impulse-threaded feednecks.

40|$|Abstract — Drug therapy may be {{complicated}} in hospitalized patients receiving nutrition via enteral <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes.</b> Dosage form selection and appropriate administration methods are crucial {{in patients with}} <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes.</b> Although hospitalized patients receive nutritional support through various routes, oral nutrition is preferred. Enteral or parenteral nutrition may be used if oral intake is inadequate or inadvisable. Patients with functional gastrointestinal tracts usually receive enteral nutrition. Administering oral medications through the enteral <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> can lead to complications like tube clogging or decreased drug activity. However, drug therapy need not be compromised in patients receiving enteral nutrition. Careful selection and preparation of dosage forms reduces the complications of medication administration. Flushing the <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> and screening for drug incompatibilities decreases the incidence of tube clogging and replacement.

40|$|Background: Gastroparesis {{is common}} in {{surgical}} patients and frequently leads {{to the need for}} enteral <b>tube</b> <b>feeding.</b> Nasoenteral <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> are usually placed endoscopically by gastroenterologists, but this procedure is relatively cumbersome for patients and labor-intensive for hospital staff. Electromagnetic (EM) guided bedside placement of nasoenteral <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> by nurses may reduce patient discomfort, workload and costs, but randomized studies are lacking, especially in surgical patients. We hypothesize that EM guided bedside placement of nasoenteral <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> is at least as effective as endoscopic placement in surgical patients, at lower costs. Methods/Design: The CORE trial is an investigator-initiated, parallel-group, pragmatic, multicenter randomized controlled non-inferiority trial. A total of 154 patients admitted to gastrointestinal surgical wards in five hospitals, requiring nasoenteral feeding, will be randomly allocated to undergo EM guided or endoscopic nasoenteral <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> placement. Primary outcome is reinsertion of the <b>feeding</b> <b>tube,</b> defined as the insertion of an endoscope or tube in the nose/mouth and esophagus for (re) placement of the <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> (e. g. after failed initial placement or dislodgement or blockage of the tube). Secondary outcomes include patient-reported outcomes, costs and tube (placement) related complications. Discussion: The CORE trial is designed to generate evidence on the effectiveness of EM guided placement of nasoenteral <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> in surgical patients and the impact on costs as compared to endoscopic placement.

50|$|Force-feed hoppers use an {{impeller}} to capture paintballs and force {{them into the}} marker.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The early {{institution}} of feeding {{in patients who}} need postpyloric <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> is often hampered by a limited availability of endoscopists experienced in safe tube positioning. OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility of having nurses place postpyloric <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> by using a universal path finding system device. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Academic hospital. PATIENTS: The success rate and learning curve of a senior nurse placing postpyloric <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> in 50 patients was studied, followed by a study in 160 patients on the success rates and learning curves of 4 inexperienced nurses instructed by the senior nurse. Finally, the success rate of postpyloric <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> placement by the senior nurse in 50 critically ill patients was investigated. INTERVENTION: Postpyloric <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> positioning by nurses using an electromagnetic universal path-finding system device enabling them to follow {{the path of the}} tip of the <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> on a monitor screen. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Success was defined by postpyloric positioning of the <b>feeding</b> <b>tube.</b> The ultimate aim was to reach at least the duodenojejunal flexure. RESULTS: In the first part, the senior nurse was successful in 72 % of cases. There was a clear learning curve. In the second part, the 4 newly instructed nurses had a success rate of 89. 4 % without an evident learning curve. In the third part, successful <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> positioning was achieved in 78 % of critically ill patients. Of the 217 successfully positioned tubes, 74 % reached at least the duodenojejunal flexure. In half of the unsuccessful cases, an explanation for the failure was found at endoscopy. No complications were seen. LIMITATIONS: The generalization to less-specialized hospitals should be investigated.
