In later despatches Jervis did mention Nelson. In one anecdote, when discussing the battle with his flag-captain, Sir Robert, who had been mentioned in the despatch and had been awarded a knighthood for his services, brought up the issue of Nelson's disobedience of the admiral's orders for having worn out of the line of battle in order to engage the enemy. Jervis silenced him by saying: [...] "It certainly was so, and if you ever commit such a breach of your orders, I will <b>forgive</b> <b>you</b> also." ...|$|E
500|$|By February 1671, John Churchill {{was back}} in London and duelling with Sir John Fenwick. Churchill's {{handsome}} features and manner – described by Lord Chesterfield as [...] "irresistible to either man or woman" [...] – had soon attracted the ravenous attentions {{of one of the}} King's most noteworthy mistresses, Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland. But his liaisons with the insatiable temptress were indeed dangerous. One account has it that upon the King's appearance Churchill leapt out of his lover's bed and hid in the cupboard, but the King, himself wily in such matters, soon discovered young Churchill, who promptly fell to his knees. [...] "You are a rascal", said Charles, [...] "but I <b>forgive</b> <b>you</b> because you do it to get your bread". The story may be apocryphal – another version has Churchill jumping out of the window – but it is widely accepted that he was the father of Cleveland's daughter, Barbara, born on 16 July 1672 (O.S.). However, Churchill never formally acknowledged her.|$|E

500|$|The character's {{accidental}} pregnancy storyline received {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Tim Stack for Entertainment Weekly deemed it [...] "a good dramatic twist", but hoped {{that it would}} not be a long-lasting storyline. Reviews of her storyline became increasingly negative, though Agron was praised for her dramatic acting during the confrontation scene with Quinn's parents in [...] "Ballad". Gerrick D. Kennedy, writing for the Los Angeles Times, was critical of the ongoing pregnancy plot in the episode [...] "Hairography", and noted that he cringed whenever Quinn appeared on screen. Conversely, Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle enjoyed Quinn in the episode, and wrote: [...] "I love that she can keep her Mean Girls edge while being heartbreakingly sad or as joyful as she was singing [...] "Papa Don't Preach". Reviewing the episode [...] "Journey to Regionals", Entertainment Weekly's Darren Franich called Quinn's birthing scenes—interspersed with Vocal Adrenaline performing Queen's [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody"—both [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "terrible". He wrote, [...] "If nothing else, it was definitely the most visually arresting way to represent the birthing process I've ever seen outside of The Miracle of Life. But I kind of liked it. Somewhere, Freddie Mercury is nodding proudly, and saying, 'World, I <b>forgive</b> <b>you</b> for We Will Rock You.'" ...|$|E

[...] As the king and his family watched in secret, the charges against the plotters were read aloud. [...] Alone amongst them Digby pleaded [...] "Guilty", and was tried on a separate indictment. [...] Dressed in a black satin suit and [...] "tuff taffetie gown", he gave a short and moving speech, defending his actions by explaining his affection for Catesby, and the cause of his religion. [...] He accused King James of reneging on his promises of toleration for Catholics, and told of his fears of harsher laws against recusancy. [...] He also pleaded on behalf of his family, that they should not pay for his actions, before making a final request to be beheaded. [...] His words fell on mostly deaf ears. [...] The prosecution poured scorn on James's supposed perfidy, and ridiculed Digby for asking for leniency where he would have given none. [...] Along with the other plotters, he was found guilty. [...] As they were led from the hall, Digby exclaimed: [...] "If I may but hear any of your lordships say, you forgive me, I shall go more cheerfully to the gallows."

[...] Rookwood claimed that he had been drawn into the plot by Catesby, [...] "whom he loved above any worldy man". [...] Thomas Wintour begged to be hanged for himself and his brother, so that his brother might be spared. [...] Fawkes explained his not guilty plea as ignorance of certain aspects of the indictment. [...] Keyes appeared to accept his fate, Bates and Robert Wintour begged for mercy, and Grant explained his involvement as [...] "a conspiracy intended but never effected". [...] Only Digby, tried on a separate indictment, pleaded guilty, insisting that the King had reneged upon promises of toleration for Catholics, and that affection for Catesby and love of the Catholic cause mitigated his actions. [...] He sought death by the axe and begged mercy from the King for his young family. [...] His defence was in vain; his arguments were rebuked by Coke and Northumberland, and along with his seven co-conspirators, he was found guilty by the jury of high treason. [...] Digby shouted [...] "If I may but hear any of your lordships say, you forgive me, I shall go more cheerfully to the gallows." [...] The response was short: [...] "God <b>forgive</b> <b>you,</b> and we do." ...|$|E
500|$|At Fotheringhay on {{the evening}} of 7 February 1587, Mary was told that she was to be {{executed}} the next morning. She spent the last hours of her life in prayer, distributing her belongings to her household, and writing her will and a letter to the King of France. The scaffold that was erected in the Great Hall was two feet high and draped in black. It was reached by two or three steps and furnished with the block, a cushion for her to kneel on and three stools, for her and the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, who were there to witness the execution. The executioners (one named Bull and his assistant) knelt before her and asked forgiveness, as it was typical for the executioner to ask the pardon of the one being put to death. She replied, [...] "I <b>forgive</b> <b>you</b> with all my heart, for now, I hope, you shall make an end of all my troubles." [...] Her servants, Jane Kennedy and Elizabeth Curle, and the executioners helped Mary to remove her outer garments, revealing a velvet petticoat and a pair of sleeves in crimson-brown, the liturgical colour of martyrdom in the Catholic Church, with a black satin bodice and black trimmings. As she disrobed she smiled and said that she [...] "never had such grooms before... nor ever put off her clothes before such a company". She was blindfolded by Kennedy with a white veil embroidered in gold, knelt down on the cushion in front of the block, on which she positioned her head, and stretched out her arms. Her last words were, [...] "In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum" [...] ("Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit").|$|E
