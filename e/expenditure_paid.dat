In terms of treatment expenditure, our results indicate that hospitals facing more competition incur higher expenditures, either the short- or long-term expenditure.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers the}} conceptual interaction between section 23 M and section 31 of the Income Tax Act, 1962. Both sections limit tax deductible interest <b>expenditure</b> <b>paid</b> to non-resident related persons based on specific requirements. The dissertation establishes the ambit of each section {{by relying on}} an interpretive guide, which takes into account three aspects of interpretation. These three aspects are: the ordinary grammatical meaning of the words comprising each section; the contextual understanding of each section; {{and the purpose of}} each section. The dissertation determines that there is an overlap in the ambit of section 23 M and section 31 in respect of the taxpayer to which each section applies, interest as determined for purposes of the common law and the purpose of each section, being to prevent tax base erosion through excessive interest rate deductions. Despite the presence of an overlap, a taxpayer falling within the ambit of both sections is always limited to a deduction equal to the smaller answer yielded by section 23 M or section 31. However, in respect of the carry-forward in section 23 M(4) there is uncertainty as to the calculation of the carry-forward. The dissertation recommends an amendment to section 23 M(4) to clarify the calculation of the carry-forward amount. In the absence of a carry-forward, the dissertation determines that a possible interpretational solution may be to calculate the carry-forward with reference to actual interest expenditure and to subject any deduction in respect of an amount carried forward to section 31 in the year of assessment during which a deduction is claimed.

40|$|This thesis conducts {{positive}} and normative analysis of inequality based on human capital theory. In Chapter 2, we document important differences in early child investments by family income and study four leading mechanisms thought to explain these gaps: intergenerational ability correlation, consumption value of investment, information frictions, and credit constraints. We evaluate whether these mechanisms {{are consistent with}} other stylized facts related to the marginal returns on investments {{and the effects of}} parental income on child investments and skills. In Chapter 3, I study optimal higher education subsidies when parents’ willingness to pay for their children 2 ̆ 7 s education differs due to heterogeneity in altruism. I first document substantial heterogeneity in the fraction of college <b>expenditure</b> <b>paid</b> by parents across families and provide evidence that this heterogeneity can be explained by parental altruism. Then I analytically characterize optimal education subsidies when the social planner minimizes distortions generated by borrowing constraints and can observe neither the amount of parental transfers nor parental altruism. I show that redistributing towards constrained students of low altruism parents is socially beneficial, but it involves substantial deadweight loss. The calibrated model suggests that the deadweight loss due to unobservable heterogeneity in parental altruism can be quantitatively large and therefore limit redistribution towards students with low parental transfers. In Chapter 4, we study the role of returns to unobserved skills in the rising residual earnings inequality for the past few decades in the U. S. We identify and estimate a general model of earnings residuals that incorporates (i) changing returns to unobserved skills, (ii) changing distribution of unobserved skills, and (iii) changing volatility of earnings that is not related to skills. Using data from the PSID, we find that the returns to unobserved skills went down since the mid- 1980 s despite the steady increase in the residual inequality. Using a simple demand and supply framework, we show that both demand and supply factors contributed to the downward trend in the returns to skills over time...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesBackground: Pharmaceuticals are {{responsible}} for a substantial {{percentage of the total}} cost of health care and continue to exceed economic growth and inflation. Generic medicines {{play an important role in}} limiting this expenditure, and consequently there is an international drive to implement pro - generic policies particularly in high income countries. One such policy is generic medicine reference pricing (GRP). Generic reference pricing sets a fixed maximum reimbursement amount for clusters of bio - equivalent drugs without placing any restrictions on the manufacturers' price. Numerous studies have been conducted in high income countries to analyse the impact of generic reference pricing; however, the impact of this reference pricing in low - to - middle income countries (LMIC s) is not well established. Objective: This dissertation aims to address this lack of information in LMICs by providing empirical aggregated claims data on the impact of generic reference pricing on price, expenditure, utilisation and out - of - pocket (OOP) p ayments in a sector of South Africa's private health insurance industry. Methods: This time series intervention study of retrospective claim - level secondary data analyses the impact of one of several generic reference pricing models applied by various private medical insurance companies in South Africa. Criteria applied for the selection of referenced categories and sample claims data intend to maximize the data set as well as the analysis period, while minimizing confounders such as medical insurance member variation and specific managed care policies. The impact of the reference price on variables of drug price, drug expenditure, market share and out - of - pock et payment is measured by analysing changes in the originator, 'authorised generic' ('clone') and generic drugs within each cluster. (An 'authorised generic' (AG) is an exact copy of the originator, approved as a brand - name drug under a patent protection but marketed as a generic.) Results: Two referenced priced categories (Desloratadine and Clopidogrel) and a population of approximately 100, 000 were identified as being eligible for inclusion. An authorised generic was launched for Clopidogrel but not for Desloratadine. The implementation of generic reference pricing appears to have had no or minimal impact on the price of the originator and authorised generic - at the end of the study period the price of the originator drugs of the two categories was 268 % and 86 % higher than the reference and the authorised generic of Clopidogrel was 69 % higher than the reference price. Most often the reference price appeared to be based on the price of a generic drug; however once the reference price was set other generics tended to align at or below the reference price. The implementation of generic reference pricing was associated with an overall increase in dispensed volumes and a decrease in expenditure for both categories; both categories' originator market share declined dramatically by volume (to 23 % and 4 %) and value (to 35 % and 9 %). For Clopidogrel the authorised generic took the majority of market share (63 % by volume and 68 % by value); the generics only gained one third of the market, despite lower product prices and minimal co - payments. Desloratadine generics captured 80 % of the market by the end of the study. For both categories there was no notable change in the total drug <b>expenditure</b> <b>paid</b> out - of - pocket across the study period. The percentage of drugs dispensed that had a co - payment decreased dramatically for Desloratadine, but were only seen to decrease marginally for Clopidogrel. Limitations: Due to the small sample and limited reference categories analysed, the findings from this study are not representative of the South African private healthcare sector and cannot be extrapolated to South Africa. In addition, any savings identified should take the expense of non - referenced alternatives into account...|$|E
2500|$|The {{backlash}} included vocal critics, including disgruntled {{patients and}} consumer-advocacy groups, {{who argued that}} managed care plans were controlling costs by denying medically necessary services to patients, even in life-threatening situations, or by providing low-quality care. The volume of criticism led many states to pass laws mandating managed-care standards.

Thus, an NPO should consider their social accountability toward their wide-ranging stakeholders. However, {{it is difficult for}} NPOs, which provide free or low-charge services with numerous volunteers, to accurately estimate inputs and outputs for social values which are not included on income statements. Therefore, we focus on the social accounting method to calculate an NPO’s invisible social costs and benefits by using the concept of market values and replacement costs. Additionally, we tried, as a case study, to prepare the social value statement of a nonprofit bank, Community Youth Bank Momo, which collects funds {{from a wide range of}} citizens and uses them to provide loans for community-based activities. As a result, it was found that total inputs including volunteer activities and out-of-pocket expenses reached to five-times the actual <b>expenditures</b> <b>paid.</b> However, issues still remain with the application of social accounting to various NPO activities and the calculation of rational market values. 収支計算をベースとする従来の財務会計では，資金拠出者に対するアカウンタビリティを果たすに過ぎず，社会活動に取り組む非営利組織がミッションを果たしたことを適切に表すことができない. そのため，幅広い利害関係者に対する社会的アカウンタビリティを意識すべきであるが，多くのボランティアが参加して無償・低償サービスを提供する団体では，収支計算書に表れない社会価値を取り込まなければ正しい資源の投入量や成果の産出量を測定できない. そこで我々は，市場価格や代替費用の概念を用いてこれらの社会費用・便益を計算し，非営利組織が持つ見えない社会価値を顕在化させるソーシャル・アカウンティングの手法を検討した. さらに事例研究として，広く市民から出資金を集めて地域活動への融資に取り組むNPOバンク(コミュニティ・ユース・バンクmomo) の社会価値計算書を作成したところ，ボランティアによる役務提供や自己負担経費を含めれば，実際の支出額に対して 5 倍の資源が活動に投入されていることが判明した. 今後，多様な活動分野に対するソーシャル・アカウンティングの活用方法や，合理的な市場価格の算定方法についてさらに検討を進めたい...|$|R

40|$|While {{the overall}} {{percentage}} of unused antiretroviral medicines {{returned to the}} hospital pharmacy is low, their cost is quite high. Adverse events, treatment failure, pharmacokinetic interactions, pregnancy, or treatment simplification are common reasons for unplanned treatment changes. Socially inefficient antiretroviral packages prevent the reuse of drugs returned to the hospital pharmacy. We defined antiretroviral package categories based on the excellence of drug packaging and analyzed the number of pills and costs of drugs returned {{during a period of}} 1 year in a hospital-based HIV unit attending to 2, 413 treated individuals. A total of 6, 090 pills (34 % of all returned antiretrovirals) - with a cost of 47, 139. 91 € - would be totally lost, mainly due to being packed up in the lowest efficiency packages. Newer treatments are packaged in low-excellence categories of packages, thus favoring the maintenance of these hidden costs in the near future. Therefore, costs of this low-efficiency drug packaging, where medication packages are started but not completed, in high-cost medications are substantial and should be properly addressed. Any improvement in the packaging by the manufacturer, and favoring the choice of drugs supplied through efficient packages (when efficacy, toxicity, and convenience are similar), should minimize the treatment <b>expenditures</b> <b>paid</b> by national health budgets...|$|R
