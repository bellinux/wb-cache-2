Thousands of people blocked Boylston Street in a <b>die-in</b> along the Boston Common. A handful of arrests were made. In the UK hundreds of protesters marched from Cowley into the centre of Oxford and thousands took to the streets of Edinburgh (Police estimated 5,000, while organizers estimated more than 10,000). Edinburgh protesters marched along Princes Street to a mass rally in the city's Meadows area.|$|E

25|$|Petrelis later faced {{criticism}} {{for his actions}} inside the cathedral. By standing on a pew, blowing a whistle, and screaming, while the other protesters inside the church participated in silent <b>die-ins</b> or read prepared statements, Petrelis had angered other protesters as well as outsiders and established his early {{reputation as one of}} ACT UP's more radical members.|$|R
2500|$|Between 30–45 cities held {{peaceful}} protests, {{though a}} couple events saw minor altercations. In Amarillo, Texas, demonstrators gathered outside city hall, then marched from downtown {{to the local}} office of U.S. Representative Mac Thornberry, a Republican representing Texas's 13th congressional district. The event was organized by Rusty Tomlinson and the High Plains Circle of Non-Violence, and finished with a <b>die-in</b> {{in support of the}} [...] "99% of Americans either victimized or exploited by the Trump Regime". The protest in Ann Arbor, Michigan was organized by the group Stop Trump Ann Arbor, and drew an estimated 100–150 demonstrators. They gathered at The Diag on the University of Michigan campus and marched to Liberty Plaza. In Atlanta, around 50 protesters marched from Piedmont Park to Centennial Olympic Park.|$|E
2500|$|Despite their {{inclusion}} of a women to speak about rights for trans women, and adding to the program an opportunity for Black Lives Matter supporters to stage a <b>die-in,</b> the original organizers were criticized for not addressing issues of diversity. Online arguing resulted in moderators removing personal attacks and other comments. The conflict was not unique to Portland: Eugene resident Constance Van Flandern, serving as Oregon's [...] "official liaison" [...] to the national Women's March on Washington, was told similar disputes were taking place in cities throughout the United States. Moore attributed the disagreements to [...] "how different generations view feminism". Similarly, Rachel Monahan of Willamette Week commented, [...] "The conflict in Portland reflected strife that also occurred among national women's march planners. An older generation of feminists disagreed with younger activists about whether there could be unity on women's issues without reference to discrimination against racial, ethnic and sexual identities." ...|$|E
2500|$|In San Francisco, California protests {{occurred}} {{throughout the}} day and {{in different parts of}} the city with up to 150 people arrested for misdemeanors such as trespassing, resisting arrest and blocking an intersection. Part of the success of the group coordinating named Direct Action was due to utilizing smart mob technologies including text messaging, Google Maps, live video-feeds and internet radio updates. In contrast to the first-day protests in 2003 when the city was effectively shut down in many ways, the protests were focussed on specific targets and conveying messages – [...] "there's little point in barricading the Bay Bridge in a city where most people are against the war anyway." [...] In the morning, a group of 500 worked their way through the morning commute effectively tying-up traffic for hours as the police had to block, move and re-block streets and busses for the procession. The Federal Reserve Bank and Chevron Corporation were also targeted with actions and saw arrests. Starting around noon and lasting for several hours the most [...] "dramatic" [...] protests were a <b>die-in</b> – again blocking the main traffic artery, Market Street – directly in front of California Senator Dianne Feinstein's office. Feinstein supported the Iraq war resolution and subsequent supplemental appropriations bills although she has stated she was deceived by the Bush administration about the weapons of mass destruction. As police arrested dozens of protesters more would take their place. In the evening 7000 marched and rallied in front of San Francisco City Hall hearing speeches including Assemblywoman Carole Migden. Although mostly peaceful some police were pelted with glass Christmas ornaments filled with paint.|$|E
5|$|In August, BLM {{organizers}} held a {{rally in}} Washington, D.C., calling for a stop to violence against transgender women. In Charlotte, North Carolina, after a judge declared a mistrial {{in the trial of}} a white Charlotte police officer who killed an unarmed black man, Jonathan Ferrell, BLM protested and staged <b>die-ins.</b> In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Janelle Monáe, Jidenna, and other BLM activists marched through North Philadelphia to bring awareness to police brutality and Black Lives Matter. Around August 9, the first anniversary of Michael Brown's death, BLM rallied, held vigil and marched in St. Louis and across the country.|$|R
2500|$|On 22 August 1984, Johnson {{participated in}} a {{political}} demonstration called the [...] "Republican War Chest Tour" [...] in Dallas, Texas to protest the policies of several Dallas-area businesses and of the Ronald Reagan presidential administration. [...] The demonstration was timed {{to coincide with the}} 1984 Republican National Convention being held in downtown Dallas. During the demonstration, approximately one hundred protestors marched in the streets, chanted slogans, and staged anti-nuclear weapons and anti-war <b>die-ins</b> at various corporate offices. Some protestors vandalized businesses by spray-painting building walls and knocking over potted plants and ashtrays. Johnson did not take part in the vandalism, but took an American flag that had been seized from a flagpole at one of the buildings by another protestor.|$|R
50|$|The Encampment {{utilized}} {{a number}} of different techniques in their protests to bring their causes and issues {{to the attention of the}} outside world. They used many ritual elements. The women would protest in large circles, holding hands, and weave webs of yarn around each other and around the fence of the Army Depot, with objects of meaning also incorporated. They performed slow walks, where they would walk in slow-motion; twisting, turning, and pulling each other along. In one protest they tied themselves to the fence with ribbons and yarn, and moaned and screamed. Other demonstrations put on that summer featured singing, dancing, masks, costumes, makeup, and signs. Sometimes <b>die-ins</b> were performed, to imitate war casualties. There was even a laundry ritual, in which women hung up signs in a local laundromat while doing their laundry.|$|R
50|$|In the {{simplest}} {{form of a}} <b>die-in,</b> protesters simply {{lie down on the}} ground and pretend to be dead, sometimes covering themselves with signs or banners.

2500|$|Petrelis {{returned}} to New York City a year later, {{where he was}} one of 111 protesters arrested in a demonstration at St. Patrick's Cathedral on December 11, 1989. The demonstration was among ACT Up's most controversial, but Petrelis almost didn't participate; none of the other activists wanted to include him in their affinity groups for that demonstration because, he recalled, [...] "People felt I was too angry." [...] Petrelis said he nonetheless felt driven to go and changed his mind. Arriving early before the police had established barricades, Petrelis was able to enter the church, and sit on the aisle {{in the middle of the}} cathedral. As other protesters stage silent <b>die-ins,</b> or calmly read prepared statements, Petrelis stood on the pew and screamed, [...] "O'Connor, you're killing us! You're killing us, just stop it! Just stop it!" [...] Before officers removed him from the cathedral, Petrelis screamed, [...] "We will not be silent. We will fight O'Connor's bigotry." ...|$|R
25|$|In January 1988, ACT UP Boston {{held its}} first protest at the Boston offices of the Department of Health and Human Services, {{regarding}} delays and red tape surrounding approval of AIDS treatment drugs. ACT UP/Boston's agenda included demands for a compassionate and comprehensive national policy on AIDS; a national emergency AIDS project; intensified drug testing, research, and treatment efforts; and a full-scale national educational program within reach of all. The organization held <b>die-ins</b> and sleep-ins, provided freshman orientation for Harvard Medical School students, negotiated successfully with a major pharmaceutical corporation, affected state and national AIDS polices, pressured health care insurers to provide coverage for people with AIDS, influenced the thinking {{of some of the}} nation's most influential researchers, served on the Massachusetts committee that created the nation's first online registry of clinical trials for AIDS treatments, distributed information and condoms to the congregation at Cardinal Bernard Francis Law Confirmation Sunday services at Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Boston, and made aerosolized pentamidine an accessible treatment in New England.|$|R
5000|$|After the Staten Island {{grand jury}} did not indict Pantaleo on December 3, {{citizens}} in New York City and San Francisco gathered in protest, demonstrating with several <b>die-ins,</b> making speeches and rallies against the indictment. On December 5, thousands gathered in protest on the Boston Common in Boston, and then marched {{in the downtown}} area, blocking traffic, especially on I-90, in addition to staging [...] "die-ins." [...] Protests also occurred in Chicago, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Minneapolis, and Atlanta. At least 300 people were arrested at the New York City protests on December 4 and 5, most of them for charges of disorderly conduct or refusal to clear the streets, but two for assault on a police officer. On December 6, 300 protesters marched in Berkeley, California as well. On December 10, 76 protesters were arrested at Westfield shopping centre in Shepherd's Bush in west London, England, during a rally to show solidarity with rallies in the United States. Protesters have made use of Garner's last words, [...] "I can't breathe", as a slogan and chant against police brutality since Garner's death and Officer Pantaleo's grand jury decision. By December 28, at least 50 protests in support of Garner had occurred globally, and many other Black Lives Matter-related demonstrations had occurred.|$|R

5000|$|On March 9, 1977, Peck protested North Carolina Governor James Hunt at a New York City Symphony Orchestra {{because the}} Governor refused to {{intervene}} in the notorious international case of the Wilmington 10. On March 18, 1978 Peck joined 8,000 people in a march on the White House to free the Wilmington 10. On April 5, 1979, Peck joined a night vigil against the scheduled Alabama execution of John Louis Evans, which ended in celebration when the judge granted a last minute reprieve. On August 11, 1979, Peck was one of 66 demonstrators arrested for violating a court order by attempting to cross a bridge in Reidsville, Georgia, in order to reach Georgia State Prison on the other side. Peck was arrested there along with Dick Gregory to show support for the [...] "Reidsville Six," [...] who were accused of starting a prison riot the year before. On November 23, 1979, Peck was one of 24 persons arrested at a protest against capital punishment at the Supreme Court building in D.C., sponsored by People Against Execution (PAX). The rally was called [...] "Florida Day" [...] to represent the more than 100 prisoners facing the death penalty in the state. A series of [...] "mock executions" [...] were conducted upon the 24 people risking arrest, who sat in a hand-made electric chair and pretended to be executed. The 24 bodies were carried across the street and placed {{on the steps of the}} Supreme Court, where they performed <b>die-ins</b> until their arrests.|$|R
5000|$|On March 19, 1970, Peck {{was one of}} 182 demonstrators {{arrested for}} obstructing {{government}} operations at Manhattan's Armed Forces Examining & Entrance Station, during nationwide, decentralized protests against the war. Peck was arrested that day along with draft file burner Jerry Elmer, who later recorded the arrest in his book Felon for Peace: The Memoir of a Vietnam-Era Draft Resister. On April 24, 1971, Peck joined the massive march on Washington that over 750,000 persons took part in. On May 3, {{the first day of}} the May Day demonstrations in D.C., Peck was arrested along with 7,200 demonstrators in the single largest mass arrest in history, ending with over 13,000 arrested between May 3 and May 5. On October 26, he was arrested at the [...] "Evict Nixon" [...] protest in Washington, D.C., along with nearly 300 persons. He was arrested again outside the White House with 104 other demonstrators on November 9, during the two-week [...] "Daily Death Toll" [...] demonstrations, where activists performed <b>die-ins</b> to dramatize the continuation of Vietnamese deaths from American bombing. Peck was arrested again in D.C. on April 15, 1972, for performing a sit-down that resulted in 240 arrests. On May 22, Peck was among 224 demonstrators arrested for performing civil disobedience during the [...] "People's Blockade" [...] at the Pentagon. On June 10, Peck was arrested in New Jersey with 36 other demonstrators for being involved in the [...] "People's Blockade" [...] campaign that was conducted at navy ship yards to prevent ammunition from being sent to Vietnam. In August 1972, Peck was injured by a tear gas canister hitting him above the eye and was hospitalized during an anti-war rally in Miami at the Republican National Convention.|$|R
40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{governments of}} migrant sending and {{receiving}} countries, policy institutes, the United Nations and allied international financial institutions, and migration {{researchers in the}} academy have shown a heightened interest in the role that diasporas can play {{in the development of}} the Global South. As government responsibility to social welfare recedes and as humanitarian aid shrinks, these stakeholders have looked toward the wealth offered by diasporas. The resultant discourse of diaspora and development, the dissertation argues, is changing the meaning of the discursive construction of 2 ̆ 2 diaspora 2 ̆ 2 in its articulation with the concurrent construct of 2 ̆ 2 development 2 ̆ 2. This presents scholars with new challenges in studying diaspora and transnationalism. The expansion of who gets to be counted as diaspora and its articulation with newly extended diasporic citizenship limits the nature of citizenship to the performative and to the exclusive domain of giving. Accordingly, the study examines the communicate and relational practices of Association for India 2 ̆ 7 s Development (AID), a 1000 -volunteer-strong migrant Indian non-profit organization in the United States, to critique and expand the diaspora and development discourse. Through an extended case study of AID 2 ̆ 7 s practice and performance of citizenship, this study makes contributions to theories about the space of `home 2 ̆ 7 and its relation to the practice of politics; migrant presence and performance of citizenship in the Global North; diasporic interventions in the discourse of development; and strategic mobilizing for broad-based social justice issues. First, the dissertation unpacks the meaning-making practices that AID volunteers associate with the construct `development 2 ̆ 7, and demonstrates how the volunteers 2 ̆ 7 discourse of 2 ̆ 2 development as sustainability 2 ̆ 2 challenges notions of charity and the brain metaphor trafficking in policy reports and scholarship. The study then examines the treatment of diasporic imaginings of home in theory and migration policy, juxtaposed with AID 2 ̆ 7 s practices related to India arguing that practices of deconstructing home/nation allow this organization to center diasporic privilege rather than loss. This allows for less common alliance-building practices with populations from historically marginalized religious, caste and class backgrounds and a centering of marginalized voices within multiple diasporic homes. The dissertation also examines annual <b>die-ins</b> by AID 2 ̆ 7 s Austin chapter, staged in solidarity with survivors of the Bhopal gas disaster of 1984 that complicates the notion of presence in theorizations of transformation in new forms of citizenship. The study finally takes an ethnographic peek into an education project that used to be supported by AID in India. The backstage organizing work studied, suggests that what seems like a single-issue movement strategically employs universal discourses of `quality education 2 ̆ 7 for organizing multiple publics. The study required multi-sited critical ethnographic fieldwork in the United States and in India, participant observation, in-depth interviews, and rhetorical/discourse analyses of AID 2 ̆ 7 s practices. The study offers a people-centered exploration of diaspora engagement with social development, which is difficult to grasp solely through research informed by macro-level and quantitative data. Overall, this work complicates the monolithic understanding of development in current research on diaspora and development, demonstrating that local and transnational actors both participate in, and challenge the development discourse to communicatively and relationally address issues of social development and transnational environmental justice...|$|R
