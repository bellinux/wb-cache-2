The configuration {{can be changed}} through a web browser and reverted to <b>factory</b> <b>default.</b> The same way firmware can be upgraded or configuration reverted to the <b>factory</b> <b>default.</b> A text page with monitoring printout is included too, {{that can be used}} for automated parsing.|$|E
50|$|The <b>factory</b> <b>default</b> {{color scheme}} was an all-white body with orange stripes. Another scheme used was a green body with {{alternating}} slant colors to white strip. The city bus version is painted with horizontal color in white with main colour purple.|$|E
5000|$|Procedures for {{resetting}} the RSAII to <b>factory</b> <b>defaults</b> may {{be challenging}} for some users. The IBM forums list a procedure [...] for resetting an RSAII to <b>factory</b> <b>defaults</b> {{which appears to}} be simpler; it involves removing the card from the server and operating it from a non-PCI power supply.Most of the problems resolve around correct loading of the USB library. Ensuring this is properly loaded raises chances of success.|$|R

50|$|The {{debatable}} {{portions of}} the autonegotiation specifications were eliminated by the 1998 release of 802.3. This was later followed by the release of IEEE 802.3ab in 1999. The new standard specified that gigabit Ethernet over copper wiring requires autonegotiation. Currently, most network equipment manufacturers recommend using autonegotiation on all access ports and enable it as a <b>factory</b> <b>default</b> setting.|$|E
5000|$|Currently, {{the fastest}} {{notebook}} processor is the 3rd Generation Intel core i7 4930MX), a 3 GHz Quad-core processor. The new core i7 line has the [...] "Intel Turbo Boost" [...] mode that can boost its clockspeed over the <b>factory</b> <b>default</b> The first [...] "quad-core" [...] notebook processor (code named [...] "Penryn QC") {{was released by}} Intel in Q3 2008.|$|E

50|$|The LaserJet 5Si comes {{without a}} network adaptor, but an {{expansion}} slot is provided, and the firmware supports network printing. If an added network card {{can not be}} enabled, reset the printer to <b>default</b> <b>factory</b> settings - to do this, power off the printer, press and hold the online button and switch on the printer. Allow the printer to fully boot, then release the button. The printer is now reset to <b>factory</b> <b>defaults,</b> and the network configuration should now work.|$|R
50|$|As an Android device, the Nook Color can be {{modified}} to run most Android applications. One common method that unlocks this functionality is rooting, which grants users root access to the Nook Color's file system. Doing so voids the device's warranty, though it can often be returned to (non-rooted) <b>factory</b> <b>defaults</b> for warranty claims.|$|R
5000|$|The user {{need not}} always select an {{incorrect}} {{word for it}} {{to appear in the}} document. In WordPerfect 9 with <b>factory</b> <b>default</b> settings, any unrecognized word that was close enough to exactly one known word was automatically replaced with that word. Current versions of Microsoft Word come configured to [...] "auto-correct" [...] misspelled words silently as the user types. Smartphones with dictionary-supported virtual keyboards automatically replace possible mistakes with dictionary words.|$|E
50|$|A disk {{always has}} two {{password}}s: A User password and a Master password. Most disks support a Master Password Revision Code. Reportedly, some disks can report if the Master password has been changed, {{or if it}} still is the <b>factory</b> <b>default.</b> The revision code is word 92 in the IDENTIFY response. Reportedly, on some disks, a value of 0xFFFE means the Master password is unchanged. The standard does not distinguish this value.|$|E
50|$|AMT can be {{partially}} unprovisioned using the Configuration Settings, or fully unprovisioned by erasing all configuration settings, security credentials, and operational and networking settings. A partial unprovisioning leaves the PC in the setup state. In this state, the PC can self-initiate its automated, remote configuration process. A full unprovisioning erases the configuration profile {{as well as}} the security credentials and operational / networking settings required to communicate with the Intel Management Engine. A full unprovisioning returns Intel AMT to its <b>factory</b> <b>default</b> state.|$|E

50|$|Management of {{the switch}} {{requires}} that the administrative functions be associated {{with one or more}} of the configured VLANs. If the default VLAN were deleted or renumbered without first moving the management connection to a different VLAN, it is possible for the administrator to be locked out of the switch configuration, normally requiring physical access to the switch to regain management by either a forced clearing of the device configuration (possibly to the <b>factory</b> <b>default),</b> or by connecting through a console port or similar means of direct management.|$|E
5000|$|After {{returning}} his [...] "borrowed" [...] terminals, Stoll left a teleprinter {{attached to}} the intrusion line {{in order to see}} and record everything the hacker did. He watched as the hacker sought, and sometimes gained unauthorized access to, military bases around the United States, looking for files that contained words such as [...] "nuclear" [...] or [...] "SDI". The hacker also copied password files (in order to make dictionary attacks) and set up Trojan horses to find passwords. Stoll was amazed that on many of these high-security sites the hacker could easily guess passwords, since many system administrators had never bothered to change the passwords from their <b>factory</b> <b>defaults.</b> Even on military bases, the hacker was sometimes able to log in as [...] "guest" [...] with no password.|$|R
5000|$|The {{phone was}} criticized by some reviewers for sub-par GPS performance. Anandtech, {{reviewing}} the Epic 4G variant, said, [...] "the phone will take {{an inordinate amount}} of time to determine your actual location, and/or it won’t pinpoint your location very accurately." [...] Engadget described the GPS in the Vibrant and Captivate variants as [...] "utterly broken and non-functional … this is a problem for which there's no reasonable explanation why it made {{it all the way to}} retail devices." [...] Samsung released an application for the Captivate and Vibrant variants only that resets the phone's GPS settings to <b>factory</b> <b>defaults.</b> TechRadar acknowledged GPS faults in the Galaxy S and stated that these have been fixed in the Google Nexus S. There is, however, a solution to the problem and it includes opening it and welding the antenna contacts with the motherboard.|$|R

50|$|Some access points, {{when using}} <b>factory</b> <b>default</b> settings, are {{configured}} to provide wireless {{access to all}} who request it. Some commentators argue that those who set up access points without enabling security measures are offering their connection to the community. Many people intentionally leave their networks open to allow neighbours casual access, with some joining wireless community networks to share bandwidth freely. It has largely become good etiquette to leave access points open for others to use, just as someone expects to find open access points while on the road.|$|E
50|$|The {{format is}} {{supported}} by e-book readers such as FBReader, AlReader, Haali Reader, STDU Viewer, CoolReader, Fly Reader, Okular, Ectaco jetBooks, Documents for iOS, and some others. Many hardware vendors support FictionBook in their firmware: BeBook One, BeBook Mini and BeBook Club in Europe (and other Hanlin V3 and V5 based devices), all PocketBook Readers, COOL-ER devices, Cybook Opus and Cybook Gen3, and ASUS Eee Reader DR900. Devices based on the Hanvon N516 design can read FictionBook if custom OpenInkpot firmware is installed; it is <b>factory</b> <b>default</b> for Azbooka 516. Amazon's Kindle, Barnes & Noble's Nook, and Sony devices do not support FictionBook directly.|$|E
5000|$|Mirai then {{identifies}} vulnerable IoT devices using a {{table of}} more than 60 common <b>factory</b> <b>default</b> usernames and passwords, and logs into them to infect them with the Mirai malware. Infected devices will continue to function normally, except for occasional sluggishness, and an increased use of bandwidth. A device remains infected until it is rebooted, which may involve simply turning the device off and after a short wait turning it back on. After a reboot, unless the login password is changed immediately, the device will be reinfected within minutes. Upon infection Mirai will identify [...] "competing" [...] malware and remove them from memory and block remote administration ports.|$|E
5000|$|A {{possible}} workaround {{was published}} by Kriesel, which involved setting the image quality from [...] "normal" [...] to [...] "higher" [...] or [...] "high". Shortly afterwards {{it was found that}} the same fix had been suggested in the printer manual, which mentioned the occurrence of character substitutions in [...] "normal mode", indicating that Xerox was aware of the software error. In Xerox's initial response to a growing interest by the media, the error was described as occurring rarely and only when factory settings had been changed. After Kriesel provided evidence that the error was also occurring in all three image quality modes (normal, higher and high) including the <b>factory</b> <b>defaults,</b> Xerox corrected their statement and released a software patch to eliminate the problem. Despite the problem being present in some instances also in higher quality mode, Xerox advises users that they can use this mode as an alternative to applying the patch.|$|R

50|$|It is {{possible}} {{in some cases to}} force the storage to write cache frequently or even immediately using fsync which slows the writing process or one can accept that caching in the device buffer introduces some risk of data loss in case of power failure. The effectiveness of using fsync is limited by the fact that many HDD have write caching enabled by <b>factory</b> <b>default</b> in which case there is nothing about the design or settings of the database nor OS level commands that will be able to completely eliminate the chance of lost or inconsistent data {{in the event of a}} sudden power failure. Working with the OS and hardware settings to disable all caching so as to write data in real time can have significant impacts on performance in that only around 100 write operations per second would be achievable when using spinning disks.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there are}} only 16 registers, the four MSB bits of the 8-bit bus must be set to the <b>factory</b> <b>default</b> '0000' value when {{selecting}} a register. Incorrectly setting the MSB bits causes the chip to ignore the register change. General Instruments did take orders for customized MSB bits (factory set to other than '0000'). The chips made with customize-set MSB register bits allow the same processor to control more than one AY chip on the same bus (e.g. Mockingboard sound card). There are many new-old-stock (NOS) chips on the secondary market with MSB bits factory set to a non-'0000' value. The non-0000 value can cause significant developmental troubles for designers and repair technicians. Software must be written to identify the correct value of the MSB bits on any given chip. Also, software must be changed or hardware added to allow these factory set MSB chips {{to be used in}} place of the default '0000' chips.|$|E
40|$|A {{promising}} {{approach for}} improving the capacity of Wireless Mesh Networks is by making use of multiple non-overlapping RF channels. Multi-channel protocols have the advantage that several devices can transmit in parallel within a collision domain on distinct channels. When using IEEE 802. 11 b/g/a most protocol designers assume 3 and 12 non-overlapping channels, respectively. However, this simplified assumption does not hold. We present results from measurements that show {{that the number of}} available non-interfering channels depends on the antenna separation, PHY modulation, RF band, traffic pattern and whether single- or multi-radio systems are used. The problem is caused by Adjacent Channel Interference (ACI) where nearby transmitters "bleed over" to other frequencies and either cause spurious carrier sensing or frame corruption. For nearby transceivers, as in the <b>factory</b> <b>defaults</b> of multi-radio devices, this results in at most two non-interfering channels, one within 2. 4 GHz and the other within the 5 GHz band. Only if the distance between the antennas is increased, non-interfering channels within the bands themselves become available. Moreover, our comparison of single- and multi-radio systems allows us to isolate ACI from board crosstalk and radiation leakage of which only the multi-radio systems seem to suffer. Finally, we show how a packet-level simulator can be improved to realistically incorporate ACI. With the help of this simulator more confident statements about the performance of various multi-channel protocols can be made. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

With {{the help of the}} internet, online banking, social media, gaming, emails and public cloud services such as Dropbox are accessible to mobile users anytime and anywhere. Users want to bring personal devices to the workplace to access enterprise apps, work emails and private cloud services. They require speed and flexibility in carrying out their work. This concept is referred to as Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). This convenience of BYOD can compromise private and sensitive data if a device is lost or stolen. A hacker with access to a lost or stolen device can acquire confidential data. This can be catastrophic to users and organizations as {{it can be used to}} blackmail a user or sold in underground markets. Remote wiping attempts to act as a security mechanism by deleting data such as contacts, text messages, email, documents, photos and videos stored on a device. A device that is remotely wiped is reset to <b>factory</b> <b>defaults.</b> The motivation for this thesis is to evaluate the effectiveness of remote wiping tools in securely deleting data stored in the internal memory of a mobile device. This is demonstrated by remotely wiping data from two devices running Android operating system using Mobile Device Management(MDM) software. A physical image of the internal memory of the devices is created, analysed and deleted data recovered using open source mobile forensic tools. The thesis also provides an analysis of experimental findings and discussion of various attack vectors that can be carried out by a hacker in the context of the University of Turku (UTU) as a BYOD environment. An existing method to prevent data leakage, Full Disk Encryption (FDE), is presented. Finally, an overview of different methods for an effective data wipe are proposed...|$|R
50|$|On February 11, 2013, hackers {{broke into}} the EAS {{networks}} in Great Falls, Montana and Marquette, Michigan to broadcast an emergency alert that zombies have risen from their graves in several counties in Montana and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Stations KRTV in Great Falls, WBUP and WNMU-TV in Marquette broke into programming to broadcast the false alerts. It was determined {{that a number of}} stations installed station equipment without firewall or security protection, and further neglected to change <b>default</b> <b>factory</b> logins or passwords, opting to use factory presets instead. Because of this, the FCC, FEMA, equipment manufacturers, as well as trade groups, including the Michigan Association of Broadcasters, urged broadcasters to change their passwords and to recheck their security measures.|$|R
