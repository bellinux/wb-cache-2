40|$|The {{reaction}} of diethyl phosphite with triethyl orthoformate and a primary amine followed by hydrolysis is presented, {{and the reaction}} was suitable for the preparation of (aminomethylene) bisphosphonates. 3 -Amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole was chosen as an interesting substrate for this reaction because it possesses multiple groups that can serve as the amino component in the reactionâ€”namely, the side-chain and triazole amines. This substrate readily forms 1, 2, 4 -triazolyl- 3 -yl-aminomethylenebisphosphonic acid (compound 1) as a major product, along with N-ethylated bisphosphonates as side products. The in vitro antiproliferative effects of the synthesized aminomethylenebisphosphonic acids against J 774 E macrophages were determined. These compounds exhibit similar activity to zoledronic acid and higher activity than <b>incadronic</b> <b>acid...</b>|$|E
