5|$|The {{characters}} {{must then}} defeat the God Beasts {{before they can}} gather and destroy the world. However, after doing this they realize killing the God Beasts has given more power to their main enemy, who their personal enemies were working for—the Dragon Emperor for Duran and Angela, the Dark Prince for Hawk and Lise, and the Masked Mage for Kevin and Carlie. The already powerful villain absorbs {{the power of the}} Sword of Mana and the God Beasts in order to become a god, but is halted by the Mana Goddess blocking some of its power. After defeating the villain's minions, the characters go and defeat their main enemy, but are unable to stop him from destroying the Mana Tree and eliminating all Mana from the world. The Faerie then fuses with what is left of the Mana Tree; she will be reborn as the Mana Goddess in a thousand years, but until then Mana will not exist in the world.

UAE has both inbound medical tourist as well as people going out for medical treatment. The inbound tourism usually is from African countries like Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda etc. The outbound can be categorised into 2 segments - The local population (citizens of UAE) and the expats. The locals prefer to go to European destinations like U.K, Germany etc. The Expats prefer to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> home countries for treatment.|$|E

25|$|The fMRI concept {{builds on}} the earlier MRI {{scanning}} technology and the discovery of properties of oxygen-rich blood. MRI brain scans use a strong, permanent, static magnetic field to align nuclei in the brain region being studied. Another magnetic field, the gradient field, is then applied to spatially locate different nuclei. Finally, a radiofrequency (RF) pulse is played to kick the nuclei to higher magnetization levels, with the effect now depending on where they are located. When the RF field is removed, the nuclei <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> original states, and the energy they emit is measured with a coil to recreate {{the positions of the}} nuclei. MRI thus provides a static structural view of brain matter. The central thrust behind fMRI was to extend MRI to capture functional changes in the brain caused by neuronal activity. Differences in magnetic properties between arterial (oxygen-rich) and venous (oxygen-poor) blood provided this link.|$|E
25|$|In the Vasse region {{relations}} between the white settlers and the native Wardandi people were strained {{to the point of}} violence, resulting in several Aboriginal deaths.

According to another source, Layman had hired two of Gaywal's wives to work on his farm and would not let them <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> husband. A manhunt for Layman's killer went on for several weeks, involving much bloodshed as Captain Molloy, the Bussell brothers, and troops killed unknown numbers of Aboriginals in what has become known as the Wonnerup Massacre. The posse eventually shot Gaywal and captured his three sons, two of whom were imprisoned on Rottnest Island.|$|E
