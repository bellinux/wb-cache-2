40|$|The {{potential}} {{application of}} advanced forms of aircraft control to civil operation {{appears to be}} capable of being split into two areas. First, those aircraft which are very large, whose rotary inertia tends to reduce the effectiveness of conventional controls. Second, those aircraft whose specification dictates that the aeroplane be flown at very low speed. Again conventional controls become inefficient due to decreased aerodynamic efficiency. The second category of aircraft has been considered {{in the form of an}} STOL aircraft. The control problems of an STOL aircraft with a 2000 ft runway capability (Ref. 10) have been examined. It has been found that the aircraft is unstable and could require autostabilisation. None of the conventional controls were satisfactory and each required augmentation. The single strip crosswind requirement penalises the design most heavily since this requires over half of the extra control power necessary.

40|$|The {{wind tunnel}} {{is still an}} {{important}} pillar for the aerodynamic investigations of engine installation effects, such as the strong aerodynamic interferences between an underwing mounted engine and the wing itself. To consider real engine effects on the aerodynamics in the wind tunnel environment the turbine powered simulator (TPS) technique {{is one of the}} widely applied technologis. Especially for underwing <b>installed</b> engines <b>thrust</b> affects the aerodynamic drag. Reflecting the fact that in modern aircraft design engine installation improvements on drag counts in small numbers, and considering that the TPS technology cannot match the real engine in all parameters, the questions arises if no matching parameters exist what is their influence on drag. Usually fan Mach numbers and total thrust coefficients of the real engine can be correctly realized by TPS. In the present contribution the essential parameters of engine simulation are determined and in particular the thrust ratios, i. e. turbine thrust to fan thrust of real engines and simulators at different bypass ratios (BPR) in the range of 6 – 17 at cruise conditions will be evaluated. Considerable differences of the thrust ratios between the engines and the simulators exist in particular at high freestream Mach numbers. Therefore, the aim of this contribution will be to clarify the influence of the thrust ratio on the drag behaviour of an aircraft configuration. First, the theoretical background on the drag determination theory is derived. Based on this theory the analysis of the thrust ratio is done using mainly experimental results.

40|$|The most {{remarkable}} variable cycle {{characteristic of the}} variable cycle engine (VCE) is that it keeps airflow almost constant during subsonic cruise throttling by modulating variable geometries, which can efficiently decrease spillage drag and increase <b>installed</b> <b>thrust.</b> One {{of the most critical}} challenges for the modulation lies in completely maintaining airflow, as well as avoiding specific fuel consumption (SFC) degradation during throttling.

Thus, the aim {{of this paper is to}} study the variable geometries’ modulation schedule of ACE in maintaining airflow during throttling.

40|$|Studies were {{performed}} {{in order to}} characterize the thrust augmentation potential of an ejector in a Pulse Detonation Engine application. A 49 -mm diameter tube of 0. 914 -m length was constructed with one open end and one closed end. Ethylene, oxygen, and nitrogen were introduced into the tube at the closed end through {{the implementation of a}} fast mixing injector. The tube was completely filled with a stoichiometric mixture containing a one to one molar ratio of nitrogen to oxygen. Ethylene was selected as the fuel due to its detonation sensitivity and the molar ratio of the oxidizer was chosen for heat transfer purposes. Detonations were initiated in the tube {{through the use of a}} spark ignition system. The PDE was operated in a multi-cycle mode at frequencies ranging from 20 -Hz to 50 -Hz. Baseline thrust measurements with no ejector present {{were performed}} while operating the engine at various frequencies and compared to theoretical estimates. The baseline values were observed to agree with the theoretical model at low operating frequencies and proved to be increasingly lower than the predicted values as the operating frequency was increased. The baseline thrust measurements were observed to agree within 15 percent of the model for all operating frequencies. A straight 152 -mm diameter ejector was <b>installed</b> and <b>thrust</b> augmentation percentages were measured. The length of the ejector was varied while the overlap percentage (percent of the ejector length which overlapped the tube) was maintained at 25 percent for all tests. In addition, the effect of ejector inlet geometry was investigated by comparing results with a straight inlet to those of a 38 -mm inlet diameter. The thrust augmentation of the straight inlet ejector proved to be independent of engine operating frequency, augmenting thrust by 40 percent for the 0. 914 -m length ejector. In contrast, the rounded lip ejector of the same length seemed to be highly dependent on the engine operating frequency. An optimum operating frequency observed with the rounded inlet occurred at an operating frequency of 30 -Hz, resulting in thrust augmentation percentages greater than 100 percent. The effect that the engine operating frequency had on thrust augmentation levels attained with an ejector was characterized and optimum performance parameters were established. Insight into the frequency dependent nature of the ejector performance was pursued. Suggestions for future experiments which are needed to fully understand the means in which thrust augmentation is achieved in a PDE-ejector configuration were noted...|$|R
40|$|Aerodynamic {{integration}} of air intakes with increasingly compact shaping and the optimization {{of their performance}} are challenging tasks for innovative design of advanced unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) featuring superior combat or reconnaissance abilities. In order to meet configurational requirements, diverterless intake designs with optimized entry shaping and sophisticated serpentine duct layout are primary goals in the overall development process. These design challenges, however, can generate intake flow characteristics, which can adversely impact the aerodynamic performance of the intake and the engine/intake compatibility. Unsteady flow physics like separation and reattachment as well as pre-entry and internal flow control imply an advanced degree of detailed understanding of the highly three-dimensional flow during the early design process. <b>Installed</b> <b>thrust,</b> range, and weight as additional key factors strongly relate to all these design requirements. Competitive aspects demand reduced development costs and short delivery times and thus are also main drivers within the UAV design process. Current diffuser flow management and control systems are largely empirically derived. Enhanced understanding of the flow physics involved in complex innovative intake design can lead to improved active and passive methodologies for controlling these internal flows. In order to reduce costly wind tunnel experiments during the development phase of aerial vehicles the ability to accurately predict the aerodynamic performance of highly integrated intakes is of great importance.

40|$|Growing {{concerns}} about {{the environmental impact of}} aircraft operations and increasing fuel prices have led to the demand for more fuel-efficient aircraft. One of the technologies with the potential to offer a significant reduction in fuel burn is the open rotor engine. However, the noise emissions of such engines are higher than for turbofans, partially due to the typical installation of the open rotor in a pusher configuration. The wake shed by the upstream pylon results in a velocity deficit at the propeller disk, leading to unsteady blade loads and additional noise emissions. This thesis investigated the potential of pylon trailing edge blowing to reduce the adverse effects of airframe installation on the performance and noise emissions of pusher propellers. Experimental and numerical analyses were performed, focusing on the pylon wake profiles, the propeller performance, and the propeller noise emissions. The experiments were executed in Delft University of Technology's Open Jet Facility using a scale model pylon and a single-rotating powered propeller model. The numerical analysis combined an existing propeller lifting line code with analytic methods suited to predict the effects of installation on the propeller performance and noise emissions. Pylon wake measurements showed that application of the pylon trailing edge blowing system resulted in reductions in the integral wake velocity deficit of up to 60 % when compared to the unblown configuration. However, no full mixing of the external flow and the flow blown into the pylon wake was obtained. As a result, the application of blowing did not completely eliminate the pylon wake, but instead led to a velocity overshoot in the wake center and two local minima left and right of the wake centerline. From the studies of the propeller performance it was concluded that the effects of installation on the time-averaged performance are small, with maximum differences between the isolated (without pylon) and installed (with pylon) thrust and torque of less than 2 % for advance ratios below 1. 4. For the same advance ratio range the peak-to-peak variations in the <b>installed</b> <b>thrust</b> and torque were computed to be smaller than 4 % of the mean value. Excellent agreement was obtained between the experimental and numerical time-averaged isolated propeller performance for advance ratios above 0. 7, with a maximum difference of 1 % between the computed and measured data. The measurements of the propeller noise emissions showed that the sound pressure level (SPL) of the propeller tones is strongly increased due to the installation effects, with noise penalties of up to 10 to 25 dB for the first six tones occurring at integer multiples of the blade passage frequency (BPF). Broadband levels on the other hand were unaffected by the presence of the upstream pylon. The application of blowing resulted in significant noise reductions when compared to the unblown installed case. Depending on the operating conditions, at the highest blowing rate considered SPL reductions were obtained of up to 4 dB for the 1 BPF tone, 8 dB for the 2 BPF tone, and 12 dB for the 3 BPF tone. Furthermore, the higher BPF tones (4 BPF and above) were practically eliminated. The evolution of the noise reduction due to blowing {{as a function of the}} advance ratio followed the trend in the noise penalty due to installation, thereby confirming that the application of blowing indeed successfully opposes the installation effects.

40|$|LectureA new {{technology}} challenge in centrifugal compressor design and operation is the condensate phase management. End users (especially in offshore and subsea operations) {{are more and}} more interested to have a Wet Gas Compression system which is able to tolerate liquid in the process gas. Authors? Company has initiated for several years a research program aiming to investigate the impact of the liquid phase on centrifugal compressor operability (mainly thermodynamics, rotordynamics, erosion, axial thrust). As an introduction, the Authors? Company past experiences and more recent experimental tests [Ransom D. et al. 2011], [Bertoneri M. et al. 2012], are reviewed in order to show how the rotordynamic behaviour of a centrifugal compressor may be affected by the wet gas. However in the core, this paper is focused on the novel rotordynamic experimental outcomes of a wet gas single stage compressor test campaign. The machine was equipped with the following special instrumentation: Pressure and temperature probes along the flow path and internal seals; Magnetic lamination installed on the shaft end to allow for stability test through a magnetic exciter; Load cells <b>installed</b> in the <b>thrust</b> bearing; Torquemeter <b>installed</b> at the compressor coupling. The explored test conditions were: Wet gas = Air and Water mixture up to 3 % of Liquid Volume Fraction (LVF); Suction pressure levels = 10, 15, 20 bar-a; Maximum Continuous Speed = 13500 rpm. The compressor went through an extensive test campaign where the following aspects were thoroughly investigated: Rotordynamic behaviour during steady state wet operation; Rotordynamic stability (through magnetic exciter); Transient phenomena: response to liquid load variations (LVF up to 8 %), start-up/shutdown from wet conditions, start-up with stratified flow into suction pipe. The compressor dynamic behaviour was monitored both from lateral viewpoint (using no contact probes located close to bearing locations) and axial/torsional viewpoint (through the special instrumentation described above). Overall the compressor was able to withstand a huge amount of liquid phase, with an increased vibration level with respect to dry conditions but still in the safe area, both in steady and transient tests. Finally, major differences were found only at high flow ? high liquid/gas density ratio conditions where an unexpected subsynchronous vibration (SSV) was showing up. The nature of this SSV was deeply investigated and finally it was fixed through a balance piston seal geometry change...|$|R
