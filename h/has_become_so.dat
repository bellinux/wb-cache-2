5|$|A working {{knowledge}} of English has become a requirement {{in a number of}} occupations and professions such as medicine and computing. English <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> important in scientific publishing that more than 80 percent of all scientific journal articles indexed by Chemical Abstracts in 1998 were written in English, as were 90 percent of all articles in natural science publications by 1996 and 82 percent of articles in humanities publications by 1995.|$|E

5|$|Originally made {{by farmers}} {{to reduce the}} amount of waste from their milk, clotted cream <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> deep-rooted in the culture of {{southwest}} Britain that it is embedded as part of the region's tourist attraction. While there is no doubt of its strong and long association with Cornwall and Devon, it is not clear of its actual antiquity, or more recent development.|$|E
5|$|Before {{heading out}} to a {{baseball}} game at a nearby ballpark, sports fan Mr. Brown drinks several highball cocktails. He arrives at the ballpark to watch the game, but <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> inebriated that the game appears to him in reverse, with the players running the bases backwards and the baseball flying back into the pitcher's hand. After the game is over, Mr. Brown is escorted home {{by one of his}} friends. When they arrive at Brown's house, they encounter his wife who becomes furious with the friend and proceeds to physically assault him, believing he is responsible for her husband's severe intoxication.|$|E
5|$|However, many {{traits that}} appear to be simple adaptations are in fact exaptations: {{structures}} originally adapted for one function, but which coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process. One example is the African lizard Holaspis guentheri, which developed an extremely flat head for hiding in crevices, as can be seen by looking at its near relatives. However, in this species, the head <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> flattened that it assists in gliding from tree to tree—an exaptation. Within cells, molecular machines such as the bacterial flagella and protein sorting machinery evolved by the recruitment of several pre-existing proteins that previously had different functions. Another example is the recruitment of enzymes from glycolysis and xenobiotic metabolism to serve as structural proteins called crystallins within the lenses of organisms' eyes.|$|E

25|$|Most {{scientific}} journals cover a single scientific field and publish the research within that field; {{the research is}} normally expressed {{in the form of}} a scientific paper.

The sport <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> popular that in 2004, more spectators attended rodeo events than professional football matches.|$|E
25|$|The message I {{would give}} to Aikidoka {{in general is}} that what we see today is not, in my humble opinion, the Aikido of the founder. It <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> many other things. So many complications, {{additions}} and unnecessary requirements hide the essential nature of the art. However, those who seek shall find, and if they are able to step outside of the box and dispassionately explore, they may discover a very simple magical secret!".|$|E

25|$|Stylistically, the {{lighting}} in the San Zaccaria piece <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> soft and diffuse {{that it makes}} that in the San Giobbe appear almost raking in contrast. Giovanni's use of the oil medium had matured, and the holy figures seem to be swathed in a still, rarefied air. The San Zaccaria is considered perhaps the most beautiful and imposing of all Giovanni's altarpieces, and is dated 1505, the year following that of Giorgione's Madonna of Castelfranco.|$|E
25|$|Two of the most-awaited {{events in}} the campus are the Lantern Parade, held {{in the last week}} before the Christmas break, and the U.P. Fair, held every February. During the Lantern Parade, the {{individual}} colleges as well as groups within U.P.D. create Christmas lanterns and floats and parade around the Academic Oval, culminating in a lengthy program held in front of the Amphitheater capped off by a massive fireworks display. In recent years the event <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> popular even outside of UP that media outlets and major Manila television networks regularly send crews to broadcast the event live.|$|E
25|$|The setting {{has been}} heavily updated from its last event book series, Firestorm, which covered {{the opening of}} the Fourth Corporate War. The {{aftermath}} of the Fourth Corporate War has resulted in widespread corruption of the Net and major losses of hardcopied data, to the point that all data is intangible and recent recorded history is in doubt. An example that pops up in Pondsmith's demos at conventions, releases on the Internet, and in the finished game is that history <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> corrupted that many people in the world now believe Richard Nixon, instead of resigning over Watergate, committed suicide on camera and that memes such as the moon landing being hoaxed become prevalent.|$|E

25|$|However, {{along with}} the rise in {{broadband}} internet connections beginning around 1998, higher quality movies began to see widespread distribution – {{with the release of}} DeCSS, ISO images copied directly from the original DVDs were slowly becoming a feasible distribution method. Today, movie sharing <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> common that it has caused major concern amongst movie studios and their representative organizations. Because of this the MPAA is often running campaigns during movie trailers where it tries to discourage people from copying material without permission. Unlike the music industry, which has had online music stores available for several years, the movie industry moved to online distribution only in 2006, after the launch of Amazon Unbox.|$|E
25|$|Biochemistry, {{sometimes}} called biological chemistry, {{is the study}} of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms. By controlling information flow through biochemical signaling and the flow of chemical energy through metabolism, biochemical processes give rise to the complexity of life. Over the last decades of the 20th century, biochemistry <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> successful at explaining living processes that now almost all areas of the life sciences from botany to medicine to genetics are engaged in biochemical research. Today, the main focus of pure biochemistry is on understanding how biological molecules give rise to the processes that occur within living cells, which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of tissues, organs, and whole organisms—that is, all of biology.|$|E
25|$|The Malay {{language}} {{came into}} widespread use as the lingua franca of the Malacca Sultanate (1402–1511). During this period, the Malay language developed rapidly {{under the influence}} of Islamic literature. The development changed the nature of the language with massive infusion of Arabic, Tamil and Sanskrit vocabularies, called Classical Malay. Under the Sultanate of Malacca the language evolved into a form recognisable to speakers of modern Malay. When the court moved to establish the Johor Sultanate, it continued using the classical language; it <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>so</b> associated with Dutch Riau and British Johor that it is often assumed that the Malay of Riau is close to the classical language. However, there is no connection between Malaccan Malay as used on Riau and the Riau vernacular.|$|E
