25|$|<b>Health</b> <b>security</b> – <b>Health</b> <b>Security</b> aims to {{guarantee}} a minimum protection from diseases and unhealthy lifestyles. In developing countries, the major causes of death traditionally were infectious and parasitic diseases, whereas in industrialized countries, the major killers were diseases of the circulatory system. Today, lifestyle-related chronic diseases are leading killers worldwide, with 80 percent of deaths from chronic diseases occurring in low- and middle-income countries. According to the United Nations, in both developing and industrial countries, threats to <b>health</b> <b>security</b> are usually greater for poor people in rural areas, particularly children. This is due to malnutrition and insufficient access to health services, clean water and other basic necessities.|$|E

Opponents of the bill organized against it before it {{was presented to the}} Democratic-controlled Congress on November 20, 1993. The bill was a complex proposal of more than 1000 pages, the core element of which was an enforced mandate for employers to provide health insurance coverage to all of their employees.

In this sector, {{the number of employees}} who work directly is 35. 000 and the numbers of employees who work indirectly 100. 000 are employed. The sector requires obligations and necessary activities in terms of vocational <b>health</b> and <b>security</b> since it includes working risks and has an increasing importance. Because of the lack of the vocational <b>health</b> and <b>security</b> measures, it has been seen many deaths and accidents in Tuzla Shipyards. Especially, the lack of trainings and measures to prevent to the industrial accident is an indication that there is a perception problem towards vocational <b>health</b> and <b>security.</b> Contrary to this, though it is taught on vocational <b>health</b> and <b>security,</b> the perceptions of the workers may not be enough. In this mean, it needs to be studied what to extend and how the workers perceive and apply the vocational <b>health</b> and <b>security</b> trainings or applications, which are taught at the shipyards, in workplace.

25|$|Due to {{its large}} influx of {{tourists}} each year, Barcelona, {{like many other}} tourism capitals, {{has to deal with}} pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen items. For this reason, most travel guides recommend that visitors take precautions in order to ensure their possessions' safety, especially inside the metro premises. Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona {{is considered one of the}} safest cities in terms of <b>health</b> <b>security</b> and personal safety, mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by Business Insider.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses (FOS) {{provides}} {{scientific advice}} for {{organizations and the}} public on issues concerning the safety of food. Its mission is to lower the burden of foodborne disease, thereby strengthening the <b>health</b> <b>security</b> and sustainable development of Member States. Foodborne and waterborne diarrhoeal diseases kill an estimated 2.2 million people annually, {{most of whom are}} children. WHO works closely with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to address food safety issues along the entire food production chain—from production to consumption—using new methods of risk analysis. These methods provide efficient, science-based tools to improve food safety, thereby benefiting both public health and economic development.|$|E
25|$|There was {{a renewed}} push for health {{insurance}} reform in 1974. In January, representatives Martha Griffiths and James C. Corman introduced the <b>Health</b> <b>Security</b> Act, a universal national health insurance program providing comprehensive benefits without any cost sharing backed by the AFL-CIO and UAW. The following month Nixon again proposed the Comprehensive Health Insurance Actan employer mandate to offer private health insurance if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage. In April, Kennedy and Mills introduced the National Health Insurance Act, a bill to provide near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes and with lower cost sharing. Both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizens organizations, and neither gained traction. That summer, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call {{for health insurance}} reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan, but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise.|$|E

500|$|The 1993 Republican alternative, {{introduced}} by Senator John Chafee as the Health Equity and Access Reform Today Act, contained a [...] "universal coverage" [...] requirement with a penalty for noncompliance—an individual mandate—as well as subsidies {{to be used}} in state-based 'purchasing groups'. Advocates for the 1993 bill included prominent Republicans such as Senators Orrin Hatch, Chuck Grassley, Bob Bennett and Kit Bond. Of 1993's 43 Republican Senators, 20 supported the HEART Act. Another Republican proposal, introduced in 1994 by Senator Don Nickles (R-OK), the Consumer Choice <b>Health</b> <b>Security</b> Act, contained an individual mandate with a penalty provision; however, Nickles subsequently removed the mandate from the bill, stating he had decided [...] "that government should not compel people to buy health insurance". At the time of these proposals, Republicans did not raise constitutional issues with the mandate; Mark Pauly, who helped develop a proposal that included an individual mandate for George H. W. Bush, remarked, [...] "I don't remember that being raised at all. The way it was viewed by the Congressional Budget Office in 1994 was, effectively, as a tax." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hazard {{analysis}} and critical control points or HACCP (...) is a systematic preventive approach to food safety from biological, chemical, and physical hazards in production processes {{that can cause}} the finished product to be unsafe, and designs measurements to reduce these risks to a safe level. In this manner, HACCP attempts to avoid hazards rather than attempting to inspect finished products {{for the effects of}} those hazards. The HACCP system can be used at all stages of a food chain, from food production and preparation processes including packaging, distribution, etc. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) require mandatory HACCP programs for juice and meat as an effective approach to food safety and protecting public health. Meat HACCP systems are regulated by the USDA, while seafood and juice are regulated by the FDA. All other food companies in the United States that are required to register with the FDA under the Public <b>Health</b> <b>Security</b> and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, as well as firms outside the US that export food to the US, are transitioning to mandatory hazard {{analysis and}} risk-based preventive controls (HARPC) plans.|$|E

In 1947, the university donated 15 acres of land to the United States Department of Health and Human Services {{for the construction of}} the CDC headquarters. The Emory University Prevention Research Center (EPRC) and Emory Center for Injury Control are funded by the CDC. Emory University's African Center of Excellence for Public <b>Health</b> <b>Security,</b> which seeks to improve preparedness and response to health threats in low-income countries, is a five-year, multimillion-dollar cooperative program with the CDC and International Association of National Public Health Institutes (IANPHI). The Emory University Center for Global Safe Water (CGSW), which conducts applied research, evaluation, and training to promote global health equity through universal access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene, works in collaboration with the CDC. The Emory University Global Health Institute, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, partners with the CDC to enhance public health infrastructure in low-resource countries. The Emory University Hospital Isolation Unit and Quarantine Station was established by the CDC following the 2003 SARS outbreak. The isolation and treatment facilities at Emory University {{played a crucial role in}} ending the 2014 Ebola virus cases in the United States. CDC scientists and administrators hold memberships and frequently speak at Emory University's Vaccine Dinner Club (VDC), an association that holds monthly academic meetings to discuss and advance [...] vaccine research. In 2015, Emory was made a member of the CDC's Prevention Epicenters Program, a research program in which CDC’s Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) collaborates with academic investigators to conduct innovative infection control and prevention research.|$|E
