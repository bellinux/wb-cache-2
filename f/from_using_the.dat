5|$|Another $500,000 {{study was}} ordered in 2003 by the legislature, {{creating}} a new commerce corridor to link Lewis County {{in the south to}} the Canada–US border in the north. However the study showed that a highway existing north of I-90 was not economically feasible. The study proposed a toll road only for trucks, since the presence of passenger cars would discourage truck drivers <b>from</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> new alternate route. The highway was estimated to cost between $13.5 and $19 billion.|$|E
5|$|From October 1988 to September 1994 {{the voices}} of representatives from Sinn Féin and several Irish republican and loyalist groups were banned by the British {{government}} from being broadcast on television and radio in the United Kingdom. The restrictions, announced by the Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, on 19 October 1988, covered eleven organisations based in Northern Ireland and followed a heightened period {{of violence in the}} history of the Troubles, as well as the government's belief in a need to prevent Sinn Féin <b>from</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> media for political advantage.|$|E
5|$|Horse-drawn {{traffic was}} {{partially}} {{banned from the}} tunnel during peak hours in July 1939 and completely banned in August 1947.

5|$|In 2015, the pro-independence group People's Voice {{established}} a demonstration {{camp on the}} grounds of the Scottish parliament demanding independence. this camp was objected to as it risked infringing on the political neutrality of the parliamentary estate and prevented others <b>from</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> grounds.

5|$|In November of {{that year}} the same group planted a bomb that blew out the front of Nussbaum's house, while {{he and his wife}} were {{sleeping}} there. Nussbaum blamed the bombings on local antisemitism and bigotry, but most of his congregation blamed it on Nussbaum's anti-segregationist activism. Though the congregation officially supported him, a number of members privately urged him to leave Beth Israel and find another pulpit. The synagogue's board of trustees voted to prohibit non-Jewish groups <b>from</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> synagogue's premises unless they had prior approval from the board; the intent was to put an end to the interracial meetings that Nussbaum held there.|$|E

5|$|In Sir Thursday, {{readers are}} also {{introduced}} to the power issues that Arthur begins to struggle with – his natural compassion and desire for fairness and kindness, against the characteristics displayed by other senior denizens and Dame Primus, {{and the influence of}} the key. In addition, the idea of Arthur losing his mortality and becoming an immortal Denizen of the House, represented by the silver/gold crocodile ring that was introduced in Drowned Wednesday, is further explored, with Arthur often choosing to refrain <b>from</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> key – and the power it represents – to ensure he remains human.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the whiskey tax, westerners {{had a number of}} other grievances with the national government, chief among which was the perception that the government was not adequately protecting the residents living in western frontier. The Northwest Indian War was going badly for the United States, with major losses in 1791. Furthermore, westerners were prohibited by Spain (which then owned Louisiana) <b>from</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi River for commercial navigation. Until these issues were addressed, westerners felt that the government was ignoring their security and economic welfare. Adding the whiskey excise to these existing grievances only increased tensions on the frontier.|$|E

5|$|Monsanto {{developed}} patents for {{genetically modified}} soybeans that were resistant to glyphosate-based herbicides. When farmers sprayed the modified soybeans with the glyphosate herbicide Roundup, the modified soybeans would survive while competing plants (weeds) would be killed.
