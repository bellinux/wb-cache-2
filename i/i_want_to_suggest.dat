Nonetheless, news of the atomic bombing was greeted enthusiastically in the U.S.; a poll in Fortune magazine in late 1945 showed a significant minority of Americans (22.7%) wishing that more atomic bombs could have been dropped on Japan. The initial positive response was supported by the imagery presented to the public (mainly the powerful images of the mushroom cloud) and the censorship of photographs that showed corpses and maimed survivors.

Its neighbours were comparatively barbarous, except the Japanese, who acquired their civilization by slavish imitation of China. The view of Chien Lung was no more absurd than that of Alexander the Great, sighing for new worlds to conquer when he had never even heard of China, where Confucius had been dead already for a hundred and fifty years. Nor was he mistaken as regards trade: China produces everything needed for the happiness of its inhabitants, and we have forced trade upon them solely for our benefit, giving them in exchange only things which they would do better without.|$|E

I try to show that we can accept their novel theory of capital as a capitalised and commodified form of power, but argue that the concept of primitive accumulation still has considerable analytical value for theorising the extension and depth of capitalist social property relations within and across political jurisdictions...|$|R
5000|$|The {{thoughts}} that concerned me most {{in making this}} statue were the necessities of representing a vital energy, lean physical strength, and a tree-like growth suggestive of the strong roots of character that were growing and manifest as early as his Indiana years. In the rather knotty and active forms of the body, I have tried to express that, {{as well as the}} rough warmth of his frontier humanity and the ungainliness of his bony frame.In the simple but rough-surfaced pedestal, and in the quiet shadowed, thoughtful head, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> the very simple, classic character of his mind - as well as the loneliness and tragedy of his life.In the hair, I tried for boyishness and humor. I felt it unimportant to invent a purely imaginary portrait of how Lincoln might have looked at twenty-one years. Our knowledge of his appearance, on which the popular symbol of Lincoln is based, is from photographs taken after his fortieth year; my face, therefore, is a compromise between the unknown Indiana youth and the pre-presidential Illinois lawyer.The true look of Lincoln during his Indiana years is as unimportant as the historical accuracy of his clothing. In favor of representing his character and his contemporary significance to the best advantage, I have subordinated every literal element except the book. In the light of Lincoln's whole life, the axe is unimportant as the book.The placement of the figure was chosen for two reasons: I felt that Lincoln should be placed back among the trees on the plaza, since the forest was his Indiana experience; and {{it would be difficult to}} compete in scale with the open plaza and building were the figure to be placed in the open.

5000|$|The sound {{engineer}} was , {{who worked on}} most of Godard's major films from Lettre à Freddy Buache to Allemagne année 90 neuf zéro. Shakespeare's original play is full of lines containing animal imagery. In King Lear Godard fills the soundtrack with a barrage of semi-identifiable animal noises: {{one of the most}} noticeable is the shrill and raucous call of a crow. This is a recurring sound in Godard's films, including Allemagne année 90 neuf zéro and JLG/JLG. A detail of Wheatfield with Crows, one of Van Gogh’s very last paintings, appears towards the end of King Lear. Discussing JLG/JLG, Nora M.

40|$|According to {{a recent}} paper by Tim Maudlin, Bell’s theorem has nothing {{to tell us about}} realism or the {{descriptive}} completeness of quantum mechanics. What it shows is that quantum mechanics is non-local, no more and no less. What I intend to do in this paper is to challenge Maudlin’s assertion about the import of Bell’s proof. There is much that I agree with in the paper; in particular, it does us the valuable service of demonstrating (hopefully once and for all) that Einstein’s objections to quantum mechanics {{have nothing to do with}} its (supposed) indeterminism. But I do think that Maudlin’s conclusion is overly cut-and-dried. Quantum mechanics (as Maudlin would be the first to admit) is far from a unified edifice, and what Bell’s theorem shows depends on what version of quantum mechanics you look at. In particular, I’ll try to make the case that there’s an interesting, if ultimately uncompelling anti-realist construal of the import of Bell’s theorem. And <b>I</b> also <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that locality isn’t quite as decisively defeated as Maudlin claims. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{picture was}} drawn by Lieutenant Kurt Reuber, a German staff {{physician}} and Protestant pastor, in December 1942 during the Battle of Stalingrad. Reuber wrote: I wondered {{for a long}} while what I should paint, and in the end I decided on a Madonna, or mother and child. I have turned my hole in the frozen mud into a studio. The space is too small for {{me to be able to}} see the picture properly, so I climb on to a stool and look down at it from above, to get the perspective right. Everything is repeatedly knocked over, and my pencils vanish into the mud. There is nothing to lean my big picture of the madonna against, except a sloping, home-made table past which I can just manage to squeeze. There are no proper materials and I have used a Russian map for paper. But I wish I could tell you how absorbed I have been painting my madonna, and how much it means to me.""The picture looks like this: the mother's head and the child's lean toward each other, and a large cloak enfolds them both. It is intended to symbolize 'security' and 'mother love.' I remembered the words of St.John: light, life, and love. What more can <b>I</b> add? <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> these three things in the homely and common vision of a mother with her child and the security that they represent. He added that he:went to all the bunkers, brought my drawing to the men, and chatted with them. How they sat there! Like being in their dear homes with mother for the holiday. Later, Reuber hung the drawing in his bunker for his unit celebration, which he described as a moment of Christian devotion shared by all the soldiers in his command. When according to ancient custom I opened the Christmas door, the slatted door of our bunker, and the comrades went in, they stood as if entranced, devout and too moved to speak in front of the picture on the clay wall...The entire celebration took place under the influence of the picture, and they thoughtfully read the words: light, life, love...Whether commander or simple soldier, the Madonna was always an object of outward and inward contemplation.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{address the issue}} of point of view, {{in the context of the}} National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) as a Native place that stages itself as the {{location}} of a cross-cultural encounter. It seems to me that some of the controversies that have surrounded the National Museum of the American Indian can be approached constructively through the concept of narrative. The spatial placing of the visitor within the museum space, and the shaping of the visitor’s possibilities for movement within the museum displays, enacts a linear narrative that corresponds to the telling of a history. It is precisely the telling of historical narratives that the National Museum of the American Indian deliberately places into question – to the considerable discomfort of some visitors. I begin by outlining the mission or intention of the museum designers and curators before describing briefly the objections that have been made to this conception of what this particular museum should be. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> then <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> some ways in which we can approach this controversy narratologically, and to think about what the National Museum of the American Indian tells us about contemporary approaches to the study of American Indian cultures...|$|R

40|$|One of my {{ultimate}} aims is to {{show that}} any story concerning the semantics of rigid designation is necessarily incoherent. This paper is intended to go some way towards supplying ammunition for such an argument. However, as the concept of rigidity has some intuitive appeal, it may be that it is presupposed (in some ill-defined manner) by the speaker/hearer in certain contexts, such presupposition being mediated by pragmatic forces. Perhaps I'll develop this view elsewhere; for the moment I shall do no more than suggest that such an assumption would itself be directly dependent on cultural considerations, such as the language user's metaphysical beliefs. More precisely, <b>I</b> not only <b>want</b> <b>to</b> argue that the stipulation of the constant identity of individuals across worlds is not a semantic feature of any linguistic expression, <b>I</b> also <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that the content of such a stipulation is not even a predictable pragmatic enrichment of any uses of any class of expression. My argument is that language and metaphysics come apart, and how a language user regards the identity of individuals is never a matter of linguistic fiat. As is well known, many philosophers, and some linguists, adopt a contrary view. In particular, Recanati (1993, and elsewhere) posits the semantic feature REF, which feature- he claims- is the distinguishing mark of both indexicals and proper names. His claim is that RE...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} address the {{question}} of the morality of technology. I believe this is an important question for our contemporary society in which technology, especially information technology, is increasingly becoming the default mode of social ordering. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that the conventional manner of conceptualising the morality of technology is inadequate – even dangerous. The conventional view of technology is that technology represents technical means to achieve social ends. Thus, the moral problem of technology, from this perspective, {{is the way in which}} the given technical means are applied to particular (good or bad) social ends. In opposition to this <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that the assumed separation, of this approach, between technical means and social ends are inappropriate.

In order to critique this approach I will draw on phenomenology and the more recent work of Bruno Latour. With these intellectual resources in mind I will propose disclosive ethics as a way to make the morality of technology visible. I will give a brief account of this approach and show how it might guide our understanding of the ethics and politics of technology by considering two examples of contemporary information technology: search engines and plagiarism detection systems...|$|E

This is because they offer a wider, and more dynamic, understanding of contemporary representation than other accounts to date. Unlike the various strands of structuralist criticism, postmodernism considers images {{as they relate to}} and across each other. Postmodernism deflects attention away from the singular scrutinizing gaze of the semiologist, and asks that this be replaced by a multiplicity of fragmented, and frequently interrupted, &dquo;looks. &dquo; The exemplary text or the single, richly coded, image, gives way to the textual thickness and the visual density of everyday life, as though the slow, even languid &dquo;look&dquo; of the semiologist is, by the 1980 ’s, out of tempo with the times.

60|$|It {{is quite}} justifiable for us British, no doubt, {{if we do}} really play the part of honest trustees, to remain in Egypt and in India under {{existing}} conditions; it is even {{possible for us to}} glance at the helplessness of Arabia, Palestine, and Mesopotamia, as yet incapable of self-government, helpless as new-born infants. But our case, our only justifiable case, is that we are trustees because there is no better trustee possible. And the creation of a council of a League of Free Nations would be like the creation of a Public Trustee for the world. The creation of a League of Free Nations must necessarily be the creation of an authority that may legitimately call existing empires to give an account of their stewardship. For an unchecked fragmentary control of tropical and chaotic regions, it substitutes the possibility of a general authority. And this must necessarily alter the problems not only of the politically immature nations and the control of the tropics, but also of the regulation of the sea ways, the regulation of the coming air routes, and the distribution of staple products in the world.
