A continuous cooling transformation diagram was constructed providing valuable information for predicting microstructural evolution and mechanical properties at different cooling rates during actual welding fabrication. Welding trials were carried out utilising flux-cored arc welding technique in combination with an austenitic stainless steel consumable. The effect of various preheat and <b>interpass</b> temperatures on cooling rate and consequently on the heat affected zone microstructure and mechanical properties of multipass welds were investigated...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{describes}} {{the evolution of}} a strong, single-component rotated-Brass ((1 1 0)) texture in an Al-Zn-Mg-Cu-Zr alloy by an uneven hot cross-rolling with frequent <b>interpass</b> annealing. This texture development is unique because hot rolling of aluminum alloys results in orientation distribution along the ``beta-fibre''. It has been demonstrated that the deformation by cross-rolling of a partially recrystallized grain structure having rotated-Cube and Goss orientations, and the recrystallization resistance of near-Brass-oriented elongated grains {{play a critical role in}} development of this texture.

40|$|Distinct yield {{drops and}} {{serrations}} were observed on the stress-strain curves of a 304 type stainless steel when tested at high temperatures (850 [...] 1200 ºC). A proposed {{explanation for the}} behavior is static strain aging (SSA) and dynamic strain aging (DSA), respectively, caused {{by the presence of}} substitutional elements. Much of the previous work on this topic has been focused on the effects of interstitials, namely carbon and nitrogen, at lower temperatures (100 [...] 300 ºC, depending on the strain rate). However, for substitutional elements to have the same effect, the temperature range must be significantly higher. To further investigate the likelihood that SSA and DSA are caused by substitutional elements, the domain (i. e. temperature and strain rate range) within which yield drops and serrated yielding are observed was studied. The results of this investigation showed that the appearance of SSA is dependent upon the pass strain, <b>interpass</b> time and strain rate, whereas the presence of DSA serrations was strongly dependent upon strain rate. The disappearance of yield drops involves <b>interpass</b> times in excess of one second. This is hypothesized to result from the disappearance of the deformation vacancies and of the associated non-equilibrium segregation. The impurity element phosphorus was isolated as the most probable cause of the observed phenomenon. This is a result of its high diffusivity, combined with its high binding energy...|$|E
40|$|The {{hot rolling}} process {{of a low}} Nb-microalloyed steel under {{different}} <b>interpass</b> time conditions is simulated by means of hot torsion tests. Subsequent graphic representation of the Mean Flow Stress (MFS) versus the inverse of the absolute temperature for each pass allows us to know the critical rolling temperatures (Tnr, Ar 3, Ar 1) and to characterize the progressive strengthening of austenite due to incomplete recrystallization between Tnr and Ar 3, thanks to the measurement of a magnitude called accumulated stress (Δσ). Optical and electron microscopy studies demonstrate that {{the evolution of the}} microstructure and the precipitation state—particularly the mean particle size—over the rolling schedule is strongly dependent on the <b>interpass</b> time. A review is made of the expressions that have been proposed to estimate the values of recrystallization driving (FR) and pinning forces (FP). Using these expressions and the experimental data from the hot rolling simulations performed, the evolution of FR and FP during rolling is studied. A comparative analysis of hypotheses concerning the interaction between precipitates and migrating grain boundaries is achieved and the methods for estimating the volume fraction of precipitates and the dislocation density are assessed. Though the selected criterion significantly influences the values obtained for both forces, it is found that FP always grows faster than FR as the rolling temperature drops, which helps to explain the start of inhibition of the static recrystallization of austenite at temperatures below Tnr.

40|$|Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is a two phase alloy {{used in the}} aerospace, {{military}} and biomedical industries. The thermomechanical processing (TMP) of Ti- 6 A- 4 V involves {{the breakdown of the}} ingot microstructure at temperatures above the beta transus (Tβ) into fine lamellar colonies. Subsequent hot deformation is carried out at temperatures within the two phase region to produce a microstructure that is either equiaxed or bimodal. However, to avoid the formation of shear bands, voids or cracks within the final microstructure, this secondary fabrication is carried out at slow speeds, and these render the TMP of titanium a time consuming and expensive process. This project aims to investigate the possibility of using a steckel mill for the TMP of Ti 6 Al 4 V. A steckel mill is a single stand reversing mill with 2 coiler furnaces on either side. These furnaces allow for the annealing of strip metal in between passes thus keeping the strip at a high temperature throughout processing. In this way, reversing passes can occur indefinitely until a desired gauge thickness is achieved. A steckel mill therefore represents a cheaper and faster method to produce metal sheet or plate. Ti- 6 Al- 4 V cylinders with a diameter of 10 mm and length of 15 mm were uniaxially compressed in the Gleeble 3800. Hot compression was carried out isothermally in a 3 pass schedule at temperatures of 850 °C, 950 °C and 1050 °C. The strain was kept constant at 0. 48 and strain rates of 1 /s and 10 /s employed. <b>Interpass</b> times corresponding to a strain rate of 10 /s were 44 s and 77 s, whilst those corresponding to a strain rate of 1 /s were 324 s and 712 s. Statistical analysis in the form of analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the parameter most influential on the microstructural evolution of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and the Taguchi method used to identify the optimum parameters suitable for the TMP of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V using a steckel mill. Three successive passes at 850 °C, 1 /s resulted in a microstructure consisting of coarse, deformed grains and some finer recrystallised grains. The influence of a low strain rate was such that it promoted recrystallisation at this temperature, while that of <b>interpass</b> time brought about recrystallisation and grain growth. At the same temperature and a strain rate of 10 /s, less recrystallisation, together with a heavily deformed microstructure was observed. This was due to the heterogeneous distribution of strain which was a consequence of the high strain rate used. At 950 °C, at both 1 /s and 10 /s, 1 pass resulted in a bimodal microstructure. With subsequent passes, the amount of equiaxed alpha was observed to increase. This increase was a result of a strain induced phase transformation (SIT) from beta to alpha at high temperatures. The extent of this transformation increased with an increase in strain rate. Therefore, after 3 consecutive passes at 10 /s, a fully alpha (though heavily deformed) microstructure was formed. A subsequent post deformation heat treatment would lead to recrystallisation of these grains and a microstructure consisting of refined equiaxed grains the result. After 1 pass at 1050 °C, at either 1 /s or 10 /s, a Widmanstätten microstructure was formed. However, after 3 consecutive passes at 1 /s, the microstructure remained mostly Widmanstätten whilst at 10 /s, a bimodal microstructure was formed. The combination of a high strain rate, low <b>interpass</b> times, sequential strain imparted on the sample as well as the high temperature at which the compressions were carried out, elevated {{the extent to which a}} strain induced phase transformation from alpha to beta proceeded. Statistical analysis using ANOVA and the Taguchi method revealed that a schedule of 3 passes performed at 1050 °C, 1 /s and the corresponding <b>interpass</b> times as being the optimum parameters for the TMP of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V during steckel mill rolling. Analysis of the microstructural evolution across all 3 temperatures, however, showed that 3 passes carried at 950 °C, 10 /s, with <b>interpass</b> times of 44 s and 77 s, as being the optimum parameters. Steckel mill rolling of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V has thus been confirmed as a feasible process for the production of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V sheet material...|$|E
