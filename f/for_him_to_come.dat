25|$|Interest in {{one local}} {{election}} race surrounded Gérard Vignoble of the UDF, who had represented Roubaix since 1988. Vignoble {{announced that he}} would not stand again since this would put him against cardiologist Salem Kacet of the UMP, who had operated on him in 1999 and saved his life. The two candidates had become close friends. Vignoble said that it was impossible <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to any other decision. Nevertheless, Kacet still failed to take the seat, the winner being the Socialist Dominique Baert.|$|E
25|$|Cruceta was {{expected}} {{to compete for the}} vacant spots in the Tigers bullpen during spring training , left by Joel Zumaya and Fernando Rodney after they suffered shoulder injuries. Cruceta's chances of making the Tigers bullpen was dealt a blow when his visa was withheld, allegedly due to his suspension in 2007. After two months of waiting, Cruceta was granted his visa on April 9, allowing <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to the U.S. from his native Dominican Republic. After returning to the United States, Cruceta was brought up to the Tigers on April 30, 2008, when Jason Grilli was traded to the Colorado Rockies. Cruceta made 13 appearances for the Tigers, going 0–3 with an ERA of 5.40. On June 3, Cruceta was designated for assignment; after clearing waivers, he joined the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. He became a free agent {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E

25|$|In the Vulgate Cycle, he is {{depicted}} as a proud and worldly knight who demonstrates through his failures the danger of neglecting the spirit for the futile gifts of the material world. On the Grail quest, his intentions are always the purest, but {{he is unable to}} use God's grace to see the error in his ways. Later, when his brothers Agravain and Mordred plot to destroy Lancelot and Guinevere by exposing their love affair, Gawain tries to stop them. When Guinevere is sentenced to burn at the stake and Arthur deploys his best knights to guard the execution, Gawain nobly refuses {{to take part in the}} deed even though his brothers will be there. But when Lancelot returns to rescue Guinevere, a battle between Lancelot's and Arthur's knights ensues and Gawain's brothers, except for Mordred, are killed. This turns his friendship with Lancelot into hatred, and his desire for vengeance causes him to draw Arthur into a war with Lancelot in France. In the king's absence, Mordred usurps the throne, and the Britons must return to save Britain. Gawain is mortally wounded in battle against Mordred's armies, and writes to Lancelot apologizing for his actions and asking <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to Britain to help defeat Mordred.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (January 7, 1940) — There {{is more of}} Archie Goodwin than of Nero Wolfe in this book, {{and that}} is all to the good, for, {{although}} Wolfe is Archie's boss and the one who does the heavy thinking, Archie is, unless our guess is wide of the mark, the person whom readers of the Nero Wolfe stories take to their hearts. If Nero is the brains of the concern, Archie is its arms and hands and legs. When Nero wants something done, he does not need to tell Archie how to do it. Archie will figure that out for himself, and the thing is as good as done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that they can do is to watch Nero Wolfe and wait <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> through with the solution. The book is full of surprises for everybody concerned, including not only the reader but also the police, Archie and even Nero Wolfe himself. Read one chapter of this book and you will need no urging to go on with it.|$|E
25|$|Ridgway began each {{murder by}} picking up a woman, usually a sex worker. He {{sometimes}} showed the woman {{a picture of his}} son, to trick her into trusting him. After raping her, Ridgway strangled her from behind. He initially strangled them manually. However, many victims inflicted wounds and bruises on his arm while trying to defend themselves. Concerned these wounds and bruises would draw attention, Ridgway began using ligatures. He killed most victims in his home, his truck, or a secluded area. In the early 1980s, the King County Sheriff's Office formed the Green River Task Force to investigate the murders. The most notable members of the task force were Robert Keppel and Dave Reichert, who periodically interviewed incarcerated serial killer Ted Bundy in 1984. Bundy offered his opinions on the psychology, motivations, and behavior of the killer; he suggested that the killer was revisiting the dump sites to have sexual relations with his victims, {{which turned out to be}} true, and if police found a fresh grave, they should stake it out and wait <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back. Also contributing to the investigation was John E. Douglas, who has since written much on the subject of the Green River Killer.|$|E

25|$|With three {{separate}} {{organizations in the}} confined waters of the lower Mississippi, the fleet command situation was already bad enough, but it began to deteriorate further when the buildup of Farragut's fleet in the lower river became apparent. Flag Officer Hollins was at this time near Memphis, which represented the then-northernmost holdings of the Confederacy on the river, and the Confederate War Department insisted that no effort should be spared to maintain possession. Hollins was sure that the threat from the Gulf was much more severe than Richmond thought, so {{he was prepared to}} listen when General Lovell pleaded <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> down to New Orleans to help in its defense. When there, he sent a telegram to Richmond seeking permission to attack Farragut's ships while they were still lightened to be brought in across the bar. His pleas were so insistent that they virtually amounted to insubordination. Hollins was called to Richmond, ostensibly to serve on an examination board, but in effect to be removed from active service. By default, command of the Confederate Navy vessels in the vicinity of New Orleans fell on the shoulders of Commander William C. Whittle, up to that time commandant of the navy yard there. Whittle did not consider himself able to handle all of his new duties, so on April 18 he passed command of CSS McRae, Jackson, and Manassas, together with their support vessels, to his executive officer, Commander John K. Mitchell. These were all the Confederate Naval vessels afloat at the time; Louisiana and Mississippi had not yet been launched, and were explicitly not controlled by Whittle or Mitchell. Later, when Louisiana was launched but before she was completed, she joined the others in Mitchell's domain.|$|E
25|$|While {{returning}} to Spain, the Niña and Pinta encountered the roughest storm of their journey, and, {{on the night}} of 13 February, lost contact with each other. All hands on the Niña vowed, if they were spared, to make a pilgrimage to the nearest church of Our Lady wherever they first made land. On the morning of February 15, land was spotted. Columbus believed they were approaching the Azore Islands, but other members of the crew felt that they were considerably north of the islands. Columbus turned out to be right. On the night of February 17, the Niña laid anchor at Santa Maria Island, but the cable broke on sharp rocks, forcing Columbus to stay offshore until the morning, when a safer location was found to drop anchor nearby. A few sailors took a boat to the island, where they were told by several islanders of a still safer place to land, so the Niña moved once again. At this spot, Columbus took on board several islanders who had gathered onshore with food, and told them that his crew wished to come ashore to fulfill their vow. The islanders told him that a small shrine dedicated to Our Lady was nearby. Columbus sent half of the crew members to the island to fulfill their vow, but he {{and the rest of the}} crew stayed on the Niña, planning to send the other half to the island upon the return of the first crew members. While the first crew members were saying their prayers at the shrine, they were taken prisoner by the islanders, under orders from the island's captain, João de Castanheira, ostensibly out of fear that the men were pirates. The boat that the crew members had taken to the island was then commandeered by Castanheira, which he took with several armed men to the Niña, in an attempt to arrest Columbus. During a verbal battle across the bows of both craft, during which Columbus did not grant permission <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> aboard, Castanheira announced that he did not believe or care who Columbus said that he was, especially if he was indeed from Spain. Castanheira returned to the island. However, after another two days, Castanheira released the prisoners, having been unable to get confessions from them, and having been unable to capture his real target, Columbus. There are later claims that Columbus was also captured, but this is not backed up by Columbus's log book.|$|E
500|$|... "Mmm Papi" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer-songwriter Britney Spears. The {{song was}} written by Spears and Nicole Morier, while {{additional}} writing and song production were done by Canadian band Let's Go to War, whose members are Henry Walter, Adrien Gough and Peter-John Kerr, for Spears' sixth studio album, Circus (2008). [...] "Mmm Papi" [...] is noted for having a Latin pop influence, similar to Madonna's [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] (1987).

500|$|With the war over, Haber's Kaiser Wilhelm Institute now {{returned}} to research, and Haber offered Franck a job. His new post came with more pay, {{but was not}} a tenured position. It did however allow Franck to pursue his research as he wished. Working with new, younger collaborators such as Walter Grotrian, Paul Knipping, Thea Krüger, Fritz Reiche and Hertha Sponer, his first papers at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute examined atomic electrons in their excited state, results that would later prove important {{in the development of}} the laser. They coined the term [...] "metastable" [...] for atoms spending an extended time in a state other than that of least energy. When Niels Bohr visited Berlin in 1920, Meitner and Franck arranged <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute to talk with the younger staff without the presence of the bonzen ("bigwigs").|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{confessed that}} it was not easy <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up with the lyrics to [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] in that length of time. But two hours later, he had written the verses, and the hook, in spite of being hung over. Harrison had also made {{provision}} for a backing track; he played all the instruments on the track. The bridge was written by Beyoncé, who was inspired by looking at herself in the mirror; as she was not wearing matching clothes and her hair was untidy, she kept saying, [...] "I'm looking so crazy right now." [...] Harrison sang back to her and said, [...] "That's the hook." [...] It also inspired the title of the song. After that Beyoncé had filled up the middle eight, she came up with the catchphrase – [...] "Uh-oh, uh-oh, you know" [...] – alongside Harrison.|$|E
500|$|Michael Buffer, {{the boxing}} ring {{announcer}} {{best known for}} his catchphrase, [...] "Let's get ready to rumble!", made a guest appearance as himself in [...] "Damien". Parker and Stone originally planned to use the catchphrase without Buffer, but when they learned that Buffer had legally trademarked the phrase, they included him in the episode since getting the rights for the catchphrase cost nearly as much as hiring Buffer for a guest appearance. Parker and Stone both said Buffer was friendly and they enjoyed working with him. Voice actor Mike Judge, star of Beavis and Butt-Head and King of the Hill, had originally been slated to provide the voice of the Damien character, and even recorded several lines for the part. However, since Judge lives in Austin, Texas, it proved too difficult to <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back and rerecord lines as the script and episode changed, so Stone instead provided the character's voice.

500|$|During {{the writing}} and {{recording}} of the album, the band encountered several obstacles. Vedder has admitted that while working on the album he suffered from writer's block, which made it difficult <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up with lyrics. This inspired the hidden track [...] "Writer's Block" [...] - which consists of {{the sounds of a}} typewriter - that appears {{at the end of the}} album, starting at 6 minutes and 50 seconds on the track [...] "Parting Ways". Vedder had written music for several songs, including [...] "Insignificance" [...] and [...] "Grievance", but was having trouble coming up with lyrics for the songs. He decided to not write any more music, and to focus only on lyrics, even banning himself from playing guitar. Unable to write more lyrics, Vedder said he saw a ukulele and thought [...] "that's not a guitar," [...] and wrote the song [...] "Soon Forget" [...] using the ukulele. Guitarist Mike McCready went into rehabilitation to receive treatment for an addiction to prescription drugs. Gossard recalled that [...] "everyone wasn't on the same page" [...] due to McCready's absence and the familiarization with Cameron.|$|E
500|$|After {{almost a}} year without work in football, Westley {{returned}} as Stevenage manager in May 2008 – two years after he had originally left. On his return, Westley stated {{he had come to}} [...] "finish the job he started" [...] – referring to trying to guide the club into the Football League {{for the first time in}} its history. He said that [...] "the moment was right" [...] <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back into football and that he [...] "had some very good times at Stevenage before". His appointment was met with a fair bit of scepticism by Stevenage fans, but Westley promised to deliver a winning team, playing attractive football. Westley started by completely overhauling the squad in the summer transfer window and brought in no fewer than twelve players in an attempt to mount a serious Conference Premier title challenge. Among those brought in were Gary Mills and David Bridges, who Westley had managed during his short-stint at Kettering. He also signed Michael Bostwick and Mark Albrighton, who he had also signed at Rushden & Diamonds. Westley also secured the signatures of Andy Drury and Eddie Odhiambo respectively, both of which were players Westley had previously earmarked.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 6 October 1965, Hindley drove Brady to Manchester Central railway station, where she waited outside in the car while he {{selected}} their victim. After a few minutes Brady reappeared {{in the company of}} Edward Evans, to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister. After they had driven back home and relaxed over a bottle of wine, Brady sent Hindley to fetch her brother-in-law. When they got back to the house Hindley told Smith to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light. When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for [...] "the miniature wine bottles". Brady led Smith into the kitchen and left him there, saying {{that he was going to}} collect the wine. A few minutes later, Smith heard a scream, followed by Hindley shouting loudly <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and help. Smith entered the living room to find Brady repeatedly striking Evans with the flat of an axe, and watched as he then throttled Evans with a length of electrical cord. Evans's body was too heavy for Smith to carry to the car on his own—Brady had sprained his ankle in the struggle—so they wrapped it in plastic sheeting and put it in the spare bedroom.|$|E
