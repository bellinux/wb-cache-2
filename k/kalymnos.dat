5|$|Southern Rhodesia was {{represented}} in the Dodecanese Campaign of September–November 1943 by the Long Range Desert Group, which was withdrawn from the North African front in March 1943. After retraining for mountain operations in Lebanon, the LRDG moved in late September to the Dodecanese island of <b>Kalymnos,</b> north-west of Kos and south-east of Leros, {{off the coast of}} south-west Turkey. In the fall-out from the armistice between Italy and the Allies, which had been concluded {{in the first week of}} September, the Allies were attempting to capture the Dodecanese so the islands could be used as bases against the German-occupied Balkans. Most of the Italian forces had changed sides; the LRDG found itself in an infantry role, acting as a mobile reserve for Italian troops.|$|E
5|$|The Germans swiftly mobilised {{to expel}} the Allied forces and {{launched}} heavy air assaults on Kos and Leros. Without fighter support, the islands' defence was soon precarious; the LRDG {{and the rest}} of the troops on <b>Kalymnos</b> were withdrawn to Leros on 4 October after the Germans won the Battle of Kos. German air assaults on Leros intensified during late October, and at dawn on 12 November 1943 the Germans attacked Leros by sea and air. During the ensuing Battle of Leros, the LRDG Rhodesians at Point 320, commanded by Rhodesian Captain JR Olivey, spiked their position's guns and withdrew before counter-attacking and retaking the point the next day. They held that position for three more days, during which they learned that the Germans were winning the battle. On 16 November, Olivey decided that holding the point any longer was pointless and ordered his men to split up, escape by any means possible and re-assemble in Cairo. Over half of the unit reached Egypt.|$|E
25|$|By mid-September, {{however, the}} British 234th Infantry Brigade under Major General F. G. R. Brittorous, coming from Malta, and SBS and LRDG {{detachments}} had secured {{the islands of}} Kos, <b>Kalymnos,</b> Samos, Leros, Symi, and Astypalaia, supported by ships of the British and Greek navies and two RAF Spitfire squadrons on Kos. The Germans quickly mobilised in response. Generalleutnant Friedrich-Wilhelm Müller, {{the commander of the}} 22nd Infantry Division at Crete, was ordered to take Kos and Leros on 23 September.|$|E
25|$|The German forces {{assembling}} for Unternehmen Leopard ("Operation Leopard") {{under the}} command of Generalleutnant Müller, comprised III./Infanterie-Regiment 440, II./IR 16 and II./IR 65 of the 22nd Infantry Division, the parachutists of I./FJR 2, and an amphibious commando company of the Brandenburg Division (1./Küstenjägerabteilung). The invasion force assembled in harbours in Kos and <b>Kalymnos,</b> with reserves and heavy equipment waiting to be airlifted around Athens. Two groups with Ju 87 D3 dive-bombers were available for close air support. I. Group of Schlachtgeschwader 3 flew from their base in Megara and II. Group from Argos and later Rhodos. II. Group of Kampfgeschwader 51 with Ju 88 were available for air strikes.|$|E
25|$|The whole {{event was}} hardly {{reported}} {{by the media and}} it was not widely known to either the Greek or the Turkish public until a month later, on 20 January 1996 when the Greek magazine GRAMMA ran a story, one day after Kostas Simitis was appointed to form the new Greek government as prime minister. The article brought a severe reaction from the Greek press, which was followed by four citizens of the neighboring island of <b>Kalymnos,</b> including the mayor and the owner of a herd of sheep that remained on the islets, hoisting a Greek flag on the larger one (East) of the islets (Great Imia/Kardak or East Imia/Kardak) on 25 January.|$|E
25|$|The {{most notable}} {{aspects of the}} Hellenic Royal Navy's {{participation}} in World War II include {{the operations of the}} destroyer Vassilissa Olga which, until sunk in Leros on September 23, 1943, was the most successful Allied destroyer in the Mediterranean Sea; the participation of two destroyers in Operation Overlord; and the story of the destroyer Adrias, which while operating close to the coast of <b>Kalymnos</b> in October 1943 hit a mine, resulting in the loss of the vessel's prow, while blowing the two-gun forward turret over the bridge. After some minor repairs at Gümüşlük Bay in Turkey the Adrias managed to return to Alexandria in a 400-mile trip, even though all the forepart of the ship, up to the bridge, was missing. Six Greek warships participated in the Sicilian landings and in the subsequent Italian campaign.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of Kos, the Italian {{garrison}} of <b>Kalymnos</b> surrendered, providing the Germans with a valuable base for operations against Leros. Unternehmen Leopard (Operation Leopard), was originally scheduled for 9 October but on 7 October, the Royal Navy intercepted and destroyed the German convoy headed for Kos. Several hundred men {{and most of the}} few German heavy landing craft were lost; replacements were transported by rail, and it was not until 5 November that the Germans had assembled a fleet of 24 light infantry landing craft. To avoid interception by the Allied navies, they were dispersed among several Aegean islands and camouflaged. Despite Allied efforts to locate and sink the invasion fleet, as well as repeated shelling of the ports of German-held islands, the Germans suffered few losses and were able to assemble their invasion force, under Generalleutnant Müller, for Unternehmen Taifun (Operation Typhoon) on 12 November.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 10/11 November, destroyers HMS Petard, Rockwood and ORP Krakowiak bombarded <b>Kalymnos</b> and HMS Faulknor bombarded Kos, where German forces were {{assembling}} for the attack on Leros. The German convoy reached Leros on 12 November, escorted by over 25 ships, mostly submarine chasers, torpedo boats and mineweepers. During the subsequent nights, Allied destroyers failed to find and destroy the German vessels, limiting themselves to bombarding the German positions on Leros. With the fall of Leros on 16 November, the Allied ships were withdrawn, evacuating the remaining British garrisons. By that time, the Germans had also used Dornier Do 217s of Kampfgeschwader 100 (KG 100), with their novel Henschel Hs 293 radio-controlled missile, scoring two hits. One caused severe damage to HMS Rockwood on 11 November; one sank HMS Dulverton two days later. The Allies lost six destroyers sunk and two cruisers and two destroyers damaged between 7 September and 28 November 1943.|$|E
25|$|Despite this setback, the British High Command pressed {{ahead with}} the {{occupation}} of the other islands, especially the three larger ones of Kos, Samos and Leros. The Germans {{were known to be}} overstretched in the Aegean, while the Allies enjoyed superiority at sea and the air cover provided by 7 Squadron, SAAF and 74 Squadron, RAF (Supermarine Spitfires) at Kos was deemed sufficient. It was hoped that from these islands, with Italian cooperation, an assault against Rhodes could be eventually launched. From 10 to 17 September, the 234th Infantry Brigade (Major-General F. G. R. Brittorous) coming from Malta, together with 160 men from the Special Boat Service, 130 men from the Long Range Desert Group, A Company of the 11th Battalion, Parachute Regiment and Greek Sacred Band detachments had secured the islands of Kos, <b>Kalymnos,</b> Samos, Leros, Symi and Astypalaia, supported by ships of the Royal Navy and Royal Hellenic Navy. The Germans quickly mobilized in response. By 19 September, Karpathos, Kasos and the Italian-occupied islands of the Sporades and the Cyclades were in German hands. On 23 September, the 22nd Infantry Division (Lieutenant-General Friedrich-Wilhelm Müller) garrisoning Fortress Crete was ordered to take Kos and Leros.|$|E
500|$|Drache was recommissioned on 20 August 1942 and she {{was renamed}} Schiff 50 on 6 November. She {{conducted}} a number of minelaying operations in the Aegean {{as well as some}} of the west coast of Greece. After the surrender of Italy in September 1943 she was used to carry troops to reconquer the island of Kos on 2–3 October (Operation Eisbär). On 8 October she was unsuccessfully attacked by the British submarine [...] although her companion, the , was sunk. Draches most successful operation was a mine barrage laid just east of the islands of Pserimos and <b>Kalymnos</b> to protect German troops during the Battle of Leros. The British destroyer [...] and the , carrying supplies and reinforcements for the British forces on Leros, ran into this minefield on the evening of 22 October. Adrias had her bow blown off and Hurworth was sunk attempting to come to the aid of Adrias. Adrias, however, was eventually able to make it back to Alexandria. Two nights later the destroyer [...] encountered the same minefield while carrying reinforcements to Leros. She hit a mine, broke in two, and sank in five minutes.|$|E

She fought as an ally of Xerxes I, King of Persia against the independent Greek city states during the second Persian invasion of Greece. She personally commanded her contribution of five ships at the naval battle of Artemisium and in the naval Battle of Salamis in 480 BCE. She is mostly known through the writings of Herodotus, himself a native of Halicarnassus, who praises her courage and the respect in which Xerxes held her.|$|E
2500|$|Underwater {{diving for}} {{commercial}} purposes may have begun in Ancient Greece, since both Plato and Homer mention the sponge as being used for bathing. The island of <b>Kalymnos</b> was a main centre of diving for sponges.

Sponges were not the only valuable harvest to be found on the sea floor; the harvesting of red coral was also quite popular. A variety of valuable shells or fish could be harvested in this way, creating a demand for divers to harvest the treasures of the sea, which could also include the sunken riches of other seafarers.|$|E
2500|$|On 14 September, {{the first}} Allied loss occurred, when the Greek {{submarine}} RHN Katsonis, was rammed and sunk by U-boat hunter UJ 2101.

At the same time, the short range of Hunt-class destroyers , RHN Pindos and RHN Themistoklis {{prevented them from}} intercepting the German invasion convoy headed for Kos. Further losses on both sides followed; after the loss of Kos and friendly air cover, the Allied navies concentrated on supply missions to the threatened islands of Leros and Samos, mostly {{under the cover of}} night.
