The concept, definition and legal status of water resources are presented in the introduction, as the basis for an analysis of the possibility of <b>disposing</b> of, or limiting the disposal of, water resources.

40|$|Ankara : The Department of Management, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent Univ., 2013. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Bilkent University, 2013. Includes bibliographical refences. Recently, <b>disposing</b> has {{attracted}} lots of research attention. While some researchers frame <b>disposing</b> as {{a practice of}} ordering, identity management, and psychological relief, others associate it with overconsumption, waste of usable resources, and environmental hazard. Although <b>disposing</b> is related to such seemingly conflicting meanings and consumption practices, consumer researchers mostly bypass the broader structures, grand practices, and ideological and discursive meaning systems underlying <b>disposing</b> practices. Using ethnographic methods, this study explores <b>disposing</b> as a mundane practice, embedded in contexts with socio-cultural, economic, historical, and political dimensions. The research aims to reveal when and how consumers practice <b>disposing</b> by highlighting the normative and ideological structures that help constructing these practices. It also aims {{to shed light on}} how <b>disposing</b> might relate to other consumption practices. The results depict <b>disposing</b> as embedded in four meta-practices at the intersection of various tensions and ideologies feeding these. Steeped in these grand discourses of consumption, <b>disposing</b> helps moralizing consumption and allows consumers to experience morality without standing against consumerism or adopting new lifestyles. Rather than just facilitating consumer resistance, <b>disposing</b> also helps consumers to compromise with the market. The results complicate the linear framing of consuming as acquiring-using-disposing by highlighting how <b>disposing</b> reflects on the object’s consumption and is constructive of its value. The study also reveals new practices through which consumers negotiate <b>disposing</b> and highlight a new dimension of object attachment. The results have important implications for the disposition, moral consumption, and value research. Türe, MeltemPh. D...|$|R
