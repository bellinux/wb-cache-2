5|$|Bismuth {{oxychloride}} (BiOCl, {{see figure}} at right) and bismuth oxynitrate (BiONO3) stoichiometrically appear as simple anionic salts of the bismuthyl(III) cation (BiO+) which commonly occurs in aqueous bismuth compounds. However, {{in the case}} of BiOCl, the salt crystal <b>forms</b> <b>in</b> a structure of alternating plates of Bi, O, and Cl atoms, with each oxygen coordinating with four bismuth atoms in the adjacent plane. This mineral compound is used as a pigment and cosmetic (see below).|$|E
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, a number of bands from Louisiana (particularly New Orleans with its metal scene) took these influences and developed the style that would be known as sludge, [...] specifically Eyehategod (<b>formed</b> <b>in</b> 1988), Crowbar (<b>formed</b> <b>in</b> 1989 as The Slugs) and Acid Bath (<b>formed</b> <b>in</b> 1991). On the East Coast, Buzzov*en (<b>formed</b> <b>in</b> 1989), 16 (<b>formed</b> <b>in</b> 1990) and Grief (<b>formed</b> <b>in</b> 1991) adopted a slower-paced approach to the emerging genre.|$|R

He joined the Royal Navy, and while serving in Malta was spotted playing for a Navy team by a Plymouth Argyle supporter, who recommended him to the club.

5|$|Calabria, alone, has 30 {{traditional}} musical instruments, some {{of which}} have strongly archaic characteristics and are largely extinct elsewhere in Italy.

A one-stringed, bowed fiddle called the torototela, is common in the northeast of the country. The largely German-speaking area of South Tyrol is known for the zither, and the ghironda (hurdy-gurdy) is found in Emilia, Piedmont and Lombardy.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of the de novo pathway, the salvage reactions are essential in humans; a lack of niacin in the diet causes the vitamin deficiency disease pellagra. This high requirement for NAD results from the constant consumption of the coenzyme in reactions such as posttranslational modifications, since the cycling of NAD between oxidized and reduced <b>forms</b> <b>in</b> redox reactions does not change the overall levels of the coenzyme.|$|E
5|$|Electrons {{are thought}} {{to exist in the}} Universe since early stages of the Big Bang. Atomic nuclei <b>forms</b> <b>in</b> {{nucleosynthesis}} reactions.

5|$|For Halo 3, it {{was decided}} a new visual {{language}} for the Flood was needed. The task of developing the new Flood forms, organic Flood terrain, and other miscellaneous changes fell to Vic DeLeon, Bungie's Senior Environment Artist. With the addition of mutable <b>forms</b> <b>in</b> Halo 3, the only fictional constraint on the designer's imaginations was that the Flood altered the DNA of its victims by digesting.|$|E

5|$|Old English is very {{different}} from Modern English and difficult for 21st-century English speakers to understand.

Modern English has case <b>forms</b> <b>in</b> pronouns (he, him, his) and a few verb endings (I have, he has), but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more person and number endings.|$|E
