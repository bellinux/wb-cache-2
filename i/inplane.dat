50|$|Commercial EDWA {{development}} efforts intensified in 2000's when <b>Inplane</b> Photonics joined the race. In general, their approach {{was similar to}} that of Bell Labs, i.e. the silica-on-silicon technology. <b>Inplane</b> Photonics, however, was able to further improve and expand capabilities of this technology by integrating two to three different waveguide types on the same chip. This feature allowed them to monolithically integrate gain blocks (active waveguides providing amplification) with different passive elements, such as couplers, arrayed waveguide gratings (AWG), optical taps, turning mirrors and so on. Some of advanced <b>Inplane</b> Photonics' photonic circuits containing EDWAs were used by Lockheed Martin in their development of new high-speed on-board communication systems for the US Air Force. <b>Inplane</b> Photonics and its technology was later acquired by CyOptics.|$|E

50|$|Layers of {{different}} materials may be used, {{resulting in a}} hybrid laminate. The individual layers generally are orthotropic (that is, with principal properties in orthogonal directions) or transversely isotropic (with isotropic properties in the transverse plane) with the laminate then exhibiting anisotropic (with variable direction of principal properties), orthotropic, or quasi-isotropic properties. Quasi-isotropic laminates exhibit isotropic (that is, independent of direction) <b>inplane</b> response but are not restricted to isotropic out-of-plane (bending) response. Depending upon the stacking sequence of the individual layers, the laminate may exhibit coupling between <b>inplane</b> and out-of-plane response.

50|$|Another {{failure mode}} {{that may occur}} without any tearing is ductile {{fracture}} after plastic deformation (ductility). This may occur {{as a result of}} bending or shear deformation (<b>inplane</b> or through the thickness). The failure mechanism may be due to void nucleation and expansion on a microscopic level. Microcracks and subsequent macrocracks may appear when deformation of the material between the voids has exceeded the limit. Extensive research has focused in recent years on understanding and modeling ductile fracture. The approach has been to identify ductile forming limits using various small-scale tests that show different strain ratios or stress triaxialities. An effective measure of this type of forming limit is the minimum radius in roll-forming applications (half the sheet thickness for materials with good and three times the sheet thickness for materials with low formability).|$|E
5000|$|Defect sites can {{interfere}} with the stability of metal oxide surfaces, so {{it is important to}} locate and determine methods to control these sites. Oxides exhibit an abundance of point defect sites. In rocksalt surfaces, oxygen and metal cation vacancies are the most common point defects. The vacancies are produced by electron bombardment and annealing to extremely high temperatures. However, oxygen vacancies are more common and have a greater impact than metal cation vacancies. Oxygen vacancies cause reduction in between surface cations, which significantly affect the electronic energy levels. Steps and kinks are two other defects that impact rocksalt surfaces. These structural defects reduce the coordination environment of the four adjacent surface cations from 5 to 4. In rutile surfaces, {{the most common type of}} defect is oxygen vacancies. There are two types of oxygen vacancies, which result from either the removal of a bridging O2− ions or the removal of an <b>inplane</b> O2− ion. Both of these will reduce the coordination of the surface cations.http://www.ndt-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Materials/Structure/point_defects.htm ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to conduct a parametric investigation on the aeromechanic stability of modern bearingless rotors. To ensure aeromechanic stability, modem bearingless; rotors use elastomeric dampers to augment the blade <b>inplane</b> damping. The augmented dampers are necessary to avoid aeromechanic instabilities such as air and ground resonance on soft-inplane rotors. The prevention of air and ground resonance depends largely on the damping level of the rotor-fuselage system during the critical frequency-crossing between the rotor and the fuselage <b>inplane</b> motions.

BACKGROUND Laminated composite plates are often modelled using the classical laminate plate theory (CLPT) or the first-order shear deformation plate theory (FSDT). In both cases the laminate is treated as a single-layer plate with equivalent stiffnesses, and the displacements are assumed to vary through the thickness according to a single expression (see Reddy 1), not allowing for possible discontinuities in strains at an interface of dissimilar material layers. Recently, Reddy 2 presented a general laminate plate theory that allows layer-wise representation of <b>inplane</b> displacements, and an improved response of <b>inplane</b> and transverse shear deformations is predicted. Similar but different theories have appeared in the literature. 3 -...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{influence}} of the <b>inplane</b> boundary conditions on the vibration frequencies and the buckling load of plates reinforced with a system of parallel beams is presented.

The analysis consists in isolating the beams from the plate by sections parallel to the lower outer surface of the plate. The analysis of the vibration problem of a ribbed plate subjected to <b>inplane</b> forces is based on the capability to establish a flexibility matrix with respect to a set of nodal mass points using the Analog Equation Method (AEM) for the static ribbed plate problem.
