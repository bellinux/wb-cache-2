50|$|A traveling-nut linear {{actuator}} has a motor that stays attached to {{one end of}} the lead screw (perhaps indirectly through a gear box), the motor spins the lead screw, and the <b>lead</b> <b>nut</b> is restrained from spinning so it travels up and down the lead screw.|$|R
50|$|The {{position}} of the moving platform relative to the fixed base is typically controlled by a linear actuator of some form, whether manual, motorized, or hydraulic/pneumatic. The most common method is to incorporate a lead screw passing through a <b>lead</b> <b>nut</b> in the platform. The rotation of such a lead screw may be controlled either manually or by a motor.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: To {{solve the}} {{interference}} problem during the grinding process of large <b>lead</b> ball <b>nut,</b> a new forming grinding {{system based on}} flexible shaft has been designed in this paper. The paper analyzed and compared with three grinding methods including reducing setting angle, deflecting setting angle and adopting flexible shaft grinding system to figure out their influence on possibility, precision and efficiency of grinding. The result shows that the flexible shaft grinding system designed can avoid interference effectively. Additionally, it can also meet the requirement of efficiency and precision when grinding the large <b>lead</b> ball <b>nut...</b>|$|R

50|$|Most {{electro-mechanical}} designs {{incorporate a}} lead screw and <b>lead</b> <b>nut.</b> Some use a ball screw and ball nut. In either case the screw may be connected to a motor or manual control knob either directly or {{through a series of}} gears. Gears are typically used to allow a smaller (and weaker) motor spinning at a higher rpm to be geared down to provide the torque necessary to spin the screw under a heavier load than the motor would otherwise be capable of driving directly. Effectively this sacrifices actuator speed in favor of increased actuator thrust. In some applications the use of worm gear is common as this allow a smaller built in dimension still allowing great travel length.|$|R
