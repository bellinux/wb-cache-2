50|$|The {{start of}} heading (SOH) {{character}} was to mark a non-data section of a data stream—the part of a stream containing addresses and other housekeeping data. The start of text character (STX) {{marked the end of}} the header, and the start of the textual part of a stream. The <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> <b>character</b> (ETX) marked the end of the data of a message. A widely used convention is to make the two characters preceding ETX a checksum or CRC for error-detection purposes. The end of transmission block character (ETB) was used to indicate the end of a block of data, where data was divided into such blocks for transmission purposes.|$|E

We {{present a}} highly {{accurate}} method for classifying web pages based on link percentage, {{which is the}} percentage <b>of</b> <b>text</b> <b>characters</b> that are parts of links normalized by the number <b>of</b> all <b>text</b> <b>characters</b> on a web page. We also present a novel link grouping algorithm using agglomerative hierarchical clustering that groups links in the same spatial neighborhood together while preserving link structure. Grouping allows users with severe disabilities to use a scan-based mechanism to tab through a web page and select items. In experiments, we saw up to a 40 -fold {{reduction in the number}} of commands needed to click on a link with a scan-based interface. Our classification method consistently outperformed a baseline classifier even when using minimal data to generate article and index clusters, and achieved classification accuracy of 94. 0 % on web sites with well-formed or slightly malformed HTML, compared with 80. 1 % accuracy for the baseline classifier...|$|R

50|$|The {{widespread}} {{usage of}} ASCII {{art can be}} traced to the computer bulletin board systems of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The limitations of computers of that time period necessitated the use <b>of</b> <b>text</b> <b>characters</b> to represent images. Along with ASCII's use in communication, however, it also began to appear in the underground online art groups of the period. An ASCII comic is a form of webcomic which uses ASCII text to create images. In place of images in a regular comic, ASCII art is used, with the text or dialog usually placed underneath.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Text {{information}} in natural scene images serves as important clues for many image-based {{applications such as}} scene understanding, content-based image retrieval, assistive navigation, and automatic geocoding. However, locating text from complex background with multiple colors is a challenging task. In this paper, we explore a new framework to detect text strings with arbitrary orientations in complex natural scene images. Our proposed framework <b>of</b> <b>text</b> string detection consists of two steps: 1) Image partition to find <b>text</b> <b>character</b> candidates based on local gradient features and color uniformity of character components. 2) Character candidate grouping to detect text strings based on joint structural features <b>of</b> <b>text</b> <b>characters</b> in each <b>text</b> string such as character size differences, distances between neighboring characters, and character alignment. By assuming that a text string has at least three characters, we propose two algorithms o...|$|R

40|$|Stripes {{are common}} sub-structures <b>of</b> <b>text</b> <b>characters,</b> and {{the scale of}} these stripes varies little within a word. This scale {{consistency}} thus provides us with a useful feature for text detection and segmentation. In this paper {{a new form of}} filter is derived from the Gabor filter, and it is shown this filter can efficiently estimate the scales of these stripes. The contrast <b>of</b> <b>text</b> in video can then be increased by enhancing the edges of only those stripes found to correspond to a suitable scale. More specifically the algorithm presented here enhances the stripes in three pre-selected scale ranges. The resulting enhancement yields much better performance from the binarization process, which is the step required before character recognition. 1...|$|R
