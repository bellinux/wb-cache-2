5|$|Francois Fillon then visited Guadaloupe {{and brought}} with him a team of experts from the Ministry of the Interior to assess the nature and cost of the <b>damage.</b> <b>The</b> local {{government}} reported to them that 75% of Guadeloupe's banana plantations, valued at €100million, were totally destroyed. Despite promises by Overseas Minister Christian Estrosi that all problems would be resolved within three months, it took over six months to restart banana production, and several more to restore lost capacity.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} of <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> detection methods depending on the data measured by strain and deflection sensors. The experimental work considers <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> detection by measured data only without the baseline data of intact structure. It is shown that the strain sensor cannot indicate <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> if <b>the</b> sensor doesn’t locate at <b>the</b> <b>damage.</b> But <b>the</b> deflection sensor provides the information on <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> from <b>the</b> deflected curve by collected data. The results are illustrated in experimental work...|$|R
50|$|A 1993 truck {{accident}} <b>damaged</b> <b>the</b> bridge, requiring {{repairs to}} its guardrails. In 2006 a truck caused <b>damage</b> to <b>the</b> bridge's support beams in another accident; <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> was repaired within a week.|$|R
