The material used this research Bali Cows breeders of Sub-District Suai, 135 Bali Cows breeders total population cattle 982 cows. The method used the reseach survey is interviewed respondents. and sampling in proportional sampling means sampling based on certain considerations, based on the amount of Balinese cattle rearing in each village in 7 districts. Sample used 11. Primary data was obtained by direct observation of the activities of Bali Cows and interviews with respondents, using questionnaires. Secondary data is obtained the office Village or related institutions. Identification breeders is needed to know the social breeders include name, age, occupation, responsibility of family and business livestock this need to know because it is very closely related to the activities of cultivation of cattle. Samples were taken by 135 respondents from Debus, Loro, Mane Ikun, Babo, Asu Mate and Asurai villages in Sub-District Suai worked on cultivation and fattening cows. The results showed that the value of cattle in one year ago. The benefits gained by cattle ranchers in SubDistrict Suai, increase in cattle value increased a year later. From the data of 135 respondents known the number of calves 269, female 460 and male 253 of the total number of cows 982 tail. Based on these data, the average number of breeder cows is calf 2, 1, female 3. 4 and male 1. 9. If the parent price is $ 75, buy $. 25 and male $ 40 then total of the initial asset value of the year average cow per breeder is $ 3, 535. The highest value of a female cow is $ 2. 25, because all breeders maintain a female cow of 3 - 4 head and the lowest is the cattle value of the seedlings of $. 525. Total receipts by breeders with total explicit costs. The average income of breeder cattle breeding is $ 2, 278. 4 (direct receipts, <b>indirect</b> <b>receipts),</b> less explicit cost of $ 63. 6 so that the average income earned by farmers is $ 2214. 8. From the results of the study concluded that the cost incurred for the livestock business for one year of $ 1, 703. 6. The output value obtained during the maintenance period is $ 2, 278. 4. So the amount of profits earned $ 574. 8. Keywords: Analysis of Bali Extensive Cattle Breeding Busines...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{appeared}} in ‘The Economic background to the Gulf War’, in Yuval-Davis,N and Bresheeth,H (eds) The Gulf War and the New World Order, pp 153 - 162. London: Zed Press ISBN 1 85649 041 6; 1 85649 042 4 The book, a landmark in dissent against the conflagration {{that has become}} the war in Iraq, collated works from scholars throughout the world who sought to penetrate the rhetoric of war, and understand its economic and political causes. In this chapter I sought to give meaning to the idea that the war had economic causes, going however beyond simplistic formulations of direct and immediate economic interest. The First Gulf War, as we now know it to have been, was not just about oil. It was, I argued in this chapter, about the disintegration of the entire postwar order. This order, although it was established by military victory and defeat, rested on profound economic relations, most notably hegemony over surplus profit arising from three principal sources: *the technical superprofit arising from the superior productivity of the ‘advanced’ countries as a whole, in the appropriation of which the USA and Germany established dominance during the long decline of UK hegemony *commercial superprofit enjoyed within the ‘spheres of influence’ of the victorious powers, domination over the world market as a whole having been fragmented by the Russian and Chinese revolutions and subsequently (to a lesser degree) the realisation of colonial independence and the formation of the non-aligned bloc – as expressed in the suspension until 1982 of the project of constructing the WTO *the financial superprofit enjoyed in partnership by the victorious powers and expressed (including the relation of forces within the partnership) in the Bretton Woods settlement The chapter argued that the war was provoked, fundamentally, by the decline in the relative productive advantage with which the US emerged from WWII, provoked primarily by the rise of Japan and Germany and expressed in the inexorably growing US deficit. The US, I argued, had been driven to try and reconstruct the world order {{in such a way as}} to claw back this loss through an ever-growing monopoly of the second two sources of superprofit – commercial and financial superprofit. The maintenance of these depended on the direct assertion of political and specifically military force – the true driver behind the USA’s ever more violent military stance in world politics. This reorganisation however had provoked an extremely rapid rise in poverty, as the US sought to compensate both for its trade deficit, and for its weaknesses vis-à-vis its rivals (Germany and Japan) by ramping up its direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>receipts</b> from the third world. This drastic impoverishment was creating the crises of governance that drove the US to re-enforce its flagging hegemony by more and more directly interventionist means. ...|$|E

Analisa-se também a forma como a experiência dos utilizadores da internet influência duma forma direta e indireta a receção de mensagens eletrónicas (eWOM – electronic word-of-mouth). Foi utilizada uma amostragem de 200 inquiridos, maioritariamente Portugueses. Os dados foram analisados recorrendo aos softwares estatísticos SPSS 21 e Lisrel 8. 8. Os resultados realçam a importância do consumo e o encaminhamento de notícias sobre eventos terroristas e, surpreendentemente a influência negativa do eWOM sobre a partilha de notícias na internet. Futuramente, as organizações devem aumentar e dar maior notoriedade à credibilidade das informações sobre eventos terroristas, isto terá implicações positivas na atenção e na curiosidade prestada pelos consumidores acerca de conteúdos sobre terrorismo.

Population health is not only fundamental to economic growth but also affects short-term and long-term government expenditure on health care, disability, and other social programs and influences direct and <b>indirect</b> tax <b>receipts.</b> Fiscal transfers between citizen and state are mostly ignored in conventional welfare economics analyses based on the hypothesis {{that there are no}} winners or losers through transference of wealth. However, from the government perspective, this position is flawed, as disability costs and lost taxes attributed to poor health and reduced productive output represent real costs that pose budgetary and growth implications. To address the value of health and health care investments for government, we have developed a fiscal health analytic framework that captures how changes in morbidity and mortality influence tax revenue and transfer costs (e. g., disability, allowances, ongoing health costs). The framework can be used to evaluate the marginal impact of discrete investments or a mix of interventions in health care to inform governmental budgetary consequences. In this context, the framework can be considered as a fiscal budget impact and/or cost benefit analysis model that accounts for how morbidity and mortality linked to specific programs represent both ongoing costs and tax revenue for government. Mathematical models identical to those used in cost-effectiveness analyses can be employed in fiscal analysis to reflect how disease progression influences public accounts (e. g., tax revenue and transfers) ...|$|R
