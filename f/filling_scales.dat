Multi-threaded components for wiring and simulation combine 8 cores per MPI process to achieve excellent scaling. K is capable of simulating networks corresponding to a brain area with 108 neurons and 1012 synapses in the worst case scenario of random connectivity; for larger networks of the brain its hierarchical organization can be exploited to constrain the number of communicating computer nodes. We discuss the limits of the software technology, comparing maximum <b>filling</b> <b>scaling</b> plots for K and the JUGENE BG/P system.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} of the adequacy of Computational fluid dynamics (CFD), using a standard Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) model, for predicting dispersion of neutrally buoyant gas in a large indoor space. We used CFD to predict pollutant (dye) concentration profiles in a water <b>filled</b> <b>scale</b> model of an atrium with a continuous pollutant source. Predictions from the RANS formulation are comparable to an ensemble average of independent identical experiments. Model results were compared to pollutant concentration data in a horizontal plane from experiments in a scale model atrium. Predictions were made for steady-state (fully developed) and transient (developing) pollutant concentrations. Agreement between CFD predictions and ensemble averaged experimental measurements is quantified using the ratios of CFD-predicted and experimentally measured dye concentration at a large number of points in the measurement plane. Agreement is considered good if these ratios fall between 0. 5 and 2. 0 at all points in the plane. The standard k-epsilon two equation turbulence model obtains this level of agreement and predicts pollutant arrival time to the measurement plane within a few seconds. These results suggest that this modeling approach is adequate for predicting isothermal pollutant transport in a large room with simple geometry...|$|R

The large aperture diagnostic system or LADS, is now being built through a collaborative effort between CEL-V and LLNL. The LADS will provide measurements of gain and wave front distortions over the fill extracting aperture of the NIF and LMJ prototype amplifiers.

40|$|Numerical {{models have}} been {{developed}} to adequately simulate three dimensional flow around obstructions, such as bridge piers, in the flow field. Previously, however, sediment transport formulas available for predicting scour were developed for general scour in unobstructed flow. The capability for numerical models to predict local scour around bridge piers was severely restricted by the sediment transport formulas. This paper describes a new effective Sediment Transport Capacity (STC) formula which accounts for the dominate factors-diving currents, strong vortices and high turbulence-which characterize the local scour process. The new formula adds a new term to a classic sediment transport formula from the Chinese literature. Coefficients for the added term were derived from physical laboratory experimental data and it becomes zero when there is no flow obstruction. That means that the new formula can be used for both general scour and local scour when incorporated into a reliable numerical flow model. The new formula has been tested against independent physical model results and applied to a <b>fill</b> <b>scale</b> study of the proposed Woodrow Wilson replacement bridge. Results from the Woodrow Wilson bridge study are presented in this paper. This paper presents an analogy between the Sediment Transport Capacity and StreamPower and shows that they are directly related. Just as an effective Sediment Transport Capacity is needed to predict local scour with a numerical model, an effective Stream Power is needed to analyze local scour with empirical methods...|$|R
40|$|Building an {{intimate}} relationship is a challenge especially now when available alternatives to ongoing relationship have increased. So, {{it is important for}} the next researches focus on the way in which Self can coordinating and tuning with partner feelings and emotions. For this reason, we utilized intersubjectivity construct and applied to the field of close relationships (Beebe and Lachmann, 2003). We refer intersubjectivity to the mental space that occurs between two minds, both characterized by positive and negative correspondence. Usually studied in the dyadic relation between caregiver and child (Ammaniti, Gallese, 2014), we are trying to study intersubjectivity inside the close relationships. Our study is focused on the possibility that intersubjectivity implies to share emotions and affects, overcoming the inevitable disconnection processes, so evident in destructive conflicts. We elaborated a new measure, couple intersubjectivity, with the aim to evaluate positive correspondence between partners in 100 heterosexual committed couples. Besides, subjects <b>filled</b> <b>scales</b> of empathy and closeness to measure concurrent validity and test construct validity of couple intersubjectivity. Results showed that own capacity to stay tuned with the partner influences directly couple satisfaction. We found small effect for the interactive perspective but no evidence for the correlation between partner perspective and own couple satisfaction. Again, we found that quality of alternatives is an important mediator between self-intersubjectivity and couple satisfaction. We discussed our results in order to develop an intervention on conflictual and destructive couples...|$|R

40|$|Differences in the {{allometric}} scaling between gut capacity (with body mass, BM 1. 00) {{and food}} intake (with BM 0. 75) should theoretically {{result in a}} scaling of digesta retention time with BM 0. 25 and therefore a higher digestive efficiency in larger herbivores. This concept {{is an important part}} of the so-called ‘Jarman-Bell principle’ (JBP) that explains niche differentiation along a body size gradient in terms of digestive physiology. Empirical data in herbivorous mammals, however, do not confirm the scaling of retention time, or of digestive efficiency, with body mass. Here, we test these concepts in herbivorous reptiles, adding data of an experiment that measured food intake, digesta retention, digestibility and gut capacity in 23 tortoises (Testudo graeca, T. hermanni, Geochelone nigra, G. sulcata, Dipsochelys dussumieri) across a large BM range (0. 5 - 180 kg) to a literature data collection. While dry matter gut <b>fill</b> <b>scaled</b> to BM 1. 07 and dry matter intake to BM 0. 76, digesta mean retention time (MRT) scaled to BM 0. 17; the scaling exponent was not significantly different from zero for species > 1 kg. Food intake level was a major determinant of MRT across reptiles and mammals. In contrast to dietary fibre level, BM was not a significant contributor to dry matter digestibility in a General Linear Model. Digestibility coefficients in reptiles depended on diet nutrient composition in a similar way as described in mammals. Although food intake is generally lower and digesta retention longer in reptiles than in mammals, digestive functions scale in a similar way in both clades, indicating universal principles in herbivore digestive physiology. The reasons why the theoretically derived JBP has little empirical support remain to be investigated. Until then, the JBP should not be evoked to explain niche differentiation along a body size axis in terms of digestive physiology...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the use of modulated solar shielding {{in the context of}} solar radiation control in hot-dry and semi-arid climates. Solar shielding refers to the solar protection of the entire or large parts of the building's external fabric and not just those elements which directly transmit solar radiation. The study was undertaken with particular reference to the hot semi-arid climate of northern Nigeria. A conceptual and climatic analysis provided a contextual background for the work. A study of the use of shading devices indicated that their strength in some climates may be their weakness in others, especially the hot dry and semi and climates. A multiplicity of inherent climatic and environmental elements were not fully addressed by formal shading techniques. The concept of solar shielding was conceived from the interplay of the climatic and environmental factors of hot dry and semi-axid lands. Lack of measured solar radiation data in the reference climate necessitated the development of an interactive computer program to generate this and other relevant design data. A literature review provided a theoretical foundation un- derpining a series of full scale field measurements, scale model experimentation and thermal simulation studies. <b>Fill</b> <b>scale</b> measurements in a building were instructive on a possible impact of solar shielding on indoor thermal conditions. Model scale wind tunnel tests on the reference building and studies on full size louvres, using a pressurisation test facility, culminated in the development of airflow models through louvres. Finally, parametric thermal modelling studies enabled not only the optimisation of the technique but also a comparison with formal shading methods. Measured and simulated data portrayed not only a significant agreement but also indicated that solar shielding could have a higher solar protection efficiency than shading devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{backlash}} avoidance model (BAM) suggests women insufficiently self-promote {{because they}} fear backlash for behavior which is incongruent with traditional gender roles. Avoiding self-promoting behavior is also potentially related to associating success with negative consequences. In two studies we tested whether self-promotion and fear of success will be predictors of lower salaries and anticipation of lower chances of success in an exam. In study 1, prior to the exam {{they were about to}} take, we asked 234 students about their predictions concerning exam results and their future earnings. They also <b>filled</b> <b>scales</b> measuring their associations with success (fear of success) and tendency for self-promotion. The tested model proved that in comparison to men, women expect lower salaries in the future, anticipate lower test performance and associate success with more negative consequences. Both tendency for self-promotion and fear of success are related to anticipation of success in test performance and expectations concerning future earnings. In study 2 we repeated the procedure on a sample of younger female and male high school pupils (N = 100) to verify whether associating success with negative consequences and differences in self-promotion strategies are observable in a younger demographic. Our results show that girls and boys in high school do not differ with regard to fear of success, self-promotion or agency levels. Girls and boys anticipated to obtain similar results in math exam results, but girls expected to have higher results in language exams. Nevertheless, school pupils also differed regarding their future earnings but only in the short term. Fear of success and agency self-ratings were significant predictors of expectations concerning future earnings, but only among high school boys and with regard to earnings expected just after graduation...|$|R
