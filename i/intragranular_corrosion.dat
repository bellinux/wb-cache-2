40|$|Abstract. Alternate immersion-emersion {{tests were}} {{performed}} for a 2050 aluminium alloy to characterize its corrosion resistance with exposure conditions representative of in service-conditions. Tests were performed for T 34 samples and aged samples. After continuous immersion tests, T 34 samples exhibited intergranular corrosion while <b>intragranular</b> <b>corrosion</b> was observed for aged samples. The alternate immersion-emersion tests {{led to a}} corrosion extension to the subgrain boundaries, for both T 34 and aged samples, as shown by electron backscattered diffraction analysis...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{corrosion}} {{behavior of}} aluminum alloy 2050 was studied {{as a function}} of varying conditions of exposure to an aqueous NaCl solution. Two metallurgical states were considered, i. e., an as-received alloy (NHT) and aged samples (HT). After continuous immersion tests, the NHT samples were susceptible to intergranular corrosion, whereas <b>intragranular</b> <b>corrosion</b> was observed for the HT samples. For the NHT samples, cyclic corrosion tests, with alternate immersion - emersion periods, induced subgrain boundary dissolution, and for the HT samples, grain and/or subgrain boundary sensibilization was induced. Hydrogen content measurements suggested a hydrogen enrichment of the alloy under cyclic corrosion tests...|$|E

The {{results showed that}} the nugget was susceptible to both intergranular and <b>intragranular</b> <b>corrosion.</b> Such corrosion behaviour was related to microstructural heterogeneities observed on a microscopic scale. Furthermore, heterogeneities in the corrosion behaviour of the nugget observed on a macroscopic scale were evidenced by a different corrosion behaviour from the top {{to the bottom of the}} nugget and by a localisation of the corrosion damage related to the ''Onion ring structure''. Critical microstructural parameters were identified to explain the results...|$|E

40|$|Friction-surface {{processing}} (FSP) was explored as {{a possible}} method for mitigating corrosion of a friction-stir weld (FSW) in the Al-Li-Cu alloy AA 2050 -T 851. The microstructure, hardness and corrosion behaviour of the base alloy, the FSW and the FSP regions was examined. The base alloy showed susceptibility to pitting parallel to the rolling direction and some <b>intragranular</b> <b>corrosion,</b> but no susceptibility to intergranular corrosion (IGC) or exfoliation corrosion. The FSW showed evidence of IGC in the nugget region and thermomechanically-affected zone (TMAZ), and exfoliation corrosion in the heat-affected zone (HAZ). Regions of the base alloy that had been treated by FSP also showed some IGC. Treatment of the FSW with FSP showed some indication of a reduction of IGC, {{and there was no}} evidence of exfoliation corrosion in the FSP-treated FSW-HAZ, but further work needs to be carried out to confirm this...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe fatigue {{behaviour}} of Aluminium–Copper–Lithium 2050 alloy {{under two}} metallurgical states (T 34 and T 84) was studied in air for healthy and pre-corroded samples in a 0. 7 NaCl solution. The results {{were compared to}} those obtained during fatigue–corrosion tests performed in a similar chloride medium. Preliminary corrosion tests demonstrated that the T 34 metallurgical state was susceptible to intergranular corrosion, while the T 84 metallurgical state was susceptible to <b>intragranular</b> <b>corrosion.</b> Fatigue life tests in air on pre-corroded samples revealed {{a significant decrease in}} fatigue life related to the presence of corrosion defects before the cyclic solicitation. A strong effect of the first minutes of immersion in corrosive media was evidenced on fatigue life behaviour. The fatigue–corrosion tests revealed that the T 34 metallurgical state was more affected by fatigue–corrosion in terms of fatigue life than the T 84 metallurgical state. This observation {{can be explained by the}} increased propagation of intergranular corrosion enhanced by the cyclic solicitation...|$|E
40|$|Microstructure {{is one of}} the {{critical}} factors that can dictate the corrosion of aluminium alloys. When a heat treatable aluminium alloy undergoes ageing, the evolution of microstructure may cause extensive changes in the corresponding corrosion behaviour. When using electrochemical test methods, the corrosion response of Al-alloys can be assessed by relating the electrochemical response with microstructural evolution and features. This work presents an attempt to research the relationship between electrochemically determined pitting and the precipitate microstructure of AA 2050, a contemporary Al-Cu-Li aerospace alloy. It is revealed that AA 2050 has a peculiar corrosion behaviour with respect to other age hardenable Al-alloys. During low temperature ageing, the corrosion morphology of AA 2050 changes from intergranular corrosion (IGC) to <b>intragranular</b> <b>corrosion</b> then back to intergranular corrosion with prolonged aging. To understand the mechanism of the corrosion morphology evolution, AA 2050 samples with 11 different ageing conditions were tested. Electrochemical polarisation (potentiodynamic and potentiostatic), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Scanning Auger microprobe (SAM) analysis, microhardness and immersion testing were performed on the samples. The relationships between microstructure, electrochemical response and the corrosion morphology of samples with different heat treatment conditions were studied. As the corrosion mechanism of AA 2050 is unique, this work makes an initial contribution to the salient points of the corrosion of such alloys. Several possible hypotheses are given to rationalise an apparent contrariness between the observed microstructure and the corrosion/electrochemical behaviours. Of key relevance, is that the alloy appears to be immune to conventional (nanostructure driven) pitting, owing to a persistently fine precipitate width, whilst solute segregation – studied to some degree herein – of Li, remains a challenge to detect and will be required in the future for a complete assessment of the alloy performance...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of an external mechanical stress on the corrosion behaviour of a Friction Sir Welding butt joint. In {{order to understand the}} corrosion behaviour of the whole welded joint, some zones have been removed and studied individually. A welded joint was obtained by joining together two plate of aluminium-lithium alloy 2050 -T 3 and then has been submitted to an additional T 8 post-welding heat treat-ment. Actually a typical friction stir weld consists of the unaffected base material (BM), a heat affected zone (HAZ), a thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) and a dynamically recrystallized zone (nugget). Some samples were removed from the BM and the nugget of the welded joint in or-der to study the corrosion and stress corrosion cracking behaviour of these two zones individually. Immersion tests with and without an external mechanical stress were performed in a 0. 7 M NaCl solution to study the corrosion behaviour of the two zones and the influence of the stress. For both kinds of experiments, the corrosion damage was determined by measuring the average depth and the maximal depth of the corrosion defects. The results showed that the two zones presented different corrosion morphologies. The BM exhibited susceptibility to <b>intragranular</b> <b>corrosion</b> while the nugget presented both intragranular and intergranular corrosion. The external mechanical stress did not modify the corrosion morphologies and the open circuit potential. Nevertheless, as they present different corrosion morphologies, the external mechanical stress did not have the same influence on the propagation of the corrosion damage. Indeed, the external mechanical stress did not promote the propagation of the corrosion in the BM whereas it does in the Nugget. Considering the whole welded joint, the corrosion morphologies of the BM and the nugget were the same than those observed for each zone considered individually. A previous work [1] has shown that galvanic coupling phenomena existed between the different parts of the welded joint and the BM acted as a sacrificial anode. As the external stress did not change the OCP of the different parts, no modification of the galvanic coupling phenomena was expected and the BM was found to be more damaged than the other zones. ...|$|E
