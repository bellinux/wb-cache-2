5|$|Nothing {{is known}} about {{behavior}} or diet. P.simplex has frequently been found in pellets of the barn owl (Tyto alba) and also in those of the <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owl</b> (Bubo virginianus). It is a preferred prey of the maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus).|$|E
5|$|Besides its prairie restorations {{and bodies}} of water, Silver Springs has areas of {{deciduous}} forests, and wetlands, {{both of which}} are populated with species of mammals, birds and insects. Bird life observed in the park includes: osprey, <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owl,</b> eastern screech owl and long-eared owl; bald eagle have been sighted further upstream along the Fox. Reptiles and amphibians are present in the park but are more elusive than other types of animal life.|$|E
5|$|Adult mockingbirds {{can fall}} victim to birds of prey such as the <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owl,</b> screech owl and sharp-shinned hawk, though their {{tenacious}} behavior makes them less likely to being captured. Scrub-jays also have killed and eaten mockingbirds. Snakes rarely capture incubating females. Fledgelings have been prey to domestic cats, red-tailed hawks, and crows. Eggs and nestlings are consumed by blue jays, fish crows and American crows, red-tailed hawks, swallow-tailed kites, snakes, squirrels, and cats. Blowfly larvae and Haemoproteus {{have been found in}} Florida and Arizona populations, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Pettigrew State Park is home {{to several}} species of birds of prey. Ospreys build their nests in {{the tops of the}} tallest trees in the park and feed on the {{abundant}} fish of Lake Phelps. The population of bald eagles is increasing and they are occasionally seen over the park. At least three species of owl, the <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owl,</b> barred owl and eastern screech owl, make their home in the forests of the park, as do red tailed and red shouldered hawks. American kestrel and northern harriers also find suitable habitats at Pettigrew State Park.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 260 {{species of birds}} have been recorded, with raptors such as the bald eagle, golden eagle, {{peregrine}} falcon, osprey and several species of hawks residing year round. The harlequin duck is a colorful species of waterfowl found in the lakes and waterways. The great blue heron, tundra swan, Canada goose and American wigeon are species of waterfowl more commonly encountered in the park. <b>Great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owl,</b> Clark's nutcracker, Steller's jay, pileated woodpecker and cedar waxwing reside in the dense forests along the mountainsides, and in the higher altitudes, the ptarmigan, timberline sparrow and rosy finch {{are the most likely}} to be seen. The Clark's nutcracker is less plentiful than in past years due to the {{decline in the number of}} whitebark pines.|$|E
5|$|Several {{minerals}} {{used for}} paint pigments were excavated from Chetro Ketl, including charcoal, shale, malachite, iron oxides, hematite, limonite, gypsum, and azurite. Twined sandals, and bones from the ferruginous hawk and the <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owl</b> {{have been found}} there. The relative lack of exotic material uncovered at Chetro Ketl, such as shells, copper bells, and macaw feathers, may indicate its lesser importance compared to Pueblo Bonito, where those items {{have been found in}} abundance. Because Chetro Ketl has only been partially excavated definitive conclusions remain elusive. In 1937, W. W. Postlethwaite, who had for three seasons directed Hewett's excavation of Chetro Ketl's great kiva, oversaw the final work at the site conducted by the University of New Mexico and the School of American Research.|$|E

5|$|There {{is little}} {{data on the}} {{longevity}} and mortality of the camas pocket gopher. It is presumably prey for carnivorous mammals, and its bones {{have been identified in}} regurgitated pellets of raptors such as the <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owl.</b> Parasites include mites, lice, fleas, roundworms and flatworms. The species' tougher skin may protect it from some fleas known to infest Botta's pocket gopher and the Mazama pocket gopher. Mites known to parasitize the camas pocket gopher include Androlaelaps geomys and Echinonyssus femuralis. Some authorities report Androlaelaps fahrenholzi as another parasitic mite, but a later publication did not report it. The chewing louse Geomydoecus oregonus has also been reported.|$|E
5|$|Nearby {{tracts of}} habitat {{strongly}} affect the wildlife in the Balch Creek watershed. This {{is especially true}} of Forest Park, which extends into other watersheds to the northwest. Birds and animals from these watersheds and from the Tualatin River valley, the Coast Range, the Willamette River, Sauvie Island, the Columbia River, and the Vancouver, Washington, lowlands, move {{in and out of the}} park with relative ease. Sixty-two mammal species, including the northern flying squirrel, black-tailed deer, creeping vole, bobcat, coyote, Mazama pocket gopher, little brown bat, Roosevelt elk, and Pacific jumping mouse use Forest Park. blue grouse, <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owl,</b> hairy woodpecker, Bewick's wren, orange-crowned warbler, osprey, and hermit thrush are among the 112species of birds that frequent the area. Amphibian species seen at the Audubon Society pond include rough-skinned newts, Pacific tree frogs, and salamanders.|$|E
5|$|The pair {{defends the}} chosen nest site against other peregrines, and often against ravens, herons, and gulls, and if ground-nesting, also such mammals as foxes, wolverines, felids, bears, wolves, and {{mountain}} lions. Both nests and (less frequently) adults are predated by larger-bodied raptorial birds like eagles, large owls, or gyrfalcons. The most serious predators of peregrine nests in North America and Europe are the <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owl</b> and the Eurasian eagle owl. When reintroductions have been attempted for peregrines, {{the most serious}} impediments were these two owls routinely picking off nestlings, fledglings and adults by night. Peregrines defending their nests have managed to kill raptors as large as golden eagles and bald eagles (both of which they normally avoid as potential predators) that have come {{too close to the}} nest by ambushing them in a full stoop. In one instance, when a snowy owl killed a newly fledged peregrine, the larger owl was in turn killed by a stooping peregrine parent.|$|E
25|$|Predators of black-footed ferrets include golden eagles, <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owls,</b> coyotes, American badgers, bobcats, prairie falcons, {{ferruginous}} hawks, and prairie rattlesnakes.|$|R
50|$|Predators include barn <b>owls,</b> <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owls,</b> long-eared owls, and short-eared owls. Prairie falcons {{are also}} {{reported}} as predators.

5|$|Over 300 {{species of}} birds have been sighted in the park {{including}} the calliope hummingbird, the smallest bird species in North America, as well as trumpeter swans, which is North America's largest waterfowl. In addition to trumpeter swans, another 30 species of waterfowl have been recorded including blue-winged teal, common merganser, American wigeon and the colorful but reclusive harlequin duck which is occasionally spotted in Cascade Canyon. Both bald and golden eagles and other birds of prey such as the osprey, red-tailed hawk, American kestrel and occasional sightings of peregrine falcon have been reported. Of the 14 species of owls reported, the most common is the <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owl,</b> though the boreal owl and great grey owl are also seen occasionally. A dozen species of woodpeckers have been reported, as have a similar number of species of warblers, plovers and gulls. The vocal and gregarious black-billed magpie frequents campgrounds while Steller's jay and Clark's nutcracker {{are found in the}} backcountry. The sage covered plains of Jackson Hole are favored areas for sage grouse, Brewer's sparrow and sage thrashers, while the wetlands are frequented by great blue heron, American white pelican, sandhill crane and on rare occasions it's endangered relative, the whooping crane.|$|E
25|$|Birds that inhabit {{this park}} include the red-tailed hawk, broad-winged hawk, rough-legged hawk, swainson's hawk, Peregrine falcon, osprey, <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owl,</b> barred owl, screech owl, turkey vulture and raven.|$|E
25|$|Owls are not {{closely related}} to hawks or falcons. There is little written in classic {{falconry}} that discusses the use of owls in falconry. However, {{there are at least}} two species that have successfully been used, the Eurasian eagle owl and the <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owl.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owls</b> {{compete with}} the red-tailed hawk for nest sites. Each species {{has been known to}} kill the young and destroy the eggs of the other, but in general, both species nest in {{adjacent}} or confluent territories without conflict. <b>Great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owls</b> are incapable of constructing nests and typically expropriate existing red-tail nests. <b>Great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owls</b> begin nesting behaviors much earlier than red-tails, often as early as December. Red-tails are therefore adapted to constructing new nests when a previous year's nest has been overtaken by owls or otherwise lost. New nests are typically within a kilometer or less of the previous nest. Often, a new nest is only a few hundred meters or less from a previous one. Being a large predator, most predation of these hawks occurs with eggs and nestlings, which are taken by owls, corvids and raccoons.|$|R
50|$|Northern {{spotted owl}} (Strix occidentalis caurina) is an old-growth {{dependent}} species and {{is listed as}} threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The majority of spotted owls on the Olympic peninsula, along with the largest preserve of temperate old-growth forest, live in the national park. Spotted owls prey on flying squirrels and snowshoe hares, and are themselves preyed on by <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owls</b> Bubo virginianus. The density of the canopy of an old-growth forest gives the spotted owls some protection from the larger, less agile <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owls.</b>|$|R
50|$|Various {{birds and}} mammals, {{such as the}} fisher (Martes pennanti), are among the predators of eggs and young spotted owls. Northern {{goshawks}} (Accipiter gentilis) and crows may prey on juvenile spotted <b>owls,</b> while <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owls</b> (Bubo virginianus), red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), and golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) are likely predators of both juveniles and adults. <b>Great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owls</b> and barred owls may compete with spotted owls for food and space in some areas. Barred owls may {{have a negative effect}} on northern spotted owl survival and fecundity in some areas.|$|R
25|$|Resident {{bird species}} include Indian robin and magpie robin, common {{kingfisher}}, pied kingfisher and white-breasted kingfisher, <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owl,</b> common iora, purple-rumped sunbird, purple sunbird and Loten's sunbird, spotted dove and laughing dove, Indian nightjar, Eurasian stone-curlew (thick-knee), ashy woodswallow, common woodshrike, blue-faced malkoha, common babbler, red-whiskered bulbul, red-vented bulbul and white-browed bulbul, Oriental honey buzzard, white-eyed buzzard and shikra.|$|E
25|$|Owls, {{which may}} have {{dissimilar}} periods of activity, are not entirely exempt from golden eagle predation either. Several species have been recorded as prey, especially in Northern Europe, Slovakia (where owls make up 2.4% of prey remains) and {{some parts of the}} Western United States. Species hunted have ranged in size from tiny Eurasian pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum) and little owl (Athene noctua) to the formidable, large great horned, Eurasian eagle and great gray owls (Strix nebulosa). Barn owls (Tyto alba) have been predated by golden eagles in both North America and Eurasia. On Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands, barn owls made up 4.5% of the diet, the largest known occurrence of that species in the eagles' diet. However, the <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owl</b> is the owl species that occurs most regularly in the diet of North American golden eagles. In Europe, golden eagles are relatively minor predators of owls compared to Eurasian eagle-owls and northern goshawks. The primary owls hunted by European eagles are Ural owls (Strix uralensis) and short-eared owls (Asio flammeus). Few eye-witness accounts are known of owl predation, but one violent mid-day confrontation between a golden eagle and an adult <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owl</b> was witnessed in Jefferson County, Colorado. Although this owl was {{about a third of the}} eagle's weight, it was able to land some damaging blows on the larger bird. In the end, despite its wounds, the eagle was victorious over the dead owl. A case of kleptoparasitism by a golden eagle on a <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owl</b> has been recorded.|$|E
25|$|Nanmangalam Reserve Forest is a {{scrub forest}} {{covering}} {{an area of}} 320 hectares. It {{is the only place}} in the city where the <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owl</b> (Eurasian eagle-owl) is resident. It has been successfully breeding there for two decades. Over 80 species of resident and migratory birds have been recorded so far. Nanmangalam Reserve Forest is a very good place for reptiles and insects too.|$|E
25|$|Pinyon jays {{have been}} seen mobbing <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owls</b> (Bubo virginianus), sharp-shinned hawks (Accipiter striatus), Cooper's hawks (A. cooperii), red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), and common gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus).|$|R
50|$|The area is {{inhabited}} by several indigenous mammals and birds. These include bighorn sheep, gila monsters, kit foxes, desert tortoises, golden eagles, prairie falcons, barn <b>owls</b> and <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owls.</b>|$|R
50|$|Typically, <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owls</b> {{are highly}} sedentary, often capable of {{utilizing}} a single territory throughout their mature lives. Although some {{species such as}} snowy owls, northern saw-whet owls, long-eared and short-eared owls are true migrants, most North American owls are not migratory and will generally show fidelity to a single territory year around. In <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owls,</b> mated pairs occupy territories year-round and long-term. Territories are established and maintained through hooting, with highest activity before egg-laying and second peak in autumn when juveniles disperse, and can range {{from an average of}} 16 km2 in Yukon to an average of 2.1 km2 in Wyoming.|$|R
25|$|It {{is found}} in {{association}} with other rodents such as Abrothrix olivaceus, Abrothrix longipilis, Oligoryzomys longicaudatus, Geoxus valdivianus, and Auliscomys pictus, {{as well as the}} marsupials Rhyncholestes raphanurus and Dromiciops gliroides. Remains of Irenomys have been found in owl pellets of the <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owl</b> (Bubo virginianus), rufous-legged owl (Strix rufipes), and barn owl (Tyto alba); other potential predators include another owl, the Austral pygmy-owl (Glaucidium nanum), and the South American gray fox (Pseudalopex griseus), Darwin's fox (Pseudalopex fulvipes) and Kodkod (Leopardus guigna).|$|E

25|$|The Salmon Falls Creek {{watershed}} {{varies widely}} {{in terms of}} different habitats. Along the lower section of the creek, plentiful water flow and numerous springs create a rich riparian environment compared to an oasis, lined with coyote willow, dogwood, golden currant, cattail, mint and poison ivy. The upper section is a slow-moving waterway that supports a small wetland and extensive meadows. In contrast, {{the vast majority of}} the upper undeveloped watershed is a shrub-steppe sagebrush grassland, much of which is used for grazing. Many bird species use the Salmon Falls Creek canyon, including white-throated swift, canyon and rock wrens, cliff swallow, violet-green swallow, barn swallow, screech owl, long-eared owl, <b>great</b> <b>horned</b> <b>owl,</b> kestrel, red-tailed hawk, golden eagles and prairie falcon. Mule deer also inhabit areas of the middle and upper Salmon Falls Creek basin.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the large}} numbers birds found in the Summer Lake basin, birds of prey are common.
