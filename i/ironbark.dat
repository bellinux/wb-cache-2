25|$|Monofloral honey is made {{primarily}} from the nectar of one type of flower. Different monofloral honeys have a distinctive flavor and color because of differences between their principal nectar sources. To produce monofloral honey, beekeepers keep beehives {{in an area where}} the bees have access to only one type of flower. In practice, because of the difficulties in containing bees, a small proportion of any honey will be from additional nectar from other flower types. Typical examples of North American monofloral honeys are clover, orange blossom, blueberry, sage, tupelo, buckwheat, fireweed, mesquite, and sourwood. Some typical European examples include thyme, thistle, heather, acacia, dandelion, sunflower, lavender, honeysuckle, and varieties from lime and chestnut trees. In North Africa (e.g. Egypt), examples include clover, cotton, and citrus (mainly orange blossoms). The unique flora of Australia yields a number of distinctive honeys, {{with some of the most}} popular being yellow box, blue gum, <b>ironbark,</b> bush mallee, Tasmanian leatherwood, and macadamia.|$|E

The explorer Dr John Lhotsky claimed that his journey in 1834 south from the Limestone Plains toward Michelago represented a descent into what he considered barbarism: no church south of Sutton Forest, no window pane south of Canberra, no white woman south of Michelago. The first Monaro Superintendent of Police, the Corsican Francis Nicholas Rossi, built an <b>ironbark</b> slab homestead in the region called Micilago on 35,000 acres (14,175 hectares) in 1837; this station was bought in 1859 by Alexander Ryrie who married Charlotte Faunce the daughter of Alured Tasker Faunce the police magistrate at Queanbeyan; one of their children being Granville Ryrie, later a General in World War I, knighted and involved with the League of Nations in Geneva.

500|$|Across its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater {{is found}} {{in a range of}} habitats—in open sclerophyll forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in {{riparian}} woodlands. [...] It most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum (Corymbia maculata) with ironbarks and stringybarks such as narrow-leaved <b>ironbark</b> (Eucalyptus crebra) and silver-leaved <b>ironbark</b> (E. melanophloia), with a light shrubby understorey, and less often in dry open forests and woodlands dominated by Angophora, Acacia, Banksia, Casuarina or Callitris, or in high-altitude, tall, open forests of alpine ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis) and woodlands dominated by snow gum (E. pauciflora) or white box (E. albens). It has been recorded in coastal heath when banksias are blooming, and among flowering mangroves. It occupies areas infested with weeds such as Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius) and blackberries, and developed areas including orchards and parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers.

40|$|Increased {{abundance}} of noisy miners (Manorina melanocephala), a large, aggressive honeyeater, {{is one of}} the most important mechanisms through which habitat fragmentation and degradation threaten populations of eastern Australian woodland birds. In inland Queensland, however, noisy miners dominate avian assemblages throughout extensive forest areas as well as fragmented landscapes, and our understanding of the factors influencing their behaviour and habitat selection in such relatively intact landscapes is limited. I investigated how road edges influenced noisy miners by comparing the species’ aggressive and foraging behaviour, and location of nests, between road-edge and interior transects in a southern Queensland forest. I also investigated noisy miner foraging microhabitat preferences and targets of aggression. Noisy Miner nests were more likely to be located near to road edges, but foraging and aggressive interactions occurred with similar frequency near and far from road edges. Such interactions selectively targeted close competitors and a nest predator. Most foraging activity was in the canopy, and selectively within <b>ironbarks</b> (Eucalyptus spp.), suggesting that higher densities of noisy miners in more open areas of the forest are unlikely to be related to facilitation of ground-foraging activity. Despite some evidence of a preference for nesting near road openings, road edges do not appear to influence noisy miners as strongly as edges between forest and agricultural land do elsewhere in eastern Australia...|$|R

40|$|The {{semi-arid}} rangelands {{of tropical}} North Queensland {{have suffered a}} major decline in land condition since arrival of Europeans. This includes erosion and soil loss, the widespread loss of native perennial tussock grasses and the widespread invasion of exotic plant species; some accidental, others introduced to help stem the process of land degradation. It has often been stated or implied that cattle grazing {{is an important factor}} in the land degradation process; a suggestion supported by various research projects. The present research examined impacts of grazing on various characteristics of plant communities in the semi-arid rangelands of tropical north Queensland. Characteristics examined included diversity, functional groups, ground cover and tree dieback. The diversity and composition of a pasture is usually determined by abiotic effects such as soil and climate, and secondarily by the nature of grazing. However, the present study demonstrated that, in some cases, grazing played an equally important role in determining species assemblages. Grazing generally resulted in a decline in the abundance of: •native perennial tussock grasses •exotic pasture legumes, and •palatable species. Grazing caused an increase in: •exotic grasses •forbs •native legumes, and •unpalatable species. Impacts of grazing on diversity were dependant on the dominant grass species and its palatability. When native palatable and perennial grasses such as kangaroo grass (Themeda triandra) and black spear grass (Heteropogon contortus) dominated, intermediate levels of grazing resulted in an increase in diversity since the grazing released other plant species from competition. Where the dominant grass was a less palatable exotic grass species such as Indian couch (Bothriochloa pertusa) or buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris), grazing reduced diversity since grazing reinforced the dominance of those grass species. Cenchrus ciliaris itself was identified as having a deleterious effect on species diversity, independent of grazing pressure. The responses of functional groups such as annual grasses were dependant on levels of palatability, which may have varied from site to site. The effects of cattle grazing on many functional groups were less pronounced in areas grazed only during the dry season, in contrast to areas grazed continuously throughout the year. Grazing had a deleterious influence on ground cover. While intermediate grazing caused a level of decline in ground cover that was beneficial to many species, heavy grazing may result in scalding and erosion. An exception to this is where grazing reinforced the dominance of Bothriochloa pertusa; the spreading stoloniferous habit of which can result in increased ground cover. During this research, widespread dieback of <b>ironbarks</b> (Eucalyptus crebra sensu lat.) was observed throughout the semi- arid rangelands on a range of soil types and grazing regimes. In contrast to previous research, the present study found a correlation between cattle grazing and the dieback of Eucalyptus crebra, although dieback occurred to some degree even in the absence of grazing. Large trees were more susceptible to dieback than small saplings, which, in some cases, may have benefited from grazing by the removal of competing herbaceous species from their proximity. The present research showed that with prolonged heavy grazing, transitions in states of land condition might occur which would be irreversible without major inputs. It was recommended that achieving sustainability of the grazing industry in both economic and conservation terms would involve the regular monitoring of several land condition parameters. This would identify economically feasible opportunities for pasture rehabilitation from opportunistic de-stocking or changing the seasons of cattle grazing. The present study noted that diversity and land condition were optimal under a regime of intermediate disturbance, and that this level of disturbance occurred with macropod grazing. Likewise, the provision of cattle exclosures adjacent to pastures allowed a source of seed for recolonisation of native perennial tussock grasses where those species had been otherwise eliminated by the excessive overuse of grazing. Limitations in this study were discussed and recommendations for future research priorities were made...|$|R
