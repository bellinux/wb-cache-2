500|$|Macnaghten's fourth {{category}} contains {{not only}} individual categories of its own, but also general principles that are applied when a body seeks to be recognised as a charitable trust. The {{first of these}} [...] "sub-categories" [...] contains trusts {{for the benefit of}} the sick and old; the Preamble to the 1601 Act gave [...] "aged, impotent and poor people" [...] as acceptable beneficiaries for a charity. These acceptable beneficiaries are to be read individually; there is no requirement to aid the aged and impotent as well as the poor, and one can even exclude the poor, such as in Re Resch's Will Trusts, which dealt with a hospital that charged fees. The second sub-category is for charitable trusts relating to animals. As with religious charities, the benefit is derived not <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>comfort</b> afforded to the animals, but from the [...] "indirect moral benefit to mankind". Again, this excludes trusts which isolate the beneficiaries from the public, as in Re Grove-Grady, where the trust sought to provide [...] "a refuge ... so that they shall be safe from molestation and destruction by man". Charities for the purpose of creating animal sanctuaries usually pass the public benefit test despite this, because they do not completely exclude the public and often have educational value.|$|E
