40|$|Capture {{fisheries}} and aquaculture supplied {{the world with}} about 148 million tonnes of fish in 2010, of which about 128 million tonnes were utilized as food for people. The fishery market is becoming much more complex and stratified, with greater diversification among species and product forms {{and for this reason}} food safety remains a major concern facing the seafood industry. Along fish value chain {{there are a lot of}} concern regarding public health and for this reason the aim of this work was to propose an approach to antibiotic resistance and parasites risk assessment in fish production value chains. The main consequences of the use and the abuse of antibiotics is the development and diffusion of antibiotic resistance that become a serious global problem. The aim of this research was to evaluate the presence of antimicrobial residues and to assess the antimicrobial resistance in bacteria species isolated from different wild caught seawater fish and fishery products. Three antibiotic substances (Oxytetracicline, Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim) were detected (by screening and confirmatory methods) in Octopus vulgaris, Sepia officinalis and Thais haemastoma. All Vibrio strains isolated from fish were resistant to Vancomycin and Penicillin. In Vibrio alginolyticus, isolated in Octopus vulgaris, a resistance against 9 antibiotics was noted. Human fishery product-borne parasitic diseases include those caused by cestodes, trematodes and nematodes. These diseases are either caused by an infection following ingestion of viable parasites, or as an allergic (hypersensitivity) reaction against parasite antigens which occurs for nematodes of the family Anisakidae. Parasite risk assessment was evaluated in 3 different steps: •	Different infection indexes in <b>european</b> <b>hakes</b> (Merluccius merluccius) belonging from Atlantic ocean (FAO zone 27 IXa) and from Tyrrhenian sea (FAO zone 37. 1. 2) were assessed identifying and charactering species and populations of parasites. A total of 2990 larval specimens of A. simplex (s. l.) from Merluccius merluccius captured in the two different fishing grounds were collected: 2836 anisakids in hakes from FAO 27 fishing ground and only 154 anisakids in hakes from 37. 1. 2 fishing ground. A. simplex (s. s.) and A. pegreffii co-infected the same individual fish host, in viscera and in the fillets (hypaxial and epaxial) fished from the FAO 27 fishing ground; only A. pegreffii in hakes from FAO area 37. 1. 2 in viscera and in hypaxial flesh was found. •	The presence of nematodes in 33 fish species belonging from different FAO areas using artificial peptic digestion was evaluated and parasites identification using microscopical techniques and RT-PCR was performed. A total of 10897 anisakid larvae were found and collected in the flesh. The blue ling (Molva dypterygia), european conger (Conger conger) and Peter's fish (Zeus faber) were the most highly infected species respectively. A total of 27, 27 % of the species analyzed were anisakid-free; a monitoring tool for the evaluation of parasite infection in fish lots with the aim to assess parasites impact on marketed fish, as EFSA states in a recent report, was applied; 29 % of the evaluated fish lots had a score between 0 - 3, refering to serious weaknesses in the fish lots. •	The survival of Anisakis larvae, naturally present in fish, at different stages of ripening process in traditional salted anchovies was evaluated since a recent EFSA panel on risk assessment of parasites in fishery products stated that research on identification of alternative treatments for killing viable parasites in fishery products are needed. Viability was tested with different methods and the results showed that all larvae were not viable at the 15 th ripening day. The dry salting process at mean salt concentration of 24 % in all parts of the flesh at the end of the ripening period can be considered an effective method for devitalising anisakids larval forms present in the raw material and obtain a safe product for the consumer...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} of maturity and sex of fish stocks in European waters {{is a requirement}} of the EU Data Collection Framework {{as part of the}} policy to improve fisheries management. On the other hand, research on fish biology is increasingly focused in molecular approaches, researchers needing correct identification of fish sex and reproductive stage without necessarily having in house the histological know-how necessary for the task. Taking advantage of the differential gene transcription occurring during fish sex differentiation and gametogenesis, the utility of 5 S ribosomal RNA (5 S rRNA) and General transcription factor IIIA (gtf 3 a) in the molecular identification of sex and gametogenic stage was tested in different economically-relevant fish species from the Bay of Biscay. Gonads of 9 fish species (, Atlantic, Atlantic-chub and horse mackerel, blue whiting, bogue, <b>European</b> anchovy, <b>hake</b> and pilchard and megrim), collected from local commercial fishing vessels were histologically sexed and 5 S and 18 S rRNA concentrations were quantified by capillary electrophoresis to calculate a 5 S/ 18 S rRNA index. Degenerate primers permitted cloning and sequencing of gtf 3 a fragments in 7 of the studied species. 5 S rRNA and gtf 3 a transcript levels, together with 5 S/ 18 S rRNA index, distinguished clearly ovaries from testis in all of the studied species. The values were always higher in females than in males. 5 S/ 18 S rRNA index values in females were always highest when fish were captured in early phases of ovary development whilst, in later vitellogenic stages, the values decreased significantly. In megrim and European anchovy, where gonads in different oogenesis stages were obtained, the 5 S/ 18 S rRNA index identified clearly gametogenic stage. This approach, to the sexing and the quantitative non-subjective identification of the maturity stage of female fish, could have multiple applications in the study of fish stock dynamics, fish reproduction and fecundity and fish biology in general...|$|R

The square-mesh codend allowed a reduction of about 37 % of the fraction discarded at sea. The mean catch obtained with the experimental codend was lower than that obtained with the traditional codend (about 14 kg per haul) but the short-term economic losses were low (~ 12 %). The square-mesh codend was also more selective than the traditional codend, giving the juveniles of <b>European</b> <b>hake</b> a good chance of escape: the mean selection length (L 50) was 7. 60 cm in DM and 12. 98 cm in SM.

We applied the ALADYM (age-length based dynamic model) simulation model to three different studies aimed at investigating correlations between pressure and population metrics, exploring the viability of different mortality levels in long-term scenarios and predicting the effects of combined management measures. Uncertainty was incorporated into the simulations following the Monte Carlo paradigm. Three stocks were used for these exercises: red mullet in the central-southern Tyrrhenian Sea and <b>European</b> <b>hake</b> in both the Bay of Biscay and the Aegean Sea. The analysis {{of the relationships between}} total mortality and indicators highlighted significant pairwise negative correlations for red mullet. These signals of decline were supported by the spawning potential ratio indicator (mean exploited to mean unexploited spawning-stock biomass ESSB/USSB), which was low compared to target levels.

40|$|The {{change of}} mesh size or shape as a {{management}} measure to improve selectivity {{as proposed by}} the EU should be assessed using actual fishery data, despite being tested experimentally in previous studies. This work was conducted to evaluate the consequences of inserting either a 40 -mm square-mesh or a 50 -mm diamond-mesh (instead of the traditional 40 -mm diamond-mesh) at codends in commercial Spanish trawlers. Landings in terms of biomass, income and catch composition were compared under commercial conditions. Four métiers were identified in the fishery: <b>European</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius merluccius), red mullet (Mullus barbatus), red shrimp (Aristeus antennatus) and Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). No significant differences were observed in biomass or income owing to the new mesh in either <b>European</b> <b>hake</b> or red mullet. In contrast, the total biomass of the red shrimp métier and the biomass of the Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, were significantly higher after the selectivity change. Regarding the catch composition, only the <b>European</b> <b>hake</b> métier showed slight - but not significant - changes after using the new mesh. Considering these results, there was no short-term effect (substantial biological or economic loss) as previous studies had expected.

40|$|Recently it {{was stated}} a strong {{dependence}} of <b>European</b> <b>hake</b> abundance with climate variability in NW Africa. This relationship was {{explained by the}} North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) driving the upwelling temporality and its geographic coverage, which could be responsible of changes in survival rate during early life stages of this species. Following this hypothesis, this work focuses on {{the relative importance of}} climate variability on recruitment dynamics of <b>European</b> <b>hake.</b> Interannual variability of recruitment success were analyzed through two types of time series: (i) from monthly and annual length distribution fishery data (1982 - 1999) of Spanish trawling fleet that worked under Spanish or European-Moroccan fishery agreements and (ii) recruits annual abundance from scientific Moroccan surveys (1982 - 2004). The time series were compared with the annual smoothed NAO index to evaluate the type of relationship, persistence and their relative contribution as a variation source of recruitment success. The recruitment to the fishery took place during all year with peaks in spring and summer, but the seasonal component was weak. The time series were in synchrony with NAO index of the previous year and showed strong positive correlation. The variation of recruitment success explained by NAO was 25 to 82 % depending on time series size. The main NAO effect in recruitment dynamics was the widening-contraction of Recruitment Window. During NAO+ phase several success cohorts were recruited by year, while in NAO- the success cohorts were scarce and weak.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of northern <b>European</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius merluccius L.) {{extends from the}} Bay of Biscay up to Norwegian waters. However, despite its wide geographical distribution, {{there have been few}} studies on fluctuations in the <b>European</b> <b>hake</b> populations. Marine ecosystem shifts have been investigated worldwide and their influence on trophic levels has been studied, from top predator fish populations down to planktonic prey species, but there is little information on the effect of atmosphere-ocean shifts on <b>European</b> <b>hake.</b> This work analyses hake recruitment success (recruits per adult biomass) in relation to environmental changes over the period 1978 - 2006 in order to determine whether the regime shift identified in several abiotic and biotic variables in the North Sea also affected the Northeast Atlantic shelf oceanography. Hake recruitment success as well as parameters such as the sea surface temperature, wind patterns and copepod abundance changed significantly {{at the end of the}} 1980 s, demonstrating an ecological regime shift in the Northeast Atlantic. Despite the low reproductive biomass recorded during the last decades, hake recruitment success has been higher since the change in 1989 / 90. The higher productivity may have sustained the population despite the intense fishing pressure; copepod abundance, warmer water temperatures and moderate eastward transport were found to be beneficial. In conclusion, in 1988 / 89 the Northeast Atlantic environment shifted to a favourable regime for northern hake production. This study supports the hypothesis that the hydro-climatic regime shift that affected the North Sea in the late 1980 s may have influenced a wider region, such as the Northeast Atlantic. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|E

40|$|<b>European</b> <b>hake</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} economic resources for South European fleets; however, not many studies on its reproductive biology have been carried out. Gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indices and condition factor were estimated. Proximate composition was analyzed in gonad, liver and muscle as indicators of female condition status; these results were converted to energy values. Variations of these parameters during the spawning season and through the year were studied. The hake population in Galician waters has a protracted spawning season with peak spawning from February to March. The proximate composition of tissues changes considerably throughout the spawning season although population spawning asynchrony masks temporal patterns. This work corroborates that energy dynamics associated with egg production in <b>European</b> <b>hake</b> are different from those observed in species from temperate waters (5 °– 10 °C), depending more on environmental conditions and food availability during the spawning season than on body energy reserves.
