40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence <b>of</b> <b>buttermilk</b> on the physicochemical and sensory attributes of pan and pita breads. Different amounts <b>of</b> <b>buttermilk</b> (30, 60, and 100 % of added water) were mixed with other ingredients of pan and pita bread formulations. The doughs and bread were analyzed for rheological, physicochemical, and sensory qualities. The results demonstrated that incorporation of different concentrations <b>of</b> <b>buttermilk</b> in bread formulations progressively enhanced water absorption capacity, dough development time, gelatinization temperature, and peak viscosity, whereas it reduced the dough stability and temperature at peak viscosity. Supplementation of wheat flour with 30 % buttermilk significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) enhanced the physical properties of pan bread compared to nonsupplemented control. Incorporation of different percentages <b>of</b> <b>buttermilk</b> in bread formulation concomitantly (P ≤ 0. 05) increased protein, oil, and ash contents and it reduced the carbohydrate contents of both types of bread. Incorporation of 60 and 100 % <b>of</b> <b>buttermilk</b> in bread formula showed low scores of all sensory attributes compared to control and 30 % buttermilk containing pan and pita bread. In conclusion, supplementation of bread formulas with 30 % buttermilk is recommended for improving the nutritional and sensorial qualities of pan and pita bread...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{a ceramic}} {{microfiltration}} (MF) membrane for the fractionation <b>of</b> <b>buttermilk</b> and whey buttermilk obtained from pilot scale churning of cream and whey cream from industrial sources has been studied. Whey buttermilk contained comparable amounts of phospholipids compared to regular buttermilk but its protein content was lower due {{to the absence of}} caseins. However, it was found that lipid content of whey cream did vary significantly between lots resulting in important variations in the fat content <b>of</b> whey <b>buttermilk.</b> A twofold MF concentration <b>of</b> regular <b>buttermilk</b> doubled its phospholipids content whereas that <b>of</b> whey <b>buttermilk</b> was increased by 50 %. The overall efficiency of the MF processing <b>of</b> regular <b>buttermilk</b> was limited by the amount of caseins retained by the MF membrane. Analysis of the protein profile of permeates and retentates showed that the transmission of milk fat globule membrane proteins by the MF membrane was lower when using whey buttermilk as compared to regular buttermilk possibly indicating the influence of casein micelles in fractionation or some structural differences between both products...|$|R

Aim: To foresee {{practice}} possibilities <b>of</b> <b>buttermilk</b> in the {{processed food}} fabrication, estimate its biological value {{according to the}} analysis of literature.

Analyzing the survey results <b>of</b> <b>buttermilk</b> cheese it is very important to emphasize that it might be used as a remedial product because it contains much lecithin.

Buttermilk cheese differs from others for a high amount of protein - 35, 72 %. Generalizing it might be claimed that buttermilk is a very valuable product as it is being analyzed at present not all know its benefits for health; therefore many people refuse to buy it thinking that it is one of dairy products and it might be a wrong attitude for a secondary production which can not contain special features...|$|R
