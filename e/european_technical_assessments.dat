5000|$|To affix the [...] CE marking to a {{construction}} product, the manufacturer {{is obliged to}} draw up a Declaration of Performance (DoP) when {{a construction}} product is covered by a harmonized standard or conforms to a <b>European</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Assessment.</b> Any information about the product's performance in relation to the essential characteristics may be provided only {{in the form of a}} declaration of performance. The CE marking shall be applied to the product itself and where this should be not be possible to the packaging or accompanying documents.|$|R
50|$|The main {{objective}} of the CPR is the removal of technical barriers to trade in order to guarantee the free movement of construction products within the common internal market due to differing product and test standards, approval processes and conformity documents in the various member states. Key element to this, are the Harmonized Product Standard and the <b>European</b> <b>Technical</b> Approval. Harmonized standards are established by the European standardizations bodies CEN (European Committee for Standardization) and Cenelec (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization) with the involvement of stakeholders. Where a manufacturer would like to declare the characteristics for a construction product not yet covered by a harmonized product standard, he may use the procedure to establish a <b>European</b> <b>technical</b> <b>assessment.</b>|$|R
50|$|EOTA's {{primary purpose}} is the {{drafting}} of The <b>European</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Assessment</b> (ETA) which is a document providing information about {{the performance of a}} construction product, to be declared in relation to its essential characteristics. This definition is provided in the new Construction Products Regulation (EU/305/2011) entered into force on July 1, 2013, in all European Members States and in the European Economic Area., and are designed to reduce technical barriers in the construction products sector throughout Europe. Once a building product has an ETA certificate, it can display the CE mark and can be sold Europe wide.|$|R

50|$|<b>European</b> Organisation for <b>Technical</b> <b>Assessment</b> (EOTA) (Europäische Organisation für Technische Bewertung, Organisation européenne pour l'évaluation technique) is an {{international}} non-profit association. It was established in 1990 in Belgium under {{the provisions of the}} EC Council Directive of December 21, 1988, relating to construction products (Construction Products Directive 89/106/EEc). As from June 11, 2013, EOTA reregistered as the organisation for <b>technical</b> <b>assessment</b> according to Article 31 of the Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of March 9, 2011, laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products and repealing Council Directive 89/106/EEC (this Regulation being referred to hereafter as CPR).|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} research {{described in}} this dissertation {{is based on the}} author’s work over the years as head of the Eduardo Torroja Institute for Construction Science’s 4 Technical Unit for the Assessment of Innovative Construction Products. The hypothesis proposed is the feasibility of developing methodology able to deliver a preliminary estimate (in just 1 ‐ 3 months’ time) of the technical suitability of certain innovative construction products for their intended use. The product families studied are the object of <b>technical</b> <b>assessment</b> guides or guidelines authored by two European organisations, the Union Européenne pour l'agrément technique dans la construction (UEAtc) and the <b>European</b> Organization for <b>Technical</b> <b>Assessment</b> (EOTA). Such families are eligible for or have been awarded technical approvals (TAs, also referred to in English under the French term “agréments”) or <b>European</b> <b>Technical</b> Approvals (ETAs), which is presently an 11 ‐month process. The proposed methodology would consist of a pre‐assessment procedure referred to hereunder as DIT PREASSESSMENT/PREEVALUACIÓN (Spanish initials, PPD). Based on the experience obtained from trials, calculations and studies undertaken in the framework of this research, the proposed procedure would identify the performance factors (primarily identification and fitness for use, although also durability where ascertainable via shortterm testing) that predict construction product or system suitability in a more immediate time frame...|$|R

Since 1994, it has published the Construction Products Lists (Bauregellisten) on behalf of the Länder. In 1998, Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik granted the first <b>European</b> <b>technical</b> approval in Europe. In 2007, DIBt was recognised by the Land of Berlin and the Land of Brandenburg as Structural Safety Control Authority (Bautechnisches Prüfamt). In 2008, it took over the coordination of the market surveillance of CE marked products and since 2014, it has been the [...] "joint market surveillance authority of the Länder". In 2012, DIBt was designated as the sole <b>Technical</b> <b>Assessment</b> Body in Germany, as well as the notifying authority in accordance with the new Construction Products Regulation. Upon publication of the revised Energy Saving Ordinance (Energieeinsparverordnung) in November 2013, DIBt also became responsible for registering energy performance certificates and inspection reports for air-conditioning systems, as well as for carrying out electronic random checks.|$|R
