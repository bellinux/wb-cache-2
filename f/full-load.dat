5|$|The best-known {{hallmark}} of Vanaja, the <b>full-load</b> lifting tandem axle, {{was introduced in}} January 1957. This invention enabled an additional load of 2.5 tonnes to be carried and the entire load on the tandem could be moved to the fore axle using an electro-hydraulic system. The system improved the traction, offering a significant advantage on slippery surfaces. The innovative lifting tandem was developed under leadership of the company's chief engineer Veikko Muronen. Vanaja became the leader in the Finnish logging vehicle market and maintained this position until production ceased. In forestry work, a layout with a driven front axle and a tandem axle with a driven fore axle, called 4×4+2, became famous in Finland but is seldom seen outside the Nordic countries.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a {{tractable}} framework for SINR analysis in downlink heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs) with flexible cell association policies. The HCN is modeled as a multi-tier cellular network where each tier's base stations (BSs) are randomly located {{and have a}} particular transmit power, path loss exponent, spatial density, and bias towards admitting mobile users. For example, as compared to macrocells, picocells would usually have lower transmit power, higher path loss exponent (lower antennas), higher spatial density (many picocells per macrocell), and a positive bias so that macrocell users are actively encouraged to use the more lightly loaded picocells. In the present paper we implicitly assume all base stations have full queues; future work should relax this. For this model, we derive the outage probability of a typical user in the whole network or a certain tier, which is equivalently the downlink SINR cumulative distribution function. The results are accurate for all SINRs, and their expressions admit quite simple closed-forms in some plausible special cases. We also derive the average ergodic rate of the typical user, and the minimum average user throughput [...] the smallest value among the average user throughputs supported by one cell in each tier. We observe that neither the number of BSs or tiers changes the outage probability or average ergodic rate in an interference-limited <b>full-loaded</b> HCN with unbiased cell association (no biasing), and observe how biasing alters the various metrics.

50|$|The patent Stülcken derrick is {{used for}} very heavy cargo. It stems from the German {{shipyard}} HC Stülcken & Sohn which has been taken over later by neighboring yard Blohm & Voss. This derrick can handle up to 300 tonnes. The Stülcken can be made ready in few minutes, dramatically faster than a traditional heavy derrick, doesn't require lots of space and is operated by four winches. Between two v-shaped, unstayed Samson-posts is the Stülcken secured. This {{makes it possible to}} let the derrick swing through the posts to reach another hatch. For each post is a hoisting winch, a span winch and a lever that is run by one man only. Bearings, swivels, sheaves and the gooseneck can be unattended for up to four years and create only a friction of about 2%. The span tackles are independent and the halyard is endless. With the revolving suspension heads on the posts it takes ten minutes to swing all the way through. In the double-pendulum block type, half of the cargo tackle can be anchored {{to the base of the}} boom. In order to double the hook speed, the halyard passes through the purchases since one end is secured which reduces the SWL to its half. Typical dimensions of a 275 tonne Stülcken are: 25.5 m length, 0.97 m diameter, 1.5 m to 3.4 m diameter of posts, 18 m apart the posts (upper end) and 8.4 m apart the posts (lower end). The hook of a <b>full-loaded</b> 275 tonne Stülcken can move 2.3 m per minute. If only one purchase is secured and the derrick is loaded with 137 tonnes the hook gains velocity to 4.6 m per min. Even more speed can be gained when the winch ratios are reduced to 100 tonnes (triple speed) and 68 tonnes (quadruple speed). Detaching the union table the double-pendulum block type of Stülcken is able to swing through which allows the lower blocks to swing freely to each side of the boom. In this way the derrick reaches a vertical position. A bullrope easily pulls the derrick to the other side until the weight of the cargo tips the derrick over. The span tackles now have the weight on the other side. The union table is fixed again and the derrick can start its work on the other side. There are also Stülcken with single-pendulum blocks. At this type the cargo hook is detached and the lower and upper cargo block are hauled into the center of the Stülcken. To tip the derrick over the gravity is here used again. A derrick helps pump oil in most offshore rigs.|$|R
40|$|Induction motors are {{the most}} {{widespread}} rotating electric machines in industry due to their efficient and cost-effective performance. Induction motors are used to mainly operate at the constant speed since the rotor speed depends on the supply frequency. The development of power electronic devices and converter technologies has revolutionized the adjustable-speed induction motor drives. For most high-performance control methods, the effective motor control requires precise knowledge of the motor’s parameters, which are usually obtained from manufacturers. However, the manufacturers describe these parameters under starting or <b>full-loading</b> condition only, instead of the normal operating conditions. It {{is well known that}} motor parameters are influenced by not only the load level but also environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity and lubricant viscosity. The first part of the thesis describes the application of the sparse grid optimisation method in solving the induction motor parameter estimation problem. Kernel of the method is the efficient search in minimising the cost function on the grid created by using the Hyperbolic Cross Points (HCPs). The cost function quantifies the difference between simulation results and measurement results. Within model reference adaptive system (MRAS) framework, a global optimisation algorithm, HCP algorithm (HCPA), runs the motor model and finds the best parameters to minimise the value of the cost function. Since the proposed method requires only voltage and current signals, it is compatible with sensorless control methods, which have the benefits of increasing system reliability and reducing cost. The presented experimental validation shows that the relative errors of the estimated parameter values are less than 10 % under various load levels. The estimated parameters can be further refined by applying local search method using global search result as a start point. On the other hand, an induction motor failure results in severe damage not only to the motor itself but also to motor related equipment devices in an industrial plant. Consequently, motor condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are of great necessity to detect motor faults at the early stage in order to reduce unscheduled downtime, repair costs, and increase life span of machines. Emergence of a fault will cause a gradual drift of fault-related characteristic model parameters. Therefore, a generic method to detect motor faults developed in this research is based on monitoring these parameters. In the second part of this thesis, the proposed parameter estimation technique based on the sparse grid optimisation is utilised to detect stator short circuit faults by monitoring two characteristic parameters: fault level and fault location. Experimental results show that the proposed diagnosis method is capable of detecting stator short circuit fault levels and location under different load conditions. Compared to the genetic algorithm, the HCPA shows improved robustness in the case of unbalanced voltage supply. This non-invasive diagnosis method only needs a short length of voltage and current signals recorded at switch board without disrupting the machine’s normal operation. The third part of this thesis demonstrates a multi-motor condition monitoring scheme which can substantially reduce implementation cost for some industrial plants. The proposed multi-motor condition monitoring scheme builds on top of the technology implemented in modern Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) for motor protection and control. The backbone of this scheme is the broadly accepted Ethernet technology and the IEC 61850 communication standard. Due to the widespread use of IEC 61850 in various industries, cost of the technology is significantly reduced while reliability has been improved. Based on the proposed systems, various applications can be developed to achieve remote condition monitoring of induction motors. Thesis (Ph. D.)
