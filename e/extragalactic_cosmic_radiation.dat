40|$|SURFACE DEFORMATION IN NORTHERN CHILE’S CENTRAL ANDES FOREARC (19 ° 10 "- 21 ° 30 "S) : COMPETITION BETWEEN INTERPLATE AND INTRAPLATE DEFORMATION PROCESSES This project {{addressed}} {{the problem of}} surface deformation of curved continental margins. The general objective {{was to understand the}} nature of processes controlling deformation in these types of margins. For case of study, the Coastal Mountain region located in the middle of the Salar Grande, south of Iquique, were chosen. Results achieved have enabled identifying and characterizing deformation processes of the upper crust in this region of the Central Andes. Results help understanding the basic processes related to tectonics of active continental margins and to the activity of faults spread on the surface of the earth. The main methodological component of this project was a case study with a significant field component and through the study of numerical models for elevation of the field. These applications were complemented with datings through cosmogenic isotopes that correspond to isotopes formed by the interaction between mineral atoms and the <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiation.</b> Numerical numbers based on finite differences were developed to understand the origin of secondary structures associated to the faults. This modelling was developed on the basis of an Ecos-Conicyt cooperation project. One of its most outstanding results was obtaining exposition ages of geomorphological surfaces characterizing the relief of the Coastal Mountains and which are deformed by the faults. Ages obtained reveal that the oldest preserved surfaces are exposed in this region. Also, the youngest movement age of the Atacama Fault System was determined using this methodology. Methodology used consists of measuring the concentration of cosmogenic-origin isotopes accumulated in quartz pieces exposed on surfaces. Applying this tool in this project enabled proving the applicability of the method for dating tectonic deformations in extremely dry environments such as the North of Chile. Results were published in main stream journals on Science of the Earth such as Tectonics and the Revista Geologica de Chile. In general terms, results achieved have allowed getting an idea of tectonic processes affecting the Coastal Mountains near the Salar Grande and enable an approximate understanding of faults during the last 20 million years. Chronological and field arguments suggest that this deformation is still active, but with rather low movement rates on the faults, around 0. 01 mm/year. This information provides a general idea of the seismic vulnerability degree of the region due to the faults’ activity. The deformation observed is similar to that developed in the active continental margin of the Cascade Range in North America. It thus allows extrapolating what conditions are ruling over the deformation in curved continental margins. Achievements obtained by the project were four ISI publications (two already published, one accepted and one being prepared) and one book chapter. Moreover, eight presentations in national and international congresses were generated. Two lectures were given in foreign universities (USA and Germany) and one in Chile’s Geological Society. Three dissertations were made (two finished and one being finished) and one doctorate thesis in its last stage. Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica - CONICY...|$|E

I {{review the}} {{assumptions}} and observations that motivate {{the concept of}} the <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> background <b>radiation,</b> and the issues of energy accounts and star formation history as a function of galaxy morphological type that figure in the interpretation of the measurements of the extragalactic infrared background. 1. Fundamental Assumptions It is useful to begin by recalling the basic assumptions and observations that lead us to {{the concept of the}} <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> background <b>radiation,</b> as opposed to radiation surface brightness that may be some highly variable function of position and direction. Deep counts of objects detected at a broad range of wavelengths, from gamma ray sources to radio galaxies, are close to isotropic across the sky. It is an excellent bet therefore that the integrated radiation from observed sources plus those too faint to be detectable as individual objects also is quite to isotropic. This allows us to think of the local extragalactic radiation background as...|$|R

40|$|The {{origin of}} the {{particles}} in the highest energy end of the cosmic ray spectrum is discussed {{in the context of}} the wider problem of the {{origin of the}} whole <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiation</b> as observed at the Earth. In particular we focus our attention on the acceleration problem and on the transition from galactic to <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiation</b> has been a mystery since its {{discovery}} by Victor Hess in 1912. The cosmic-ray energy spectrum extends from a few GeV to above 1020 eV. As {{yet there is no}} experimental proof of the transition from Galactic to <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays, though it is believed that cosmic rays below about 1017.5 eV are of Galactic origin. While there is a consensus that supernovae (SN) explosions accelerate cosmic rays up to energies of ~1015 eV, experimental evidence has been difficult to obtain. The theoretical arguments are based upon the energy released in SN being sufficient to maintain the observed cosmic rays in the Galaxy, and the creation of strong shocks by SN enabling first order Fermi acceleration. Thus the tasks for future experiments are to confirm that supernovae are sites of the acceleration of hadronic cosmic rays up to the knee, and to determine the sources of the Galactic cosmic rays above 1015 eV.|$|R

50|$|<b>Extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> {{rays are}} very-high-energy {{particles}} that {{flow into the}} Solar System from beyond the Milky Way galaxy. The energies these particles possess are in excess of 1015 eV.|$|R
40|$|<b>Extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> ray protons with an {{injection}} {{spectrum of the}} type E − 2. 7 show a spectrum on earth with a dip due to the Bethe-Heitler pair production against the photons of the cosmic microwave background. The dip is produced in the energy region 10 18 − 4 × 10 19 eV with position and shape that reproduce with high accuracy the spectrum observed experimentally. This interpretation of the observed data predicts {{the existence of an}} energy scale that signals a possible transition from galactic to <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays. In fact, at energies lower than a characteristic value Ec ≈ 1 × 10 18 eV, determined by the equality between the rate of energy losses due to pair production and adiabatic losses, the spectrum of cosmic rays flattens in all cases of interest. In this model, the transition from galactic to <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays occurs at some energy below Ec, corresponding to the position of the so-called second knee. Another viable explanation of the observed data is based on a completely different approach assuming a mixed composition with protons and nuclei at energies E ≥ 10 19 eV. This scenario implies a transition from galactic to <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays at the ankle energies (∼ 10 19 eV). In the present paper we will review the main features of the dip model comparing it with the model of transition at the ankle. ...|$|R
