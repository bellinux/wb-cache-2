5|$|Romney {{sought to}} bring near-universal health {{insurance}} coverage to the state. This came after Staples founder Tom Stemberg told him {{at the start of}} his term that doing so would be the best way he could help people. Another factor was that the federal government, owing to the rules of Medicaid funding, threatened to cut $385million in those payments to Massachusetts <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> did not reduce the number of uninsured recipients of health care services. Although the idea of universal health insurance had not come to the fore during the campaign, Romney decided that because people without insurance still received expensive health care, the money spent by the state for such care could be better used to subsidize insurance for the poor.|$|E
5|$|The Scuppernong had {{remained}} largely undeveloped throughout history. In 1793, {{the town of}} Columbia was built on its banks, as were several boat landings. The Scuppernong is a blackwater river: it water is colored like black tea or coffee. The Scuppernong served {{as a means of}} transportation for the early settlers in this region of North Carolina. Since 1989 the Nature Conservancy has sought to protect it in its most natural state. In 2002 the Nature Conservancy offered to donate four tracts of land that they owned along the Scuppernong <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> would purchase three more tracts that became available that same year. The state agreed and in 2004 the area along the river was officially added to the state park system.|$|E

Daniels submitted a two-year $27.5 billion spending plan to the General Assembly which would result in a $500 million surplus that would be used to rebuild the state reserve funds to $1 billion. He proposed a wide range of budget austerity measures, including employee furloughing, spending reductions, freezing state hiring, freezing state employee wages, and a host of administrative changes for state agencies. The state had already been gradually reducing its workforce by similar freezes, and by 2011, Indiana had the fewest state employees per capita than any other state—a figure Daniels touted to say Indiana had the nation's smallest government.|$|E
25|$|A simple {{criterion}} for checking whether a density matrix is describing a pure or mixed state {{is that the}} trace of ρ2 is equal to 1 <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> is pure, and less than 1 <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> is mixed.

25|$|With the {{independence}} of the Dominions, the British Paramountcy over the princely states came to an end. The rulers of the states were advised to join one of the two dominions by executing an Instrument of Accession. Maharaja Hari Singh of Jammu and Kashmir, along with his prime minister Ram Chandra Kak, decided not to accede to either dominion. The reasons cited were that the Muslim majority population of the State would not be comfortable with joining India, and that the Hindu and Sikh minorities would become vulnerable <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> joined Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|But {{even if the}} tax {{had been}} {{passed on to the}} federal government, Hughes {{concluded}} that it was incidental. Relying heavily on Trinityfarm Construction Co. v. Grosjean, 291 U.S. 466 (1934), Hughes found the 2 percent gross income tax imposed a burden on the federal government that was inconsequential and remote. Even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> imposed a tax of 25 or even 50 percent, creating an immediate, direct, consequential burden, Congress had the legislative power to ensure that such a tax did not hinder or unduly burden the federal government.|$|E

25|$|Firstly, certain {{costs are}} {{difficult}} to avoid and are shared by everyone, such as the costs of housing, pensions, education and health care. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> does not provide these services, then for those on lower incomes, the costs must be borrowed and often those on lower incomes {{are those who are}} worse equipped to manage their finances. Secondly, aspirational consumption describes the process of middle income earners aspiring to achieve the standards of living enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts and one method of achieving this aspiration is by taking on debt. The result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the Second World War, the United Kingdom owed Argentina m$n 2 billion {{after the}} country had filled the gaps in food {{shortages}} during the war effort. Following what was then a worldwide trend, the private companies were nationalised by the government of Juan Perón, beginning in 1946 with the French railways and then purchasing the British railways after an agreement was signed cancelling the British debt in 1947. Perón later claimed in an interview that the British envoys had offered him a bribe of US$100 million <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> paid an extra m$n 6 billion for the railways on top of the debt cancellation.|$|E
40|$|Medicaid {{programs}} {{are paying for}} 23 per cent {{of the health care}} costs of AIDS patients nationally, and approximately 40 per cent of all AIDS patients will become dependent on Medicaid to pay for their health care. <b>The</b> <b>state</b> Medicaid programs were surveyed by mail for this research in mid 1987 to determine <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> covered AZT (Retrovir), if limits apply to this coverage, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> have or are developing AIDS-related policies, and if hospice care is a benefit. Forty-four states cover AZT (two additional states cover AZT only during inpatient hospital care), with most Medicaid programs placing some limit on coverage or reimbursement. Most states do not have special Medicaid coverage for AIDS care nor are they developing proposals or policies for this care. However, a number of states are developing or implementing AIDS-related policies through their Medicaid programs. These policies can become models for other Medicaid programs to follow <b>if</b> <b>the</b> incidence of AIDS increases in their states...|$|R

25|$|The state commissioners by {{this time}} had begun to grow very weary of the rivalry between Jaysburg and Williamsport.

The town of Dunnsburg even went as far as offering, free of charge, lots on which to build the buildings that would be required by the county government. It appeared as <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> commissioners would choose neither Williamsport nor Jaysburg, instead choosing the outpost of Dunnsburg.
