40|$|This paper compares and reconciles two {{new methods}} for {{cross-country}} {{comparisons of the}} cost efficiency of UK and Italian <b>investment</b> <b>firms</b> over the period 1995 ¿ 1998. It employs four different specifications of the stochastic frontier methodology, using a translog cost function {{in order to measure}} X-efficiency. The traditional common frontier reveals that Italian <b>investment</b> <b>firms</b> are nearly as efficient as UK firms. To overcome traditional limitations, two methods are used in this paper. They provide consistent results. The first method shows differences between the efficiency of the two countries by incorporating environmental variables into the cross-country common frontier. The second method shows differences in the efficiency of the domestic versus foreign <b>investment</b> <b>firms</b> in the two countries, by testing the ability to monitor and control on a cross-border basis. Finally, to identify <b>investment</b> <b>firms</b> that are both cost and profit efficient, we undertake a profitability test...|$|R

As a result, the value of the project declined, which made the resale of the project rights difficult.

DIFA had outbid Chicago developer Golub & Co., which then became the frontrunner. Golub, an international real estate investment company headquartered in Chicago, has closed on the office space portion of the project.

5|$|Clark {{set himself}} three initial goals in {{civilian}} life—to earn $40 {{million in the}} business world and practice philanthropy, to become an adjunct professor, and to become a professional golfer. Clark began a public speaking tour in the summer of 2000 and approached several former government officials for advice on work after life in government, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich, White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty, and Richard Holbrooke. Clark took McLarty's advice to move back to Little Rock, Arkansas, and took a position with the Stephens Group, an <b>investment</b> <b>firm</b> headquartered there. He took several other board positions at defense-related firms, and in March 2003 he amicably left the Stephens Group to found Wesley K. Clark & Associates.

5|$|Since {{the end of}} World War II, {{the major}} port city of San Francisco had been home to a sizable number of gay men {{expelled}} from the military who had decided to stay rather than return to their hometowns and face ostracism. By 1969 the Kinsey Institute believed San Francisco had more gay people per capita than any other American city; when the National Institute of Mental Health asked the Institute to survey homosexuals, the Institute chose San Francisco as its focus. Milk and McKinley were among the thousands of gay men attracted to San Francisco. McKinley was a stage manager for Tom O'Horgan, a director who started his career in experimental theater, but soon graduated to much larger Broadway productions. They arrived in 1969 with the Broadway touring company of Hair. McKinley was offered {{a job in the}} New York City production of Jesus Christ Superstar, and their tempestuous relationship came to an end. The city appealed to Milk so much that he decided to stay, working at an <b>investment</b> <b>firm.</b> In 1970, increasingly frustrated with the political climate after the U.S. invasion of Cambodia, Milk let his hair grow long.
