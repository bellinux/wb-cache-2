5000|$|A clam cleat (or <b>jam</b> <b>cleat)</b> {{in which}} the rope is held between two fluted {{stationary}} pieces. Such a cleat vaguely resembles two halves of a clam shell held back to back. It is more compact than a cam cleat, but the rope is less easily released under load.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A <b>jam</b> <b>cleat.</b> The rope {{is free to}} {{run around}} {{the lower part of}} the cleat (below the screws). The upper part is tapered so that the space between the cleat and the boat gets smaller closer to the screws. Hence the rope jams in the cleat when it is pulled downwards.|$|E

50|$|The {{mainsail}} {{does not}} have a boom is fully battened and is controlled by a main sheet with a 6:1 mechanical advantage. The main sheet system has ball-bearing block system with a ratchet and <b>jamming</b> <b>cleat.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Angel also virgin or maiden. A Norsemen {{invention}} used in sailing long {{ships from}} about the 10th century AD that predates blocks. They served {{the purpose of}} a block/jamb cleat in one unit. It was a flat section of wood about 150 high x 120 wide shaped like an angel/butterfly used in attaching stays to the hull. The V-shape at {{the lower part of the}} [...] "wings" [...] acted as a V <b>jam</b> <b>cleat.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The gripfid is an {{invention}} of the late knotting expert Stuart Grainger. [...] It is a small knotter's fid with an added [...] "grip", a hollow shaft that ends near the point with a vee {{that acts as a}} <b>jamming</b> <b>cleat.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A fid is a {{conical tool}} {{traditionally}} {{made of wood}} or bone. It is used to work with rope and canvas in marlinespike seamanship. A fid differs from a marlinspike in material and purpose. A marlinespike is used in working with wire rope, {{may be used to}} open shackles, and is made of metal. A fid is used to hold open knots and holes in canvas, and to separate the [...] "lays" [...] (or strands) of synthetic or natural rope for splicing. A variation of the fid, the gripfid, is used for ply-split braiding. It adds a <b>jamming</b> <b>cleat</b> to pull a cord back through the cord split by the fid's point.|$|R
