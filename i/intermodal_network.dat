We propose a planning algorithm for dynamic pickup- and delivery problems in <b>intermodal</b> <b>networks,</b> where freight is consolidated by means of reloads to reduce both costs and emissions. Based on an enumerative arc-expansion procedure, a large number of intermodal routes is generated for each order, of which we store the k best.

Compared to direct road transport, numerical experiments on various virtual problem instances show an average cost saving of 34 %, and an average reduction in CO 2 emissions of 30 %.

40|$|As {{global trade}} {{continues}} to increase, {{the energy and}} environmental impacts of freight movement in the US have {{become more of a}} concern. As such, the freight transport system needs to consider opportunities to meet customer objectives, while also meeting social goals. In the US there has been legislation enacted to address the growing impact that freight movement has on the environment, but there are limited tools to assist in the implementation of those polices. This research sets forth a process for creating a geospatial intermodal freight transportation (GIFT) model within ArcGIS {{that can be used to}} analyze freight movement under different economic and environmental scenarios. The GIFT model uses an <b>intermodal</b> <b>network</b> that connects various modes (rail, truck, and ship) via intermodal terminals. ArcGIS Network Analyst is used to create the <b>intermodal</b> <b>network</b> and conduct optimal route analysis for various network attributes. Routes along the network are characterized not only by temporal and distance attributes, but also by cost, energy, and emissions attributes. Decision makers can use the model to explore tradeoffs among alternative route selection across different modal combinations, and to identify optimal routes for objectives that feature energy and environmental parameters (e. g., least carbon dioxide intensive route).

40|$|AbstractIn {{the recent}} {{literature}} {{a lot of}} attention has been given to <b>intermodal</b> transportation <b>networks,</b> mainly related to inland freight mobility. In particular, the landside distribution of maritime containers from/to seaports {{has been the focus of}} many research works. In fact, seaports are now suffering the lack of space at maritime terminals and the growing congestion on their access routes with the inland connections. In this regard, a well established strategic choice for maritime terminals is to perform gateway operations at inland dry ports, especially when topological and environmental constraints prevent terminals from expanding. Following this idea, in this paper we deal with the problem of locating dry ports for freight mobility in <b>intermodal</b> <b>networks.</b> In particular, the containerized flows originating at the maritime terminals of the port of Genoa, Italy, towards inland destinations throughout rail and road itineraries are examined. The present problem fits in the class of capacitated multiple hub location problems.

40|$|A {{framework}} is presented {{which may be}} used to analyze and evaluate intermodal networks. An <b>intermodal</b> <b>network</b> can be defined as an integrated transportation system consisting of two or more modes. Modes on intermodal networks are connected through facilities which allow travelers and/or freight to transfer from one mode to another during a trip from an origin to a destination. The model may be used in the transportation planning field to make predictions regarding future network activity in terms of traffic volumes and travel costs, to evaluate alternative policies for mitigating congestion and reducing energy consumption and air pollution, and to aid the decision making process in terms of future transportation plans. To expedite and facilitate the effort of detailed <b>intermodal</b> <b>network</b> representation and analysis, the network model is interfaced with a Geographic Information System (GIS). This interface allows the user to take advantage of available sources of information on the physical components of the network, store the results of the proposed models in a GIS environment and display them in a spatial data format, and display several layers of information and create thematic maps to support planning and policy initiatives. The importance of the proposed interface as a delivery tool lies in the power of visual images to communicate technical information to non-technical people and simplify concepts.

This paper describes a space–time representation of an <b>intermodal</b> traffic <b>network.</b> It also integrates traffic flow, transit schedule, and park-and-ride facility to establish a linear integer programing network design model to maximize the tourist’s accessibility to a mega event within a multi-modal network. A Lagrangian relaxation and decomposition solution approach is developed to efficiently solve this problem. The numerical results show that building parking lots at proper locations with an optimized parking space capacity could be useful in terms of allowing more intermodal transfers, reduce individual’s travel time, and improve the special event visitors’ accessibility. In practice, the mega-event park-and-ride lots planning problem should be integrated with long-term transit development planning decisions to fully utilize/balance the potentially unused capacity of the facilities. Future research will also focus on algorithm enhancements, OD demand calibration/validation, as well as valuating potential applications with other network design models.|$|R
