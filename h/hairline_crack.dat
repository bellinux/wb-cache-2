50|$|Without centralizers, {{there is}} a high risk that a channel of {{drilling}} mud or contaminated cement will be left where the casing contacts the borehole. These channels can provide a path for a later blowout. Even a thin crack can be pushed open by the enormous pressure of oil from below. Then erosion of the cement can occur from high-velocity sand particles in the oil. A <b>hairline</b> <b>crack</b> can thus become a wide-open gushing channel.|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the book, Johnny's father appears enthusiastic about going to war, so much that at {{the beginning}} he is frustrated that he lacks the half-inch of height required to enlist. After the required height is lowered, he joins the war and is moved to the front line afterward. As the war continues, it takes its toll on Johnny's father's health, physique, and mentality. Johnny's father sends his son a newly whittled and painted soldier with every letter, but his creations appear increasingly grotesque throughout the book. This is reflected in the model of himself that he had sent. The brown paint of his clothes turns a moldy green, the wide grin on its face fades to a grim, mournful expression, a <b>hairline</b> <b>crack</b> comes down his chest, and a knothole begins to form in its chest.|$|E
5000|$|To {{the lower}} right {{of the back of}} the relief is a {{ligature}} combining the letters L and A, probably the mark of another carver or dealer, and most likely the initials of Lapo d'Antonio di Lapo, active at the Opera del Duomo and for a short period in 1506/7 one of Michelangelo's assistants. A chisel blow on the reverse seemingly from this earlier phase resulted in a <b>hairline</b> <b>crack</b> in the face of the Virgin that may only have become apparent as carving progressed. It is uncertain whether Michelangelo, known for his concern for his materials, was constrained by a shortage of ready alternatives or more accepting of flaws and confident in his ability to work round them after his success with the damaged block for David. The missing segment to the bottom right may be a result of an excess of his celebrated [...] "direct attack", while the five holes in the outer rim are variously dated and were intended for fixings.|$|E

50|$|The race {{started in}} light drizzle, making the new track surface treacherously greasy. As usual, Moss was lightning-quick and first {{off the line}} in his Aston Martin. Hawthorn’s more {{powerful}} Jaguar blasted past {{him on the back}} straight and led {{at the end of the}} first lap. On lap three, Paul Frère got it sideways in the narrow Esses and spun his Jaguar. Fairman, close behind in the sister car, slammed on the brakes and also spun, then de Portago arrived unsighted and with nowhere to go broadsided Fairman. All three cars got going again: Frère limped on but came to a halt on the Mulsanne straight. De Portago got a bit further but the Ferrari’s oil cooler was smashed. Fairman got to the pits but the damage was too severe to repair. Ten minutes gone and three works entries were already eliminated. Hill’s Ferrari barely managed to skate through his teammate’s oil, but soon his clutch started to fail. More drama occurred minutes later when Hawthorn came in from the lead with an engine misfire. It was eventually traced to a <b>hairline</b> <b>crack</b> in a fuel line - the delay and repair cost an hour, and 21 laps, and dropped the remaining works Jaguar out of contention.|$|E
50|$|Alastair Macaulay, chief dance {{critic for}} the New York Times, {{reviewed}} the 2002 National Theatre production of Pinter's Sketches while still drama {{critic for the}} London Financial Times; in this portion of his review of the whole program reprinted on Pinter's official website, he writes:Pinter's 1969 Night is beautifully acted by Douglas Hodge and Catherine McCormack. He recalls {{that the first time}} he held her was on a bridge; he recalls holding her breasts in his hands. She recalls no bridge, she recalls a different place, she recalls how he took her hand and gently stroked it. Has anyone ever caught more finely the differences between male and female feelings about heterosexual love than Pinter? Here, their differences of memory become almost a tragic divide. These two live together in what they call love, and yet on the memories of their initial and most intimate moments there is this unchangeable discrepancy. This <b>hairline</b> <b>crack</b> could become an abyss - at times it seems very large, but they live with it calmly. Pinter, now in his 70s, can still seem the most modern playwright alive, but again and again he puts himself at the end of long traditions. He is, it often seems, the last modernist, the last classicist, and, in plays like Night, the last romantic.|$|E
