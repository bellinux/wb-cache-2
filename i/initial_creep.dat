40|$|This report {{covers the}} {{conclusion}} of a multi-year project that examined the oxidation resistance of Al-rich coatings and a new project examining the effect of higher CO 2 contents on corrosion mechanisms in oxyfired coal-fueled boilers. The coating work primarily examined diffusion coatings for the steam side of typical ferritic (9 - 12 %Cr) and austenitic (e. g., Type 304 L) tube materials in accelerated testing at 650 °- 800 °C in wet air. The final phase of this work has attempted to obtain additional coating failures to determine a critical Al content (at coating failure) as a function of exposure temperature. However, no failures have been observed for austenitic substrates including> 25 kh at 700 °C and> 6 kh at 800 °C. Preliminary results are presented from the oxy-firing project, where the initial focus is on ferritic alloys.

40|$|Plastically {{deformed}} quartzites {{from the}} Betic Movement Zone (Betic Cordilleras, Spain) exhibit microstructures indicative of crystal plasticity on a mineral grain scale. Quartzites with dynamically recrystallized grain sizes larger than 10 μm have strong crystallographic preferred orientations, narrow grain boundaries, little creep damage, and an inverse proportionality of dislocation density and grain size. Mylonites with grain sizes smaller than 10 μm have low crystallographic preferred orientations, wide grain boundaries (up to 1000 Å), abundant creep damage, and decreasing dislocation density with diminishing grain size. This {{is thought to}} reflect a clear-cut shift in deformational regimes from dislocation creep to superplastic flow at 10 μm grain size. Superplasticity can be acquired by quartzites which suffer dynamic recrystallization to grain sizes smaller than 10 μm during an <b>initial</b> dislocation <b>creep</b> stage. Dislocation motion is the major accomodating mechanism for strain incompatibilities that arise during grain-boundary sliding in the mylonites. It seems reasonable to estimate flow stresses from unbound dislocation densities and dynamically recrystallized grain sizes in the tectonite specimens. In the mylonites, dynamically recrystallized grain size probably reflects the stress magnitude before the shift in deformational mechanisms, and an estimate for late stage stresses is provided by unbound dislocation densities.

The {{aim of the research}} is to investigate and segregate the three settlement stages of a raft and an isolated foundation, supported by soft clay improved by granular columns. For convenience, the programme of work is divided into two parts, in which : Part 1 examines the long term settlement performance of a smooth, rigid raft underlain by soft clay without granular columns, and with granular columns, under single and multiple configurations, at an area replacement ratio, As of 15 %; and Part 2 examines the long term settlement performance of an isolated footing underlain by soft clay without granular column and with a single granular column at an As of 33 %. The results obtained from Part 1 (raft foundation loading) of the experimental investigations challenge the effectiveness of granular columns to control foundation settlement over a prolonged period, when installed in soft clay under a range of loadings. The tests were carried out in instrumented, one dimensional testing chambers on samples (254 mm ɸ, 100 mm high) of kaolin and sleech. The results obtained from Part 2 (isolated foundation loading) of the experimental investigations suggest that granular columns are a viable option in reducing settlements (<b>initial,</b> consolidation and <b>creep)</b> in weak deposit under low bearing pressures, at which the soil is overconsolidated, and not particularly effective under moderate to high bearing pressures, at which the soil is normally consolidated.

The actual linking-up process of discrete microcracks with the macroscopic crack is simulated, with full account of the underlying physical mechanisms such as the nucleation, growth and coalescence of grain boundary cavities accompanied by grain boundary sliding. Results are presented for C*-controlled mode I crack growth under small-scale damage conditions. Particular attention is focused on creep constrained vs. unconstrained growth. Also the effect of grain boundary shear stresses on linking-up is investigated through shear-modified nucleation and growth models. The computations show a general trend that while an initially sharp crack tends to propagate away from the original crack plane, crack tip blunting reduces the crack growth direction. Under unconstrained conditions this can be partly rationalized by the strain rate and facet stress distribution corresponding to steady-state creep. ...|$|R

An {{example of a}} landslide that exhibited such behaviour was the Vaiont landslide that occurred in Italy, 1963, where {{the final phase of}} catastrophic collapse was preceded by several months of creep. Shear heating of the slip plane is a possible mechanism that has been invoked to explain the severity of the final collapse, however its possible effect on the creeping phase has not been fully investigated. In this context we present a model for the creeping movement of a landslide idealized as a rigid mass sliding on a thin clay layer. Heat production and excess pore pressure generation due to frictional heating, as well as their diffusion, are taken into account. The behaviour of the clay is modelled using rate process theory, which is a general theory quantifying time-dependent soil deformation on the basis of micromechanical considerations.

The creep deformation perpendicular to the grain was decreased by cross laminating. The creep deformation perpendicular to the grain of parallel-laminated woods (P⊥ type), that perpendicular to the grain of face laminae of cross-laminated woods (C⊥ type), and also that parallel to the grain of face laminae of cross-laminated woods (C║ type) tended to decrease with increasing density of species used for perpendicular-direction lamina. It was found that the extent of the decrease was greater in creep deformation than in initial deformation. The degrees of anisotropy for both deformations of laminated wood were markedly decreased by cross laminating. The extent of the decrease was much greater in creep deformation than in initial deformation and considerably smaller in buna with higher density than in sugi with lower density. The measured values of <b>initial</b> deformation and <b>creep</b> deformation of C⊥ type were almost equal to the calculated values obtained from the measured values of parallel-laminated woods, whereas the measured values of both deformations of C║ type were much greater than their calculated values and increased markedly with increasing shear compliance in cross section of perpendicular-direction lamina used for core.

The model equations were then solved by using an unconditionally stable numerical scheme and the results were compared with a similar existing model and data available from landslide case studies. It was found that the refined model gave different predictions for the slide’s acceleration and velocity which however were only marginally so in the time window of realistic run-out distances. Secondly, a thermo-poro-mechanical model for landslides was developed based on rate process theory. The model was initially used in an attempt to back-analyse a real landslide case. It was subsequently used to explore factors that influence the transition from an <b>initial</b> phase of <b>creep</b> to a final catastrophic phase. It was found that a threshold initial velocity separates the creep and collapse regimes, beyond which frictional heating leads to the final failure. A different thermo-poro-mechanical model for landslides based on a constitutive theory that combines a thermo-plasticity model with a creep model for soils was also developed. The model was initially used in an attempt to back analyse a real landslide. It is able to predict a transition between the creep and collapse phases. Thermal diffusivity of the shear band material plays a major role on the predicted duration of the creep phase. Finally a landslide model based on Perzyna’s visco-plasticity theory was also developed. It was found that the extremely low velocity predicted during the creep phase leads to insignificant heat dissipation inside the shearband making the prediction of thermal pressurization and collapse impossible with this model. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies showed}} {{the need for}} timber {{connections}} with high fire performance. Connections of members in timber structures commonly comprise steel connectors, such as dowels, screws, nails and toothed plates. However, multiple {{studies have shown that}} the presence of exposed metal in timber connections leads to a poor performance under fire conditions. Replacing metallic fasteners with non-metallic fasteners potentially enhances the fire performance of timber connections. Previous studies showed that Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) dowels can be a viable replacement for steel dowels and that Densified Veneer Wood functions well as a flitch plate material. However, as the resin matrix of GFRP dowels is viscoelastic, connection creep, which is not studied before, can be of concern. Also no research has been carried out on the fire performance of these connections. Therefore, a study of the creep behaviour and the fire performance of non-metallic timber connections comprising GFRP dowels and a Densified Veneer Wood flitch plate was performed, as is discussed in this thesis. Predictive models were proposed to determine the connection slip and load bearing capacity at ambient and elevated temperatures and in a fire. The material properties and heat transfer properties required for these models were determined experimentally and predictions of these models were experimentally validated. Furthermore, an adjustment of the predictive model of connection slip at ambient temperature allowed approximating the creep of the connection. The material properties, required for the creep model, were determined experimentally and predictions of the model were compared to results of longterm connection tests. The study confirmed that timber members jointed with non-metallic connectors have a significantly improved fire performance to timber joints using metallic connections. Models developed and proposed to predict fire performance gave accurate predictions of time to failure. It was concluded that non-metallic connections showed more creep per load per connector, than metallic connections. However, the ratio between <b>initial</b> deflection and <b>creep</b> (relative creep) and the ratio between load level and creep were shown to be similar for metallic and non-metallic connections...|$|R
40|$|A {{specimen}} of Opalinus clay from Mont Terri {{has been subjected}} to stress testing over a period of 532 days. Testing was undertaken by changing either (or both) of the axial and confining stresses in sharp steps followed by periods of between 4 and 82 days during which time the specimen was allowed to adjust to the new stress state. In this way, the drained consolidation, creep and rebound behaviour of an Opalinus clay specimen was examined. The test material was subjected to a maximum average effective stress of 38. 3 MPa. Volumetric strain data for both volume change and porewater displacement measurements indicate a small inflection in the standard geotechnical plot of void ratio against the logarithm of average effective stress at a value between 20 and 22 MPa. The negative slope of the consolidation curve (α) based on volume change measurements exhibits a general trend of increasing magnitude as effective stress rises. Even though the data do not exhibit the sharp increase in α indicative of classic virgin consolidation behaviour, it would appear that plastic yielding is occurring at an average effective stress below 20 MPa. Analysis of net porewater flow measurements suggest original interstitial fluid was not expelled from the specimen until average effective stress exceeded 20 MPa. Given the data available, an estimate for the preconsolidation stress in the region of 20 to 25 MPa seems reasonable. As effective stress rises the duration of the strain transients lengthen. As the induration state of the mudrock increases, strain traces are characterised by less well-defined transients, indicative of time-dependent plastic yielding at high effective stresses. The volumetric strain data for both volume change and porewater displacement shows similar transient behaviour. These results give an average principal strain ratio of 0. 252, suggesting the material is either mechanically anisotropic or behaving as a non-ideal elastic medium. Specific storage values derived from porewater displacement measurements show a general decreasing trend with increasing average effective stress and are in the range 1. 5 to 12. 5 × 10 - 6 m- 1. Data from volume change measurements are less sensitive to changes in effective stress and are in the range 1. 2 to 17. 5 × 10 - 6 m- 1. Elastic constants derived for undrained quantities are significantly higher than those for drained conditions by approximately one order of magnitude. Data suggests there is a transition in behaviour centred around an average effective stress of approximately 20 MPa. Analysis of creep curves can be broken down into three distinct responses. The Lemaitre model, as applied to Opalinus clay by Boidy (Boidy et al., 2002), was applied to the current test data. However the published model parameters failed to adequately fit the current data. Minor alteration of these parameters enabled modelling of the longer-term volumetric responses to be undertaken. The Lemaitre model did not predict the <b>initial</b> stage of <b>creep</b> very effectively. A much slower response time was seen in the current data, which was absent in the work by previous researchers. A power-law creep model was established. In general the fit was adequate for the volumetric strain observed, although these data exhibited some noise. In contrast, the fit of the axial strain data was not adequate and even the subdividing of the data into the individual creep stages failed to give an acceptable fit. A combination of power-law for the initial response and Lemaitre for the longer response may achieve a better prediction for this test stage. A numerical simulation was run using the 2 -dimensional coupled flow and deformation code STAFAN. Two phases of the testing were modelled separately. During Phase 1, the model was used in an attempt to fit the creep data. A reasonable fit was made to the first step axial strain data, but the extrapolation to later stages showed a progressive deviation from the data. In addition, the model made poor predictions for the radial strain and porewater flow data in all steps. These observations indicate that both the assumptions of linear elasticity and isotropic deformation are probably invalid for this specimen. During the second phase of testing, the axial and confining stresses were raised synchronously in a series of seven 4 MPa steps. In view {{of the results of the}} Phase 1 modelling, it was decided to treat each step of Phase 2 as a separate test and to use the model to parameterise the changing state of the specimen. Young’s modulus was significantly lower than those derived from volume and porewater displacement measurements, which can be explained by the over prediction of radial strain due to the simple linear-elastic assumption in the STAFAN model. It has been shown that the linear elastic deformation model is not a good analogue for the behaviour of this specimen. There are clear indications of non-linear responses to stress changes in the data and it seems likely that some form of viscoelastic or viscoplastic model should be adopted. In addition, the axial and radial strain responses would seem to be anisotropic, bringing further complexity to the model that should be employed...|$|R

Instead, after primary creep, the rate continually increases with creep strain [11, 12], 1. 31. A model of the processes controlling the intermediate temperature creep behaviour of Ni 3 Al has been suggested by Hemker et al 131. In primary creep, the octahedral glide of superpartial dislocation p:rirs, which have;I pl;in;ir dissociation, results in a comparatively high <b>initial</b> <b>creep</b> deformation rate. Subsequently, thermally activated crohs-slip of the screw segnients onto a cube plane to form K-W locks immobilizes the supcrdislocations.
