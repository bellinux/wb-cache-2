In direct-sequence spread-spectrum systems, successful communications require phase synchronization of the m-sequence in the incoming signal with a locally generated m-sequence at the receiver. Many acquisition schemes which extract {{the phase of}} an incoming m-sequence have been studied, {{but most of them}} assume coherent demodulation (which is usually not available during acquisition) and or independent samples (which introduce a loss in the effective signal to noise ratio (SNR)). This thesis investigates the performance of two m-sequence acquisition schemes in the presence of fading and data modulation.

The effects of fading and data modulation on our schemes' probability of false alarm, probability of detection and test length are thoroughly explored.

40|$|Abstract — Signal {{acquisition}} is {{the first}} operation stage of a GPS receiver that detects the presence of GPS signals and provides a coarse estimate of the code delay and Doppler frequency. GPS signal acquisition becomes a challenging problem when the signal is subject to attenuation and multipath <b>fading.</b> <b>In</b> practice, standard methods such as extending the integration time without any aiding information to increase processing gain are not always sufficient to acquire weak signals. This difficulty can be characterized by the probability of detection, false alarm and mean acquisition time. This paper exploits spatial antenna diversity to mitigate the multipath <b>fading</b> <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> the acquisition process. Equal gain combining of two independent antennas is considered in a standalone processing strategy. The performance is evaluated in terms of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC). The theoretical analysis is compared with Monte Carlo simulations and real GPS data results.
