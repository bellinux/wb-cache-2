It states: [...] "Thelma is a simple Norwegian maiden living alone with her father {{in the land of}} the midnight sun. Her father is one of the few remaining Vikings, famous in history. As such he is held in great reverence by his servants, who consider him somewhat in the nature of a king, and his daughter a princess. Outside of the years spent at school, Thelma has spent nearly all her time alone, her mother having died when she was a baby. When on a visit to her mother's grave, Thelma meets Sir Philip Errington, a distinguished young Englishman, who is touring Norway in his private yacht. Sir Philip is instantly attracted to her and, obtaining information as to where she lives, presents himself to Olaf, the Viking, and is finally admitted to his friendship and that of his daughter. Sir Philip woos and wins the fair Thelma for his bride, and with her sails back to England. In London, Thelma at once creates a favorable impression and is cordially welcomed by all of Sir Philip's friends, who comprise the nobility and aristocracy of the metropolis. Lady Clara, alone, of all Sir Philip's old friends, wishes Thelma harm. She has long felt an affection for Sir Phillip, and resents the fact that he spurned her love and chose his bride in far-off Norway. This wicked and designing woman determines to wreck Thelma's happiness, and force her to leave England. This she contrives to do, in making Thelma believe that Sir Philip no longer loves her, but that in truth his heart belongs to Lady Clara. As proof of her statement she shows Thelma a letter written to her by Sir Philip in which he pleads the cause of his friend, who is in love with Lady Clara, and wishes her to become his wife. This Lady Clara claims is a love letter written by Sir Philip to her. Thelma, heartbroken, believing she has lost her husband's love, returns to Norway, just as her father, the Viking, breathes his last. She, with his faithful followers, complies with his last wishes, which are that he shall be buried as his forefathers were before him â€“ sent out to sea in his burning ship. This form of burial had been that accorded to all Vikings for centuries past. After straining <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> final look at the departing ship, Thelma retraces her steps to her mother's grave, and there, feeling that she is absolutely alone, prays for the strength to live. Here in a rocky dell before the tomb of her mother, where first she met the man who won her heart, Sir Philip again finds Thelma. A few words suffice to show her how she has been tricked, and a fervent protestation of his love convinces her that she still has a place in his heart. In Sir Philip's arms she finds comfort for the loss of her father; she starts out bravely to again face the world, now sure of his unending love." ...|$|E

[...] I found her surrounded by interns frantically pumping intravenous fluids and stimulants into her.

60|$|Remember! But {{she said}} nothing. She raised <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant. It {{was but a}} glance; a little, tearful, timid glance. It kept Joe silent though, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time.|$|R
60|$|She lowered <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, {{as though}} to conceal the sudden soft flash.|$|E
60|$|She shut <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, {{as though}} {{in an effort to}} collect herself.|$|E
60|$|She half closed <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. When {{she looked}} at me again she was laughing.|$|E
60|$|Miriam came in, and {{advancing}} to the proud beauty, who remained seated, made an obeisance down to the very floor, without, however, taking <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant off Hypatia's face.|$|R
6000|$|FILIPPO (turns half round).

60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> glowed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, {{but she was}} disturbed, tremulous, agitated.|$|R
60|$|Yvonne {{had closed}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment as she entered; now she turned appealingly toward her guide.|$|E

50|$|A Voyage of Consolation (1897) was {{a sequel}} to internationally themed An American Girl in London. The autobiographical On the Other Side of the Latch (1901) was set in Duncan's garden in Simla, {{where she had been}} forced to spend seven months while {{recovering}} from her tuberculosis infection. Warkentin sees this work as <b>an</b> example of <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> commercial opportunity.|$|R
60|$|The pink color came {{slowly into}} <b>her</b> cheeks. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes,</b> raised <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment to his, were almost reproachful.|$|R
6000|$|LADY CICELY (releasing his hand). Oh, you are dreadful! Tear it, tear it. (She covers <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment to}} shut out the sight.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so {{glad that}} you have come," [...] she said, raising <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute to his. [...] "Father, you {{remember}} Lord Dorminster?" ...|$|E
60|$|She raised <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment as}} she said the words; and then they fell again, in all their {{gentleness}} and mildness, on his face.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> Verena <b>for</b> {{the moment}} {{appeared}} ironically-minded, {{she might have}} found <b>a</b> fresh subject <b>for</b> hilarity in the tremulous, tentative tone in which Olive made this inquiry. But it had not that effect; it produced the first manifestation of impatience--the first, literally, and the first note of reproach--that had occurred {{in the course of}} their remarkable intimacy. The colour rose to Verena's cheek, and <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant looked moist.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned and}} looked at her, met the {{appealing}} glance of <b>her</b> soft <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment and looked suddenly away.|$|R
60|$|I {{filled my}} pipe and re-lit it. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes,</b> seen <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant {{in the light}} of the match, looked dreamy.|$|R
60|$|He said nothing. Lady Ruth closed <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment as}} though from sheer fatigue. Suddenly she opened them again and looked him {{full in the}} face.|$|E
60|$|He {{released}} them reluctantly {{and stood}} looking at her. Miss Hartley after a brave attempt to meet his gaze, lowered <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> time neither of them spoke.|$|E

60|$|He stood, {{uncertain}} in balance, gazing upon her. Summoning all {{her strength}} she rose, {{the baby on}} one arm. By a cruel effort of will, moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where she bathed <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute in cold water; {{but she was too}} dizzy. Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair, trembling in every fibre. By instinct, she kept the baby clasped.|$|R
60|$|So {{great is}} the power of honest {{simplicity}} and a good digestion over guilty consciences that all Kashima did turn out, even down to the banjo; and the Major embraced the company in one expansive grin. As he grinned, Mrs. Vansuythen raised <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant and looked at all Kashima. Her meaning was clear. Major Vansuythen would never know anything. He was to be the outsider in that happy family whose cage was the Dosehri hills.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant, {{communicated with}} his own as I think they had never, never communicated with any other source of meaning; then she {{transferred}} them to her brother's face, where the sense went out of them, only to leave a dull sad patience. But there was something even in this flat humility that seemed to him to mock him, so that he flushed crimson with rage and spite and flung her away. [...] "You always were an idiot! Go to bed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not always," [...] she {{answered}} quietly, raising <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. [...] "There was a time, Everard, before that terrible tragedy--the {{last time you}} stayed at Dunratter--when I didn't gibe." ...|$|E
6000|$|She raised <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment to}} his, {{but there was}} more indignation than {{gratitude}} in the glance she threw upon him. [...] "I am very much obliged to you. Good-night!" ...|$|E
60|$|A violinist {{now held}} the stage, a Pole newly come to London. La Belle Nita closed <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> few minutes her sorrow seemed to throb to the minor music {{to which she}} was listening.|$|E
6000|$|The tired woman shut <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> tightly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, {{and then}} looked with them at Ann Veronica. [...] "What can you do?" [...] she asked.|$|R
