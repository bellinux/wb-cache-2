The introduction to the DSS indicates the time and expertise that is needed, the data requirements and the situations when mapping the endangered areas is most useful. The DSS itself has four stages. In stage 1, the key factors that influence the <b>endangered</b> <b>area</b> are identified, the data are assembled and, where appropriate, maps of the key factors are produced listing any significant assumptions. In stage 2, methods for combining these maps to identify the area of potential establishment and the area at highest risk from pest impacts are described, documenting any assumptions and combination rules utilised. When possible and appropriate, Stage 3 can then be followed to show whether economic loss will occur in the area at highest risk and to identify the <b>endangered</b> <b>area.</b> As required, Stage 4, described elsewhere, provides techniques for producing a dynamic picture of the invasion process using a suite of spread models.

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Scientific Panel on Plant Heath was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on two pest risk analyses made by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) on invasive alien plants (American skunk cabbage and floating pennywort). The Panel was in particular asked a) whether these organisms {{can be considered as}} harmful for the <b>endangered</b> <b>area</b> of the European Community and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in the plant health Directive 2000 / 29 /EC, and b) whether the identified management options are appropriate through an evaluation of their efficacy, feasibility and impact. This document presents the opinion of the Panel on Plant Health on the pest risk analysis made by EPPO on Lysichiton americanus Hultén and St. John. L. americanus is a yellow-flowered herbaceous perennial plant known as American skunk cabbage or yellow skunk cabbage. It can be terrestrial, semi-aquatic and even aquatic. It has been introduced into Europe intentionally as an ornamental garden plant. It is naturalised in several European countries including Ireland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and UK. However, invasive behaviour has been reported in parts of Europe, with local species extinction reported in Germany. L. americanus is considered an invasive alien plant by EPPO and is included on the EPPO Action List (pests which EPPO recommend member countries to consider for inclusion in their phytosanitary regulations), with the entire EPPO region considered an <b>endangered</b> <b>area.</b> In delivering this opinion the Panel conducted a detailed review of the EPPO pest risk analysis provided, using the internationally accepted standard for pest risk analysis for quarantine pests ISPM No 11. The available information shows that Lysichiton americanus can be considered an invasive species with potential to cause environmental damage to ecologically vulnerable wetland habitats. However, the factors contributing to invasive behaviour are not well characterised and thus the <b>endangered</b> <b>area</b> cannot be clearly defined. Despite the presence of L. americanus in at least nine European countries, clear evidence of environmental damage has been found only in restricted areas of Germany. A more detailed analysis is required to identify the key factors contributing to invasive behaviour. Although the Panel recognises that invasiveness of a plant in one area can be a signal for its invasiveness elsewhere, it concludes that the information provided in the EPPO document is insufficient to confirm that L. americanus qualifies as a quarantine pest for the EC. The Panel considers that the significant knowledge gaps identified in the pest risk assessment stage of the pest risk analysis preclude a detailed evaluation of management options at this stage. The Panel suggests that further work, including monitoring and surveillance, is needed to address the areas of uncertainty identified in the EPPO document, in order to identify the areas of the European Community at risk and enable management options to be considered. These include:a) the effect of abiotic factors on the establishment, development, reproduction, survival and dispersal of the plant in both the native and introduced range;b) the population dynamics of the plant in areas where it is present but not invasive;c) the volume of trade in L. americanus as an ornamental plant entering and moving within the EC, including further analysis of the pathways through which it can reach natural water bodies;d) the nature and occurrence of areas within the EC where conditions result in invasiveness of the plant, supported by the use of modelling and geographic information system (GIS) tools. the environmental damage caused by the plant in areas where it is invasive...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Plant Health was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on 30 pest risk assessments made by France on organisms which are considered by France as harmful in four French overseas departments, i. e. French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion. In particular, the Panel was asked whether these organisms {{can be considered as}} harmful organisms for the <b>endangered</b> <b>area</b> of the above departments, in the meaning of the definition mentioned in Article 2. 1. (e) of Directive 2000 / 29 /EC and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. This document presents the opinion of the Panel on Plant Health on the full[2] pest risk assessment conducted by France on Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) with French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion considered as <b>endangered</b> <b>area.</b> Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) is a well-characterised virus of the family Nanoviridae, which infects banana and plantain. The Panel examined in detail the risk assessment provided, and considered the accuracy and quality of the information provided and methods applied for pest risk assessment purposes. The review was based on the principles of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 11 [3]: Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO, 2007 b). Although the pest risk assessment could be improved, and additional information provided to substantiate the statements made and ratings given in the assessment, the Panel agrees with the conclusion of the French document that the phytosanitary risk associated with BBTV is extremely high. BBTV is a highly pathogenic agent for banana, and thus the Panel concludes that the negative economic consequences of its introduction are very high, both for commercial plantations of dessert bananas in Guadeloupe and Martinique and production of plantain and cooking banana in small holdings and private gardens throughout the PRA area[4]. The Panel concludes that BBTV has a high probability of entry and a high probability of establishment in the French overseas departments, and that the international movement of large quantities of vitroplants represents the most important entry pathway. The Panel further considers that virus indexing of mother plants used for vitroplant production, provides an effective means to prevent entry of BBTV. The overall conclusion of the Panel is that BBTV is appropriate for evaluation of pest risk management options for the endangered areas of French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC...|$|E

These drastic geomorphic changes have important implications with respect to natural hazards. The aim {{of this paper is}} to document the possible processes and consequences of such hazards, and to demonstrate how modern remote sensing and modeling techniques can be used for rapid assessment of potentially <b>endangered</b> <b>areas.</b> Three case studies are presented from the European Alps, the Andes and the Caucasus. They refer to hazards associated with glacial lake formation and growth, and possible related lake outbursts, as well as massive mass movement processes due to destabilization of large glacierized mountain walls. Due to the remoteness and difficult access in most high-mountain regions, satellite remote sensing is a highly appropriate tool for monitoring purposes in these areas. We outline here the range of currently available satellite sensor data and show how it can be used to identify potential hazard sources. Based on the detected critical areas, we use mass movement propagation models embedded in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to approximately delineate <b>endangered</b> <b>areas.</b> Such remote sensing and modeling based first-order hazard assessments are an important tool for further detailed studies, for land use planning, and for prevention and mitigation measures...|$|R
