40|$|Abstract Background The 1986 Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion {{coincided with}} a {{preponderance}} of research, worldwide, on the social determinants of health and health <b>inequities.</b> Despite {{the establishment of a}} 'health <b>inequities</b> knowledge base', the precise roles for municipal governments in reducing health <b>inequities</b> at the local level remain poorly defined. The objective {{of this study was to}} monitor thematic trends in this knowledge base over time, and to track scholarly prescriptions for municipal government intervention on local health <b>inequities.</b> Methods Using meta-narrative mapping, four bodies of scholarly literature - 'health promotion', 'Healthy Cities', 'population health' and 'urban health' - that have made substantial contributions to the health <b>inequities</b> knowledge base were analyzed over the 1986 - 2006 timeframe. Article abstracts were retrieved from the four literature bodies using three electronic databases (PubMed, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science), and coded for bibliographic characteristics, article themes and determinants of health profiles, and prescriptions for municipal government interventions on health <b>inequities.</b> Results 1004 journal abstracts pertaining to health <b>inequities</b> were analyzed. The overall quantity of abstracts increased considerably over the 20 year timeframe, and emerged primarily from the 'health promotion' and 'population health' literatures. 'Healthy lifestyles' and 'healthcare' were the most commonly emphasized themes in the abstracts. Only 17 % of the abstracts articulated prescriptions for municipal government interventions on local health <b>inequities.</b> Such interventions included public health campaigns, partnering with other governments and non-governmental organizations for health interventions, and delivering effectively on existing responsibilities to improve health outcomes and reduce <b>inequities.</b> Abstracts originating from Europe, and from the 'Healthy Cities' and 'urban health' literatures, were most vocal regarding potential avenues for municipal government involvement on health <b>inequities.</b> Conclusions This study has demonstrated a pervasiveness of 'behavioural' and 'biomedical' perspectives, and a lack of consideration afforded to the roles and responsibilities of municipal governments, among the health <b>inequities</b> scholarly community. Thus, despite considerable research activity over the past two decades, the 'health <b>inequities</b> knowledge base' inadequately reflects the complex aetiology of, and solutions to, population health <b>inequities.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDDecentralisation {{has been}} {{considered}} by many {{as one of the}} most important strategies in public sector reform in several of the developing countries. Both donors and governments have regarded decentralisation as a tool for national development through the realisation of the objectives of enhancing popular participation in development and the management of development at the regional or local level. Countries are expected to reap the benefits of decentralisation through improved service delivery, namely, through bringing service delivery closer to the consumers, improving the responsiveness of the central government to public demands and,thereby,reducing poverty and inequalities, improving the efficiency and quality of the public services and empowering lower levels of government to feel more involved and in control. However, decentralisation also has the potential to widen the gap in fiscal resources at the sub-national leveland this may, in turn, result in <b>inequities</b> in service delivery tocitizens of the same countryanddepending on where they live. Over the years Ghana has experimented with amix of decentralisation reforms with the current policy integrating elements of political, administrative and economic decentralisation. The current system of local government in Ghana is based on a decentralisation programme that was launched in 1988 with the introduction of district assemblies (DAs) by the Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC) government. Nevertheless, years after the launch of the decentralisation process there are still significant disparities and <b>inequities</b> between districts and regions in Ghana as regards health variables. This study set out to investigate the link between decentralisation and health <b>inequities</b> by exploring the spatial dimensions of health equities in Ghana. The thesis used a concurrent mixed method approach by combining a quantitative inequality indices analysis and a qualitative analysis of interviews with policy makers in both the health sector and the decentralised system. The analysis used household level data from the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey 2003 and 2008 to construct inequality curves and indices in order to illustrate the existing <b>inequities</b> across and within regions in Ghana after an increase in the intensity of decentralisation. The study then decomposed the indices to determine the extent to which these <b>inequities</b> were accounted for by variations both within the regions and between the regions. The thesis also used available data from the common fund records of district assemblies to assess the level of <b>inequities</b> in selected health resources across districts. The thesis then investigated the micro-foundations of health decentralisation using the qualitative and quantitative descriptive analyses. The analysis conducted revealed that <b>inequities</b> in maternal health utilisation decreased between 2003 and 2008 ‒the two data points used based on theresearch design. However,these <b>inequities</b> were attributed primarily to within region <b>inequities</b> as the level of between regions <b>inequities</b> was significantly lower for both the concentration index and the Theil’s index. However, although, at the regional level the general trend revealed that <b>inequities</b> had also decreasedbetween 2003 and 2008, some individual region s had recorded increases. The concentration index, which provided information on the gradient of the <b>inequities,</b> revealed that the health <b>inequities</b> in Ghana‒the total health <b>inequities</b> and also for both years between and within regions‒were pro rich. In the instances of the regional <b>inequities</b> these <b>inequities</b> generally manifested a pro rich nature, with the exception of the Upper East region which had showed pro poor <b>inequities</b> in 2008. The analysis of the district level <b>inequities</b> in selected health resources and as regards health facilities, doctors and nurses indicated that the distribution of these facilities favoured the richer districts as the <b>inequities</b> revealed a pro rich gradient. The <b>inequities</b> in the health facilities at the district level were highest in respect of the nurses, followed by doctors and health facilities with scores of 0. 32, 0. 29 and 0. 084 respectively. The analysis of the qualitative data corroborated the results of the quantitative analysis as it emerged that policy makers at all levels believed that, over the years since the decentralisation, <b>inequities</b> had reduced, albeit marginally. The policy makers highlighted the high levels of the <b>inequities</b> in health resources,especially human resources,as a major area of concern. However, they also raised major concerns regarding <b>inequities</b> within regions, arguing that a number of factors, includingthe nature of the decentralisation regime in Ghana, the variations in the economic strength of districts and certain political factors,continued to cause <b>inequities</b> within the decentralised system. They argued that these factors impacted on the ability of both districts and regions to address <b>inequities</b> at a local level. In addition, they also pointed to the need to re-examine the definition of <b>inequities</b> in the Ghana health sector, <b>inequities</b> which result from focusing the attention on a number of regions and areas to the detriment of others...|$|R

5|$|Research is a {{priority}} in terms of improving women's health. Research needs include diseases unique to women, more serious in women and those that differ in risk factors between women and men. The balance of gender in research studies needs to be balanced appropriately to allow analysis that will detect interactions between gender and other factors. Gronowski and Schindler suggest that scientific journals make documentation of gender a requirement when reporting the results of animal studies, and that funding agencies require justification from investigators for any gender <b>inequity</b> in their grant proposals, giving preference to those that are inclusive. They also suggest it {{is the role of}} health organisations to encourage women to enroll in clinical research. However, there has been progress in terms of large scale studies such as the WHI, and in 2006 the Society for Women's Health Research founded the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences (OSSD) and the journal Biology of Sex Differences to further the study of sex differences.|$|E
5|$|The {{dynamics}} of gender <b>inequity</b> are related with the ideological principles {{held by the}} ruling political regime. The imperial era was dominated by the social paradigm of Confucianism, which was a pervasive philosophy throughout the Orient. Confucian ideals emphasized morality, character, social relationship, and the status quo. Confucius preached jen (humanity) and the equality and educability of all people; Neo-Confucianists and Imperial leaders used his beliefs in social hierarchy, particularly in the family setting, for the physical and social oppression of women. As the Chinese government began to re-assimilate themselves into the global community in the late 19th to early 20th century, it shifted away from conventional Confucian ideals and women's role in society changed as well. After Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China in 1949, a change in traditional gender roles came about. Mao's death {{marked the beginning of}} the current communist administration, and an influx of international communications in the areas of commerce, politics and social ideals. Since the 1980s, under the new communist party, the women's rights movement has gained momentum and has become a national issue as well as a sign of modernization.|$|E

Lung cancer has overtaken all other types of cancer as {{the leading cause of}} cancer death in women, followed by breast cancer, colorectal, ovarian, uterine and cervical cancers. While smoking is the major cause of lung cancer, amongst nonsmoking women the risk of developing cancer is three times greater than amongst nonsmoking men.

Other important health issues for women include cardiovascular disease, depression, dementia, osteoporosis and anemia.

In France, health <b>inequities</b> have tended to increase since the late 1980 s. Numerous studies show the influence of social, economic, geographic and political determinants on health <b>inequities</b> across the life course. Exposure to environmental factors is uneven across the population and may impact on health and health <b>inequities.</b> In cities, green spaces contribute to creating healthy settings which may help tackle health <b>inequities.</b> Health in All Policies (HiAP) {{represents one of the}} key strategies for addressing social and environmental determinants of health <b>inequities.</b> The objective of this research is to identify the most promising interventions to operationalize the HiAP approaches at the city level to tackle health <b>inequities</b> through urban green spaces. It is a participatory interventional research to analyze public policy in real life setting (WHO Healthy Cities). Method/design It is a mixed method systemic study with a quantitative approach for the 80 cities and a comparative qualitative multiple case-studies of 6 cities. The research combines 3 different lens: 1 /a political analysis of how municipalities apply HiAP to reduce social <b>inequities</b> of health through green space policies and interventions 2 /a geographical and topological characterization of green spaces and 3 / on-site observations of the use of green spaces by the inhabitants.

Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals is likely to be compromised if <b>inequities</b> in health/healthcare are not properly addressed. Objective This study attempts to assess trends in <b>inequities</b> in selected indicators of health status and health service utilization in Malawi using data from the Demographic and Health Surveys of 1992, 2000 and 2004. Methods Data from Demographic and Health Surveys of 1992, 2000 and 2004 are analysed for <b>inequities</b> in health/healthcare using quintile ratios and concentration curves/indices. Results Overall, the findings indicate that in most of the selected indicators there are pro-rich <b>inequities</b> and that they have been widening during the period under consideration. Furthermore, vertical <b>inequities</b> are observed in the use of interventions (treatment of diarrhoea, ARI among under-five children), in that the non-poor who experience less burden from these diseases receive more of the treatment/interventions, whereas the poor who have a greater proportion of the disease burden use less of the interventions. It is also observed that the publicly provided services for some of the selected interventions (e. g. child delivery) benefit the non-poor more than the poor. Conclusion The widening trend in <b>inequities,</b> in particular healthcare utilization for proven cost-effective interventions is likely to jeopardize the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and other national and regional targets. To counteract the <b>inequities</b> it is recommended that coverage in poor communities be increased through appropriate targeting mechanisms and effective service delivery strategies. There is also a need for studies to identify which service delivery mechanisms are effective in the Malawian context. </p...|$|R
