5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired. The {{size of the}} gas nozzle depends upon the diameter of the electrode, the joint configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the welder. The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at least three times the diameter of the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but <b>fused</b> <b>quartz,</b> a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|E

It has very low thermal expansion, is very hard, and resists high temperatures (1000–1500°C). It {{is also the}} most resistant against weathering (caused in other glasses by alkali ions leaching out of the glass, while staining it). <b>Fused</b> <b>quartz</b> is used for high-temperature applications such as furnace tubes, lighting tubes, melting crucibles, etc.|$|E
25|$|A mercury-vapor lamp is a gas {{discharge}} lamp which uses mercury in an excited state to produce light. The arc discharge is generally confined to a small <b>fused</b> <b>quartz</b> arc tube mounted within a larger borosilicate glass bulb. The outer bulb may be clear or coated with a phosphor. In either case, the outer bulb provides thermal insulation, protection from ultraviolet radiation, and a convenient mounting for the <b>fused</b> <b>quartz</b> arc tube.

A first version of the 6L6 used a metal envelope sealed with glass beads, while a glass disk fused to the metal was used in later versions. Metal and ceramic are used almost exclusively for power tubes above 2kW dissipation. The nuvistor was a modern receiving tube using a very small metal and ceramic package.|$|E

50|$|The bulb {{must be made}} of <b>fused</b> silica (<b>quartz)</b> or a {{high-melting-point}} glass (such as aluminosilicate glass). Since quartz is very strong, the {{gas pressure}} can be higher, which reduces {{the rate of evaporation}} of the filament, permitting it to run a higher temperature (and so luminous efficacy) for the same average life. The tungsten released in hotter regions does not generally redeposit where it came from, so the hotter parts of the filament eventually thin out and fail.|$|R

The sputtering powers of ZnO and Si are fixed at 75 and 110  W, and the effective thicknesses of each ZnO and Si layer are fixed at 5 and 3  nm, respectively. After deposition, the ZnO/Si ML thin films are annealed at 500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C, or 800 °C for 30  min in N 2 environment. For electrical measurements, 100 -nm-thick Al and Ni metal layers are deposited {{on the top and}} bottom surfaces of devices as electrodes using a thermal coater. The Raman spectra are measured using a 488 -nm diode-pumped solid-state laser (HORIBA LabRam HR, HORIBA, Kyoto, Japan). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are examined by a Bede-D 1 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (Bede Scientific, Engelwood, CO, USA). The transmittance spectra are obtained using a UV–vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Hitachi U- 4100, Hitachi Ltd., Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan). The cross-sectional morphologies are observed by a JSM- 6500  F field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM; JEOL Ltd., Akishima, Tokyo, Japan).

25|$|The GP-B gyro {{consists}} of a nearly-perfect spherical rotating mass made of <b>fused</b> <b>quartz,</b> which provides a dielectric support for {{a thin layer of}} niobium superconducting material. To eliminate friction found in conventional bearings, the rotor assembly is centered by the electric field from six electrodes. After the initial spin-up by a jet of helium which brings the rotor to 4,000 RPM, the polished gyroscope housing is evacuated to an ultra-high vacuum to further reduce drag on the rotor. Provided the suspension electronics remain powered, the extreme rotational symmetry, lack of friction, and low drag will allow the angular momentum of the rotor to keep it spinning for about 15,000 years.|$|E
25|$|An {{incandescent}} light bulb, incandescent lamp or {{incandescent light}} globe is an electric light {{with a wire}} filament heated to such a high temperature that it glows with visible light (incandescence). The filament, heated by passing an electric current through it, is protected from oxidation with a glass or <b>fused</b> <b>quartz</b> bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated. In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is slowed by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life. The light bulb is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass. Most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections.|$|E
500|$|While {{working on}} his thesis, Mayall had an idea of {{designing}} a small, fast slitless spectrograph, optimized for nebulae and galaxies. [...] He believed {{that if it were}} used in conjunction with the Crossley reflector it would make that facility competitive for {{at least some of the}} work that Humason and Hubble were doing with the larger Mt. Wilson telescopes. [...] It was never expected to compete with the Mt. Wilson [...] instrument for stars or elliptical galaxies, which have condensed and relatively bright nuclei. The spectrograph was to be used instead to study extended, low-surface-brightness gaseous nebulae or irregular galaxies. [...] Mayall's thesis advisor, William Hammond Wright, and the then head of the Lick stellar spectroscopy program, Joseph Haines Moore, encouraged him to develop his spectrograph. [...] The device was constructed by the Lick Observatory's own workshop, and proved to be more efficient for extended, low-surface-brightness objects, particularly in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, thus confirming the expectations of Mayall. With Wright's strong encouragement, Mayall had used <b>fused</b> <b>quartz</b> to make ultraviolet transmitting optics, whereas the Mt. Wilson spectrographs used heavy glass lenses and prisms, which absorb ultraviolet radiation.|$|E

As shown in Fig. 4, RF MEMS components can be fabricated in class 100 clean rooms using 6 to 8 optical lithography steps with a 5 μm contact alignment error, whereas state-of-the-art MMIC and RFIC fabrication processes require 13 to 25 lithography steps.|$|R
5000|$|Halogen lamps {{are usually}} {{much smaller than}} {{standard}} incandescents, because for successful operation a bulb temperature over 200 °C is generally necessary. For this reason, most have a bulb of <b>fused</b> silica (<b>quartz),</b> but sometimes aluminosilicate glass. This is often sealed inside an additional layer of glass. The outer glass is a safety precaution, reducing UV emission and because halogen bulbs can occasionally explode during operation. One reason is if the quartz bulb has oily residue from fingerprints. The risk of burns or fire is also greater with bare bulbs, leading to their prohibition in some places unless enclosed by the luminaire.|$|R

Ordinary A-glass ("A" [...] for [...] "alkali-lime") or soda lime glass, crushed and ready to be remelted, as so-called cullet glass, was the first type of glass used for fiberglass.

It now makes up most of the fiberglass production in the world, and also is the single largest consumer of boron minerals globally. It is susceptible to chloride ion attack and is a poor choice for marine applications. S-glass ("S" [...] for [...] "Strength") is used when high tensile strength (modulus) is important, and is thus important in composites for building and aircraft construction.

Interrelations between photocount bunching arising in the SNDP and the antibunching character arising from dead-time effects are investigated. It is demonstrated that the dead-time-modified count mean and variance for an arbitrary doubly stochastic Poisson point process can be obtained from the Laplace transform of the single-fold and joint-moment-generating functions for the driving rate process.
