40|$|Simultaneous {{mixing and}} {{segregation}} of granular materials is of considerable practical importance; the interplay among both processes is, however, poorly understood from a fundamental viewpoint. The {{focus of this}} work is radial segregation-core formation-due to density in a rotating cylinder. The flow regime considered is the cascading or continuous flow regime where {{a thin layer of}} solids flows along a nearly flat free surface, while the remaining particles rotate as a fixed bed along with the cylinder. The essence of the formation of a central segregated core of the more dense particles lies in the flow, mixing, and segregation in the cascading layer. The work involves experiments and analysis. A constitutive model for the segregation flux in cascading layers is proposed and validated by particle dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations for steady flow down an inclined plane. The model contains a single parameter, the <b>dimensionless</b> segregation <b>velocity</b> (beta), which is treated as a fitting parameter here. Experimental results for the equilibrium segregation of steel balls and glass beads are presented for different fractions and different extents of filling. There is a good match between theoretical predictions and all experimental results when the value of <b>dimensionless</b> segregation <b>velocity</b> is taken to be beta= 2. The extent of segregation is found to increase with increase in the <b>dimensionless</b> segregation <b>velocity</b> and <b>dimensionless</b> diffusivity but is independent of the level of filling.
