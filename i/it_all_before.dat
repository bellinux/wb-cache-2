25|$|Cullum {{produced}} {{his first}} album, Jamie Cullum Trio—Heard <b>it</b> <b>All</b> <b>Before,</b> with only £480. It {{was released in}} 1999 with only 500 copies made. Due to their rarity, original copies have sold {{for as much as}} £600 on eBay. The success of the album led to an invitation to Cullum to appear on Geoff Gascoyne's album Songs of the Summer.|$|E
25|$|In So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish (published in 1984), Arthur {{returns home}} to Earth, rather {{surprisingly}} {{since it was}} destroyed when he left. He meets and {{falls in love with}} a girl named Fenchurch, and discovers this Earth is a replacement provided by the dolphins in their Save the Humans campaign. Eventually he rejoins Ford, who claims to have saved the Universe in the meantime, to hitch-hike one last time and see God's Final Message to His Creation. Along the way, they are joined by Marvin, the Paranoid Android, who, although 37 times older than the universe itself (what with time travel and all), has just enough power left in his failing body to read the message and feel better about <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>before</b> expiring.|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{admitted}} that the chorus of the song is triumphant. Chris Norris of Blender wrote that the song [...] "evokes both early-'80s dance giants the S.O.S. Band and early-'80s dance giant Madonna." [...] Matt Zabosek of The Chicago Maroon wrote: [...] "...'Get Together' is probably the best, but it's hard not to feel that Madonna's computerized voice is a cheat (perhaps to cover for the high notes she can no longer reach?)" [...] Diego Costa of The UWM Post in review of the song, wrote: [...] "In this one-step-up-from-lounge-track, Madonna is a teen again, wondering {{if there is such}} a thing as love at first sight. But in the end, as a wise woman, she realizes that whether it exists or not, she doesn't care, since 'all is just an illusion.' Yeah, we heard <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>before,</b> she will even admit it in the following track, but it doesn't mean we don't want to hear it again." [...] In 2007, the song was nominated in the category of Best Dance Recording at the 49th Grammy Awards but lost to Justin Timberlake's 2006 single [...] "SexyBack".|$|E

6000|$|Little Joe laughed. [...] "What's the matter, Jerry? 'Fraid I'll eat <b>it</b> <b>all</b> up <b>before</b> you get here?" [...] he asked, as {{he reached}} out for the fish.|$|R
2500|$|However, Andy Gill from The Independent {{awarded the}} album two stars. He criticised Minogue's lack of {{creative}} delivery, by stating [...] "But they’re let {{down by the}} lack of character in Kylie’s delivery, most notably on “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town”, a posthumous duet with Frank Sinatra, where his easy, relaxed manner is in sharp contrast to her discomfort." [...] He commended the musical diversity of the tracks, highlighting [...] "Let It Snow", [...] "Winter Wonderland", and [...] "Every Day's Like Christmas", and highlighted [...] "White December", [...] "Cried Out Christmas", and [...] "Christmas Wrapping" [...] as the best tracks. Lauren Murphy from The Irish Times argued the relevance of the album, by stating [...] "We’ve heard <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>before,</b> so do we really need another pop star doing another bog-standard Christmas album with a sprinkling of festive cheese? To be fair, Kylie Minogue is better placed than most to do such an album, given her longevity in the business." [...] Murphy concluded [...] "2,000 Miles {{is one of the few}} saving graces on yet another inessential album that will have no bearing on your enjoyment of the festive season whatsoever." [...] Several publications mentioned the album on their anticipated releases of 2015, including the Daily Mail, and Unrealitytv.co.uk.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{believe they}} did; {{but it was}} years ago, and very many years ago, too, since they lived there. Why you'd have to pull <b>it</b> <b>all</b> down, <b>before</b> you began to build it up!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{go on to}} {{the first}} bend, and see if <b>it's</b> <b>all</b> right <b>before</b> we begin to race," [...] Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like a young Russian in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.|$|R
6000|$|Kate {{maintained}} her wonderful manner, {{the manner}} of at once having <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>before</b> her and yet keeping it all at its distance. [...] "She wouldn't see you?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That it is," [...] said Lionel, [...] "only {{things never}} seem {{so at the}} time. I wish they did, but. I am glad my father saw <b>it</b> <b>all</b> right <b>before,</b> {{and said he was}} glad she had given him up." ...|$|R

"And {{now you are}} broken-hearted {{because he}} did not blurt <b>it</b> <b>all</b> out <b>before</b> Colonel Askerton in a {{business}} interview, which was very properly had at once, and in which he has had the exceeding good taste to confine himself altogether to the one subject." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I don't mean that. I mean {{on the way}} to our valley. Because the way--all ways--to our valley must be beautiful. And this; I've seen <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>before,</b> dreamed it." ...|$|E

"Why, {{they make}} the capital," [...] said Enoch; [...] "and if {{they make the}} capital, is it not strange {{that they should not}} be able to {{contrive}} some means to keep the capital? Why, Job was saying the other day that there was nothing like a principle to work upon. <b>It</b> would carry <b>all</b> <b>before</b> <b>it.</b> So say I. And I have a principle too, though it is not Master Thornberry's. But <b>it</b> will carry <b>all</b> <b>before</b> <b>it,</b> though it may not be in my time. But I am not so sure of that." ...|$|R
50|$|After FMW's demise, Kanemura joined Fuyuki's World Entertainment Wrestling, {{which lasted}} until May 2004.

6000|$|About my {{coming to}} Europe, I {{get more and}} more doubtful, and rather incline to Ceylon again as place of meeting.
