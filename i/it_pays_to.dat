It became a success on tour from 1921 and in another London theatre in 1922. Lawrence Grossmith had acquired the rights to Travers's farce A Cuckoo in the Nest and sold them to Walls.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{people with}} Medicare can get {{prescription}} drug coverage through a Medicare Advantage plan or through the standalone private prescription drug plans (PDPs) established under Medicare Part D. Each plan established its own coverage policies and independently negotiates the prices <b>it</b> <b>pays</b> <b>to</b> drug manufacturers. But because each plan has a much smaller coverage pool than the entire Medicare program, many argue that this system of paying for prescription drugs undermines the government’s bargaining power and artificially raises the cost of drug coverage.|$|E

25|$|Travers {{followed}} The Dippers {{with another}} farcical novel, A Cuckoo in the Nest, published in 1922. Again reviewers praised its humour, and again Travers {{turned it into}} a playscript. The actor Lawrence Grossmith spotted the dramatic possibilities of this story, and he acquired the performing rights to the play. Before Grossmith had time to produce the piece, he had an offer from the actor-manager Tom Walls to buy the rights. Walls was in need of a replacement for his current hit farce, <b>It</b> <b>Pays</b> <b>to</b> Advertise, which was nearing {{the end of a long}} run at the Aldwych Theatre.|$|E

Channel 4 originally operated as a CBS affiliate—having inherited the affiliation through the CBS Radio Network's longtime relationship with KRLD (AM), which became the first radio station in Texas to affiliate with the television network's radio predecessor in 1927. The first program ever broadcast on KRLD-TV on that afternoon was the CBS game show <b>It</b> <b>Pays</b> <b>to</b> Be Ignorant; the first local program aired on the station that day was a college football game in which the Notre Dame Fighting Irish defeated the Southern Methodist Mustangs, 27-20.|$|E

500|$|Lombard {{appeared}} in five films released during 1931, {{beginning with the}} Frank Tuttle comedy <b>It</b> <b>Pays</b> <b>to</b> Advertise. Her next two films, Man of the World and Ladies Man, both featured William Powell, Paramount's top male star. Lombard had {{been a fan of}} the actor before they met, attracted to his good looks and debonair screen persona, and they were soon in a relationship. The differences between the pair have been noted by biographers: she was 22, carefree, and famously foul-mouthed, while he was 38, intellectual, and sophisticated. Despite their disparate personalities, Lombard married Powell on June 6, 1931, at her Beverly Hills home. Talking to the media, she argued for the benefits of [...] "love between two people who are diametrically different", claiming that their relationship allowed for a [...] "perfect see-saw love".|$|E

AOL TV's Jason Hughes applauded the uncommon structuring of the episode, writing: [...] "So {{why was this}} episode so much more fun than usual? We {{think it has to}} do with the format and the playfulness in the presentation. After two decades, <b>it</b> <b>pays</b> <b>to</b> shake things up and give us a completely fresh look at the show. Even the team created some new combinations from the massive Springfield citizenry. Maybe they should consider doing that more often." [...] Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "entertaining and successful", commenting that [...] "element of surprise is the key here, and The Simpsons did something quite surprising tonight, combining a parody of heist movies with a sharp satirical look at book mill publishing. With the successful guest appearances by both Neil Gaiman and Andy García, this episode delivered an increasingly rare treat for Simpsons fans: a well-written and well-acted half-hour that gets better and funnier as it goes." [...] Childs did, however, criticize the [...] "split screens of various heist-style shenanigans" [...] as the [...] "least amusing part of the episode."
