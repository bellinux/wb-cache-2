40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of {{humidity}} and dust trapped in avalanche region on leakage current of bulk micro-MEGAS detector is studied. Pyralux PC 1025 layers of DuPont are introduced in bulk technique and micro-MEGAS detector with pillars of 300 μm in diameter is fabricated. Leakage current is tested in air with different humidity. Silicon carbide powder and PMMA (polymethyl <b>methacrylate)</b> <b>powder</b> are added as dust to avalanche region. Leakage current with and without powder is tested in air and results are depicted in the same figure. Test results indicate that leakage current increases with both storage humidity and test humidity, and also increases when powder is introduced in avalanche region. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} how pulsed laser Raman excitation (approximately 1 ps) followed by fast optical Kerr gating (approximately 4 ps) {{can be used}} to effectively separate Raman signals originating from different depths in heterogeneous diffusely scattering media. The diffuse scattering slows down photon propagation through turbid samples enabling higher depth resolution than would be obtained for a given instrumental time resolution in an optically transparent medium. Two types of experiments on two-layer systems demonstrate the ability to differentiate between surface and sub-surface Raman signals. A Raman spectrum was obtained of stilbene powder buried beneath a 1 mm over-layer of PMMA (poly(methyl <b>methacrylate))</b> <b>powder.</b> The signal contrasts of the lower stilbene layer and upper PMMA layer were improved by factors &# 62;or= 5 and &# 62;or= 180, respectively, by rejecting the Raman component of the counterpart layer. The ability to select the Raman signal of a thin top surface layer in preference to those from an underlying diffusely scattering substrate was demonstrated using a 100 mum thick optically transparent film of PET (poly(ethylene terephthalate)) on top of stilbene powder. The gating resulted in the suppression of the underlying stilbene Raman signal by a factor of 1200. The experiments were performed in back-scattering geometry using 400 nm excitation wavelength. The experimental technique should be well suited to biomedical applications such as disease diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Porous Ti with {{an average}} pore size of 200 - 400 µm and {{porosity}} {{in the range of}} 25 - 50 % has been manufactured using polymethyl <b>methacrylate</b> (PMMA) <b>powders</b> as spacer particles. The stress distribution of porous Ti was analyzed by Ansys software. The stress is prone to focusing on the surrounding of connected pore and weak cell. As the porosity and pore size increase, the concentration factor of stress increases due to the lager degree of pore connection and aggregation. Comparing with the ellipsoid pore model, the concentration factor of stress of the porous Ti with spherical pore is lower...|$|R
40|$|A {{flexible}} <b>methacrylate</b> <b>powder</b> dressing (Altrazeal®) transforms into a wound contour conforming matrix once {{in contact}} with wound exudate. We hypothesised that it may {{also serve as a}} drug delivery vehicle for antiseptics. The antimicrobial efficacy and influence on bacterial growth kinetics in combination with three antiseptics was investigated in an in vitro porcine wound model. Standardized in vitro wounds were contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; ATCC 33591) and divided into six groups: no dressing (negative control), methacrylate dressing alone, and combinations with application of 0. 02 % Polyhexamethylene Biguanide (PHMB), 0. 4 % PHMB, 0. 1 % PHMB + 0. 1 % betaine, 7. 7 mg/mL Povidone-iodine (PVP-iodine), and 0. 1 % Octenidine-dihydrochloride (OCT) + 2 % phenoxyethanol. Bacterial load per gram tissue was measured over five days. The highest reduction was observed with PVP-iodine at 24 h to log 10 1. 43 cfu/g, followed by OCT at 48 h to log 10 2. 41 cfu/g. Whilst 0. 02 % PHMB resulted in a stable bacterial load over 120 h to log 10 4. 00 cfu/g over 120 h, 0. 1 % PHMB + 0. 1 % betaine inhibited growth during the first 48 h, with slightly increasing bacterial numbers up to log 10 5. 38 cfu/g at 120 h. These results indicate that this flexible methacrylate dressing can be loaded with various antiseptics serving as drug delivery system. Depending on the selected combination, an individually shaped and controlled antibacterial effect may be achieved using the same type of wound dressing...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} a newly developed polymethyl <b>methacrylate</b> (PMMA) <b>powder.</b> Methods: The particle size distribution, surface area, and particle shape of both new and traditional powders were compared. The shear bond strength of the resin cement with the new powder to a silver-palladium-copper-gold alloy was determined and compared to that for a cement with the traditional powder. Also, the weight of mixture held by the brush at one time of both powders was also calculated and compared as an index of mixability. Results: The surface area of the new powder was smaller than that of the traditional powder, while the particles size distributions were similar. The new powder included various-sized spherical particles as well as irregular particles, while the traditional powder consisted of only irregular particles. The new powder showed significantly higher mixability, although its bond strength was not significantly different from that of traditional powder. Conclusion: The results of this study show that the interminglement of spherical and irregular particles cannot influence the bond strength to the alloy but is helpful to improve the working properties...|$|R
40|$|Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) {{filled with}} {{hydroxyapatite}} (HA) filler {{has been widely}} used in biomaterial application. Acrylic denture base material was prepared from PMMA filled with HA. This research work attempted to investigate the effects of hydroxyapatite (HA) on the flexural properties, fracture toughness, and thermal properties of poly(methyl <b>methacrylate).</b> PMMA <b>powder</b> was mixed with monomer of methyl methacrylate (MMA) stabilized with hydroquinone. Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) were used as initiator and crosslinking agent, respectively. The HA loading was ranged from 5 - 20 %. The PMMA/HA composites were prepared by using heat-processing polymer powder and liquid method. The polymerization of PMMA/HA were carried using water bath. The thermal properties of the PMMA/HA composites were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The flexural modulus of PMMA was increased {{by the addition of}} HA. This is attributed to the reinforcement effects of HA. Experimental data of flexural modulus for PMMA/HA composites was compared with several theoretical models and equations. In addition, {{it was found that the}} storage modulus (E’), glass transition temperature (Tg), and fracture toughness properties of PMMA were influenced by the HA loading...|$|R
30|$|In the experiment, {{we first}} {{dissolved}} poly(methyl <b>methacrylate)</b> (PMMA) <b>powder</b> (996  kg/mol, Sigma Aldrich) with 10  wt./vol.% concentration in DMF. In parallel, we dissolved ANN or CNN (99.999 % purity, Sigma Aldrich) in DMF with varying concentrations of 1 – 10  wt./vol.%. Afterwards, we mixed the as-prepared PMMA solution {{and the salt}} solution with 1 : 1 volume ratio and obtained a uniform clear solution. As such, the final solution for spin-coating contains 0.5 – 5  wt./vol.% metal salt and 5  wt./vol.% PMMA, leading to a weight/volume ratio of metal salt and PMMA ranging from 1 : 10 to 10 : 10. The solution in DMF was homogeneous to give a smooth thin film after spin-coating on a substrate. The reason for choosing DMF as the solvent {{can be found in}} our previous work [26]. It is known that metal salts are generally soluble in water whereas polymers are soluble in organic solvents such as benzene, toluene, and tetrahydrofuran (THF). We studied several solvents and found out that our metal salts are soluble in THF, acetic acid, and DMF, which also dissolve PMMA powder. We finally chose DMF solvent because it gives more uniform and smooth salt-PMMA composite film upon spin-coating and thermal annealing process.|$|R

Because inadequate mixing of the recipe components during the manufacture of the bone cement may compromise the mechanical properties of the final pieces, new techniques to incorporate the fillers into the BC and their effect upon the mechanical properties of BC pieces were investigated in the present study. PMMA powder composites were produced in-situ in the reaction vessel by addition of X-ray contrasts to the reacting MMA mixture. It is shown that {{this can lead to}} much better mechanical properties of test pieces, when compared to standard bone cement formulations, because enhanced dispersion of the radiopaque agents can be achieved. Moreover, it is shown that the addition of hydroxyapatite (HA) and acrylic acid (AA) to the bone cement recipe can be beneficial for the mechanical performance of the final material. It is also shown that particle morphology can exert a tremendous effect upon the performance of test pieces, indicating that the suspension polymerization step should be carefully controlled when optimization of the bone cement formulation is desired...|$|R
40|$|Tissue {{conditioner}} gels undergo two pro-cesses when {{immersed in}} water. Ethanol is leached {{out into the}} water, and water is sorbed by the polymeric phase of the gel. Materials with high ethanol concentrations show weight loss and shrinkage; those with lower ethanol concentrations show little change. The experimental material in this investigation was found useful for func-tional impression-taking. Previous studies have described the compo-sition and structure of tissue conditioners' and their Theological properties. 2 However, because these materials on a denture are constantly in contact with aqueous solu-tions or water itself, it seemed desirable {{to examine the effects}} of prolonged immersion in water. Materials and Methods Four proprietary materials studied in the previous investigations were examined. The materials were designated A, * B,t C,t D,§ and a fifthFl which has become unavailable in the United Kingdom. Also studied was an experimental material (E). A poly (ethyl <b>methacrylate)</b> polymer <b>powder,</b> # and a liq-uid that contained 92 % butyl phthalyl butyl glycolate and 8 % ethanol were used. In each instance, a specimen was prepared in a strip- 7 cm x 2. 54 cm X about 0. 1 cm-with the use of a mixture of 3 gm polymer powder to 2 ml liquid. Strips were immersed in water 15 minutes after mixing. DIFFUSION OF ETHANOL IN TISSUE CONDI-TIONER GELS. -When a set tissue conditioner Received for publication May 20, 1970...|$|R
40|$|Six {{years ago}} a patient {{suffered}} a severe allergic reaction from Sensitization to methyl methacrylate {{in a mixture of}} materials designed to make artificial nails There was marked erythema, edema, and pain of the eponychial and paronychial tissues with persistent paresthesia of the finger tips. Gradual destruction of the nail plates developed and since no regrowth of the nails resumed in six years, the loss of the finger nails is found to be permanent. GIBBS AND LEIDER recently tabulated and illustrated several nail changes due to vari-ous causes. ’Under “eczematous condi-tions, ” the authors state: “Contact dermatitis from primary irritants and from allergic mechanisms, nummular eczema, and sec-ondarily eczematized conditions in, under and around the nails cause transient distor-tion of nail plates. ”This is true, but {{it must be noted that}} occasionally an allergic contact reaction under and around nails produces prolonged distortion of nail plates, 2 - 3 nd on at least one occasion, here reported, caused permanent anonychia.
