Capsaicin can also be washed off the skin using soap, shampoo, or other detergents.

Capsaicin is soluble in alcohol, which can be used to clean contaminated items.|$|E
25|$|Radioactive {{material}} is found throughout nature. Detectable amounts occur naturally in soil, rocks, water, air, and vegetation, {{from which it}} is inhaled and ingested into the body. In addition to this internal exposure, humans also receive <b>external</b> <b>exposure</b> from radioactive materials that remain outside the body and from cosmic radiation from space. The worldwide average natural dose to humans is about 2.4 millisievert (mSv) per year. This is four times the worldwide average artificial radiation exposure, which in 2008 amounted to about 0.6mSv per year. In some rich countries, like the US and Japan, artificial exposure is, on average, greater than the natural exposure, due to greater access to medical imaging. In Europe, average natural background exposure by country ranges from under 2mSv annually in the United Kingdom to more than 7mSv annually for some groups of people in Finland.|$|E
