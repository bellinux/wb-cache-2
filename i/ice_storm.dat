That day, because of an <b>ice</b> <b>storm</b> in the Nashville area, Williams could not fly, so he hired a college student, Charles Carr, to drive him to the concerts. Carr called the Charleston auditorium from Knoxville to say that Williams would not arrive on time owing to the <b>ice</b> <b>storm</b> and was ordered to drive Williams to Canton, Ohio, for the New Year's Day concert there.|$|E

Rural water relief efforts since 2008 include assistance to areas damaged by hurricanes (Hurricane Gustav, Hurricane Hanna, and Hurricane Ike), tornados (Parkersburg Tornado, Picher Tornado, Dierks Tornado and Magee Tornado), floods, and <b>ice</b> <b>storms</b> (2009 <b>Ice</b> <b>Storms).</b>|$|R
5|$|Much of Quebec's {{population}} {{is served by}} a few 735kV power lines. This contributed to {{the severity of the}} power outage following the North American <b>ice</b> <b>storm</b> of 1998. The extent and duration of this blackout has generated criticism of the transmission system, and there is controversy concerning the use of hydroelectric dams.|$|E
5|$|After {{the power}} outage was over, Hydro-Québec made {{numerous}} upgrades to its system {{in order to}} improve the power grid. Examples include the strengthening of electrical pylons and power poles, and increasing the power supply. This was done to enable the utility to restore power more rapidly {{in the case of a}} massive ice striking Quebec again. Hydro-Québec has stated that it is better-prepared to handle an <b>ice</b> <b>storm</b> with the same magnitude as the one of 1998.|$|E

George Foster Peabody paid to have new soil, a commemorative tablet, and a chain barricade supported by eight granite posts installed around the tree. Despite these efforts, the tree reportedly suffered heavy damage during an <b>ice</b> <b>storm</b> in 1907. Although attempts were made at preservation, rot had already set in, and the tree was permanently weakened.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{the loss}} of power during <b>ice</b> <b>storms</b> has {{indirectly}} caused numerous illnesses and deaths due to unintentional carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. At lower levels, CO poisoning causes symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, fatigue, and headache, but high levels can cause unconsciousness, heart failure, and death. The relatively high incidence of CO poisoning during <b>ice</b> <b>storms</b> occurs due {{to the use of}} alternative methods of heating and cooking during prolonged power outages, common after severe <b>ice</b> <b>storms.</b> Gas generators, charcoal and propane barbecues, and kerosene heaters contribute to CO poisoning when they operate in confined locations. CO is produced when appliances burn fuel without enough oxygen present, such as basements and other indoor locations.|$|R

5|$|In {{the days}} prior to the game, both teams {{had to cope with}} harsh winter weather in the Nashville area. Virginia Tech was forced to move {{practices}} indoors when an <b>ice</b> <b>storm</b> arrived on the day before Christmas. The storm caused travel delays for fans and players alike. Alabama's first practices in Nashville were held without the full team available because many players had been delayed. The harsh weather continued through the day of the game, and Tech was forced to cancel its final outdoor practice before the game. Alabama, meanwhile, drove 45 minutes to Murfreesboro to a practice field that was not covered by ice.|$|E
5|$|With a {{storm track}} {{very close to}} the shore and a {{retreating}} high-pressure area to the northeast, onshore winds allowed temperatures to warm above freezing in eastern and northern New England. A frontal boundary between the warm Atlantic air and a residual wedge of colder air over the interior served as the focus for a severe <b>ice</b> <b>storm</b> in central New England. Thunder and lightning accompanied the precipitation in some areas. By 12:00 UTC on December 27, the attendant upper-level trough matured into a closed cold-core low. The nor'easter continued to drift toward the east-northeast over the next 24 hours.|$|E

40|$|A model {{based on}} the extreme value theory and copula {{functions}} is proposed to assess the probability of potential damages to transmission lines and towers during <b>ice</b> <b>storms.</b> Generalized Pareto distributions of freezing precipitation and wind speed are first derived. Copula functions are then employed to derive the joint probability distribution of ice and wind loads on both transmission lines and towers. Based on the proposed model, probabilities of transmission-line damage and tower collapse can be calculated. The validity and accuracy of the proposed model are verified by comparing the numerical results given by the model with historical data of a real transmission system during two serious <b>ice</b> <b>storms</b> in China. The proposed model will be highly useful for assessing efficacy of power systems emergency controls during <b>ice</b> <b>storms.</b> 1986 - 2012 IEEE...|$|R
5|$|Emergency {{management}} {{officials in}} Fredericton {{stated that it}} could be years before the city fully recovered from the storm. Power restoration in the province reached over 99 percent on July16 with only 750customers still out. However, a thunderstorm that evening revealed the weak nature of the power grid as outages jumped back over 4,000. The following week, Energy Minister Craig Leonard rebutted claims that a public review of NB Power was necessary, despite the longevity and severity of the power outages. New Brunswick's Liberal and Green parties both supported an independent review of the company, while Leonard claimed only an internal review was necessary. The total cost to restore and repair damage to the power grid wrought by the storm amounted to C$8.4million (US$7.5million). This ranked it as the second-costliest event for Nova Scotia Power from a tropical cyclone, only behind Hurricane Juan. New Brunswick Power reported even greater losses from Arthur with damage amounting to C$23million (US$20.1million). This marked the costliest disaster in the company's history, surpassing the December 2013 <b>ice</b> <b>storm.</b> In light of the severe damage, NB Power allocated an extra C$5.1million (US$4.5million) for tree trimming during the 2014-2014 fiscal year.|$|E
5|$|Localized but {{extensive}} {{power outages}} were reported across {{areas that were}} hit by significant amounts of ice. At {{the peak of the}} storm over 300,000 customers lost power across the United States. In the Cincinnati area, 122,000 were without power at one point with 52,000 still blacked out as of Wednesday morning. All had been restored by Tuesday morning. About 7,500 customers in Indiana near the Indianapolis region were still without power on February 15, down from a peak of about 50,000 especially in the Bloomington area. Other states that reported outages included Kentucky (14,000), Maryland (at least 135,000 customers, including 69,000 in Anne Arundel County and 25,000 in Prince George's County, Maryland), New Jersey (36,000), Pennsylvania (10,000 in the Pittsburgh region), Virginia (7,800), and New York (18,000) on Long Island. By 10:00 am Thursday, February 15, about 73,000 homes were without electricity in the Washington DC metropolitan area. Most of those outages were from an <b>ice</b> <b>storm</b> that hit areas from the southern Ohio Valley towards the Atlantic Coast.|$|E
25|$|After this, Lee {{directed}} {{two more}} Hollywood movies: The <b>Ice</b> <b>Storm</b> (1997), a drama set in 1970s suburban America, and Ride with the Devil (1999), an American Civil War drama. Although the critics still highly praised these latter two films, {{they were not}} particularly successful at the box office, {{and for a time}} this interrupted Lee's unbroken popularity– from both general audiences and arthouse aficionados– since his first full-length movie. However, in the late 1990s and 2000s, The <b>Ice</b> <b>Storm</b> had high VHS and DVD sales and rentals and repeated screenings on cable television, which has increased the film's popularity among audiences.|$|E

25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1951, Nashville {{experienced}} the most severe blizzard in the city's history. From Sunday, January 28 to Tuesday, January 30, an <b>ice</b> <b>storm</b> produced an inch of sleet and freezing rain, gridlocking the city and cutting off the power supply to many neighborhoods. On the afternoon of Wednesday, January 31, a blizzard swept through the city with wind gusts in excess of 50 mph and visibility down to zero. Eight inches of snow were recorded, and commute around the city was virtually impossible. On the night of February 2, low temperatures reached -13 degrees Fahrenheit, causing pipelines to burst. Many Nashville residents lacked both electricity and water. Due to {{the severity of the}} <b>ice</b> <b>storm</b> and the blizzard that followed afterwards, this is known as the worst episode of winter weather in Nashville's history. The blizzard of 1951 holds third place for the most snow recorded in Nashville from a single storm system, behind the blizzard of 1892 and Winter Storm Jonas in 2016.|$|E
25|$|The 1991 Halloween {{blizzard}} was {{a powerful}} storm that caused a period of heavy snowfall and ice accumulation, which affected parts of the Upper Midwest of the United States, from October 31 to November 3, 1991.
