40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe U. S. Navy is currently funding {{a program for}} certification of HSLA steels to replace the HY series of high strength steels for structural fabrication. Integral to this program is the certification of welding consumables for use with these steels. The size, distribution and composition of nonmetallic inclusions in HSLA steel weld metal {{has been shown to}} {{play a key role in}} the final strength and toughness of the deposited weld. The purpose of this study was to develop a procedure for analysis of nonmetallic inclusions in HSLA steel multipass weldments utilizing optical microscopy and examination and EDX analysis in a SEM. The results of the study suggest that the mean diameter of inclusions in the final pass of a GMAW weldment in a 2. 0 inch HSLA- 100 plate is larger than the mean diameter of those in the root pass. Additionally, the inclusion material in the final pass contains a greater amount of Si and Ti <b>deoxidation</b> <b>products</b> than that in the root pass. The larger size, composition and complex structure of the inclusions in the final pass suggest that contain <b>deoxidation</b> <b>products</b> from previous welding passes which have been released through remelting and coalesced into larger inclusions[URL] United States Marine Corp...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The flow zone of {{the chip}} {{in contact with the}} tool reaches a high {{temperature}} in cutting. According to chip hardening experiments α−γ transformation may occur in steel, so the tool is in contact with a high-temperature γ phase at high pressure. The microscopic examination of worn surfaces showed that the degradation of the tool is the result of adhesive/abrasive and thermally activated processes, therefore both friction length and temperature must be taken into consideration in the modelling of crater wear. Wear rate can be described by a non-linear autonomous equation. TiN coating, which increases tool life in high speed steel, changes and slows down the wear of the tool. The activation energy of wear can be calculated from the constants of the wear equation determined by cutting experiments. The <b>deoxidation</b> <b>products</b> {{to be found in the}} workpiece in cutting may form a protective layer on the TiN layer that blocks or slows down wear...|$|E
40|$|Heavy steel {{castings}} deoxidized with aluminium are sometimes brittle intercrystalline failed during their service along primary grain boundaries what is initiated by aluminium nitrides and so called conchoidal fractures are formed. The tendency to forming the conchoidal fractures depends in particular on cooling rate (the casting modulus), aluminium and nitrogen contents in steel. During deoxidation, when manufacturing heavy castings, the elements with high affinity to nitrogen, zirconium or titanium, {{are added to}} steel that would decrease nitrogen activity by the bond on stable nitrides. The formation of stable nitrides should reduce the tendency of steel {{to the formation of}} conchoidal fractures. Deoxidation was thermodynamically analyzed at presence of the mentioned elements. For particular conditions a probable course of deoxidation was estimated at test castings. The deoxidation course was checked by microanalysis of <b>deoxidation</b> <b>products</b> (inclusions). For service and experimental castings the anticipated composition of inclusions was compared. It has been proved that in heavy castings with high aluminium contents in steel under studied conditions neither the addition of zirconium nor of titanium nor of rare earth metals will prevent the formation of conchoidal fractures...|$|E
40|$|In Al-Ti-Mg killed steels, the use {{of complex}} <b>deoxidation</b> <b>products,</b> which act as {{heterogeneous}} nucleation sites for fine intragranular ferrite, has been acknowledged as an effective way for grain refinement. In this study, we investigated the interaction between Mn solute atoms and different oxide inclusions (such as MgO, MgTi 2 O 4, MgTiO 3, Ti 2 O 3, Ti 3 O 5, Al 2 O 3, MgAl 2 O 4) experimentally and using first-principles calculations, to identify the oxides that can effectively lead {{to the formation of}} local Mn-depleted zones promoting the nucleation of intragranular ferrite. The results show that MgTi 2 O 4, MgTiO 3 are effective for partition of Mn atoms into oxides, while MgO, Al 2 O 3, MgAl 2 O 4 are ineffective for the formation of local Mn-depleted zones. Furthermore, the calculations show that Mn atoms exist as a simple solute by replacing Mg atoms in MgO, MgTi 2 O 4 and MgTiO 3. Except by forming complex Ti-Mn oxides, such as MnTi 2 O 4 and MnTiO 3, Mn atoms can also exist as a simple solute in Ti 2 O 3 by occupying vacancy positions in their crystals. Ti 3 O 5 oxides cannot absorb Mn atoms by replacing Ti atoms in it, meanwhile, the occupying vacancy pattern is not the main reason for Ti 3 O 5 oxides absorb Mn atoms. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the goal}} is to {{optimize}} the process and to reduce the clogging tendency during the continuous casting process. The focus is on clogging when the refractory base material (RBM) in the SEN is in contact with the liquid steel. It is difficult or impossible to avoid non-metallic inclusions in the liquid steel, but by a selection of a good RBM in the SEN clogging can be reduced.   Different process steps were evaluated during the casting process {{in order to reduce the}} clogging tendency. First, the preheating of the SEN was studied. The results showed that the SEN can be decarburized during the preheating process. In addition, decarburization of SEN causes a larger risk for clogging. Two types of plasma coatings were implemented to protect the RBM, to prevent reactions with the RBM, and to reduce the clogging tendency. Calcium titanate (CaTiO 3) mixed with yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) plasma coatings were tested in laboratory and pilot plant trials, for casting of aluminium-killed low-carbon steels. For casting of cerium alloyed stainless steels, YSZ plasma coatings were tested in laboratory, pilot plant and industrial trials. The results showed that the clogging tendency was reduced when implementing both coating materials.   It is also of importance to produce clean steel in order to reduce clogging. Therefore, the steel cleanliness in the tundish was studied experimentally. The result showed that inclusions originated from the slag, <b>deoxidation</b> <b>products</b> and tundish refractory and that they were present in the tundish as well as in the final steel product.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain a good {{performance}} and predict the properties of alloys, {{it is necessary to}} control the contents of alloying elements and to evaluate a largest inclusion in the product. Thus, improved techniques for both control of alloy elements and evaluation of the large inclusion in products will enable us to provide better qualities of the final products. In the case of one Ni alloy, (NW 2201, > 99 mass%Ni), the precise control technique of Mg content is important to obtain a good hot-workability. Hereby, the slag/metal reaction experiments in a laboratory have been carried out at 1873 K, so that the equilibrium Mg content and kinetic behavior can be understood. More addition of Al in the melt as well as higher CaO/Al 2 O 3 value of slag resulted in higher amount of Mg content in Ni. For the same conditions of Al content and slag composition, the mass transfer coefficient of Mg in molten Ni was determined as 0. 0175 cm/s. By applying several countermeasures regarding the equilibrium and kinetic process to the plant trials, the value of the standard deviation for the Mg content in an alloy was decreased till 0. 003 from 0. 007 mass%. The size measurements of largest inclusions in the various alloys (an Fe- 10 mass%Ni alloy, 17 CrMo 4 of low-C steel and 304 stainless steel) were carried out by using statistics of extreme values (SEV). In order to improve the prediction accuracy of this method, three dimensional (3 D) observations were applied after electrolytic extraction. In addition, the relationship of extreme value distribution (EVD) in the different stages of the production processes was studied. This was done to predict the largest inclusion in the products at an early stage of the process. A comparison of EVDs for single Al 2 O 3 inclusion particles obtained by 2 D and 3 D observations has clarified that 3 D observations result in more accurate EVD because of the absence of pores. Also, it was found that EVD of clusters were larger than that of single particles. In addition, when applying SEV to sulfide inclusions with various morphologies, especially for elongated sulfides, the real maximum sizes of them were able to be measured by 3 D observations. Geometrical considerations of these particles clarified the possibility of an appearance of the real maximum inclusion sizes on a cross section to be low. The EVDs of <b>deoxidation</b> <b>products</b> in 304 stainless steel showed good agreement between the molten steel and slab samples of the same heat. Furthermore, the EVD of fractured inclusion lengths in the rolled steel were estimated from the initial sizes of undeformed inclusions which were equivalent with fragmented inclusions. On the other hand, from the viewpoint of inclusion width, EVD obtained from perpendicular cross section of strips was found to be useful to predict the largest inclusion in the final product with less time consumption compared to a slab sample. In summary, it can be concluded that the improvement of the techniques by this study has enabled to precisely control of alloy compositions as well as to evaluate the largest inclusion size in them more accurately and at an earlier stage of the production process.

40|$|During the {{production}} of steel the oxide inclusion content partly depends on {{the reaction of the}} melt with the furnace lining, the ladle lining and the pouring system. The refractory material may be eroded by the molten steel and slag as well as corroded through chemical reactions with the slag and molten steel and the <b>deoxidation</b> <b>products.</b> In this report the effects of revolution speed, temperature and steel composition on the rate of dissolution of commercial MgO-C refractory samples into Al-deoxidised molten steel and CaOAl 2 O 3 - SiO 2 -MgO slag were examined by the rotating cylinder method. The study also includes tests with slag were doloma refractory samples are examined by the same method. Cylinders of MgO-C refractory material were immersed in to steel that was deoxidised by adding metallic aluminium. This was carried out in the temperature range of 1873 to 1973 C° and at rotational speeds of 100 to 800 rpm for different holding times. The experimental results show that the rate of dissolution of MgO-C refractory materials increased with the temperature, rotational speed and immersion time. This supports the assumption that the diffusion of magnesium through the slag boundary layer formed around the refractory samples would be the rate-determining step. Mass transfer coefficients calculated on the basis of experimental results are in good agreement with earlier published results for pure ceramics. A formation of a thin oxide layer at the interface was found. It is due the reaction between magnesium vapour and the CO generated by the reaction MgO and C in the refractory walls. The oxide inclusions formed in the steel have been shown to mainly consist of MgO, Al 2 O 3 and a mixture of them. The rate of dissolution of solid MgO-C into liquid CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -MgO slag at different temperatures was studied under conditions of forced convection by rotating cylindrical refractory specimens in a stationary crucible containing the molten slag similar to the MgO-C refractory/steel experiments. The corrosion rate was calculated from the change in diameter of the cylindrical specimens. The specimens were rotated for 15 to 120 minutes at speeds of 100 to 400 rpm in the molten slag. The rate of corrosion increased with temperature and with rotating speed of the rod and decreased when the slag was nearly saturated with MgO. The experimental results confirm the assumption that the diffusion of magnesium oxide through the slag phase boundary layer controls the corrosion process. The corrosion mechanism seems to be the dissolution of elements in the refractory materials into the slag, followed by penetration into the pores and grain boundaries. Finally, grains are loosened from the refractory into the slag. The investigation of doloma and doloma-carbon showed that the dissolution of magnesia into the slag was determining the corrosion rate. As for the other experiments, steel/MgO-C refractory and slag/MgO-C refractory, the corrosion rate was calculated from the change in diameter of the cylindrical specimens. The specimens were rotated for 15 to 120 minutes at speeds of 100 to 400 rpm in the molten slag. The results from the study showed that refractory materials that were impregnated with carbon had a much better slag resistance than the refractory that contained no carbon. This is due to the higher wetting angle between carbon and slag. Corrosion of MgO-C refractories in different gas atmospheres consisting of air, Ar, CO or Ar/CO was also studied. Experiments were carried out in the temperature range 1173 K to 1773 K and for holding times between 2 to 120 min. The reaction rate of the MgO-C material was determined from measurements of the weight loss of the samples. The results showed that the refractory weight loss increased with an increased temperature or an increased holding time. The thermodynamic conditions and the experimental results show that magnesium gas and carbon monoxide gas should form during ladle refining of steel when the refractory material consists of MgO-C.
