25|$|In 1905, Geronimo {{agreed to}} tell his story to S. M. Barrett, Superintendent of Education in Lawton, Oklahoma. Barrett had to appeal to President Roosevelt to gain {{permission}} to publish the book. Geronimo came to <b>each</b> <b>interview</b> knowing exactly what he wanted to say. He refused to answer questions or alter his narrative. Barrett did not seem to take many liberties with Geronimo's story as translated by Asa Daklugie. Frederick Turner re-edited this autobiography by removing some of Barrett's footnotes and writing an introduction for the non-Apache readers. Turner notes the book is in the style of an Apache reciting part of his oral history.|$|E
500|$|Jennifer Lopez: Feelin' So Good {{opens with}} an intertitle that {{features}} a behind-the-scenes look at Lopez during the artwork shoot for On the 6, artist's proof of said photoshoot and brief clips of the music videos to the album's five singles. In the second chapter, [...] "Why Risk a Music Career?", Lopez is interviewed by her sister Lynda Lopez, who oversees <b>each</b> <b>interview</b> segment, {{about the risks of}} starting a music career after having an already thriving movie career. Critics believed that she was only launching a music career with an intent to expand her brand, while Lopez felt as if it was simply the [...] "next natural step" [...] in her career. Lopez's manager Benny Medina further discusses this, labeling her as the [...] "ultimate" [...] triple threat – [...] "the actor, singer and dancer". Lopez then confers, in the chapter [...] "Press Tours / Promotions", about the extensive promotional schedule she was on to promote the album. She examines the differences in promoting an album and a film, stating that promoting an album is more [...] "personal" [...] as it is something that is [...] "closer to your heart" [...] and something she [...] "really believes in". According to Lopez, {{by the end of the}} promotional tour for the album she [...] "lost" [...] her voice from the amount of interviews she had. Following this, Lopez's performance of the Darkchild remix of [...] "If You Had My Love" [...] at the 1999 VH1 Fashion Awards is shown.|$|E

Dick, the groom, had returned from his errand, and Tom Wychecombe, the intended heir of the baronet, was also there, in mourning for his reputed father, the judge.

There had been several meetings between himself and his namesake, and <b>each</b> <b>interview</b> was becoming less amicable than the preceding, for a reason that was sufficiently known to the parties.

Still, the feelings that were uppermost did not prevent the latter from speaking in an apparently friendly manner.|$|E

60|$|They were a most mad ten days, but Kim enjoyed himself {{too much}} {{to reflect on their}} craziness. In the morning they played the Jewel Game--{{sometimes}} with veritable stones, sometimes with piles of swords and daggers, sometimes with photo-graphs of natives. Through the afternoons he and the Hindu boy would mount guard in the shop, sitting dumb behind a carpet-bale or a screen and watching Mr Lurgan's many and very curious visitors. There were small Rajahs, escorts coughing in the veranda, who came to buy curiosities--such as phonographs and mechanical toys. There were ladies in search of necklaces, and men, it seemed to Kim--but his mind may have been vitiated by early training--in search of the ladies; natives from independent and feudatory Courts whose ostensible business was the repair of broken necklaces--rivers of light poured out upon the table--but whose true end seemed to be to raise money for angry Maharanees or young Rajahs. There were Babus to whom Lurgan Sahib talked with austerity and authority, {{but at the end of}} <b>each</b> <b>interview</b> he gave them money in coined silver and currency notes. There were occasional gatherings of long-coated theatrical natives who discussed metaphysics in English and Bengali, to Mr Lurgan's great edification. He was always interested in religions. At the end of the day, Kim and the Hindu boy--whose name varied at Lurgan's pleasure--were expected to give a detailed account of all that they had seen and heard--their view of each man's character, as shown in his face, talk, and manner, and their notions of his real errand. After dinner, Lurgan Sahib's fancy turned more to what might be called dressing-up, in which game he took a most informing interest. He could paint faces to a marvel; with a brush-dab here and a line there changing them past recognition. The shop was full of all manner of dresses and turbans, and Kim was apparelled variously as a young Mohammedan of good family, an oilman, and once--which was a joyous evening--as the son of an Oudh landholder in the fullest of full dress. Lurgan Sahib had a hawk's eye to detect the least flaw in the make-up; and lying on a worn teak-wood couch, would explain by the half-hour together how such and such a caste talked, or walked, or coughed, or spat, or sneezed, and, since 'hows' matter little in this world, the 'why' of everything. The Hindu child played this game clumsily. That little mind, keen as an icicle where tally of jewels was concerned, could not temper itself to enter another's soul; but a demon in Kim woke up and sang with joy as he put on the changing dresses, and changed speech and gesture therewith.|$|E
