5|$|Morrow's early {{education}} {{was in the}} public schools of Somerset. At age 14, he entered preparatory school at St. Mary's College near Lebanon, Kentucky. He continued there throughout 1891 and 1892. From there, he enrolled at Cumberland College (now the University of the Cumberlands) in Williamsburg, Kentucky, and distinguished himself in the debating society. He was also interested in sports, playing halfback on the football team and left <b>field</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> baseball team.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July 1962 the Chapter General of the Holy Ghost Fathers elected Lefebvre as the Superior General. Lefebvre {{was widely}} {{respected}} for {{his experience in}} the mission <b>field.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, certain progressive members of his congregation, particularly in France, considered his administrative style authoritarian and desired radical reforms. On 7 August 1962 Lefebvre was given the titular archiepiscopal see of Synnada in Phrygia.|$|E

5|$|The {{magnetic}} <b>field</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{surface of}} Epsilon Eridani causes {{variations in the}} hydrodynamic behaviour of the photosphere. This results in greater jitter during measurements of its radial velocity. Variations of −1 were measured over a 20year period, which {{is much higher than}} the measurement uncertainty of −1. This makes interpretation of periodicities in the radial velocity of Epsilon Eridani, such as those caused by an orbiting planet, more difficult.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{returned}} Tech's kickoff to the Texas 21-yard line, and the Longhorns' offense {{took the}} <b>field.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> first play, Brown completed a 13-yard pass to Adams, who earned {{a first down}} at the 34-yard line. Mitchell gained four yards on a running play, then Texas was penalized for having an ineligible player downfield. On the play after the penalty, Texas was penalized for an illegal formation, negating a completed pass for a first down. The Longhorns then faced a third down and 11, but Brown's third-down pass was knocked down and the Longhorns punted to end their final possession of the first half.|$|E

5|$|After the Virginia Tech kickoff {{and a short}} return, Miami {{began the}} first drive of the game at its 32-yard line. The game's first play was an {{incomplete}} pass from Miami quarterback Jim Kelly. After a one-yard rush, Kelly completed his first pass of the game, an 18-yard toss that drove Miami to the Tech 49-yard line and gave the Hurricanes a first down. Miami then committed a 15-yard penalty, pushing the Hurricanes back into {{their side of the}} <b>field.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> second play after the penalty, Kelly completed a 29-yard pass that gave Miami a first down. The Hurricanes were further aided by a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty against Virginia Tech, giving Miami a first down at the Tech 20-yard line. From there, it took Miami just three plays to score a touchdown, the final play being a 15-yard pass from Kelly to Larry Brodsky. With 12:37 remaining in the quarter, Miami took a 70 lead.|$|E
5|$|All {{the while}} Hancock was posted in New York, {{he did his}} best to keep his {{political}} ambitions alive. He received some votes at the Democrats' 1876 convention, but was never a serious contender as New York governor Samuel J. Tilden swept the <b>field</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second ballot. The Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes, won the election, and Hancock refocused his ambition on 1880. The electoral crisis of 1876 and the subsequent end to Reconstruction in 1877 convinced many observers that the election of 1880 would give the Democrats their best chance at victory in a generation.|$|E

Initially the club played on Plumstead Common, but soon sought alternative homes, firstly the Sportsman Ground in Plumstead {{before moving to the}} adjacent Manor Ground in 1888. Unhappy with the Manor Ground's poor facilities, the club moved to the nearby Invicta Ground in 1890, before returning to the Manor Ground three years later as the Invicta Ground's rent proved too expensive.|$|E

5|$|Earlier in {{the season}} Commissioner Bud Selig {{expressed}} interest in scheduling a World Series game during daylight hours instead of the evening. The starting times were ultimately moved before 8p.m. ET {{for the first time}} in 30 years, but no day games were played. The Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL) played across the street from Citizens Bank Park at Lincoln Financial <b>Field</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> day of Game4. The NFL moved that game's kickoff time to 1p.m. to avoid it ending too close to the start of Game4. Similarly, Game5 was played at Citizens Bank Park on the same day as the Philadelphia Flyers hosted the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL) at the Wachovia Center. The opening faceoff of the hockey game was scheduled for 7p.m. but the NHL moved it to 5p.m. to avoid conflict.|$|E

Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) experiences déjà vu and walks into a <b>field</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> compound, where he finds a trapdoor.

5|$|In one of {{the worst}} {{disasters}} on the mountain in over thirty years, six climbers—two guides, and four clients—last heard from on May28, 2014, were presumed dead on May31, 2014, when low-flying search helicopters pinged the signals from the avalanche beacons worn by the climbers. Officials concluded that there was no possible chance of survival after the climbers fell 3,300 feet (1,000 m) while attempting or returning from the summit via the Liberty Ridge climbing route. Searchers found tents and clothes along with rock and ice strewn across a debris <b>field</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Carbon Glacier at , possible evidence for a slide or avalanche in the vicinity where the team went missing, though the exact cause of the accident is unknown. The bodies of three of the guest climbers were spotted on August7, 2014, during a training flight and subsequently recovered on August19, 2014. The bodies of the fourth guest climber and two guides have not been located.|$|E

5|$|North Carolina's post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Virginia Tech 25-yard line, and the Hokies prepared for their second possession of the game. Parker was stopped for no gain on a run attempt, and another attempt on the next play was stopped for a loss of a yard. Facing third down, Clark attempted to scramble for the first down, but was stopped after a gain of six yards. Having gone three and out, the Hokies punted again. The kick was downed at the 36-yard line, and North Carolina's offense returned for its second possession of the game. On the first play of the drive, Linton gained two yards on a run up {{the middle of the}} <b>field.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> next play, Keldorf completed a 62-yard pass to Octavus Barnes, who had broken free of the Virginia Tech defense.

5|$|On the Seminoles' first {{offensive}} {{play of the}} drive, {{they attempted}} a flea flicker pass, which was caught by Warrick at the Virginia Tech 33-yard line for a 33-yard gain.

This was followed immediately by Tech's second sack, which pushed Weinke back into the Seminoles' side of the <b>field.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> third play of the Seminole drive, Weinke attempted to scramble for yardage, but was stopped short of the needed mark. Florida State's punt was downed at the Virginia Tech one-yard line, which was where the Tech offense began work. Florida State's defense prevented the Hokies from gaining a first down, and Tech again had to punt from its end zone.|$|E

With no other option, a member of the Sun Bowl Committee—who happened to be an alumnus of Virginia Tech—suggested inviting the Hokies to play against Cincinnati, which had already accepted an invitation.|$|E
5|$|The Mission {{site had}} been under study for {{conservation}} since 2002.
