Confirmation of acid-fast survivors of pasteurization as viable M. paratuberculosis cells was achieved by subculture on HEYM to indicate viability coupled with PCR using M. paratuberculosis-specific 1 S 900 primers. When milk was initially inoculated with 10 (6) to 10 (7) CFU of M. paratuberculosis per ml, M. paratuberculosis cells were isolated from 27 of 28 (96 %) and 29 of 34 (85 %) pasteurized milk samples heat treated by the holder and HTST methods, respectively.

At least one marker was detected in 20 / 24 (83 %) milk samples. Both markers were identified in milk of HBeAg-positive mothers, and most mothers with anti-HBe in blood had at least one HBV marker.

Methods: The samples of donated fresh human milk were studied before and after each process (<b>Holder</b> <b>pasteurization,</b> freezing and thawing and feeding method) until their delivery to newborn infants. Fifty-seven raw human milk samples were analyzed in the ???rst step (pasteurization) and 228 in the offer step. Repeated measurements of protein, fat and lactose amounts were made in samples of human milk using an Infrared analyzer. The in???uence of repeated processes on the mean concentration of macronutrients in donor human milk was analyzed by repeated measurements ANOVA, using R statistical package. Results: The most variable macronutrient concentration in the analyzed samples was fat (reduction of 59 %). There was a signi???cant reduction of fat and protein mean concentrations following pasteurization (5. 5 and 3. 9 %, respectively). The speed at which the milk was thawed didn't cause a signi???cant variation in the macronutrients concentrations. However, the continuous infusion delivery signi???cantly reduced the fat concentration.

As The Committee on Nutrition of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) states, specific guidelines for Human Milk Banks (HMB) are needed to guarantee the best possible compromise between microbiological safety and nutritional/biological quality of human milk (HM). Currently, <b>Holder</b> <b>pasteurization</b> (HoP: pasteurization process at 62. 5 - 63 °C for 30 minutes) is recommended by all international guidelines: this method inactivates bacterial and viral pathogens but it also affects some nutritional and biological properties of human milk.

High Pressure Processing (HPP) is a non- thermal process used in food industries: this technology inactivates pathogenic microorganisms by applying hydrostatic high pressure, however further researches are required before applying this technology in milk banking. Ultraviolet-C irradiation (UV-C) is another non-thermal method capable of reducing vegetative bacteria in human milk and it also seems to preserve higher levels of immunological proteins than HoP. High-temperature short-time pasteurization (HTST: flash pasteurization, 72 °C for 5 - 15 seconds) currently is available only at industrial level, but it could represent an alternative to HoP seeming to maintain the protein profile and some of the key active components of DHM.

40|$|Background: <b>Holder</b> <b>pasteurization</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to modify human milk composition and structure by inactivating bile salt–stimulated lipase (BSSL) and partially denaturing some of its proteins, potentially affecting its subsequent digestion. Objective: We sought to determine the impact of human milk pasteurizationon gastric digestion (particularly for proteins and lipids) in preterm infants who were fed their mothers’ own milk either raw or pasteurized. Design: In a randomized controlled trial, 12 hospitalized tube-fed preterm infants were their own control group in comparing the gastric digestion of raw human milk (RHM) with pasteurized human milk (PHM). Over a 6 -d sequence, gastric aspirates were collected 2 times/d before and after RHM or PHM ingestion. The impact of milk pasteurization digestive kinetics and disintegration was tested {{with the use of a}} general linear mixed model. Results: Despite inactivating BSSL, instantaneous lipolysis was not affected by pasteurization (mean 6 SD at 90 min: 12. 6 % 6 4. 7 %; P. 0. 05). Lipolysis occurred in milk before digestion and was higher for PHM than for RHM (mean 6 SD: 3. 2 % 6 0. 6 % and 2. 2 % 6 0. 8 %, respectively; P, 0. 001). Pasteurization enhanced the proteolysis of lactoferrin (P, 0. 01) and reduced that of a-lactalbumin (only at 90 min) (P, 0. 05). Strong emulsion destabilization was observed, with smaller aggregates and a higher specific surface for PHM (P, 0. 05). Pasteurization did not affect gastric emptying (w 30 -min half time) or pH (mean 6 SD: 4. 4 6 0. 8) at 90 min. Conclusions: Overall, pasteurization had no impact on the gastric digestion of lipids and some proteins from human milk but did affect lactoferrin and a-lactalbumin proteolysis and emulsion disintegration. Freeze-thawing and pasteurization increased the milk lipolysis before digestion but did not affect gastric lipolysis. Possible consequences on intestinal digestion and associated nutritional outcomes were not considered in this study. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials. gov as NCT 02112331...|$|E
40|$|Ensuring {{adequate}} {{growth of}} preterm newborns remains a challenge. When breastfeeding is not possible, pasteurized human milk (PHM) from milk banks is preferentially administered to hospitalized newborns. <b>Holder</b> <b>pasteurization</b> (62. 5 °; 30 min) is applied for sanitary reasons but may reduce fat absorption through the inactivation of milk endogenous lipases. It {{has been suggested}} that homogenization of Holder-pasteurized human milk (PHM) could improve fat absorption and weight gain. The objective of the present work was to determine the impact of pasteurization and homogenization on gastric digestion in preterm infants. In a randomized controlled trial (NCT 02112331), hospitalized tube-fed preterm infants were their own control to compare the gastric digestion of either i) raw (RHM) and pasteurized human milk (PHM), or ii) pasteurized (PHM) and homogenized PHM (PHHM). Over a six-day sequence, gastric aspirates were collected twice a day, before and 35, 60 or 90 min after the start of milk ingestion. The impact of homogenization on PHM digestive kinetics, lipolytic activity and disintegration was monitored. Pasteurization and homogenization affected milk initial structure, with the formation of protein aggregates at the interface of the milk fat globules in PHM and a six-fold increase of the specific surface (P< 0. 01) of lipid droplets in PHHM. Treatments also affected gastric aggregation. Despite inactivation of bile salt stimulated lipase, pasteurization did not impact gastric lipolysis level averaging 12. 6 ± 4. 7 % at 90 min. Conversely, homogenization increased this level (P< 0. 01). Homogenization also reduced meal emptying rate (P< 0. 001). Pre-lipolysis occurred prior to pasteurization in all milks ranging between 2. 2 - 4. 0 %. The global gastric lipolytic activity detected in fasted state averaged 17. 5 ± 2. 9 U/mL/kg at pH 4. 5. Postprandial lipolytic activity increased with time and was higher after administration of RHM compared to PHM (n= 5) whereas it was not different after administration of PHM vs. PHHM (n= 4). Overall, in vivo data gathered here are crucial for a better understanding of milk neonatal digestion and help supporting the nutritional management of preterm infants...|$|E
40|$|Donor {{human milk}} is pasteurized {{to prevent the}} {{potential}} risk of the transmission of pathogens to preterm infants. Currently, <b>Holder</b> <b>pasteurization</b> (human milk held at 62 · 5 °C for 30 min) is used in most human milk banks, but has the disadvantage that it results in excessive inactivation of important bioactive components. Power-ultrasound (20 - 100 kHz) is an emerging technology {{for the preservation of}} foods and could be an alternative method for the treatment of human milk. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of different ultrasound settings on the elimination of Escherichia coli and the retention of bile salt stimulated lipase (BSSL) activity. Ultrasonication with a constant power decreased Esch. coli viability exponentially over time until the processing temperature increased to sub-pasteurization level to between 51 · 4 and 58 · 5 °C, then a log 10 1 · 3 decrease was observed (P< 0 · 05). BSSL activity decreased to 91 % until a temperature of 51 · 4 °C and then it decreased to 8 % between 51 · 4 and 64 · 9 °C. Ultrasonication with a constant energy and various power and exposure times showed the highest temperature (53 · 7 °C) when treated with the longest exposure time and lowest ultrasound-power (276 s at 3 · 62 W) compared with 37 · 6 °C for 39 s at 25 · 64 W. The findings predict that the viability of Esch. coli could be reduced by log 10 5 with a minimal loss of activity of BSSL by applying 13 · 8 kJ of energy in 12 ml of human milk using high ultrasound power over a short exposure time to ensure that the temperature remains below the critical level for protein denaturation. Alternatively, the use of lower power settings such as the 26 W used in the present studies would require a cooling system to ensure the human milk BSSL was protected against temperature denaturatio...|$|E
40|$|Objectives and study: Human milk is {{the ideal}} food for {{neonatal}} nutrition and optimal growth. When the mother's own milk is unavailable or limited, pasteurized human milk from milk banks ispreferentially administered instead of infant formula, especially for preterm hospitalized neonates. <b>Holder</b> <b>pasteurization</b> (62. 5 °C, 30 min) is applied for sanitary reasons but alters human milkcomponents such as enzymes and immunoglobulins. In vitro studies have also shown thatpasteurization of human milk impacts its hydrolysis and disintegration in term newborns (De Oliveiraet al., 2016). Our study aimed at investigating the impact of pasteurization of human milk on itsgastric digestion in preterm infants. -Methods: In vivo study was conducted at Rennes Hospital on preterm infants (n= 12) fed by afeeding nasogastric tube each three hours (NCT 02112331). Over a six-day sequence, gastric aspirateswere collected twice a day, before and after administration of raw or pasteurized human milk. Samples were collected at 35, 60 or 90 min after meal ingestion. Gastric volume and pH weremeasured. Structural changes of the digesta were evaluated by confocal microscopy and laser lightscattering. In digesta, residual intact proteins left were followed by gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) submitted to densitometry, and lipolysis degree was evaluated by gas and thin layer chromatographyfitted to flame ionization detector. -Results: On average (±SD), infants were 27. 5 ± 12. 3 days old at {{the first day of}} the study. Birthweight was 1. 4 ± 0. 3 kg and gestational age 29. 6 ± 1. 0 weeks. Digestive kinetics presented high interand intra-individual variabilities. Regarding proteins, results showed a rapid disappearance of intactcaseins and lactoferrin, but a resistance of alpha-lactalbumin. The contribution of meal gastricemptying or hydrolysis in protein disappearance depended on the protein. Some pre-lipolysis wasdetermined in milk before digestion and it was in overall significantly lower in pasteurized than inraw milk, likely due to the heat-denaturation of endogenous lipases. During gastric digestion thekinetics of lipolysis were not affected by pasteurization (p > 0. 05). The lipolysis degree ranged from 6 to 20 % at 90 min. This relatively limited extent of gastric lipolysis was observed for both raw andpasteurized human milk, and was illustrated by the microscopic observations: some native milk fatglobule structure (hydrophobic core enveloped by an amphiphilic membrane) persisted through thegastric digestion for both raw and pasteurized human milk. Regarding the structure, pasteurizationled to heat-induced protein aggregates in the soluble phase and at the interface of the human milkfat globule membrane, and also impacted the protein aggregation and emulsion disintegrationduring gastric digestion. -Conclusion: This study represents a unique and important dataset on the behavior of pasteurizedversus raw human milk. The gastric digestion is a key step which can further modulate nutrientabsorption and infant nutrition. Digestive hydrolysis may also impact on gut microbiota, a majorcontributor to the development of the intestinal and systemic immune systems in the neonatalperiod. Physiologic and metabolic consequences remain to be investigated...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{evidence}} {{favors the}} use of human milk for the feeding of preterm infants based on its many beneficial effects, including on infectious-related outcomes. However, contaminated human milk can act as the vehicle of transmission {{for a number of}} infections. Pasteurization inactivatesmost bacteria and viruses in the milk but likewise affects the immunological and nutritional quality of the milk. As a result of these effects,we hypothesized that short term infection-related benefits of human milk feeding for very low-birth-weight infants are decreased by the processof pasteurization. Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate the impact of typeof enteral feeding, comparing raw and pasteurized mother´s own milk andformula milk, on the colonization of the intestinal microbiota, which {{plays an important role in}} the protection against invasive infections. Chapter 1, the introduction of this thesis, gives an overview of the benefits of human milk in reduction of infection-related morbidity in preterm infants, the intestinal microflora and its relationto infection, the hazards of microbial contamination and quality control of expressed maternal milk and the effects of pasteurization. Furthermore, the outline and aims of the thesis are described. In chapter 2, we document the diversity in current practices for {{the use of}} human milk in neonatal intensive care units in Belgium and Luxembourg, especially regarding storage and processing procedures. In chapter 3, we focus on clinical management issues on the use of expressed mother´s own milk in the neonatal intensive care unit and apply the principles of hazard analysis and critical control points on the handling of expressed mother´s own milk. In chapter 4, the first randomized controlled trial on pasteurization of mother´s own milk for very low-birth-weight infants shows that pasteurization does not significantly reduce therisk of serious infectious morbidity. On the contrary, there is a trendtowards a lower incidence of bloodstream infections in infants assignedto receive raw, untreated expressed milk. Intestinal colonization patterns of staphylococci, the most frequent causative microorganism of nosocomial sepsis, is not associated with the type of enteral feeding, as wasdescribed in chapter 5. In addition, we found that, in most patients exhibiting a bloodstream infection, intestinal colonization retrieves a predominant strain that is different from the one recovered from the blood. We speculate that, in case of staphyolococcal invasive infection, an endogenous portal of entry plays a minor role. The in vitro effects of <b>Holder</b> <b>pasteurization</b> on the immunological quality of maternal milk are further described in chapter 6. In chapter 6 a, we found a low mannose binding lectin activity in human milk, without difference between pasteurized and non-pasteurized milk. On the other hand, pasteurization significantly reduces the soluble CD 14 concentration in expressed human milk. In chapter 6 b, we focused on the effect of pasteurization on the antibacterial properties of human milk. In milk samples inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli, growth inhibition is significantly lower in the pasteurized milk compared to raw milk. The results of this thesis suggest that pasteurization of mother´s own milk is not an effective strategy to minimise the risk of serious infectious morbidity; minimizing exogenous bacterial contamination of expressed milk, using the HACCP approach, has priority. status: publishe...|$|E
