50|$|By 1939 Kirlian had {{acquired}} a reputation as the best local resource for repairing electrical equipment, and was regularly called upon to fix the apparatus of scientists and laboratories in the area. In that year, he happened to witness a demonstration of a high-frequency d'Arsonval <b>electrotherapy</b> <b>device.</b> He noticed {{that there was a}} small flash of light between the machine's electrodes and the patient's skin, and wondered if {{he would be able to}} photograph it. (Kirlian was not the first person to witness this phenomenon, though the urge to photograph and investigate it seems to have been original with him.) Experimenting with similar equipment, he replaced glass electrodes with metal substitutes to take photographs in visible light; at the price of a severe electrical burn, he was able to take an unusual and striking photograph of an apparent energy discharge around his own hand and of others as well.|$|R
40|$|Study Design: Randomized, double-blind, {{controlled}} {{trial with}} completion of therapy, at 3 months and 6 months follow-up. Objective: To determine {{the effectiveness of}} an <b>electrotherapy</b> <b>device</b> (Physicalm??) to improve pain and function in patients with chronic nonspecific neck pain. Background: Neck disorders are common, disabling, and costly. The prevalence is higher with older age and among females. Electrotherapy is widely used to treat neck and other musculoskeletal pain: There is some evidence supporting its effectiveness for neck pain relief, but the few published data have been limited or contradictory. Solid scientific support has only been obtained for physical exercise, either alone or combined with manual techniques. Material and methods: Fifty-seven patients with chronic nonspecific neck pain and aged between 18 and 65 years were randomly allocated to undergo real or simulated Physicalm?? treatment for 15 sessions during a 3 -week period. Both treatments were accompanied by an exercise program taught by a physiotherapist. Primary outcome measures were pain intensity (10 -cm Visual Analog Scale [VAS] 10 cm) and neck disability (Neck Disability Index [NDI] and Northwick Park neck pain Questionnaire [NPQ]). Secondary outcome measures included the outcome perceived by the patients, their satisfaction with the treatment, and therapeutic co-interventions during the treatment. Measurements were taken at baseline, {{at the end of}} treatment, and at 3 months and 6 months post-treatment. Results: Mean initial pain intensity in all participants was 5. 52 cm. All pain intensity and neck disability values were lower in patients undergoing treatment with active Physicalm?? than in those treated with inactive Physicalm??, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. There was no significant interaction in the ANOVA analysis. Conclusion: Physicalm?? therapy was not effective to relieve pain or improve function in patients with chronic non-specific neck pain at any time point during the 6 -month follow-up...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the back pain and {{possible}} ways of treatment of the pain it inflicts with distance elektrotherapy. Specifically, the impacts of the device VAS - 07 are discussed. The aforementioned device combines the effects of treatment based on the gate control theory of pain and phototheraphy The aim of this thesis is to map out the effects this therapy has on the pain of patients suffering from this disease. Nowadays, back pain is a disease affecting {{a large amount of}} patients and its etiology includes numerous structural and functional defects. Back pain befalls people from various social backgrounds and of all ages. Due to the rising incidence, this disease is becoming {{one of the most common}} reasons why people visit physiotherapeutical clinics. This is in turn caused by the lifestyle associated with our modern civilisation. There are many ways of dealing with this disease. Among frequently used techniques are kinesiotherapy, manipulation therapy, soft techniques, possitive termotherapy and different kinds of electrotherapy. One of the possible treatments is the distance <b>electrotherapy,</b> using the <b>device</b> VAS - 07. The theoretical part contains the fundamental information about the disease and the selected way of tretment. Namely, the anatomy and kinesiology of the spine, pain and its varieties, back pain, as well as distance <b>electrotherapy</b> and the <b>device</b> VAS - 07 itself are scrutinized. A qualitative research was carried out for the practical part of the thesis. The research is based on medical history of the patinets, kinesiology analyses of the patients and dialogs between each patient and the author. Both static and dynamic examinations are included in the kinesiology analyses. The research group consisted of four respondents of both sexes ranging between 40 and 55 years of age. All participants provided a written consent to the use of the amassed data in this thesis under the condition that they remain anonymous. The research was conducted in a rehabilitation clinic at the health center in Blatn√°. The results were mostly coincident among the participants. The employment of the therapy resulted in decrease of the pain level among all participants. Some of the participants further mentioned a change of the quality of the pain. There were also differences between the entrance and final examinations. Changes of posture were detected in the aspect examinations too. Most of the changes occurred in areas where patients experienced the pain or areas in close proximity. Adittionaly, changes were found in the mobility of spine segments and the mobility of the whole spine as well. After decerease in pain levels, the results of tests evaluating the mobility of the spine improved among all respondents. The inspected methods of treatment also caused the relaxation of soft tissue, which were previously less relaxed. This fact has elucidated when examined by the Kiblesr¬¥s skinfold. Comparing the final kinesiology examinations to the initial one, an adjustment of hypertonic muscles was also detected...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose. The {{safe use}} of {{therapeutic}} diathermy requires practices and procedures that ensure compliance to professional guidelines and clinical evidence. Inappropriate use may expose physiotherapists {{and other people}} in the vicinity of operating diathermy devices to stray radiofrequency electromagnetic fields, which can be a source of risk and may lead to adverse health effects. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate practices and procedures for therapeutic diathermy from a health and safety perspective. Method. A cross-sectional research design was used, this included a postal survey using a self-administered questionnaire and semi-structured observational visits to 46 physiotherapy departments in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals located in the south-east and south-west of England, including Greater London. Results. Microwave diathermy was not available in the departments surveyed. Pulsed shortwave diathermy was available and was used more commonly than continuous shortwave diathermy. There were metallic objects in treatment cubicles used for pulsed shortwave diathermy and continuous shortwave diathermy. Shortwave diathermy devices created electromagnetic interference with a variety of electrical and medical devices. Physiotherapists reported that they did not stay in the treatment cubicle during the entire period of electrotherapy with pulsed shortwave diathermy or continous shortwave diathermy; pregnant physiotherapists reported that they did not use these <b>devices.</b> <b>Electrotherapy</b> with pulsed shortwave diathermy and continuous shortwave diathermy was not always administered on a wooden couch or chair. Electrotherapy was highest in those departments with the fewest physiotherapists. Conclusions. Departments report good practices and procedures regarding the use of therapeutic diathermy devices. However, field observations of practices and procedures, and the working environment, have identified issues with a potential to create health and safety problems, and these should be addressed.

40|$|The {{field of}} energy {{medicine}} {{has a long}} history in the United States dating back almost two centuries. During the 19 th century, there was a widespread interest in <b>electrotherapy</b> <b>devices</b> and many were sold in mail order catalogs. An overview of the development of the field of electrotherapy can be found in Dr. James Oschman‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúEnergy Medicine: The Scientific Basis ‚Äù (Oschman, 2000). Little academic research was done in this field in the United States after the Flexner Report of 1910 led to the overhaul of medical school education and research. Electrotherapy was declared scientifically unsupportable and was legally excluded from clinical practice. One of the few researchers who did excellent work was Dr. Harold Saxton Burr at Yale University who investigated energy fields in living systems from 1932 to 1956. He called these L fields.

The third phase was a questionnaire survey of 584 physiotherapists working in these departments. Variables concerned perception of health risk, health consequences and protection of health associated with different risk factors. Results: In the first two phases, the recruitment rate of the departments was 80. 7 % (46 out of 57) and response rate of those recruited was 100 % (n= 46). The response rate for the last phase of the study was 66. 8 % (390 out of 584). Results of the practices and procedures audit show that ultrasound was {{the most common form of}} electrotherapy while microwave diathermy was neither available nor used in these departments. Pulsed shortwave diathermy was used 4 - 5 days per week while continuous shortwave diathermy was used rarely. Electrotherapy was provided to up to 50 % of patients per week in the departments. The observational visits to the departments revealed that there were metallic objects within close proximity of diathermy equipment and wooden treatment couches for treatment with PSWD and CSWD were rare. The risk perception survey showed that physiotherapists generally perceived a moderate health risk and health consequences (harm) from exposure to EMF emissions from <b>electrotherapy</b> <b>devices.</b> Protection from EMFs in physiotherapy departments was generally perceived as ‚Äòusually‚Äô possible. Conclusions: Physiotherapy departments report safe electrotherapy practices. Use of diathermy devices that use RF EMFs is declining. The key predictors of physiotherapists‚Äô perception of health risk were perception of health consequences and vice versa. Gender was a significant predictor of the perception of health risks and health consequences. The main predictor of perception of protection against risk was the knowledge of environmental and health issues. Latent dimensions of perceptions of health risk, health consequences and protection from risk were identified and confirmed and their predictors were determined.
