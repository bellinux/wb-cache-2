40|$|PURPOSE: Exercise {{and chest}} {{physiotherapy}} are integral components of cystic fibrosis (CF) care. We aimed to determine short-term {{effects of a}} combined exercise-physiotherapy intervention, using either <b>trampoline</b> or cycle <b>exercises</b> compared to billiard (sham training) on sputum production, oxygen saturation (SaO 2) and short-term lung function in participants with CF. METHODS: Twelve 16 - to 29 -year-old individuals with CF were randomly allocated to all 3 interventions on non-consecutive days of a week with exercise and physiotherapy parts lasting 30 min and breaks of 30 min after each procedure. Sputum weight (g) and lung function were measured {{before and after the}} exercise + rest and physiotherapy + rest interventions and SaO 2 was measured before and after the combined interventions. Differences in outcome measures between the different exercises and combined exercise/physiotherapy regimens were analyzed by univariate multilevel linear regression. RESULTS: Sputum expectoration during and after <b>trampoline</b> <b>exercise</b> was significantly higher than with and after billiard (P = 0. 021), and tended to be higher than with and after cycling of similar cardiovascular intensity (P = 0. 074). Sputum weights during and after physiotherapy were comparable among sessions, irrespective of the prior exercise or sham procedure. The increase in SaO 2 was significantly higher after the combined trampoline/physiotherapy (1. 7 ± 0. 9 %) and cycling/physiotherapy (1. 8 ± 0. 8 %) sessions compared to billiard/physiotherapy (0. 5 ± 1. 8 %, P = 0. 011 and P = 0. 007). No effects were observed on lung function. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise followed by physiotherapy has an additive effect on sputum production in participants with CF and leads to improved oxygen saturation. Exercises with increased ventilation combined with mechanical vibration seem to be most efficient...|$|R
40|$|Background: Physical {{exercises}} {{can influence}} some anthropometric and fitness components differently. The aim of {{present study was}} to evaluate how a relatively long-term training program in 11 - 14 -year-old male Iranian students affects their anthropometric and motor performance measures. Methods: Measurements were conducted on the anthropometric and fitness components of participants (n = 28) prior to and following the program. They trained 20 weeks, 1. 5 h/session with 10 min rest, in 4 times trampoline training programs per week. Motor performance of all participants was assessed using standing long jump and vertical jump based on Eurofit Test Battery. Results: The analysis of variance (ANOVA) repeated measurement test showed a statistically significant main effect of time in calf girth P = 0. 001, fat% P = 0. 01, vertical jump P = 0. 001, and long jump P = 0. 001. The ANOVA repeated measurement test revealed a statistically significant main effect of group in fat% P = 0. 001. Post hoc paired t-tests indicated statistical significant differences in trampoline group between the two measurements about calf girth (t = − 4. 35, P = 0. 001), fat% (t = 5. 87, P = 0. 001), vertical jump (t = − 5. 53, P = 0. 001), and long jump (t = − 10. 00, P = 0. 001). Conclusions: We can conclude that 20 -week trampoline training with four physical activity sessions/week in 11 - 14 -year-old students seems to {{have a significant effect on}} body fat% reduction and effective results in terms of anaerobic physical fitness. Therefore, it is suggested that different training model approach such as <b>trampoline</b> <b>exercises</b> can help students to promote the level of health and motor performance...|$|R
40|$|Balance {{and motor}} {{impairments}} are most evident among inactive individuals with ID {{that might be}} particularly susceptible {{to a loss of}} basic functioning and further limit the person's autonomy in activities of daily living. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the effect of a 12 -week <b>trampoline</b> <b>exercise</b> intervention program on motor and balance ability of school aged children with intellectual disability (ID). Eighteen healthy schools aged children (mean age = 10. 3 +/- 1. 6 years) with moderate ID were assigned either to an experimental group (n = 9) or a control group (n = 9). The experiment group attended a 12 weeks trampoline training intervention program consisting of daily individualized 20 -min sessions, while the control group followed the regular school schedule. Balance was assessed using three tasks of increased difficulty (double-leg stance with eyes opened or closed, and one-leg stance with eyes opened) performed while standing on an electronic pressure platform (EPS). Motor performance of all participants was tested using sit and reach test and long and vertical jump tests all derived from the Eurofit Test Battery of physical fitness. Trampoline intervention resulted in significant improvements of participants' performance in all motor and balance tests. In conclusion, trampoline training can be an effective intervention for improving functional outcomes and can be recommended as an alternative mode of physical activity programming for improving balance and motor performance. Furthermore, it also supports the idea that individuals with ID require enjoyable and interesting intervention programs such as the trampoline program used in this study so as to remain active and consequently to facilitate their overall development and promote a more active and healthier way of life.

40|$|For my {{bachelor}} thesis I {{chose the}} theme ?The Effect of Jumping Exercise on Postural Functions of the Spine. ? Jumping {{is safe and}} gentle aerobic <b>exercise</b> on mini <b>trampolines,</b> which has beneficial effect on virtually all systems of the human body. Speaking about the deep stabilization system, we mean muscle interplay mm. multifidi, diaphragm, pelvic floor and abdominal muscles, which together regulate intra-abdominal pressure. This muscular interplay which ensures stabilization of the spine is activated throughout all movements. Its dysfunction {{is one of the}} most significant factors causing back pain. The jumping exercise strengthens these important muscles and improves the overall stability of the body. The objective of the research was to assess the deep stabilization system with respect to kinesiology and kinesiotherapy and to find out whether and how the jumping exercise influences the postural functions of the spine. The data for the thesis were collected by means of qualitative research, by the method of case study and the technique of personal case study. The examination of probands includes a brief history, palpation and visual examination, the examination of deep stabilizing system by functional tests and then also the testing by L. A. S. A. R posture device. Based on the comparison of the initial examination and the final examination, which followed after 10 weeks of jumping exercise, a previously set research question was answered. The thesis involves the theoretical part, which describes the jumping exercise, anatomy, examination of the deep stabilization system and its importance for our body. The practical part involves objectives of the thesis, research questions, the description of methodology, discussions with the authors from which I drew information and primarily, processed results in the form of case reports. The research results show that there were clear positive effects of the deep stabilization system and other structures in all probands. On the jumping lessons the probands were regularly forced to activate the muscles of the deep stabilization system, which resulted in reduction of back pains, in reduction of knee pain in one case and the overall stability of the body improved. The results of the thesis could be used in therapeutic procedures of physiotherapists, for the purposes of further research, in teaching and also in the implementation of more efficient jumping lesson, etc...|$|R
