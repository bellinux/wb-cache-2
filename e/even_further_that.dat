5000|$|In Europe, {{organized}} {{thought about}} public speaking began in ancient Greece. Possibly, {{the first study}} {{about the power of}} language may be attributed to the philosopher Empedocles (d. c. 444 BC), whose theories on human knowledge would provide a basis for many future rhetoricians. The first written manual is attributed to Corax and his pupil Tisias. Their work, {{as well as that of}} many of the early rhetoricians, grew out of the courts of law; Tisias, for example, is believed to have written judicial speeches that others delivered in the courts. Teaching in oratory was popularized in the 5th century BC by itinerant teachers known as sophists, the best known of whom were Protagoras (c. 481-420 BC), Gorgias (c. 483-376 BC), and Isocrates (436-338 BC). The Sophists were a disparate group who travelled from city to city, teaching in public places to attract students and offer them an education. Their central focus was on logos or what we might broadly refer to as discourse, its functions and powers. They defined parts of speech, analyzed poetry, parsed close synonyms, invented argumentation strategies, and debated the nature of reality. They claimed to make their students [...] "better," [...] or, in other words, to teach virtue. They thus claimed that human [...] "excellence" [...] was not an accident of fate or a prerogative of noble birth, but an art or [...] "techne" [...] that could be taught and learned. They were thus among the first humanists. Several sophists also questioned received wisdom about the gods and the Greek culture, which they believed was taken for granted by Greeks of their time, making them among the first agnostics. For example, they argued that cultural practices were a function of convention or nomos rather than blood or birth or phusis. They argued <b>even</b> <b>further</b> <b>that</b> morality or immorality of any action could not be judged outside of the cultural context within which it occurred. The well-known phrase, [...] "Man is the measure of all things" [...] arises from this belief. One of their most famous, and infamous, doctrines has to do with probability and counter arguments. They taught that every argument could be countered with an opposing argument, that an argument's effectiveness derived from how [...] "likely" [...] it appeared to the audience (its probability of seeming true), and that any probability argument could be countered with an inverted probability argument. Thus, if it seemed likely that a strong, poor man were guilty of robbing a rich, weak man, the strong poor man could argue, on the contrary, that this very likelihood (that he would be a suspect) makes it unlikely that he committed the crime, since he would most likely be apprehended for the crime. They also taught and were known for their ability to make the weaker (or worse) argument the stronger (or better). Aristophanes famously parodies the clever inversions that sophists were known for in his play The Clouds.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{grandparents}} {{can play}} a crucial role in the lives of their grandchildren in terms of education, only recently has grandparenthood been a topic in international literature. Studies have suggested that the extent of grandparental investment is influenced by age, gender and paternal/maternal side. Purpose: 1) explore grandparents’ perception of their relation with grandchildren; 2) investigate whether grandparent's gender, age and maternal/paternal side have influenced grandparents’ perception. Methods: A 26 item self-report questionnaire was administered to 373 Italian grandparents (153 male) age ranging between 53 and 88 years of age. The questionnaire aimed to investigate attitudes and feelings towards grandchild, shared activities, and viewpoint on their children's parenting style. Results displayed that grandmothers shared activities with their grandchildren more than grandfathers (p<. 01); the paternal grandparents shared activities with their grandchildren, more than maternal ones (p<. 01). No statistically significant differences were found between younger and older grandparent groups. Conclusions. Throughout literature maternal grandparents have always been indicated as the ones more involved in grandchildren’ lives, our results show that paternal grandparents share activities with grandchildren more than maternal ones. These results confirm <b>even</b> <b>further</b> <b>that</b> grandparents play a major role in grandchildren education...|$|E
