5|$|In a final {{flashback}} scene, Guevara is {{aboard the}} Granma in 1956, {{looking out over}} the ocean, as the Cuban Revolution is about to begin. He sees the Castro brothers alone at the bow of the ship; Fidel is talking and Raúl is taking notes. Guevara hands a peeled orange to one of his comrades and returns <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lone brothers before the scene fades to black.|$|E
25|$|In {{all three}} works of The Russian Series {{the details are}} located in the corners or away from the center. The wholeness of the “sandy color, that of soil” is left intact, {{interrupted}} in a discrete manner almost secretively or mistakenly. Yet the dominance of the center overpowers the viewer, returning <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> middle and away from the discrepancies in color. Kabakov would repeat this strategy from 1983-1988 with a second series called Three Green Paintings. In this series, rather than depict objects, he placed texts on the upper left and right hand corners of what is otherwise a field of green enamel paint.|$|E

50|$|In {{the final}} scene, Brody is jogging through Washington. As he jogs, {{we see more}} of his {{memories}} of the Tom Walker beating. This time it's clear that, under command from Abu Nazir, it was actually Brody himself who beat Walker to death.

50|$|Hitler, {{taken aback}} by his defeat over the skies of Britain, now turned <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> eastward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union. Despite having signed the non-aggression pact with Stalin, Hitler despised {{communism}} and wished to destroy it {{in the land of}} its birth. He originally planned <b>to</b> launch <b>the</b> attack in early spring of 1941 <b>to</b> avoid <b>the</b> disastrous Russian winter. However, a pro-allied coup in Yugoslavia and Mussolini's almost utter defeat in his invasion of Greece from occupied Albania prompted Hitler to launch a personal campaign of revenge in Yugoslavia and to occupy Greece at the same time. The Greeks would have a bitter revenge of sorts; the attack caused a delay of several crucial weeks of the invasion of the USSR.|$|R
40|$|Australian historiography, in the 1970 s and 1980 s, was {{dominated}} by a nativist reaction against Anglocentricity and the dreaded ‘cultural cringe’. Its more extreme manifestations rejected any comparative perspective that might blur an exclusive focus on Australia’s historical distinctiveness. But time, and academic fashion, moved on. Now John Gascoigne directs <b>his</b> formidably learned <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> social history of ideas in Australia from 1788 <b>to</b> 1850. <b>The</b> result is an engaging, lucid and wide-ranging overview, which triumphantly re-emphasises the intellectual benefits of integrating the study of Australia’s colonial past more closely with that of imperial Britain...|$|R
60|$|And {{then she}} turned away. Boldwood dropped <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, and stood long {{like a man who}} did not know where he was.

No wrinkles are visible on his youthful face, and he is visible wearing a dark jacket, light shirt, and what appears to be a small bowtie.; Picture file card reads: "He was the father of Marie S. Lopez de Cummings and grandson of Claudio Lopez who came to mission San Gabriel as assistant to Father Salordio Juan. Lopez who arrived at San Diego on the same vessel remained there with Father Juan at the mission. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{left hand}} appears {{out of the}} {{darkness}} and gently rests on B. As the man raises his head it withdraws. The right appears with a cup from which B drinks. It vanishes and then reappears to gently wipe his brow with a cloth. Then it disappears again. B raises <b>his</b> head <b>to</b> <b>gaze</b> upon <b>the</b> invisible face and holds out his right hand, palm upward. The right hand returns and rests on B’s right hand. He looks at the two hands together and adds his left hand. Together the three hands sink <b>to</b> <b>the</b> table and B rests his head on them. Finally the left hand comes {{out of the darkness}} and rests gently on his head.|$|R
40|$|Georg Simmel was {{the first}} great figure in sociology’s {{classical}} tradition to set out a distinctive conception of society not as a supra-individual structure but {{as a series of}} enabling and constraining interactions and associations among human beings. His novel insight was <b>to</b> direct <b>his</b> analytical <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sociological significance of ordinary experiences and everyday interactions, highlighting features of their details that have since made him a significant forerunner of symbolic interactionism. Simmel brought an original approach to this sociologically unexamined field, addressing the ‘formal’ features of everyday practices that stood apart from the personal propensities, drives and inclinations of individual persons. The chapter traces the impact of Simmel’s thinking on the emergence of symbolic interactionism, principally through the sociology of the Chicago School. Simmel’s method and analytic attitude were adapted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> strongly empirical bent of the interactionist perspective. Extant commentary does not give sufficient attention to how Simmel presented a model of social being that underlined the importance of knowledge in social life in a way consistent with interactionism’s pragmatist roots. Simmel showed the importance of thinking imaginatively about the constituent elements of social life – he held out the prospect of “finding in each of life’s details the totality of its meaning” (Simmel 1978 : 55). The chapter explores how Simmel accomplished this aim and why he was of such importance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of interactionist sociology...|$|R

Its speed was headlong, terrific; and, beneath it, covering the sea, advancing with it, was a gray bank of mist.|$|E
2500|$|Even as the Captains of the West {{were about}} to be utterly {{defeated}} by the superior might of Sauron's grand armies, Frodo reached his goal, entering the fiery interior of Mount Doom. However, his will failed at the last moment; unable <b>to</b> resist <b>the</b> growing power of the Ring, he put it on his finger and claimed it for his own. Sauron was instantly aware of him, and <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> turned immediately <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Door in the Mountain. Recalling his remaining Nazgûl from the ongoing battle, he commanded them to hasten to Mount Doom in a desperate attempt <b>to</b> secure <b>the</b> Ring. It was too late, however: Gollum attacked Frodo, bit the Ring from his finger, then lost his footing and fell with the Ring into the fire. With [...] "a roar and a great confusion of noise", the One Ring perished along with all the power Sauron had invested in it. Tolkien later commented in one of his letters that Gollum's convenient slip was an immediate intervention by Eru himself: Gollum's fate was [...] "bound up with that of the ring", as Gandalf predicted in the Mines of Moria.|$|R
40|$|A viewer’s visual {{attention}} during video playback is {{the matching}} of <b>his</b> eye <b>gaze</b> movement <b>to</b> <b>the</b> changing video content over time. If the gaze movement matches the video content (e. g., follow a rolling soccer ball), then the viewer keeps his visual attention. If the gaze location moves from one video object <b>to</b> another, then <b>the</b> viewer shifts his visual attention. A video that causes a viewer to shift his attention often is a “busy ” video. Determination of which video content is busy {{is an important}} practical problem; a busy video is difficult for encoder to deploy region of interest (ROI) -based bit allocation, and hard for content provider to insert additional overlays like advertisements, making the video even busier. One way <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> busyness of video content is <b>to</b> conduct eye <b>gaze</b> experiments with a sizable group of test subjects, but this is time-consuming and cost-ineffective. In this paper, we propose an alternative method <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> busyness of video—formally called video attention deviation (VAD) : analyze the spatial visual saliency maps of the video frames across time. We first derive transition probabilities of a Markov model for eye gaze using saliency maps {{of a number of}} consecutive frames. We then compute steady state probability of the saccade state in the model—our estimate of VAD. We demonstrate that the computed steady state probability for saccade using saliency map analysis matches that computed using actual gaze traces for a range of videos with different degrees of busyness. Further, our analysis {{can also be used to}} segment video into shorter clips of different degrees of busyness by computing the Kullback-Leibler divergence using consecutive motion compensated saliency maps...|$|R

But the averted head, the fixed attention, and the nearly immovable and statue-like attitude in which he stood, showed that a more powerful interest drew <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next group. Though ignorant of the cause of his intense regard, Adelheid instantly forgot the bailiff, his dogmatism, and his want of erudition, in the wish to examine those who approached.|$|E

When that was finished he had felt more sanguine as to his acquittal than he had done at any time since he had first given himself up as a prisoner. During the short pause which occurred in court immediately after McKeon left the table, he had once or twice looked round to learn if Feemy were coming, though the high woodwork of the dock would effectually prevent him from seeing her till she was at the table.|$|E
60|$|The Mexicans were leisurely cooking {{their morning}} meal. They had two fires, one for warmth, {{the other to}} cook over. Gale had an idea these raiders were {{familiar}} to him. It seemed all these border hawks resembled one another--being mostly small of build, wiry, angular, swarthy-faced, and black-haired, and they wore the oddly styled Mexican clothes and sombreros. A slow wrath stirred in Gale {{as he watched the}} trio. They showed not the slightest indication of breaking camp. One fellow, evidently the leader, packed a gun at his hip, the only weapon in sight. Gale noted this with speculative eyes. The raiders had slept inside the little adobe house, and had not yet brought out the carbines. Next Gale swept <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corral, in which he saw more than a dozen horses, some of them fine animals. They were stamping and whistling, fighting one another, and pawing the dirt. This was entirely natural behavior for desert horses penned in when they wanted to get at water and grass.|$|E
