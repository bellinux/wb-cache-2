5|$|Alex and {{the group}} {{discover}} Maggie Adler's plan to fix the temporal tears—transposing onto {{the other side and}} tuning within. Alex repeatedly has visions of the past, including talking with Michael. Alex and Jonas head to a lookout post to unlock a bomb shelter to find another way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> A ghost possesses Jonas and attempts to bargain with Alex, offering to spare her and the rest of her friends if they leave Clarissa behind. Inside the caves, Alex tunes into a rift that sends her into a void. Encountering the possessed Clarissa, Alex is warned that she will die if the rift is closed, but Clarissa will be kept if she goes through the portal. Alex can choose to leave, erasing Clarissa from existence; close the portal herself, trapping her with the ghosts; or, if she has found enough letters from Maggie Adler, Alex can appeal to the crew members directly, convincing them to let Clarissa and her go. The reflection of Alex seen throughout the game is revealed to be Alex from the future. She then loops back to a conversation to Michael, who admits that he and Clarissa are planning to move away from town. Time then corrects.|$|E

As Henry prepares, he follows the tracking device's signal to a cassette tape from Ned, who claims that Brian's death was because of climbing inexperience. Unwilling to return to society, Ned admits to living in the wilderness and is trekking deeper, advising against following him. Henry finds Ned's camp with items from the watchtowers, camp and the teenage girls, whom Delilah confirms are safe and sound. The government camp was studying wildlife, with Ned using radio equipment to deter Henry.

25|$|Ice Mine is a mine shaft {{that may}} have been dug by prospectors looking for iron ore. Iron ore was not {{discovered}} but the prospectors did create a natural refrigerator. This has been formed in the shaft by the freezing and thawing of the rocks, melting snows and humid summer air. The rocks freeze in winter, contracting and allowing air to fill the empty spaces. Melting snow flows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> and is refrozen as ice. The ice remains thanks to cool air flowing down the mountainside and humid air rising up the mountain into the shaft. This process keeps the mine shaft icy until late summer.|$|E

25|$|Seven years later, Utah is an FBI agent candidate. He {{attends a}} {{briefing}} on a skyscraper heist, {{in which the}} criminals steal diamonds, escaping by parachute, in Mumbai.

Utah's research concludes that they were done by the same men, who are attempting to complete the Ozaki 8, a list of eight extreme ordeals to honor the forces of nature. They have already completed three, and Utah predicts they'll attempt the fourth on a rare sea wave phenomenon in France. After presenting his analysis, Utah is sent undercover to France under a field agent named Pappas (Ray Winstone). They reach France and Utah gets help from others to surf the tall tube wave.|$|E

Finally they gave up. When they returned to the cave they remembered their fellow in the hole and they immediately pulled the rope up.
