5|$|The {{inductor}} is a conductor, {{usually a}} coil of wire, that stores energy in {{a magnetic field}} {{in response to the}} current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor. The <b>induced</b> <b>voltage</b> is proportional to the time rate of change of the current. The constant of proportionality is termed the inductance. The unit of inductance is the henry, named after Joseph Henry, a contemporary of Faraday. One henry is the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one ampere per second. The inductor's behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current, but opposes a rapidly changing one.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{response}} of an arbitrarily oriented two-wire transmission line (TL) excited by an electromagnetic (EM) field is examined. The TL is located inside a dissipative medium, which constitutes an infinite half-space, and the incident EM field {{is assumed to be}} a plane wave that is obliquely incidental to the interface between the lossy material about the TL and the fi-ee space. The response of the TL is investigated in terms of the <b>induced</b> <b>voltages</b> and currents at the TL termination loads, which are given in closed-form expressions. Moreover, a simple and general statistical description of the excitation EM field is introduced, based on an analysis of a typical fading propagation channel, in order to examine the statistical behavior of the <b>induced</b> terminal <b>voltages</b> in manmade environments, where a large amount of data is required for a complete deterministic description. The statistical description of the <b>induced</b> <b>voltages,</b> presented in this work, is utilizable in two directions.

2500|$|In {{the case}} when the disk alone spins there is no change in flux through the circuit, however, there is an {{electromotive}} force induced contrary to Faraday's law. We can also show an example {{when there is a}} change in flux, but no <b>induced</b> <b>voltage.</b> Figure 5 (near right) shows the setup used in Tilley's experiment. It is a circuit with two loops or meshes. There is a galvanometer connected in the right-hand loop, a magnet {{in the center of the}} left-hand loop, a switch in the left-hand loop, and a switch between the loops. We start with the switch on the left open and that on the right closed. When the switch on the left is closed and the switch on the right is open there is no change in the field of the magnet, but there is a change in the area of the galvanometer circuit. This means that there is a change in flux. However the galvanometer did not deflect meaning there was no <b>induced</b> <b>voltage,</b> and Faraday's law does not work in this case. According to A. G. Kelly this suggests that an <b>induced</b> <b>voltage</b> in Faraday's experiment is due to the [...] "cutting" [...] of the circuit by the flux lines, and not by [...] "flux linking" [...] or the actual change in flux. This follows from the Tilley experiment because there is no movement of the lines of force across the circuit and therefore no current induced although there is a change in flux through the circuit. Nussbaum suggests that for Faraday's law to be valid, work must be done in producing the change in flux.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} a modeling {{procedure that}} permits calculation of lightning-induced voltages on overhead lines {{starting from the}} channel-base current. The procedure makes use of 1) a lightning return-stroke model proposed by the authors for the calculation of the lightning electromagnetic field; and 2) a coupling model already presented in the literature based on the transmission line theory for field-to-overhead line coupling calculations.
