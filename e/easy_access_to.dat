5|$|From {{the early}} 1980s onwards {{projects}} aiming to improve Somerton for film industry purposes have been undertaken. The market square was heavily revamped, creating a central parking area with <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the local amenities. The BBC drama The Monocled Mutineer was filmed in Somerton from 1985 to 1986.|$|E

Junction 7 of the M60 is just {{to the north of}} Stretford's boundary with Sale, and the A56 road gives <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the south as well as to Manchester city centre in the other direction. Cycle paths exist as part of the Trafford cycle initiative.|$|E
5|$|It bred on rocky, {{isolated}} islands with <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> {{the ocean}} and a plentiful food supply, a rarity in nature that provided only a few breeding sites for the great auks.

5|$|Storlien, {{just on the}} Swedish side of the {{national}} border, grew up as a resort, with the first hotel established just after the railway arrived. Trade {{between the two countries}} increased, as Jämtland had <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the Trøndelag market. However, the freight rates were so high that it was cheaper to send some products to Trøndelag from the Swedish east coast by ship around Scania.|$|E

The title stems from Type-0s earlier title Final Fantasy Agito XIII. Many of Type-0s staff returned, with Takeharu Ishimoto composing new music for the title, and former level designer Masayasu Nishida and texture artist Sayoko Hoshino returning respectively as producer and art director.|$|E

The residential districts of Mile Town and Marine Town are in the central and the eastern areas respectively.|$|E
5|$|Afforestation {{projects}} have been undertaken to prevent groundwater pollution, secure drinking water, sequester CO2, increase biodiversity, create an attractive countryside, provide <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> nature and offer outdoor activities to the public. In 2000 the first project, the New Forests of Aarhus, was completed which aimed to double the forest cover in the municipality and in 2009 another phase was announced to double forest cover once more before the year 2030. The afforestation plans were realised as a local project in collaboration with private landowners, under a larger national agenda. Other projects to expand natural habitats include a rewilding effort in Geding-Kasted Bog and continuous monitoring of the four Natura 2000 areas in the municipality.|$|E
5|$|Although {{industry}} was rapidly expanding throughout {{the northern part}} of the state, Indiana remained largely rural at the turn of the 20th century with a growing population of 2.5million. Like much of the rest of the American Midwest, Indiana's exports and job providers remained largely agricultural until after World War I. Indiana's developing industry, backed by inexpensive natural gas from the large Trenton Gas Field, an educated population, low taxes, <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> transportation, and business-friendly government, led Indiana to grow into one of the leading manufacturing states by the mid-1920s.|$|E

5|$|Before the Revolution, New Englanders {{consumed}} {{large quantities}} of rum and beer as maritime trade provided relatively <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the goods needed to produce these items. Rum was the distilled spirit of choice as molasses, the main ingredient, was readily available from trade with the West Indies. In the continent's interior, colonists drank whiskey, as they had ready access to corn and rye but did not have good access to sugar cane. However, up until the Revolution, many colonists considered whiskey to be a coarse beverage unfit for human consumption, believing that it caused the poor to become raucous and disorderly.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the ranch and any lodging in the area, {{tourists}} flocked to this site. The 1887 completion of the Southern Pacific line {{increased the number of}} visitors, as the railroad featured the ranch in its advertisements in order to distinguish the line from its competitors. Although the ranch was not developed for tourism, the Del Valles, with their Californio sense of hospitality, would lodge the visitors. By October 1888, housing visitors was getting to be so expensive for the family that Reginaldo del Valle pressed his mother to stop being so hospitable. The tourists could be quite a nuisance, and unscrupulous visitors would steal items from the house as souvenirs, or help themselves to fruit from the orchards.|$|E
5|$|Faulty {{intelligence}} was the component that was mostly {{responsible for the}} failure of Adlertag. While the gap between the British and Germans was not yet wide in this regard, the British were starting to gain a decisive lead in intelligence. The breaking of the Enigma machine and poor Luftwaffe signals discipline allowed the British <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> German communications traffic. The impact of Ultra on the Battle of Britain is a matter of dispute, with Official Histories claiming there was no direct impact. Whatever the truth, Ultra, and the Y service in particular, gave the British an increasingly accurate picture of German order of battle deployments.|$|E

5|$|From 1800 to 1847, Banagher {{enjoyed a}} period of {{prosperity}} unequalled in its history. Corn growing had long {{been one of the}} chief agricultural activities of the district and the opening of the Grand Canal {{at the end of the}} 18th century gave <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Dublin and Limerick and brought cheap and efficient water transport to the district. Banagher became the outlet for the grain raised in a wide area round the town, and the Banagher corn market on Fridays was one of the largest of its kind in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Garrisoned by a captain, a knight, eight squires and ten crossbowmen, the Bastille was encircled with ditches {{fed by the}} River Seine, {{and faced}} with stone. The {{fortress}} had four sets of drawbridges, which allowed the Rue Saint-Antoine to pass eastwards through the Bastille's gates while giving <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the city walls on {{the north and south}} sides. The Bastille overlooked the Saint-Antoine gate, which by 1380 was a strong, square building with turrets and protected by two drawbridges of its own. Charles V chose to live close to the Bastille for his own safety and created a royal complex to the south of the fortress called the Hôtel St. Paul, stretching from the Porte Saint-Paul up to the Rue Saint-Antoine.|$|E
5|$|Gedi's {{participation}} in maritime trade {{can be seen}} in the increasing frequency of imports found at Gedi over the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Conditions along the Atlantic coast prevented European nations from opening sea lanes until the early-sixteenth century, limiting maritime trade to states with <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Many artifacts found at Gedi including much of the ceramics, all the beads, and the two Chinese coins resulted from either direct or indirect trade with the Near East, Arabia, China, India, and Indochina. Swahili coastal settlements exported gold, ivory, slaves, ebony, mangrove poles, copper, copal gum, frankincense, myrrh, and crystal rock.|$|E
