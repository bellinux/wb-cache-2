30|$|In {{this section}} the authors discuss {{whether there are}} any differing views on the {{statement}} ‘It is too difficult to integrate multiple modes of transport in ICT’ that achieved a <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> agreement by all types of participants groups. But the authors find {{that there are some}} differences (see Table  5) among the sub-groups. The TLSP and the Terminal Operator sub-groups had a similar (<b>simple</b> <b>majority)</b> agreement whereas the Academic-Researcher sub-group had a <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> disagreement. Both SMEs and Non-SMEs sub-groups had a similar (<b>simple</b> <b>majority)</b> agreement. There are some differences among the Geographic sub-groups. The Non-EU sub-group had a full agreement whereas the Northern EU sub-group had a <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> disagreement. The remaining sub-groups had a <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> agreement. There are some major differences among the ICT sub-groups. The ICT-Expert had a vast majority agreement; the ICT-Competent sub-group had a <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> disagreement whereas the ICT-Basic sub-group had a <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> agreement. In contrast two sub-groups: Academic-Researcher and Northern EU had majority disagreement. The authors find that although the statement had achieved a majority agreement, in particular taking into account of the views of the TLSP and Terminal Operator who have better practical experience over the Academic-Researcher sub-group.|$|R

In our evaluation we are using an a priori voting power methodology to measure an influence of the Member States before and after extension of the EU.

30|$|Similarly the {{statement}} ‘German ICT will dominate eLogistics in Europe as German logistics continues to dominate’ had achieved a <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> disagreement by {{all types of}} participants groups. But there are some differences among the sub-groups.

The remaining sub-groups had a <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> disagreement. The authors consider that although the statement had achieved a majority disagreement, the message is mixed and not clear enough and thus further research will be needed.|$|R

40|$|Little {{attention}} has been paid to the differences between absolute <b>majority</b> rule and <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> rule, which differ in their treatment of absences and ‘votes to abstain’. This article fills that gap by undertaking a probabilistic analysis of the two voting rules assuming two alternatives and a quorum requirement for <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> rule. The rules are compared in both a modified sincere setting and a strategic setting using five criteria: (1) the Pareto criterion, (2) the BT criterion (Buchanan and Tullock, 1962), (3) the Expected Social Gain criterion, (4) the Responsiveness criterion, and (5) a modified version of Rae’s criterion. In the sincere setting, we find that <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> rule (with and without a quorum) outperforms absolute majority rule under most conditions for four out of the five criteria. In the strategic setting, we find that the voting rules perform much more similarly. absolute <b>majority</b> rule; <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> rule; social choice; voter turnout...|$|R

30|$|The {{statement}} ‘German ICT {{will dominate}} eLogistics in Europe as German logistics continues to dominate’ also achieved a <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> disagreement, {{although there are}} some differing views (from a significant majority agreement to a <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> disagreement) among the sub-groups. The authors find that although German logistics dominance in the EU logistics area is a reality and is growing, the German ICT industry will not dominate similarly.|$|R

Otherwise the process continues, but only the members of the minority keep agenda and voting rights for the second stage, in which the financing scheme is determined. In the second stage, the unanimity rule or the <b>simple</b> <b>majority</b> rule is applied.
