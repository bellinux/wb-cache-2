50|$|Various bird organs {{function}} to differentiate avian immune cells: the thymus, Bursa of Fabricius and bone marrow are primary avian lymphoid organs whereas the spleen, mucosal associated lymphoid tissues (MALT), germinal centers, and diffuse lymphoid tissues are secondary lymphoid organs. Birds {{do not have}} lymph nodes. The thymus, where T cells develop, {{is located in the}} neck of birds. The Bursa of Fabricius is an organ that is unique to birds and is the only site for B cell differentiation and maturation. Located in the rump of birds, this organ is full of stem cells and very active in young birds but atrophies after six months.Bronchial associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) and gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) are found along the bronchus and intestines, respectively. In the avian respiratory system, there are heterophils, which {{are an important part of}} bird immunity. Within the head, there is head associated lymphoid tissues (HALT) that contain the <b>Harderian</b> <b>gland,</b> lacrimal gland and other structures in the larynx or nasopharynx. The <b>Harderian</b> <b>gland</b> is located behind the eyeballs and is the major component of HALT. It contains a large number of plasma cells and is the main secretory body of antibodies.Alongside these primary and secondary lymphoid organs, there is also the lymphatic circulatory system of vessels and capillaries that communicate with the blood supply and transport the lymph fluid throughout the birdâs body.|$|E
50|$|The early mammaliaforms {{did have}} a <b>harderian</b> <b>gland,</b> in modern mammals used for {{cleaning}} the fur, indicating that they, contrary to their Cynodont ancestors, had a furry covering. An insulative covering is necessary to keep a homeothermic animal warm if it is very small, less than 5 cm (1.97 in) long; The 3.2 cm (1.35 in) Hadrocodium must have had fur, therefore, but the 10 cm (3.94 in) Morganucodon might not have needed it. The docodont Castorocauda, further removed from crown group mammals than Hadrocodium, had two layers of fur, guard hairs and underfur, as do mammals today.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{sequential}} {{light and}} electron microscopic {{study of the}} exorbital and <b>Harderian</b> lacrimal <b>glands</b> was done on 2. 5 - to 15 -month-old Wistar rats exposed to sialodacryoadenitis (SDA) virus. Typical coronaviral particles were readily demonstrated in cytoplasmic vesicles of <b>Harderian</b> and exorbital <b>glands</b> examined at 6 days post-inoculation. Lesions were seen in a relatively high percentage of lacrimal glands in infected animals of all ages, with no obvious age-related variations in the incidence and extent of changes. Lesions frequently persisted for a longer interval post-exposure in lacrimal glands than in salivary glands. The persistence of lesions commonly seen in <b>Harderian</b> <b>glands</b> was attributed, at least in part, to the cytotoxic effects of porphyrin-containing secretions released during the acute necrotizing stages of the disease. The persistence of lesions in some lacrimal glands indicates that they are useful tissues for microscopic examination for the retrospective provisional diagnosis of SDA. Persistent lesions also indicate that normal functions of these glands may be compromised for up to several weeks following outbreaks of SDA.

50|$|The cynodonts {{probably}} had {{some form of}} warm-blooded metabolism. This has led to many reconstructions of cynodonts as having fur.

Modern mammals have <b>Harderian</b> <b>glands</b> secreting lipids to coat their fur, but the telltale imprint of this structure is only found from the primitive mammal Morganucodon and onwards. Nonetheless, recent studies on Permian synapsid coprolites show that more basal therapsids had fur, and at any rate fur was already present in Mammaliaformes such as Castorocauda and Megaconus.|$|R

5000|$|The {{quantitative}} biological {{effects of}} cosmic rays are poorly known, {{and are the}} subject of ongoing research. Several experiments, both in space and on Earth, are being carried out to evaluate the exact degree of danger. Additionally, the impact of the space microgravity environment on DNA repair has in part confounded the interpretation of some results. [...] Experiments over the last 10 years have shown results both higher and lower than predicted by current quality factors used in radiation protection, indicating large uncertainties exist. Experiments in 2007 at Brookhaven National Laboratory's NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) suggest that biological damage due to a given exposure is actually about half what was previously estimated: specifically, it turns out that low energy protons cause more damage than high energy ones. This is {{explained by the fact that}} slower particles have more time to interact with molecules in the body. This may be interpreted as an acceptable result for space travel as the cells affected end up with greater energy deposition and are more likely to die without proliferating into tumors. This is in contrast to the current dogma on radiation exposure to human cells which considers lower energy radiation of higher weighting factor for tumor formation. Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) depends on radiation type described by particle charge number, Z, and kinetic energy per amu, E, and varies with tumor type with limited experimental data suggesting leukemia's having the lowest RBE, liver tumors the highest RBE, and limited or no experimental data on RBE available for cancers that dominate human cancer risks including lung, stomach, breast, and bladder cancers. Studies of <b>Harderian</b> <b>gland</b> tumors in a single strain of female mice with several heavy ions have been made, however it is not clear how well the RBE for this tumor type represents the RBE for human cancers such as lung, stomach, breast and bladder cancers nor how RBE changes with sex and genetic background.|$|E
