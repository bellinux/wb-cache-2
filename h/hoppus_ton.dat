50|$|The hoppus {{cubic foot}} (or ‘hoppus cube’ or ‘h cu ft’) was the {{standard}} volume measurement used for timber in the British Empire and {{countries in the}} British sphere of influence before the introduction of metric units. It is still used in the hardwood trade of some countries.This volume measurement was developed to estimate what volume of a round log would be usable timber after processing, in effect attempting to ‘square’ the log and allow for waste.The <b>hoppus</b> <b>ton</b> (HT) was also a traditionally used unit of volume in British forestry. One <b>hoppus</b> <b>ton</b> is equal to 50 hoppus feet or 1.8027 cubic metres. Some shipments of tropical hardwoods, especially shipments of teak from Myanmar (Burma), are still stated in hoppus tons.|$|E
