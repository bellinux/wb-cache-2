5|$|Since 1987, <b>Gates</b> <b>has</b> been {{included}} in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people. From 1995 to 2009, he held the title of the richest person in the world all but four of those years, and held it consistently from 2014â€“July 2017, with an estimated net worth of US$89.9billion as of October 2017. However, on July 27, 2017, and since October 27, 2017, he has been surpassed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, who has an estimated net worth of US$93.9billion. In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy. The foundation works to save lives and improve global health, and is working with Rotary International to eliminate polio.|$|E
5|$|Malaria {{has been}} {{successfully}} eliminated or greatly reduced in certain areas. Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe, but vector control programs, {{in conjunction with the}} monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from those regions. Several factors contributed, such as the draining of wetland breeding grounds for agriculture and other changes in water management practices, and advances in sanitation, including greater use of glass windows and screens in dwellings. Malaria was eliminated from most parts of the USA in the early 20th century by such methods, {{and the use of the}} pesticide DDT and other means eliminated it from the remaining pockets in the South in the 1950s as part of the National Malaria Eradication Program. Bill <b>Gates</b> <b>has</b> said that he thinks global eradication is possible by 2040.|$|E
5|$|Scully theorizes that <b>Gates</b> <b>has</b> brought Kevin to a {{recycling}} plant he owns in Jerusalem, Ohio. Mulder {{thinks that he}} has headed to the airport, as a man matching Gates' description was reported headed there. Mulder thinks Scully believes that she's been chosen to protect Kevin. Scully arrives at the recycling plant where Gates tells Kevin that he must die for the 'New Age' to come. Gates attempts to jump into a paper shredding machine with Kevin, but Kevin grabs onto the side as Gates falls into the shredder. Scully is able to pull Kevin to safety. Two days later, Scully and Kevin say goodbye. Kevin tells Scully he'll see her again. Scully goes to the confessional {{for the first time}} in years, wondering if God is speaking, but that no one is listening.|$|E
