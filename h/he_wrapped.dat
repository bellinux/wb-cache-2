25|$|Faraday's {{breakthrough}} {{came when}} <b>he</b> <b>wrapped</b> two insulated coils of wire around an iron ring, {{and found that}} upon passing a current through one coil a momentary current was induced in the other coil. This phenomenon {{is now known as}} mutual induction. The iron ring-coil apparatus is still on display at the Royal Institution. In subsequent experiments, he found that if he moved a magnet through a loop of wire an electric current flowed in that wire. The current also flowed if the loop was moved over a stationary magnet. His demonstrations established that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field; this relation was modelled mathematically by James Clerk Maxwell as Faraday's law, which subsequently became one of the four Maxwell equations, and which have in turn evolved into the generalization known today as field theory. Faraday would later use the principles he had discovered to construct the electric dynamo, the ancestor of modern power generators and the electric motor.|$|E
