5|$|When {{the album}} {{virtually}} failed to chart, {{the band was}} ready to split but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> on tour to pay off its debts. On 27 January 1986, their final Melbourne concert was recorded and released as the live album The Final Wave in October. The band performed its final concert on 1 February at the Perth Entertainment Centre.|$|E
5|$|White {{said that}} The Troubles in Northern Ireland induced {{him to write}} about the sort of world he would like to live in, and that he disliked war and militarists. As a youth he wanted to become a doctor, but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> to work. Hence he relied on {{epidemics}} and natural disasters to provide the conflicts that stories need to make them interesting. He credited his wife, who was an intensive care nurse at the height of The Troubles, for advice on medical details and for pointing out how padres often did more good than doctors for disturbed patients, which inspired The Genocidal Healer.|$|E
500|$|Rodgers {{finished}} with a game-high 20 assists and later said: [...] "It was the easiest game ever {{for me to get}} assists, all I had to do was pass it to Wilt." [...] Attles was a defensive specialist who rarely scored, yet went 8â€“8 from the field and hit his single free throw. He later lamented, [...] "In the game where I literally couldn't miss, Wilt <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and score 100." ...|$|E

500|$|Since Grohl {{felt the}} songs were {{different}} from the band's previous input and [...] "had {{the potential to be}} something great", he considered that instead of doing something like the last three albums, the band <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> of [...] "our own comfort zone" [...] and [...] "needed someone to push us out of there". So Grohl decided to work again with Gil Norton, who produced the band's second album The Colour and the Shape, citing how Norton taught the band of the importance of pre-production and refining the composition, and claiming Norton's [...] "unconventional" [...] approach [...] "seems to capture the best of this band", considering that with him [...] "we're not going to do a straightforward AC/DC record, he's gonna make it different".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the passage}} of the Great Reform Bill, the nature of the {{position}} changed: Prime Ministers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> among the people. The Bill increased the electorate to 717,000. Subsequent legislation (and population growth) raised it to 2million in 1867, 5.5million in 1884 and 21.4million in 1918. As the franchise increased, power shifted to the people and Prime Ministers assumed more responsibilities with respect to party leadership. It naturally fell on them to motivate and organise their followers, explain party policies, and deliver its [...] "message". Successful leaders had to have a new set of skills: to give a good speech, present a favourable image, and interact with a crowd. They became the [...] "voice", the [...] "face" [...] and the [...] "image" [...] of the party and ministry.|$|E
