Hormonal therapy in menopause proved its efficiency, {{especially for the}} improvement of the climacteric symptoms, as the long term effects on cardiovascular diseases is still being studied. The patients treated with Climara and Riselle showed, after 2 years of treatment, a libido and a decrease of hot <b>flushes.</b> No <b>matter</b> what the type of menopause you monitor, the LDL cholesterol shows a significant decrease for the lots that are treated with hormones.

5000|$|Ruediger was one {{of three}} fighters on The Ultimate Fighter 5 who had {{previously}} fought inside the UFC's Octagon (the others being Joe Lauzon and Matt Wiman). Only Lauzon, of the three, had a victory in the UFC. In episode 5, Team Pulver selected Corey Hill to fight Ruediger. The episode showed Ruediger eating ice cream cake after learning of his upcoming fight, shortly before the weigh ins. He was then struggling to make the weight requirement, and let himself be dragged to and from the sauna room, but getting out before it could actually work. Ultimately, Penn and Maynard gave up and walked off as Ruediger literally begged for them to pick him back up. After displaying what could be signs of extreme exhaustion, an ambulance carried him off to the hospital. This marks the first time in Ruediger's career that he missed weight. He took direct criticism from his own coaches and teammates for [...] "taking short cuts" [...] and displaying a lack of dedication, due to his request for a colonic to lose weight (a procedure where they input plastic tubes up your rectum to <b>flush</b> fecal <b>matter</b> out of your system) and his overall poor work ethic. The next day, Dana White dismissed Ruediger from the competition and he was ordered to leave the house.|$|R
30|$|Nitrogen is the {{nutrient}} that potentially retards phytoplankton production in temperate marine systems (Caraco et al. 1987; Howarth 1988). In shallow coastal lagoons, the predominant form of inorganic nitrogen is ammonium (Serpa et al. 2007). In sediments, there is lesser diffusion of oxygen that primarily reduces rate of nitrification consequently there is low concentrations of nitrates in the sediments. In the present study, {{the emphasis was}} on the available nitrogen {{in the form of}} TKN. The mean TKN of seawater was 73.47  mg/l while that of sediment was 146.22  mg/kg. The TKN concentration was exceptionally higher in all sediment samples. This could also be attributed to <b>flushing</b> of organic <b>matter</b> that originates from anthropogenic sources. Another possible source of TKN could be the disposal of dead fishes in the creek from the fishing communities. In general, both N and P are responsible for increased primary productivity of the creek area.|$|R
40|$|Two intense rainfalls [Hurricane Joaquin (2015) and Hurricane Matthew (2016) ], {{one year}} apart, {{provided}} {{a unique opportunity}} to examine changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics in coastal blackwater rivers under extreme flooding conditions in the southeastern United States. Two sites along Waccamaw River (a coastal blackwater river) and the outflow of 18 sub-basins of Yadkin-Pee Dee Basin were sampled during and after the flooding events. The peaks of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) concentrations were observed 18 and 23 days after peak discharge in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Moreover, DOM aromaticity and abundance of humic substances significantly increased during the same period. Separation of discharge hydrograph into surface runoff and subsurface flow suggested that temporal changes were mainly due to contributions from subsurface flow <b>flushing</b> organic <b>matter</b> from wetlands and organic-rich riparian zones. The spatial analysis highlighted the key role of the forested wetlands as the only land use that significantly correlated with both DOM quantity (DOC and DON load) and DOM composition (i. e., aromaticity). The Yadkin-Pee Dee River basin alone exported more than 474 million kg DOC into the ocean during high-flow conditions from the 2016 event, indicating that such extreme short-term events mobilized enormous amounts of organic carbon and nitrogen to the ocean. Considering the predicted increase in frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events in the eastern U. S., {{the results of this study}} can shed light on changes in DOM dynamics that may occur under such conditions in the near future...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We have deduced {{short-term}} climatic {{changes from}} millennial to annual scales {{from the study}} of laminae thickness and radiocarbon analysis of Holocene stalagmite records from two caves in Ortigosa de Cameros (Iberian Range, northern Spain). Speleothems are made up of dark compact laminae (DCL) and white porous laminae (WPL) of seasonal origin. Couplets seasonality is deduced from monitoring calcite laminae growth, drip water rates, and soil organic <b>matter</b> <b>flushed</b> into the caves. The thickness variations of the couplets are analyzed using a continuous wavelet transform and the various periodicities at interannual, decadal, multidecadal, and centennial scales are revealed from the wavelet power spectrum. The periodicities at decadal, multidecadal and centennial scales, with periods around 9. 7, 10. 4, 14, 16, 22, 43, 73, 83 and 180 years, are mainly related to solar activity. Among the interannual periodicities, oscillations around the 2. 4 -yr-period may be linked to the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), whereas periods ranging from 4 to 7 years may be associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and/or the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) ...|$|R
40|$|Handling {{systems can}} {{influence}} the production of biogas and methane from dairy farm manures. A comparative work performed in three different Italian dairy farms showed how the most common techniques (scraper, slatted floor, flushing) can change the characteristics of collected manure. Scraper {{appears to be the}} most neutral choice, as it does not significantly affect the original characteristics of manure. Slatted floor produces a manure that has a lower methane potential in comparison with scraper, due to: a lower content of volatile solids caused by the biodegradation occurring in the deep pit, and a lower specific biogas production caused by the change in the characteristics of organic <b>matter.</b> <b>Flushing</b> can produce three different fluxes: diluted flushed manure, solid separated manure and liquid separated manure. The diluted fraction appears to be unsuitable for conventional anaerobic digestion in completely stirred reactors (CSTR), since its content of organic matter is too low to be worthwhile. The liquid separated fraction could represent an interesting material, as it appears to accumulate the most biodegradable organic fraction, but not as primary substrate in CSTR as the organic matter concentration is too low. Finally, the solid-liquid separation process tends to accumulate inert matter in the solid separated fraction and, therefore, its specific methane production is low...|$|R
40|$|Senior seminar (D. V. M.) [...] Cornell University, 1999. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf [7]). The {{following is}} a case of fish disease that occurred mid-September 1998 in Canada. The site manager of an Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fish farm called a fish veterinarian to report his concerns. These concerns included gradually increasing mortalities in three of his eight seawater fish pens over the past two weeks. Normally, he expected to have an average of 10 mortalities per day per pen, but the number had increased to an average of 40. He said that the affected fish were lethargic, anorexic, and had a dark body color. The site manager was also worried, because a fish farm one mile away was reportedly having disease problems. Because this histoiy was vague and not indicative of any specific disease, a visit to the farm was scheduled. 	The fish farm was located on a southern bay of Newfoundland. This is a center for salmonid aquaculture, because it has proper water temperatures and good tidal movement to <b>flush</b> away organic <b>matter</b> produced by the fish. The farm itself had eight polar circle pens with nets extending to 20 feet in depth. Each pen included 10 - 15 thousand fish, which had been hatched in a single freshwater hatchery in the spring on 1997. They were transferred to this saltwater site in the spring of 1998 for growout to a weight of 5 - 8 pounds. This population had not suffered any serious outbreaks of disease in that time and had not been exposed to antibiotic treatment...|$|R
40|$|Marine and {{terrestrial}} {{ecosystems are}} connected via transfers of nutrients and organic matter in river discharges. In coastal seas, such freshwater outflows create prominent turbidity plumes. These plumes are areas of high biological {{activity in the}} pelagos, of which zooplankton is a key element. Conceptually, the increased biomass of zooplankton consumers in plumes can be supported by two alternative trophic pathways-consumption of fresh marine phytoplankton production stimulated by riverine nutrients, or direct trophic subsidies through the uptake of terrestrial and estuarine organic <b>matter</b> <b>flushed</b> to sea. The relative importance of these two pathways has not been established previously. Isotopic tracing (carbon and nitrogen) {{was used to measure}} the extent of incorporation of marine versus terrestrial matter into mesozooplankton consumers in the plumes off a small estuary in eastern Australia. Replicate zooplankton samples were taken during baseflow conditions with minimal freshwater influence to the sea, and during pulsed discharge events that generated turbidity plumes in coastal waters. Food sources utilized by zooplankton differed among locations and with the strength of freshwater flow. Terrestrial and estuarine carbon only made a sizeable contribution (47 %) to the carbon demands of zooplankton in the lower estuary during pulsed freshwater flows. By contrast, in plumes that developed in nearshore marine waters, phytoplankton supplied up to 90 % of the dietary carbon of zooplankton feeding in the plumes. Overall, it was "fresh" carbon, fixed by marine phytoplankton, the growth of which became stimulated by fluvial nutrient exports, that dominated energy flows in plume regions. The trophic role of terrestrial and estuarine organic exports was comparatively minor. The trophic dynamics of plankton in small coastal plumes is closely linked to variations in freshwater flow, but this coupling operates mainly through the enhancement of in-situ phytoplankton production rather than cross-boundary transfers of organic matter to marine food webs in the pelagos.

40|$|AbstractWater pulses have a {{significant}} impact on nitrogen (N) cycling, making management of N challenging in agricultural soils that are exposed to episodic rainfall. In hot, dry environments, wetting of dry soil during summer fallow causes a rapid <b>flush</b> of organic <b>matter</b> mineralisation and subsequent nitrification, which may lead to N loss via nitrous oxide emission and nitrate leaching. Here we examined the potential for the nitrification inhibitor nitrapyrin to decrease gross nitrification at elevated temperature in soils with contrasting soil organic matter contents, and the consequent effects on ammonia oxidiser populations. Soil was collected during summer fallow while dry (water content 0. 01  g g− 1 soil) from a research site with two management treatments (tilled soil and tilled soil with long-term additional crop residues) by three field replicates. The field dry soil (0 – 10  cm) was wet with or without nitrapyrin, and incubated (20 or 40  °C) at either constant soil water content or allowed to dry (to simulate summer drying after a rainfall event). Gross N transformation rates and inorganic N pools sizes were determined on six occasions during the 14 day incubation. Bacterial and archaeal amoA gene abundance was determined on days 0, 1, 7 and 14. Nitrapyrin increased ammonium retention and decreased gross nitrification rates even with soil drying at 40  °C. Nitrification was likely driven by bacterial ammonia oxidisers, as the archaeal amoA gene was below detection in the surface soil layer. Bacterial ammonia oxidiser gene abundances were not affected by nitrapyrin, despite the decrease in nitrifier activity. Increased soil organic matter from long-term additional crop residues diminished the effectiveness of nitrapyrin. The present study highlights the potential for nitrapyrin to decrease nitrification and the risk of N loss due to mineralisation of soil organic matter under summer fallow conditions...|$|R
40|$|Submarine canyons {{are large}} geomorphological {{features}} that incise continental shelves and slopes around the world. They are often suggested to be biodiversity and biomass hotspots, {{although there is}} no consensus about this in the literature. Nevertheless, many canyons do host diverse faunal communities but owing to our lack of understanding of the processes shaping and driving this diversity, appropriate management strategies have yet to be developed. Here, we integrate all the current knowledge of one single system, the Whittard Canyon (Celtic Margin, NE Atlantic), including the latest research on its geology, sedimentology, geomorphology, oceanography, ecology, and biodiversity in order to address this issue. The Whittard Canyon is an active system in terms of sediment transport. The net suspended sediment transport is mainly up-canyon causing sedimentary overflow in some upper canyon areas. Occasionally sediment gravity flow events do occur, some possibly the result of anthropogenic activity. However, the role of these intermittent gravity flows in transferring labile organic matter to the deeper regions of the canyon appears to be limited. More likely, any labile organic <b>matter</b> <b>flushed</b> downslope in this way becomes strongly diluted with bulk material and is therefore of little food value for benthic fauna. Instead, the fresh organic matter found in the Whittard Channel mainly arrives through vertical deposition and lateral transport of phytoplankton blooms that occur in the area during spring and summer. The response of the Whittard Canyon fauna to these processes is different in different groups. Foraminiferal abundances are higher in the upper parts of the canyon and on the slope than in the lower canyon. Meiofaunal abundances in the upper and middle part of the canyon are higher than on adjacent slopes, but lower in the deepest part. Mega- and macrofauna abundances are higher in the canyon compared with the adjacent slope and are higher in the eastern than the western branch. These faunal patterns reflect the fact that the Whittard Canyon encompasses considerable environmental heterogeneity, related to a combination of organic matter trapping, current regimes (due to focused internal tides) and different substrates. We conclude that coordinated observations of processes driving faunal patterns are needed at a fine scale {{in order to understand the}} functioning of communities in this and other submarine canyons...|$|R
