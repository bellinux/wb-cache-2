50|$|The use {{of drugs}} among prostitutes is very high. A study was {{conducted}} with 200 street prostitutes to determine when prostitutes first get involved with drugs. The results showed that 55% of the subjects reported becoming addicted to drugs before they became prostitutes, 30% reported becoming addicted after becoming a prostitute, and 15% became addicted {{at the same time they}} became a prostitute. The study also revealed that the women's families often had alcohol and drug abuse throughout their lives. Substance abuse can lead someone towards prostitution and prostitution can lead someone to substance abuse. Prostitutes use many different drugs to help them deal with their problems. Marijauna is used to <b>help</b> <b>relax,</b> heroin is used to help increase emotional and physical stress tolerances, and cocaine and other stimulants are used to increase energy and confidence, so they are able to bring in more clients. When prostitutes use drugs, they often become addicted and have to continue prostituting to continue funding their addiction.|$|E
5000|$|Maternal-Fetal Bonding: Communication {{between the}} mother and fetus is {{essential}} during pregnancy. One way of strengthening the bond {{between the two is}} through music therapy. Music stimulation helps to develop the fetus's nervous system, structurally and functionally. The unborn child especially prefers the voice of their mother. The most effective way to enhance communication is through singing. Lullabies are the most popular songs sung by mothers. Singing lullabies is a wonderful way for mothers to express their love and have the baby become familiarized with their mother's melodies and intonations which will provide them a sense of security when they are born, because it will feel just like how they were in the womb. Electronic voice phenomena {{studies have shown that the}} father's voice engages the fetus from feet to the abdomen - which will lead the baby to start walking at a younger age. The mother's voice engages the fetus from waist to head which will strengthen the baby's neck and upper limbs. Not only does prenatal singing benefit the fetus, it also help produce endorphins that automatically reduce the perception of pain and <b>help</b> <b>relax</b> breathing. A fetus can show preference for music; observations have shown the fetus's movements are gentle when listening to soothing music, and comparatively, where there are dissonances included in the music, their movements are bigger and much more rhythmic, such as rolling. The fetus would be comforted by hearing slow-pace passages of Baroque music (Vivaldi and Handel) and lullabies sung by their mother.|$|E
