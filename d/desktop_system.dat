25|$|On September 30, 2014, Microsoft {{announced}} Windows 10 as {{the successor}} to Windows 8.1. It was released on July 29, 2015, and addresses shortcomings in the user interface first introduced with Windows 8. Changes include {{the return of the}} Start Menu, a virtual <b>desktop</b> <b>system,</b> and the ability to run Windows Store apps within windows on the desktop rather than in full-screen mode. Windows 10 is said to be available to update from qualified Windows 7 with SP1 and Windows 8.1 computers from the Get Windows 10 Application (for Windows 7, Windows 8.1) or Windows Update (Windows 7).|$|E
25|$|These clauses could {{potentially}} outlaw any free software capable of reading DRM-using formats (music, video, or even text content); the {{fear was that}} free software implementing DRM would be construed as facilitating circumvention. Designers of software knowingly facilitating circumvention would, with the initial draft, face felony charges of counterfeiting with a maximum penalty of a €300,000 fine and/or three years in prison. Free software advocates thus concluded that the law would have {{a chilling effect on}} the development of free software in France, since any modern <b>desktop</b> <b>system</b> is {{supposed to be able to}} read music and video content, and their designers could not be sure whether they would face felony charges.|$|E

50|$|All <b>desktop</b> <b>systems</b> must share {{information}} about the user. This is a corollary of the re-apportionment principle. To the extent that <b>desktop</b> <b>systems</b> require user information (such as email address, phone# etc.) it is advantageous for users to have the system obtain it from a common profile.|$|R

500|$|Windows 10 {{introduces}} what Microsoft {{described as}} [...] "universal apps"; expanding on Metro-style apps, these apps {{can be designed}} to run across multiple Microsoft product families with nearly identical codeincluding PCs, tablets, smartphones, embedded systems, Xbox One, Surface Hub and Mixed Reality. The Windows user interface was revised to handle transitions between a mouse-oriented interface and a touchscreen-optimized interface based on available input devicesparticularly on 2-in-1 PCs; both interfaces include an updated Start menu which incorporates elements of Windows 7's traditional Start menu with the tiles of Windows 8. The first release of Windows 10 also introduces a virtual <b>desktop</b> <b>system,</b> a window and desktop management feature called Task View, the Microsoft Edge web browser, support for fingerprint and face recognition login, new security features for enterprise environments, and DirectX 12 and WDDM 2.0 to improve the operating system's graphics capabilities for games.|$|E
500|$|A new {{iteration}} of the Start menu {{is used on}} the Windows 10 desktop, with a list {{of places}} and other options on the left side, and tiles representing applications on the right. The menu can be resized, and expanded into a full-screen display, which is the default option in Tablet mode. A new virtual <b>desktop</b> <b>system</b> was added. A feature known as Task View displays all open windows and allows users to switch between them, or switch between multiple workspaces. Windows Store apps, which previously could be used only in full screen mode, can now be used in self-contained windows similarly to other programs. Program windows can now be snapped to quadrants of the screen by dragging them to the corner. When a window is snapped {{to one side of the}} screen, Task View appears and the user is prompted to choose a second window to fill the unused side of the screen (called [...] "Snap Assist"). Windows' system icons were also changed.|$|E

Compaq, the first IBM PC [...] "clone" [...] manufacturer, produced a <b>desktop</b> <b>system</b> based on the faster 80286 processor in 1985 and in 1986 quickly followed with the first 80386-based system, beating IBM and establishing a competitive market for PC-compatible systems and setting up Intel as a key component supplier.|$|E
