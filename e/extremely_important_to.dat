5|$|The Iazyges' {{trade with}} the Pontic Steppe and Black Sea was <b>extremely</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> their economy. This can {{can be seen in}} one of the {{concessions}} offered to them by Marcus Aurelius after the Marcomannic War, in which he allows the Iazyges to move through Dacia and {{trade with the}} Roxolani, which reconnected them to the Pontic Steppe trade network. This trade route lasted until 260, when the Goths took over Tyras and Olbia, cutting off both the Roxolani and the Iazyges' trade with the Pontic Steppe.|$|E
5|$|For {{purposes}} of geophysical and oceanographic research {{and to determine}} habitability, endurance and psychological stress – all <b>extremely</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the Polaris program – it had been decided that a rapid round-the-world trip, touching the areas of interest, should be conducted. Maximum stability of the observing platform and unbroken continuity around the world were important. Additionally, for reasons of the national interest it had been decided that the voyage should be made entirely submerged undetected by our own or other forces and completed as soon as possible. TRITON, because of her size, speed and extra dependability of her two-reactor plant, had been chosen for the mission.|$|E

GCHQ's Hong Kong operations were <b>extremely</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> {{their relationship with}} the NSA, who contributed investment and equipment to the station. In anticipation of the transfer of Hong Kong to the Chinese government in 1997, the Hong Kong stations operations were moved to Geraldton in Australia.|$|E
25|$|In {{species of}} algae that contain a single chloroplast, {{regulation}} of chloroplast division is <b>extremely</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> ensure that each daughter cell receives a chloroplast—chloroplasts can't {{be made from}} scratch. In organisms like plants, whose cells contain multiple chloroplasts, coordination is looser and less important. It is likely that chloroplast and cell division are somewhat synchronized, though the mechanisms for it are mostly unknown.|$|E

Because it’s <b>extremely</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> {{maintain}} the stable ability of the transgenic plants across different generations. Reporter genes such as GUS and Green Fluorescent Protein(GFP) are utilized in combination with plant selective markers (herbicide, antibody etc.) However, GUS expression depends on the plant development stage and GFP {{may be influenced by}} the green tissue autofluorescence. Quantitative PCR could be an alternative method for chimera detection.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone, {{along with}} its {{metabolite}} dihydrotestosterone, is <b>extremely</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> normal sexual functioning in men and women. Dihydrotestosterone is the most prevalent androgen in both men and women. Testosterone levels in women at age 60 are, on average, about half {{of what they were}} before the women were 40. Although this decline is gradual for most women, those who’ve undergone bilateral oophorectomy experience a sudden drop in testosterone levels; this is because the ovaries produce 40% of the body's circulating testosterone.|$|E

25|$|The {{center of}} the Central region was Mexico City. The {{development}} of Mexico City itself is <b>extremely</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the development of New Spain as a whole. It was {{the seat of the}} Viceroyalty of New Spain, the Archdiocese of the Catholic Church, the Holy Office of the Inquisition, the merchants' guild (consulado), and the most elite families in the Kingdom of New Spain. Mexico City was the single-most populous city, not just in New Spain, but for many years the entire Western Hemisphere, with a high concentration of mixed-race castas. It was the hub of New Spain, the {{center of the}} center.|$|E
25|$|Soil {{respiration}} and its rate across ecosystems is <b>extremely</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> understand. This {{is because}} soil respiration plays {{a large role}} in global carbon cycling as well as other nutrient cycles. The respiration of plant structures releases not only CO2 but also other nutrients in those structures, such as nitrogen. Soil respiration is also associated with positive feedbacks with global climate change. Positive feedbacks are when a change in a system produces response in the same direction of the change. Therefore, soil respiration rates can be effected by climate change and then respond by enhancing climate change.|$|E
25|$|Haury's {{work with}} the Hohokam began in 1930 when he joined Gila Pueblo. There were many {{questions}} surrounding discoveries in southern Arizona beginning with A.V. Kidder in the early 20th century to Harold and Winifred Gladwin's work up through 1930s. One of Haury's first projects after becoming the Assistant director of Gila Pueblo was to investigate a site known as Roosevelt 9:6. The importance of understanding the Hohokam was <b>extremely</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Haury {{and one of his}} most famous projects was at Snaketown where he conducted extensive excavations and on which he eventually wrote a book.|$|E

25|$|N. bombycis kills 100% of {{silkworms}} hatched from infected eggs. This {{disease can}} be carried over from worms to moths, then eggs and worms again. This microsporidium comes from the food the silkworms eat. If silkworms get this disease in their worm stage, no visible symptoms occur. However, mother moths pass the disease to the eggs, and 100% of worms hatching from the diseased eggs will die in their worm stage. To prevent this disease, it is <b>extremely</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> rule out all eggs from infected moths by checking the moth's body fluid under a microscope.|$|E
25|$|Richelieu's successes were <b>extremely</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Louis XIII's successor, King Louis XIV. He {{continued}} Richelieu's work {{of creating}} an absolute monarchy; {{in the same vein}} as the Cardinal, he enacted policies that further suppressed the once-mighty aristocracy, and utterly destroyed all remnants of Huguenot political power with the Edict of Fontainebleau. Moreover, Louis took advantage of his nation's success during the Thirty Years' War to establish French hegemony in continental Europe. Thus, Richelieu's policies were the requisite prelude to Louis XIV becoming the most powerful monarch, and France the most powerful nation, in all of Europe during the late seventeenth century.|$|E
25|$|Crews {{was born}} in {{suburban}} Philadelphia in 1933. Both of his parents were avid readers and were tremendously influential in his life, said Crews; “They had both been raised in considerable poverty, and books had been <b>extremely</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> them personally, in shaping them. My mother was very literary; my father was very scientific. I feel that I got a little something of both sides.” In high school, Crews was co-captain of the tennis team, and for decades he remained an avid skier, hiker, swimmer, and runner. Crews lives in Berkeley with his wife of 57 years, Elizabeth Crews, a photographer who {{was born and raised}} in Berkeley, California. They have two daughters and four grandchildren.|$|E

25|$|This battle {{would become}} <b>extremely</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the Shi'i psyche. The Twelvers {{as well as}} Mustaali Ismāʿīlī still mourn this event during an {{occasion}} known as Ashura. The Nizari Ismāʿīlī, however, do not mourn this {{in the same way}} because of the belief that the light of the Imām never dies but rather passes on to the succeeding Imām, making mourning arbitrary. However, during commemoration they do not have any celebrations in Jamatkhana during Muharram and may have announcements or sessions regarding the tragic events of Karbala. Also individuals may observe Muharram {{in a wide variety of}} ways. This respect for Muharram does not include self-flagellation and beating because they feel that harming one's body is harming a gift from Allah.|$|E

While wearing a VR headset device, the Marines hang suspended from the Paraloft ceiling that resembles the MC-5 Ram Air parachute. Many simulations are factored in this Virtual Reality Parachute Simulation; it allows the Marine to jump at high altitudes and visually check his main canopy for proper deployment, alleviate malfunctions, to cutaway and deploy a reserve parachute, then employ guidance and control to an unmarked drop zone (DZ).|$|E
25|$|Higher {{command and}} unit leadership. An inDuna guided each regiment, and he in turn {{answered}} to senior izinduna who controlled the corps grouping. Overall {{guidance of the}} host was furnished by elder izinduna usually with many years of experience. One {{or more of these}} elder chiefs might accompany a big force on an important mission. Coordination of tactical movements was supplied by the indunas who used hand signals and messengers. Generally before deploying for battle, the regiments were made to squat in a semicircle while these commanders made final assignments and adjustments. Lower level regimental izinduna, like the NCOs of today's armies, and yesterday's Roman centurions, were <b>extremely</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> morale and discipline. Prior to the clash at Isandhlwana for example, they imposed order on the frenzied rush of warriors eager to get at the British, and steadied those faltering under withering enemy fire during the battle.|$|E
