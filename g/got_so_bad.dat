25|$|Compared to the 2011–12 {{team that}} {{finished}} 41–25, the Lakers offense had improved in points per 100 possessions (108.3 vs. 106.0), but their defense underperformed. The team was lacking continuity with the projected starting lineup {{at the beginning}} of the season having played just 117 minutes together, primarily due to injuries. Howard returned the following game as the Lakers won their first game of 2013, stopping their losing streak at six with a 113-93 win over the lowly Cleveland Cavaliers (9–30). In a move to improve the team's defense, D'Antoni began having Bryant guard the opponent's best perimeter player; Bryant was the primary defender on the Cavaliers' Kyrie Irving, who was held to 15 points. Bryant acknowledged he was a more focused defender when he had a challenging defensive assignment as opposed to when he played off the ball against weaker players. His defense disrupted opponents and freed Nash from unfavorable matchups. In addition to his leg injury, World Peace also suffered an injury to his right arm that made it difficult to bend. Things <b>got</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad,</b> D'Antoni moved him off the perimeter on defense and had him guard power forwards instead.|$|E

Iommi believed the only options available were to fire Osbourne or break the band up completely. [...] "At that time, Ozzy had come to an end", Iommi said. [...] "We were all doing a lot of drugs, a lot of coke, a lot of everything, and Ozzy was getting drunk so much at the time. We were supposed to be rehearsing and nothing was happening.

Amandala dedicated much of the next three years to weaning the young radio station and protecting it from its rivals, the now defunct Radio Belize and LOVE FM. UBAD celebrated what would have been its twenty-second anniversary in 1991, and Amandala publisher and former UBAD president Hyde wrote a reminisce of the UBAD glory days in the [...] "From the Publisher" [...] column of February 8, 1991.

[...] "It's incredible to me that someone can do what was done to us and we have an absolute identification" [...] of the location of the jamming, said Schuman. [...] "I can't speak for Chris, but I feel pretty strongly that we don't want to let them get away with it. We don't want to let it end here," [...] he said. Rosenberg denied knowledge about the phone jamming. [...] "I don't know anything about it.

Rosenberg posited that the Cox campaign was requested police look into the matter as a tactic to discourage him from attempting a write-in-campaign against Cox in the November general election for Congress. According to the Orange County Deputy District Attorney, the phone calls were traced to a residence owned by Rosenberg supporters.

Winner also features some French vocals in the song Tu as Gache Mon Talent Ma Cherie - in true Big Boss Man style, the only lyrics are those {{in the title of}} the song.
