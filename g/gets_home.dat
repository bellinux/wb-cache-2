25|$|The ALCS and NLCS, {{since the}} {{expansion}} to best-of-seven, are always {{played in a}} 2–3–2 format: Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 are played in the stadium {{of the team that}} has home field advantage, and Games 3, 4, and 5 are played in the stadium of the team that does not. The series concludes when one team records its fourth win. Since 1998, home field advantage has been given to the team that has the better regular season record, unless that team happens to be the Wild Card team. In that case, the other team <b>gets</b> <b>home</b> field advantage, because by rule the Wild Card team is never allowed home field advantage in a Division Series or LCS. In the event that both teams have identical records in the regular season, home field advantage goes to the team that has the winning head-to-head record. From 1969 to 1993, home field advantage alternated between the two divisions, and from 1995 to 1997 home field advantage was determined before the season.|$|E

Deirdre Sheppard from Common Sense Media rated it three out of five stars and noted that it has [...] "no educational content"; however, she also said that [...] "other than the mildest of mild violence, and the characters' tendency to poke fun at each other, the series is fun and inoffensive".|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons was {{the first}} {{successful}} animated program in American prime time since Wait Till Your Father <b>Gets</b> <b>Home</b> in the 1970s. During most of the 1980s, US pundits considered animated shows as appropriate only for children, and animating a show was too expensive to achieve a quality suitable for prime-time television. The Simpsons changed this perception, initially leading to a short period where networks attempted to recreate prime-time cartoon success with shows like Capitol Critters, Fish Police, and Family Dog, which were expensive and unsuccessful. The Simpsons use of Korean animation studios for tweening, coloring, and filming made the episodes cheaper. The success of The Simpsons and the lower production cost prompted US television networks to take chances on other animated series. This development led US producers to a 1990s boom in new, animated prime-time shows, such as South Park, Family Guy, King of the Hill, Futurama and The Critic. For Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, [...] "The Simpsons created an audience for prime-time animation {{that had not been}} there for many, many years... As far as I'm concerned, they basically re-invented the wheel. They created what is in many ways—you could classify it as—a wholly new medium." ...|$|E

They have a good time until Artie tricks Marge into making out with him against her will in a re-enactement of their prom during the 1970s made to mirror the one they attended in [...] "The Way We Was" [...] (with even its original attendants who were paid by Artie to show up disguised as they were at that time). Homer, having just anxiously arrived to check up on them, sees Artie kissing an unwilling Marge and, unaware of the true premises, is devastated, and leaves with Lenny away from Springfield. Lenny seems similarly dejected about his relationship with Carl; he and Homer get a job in an oil field in West Springfield, a likely death spot for the two of them. On the way there, they discuss the loves they left behind. All cacti resemble Marge to Homer, and Lenny mournfully points out the image of Carl that he carved on a mountain one blissful summer.

500|$|The {{story is}} about {{a little boy who}} leaves his home with his dog to shop for food items for his mother, and {{attempts}} to remember the list of things she wanted him to buy. [...] The original request from his mother is [...] "six farm eggs, a cake for tea, a pound of pears, and don't forget the bacon." [...] Along with the dog, he is accompanied on his trip by a butterfly. In order to avoid forgetting items, the boy recites his mother's list to himself. Throughout his trip to the store, the boy sees items along the way that play tricks with his memory, and items on his list one-by-one become substituted with other goods. [...] "Six farm eggs" [...] initially becomes [...] "Six fat legs" [...] then [...] "Six clothes pegs", and [...] "A cake for tea" [...] initially becomes [...] "A cape for me" [...] then [...] "A rake for leaves", and [...] "A pound of pears" [...] initially becomes [...] "A flight of stairs" [...] then [...] "A pile of chairs". By the end of his trip, the boy has forgotten the initial items requested, and supplants them in his mind with [...] "Six clothes pegs, a rake for leaves, a pile of chairs, and don't forget the bacon". Then he goes to the junk shop and says to a merchant there, [...] "Six clothes pegs, a rake for leaves, and a pile of chairs please!". The merchant in the junk shop assists the boy in compiling to this odd list. While travelling back to his home, he remembers the original items and corrects his mistakes. Then on the way home, he says to himself, [...] "Six farm eggs, a cake for tea, and a pound of pears".

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on March 3, 1911. The Billboards reviewer gave a positive review and asserted, [...] "Any motion picture in which the views of 'back on the stage' are shown possesses {{a certain degree of}} interest. The ever-curious public is fascinated by the alluring stories of the stage world, and any peep it is given into this realm is welcomed. Because of this, Stage Struck derives the interest it has. As far as the story is concerned there is no special recommendation for it. ... The theatre settings are about as faithful depictions of stage scenes as are found in motion pictures. The player portraying the role of the leading actor very much exaggerates in makeup. The photography is very good." [...] Both the The Morning Telegraph and The New York Dramatic Mirror thought the conclusion was impossible turn of events. The Telegraphs reviewer wrote, [...] "An excellent opportunity was sadly missed for the exposition of a strong lesson to the uninitiated girl or boy who dreams of a career before the footlights. How any author or producer could permit such an impossible ending is a wonder. Can any sensible person imagine a New York manager offering an inexperienced amateur a leading part in a Broadway production? Yet this is what occurs in this tale of a stage-struck miss who joins a repertoire company, is stranded, <b>gets</b> <b>home</b> through the generosity of a traveling salesman and then, with no lapse of time or experience noted, receives a letter with such an offer! Most of the play was well put on and ably acted. The 'star' of the theatrical company wore an abominable wig, which could be distinguished as false. More care and thought would have made this an admirable offering." [...] The Mirror reviewer stated, [...] "The production leaves the impression of being exceedingly well done, but to the average actor the New York engagement, after forsaking her barnstorming company of players, seems somewhat of a dream. It was also startling to see her playing Ophelia after such a flat failure at the previous rehearsal where another took her place." [...] According to the synopsis, it is likely that this New York production in which she foresees herself on stage as Ophelia is a dream because it is prompted by the two letters she received at home.|$|E
