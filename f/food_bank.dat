40|$|Hundreds of {{thousands}} of tons of food are either lost or wasted while millions of people suffer from malnutrition. A plausible initiative are the <b>food</b> <b>banks</b> in which large retail chains and potentially other organizations can donate food. This food is collected and delivered by <b>food</b> <b>banks</b> to people in need. Such <b>food</b> <b>banks</b> have helped thousands of people but still the percentages are negligible as compared to the large quantities of food that are wasted with no more reason that destroying is cheaper. On the other hand, <b>food</b> <b>banks</b> have also their own problems: Poor distribution strategies, informality in handling and delivering food, lack of infrastructure, the mismatch between the supply and nutrition needs, among others. As consequence, research and actions are needed to improve the efficiency of <b>food</b> <b>banks...</b>|$|R

5|$|The twin {{impacts of}} hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel {{prompted}} officials in Mexico {{to declare a}} state of emergency in 155municipalities in Veracruz, Tamaulipas, Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Chihuahua. The nation's Health Ministry sent medical crews across the country to affected areas in an effort {{to prevent the spread of}} disease; the agency also suggested residents boil their water. Officials opened shelters in Tamaulipas for residents whose houses were damaged, housing about 2,000people in the weeks following the storm. The Mexican <b>food</b> <b>bank</b> sent about 800tons of food to the hardest-hit parts of the country in Guerrero, Veracruz, and Sinaloa. In addition, the Mexican Red Cross delivered 186tons of food to Veracruz alone. Volunteers delivered about 600blankets and various cleaning supplies to the town of Pánuco. Following the storms, the National Civil Protection Coordination received the authority to prevent housing construction in areas at risk for mudslides and flooding; the law had passed in 2012, but initially lacked the authority to enforce it. Some residents in Tamaulipas complained at the slow pace of receiving aid. In response, the Gulf Cartel brought relief items to Aldama, with one columnist for El Universal suggesting that this was to gain favor with local residents.|$|E

40|$|<b>Food</b> <b>banks</b> make up an {{increasing}} phenomenon of nonprofit organizations answering to new social needs {{related to the}} global socioeconomic crisis. In order to explore if they are suitably adapting to their environments in Spain, one of the countries most seriously affected by the crisis in South Europe, this work assumes a hybrid qualitative–quantitative structure composed of an exploratory case study based on semi-structured interviews followed by a survey addressed to all the Spanish <b>food</b> <b>banks.</b> Much of the academic literature has concerned the appropriateness of <b>food</b> <b>banks</b> as a delivery mechanism {{in the context of}} welfare state withdrawal. This paper takes this in a different direction by examining Spanish <b>food</b> <b>banks</b> from an organizational management point of view. Wary of concerns about the institutionalization of food charity, on the one hand, and recognizing the escalating daily reliance on <b>food</b> <b>banks,</b> on the other, this paper seeks to address potential technical supply problems and challenges <b>food</b> <b>banks</b> face and open debate about the organizational networks of <b>food</b> <b>banks</b> more generally. The results show nonprofit entities based on a voluntary workforce who run supply chains in order to join both social and business targets. Their situation, performance, resources, mutual relationships and the links with other entities are described, paying special attention to the changes induced by the latest contextual changes. In short, <b>food</b> <b>banks</b> are efficiently organized and well established in their territories as a coherent social movement, although they should improve in their strategic view, coordination, resources and sources of these, to satisfy more adequately their increasingly complex demands...|$|R
