40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the extent of}} financial losses or leakages in the federal-state system of unemployment insurance (UI) in the United States. "Leakages " or "losses " will be used interchangeably to refer to funds due the UI system that it failed to receive, benefits <b>wrongly</b> <b>paid</b> out, and other resources lost. Where possible, the chapter attempts to distinguish losses resulting from intentional (fraudulent) actions by claimants, employers and UI agency staff from those occurring for nonfraudulent reasons. The UI system is a major social insurance program in the United States. In fiscal year (FY) 1995, a year of relatively low unemploy ment, total UI program benefit payments amounted to $ 21 billion, state tax collections (contributions) were $ 23 billion, federal collections for various federal and federal-state extended benefit programs and admin istration were $ 5. 5 billion, and allocations to state employment secu rity agencies (SESAs) for administration were $ 3. 6 billion.

50|$|Target Holdings Ltd gave £1,525,000 to Redferns solicitors, {{ultimately}} to be loaned to Crowngate Developments Ltd to buy property at 60-64 Great Hampton Street, Hockley.

Until then, the solicitors were to hold the money on trust for Target Holdings Ltd. Crowngate, however, had orchestrated a scheme to make a fraudulent profit on the property which it was actually buying at £775,000, while reporting the purchase was for £2m. Breaching {{the terms of the}} agreement, Redferns in fact released £1,490,000 to a company called Panther Ltd before the purchase was completed. The sale went through, but the venture {{turned out to be a}} flop. Crowngate failed to repay the loan, and went into liquidation, meaning that Target Holdings Ltd only ever recovered £500,000 from the sale of the property. Target Holdings Ltd sued Redferns solicitors, arguing that it had a duty to account for the money it had <b>wrongly</b> <b>paid</b> away. Redferns argued that, even though it had breached the trust, this had nothing to do with the loss that Target Holdings Ltd had incurred. The loss was not caused by the breach.|$|R

The same position has generally spread in banking practice globally, and Parliament has not yet taken the opportunity to ensure banks offer accounts where customer money is protected as property. Because insolvent banks do not, governments have found it necessary to publicly guarantee depositors' savings. This follows the model, started in the Great Depression, the US set up the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to prevent bank runs. In 2017, the UK guaranteed deposits up to £85,000, mirroring an EU wide minimum guarantee of €100,000. Moreover, because of the knock-on consequences of any bank failure, because bank debts are locked into a network of international finance, government has found it practically necessary to prevent banks going insolvent. Under the Banking Act 2009 if a bank is going into insolvency, the government may (and usually will if [...] "the stability of the financial systems" [...] is at stake) pursue one of three [...] "stabilisation options". The Bank of England will either try to ensure the failed bank is sold onto another private sector purchaser, set up a subsidiary company to run the failing bank's assets (a [...] "bridge-bank"), or for the UK Treasury to directly take shares in [...] "temporary public ownership". This will wipe out the shareholders, but will keep creditors' claims in tact. One method to prevent bank insolvencies, following the [...] "Basel III" [...] programme of the international banker group, has been to require banks hold more money in reserve based on how risky their lending is. EU wide rules in the Capital Requirements Regulation 2013 achieve this in some detail, for instance requiring proportionally less in reserves if sound government debt is held, but more if mortgage-backed securities are held.|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis concerns proceedings {{dealing with}} regressive compensations in health insurance, that {{is guided by}} law No. 187 / 2006 Coll. about health insurance. The regressive compensation as such takes place when a certain person causes, by his or hers unlawful action, as found by court or other authority, a reason for amount of compensation to another person and is obliged to reimburse the health insurance institution by a prescribed amount. Most often this {{is a result of}} traffic accidents, less frequently as a result of physical attacks or fights. The amount that is prescribed as a reimbursement is determined by the actual compensation paid. Together with proceedings about being ordered to pay this regressive compensation, there are other preceedings also concerning regressive compensations, such as pardoning of this regressive payment in which it has been decide for the benefit of concerned person only for reasons defined by law, such as immediate danger of his malnourishment. Also, the proceedings may start about the person being allowed to pay by instalments. This may permit the person to pay a certain amounts at certain conditions as prescribed by the decision. The law also permits cancellation of this insatllment payments option, when the agreed upon conditions are not met. This is a relatively new system that is relatively welcomed by the organs of health insurance, mainly because of the recovery of a certain amount that had been previously <b>wrongly</b> <b>paid.</b> This work is divided into five chapters, dealing with individual components concerning regressive compensation and their relevant proceedings. The first chapter of this work is focused on general information cocerning health insurance. It is divided at several subchapters, dealing with law status, basic principles, subjects of health insurance, group of insured persons, institutional security and a very important subchapter, which is important just for determination of regressive compensations, such as the amount of health insurance and tied to it, the health status determined by an involved physician or medical adjudicating comission. The second chapter deals with proceedings about regressive compensations in health insurance, description of its various stages, such as the commencement, pausing and stopping of the procedure, including the issuance of the decisision and eventual appelation. Included is also a basic information about the pinciples and subjects of these proceedings. Tied to this are the relevant rules and processes that are part of lawful relationships in health insurance, being governed by law No. 500 / 2005 Coll. about administrative rule, unless set by later rules No. 187 / 2006 Coll. about health insurance, otherwise. The result of these proceedings is the issuance of the decision, including the entitlement and the amount. The third chapter analyses various types of regressive compensations, such as the pardoning of the regressive compensation, allowing to pay by installments and cancellation of this option. The fourth chapter gives the statistical survey about the development of regressive compensations since their establishment on Jannuary 1, 2009, when the determination § 126 was created. Statistical tables show numerical data about the number of issued decisions and the amounts of compensations in each individual year. The fifth and final chapter contains the closing comments on the topic and suggests possible improvements of practical usage. The aim of this thesis is the analysis and the clearest possible description and definition of the valid law modification, focused on regressive compensations in health insurance, so that it, together with the literature cited, could serve as a source of information, or improve the orientation of eventual direct or indirect participants of these proceedings...|$|R
40|$|The Federal Government’s {{decision}} to make changes to how FBT claims are processed was prompted {{by the desire to}} ensure that the transition to a floating Carbon Price (earlier than planned) had a neutral effect on the budget. Those who seek to claim FBT will now have to keep records for 12 weeks over the period of 5 years – to prove, as their claim for FBT infers, that they are using their car for business purposes. Up until the change was announced a person could make a claim for FBT without actually demonstrating or being required to demonstrate that the car in question was being used for business purposes. Surely this is to be welcomed. It will mean that if a person has been claiming FBT improperly in the past, it will be harder {{to do so in the}} future. However the {{decision to}} bring greater integrity to the taxation system has not been universally welcomed.   A coalition of car manufacturers, car leasing companies and salary packaging industry representatives are seeking a meeting with the Federal Government to discuss the recent announcement regarding the FBT. They are concerned that the decision to improve the integrity of the taxation system could have dire and unintended consequences to the car manufacturing industry and in turn the car leasing and salary packaging industries. The most dramatic effects of the change to FBT claims are said to foretell the loss of jobs and the death of several interrelated industry, but are these claims well founded? I am not in a position to make a determination. However what is clear is that any calls for the Federal Government not to implement the proposed changes cannot be entertained. If the Federal Government’s announcements are accurate, it is expected that the change will provide savings of $ 1. 8 b. In other words FBT claims of $ 1. 8 bn are <b>wrongly</b> being <b>paid</b> out. Surely we cannot simply ignore this misappropriation? In seeking to answer this question we cannot ignore the fact that it comes amidst ongoing community discussion as the future of the car manufacturing industry in Australia. These discussions have highlighted the existence of two, diametrically opposed groups; those who would remove all tariffs and government assistance packages that seek to prevent the demise of the car manufacturing industry and those who support the status quo.   What the latest manifestation of this discussion highlights is that as a community we have a choice to make; do we protect or do we support our car manufacturing industry? Some may think that the difference between ‘protect’ and ‘support’ is merely semantics. Although the words are similar, and may be used interchangeably in some situations, a clear difference can be substantiated for present purposes. To ‘protect’ denotes a lack of agency on the part of the car manufacturing industry; it is a passive recipient, not required to respond to market changes or conduct research and development. In contrast, support requires the car industry to evolve, to conduct research and development and ultimately respond to market changes. The former is infinite in its duration, the latter is finite. The car manufacturing assistance package agreed to by car industry representatives and governments has not conclusively resolved the stance that has be taken: to protect or to support. The fact that the package is to have a lifetime of ten years and requires car manufactures to make a corresponding investment would seem to suggest that the approach we tend to favour is one of support. What we have before us is a chance to resolve the ambiguity that surrounds our approach to the car manufacturing industry. If we are to protect the industry, then the proposed changes to FBT should be reversed. Yet, if it is our desire to support the industry, then the changes should proceed as planned. In resolving this ambiguity much has to be borne in mind. A decision to protect the car manufacturing industry involves both financial and non-financial costs. Government assistance packages have an obvious financial cost, and this may grow as competitors invest in research and development and our car industry remains static. Further there is the opportunity cost; the cost associated with not being able to spend the money that provides for the government assistance package on something else. Perhaps that same money could have been spent on building a new industry: an industry that does not require constant government assistance packages? But there are also costs associated with deciding to support, rather than to protect the car manufacturing industry. Support, by its very nature, is to be finite. Thus our decision to support may require us to let the car manufacturing industry cease to play a major role in our economy. Now the obvious ramification of that will be a loss of jobs, both directly and indirectly. There will be a direct loss of employment with the car manufacturers themselves. The indirect loss of employment will come with the lost of employment in the industries and workplaces that support the car manufacturers. Further there is the ramifications that the loss of employment will have on the communities in which these workplaces, factories and employees are located. The families of the former employees will experience a significant decline in their spending power and hence a corresponding decline in spending and employment in local shops, businesses and services can also be expected to follow suit. Losses in employment can also be expected to attract a greater demand for support in the community in the form of unemployment benefits: adding greater strain to our public budgets. If this does eventuate, then we may also expect to see an increase in family stress, family breakdown, poor health outcomes, and ultimately community dissociation. Now many of theses costs may not eventuate, or at least eventuate to that extreme. However what it does demonstrate is that we have to be acutely aware as to the ramifications of any decision regarding our car manufacturing industry. The Federal Government announcement on FBT is greater than simply a discussion on the Carbon Price or the integrity on the taxation system. The decision provides a watershed moment, a chance to resolve the ambiguity that surrounds our car manufacturing industry. Some may wish bury their head in the sand, whilst others may claim that the dire predictions made by industry representatives are baseless. Neither are acceptable stances to take. Whilst the ambiguity provides that either a protective or supportive approach to the car manufacturing industry remain possible, this scenario comes with costs and risks. The longer we wait, the more limited the opportunities for action become. If our approach is to be one of support, as it seems, then this should be made known now. Although it may preordain the end of the car manufacturing industry, it also provides ample time to support the creation of a new manufacturing industry, new employment and community stability. Surely this is better than the ambiguity that currently surrounds our car industry. Photo Credit: RaeAllen via Compfight c...|$|R
