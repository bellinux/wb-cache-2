40|$|The Saturn Electronics & Engineering, Inc. (Saturn) {{facility}} in Marks, Miss., that produces lamp assemblies was experiencing itermittent problems with its automotive {{under the hood}} lamps. After numerous testing and engineering efforts, technicians could not pin down {{the root of the}} problem. So Saturn contacted the NASA Technology Assistance Program (TAP) at Stennis Space Center. The Marks production facility had been experiencing intermittent problems with under the <b>hood</b> <b>lamp</b> assemblies for some time. The failure rate, at 2 percent, was unacceptable. Every effort was made to identify the problem so that corrective action could be put in place. The problem was investigated and researched by Saturn's engineering department. In addition, Saturn brought in several independent testing laboratories. Other measures included examining the switch component suppliers and auditing them for compliance to the design specifications and for surface contaminants. All attempts to identify the factors responsible for the failures were inconclusive. In an effort to get to the root of the problem, and at the recommendation of the Mississippi Department of Economic Development, Saturn contacted the NASA TAP at Stennis. The NASA Materials and Contamination Laboratory, with assistance from the Stennis Prototype Laboratory, conducted a materials evaluation study on the switch components. The laboratory findings showed the failures were caused by a build-up of carbon-based contaminants on the switch components. Saturn Electronics & Engineering, Inc., is a minority-owned provider of contract manufacturing services to a diverse global marketplace. Saturn operates manufacturing facilities globally serving the North American, European, and Asian markets. Saturn's production {{facility in}} Marks, Mississippi, produces more than 1, 000, 000 lamps and switches monthly. "Since the NASA recommendations were implemented, our internal failure rate for intermittency has dropped to less than. 02 percent. Most importantly, we restored our high-level of customer satisfaction. Stennis provided an invaluable service to our business," Patrick said. Both NASA and Saturn were pleased with the results form this technical assistance project. The Technology Assistance Program at Stennis makes available to the public NASA technical expertise and access to lab facilities. This project provided both services with a positive outcome...|$|E
2500|$|The 1974 Ninety-Eight was now Oldsmobile's longest running series {{dating back}} to 1941, and was still popular.

40|$|At its core, {{the field}} of {{microbial}} experimental evolution seeks to elucidate the natural laws governing the history of microbial life by understanding its underlying driving mechanisms. However, observing evolution in nature is complex, as environmental conditions are difficult to control. Laboratory-based experiments for observing population evolution provide more control, but manually culturing and studying multiple generations of microorganisms can be time consuming, labor intensive, and prone to inconsistency. We have constructed a prototype, closed system device that automates the process of directed evolution experiments in microorganisms. It is compatible with any liquid microbial culture, including polycultures and field samples, provides flow control and adjustable agitation, continuously monitors optical density (OD), and can dynamically control environmental pressures such as ultraviolet-C (UV-C) radiation and temperature. Here, {{the results of the}} prototype are compared to iterative exposure and survival assays conducted using a traditional <b>hood,</b> UV-C <b>lamp,</b> and shutter system...|$|R
5000|$|In December 1914, a V8 was {{introduced}} in the King, a scant two months after Cadillac announced its own V8-powered car. Starting in 1916, all Kings were 8-cylinder models. Production declined from a peak of 3000 in 1916 to a company low of 240 in 1923. During the more healthy years, the company exported cars to Europe, Australia, South America, South Africa, and Russia. [...] Early 4-cylinder cars sold for $1350 in basic form, and for $1565 when fully equipped with windshield, <b>hood,</b> and gas <b>lamps.</b> By 1914, even the V8-powered car was only $1350, and was advertised as the [...] "World's First Popular-Priced V8".

50|$|Harold Dew {{left the}} company in February 1914 {{and set up a}} new concern at Charlotte Place, Clapham, London {{registered}} as D.U. Manufacturing Co making a car called the D'Ultra. This was available as either a two-seat car or delivery van and used a water-cooled Chater-Lea 8 hp 50-degree V-twin engine with 4-speed friction transmission. This transmission involved a prop-shaft to which was attached a friction disc driving a countershaft and thence by a single roller chain to the cantilever sprung rear axle, which was not fitted with a differential. The front suspension was by a transverse semi-elliptic leaf spring, and the steering was of the rack and pinion type. As was common with cycle cars the braking was only on the rear wheels, and while this was initially described as being both by internal expanding and contracting types operating on two drums the reality was rather different (see below). The ladder frame is described as being 'made of re-inforced ash, and is of quite simple design with only three cross-members'. Price was £115 complete with head <b>lamps,</b> <b>hood,</b> and wind screen.|$|R

60|$|When {{the night}} was far advanced, Mary awoke with a sudden start. A vivid dream had latterly {{involved}} her in its unreal life, of which, however, she could only remember {{that it had been}} broken in upon at the most interesting point. For a little time, slumber hung about her like a morning mist, hindering her from perceiving the distinct outline of her situation. She listened with imperfect consciousness to two or three volleys of a rapid and eager knocking; and first she deemed the noise a matter of course, like the breath she drew; next, it appeared a thing in which she had no concern; and lastly, she became aware that it was a summons necessary to be obeyed. At the same moment, the pang of recollection darted into her mind; the pall of sleep was thrown back from the face of grief; the dim light of the chamber, and the objects therein revealed, had retained all her suspended ideas, and restored them as soon as she unclosed her eyes. Again there was a quick peal upon the street-door. Fearing that her sister would also be disturbed, Mary wrapped herself in a cloak and <b>hood,</b> took the <b>lamp</b> from the hearth, and hastened to the window. By some accident, it had been left unhasped, and yielded easily to her hand.|$|R
40|$|The mining {{industry}} {{is among the}} top ten industries nationwide with high occupational injury and fatality rates, and mine rescue response may be {{considered one of the}} most hazardous activities in mining operations. In the aftermath of an underground mine fire, explosion or water inundation, specially equipped and trained teams have been sent underground to fight fires, rescue entrapped miners, test atmospheric conditions, investigate the causes of the disaster, or recover the dead. Special personal protective ensembles are used by the team members to improve the protection of rescuers against the hazards of mine rescue and recovery. Personal protective ensembles used by mine rescue teams consist of helmet, cap <b>lamp,</b> <b>hood,</b> gloves, protective clothing, boots, kneepads, facemask, breathing apparatus, belt, and suspenders. While improved technology such as wireless warning and communication systems, lifeline pulleys, and lighted vests have been developed for mine rescuers over the last 100 years, recent research in this area of personal protective ensembles has been minimal due to the trending of reduced exposure of rescue workers. In recent years, the exposure of mine rescue teams to hazardous situations has been changing. However, it is vital that members of the teams have the capability and proper protection to immediately respond to a wide range of hazardous situations. Currently, there are no minimum requirements, best practice documents, or nationally recognized consensus standards for protective clothing used by mine rescue teams in the United States (U. S.). The following review provides a summary of potential issues that can be addressed by rescue teams and industry to improve potential exposures to rescue team members should a disaster situation occur. However, the continued trending in the {{mining industry}} toward non-exposure to potential hazards for rescue workers should continue to be the primary goal. To assist in continuing this trend, the mining industry and regulatory agencies have been more restrictive by requiring additional post disaster information regarding atmospheric conditions and other hazards before exposing rescue workers and others in the aftermath of a mine disaster. In light of some of the more recent mine rescuer fatalities such as the Crandall Canyon Mine and Jim Walters Resources in the past years, the direction of reducing exposure is preferred. This review provides a historical perspective on ensembles used during mine rescue operations and summarizes environmental hazards, critical elements of mine rescue ensembles, and key problems with these elements. This study also identifies domains for improved mine rescue ensembles. Furthermore, field observations from several coal mine rescue teams were added to provide the information on the currently used mine rescue ensembles in the U. S.
