2500|$|In a 2009 U.S. Open {{semifinal}} round against Kim Clijsters, Williams slammed her racquet on {{the court}} after losing the first set. She was given a warning, with a potential second violation carrying a one-point penalty. While trailing 4–6, 5–6, 15–30, Williams's second serve was called a foot fault, resulting in two match points for Clijsters. Williams <b>gestured</b> <b>with</b> her racquet to the lineswoman {{who had made the}} call and yelled at her, with profanities and a threat to shove a tennis ball down the lineswoman's throat. During the subsequent on-court conference between the chair umpire, the lineswoman, US Open officials, and Williams, a television microphone picked up Williams saying to the lineswoman, [...] "I didn't say I would kill you! Are you serious?" [...] The incident resulted in Williams being penalized a point for unsportsmanlike conductnecessitated by the earlier warning for racquet abusemeaning Clijsters won the match 64, 75. The following day, Williams was issued the maximum permissible on-site fine of $10,000 (plus $500 for racquet abuse). After further investigation, the Grand Slam Committee in November 2009 fined her $175,000 in lieu of suspending her from the 2010 US Open or other Grand Slam events. They also placed her on a two-year probation, so if Williams committed another offense in the following two years at a Grand Slam tournament, she would be suspended from participating in the following US Open. If she committed no offenses in the next two years, her fine would be reduced to $82,500. Williams initially refused to apologize for her outburst, both in her post-match press conference and in an official statement released the following day. She eventually apologized stating [...] "I just really wanted to apologize sincerely, because I'm a very prideful person and I'm a very intense person and a very emotional person", and [...] "I wanted to offer my sincere apologies to anyone that I may have offended." [...] She said she had been humbled by the experience.|$|E

60|$|Just {{how much}} she didn't really like her {{children}} she presently realized when in the feeble irascibility of their sickness they fell quarrelling. They became--horrid. Millicent and Annette being imprisoned in their beds it seemed good to Florence {{when she came back}} from the morning's walk, to annex and hide a selection of their best toys. She didn't take them and play with them, she hid them with an industrious earnestness in a box window-seat that was regarded as peculiarly hers, staggering with armfuls across the nursery floor. Then Millicent by some equally mysterious agency divined what was afoot and set up a clamour for a valued set of doll's furniture, which immediately provoked a similar outcry from little Annette for her Teddy Bear. Followed woe and uproar. The invalids insisted upon having every single toy they possessed brought in and put upon their beds; Florence was first disingenuous and then surrendered her loot with passionate howlings. The Teddy Bear was rescued from Baby after a violent struggle in which one furry hind leg was nearly twisted off. It jars upon the philoprogenitive sentiment of our time to tell of these things and still more to record that all four, stirred by possessive passion to the profoundest depths of their beings, betrayed to an unprecedented degree in their little sharp noses, their flushed faces, their earnest eyes, their dutiful likeness to Sir Isaac. He peeped from under Millicent's daintily knitted brows and <b>gestured</b> <b>with</b> Florence's dimpled fists. It was as if God had tried to make him into four cherubim and as if in spite of everything he was working through.|$|E
40|$|Although {{manipulating}} 3 D virtual models <b>with</b> mid-air hand <b>gestures</b> had {{the benefits}} of natural interactions and free from the sanitation problems of touch surfaces, many factors could influence the usability of such an interaction paradigm. In this research, the authors conducted experiments to study the vision-based mid-air hand gestures for scaling, translating, and rotating a 3 D virtual car displayed on a large screen. An Intel RealSense 3 D Camera was employed for hand gesture recognition. The two-hand <b>gesture</b> <b>with</b> grabbing then moving apart/close to each other was applied to enlarging/shrinking the 3 D virtual car. The one-hand <b>gesture</b> <b>with</b> grabbing then moving was applied to translating a car component. The two-hand <b>gesture</b> <b>with</b> grabbing and moving relatively along the circumference of a horizontal circle was applied to rotating the car. Seventeen graduate students {{were invited to participate}} in the experiments and offer their evaluations and comments for gesture usability. The results indicated that the width and depth of detection ranges were the key usability factors for two-hand <b>gestures</b> <b>with</b> linear motions. For dynamic <b>gestures</b> <b>with</b> quick transitions and motions from open to close hand poses, ensuring gesture recognition robustness was extremely important. Furthermore, given a <b>gesture</b> <b>with</b> ergonomic postures, inappropriate control-response ratio could result in fatigue due to repetitive exertions of hand gestures for achieving the precise controls of 3 D model manipulation tasks...|$|R

As he was giving the order however, Tsobari pushed the terrorists weapon aside and dashed down a flight of steps into the underground car park, pursued by a terrorist who shot two or three rounds at the fleeing Tsobari. Tsobari carried on sprinting for seventy metres until he came to the Olympic Village fence which he jumped over and ran into the nearby Olympic press center. He was ignored for the first few seconds until taking a journalist aside and calmly explaining what had happened and who he was. After being escorted under police guard, Tsobari found a woman that spoke Hebrew and German.

This resulted in gasps in the audience and one woman stood up to condemn her.

Later, she clarified her comments: [...] "Nobody is saying a person going hungry is a good thing and everything must be done to stop this. Whilst we work to eradicate hunger however the food banks themselves do provide a good service". After her re-election, Murray called for greater regulation of social media content and protection of MPs from intimidation after claiming that during the campaign she was personally subjected to sustained abuse from users on social media.|$|E

50|$|After his Formula One {{debut at}} the 1973 British Grand Prix, Williamson's second Formula One {{appearance}} {{was at the}} 1973 Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort Circuit. On his eighth lap, a suspected tyre failure caused his car to flip upside down and catch fire. Williamson had not been seriously injured by the impact, but was trapped under the car which was swiftly engulfed in flame. The track marshals were both poorly trained and badly equipped, and did not assist him. Another driver, David Purley, upon witnessing the crash of his friend, abandoned his own race and pulled over in a desperate and valiant attempt to rescue Williamson. He ran across the track to Williamson's car and tried to turn it upright, before grabbing a fire extinguisher from a marshal and returning to the engulfed car. He emptied it on the car and signalled for others to help. Purley's efforts to turn the car upright and extinguish the flames were in vain, and the marshals were unable to handle the vehicle without flame retardant overalls. Purley later stated he could hear Williamson's screams from underneath the car, {{but by the time}} the first fire engine arrived and the fire was extinguished, Williamson had died of asphyxiation. As most racers mistakenly identified Purley as the driver of the crashed car, and therefore thought the burning car to be empty, none of them stopped to help and the race continued, even as Purley stood on the circuit and <b>gestured</b> <b>with</b> his hands for them to stop. Furthermore, the track marshals were wearing normal blazers and not the fire-resistant overalls which the drivers wore, and thus were not willing to go near the large flames. Purley was later awarded the George Medal for the bravery he displayed in attempting to rescue Williamson. A series of photos of the incident, showing a clearly desperate and ultimately dejected Purley, won that year's World Press Photo award for Photo Sequences. Williamson's incinerated remains would later be cremated with his ashes being sent to an undisclosed area. In the years following the accident, fire-resistant clothing would become mandatory for all trackside marshals so that they would be able to assist in the event of a fire. The next few years also saw a noticeable increase in drivers stopping at accident sites to assist in rescue efforts, notably at the 1976 German Grand Prix.|$|E

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that speech-accompanying gestures influence cognitive processes, {{but it is}} not clear whether the gestural benefit is specific to the gesturing hand. Two experiments tested the ‘(right/left) hand-specificity’ hypothesis for self-oriented functions of gestures: gestures with a particular hand enhance cognitive processes involving the hemisphere contra-lateral to the gesturing hand. Specifically, we tested whether left-hand gestures enhance metaphor explanation, which involves right-hemispheric processing. In Experiment 1, right-handers explained metaphorical phrases (e. g., ‘to spill the beans’, beans represent pieces of information). Participants kept the one hand (right, left) still whilst they were allowed to spontaneously gesture (or not) with their other free hand (left, right). Metaphor explanations were better when participants chose to gesture when their left hand was free than when they did not. An analogous effect of gesturing was not found when their right hand was free. In Experiment 2, different right-handers performed the same metaphor explanation task but, unlike Experiment 1, they were encouraged to gesture with their left hand or right hand or to not gesture at all. Metaphor explanations were better when participants <b>gestured</b> <b>with</b> their left hand than when they did not gesture, but the right hand gesture condition did not significantly differ from the no-gesture condition. Furthermore, we measured participants’ mouth asymmetry during additional verbal tasks to determine individual differences in the degree of right-hemispheric involvement in speech production. The left-over-right-side mouth dominance, indicating stronger right-hemispheric involvement, positively correlated with the left-over-right-hand gestural benefit on metaphor explanation. These converging findings supported the ‘hand-specificity’ hypothesis. Keywords: Metaphor; gesture handedness; brain hemispheric lateralisation; right hemisphere; mouth asymmetry...|$|E
