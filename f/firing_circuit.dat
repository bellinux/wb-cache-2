It took Ashworth and Barnes {{half an hour to}} isolate the failed switch that had caused the malfunction and correct the problem. When the daylight rendezvous point was reached at 09:10, the photo plane failed to appear. [...] The weather planes reported both targets within the required visual attack parameters while Bockscar circled Yakushima waiting for the photo plane because Ashworth did not want to proceed without The Great Artiste and under radio silence it was not certain that it was that aircraft that had rendezvoused with them. Finally the mission proceeded without the photo plane, thirty minutes behind schedule.|$|E
500|$|The Mk 12 Gun Assembly (pictured) was a semi-automatic, power rammed, {{vertical}} sliding-wedge {{breech block}} type gun. Since this gun assembly fired semi-fixed ammunition, (pictured) each round {{was delivered to}} the guns in two pieces. Each gun, in this twin mount, had its own projectile hoist and powder case hoist from the upper handling room. The electric-hydraulic projectile hoist would deliver a projectile next to the projectile man with the nose down and waist high. The electric-hydraulic powder case hoist poked the case through a powder scuttle in the gun room's deck just next to the powder man's feet. [...] At the load command, the powder man would slip a primer protector {{off the end of}} the powder case, extract the case from the scuttle, and lift it into the gun's rammer tray. Meanwhile, the projectile man would pull a projectile out of the hoist, and place it in the rammer tray in front of the powder case. Then, as he turned to get the next projectile out of the hoist, the projectile man would pull down on the rammer lever. This caused the power rammer to ram the projectile and powder case into the chamber. As the powder case cleared the top of the breechblock, the block would rise to seal the chamber. The gun was ready to fire. The case combination primer in the base of the powder case could be fired either electrically or by percussion. Electrical firing was the preferred method because the <b>firing</b> <b>circuit</b> could be energized by firing keys down in the plotting room when firing salvos at surface targets, or up in the director when firing at air targets. Percussion firing could be executed by the Pointer (man controlling elevation) by pushing a foot treadle. When the gun fired, the recoil's rearward motion returned the rammer lever to the up position, and the rammer would drive back {{to the rear of the}} rammer tray. During counter-recoil, the breechblock was automatically lowered and the spent powder case was ejected from the chamber. When the gun returned to battery, a blast of compressed air was sent down the bore to clean it out. The gun was ready to be reloaded.|$|E

All 32 lenses had to detonate within a few millionths of a second of each other, something well beyond {{the state of the art}} of British electronics in 1947. The <b>firing</b> <b>circuits</b> had to be safe, reliable, and durable enough to withstand buffeting in an aircraft. Models were tested in the laboratory in 1950, but the first production versions did not become available until 1951. A problem was then discovered, which was not resolved until 1952. At first it seemed that the fix could not be incorporated in time for Operation Hurricane, the first British nuclear test, which was then only two months away, but in the end a solution was found. Challens flew out to the Montebello Islands for the test with his colleague Eddie Howse, and they were the last ones to touch the bomb, which was installed on board , before it was detonated.|$|R

50|$|Major {{deficiencies}} with Blue Danube {{included the}} use of unreliable lead-acid accumulators to supply power to the <b>firing</b> <b>circuits</b> and radar altimeters.

It was a scientific experiment on a gigantic scale, which needed to be re-engineered to meet service requirements, resulting in Red Beard. A similar account could be written of the first U.S. atomic bomb, Fat Man, which was quickly re-engineered after World War II.|$|R
50|$|The {{launcher}} {{is normally}} {{operated by a}} crew of two, a loader and a gunner. The launcher is loaded by attaching a rocket container {{to the rear of}} the launcher. When the container is attached, the electrical <b>firing</b> <b>circuit</b> is connected. The rocket container is 626 millimetres long and weighs approximately 3.2 kilograms. On the left side of the launcher is the 3× APX M 309 optical sight, which is graduated between 100 and 1,000 metres. The launcher has a shoulder rest and forward pistol grip, both of which may be adjusted to suit the firer. The forward pistol grip contains a mechanical safety switch and the firing mechanism. When the safety is off, pulling the trigger generates a charge which fires the rocket.The watertight rear plug of the rocket container is removed just before firing, which closes the <b>firing</b> <b>circuit</b> and allows the rocket to be fired. The rocket is propelled by a large number of long sticks of tubular propellant that produce a constant pressure while burning, providing constant acceleration. The engine burns out before the rocket leaves the launcher at a velocity of approximately 300 metres per second. As soon as the rocket leaves the launcher, nine fins fold backwards from the rear. These fins provide stability for the rocket while it is in flight. There are two safeties. The first is a bore-riding pin located mid-body of the projectile that blocks the warhead <b>firing</b> <b>circuit.</b> After the projectile leaves the tube, the bore-riding pin falls out releasing the second safety which prevents detonation until the rocket has traveled at least 10 metres from the launcher. The rocket reaches a range of 330 metres in about 1.25 seconds, and 360 metres in 1.36 seconds.|$|E

5000|$|Michael H. Maggelet and James C. Oskins, {{authors of}} [...] "Broken Arrow - The Declassified History of U.S. Nuclear Weapons Accidents", dispute the claim citing a declassified report.

5000|$|The M31 HEAT is a fin-stabilized {{anti-tank}} {{rifle grenade}} {{designed in the}} late 1950s to replace the Belgian ENERGA rifle grenade which {{was adopted by the}} US Army and US Marines as an emergency stop-gap measure during the Korean War. Like the ENERGA, it has a nose-initiated, based-detonated HEAT warhead, but unlike the ENERGA, the mechanical impact fuse system is replaced with a less complex and more reliable piezo-electric fuse system which also allows higher angles of impact, up to 65 degrees. On impact, the nose cover collapses, crushing a crystal-like material, which sends an electric current through a separate wire to the warhead's detonator, located in the base of the warhead. A mechanical safety, comprising a set back system located in the warhead's base, grounds the <b>firing</b> <b>circuit</b> and prevents the accidental explosion of the warhead. On firing, the sudden launch acceleration causes the set-back's three disks to rotate 90 degrees, each in succession to the other, with the rotation of the third disk removing the grounding after approximately 10 meters of flight and completing a <b>firing</b> <b>circuit</b> for the current to flow from the nose to the detonator in the base. Compared to the ENERGA, the M31 is slightly lighter in weight and has a smaller-diameter warhead—i.e. 75mm vs 66mm. Penetration for the M31 is estimated to be 200 mm / 8 inches for steel armor plating [...] and twice that estimate for concrete. The warhead technology developed for the M31 was used for the future M72 LAW antitank rocket.|$|E
