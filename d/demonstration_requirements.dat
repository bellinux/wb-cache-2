40|$|This paper unpacks {{the complex}} {{relations}} between community low carbon transitions, the prosaic state, neoliberal modes of governing, {{and the role}} of numbers therein. It aims to outline {{the ways in which the}} prosaic state can, through everyday tasks, decisions, measurements and <b>demonstration</b> <b>requirements,</b> force a calculative logic onto and into community based movements and groups in ways that can be counterproductive. It centrally argues that the will to quantify, in particular the accompanying <b>demonstration</b> <b>requirements</b> (most often a number), enacts three fundamental shifts in the collective subjectivity integral to community groups and movements. First, the preferred form of knowledge becomes abstract, disembodied and fungible (episteme) over and against relational ways to understand and conceive togetherness (me¯tis), including ecological relationships. Second, the vision of community shifts from a search to belong, an intrinsic end in itself, towards an instrumental means to achieve specific targets. Finally, third, the splitting of means from ends. These can all be traced from the <b>demonstration</b> <b>requirements,</b> and numbers, accompanying neoliberal prosaic state engagement with community groups...|$|E

The best method to obtain emergency power is to augment the basic engine power by increasing the engine's speed and turbine-inlet temperature, combined with water-alcohol injection at the engine inlet. Other methods, including turbine boost power and flywheel energy, offer potential for obtaining emergency power for minimum time durations.

In the second place, a close examination of the relationship between linguistic operations and discourse building activities (for instance with respect to textual analphors) makes it possible to replace this approach in a theoretical viewpoint that neglects neither the linguistic status of speech activities nor their connections with their institutional context.

40|$|Over 20 {{years of}} {{investigation}} by NASA and NOAA scientists and Doppler lidar technologists {{into a global}} wind profiling mission from earth orbit {{have led to the}} current favored concept of an instrument with both coherent- and direct-detection pulsed Doppler lidars (i. e., a hybrid Doppler lidar) and a stepstare beam scanning approach covering several azimuth angles with a fixed nadir angle. The nominal lidar wavelengths are 2 microns for coherent detection, and 0. 355 microns for direct detection. The two agencies have also generated two sets of sophisticated wind measurement requirements for a space mission: science <b>demonstration</b> <b>requirements</b> and operational requirements. The requirements contain the necessary details to permit mission design and optimization by lidar technologists. Simulations have been developed that connect the science requirements to the wind measurement requirements, and that connect the wind measurement requirements to the Doppler lidar parameters.

Far-side inspections of these welds are currently performed on a “best effort ” basis and do not conform to ASME Code Section XI Appendix VIII performance <b>demonstration</b> <b>requirements.</b> For this study, four circumferential welds in 610 mm diameter, 36 mm thick ASTM A- 358, Grade 304 vintage austenitic stainless steel pipe were examined.

A series of saw cuts, electro-discharge machined (EDM) notches, and implanted fatigue cracks were placed into the heat affected zones of the welds. The saw cuts and notches range in depth from 7. 5 % to 28. 4 % through-wall. The implanted cracks ranged in depth from 5 % through wall to 64 % through wall.

The second JTEP demonstration was a battalion-level exercise conducted in December 2003. This demonstration linked the Joint Combat and Tactical Simulation (JCATS), a constructive simulation; the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT), a virtual simulation; the Deployable Force-on-Force Instrumented Range System (DFIRST TM), a live instrumented training system; and observers at the Office of the Adjutant General (OTAG). JCATS and CCTT were located at Camp San Luis Obispo, California; DFIRST was located at Camp Roberts, California; and the OTAG observers were located at Sacramento, California. An early finding {{in the development of}} both JTEP demonstrations was that in order to provide a sufficient level of interoperability for company, battalion, or brigade level exercises, all federates needed to operate on correlated terrain. For the second JTEP <b>demonstration,</b> this <b>requirement</b> proved particularly difficult to satisfy, since the live (DFIRST) entities would be at Camp Roberts, while the best terrain available to the virtual federate (CCTT) was Grafenfels.
