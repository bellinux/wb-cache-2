Such a vehicle, originally codenamed C-Premium in early press reports, was designated CT 200h, CT 300h, or CT 400h in trademark applications filed in June 2009 in the US and in Canada.

Attack should be in {{contention}} for best rock album of 2014." [...] Kevin Hoskins suggests [...] "They do not disappoint... <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> be the best Disciple work to date, and is certainly one of the best albums I have heard all year." [...] Mark Rice forecasts [...] "There is very little to dislike about Attack,... nothing to get upset about." [...] Scott Fryberger contends [...] "Disciple's label tenure may be a little jolted by Attack, but this is still mostly an album for that particular fanbase". John DiBiase foretells [...] "Attack is absolutely refreshing and couldn't have come too soon." ...|$|E

Kelly said, [...] "as long as {{they keep}} Karen [...] the words of wisdom, the kind of sane one, {{the one who is}} trying to make her son {{understand}} what it is that they're really going through at this age, you know, that she keeps it together, then I'm happy because it's nice to be the voice of reason. It's better for me, personally, {{to have that kind of}} role, especially on that kind of show that's geared towards teenagers.

2500|$|Slant Magazine writer Jeremy Winograd called Skeleton Tree [...] "Cave's darkest, most emotionally devastating work to date" [...] {{and said}} that {{although}} it [...] "may not be Cave's most accessible album, owing both to the experimental nature {{of much of the}} music and the fact that its level of emotional rawness makes it a legitimately uncomfortable listen in places, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> be his best"; Wingrod rated the album four-and-a-half-out-of-five stars. Clash gave Skeleton Tree a nine-out-of-ten rating, with reviewer Josh Gray praising Cave and Ellis' songwriting and arrangements and summarising the album as [...] "a stark, beautiful rendering of deep, profound pain." [...] Paula Mejia wrote in Paste that [...] "Skeleton Tree strips down embellishments and brings to the forefront sinister bass lines and a synthesizer that will widen the tear in your heart a little more with every note"; Mejia concluded that [...] "there's something to be said about Skeleton Tree and its starkness, which is as familiar as life and death, an elegy, and a hell of a thing to forget", rating the album nine out of ten. Pitchfork gave the album a nine-out-of-ten rating and selected it as the week's [...] "Best New Music"; [...] "I Need You" [...] was also selected as the week's [...] "Best New Track" [...] and was described as [...] "the stirring core of the Bad Seeds' devastating new album." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{secondary}} education, Dominic {{had to go}} {{to another}} school and it was decided that he would go to the County School at Castelnuovo, three miles (5km) from his home. (Castelnuovo d' Asti, now Castelnuovo John Bosco, was the birthplace of another contemporary of John Bosco, Joseph Cafasso, also a saint. He was four years the senior of John Bosco, and was Bosco's mentor and advisor.) [...] Now ten years old, Dominic walked daily to and from school. In his biography of Dominic Savio, John Bosco records how a local farmer once asked Dominic, on a hot sunny day, if he was not tired from walking, and received the reply: [...] "Nothing seems tiresome or painful when you are working for a master who pays well." [...] Don Bosco also notes that Dominic refused to go swimming with his friends since Dominic considered that in such a situation, it would be [...] "also easy to offend God", he believed that on a previous occasion his friends behaved in, what was to him, a vulgar manner. In his biography Bosco records that Fr. Allora, the head of this school, {{had this to say about}} Dominic: [...] "...Hence <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> be said that he was Savio (wise), not only in name, but in fact, viz., in his studies, in piety, in conversation and his dealing with others, and in all his actions. ..." ...|$|E

50|$|At the time, {{there was}} a great deal of concern over what would happen if the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) or the Florida National Guard were ordered to take custody of Schiavo.

60|$|Now if Jerusalem and {{the temple}} are still called holy, {{even after the}} body and substance, of which they were shadows, were come; then no marvel though some to that day that {{believed}} were entangled therewith, &c.

Upon the whole, after a short consultation, for the creatures came on apace, they resolved to get into a low ground, where they perceived they directed their course, and in which there were a great many trees, and that they would all get up into the trees, and so lie ready to shoot among them as they landed.|$|E

50|$|ODLs are {{different}} from signs, symptoms, and clinical indicators {{in that they are}} defined by the patient, and are not necessarily directly mapped to biomedical models of disease and illness. Examples of ODLs include observations about sleep patterns, exercise behavior and activity trackers, nutritional intake, attitudes and moods, alertness at work or in class, and environmental features such as clutter in the living or working space. Not all patient-generated data constitute ODLs. For example, a patient with diabetes may record their blood glucose levels every day at home, generating data to share with their clinician. That kind of patient-generated data is crucial to inform clinical decision making, but does not constitute ODLs. ODLs are typically defined by patients and their families because they are meaningful to them, and help them self-manage their health and make decisions about <b>it.</b> ODLs <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> complement biomedical indicators and inform medical decision making by providing a more complete and holistic view of the patient as a whole person, provided they are properly integrated in clinical workflows and supported by health information technologies.|$|R
5000|$|The chief prosecutor, Bulot, {{prohibited}} the press from reproducing the interrogatories of Jean Grave and Sébastien Faure, leading Henri Rochefort to write, in L'Intransigeant, that the criminal association concerned not the defendants, but the magistrates and the ministers.

Despite this, the president of the court, Dayras, dismissed all objections from the defense, leading Sébastien Faure to say:"Each time we prove the error of one of your allegations, you declare <b>it</b> unimportant.
