5|$|Harding {{retired in}} 1859 and was succeeded {{by his son}} William White Harding, who had become a partner three years earlier. William Harding changed {{the name of the}} {{newspaper}} to its current name, The Philadelphia Inquirer. Harding, in an attempt to increase circulation, cut the price of the paper, began delivery routes and had newsboys sell papers on the street. In 1859, circulation had been around 7,000; by 1863 it had increased to 70,000. Part of the increase was due to the interest <b>in</b> <b>news</b> during the American Civil War. Twenty-five to thirty thousand copies of The Inquirer were often distributed to Union soldiers during the war and several times the U.S. government asked The Philadelphia Inquirer to issue a special edition specifically for soldiers. The Philadelphia Inquirer supported the Union, but Harding wanted their coverage to remain neutral. Confederate generals often sought copies of the paper, believing that the newspaper's war coverage was accurate.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fifth}} chapter, Stursberg recounts CBC's {{experience}} losing sports licenses. While the CBC had superior market placement (with respect to geographic coverage and experience with amateur sports), {{they lost the}} 2010 and 2012 Olympics to a joint CTV/TSN/Rogers $153 million bid. The Canadian Football League moved its broadcasting rights to TSN with Stursberg citing Commissioner Tom Wright's displeasure with the CBC's poor coverage of CFL games during the CBC 2005 lock-out. The CBC also lost broadcasting rights for The Brier and the Tournament of Hearts to CTV/TSN. Stursberg negotiated for Hockey Night in Canadas NHL rights with Gary Bettman and managed to extend their contract, but at a significantly higher price. The sixth chapter deals with CBC News which, as Stursberg explains, were scheduled to have the local newscasts eliminated. Instead, he initiated style and content reforms, taking effect in October 2009, including {{the creation of an}} internal newswire to provide stories suitable for TV, radio, and web services. He also commissioned an independent study to analyze a perceived anti-conservative bias <b>in</b> <b>news</b> coverage but the study found the coverage to be more conservative friendly than either the Global or CTV coverage. The chapter on Radio noted CBC Radio One's dominance in the Canadian radio market but CBC Radio Two's low ratings. Stursberg advocated for more local radio coverage, especially in the Hamilton area, and facilitated the programming change of CBC Radio Two by inserting more musical variety, specializing in Canadian music.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} fifteen years, language, {{ideology}} {{and power of the}} news articles of two prominent international news websites, namely Aljazeera English (AJE) and CNN has been a controversial topic. The current study explores intertextuality and its function in reproducing the underlying ideology and power relations <b>in</b> the <b>news</b> articles on Palestinian-Israeli conflict <b>in</b> the <b>news</b> Websites of AJE and CNN. The study adopted Fairclough’s (1995) approach to CDA, the Three Dimensional Framework, to examine the use and functions of intertextuality <b>in</b> 6 <b>news</b> articles of AJE and CNN. The study focuses on intertextuality, specifically in the inclusion and exclusion of the “voices” <b>in</b> the <b>news</b> articles through the use of direct and indirect reporting of speech. A Critical Discourse Analysis <b>in</b> the <b>news</b> articles of AJE and CNN reveals how the producers of <b>news</b> articles <b>in</b> the <b>news</b> websites construct and incorporate the various voices for ideological purposes. The study demonstrates that the way writers incorporated the voices <b>in</b> the <b>news</b> articles using the direct and indirect reported speech is found to be loaded with ideological bias. The study reveals that there is a relationship between the way writers report the voices of others <b>in</b> the <b>news</b> articles and the objectives of the writers which clearly show the relationship between language, ideology and power in the new articles of AJE and CNN. The study suggests that the issue of intertextuality <b>in</b> the <b>news</b> articles on to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict published <b>in</b> the international <b>news</b> Websites of AJE and CNN needs to be explored and examined in a broader political context which the news articles are embedded...|$|R
