5|$|In April 1966, Feynman {{delivered}} {{an address}} to the National Science Teachers Association, in which he suggested how students could be made to think like scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to doubt. In the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of intelligent life on planet Earth—creatures such as cats that play and learn <b>from</b> <b>experience.</b> The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another step was needed. Galileo and others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigate ab initio, <b>from</b> <b>experience,</b> what the true situation was—this was science.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{types of}} {{learning}} are possible, respective to each applicable type of learning, only within a limited age range {{known as a}} critical period. Bowlby's concepts included the idea that attachment involved learning <b>from</b> <b>experience</b> during a limited age period, influenced by adult behaviour. He did not apply the imprinting concept in its entirety to human attachment. However, he considered that attachment behaviour was best explained as instinctive, combined with the effect of experience, stressing the readiness the child brings to social interactions. Over time it became apparent there were more differences than similarities between attachment theory and imprinting so the analogy was dropped.|$|E
5|$|In January 1917, {{a second}} mounted division– the Imperial Mounted Division– was formed from the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades and the British 5th and 6th Yeomanry Brigades. A British regular army officer fresh <b>from</b> <b>experience</b> in the Senussi Campaign, Major General Sir H. W. Hodgson, was {{appointed}} to command, with an all-British staff. The deliberate mixing of Australian and Imperial troops was done with Chauvel's approval but was contrary to {{the policy of the}} Australian Government, which soon registered its displeasure, sending Brigadier General Sir Robert Anderson to Cairo to discuss the matter frankly with Chauvel and his superiors. As a result, the Imperial Mounted Division was renamed the Australian Mounted Division.|$|E

25|$|The concept's {{starting}} point is that individuals or organizations seldom learn <b>from</b> <b>experience,</b> unless the experience is assessed and then assigned its own meaning in terms of individual and/or the organization's own goals, aims, ambitions, and expectations. From these processes come insights and added meaning, which is then applied to new circumstances. The end product is better decision-making.|$|E

40|$|Learning <b>from</b> <b>experiences</b> is the {{fundamental}} process of case-based reasoning.

25|$|Karl Shapiro (1913–2000), Randall Jarrell (1914–1965) and James Dickey (1923–1997) all wrote {{poetry that}} sprang <b>from</b> <b>experience</b> of active service. Together with Elizabeth Bishop (1911–1979), Theodor Seuss Geisel ('Dr. Seuss') (1904-1991), Theodore Roethke (1908–1963) and Delmore Schwartz (1913–1966), {{they formed a}} {{generation}} of poets that {{in contrast to the}} preceding generation often wrote in traditional verse forms.|$|E

25|$|A {{submersible}} {{pressure gauge}} {{is used to}} indicate the remaining gas pressure in a diving cylinder. The amount of available gas remaining can be calculated from the pressure and the cylinder internal volume, and {{the time that he}} diver can dive on the available gas depends on the depth and work load, and the fitness of the diver. Breathing rates can vary considerably, and estimates are largely derived <b>from</b> <b>experience.</b> Conservative estimates are generally used for planning purposes.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{criteria}} have obvious psychodynamic implications, such {{as a lack of}} remorse, poor judgment, failure to learn <b>from</b> <b>experience,</b> pathological egocentricity, lack of capacity for love, a general poverty in major affective reactions, and lack of insight into his own condition. Starting in 1972, newer editions of the book reflected a closer alliance with Kernberg's (1984) borderline level of personality organization, specifically defining the structural criteria of the psychopath's identity integration, defensive operations and reality testing.|$|E
25|$|When two solid bodies come in contact, such as A and B in Figure 1, heat {{flows from}} the hotter body to the colder body. <b>From</b> <b>experience,</b> the {{temperature}} profile along the two bodies varies, approximately, {{as shown in the}} figure. A temperature drop is observed at the interface between the two surfaces in contact. This phenomenon {{is said to be a}} result of a thermal contact resistance existing between the contacting surfaces. Thermal contact resistance is defined as the ratio between this temperature drop and the average heat flow across the interface.|$|E

25|$|The {{events in}} a life script are often positive, celebrated, and normative. It {{represents}} and idealized life story.

Individuals should also remember more during their young adulthood because that era is the time of biological maturation, new experiences, adult identity formation, and major events in life scripts.|$|E

25|$|Late in December the destroyers {{sailed to}} Pearl Harbor {{to prepare for}} the next major offensive. John Rodgers {{departed}} Pearl Harbor on 22 January 1944, headed for the Marshall Islands. Profiting <b>from</b> <b>experience</b> gained in previous engagements, the Navy launched a well-coordinated attack on Kwajalein Atoll on 31 January. In addition to providing antiaircraft and antisubmarine protection, John Rodgers supported the landing forces with gunfire which knocked out enemy troop concentrations and pill boxes. After the last resistance disappeared on 7 February, the destroyer patrolled the Marshall Island area until late March.|$|E
