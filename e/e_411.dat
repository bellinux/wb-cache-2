40|$|ABSTRACT An immunocolloidal gold {{electron}} microscopy method is described allowing the ultrastructural localization and quantitation {{of the regulatory}} subunits RI and RII and the catalytic subunit C of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Using a postembedding indirect immunogold labeling procedure that employs specific antisera, the catalytic and regulatory subunits were localized in electron-dense regions of the nucleus and in cytoplasmic areas {{with a minimum of}} nonspecific staining. Antigenic domains were localized in regions of the heterochromatin, nucleolus, interchromatin granules, and in the endoplasmic reticulum of different cell types, such as rat hepatocytes, ovarian granulosa cells, and spermatogonia, as well as cultured H <b>411</b> <b>E</b> hepatoma cells. Morphometric quantitation of the relative staining density of nuclear antigens indicated a marked modulation of the number of subunits per unit area under various physiologic conditions. For instance, following partial hepatectomy in rats, the staining density of the nuclear RI and C subunits was markedly increased 16 h after surgery. Glucagon treatment of rats increased the staining density of only the nuclear catalytic subunit.

40|$|AbstractThe {{activities}} of the sialyltransferase enzymes and the resulting expression of sialoglycoproteins were examined in tumor cells derived from different tissues {{in order to gain}} a greater understanding of the factors controlling the cell glycosylation state. Cell-cell contact, which is dependent on cell confluency state, was shown to influence glycosylation in the neurally-derived mouse neuro- 2 A neuroblastoma and the C 6 glioma cell lines. Both showed a relatively high level of cell sialyltransferase activity under sub-confluent conditions with activity decreasing upon the formation of cell-cell contacts associated with confluency. A parallel decrease in the expression of sialoglycoproteins, as determined by lectin blot analysis, was also observed under these conditions. In contrast, the H <b>411</b> <b>e</b> hepatoma cell line showed an increase in enzyme activity with confluency with the susceptibility of the enzyme in this cell line to glucocorticoid induction only being detected in sub-confluent cell cultures. The number of trypsinisation cycles of the cells was also shown to affect the enzyme activity of the neuro- 2 A and C 6 cells with an increase in enzyme activity coincident with passage number being observed in the neuro- 2 A cells, and a decrease in the C 6 glioma cell line.

Hence, we aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of TTF therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed patients with GBM. Methods. We developed a 3 -health-state Markov model. The perspective was that of the French Health Insurance, and the horizon was lifetime. We calculated the transition probabilities from the survival parameters reported in the EF- 14 trial. The main outcome measure was incremental effectiveness expressed as life-years gained (LYG). Input costs were derived from the literature. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as cost/LYG. We used 1 -way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to evaluate the model uncertainty. Results. In the base-case analysis, adding TTF therapy to standard of care resulted in increases of life expectancy of 4. 08 months (0. 34 LYG) and E 185 476 per patient. The ICER was E 549 909 /LYG.

40|$|The aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AhR) functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor {{that is responsible for}} the activation of several response genes, of which the best characterised is the CYP 1 A 1 gene. The prototype high affinity ligand for the AhR is the environmental pollutant 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). The present study was undertaken in an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of activation of the CYP 1 A 1 gene by several compounds that recently have been reported to be capable of increasing CYP 1 A 1 levels in vivo or in different cellular systems, but are not conventional AhR ligands. The transcriptional activation of the CYP 1 A 1 gene by benzimidazoles like omeprazole (OME), thiabendazole, carbendazim and 2 -mercapto- 5 -metoxy-benzimidazole (MMB), as well as the quinoline compound primaquine (PRQ) was shown to involve the AhR. However, rat, mouse and human hepatoma cell lines responded differently to CYP 1 A 1 induction, suggesting that the determinants for AhR-activation differ between species or cell types. The magnitude and duration of induction was much less pronounced as compared to TCDD, indicating that these compounds are weak activators of the AhR. Both MMB and PRQ were capable of transforming cytosolic AhR to a DNA-binding form, as well as of displacing AhRbound [3 H]TCDD in vitro, indicating that they are low affinity ligands for the Ahr. In contrast, OME was neither capable of transforming AhR to a DNA-bound complex, nor to compete for specific [3 H]TCDD-binding, although the potency of OME and MMB to e. g. cause Gal 4 -AhR activation in rat H <b>411</b> <b>E</b> cells was similar. The involvement of protein kinases in AhR signalling was investigated by using various protein kinase inhibitors. In transfected H <b>411</b> <b>E</b> or HepG 2 cells, inhibition of OME- or TCDDdependent Gal 4 -AhR activation was obtained by using c-src kinase inhibitors as well as by co-transfection of a dominant negative c-src-plasmid, indicating that AhR function is regulated by c-src activity. Three tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein, tyrphostin AG 17 and tyrphostin AG 879, selectively blocked OME- but not TCDD-mediated AhR activation in H <b>411</b> <b>E</b> or HepG 2 cells. These data strongly support the action of a tyrosine kinase dependent pathway in OME-mediated activation of the Ahr, which is different from that of TCDD. When several different residues in the ligand-binding domain of the AhR was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis, a selective and complete loss of Gal 4 -AhR activation by OME, MMB and PRQ, but not by TCDD, was revealed by mutation of Tyr 320 to Phe. Competition of AhR-bound [3 H]TCDD by PRQ was completely abolished in extracts form HEK 293 cells expressing the mutant Gal 4 -Y 32 OF protein, while TCDD-binding was unaffected. These findings indicate that different residues in the ligand-binding pocket of the AhR are important for recognition of low and high affinity ligands, alternatively, phosphorylation of Tyr 320 is critical for activation of the receptor by weak AhR activators, without having a great impact on the activation by high affinity ligands. In summary, two alternative ways of activation of the AhR by novel CYP 1 A 1 inducers have been demonstrated in this study; i) direct low affinity binding and activation of the receptor by MMB and PRQ, and ii) indirect activation of the receptor in a tyrosine kinase dependent pathway by OME, presumably by a ligand-independent mechanism...|$|R

The aim of our study was {{to find out the}} level of serum Vitamin D in chronic periodontitis patients (CHP) with and without type 2 DM. Materials and Methods: This study consists of 141 subjects, including 48 controls. Case groups consisted of 43 chronic periodontitis patients with type 2 DM (CHPDM) and 50 CHP. pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), modified gingival index (MGI), plaque index (PI), and calculus index (CI) were taken. Serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 [OH] D) level in ηg/ml was estimated by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay with Elecsys and cobase e immunoassay analysers(cobase <b>e</b> <b>411).</b> Other laboratory investigations including fasting blood sugar (FBS) and serum calcium were measured in all subjects. Results: The mean serum 25 (OH) D level was 22. 32 ± 5. 76 ηg/ml, 14. 06 ± 4. 57 ηg/ml and 16. 94 ± 5. 58 ηg/ml for control, CHPDM and CHP groups respectively. The difference was statistically significant (P 0. 05). Conclusions: This study observed a low level of serum Vitamin D level in patients with CHP and CHPDM.

Following brain injury, S 100 B is released from damaged astrocytes but also yields repair mechanisms. We measured S 100 B in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum (Cobas <b>e</b> <b>411</b> electrochemiluminescence assay, Roche) longitudinally in a large cohort of patients treated with a ventricular drainage following traumatic brain injury (TBI) or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS software applying the Mann-Whitney rank sum test or chi-test where appropriate. S 100 B in CSF and serum was significantly increased following TBI (n = 71) and SAH (n = 185) {{for at least one}} week following injury. High S 100 B levels in CSF and serum were inconsistent associated with outcome. The passage of S 100 B from CSF to blood (100 ∗ serumS 100 B/CSFS 100 B) was significantly decreased although the albumin quotient suggested an “open ” blood-CSF barrier. Events possibly interfering with the BBB did not affect the S 100 B passage (P =. 591). In conclusion, we could not confirm S 100 B measurements to reliably predict outcome, and a compromised blood-CSF barrier did not affect the passage of S 100 B from CSF to serum. 1...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} sialyltransferase (ST) enzyme activity to be induced in hepatic cells by corticosteroids. In this study, we used the H <b>411</b> <b>e</b> rat hepatoma cell line to further characterise this induction with particular reference to the subsequent changes {{in the pattern of}} sialoglycoprotein (SGP) expression. The induction of total ST activity by dexamethasone was concentration dependent with maximum induction occurring 12 h subsequent to drug addition. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the induction was associated with an increase in the expression of the α 2, 6 (N) ST enzyme with no change in the expression levels of the α 2, 3 (N) enzyme. While the induction resulted in an increase in the reaction velocity (Vmax) of the enzyme for both the sugar donor (CMP-Neu 5 Ac) and the asialofetuin acceptor protein, there was no significant change in the enzyme affinity (Km) for the substrates, suggestive of either an increase in the expression or efficiency of the existing enzyme(s) rather than an induction of novel ST enzymes. Lectin blot analysis of cellular glycoprotein expression demonstrated no change in the expression patterns of either α 2, 3 or α 2, 6 -linked SGP following enzyme induction. These results suggest that the available acceptor sites for the terminal sialic acid group(s) may be fully occupied in the control cells and therefore there are no further sites onto which the sialic acid can be transferred following induction of ST enzyme activity. This {{may be due to the}} high basal enzyme levels in the control cells already exhausting endogenous acceptor sites...|$|R
