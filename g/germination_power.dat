40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to research, the possibility of prediction of germination powers of the seeds for some legume crops, namely green bean (Öz Ayse 16, Dade, Tina and 4 F- 89 Cv.), red podded bean (Gitan and Sirik 97 Cv.), pea (Yaprak and Progres No: 9 Cv.), cowpea (izmir orij. population and karagoz Cv.) and broad bean (Amasya orij. population Cv.) by mathematical models based on temperature. Therefore, a model (D=a-b*T+c*T 2) produced earlier for predicting the time to emergence in relation to temperature for some vegetable crops was utilized. This model changed to (D=a+b*T- c*T 2) for <b>germination</b> <b>power</b> of the legume crops tried. The prediction performance of this model with respect to the data used was highly acceptable. Values of regression coefficients (R 2) varied from 0. 89 to 0. 98 depending on the species. It was found that the new mathematical models obtained after adapting the present data to the above mentioned model could be used safely in predicting <b>germination</b> <b>power</b> for some legume crops. In addition, optimum temperatures (To=b/ 2 *c) for seed <b>germination</b> <b>power</b> were calculated by using the coefficients obtained from the produced regression models...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} seed source (conventional or organic farming) is one {{important}} {{question for the}} variety trials under the conditions of organic farming. Hence, field trials were conducted at two sites in Bavaria in two years (2013 - 2014). Certified organic seed from a Bavarian propagation were compared to conventional seed, offered by breeders for national variety trials. One until two varieties were examined for winter rye and for winter triticale in each year. Organic seed often showed higher crude protein content, conventional seed had mainly higher thousand seed weight and often superior <b>germination</b> <b>power.</b> The grain yield was mostly higher for conventionally produced seeds than for organic seed at one site, whereas seed source showed no differences with one exception at the other site. A high positive correlation was determined for yield and above all <b>germination</b> <b>power</b> for rye. But all in all, data basis is too low for general conclusion.

40|$|Climatic {{changes have}} been {{influencing}} plants since their colonization of land. Plants always {{find a way to}} adapt to these new changes. Also germination of seeds and seedling recruitment have been adapting to climate change. During the last 150 years the current global warming is changing the germinalibity of seeds, the timing of germination, the rate of germination and the seedling recruitment. This bachelor thesis summarizes results of studies on how climate change effects the germination of plants and the seedling recruitment. This work also presents methods used for studying these questions. Studies often focus on germinalibity, the rate of germination and the timing of germination. Some of the species are profiting from these changes and we can observe faster germination and better germinalibity. Reduction of germination occurs in other species and so their fitness is also reduced. The number of studies observing inter-specific variability in germination is greater than studies on intra-specific variability. In my future work I would thus like to focus on the effect of climate change on intra-specific variability in <b>germination.</b> <b>Powered</b> by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R

40|$|Switchgrass is a {{perennial}} C 4 plant with great {{potential as a}} bioenergy source and, thus, a high demand for establishment from seed. This research investigated the effects of ultrasound treatment on germination and seedling growth in switchgrass. Using an orthogonal matrix design, conditions for the ultrasound pretreatment in switchgrass seed, including sonication time (factor A), sonication temperature (factor B) and ultrasound output power (factor C), were optimized for germinating and stimulating seedling growth (indicated as plumular and radicular lengths) through modeling analysis. The results indicate that sonication temperature (B) was the most effective factor for <b>germination,</b> whereas output <b>power</b> (C) had the largest effect on seedling growth when ultrasound treatment was used. Combined with the analyses of range, variance and models, the final optimal ultrasonic treatment conditions were sonication for 22. 5 min at 39. 7 °C and at an output power of 348 W, which provided the greatest germination percentage and best seedling growth. For this study, the orthogonal matrix design was an efficient method for optimizing the conditions of ultrasound seed treatment on switchgrass. The electrical conductivity of seed leachates in three experimental groups (control, soaked in water only, and ultrasound treatment) was determined to investigate the effects of ultrasound on seeds and eliminate the effect {{of water in the}} ultrasound treatments. The results showed that the electrical conductivity of seed leachates during either ultrasound treatment or water bath treatment was significantly higher than that of the control, and that the ultrasound treatment had positive effects on switchgrass seeds...|$|R
40|$|Although {{radio-frequency}} (RF) {{methods have}} been used for decades in many heating and drying processes, there is still a need for more engineering design data related to the design of the applicators and the performance of these systems before costly prototypes are built. Energy, temperature, and the effect produced by the high frequency field parameters on biological materials need to be examined with regard to their effects on the resulting processing requirements. Wheat-seed infection by a fungus such as Fusarium graminearum can considerably lower the seed germination {{and the quality of the}} harvest. A study was thus conducted to determine the combined effect of different levels of RF power, temperature, and moisture content on the quality of seed-grade wheat and fungus inactivation. Similar treatment combinations were studied with seed-grade soybean in view on improving <b>germination.</b> With higher <b>power,</b> higher temperature (90 °C) and higher moisture content (14 %), the fungus mortality significantly increased, with a fungal vigour of less than 0. 1, and the germination quality of the seeds decreased to a germination vigour below 0. 3. For soybean seeds, only treatments of low RF intensity (60 °C) were successful in improving germination vigour especially at lowest moisture content typically found in stored seeds. RF treated wheat was studied to identify the relationship between heating conditions and grain quality categorized in terms of kernel viability and structural damage. The potential of an RF thermal treatment to improve and extend the storability of vacuum packaged carrot sticks was investigated. The results have shown that it is possible to treat carrot sticks to 60 °C in less than 2 min to reduce the initial microbial load. The RF-treatments maintained colour, the vacuum of the packages, and the excellent taste of the carrot sticks. RF heating was studied for the pasteurization of prepared samples of ham. The ham samples were brought to internal temperatures of 75 and 85 °C, by RF heating with a 10 min residence time. The study indicates that radio-frequency heating can improve the storability of re-packed hams by reducing the bacterial load, reducing moisture loss during storage and maintaining an overall greater product quality.

30|$|In {{order to}} solve the {{problems}} related to deforestation and meet the ever increasing demands of the growing population, which will require sustainable use of forest products on sustainable manner, conserving and wise utilization of the remaining forests and supporting it with additional tree planting are crucial. However, several factors are known to have effects on the production of quality seedlings with required numbers. These factors include the availability of essential nutrients, proper soil mixture, sowing depth, viability of seeds, sowing date, and timing and frequency of watering. These determine the <b>germination</b> <b>power</b> of the seeds, the number of seedlings to be emerged, and their quality. Several studies have been carried out on the impacts of these factors and how they are affecting the raising of a required number of seedlings of required quality. For example, sowing depth can influence germination rate and amount and, thus, final number of seedlings in the seed beds (Duryea and Landis 1984). The nature of the seed itself is a key element in plant production and can influence the success and failures of both natural and artificial regeneration (Bichi 2012).|$|E

40|$|Unlike {{chemical}} treatment an efficacy of microorganism-based products depends on many factors {{under field conditions}} in tests following EPPO guidelines. In this study following factors appeared as dominant: the way of disease transfer in a seed, varietal sensitivity to the disease, temperature and humidity. Antagonistic microorganisms Bacillus subtilis, Trichoderma harzianum and Pythium oligandrum showed significant activity especially against the disease transfered {{on the surface of}} wheat seed (Tilletia caries), differentiated efficacy and connections with trial conditions were determined. Required registration level of efficacy does 99, 5 % and was allways reached by reference products (tebuconazol, fludioxonil). Taking no account of above-mentioned factors in average more than sixty per cent efficacy in czech origin products Ibefungin and Polyversum and nearly fourty per cent efficacy in Supresivit against T. caries was achieved (with artificial inoculation 2 g spores of T. caries per 1 kg wheat seed). B. subtilis formulated as the product Ibefungin (1, 0. 109 spores per 1 ml, rate 3 ml per 1 kg of seed) showed statistically significant potential against T. caries on winter wheat (up to hundred per cent efficacy), in soil temperatures exceeding 10 oC at the beginning of emergence. Mean efficacy of 65 % was negatively influenced by very dry weather in 1991. On winter rye in lower level of infection and higher soil temperature during the emergence statistically significant tendency to weak efficacy against Fusarium nivale was found out. The influence of pH within 6, 3 - 7, 3 as limit factor was not determined in these trials, in accordance with presumptions. P. oligandrum formulated as the product Polyversum (1, 0. 105 - 7 oospores per 1 g, at least 50 % <b>germination</b> <b>power,</b> rate 3 g per 1 kg of seed), showed statistically significant potential against T. caries on winter wheat (efficacy 53 - 79 %), even in soil temperatures below 10 oC in the emergence. The lowest level of efficacy on the most susceptible variety (Zdar) was achieved. On winter rye in one of four trials and without any obvious connection with trial conditions statistically significant tendency to weak efficacy against Fusarium nivale was found out. The influence of pH within 5, 7 - 7, 4 as limit factor was not determined in these trials, in accordance with presumptions. T. harzianum, formulated as the product Supresivit (1, 4. 1010 conidia per 1 g, at least 70 % <b>germination</b> <b>power,</b> rate 2 g per 1 kg of seed), showed also statistically significant potential against T. caries on winter wheat (efficacy 20 - 54 %), even in soil temperatures below 10 oC during the emergence. The lowest level of efficacy on the most susceptible variety (Zdar) was achieved. The product was not tested on winter rye, because of supposed higher temperature requirements. The influence of pH within 5, 7 - 7, 4 as limit factor was not determined in these trials despite expectations either in neutral soils or in alkalic ones. Above-mentioned results implicate several aspects: Firstly, the efficacy of antagonistic microorganisms can not compete with chemical active ingredients. Secondly, in alternative agriculture the application of some above-mentioned products could make a sense, especially if referred-to conditions would be taken into consideration. Thirdly, the potential can be developed: i) by the choice or modifications of more efficient and even more condition-resistant strains, ii) by the isolation and contingent synthesis of ingredients which take part in the mode of microorganism action, iii) by the combination of microorganisms and other active ingredientsAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|E
40|$|Vicia hirsuta (L.) Gray S. F. (tiny vetch) is {{a common}} and {{persistent}} segetal weed. Tiny vetch seeds and pods reach different stages of maturity during the crop harvest season.

The objective {{of this study was to}} describe selected aspects of tiny vetch seed ecology: to determine the rate of individual reproduction of vetch plants growing in winter and spring grain crops and to evaluate the germination of seeds at different stages of maturity, subject to storage conditions. The seeds and pods of V. hirsuta were sorted according to their development stages at harvest and divided into two groups. The first group was stored under laboratory conditions for two months. In the autumn of the same year, the seeds were subjected to germination tests. The remaining seeds were stored in a storeroom, and were planted in soil in the spring. The germination rate was evaluated after 8 months of storage. Potential productivity (developed pods and flowers, fruit buds) was higher in plants fruiting in winter wheat than in spring barley. Vetch plants produced around 17 - 26 % more pods (including cracked, mature, greenish-brown and green pods) and around 25 % less buds in winter wheat than in spring barley. Immature seeds were characterized by the highest germination capacity. Following storage under laboratory conditions and stratification in soil, mature seeds germinated at a rate of several percent. After storage in a storeroom, seeds at all three development stages broke dormancy at a rate of 72 - 75 %.

40|$|Weeds just {{will not}} {{lie down and}} take 'No!' for an answer. After the umpteenth round of weeding, they shoot up again, ruining harvests and elbowing out crops altogether. If we {{understood}} better why weeds appear and re-appear we could work on better control measures instead of simply trying to eradicate them. If we don t want them, {{we need to be}} ahead of them. Despite their pretty-pretty, esoteric names such as the devil s horse whip or prickly pigweed, weeds generally wreak more havoc than their fellow pests of insects, bacteria and viruses. They cause phenomenal losses in agriculture, especially in tropical areas where one-quarter of a crop s harvest is lost to weeds. Fighting them also accounts for huge amounts of time and energy. Weeding by hand or hoe {{is one of the most}} time-consuming tasks in agriculture, and a task performed mostly by women and children. But when exactly is a weed a weed? A couple of maize stalks in a field of tomatoes can be considered weeds but real weeds are plants that grow in places where they are really unwanted, either because they compete with crops for nutrients, water and sunlight, or because they are poisonous. Most farmers therefore make a distinction between useful and harmful weeds. The 'useful weeds' it takes some time to get that over your tongue, maybe - are the ones that are used for medicines, as fodder for animals and herbs in cooking. Or they may be the plants that keep vermin out of crops, fix nitrogen in the soil or provide protection against erosion. As long as they do not compete too much with the actual crops, they are left to grow for the purpose they serve. Alongside this approach is that of 'relaxed weeding' which means pulling out those weeds that are harmful, toxic and really have no purpose nor any use, not even as compost or fuel. In smallholder farms, weeds are regarded in a different way to on large commercial farms or plantations where any plant other than the cash crop is called a weed, whether useful or not. Weeds make haste About 8, 000 plants worldwide are currently considered as real weeds and out of these, a small elite of 250 are considered as the world s major noxious, or harmful, weeds. Now you won t find them all together in your field. Obviously not. After all, one weed may be harmful or hostile to another. And, as any other plant, they all have their preferences for temperature, soils, fertility and humidity. Small wonder that weeds occur between and around crops with similar preferences. Weeds have things in common too. One classical farmer s saying explains how to tell weeds from vegetables: If you see anything growing, pull it out. If it starts to grow again, it was a weed. One trait of weeds is that they grow and propagate fast. Sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste, as Shakespeare once wrote. Annual weeds produce large amounts of seeds which often retain their <b>germination</b> <b>power</b> for years and years. For example, Amaranthus spp produces up to 235, 000 seeds per plant cycle, and is regarded as a pesky weed by many farmers, whereas it has also been a staple food for more than 4, 000 years in central America. Perennial weeds propagate vegetatively through rootstocks, tubers, rhizomes (stems) or through running across the soil surface. Another thing weeds have in common is their reason to exist and why they shoot up so fast and in such large numbers on barren land. When we clear native vegetation, plough the soil and establish annual or perennial crops, we are in fact defying the ecological succession of the course of nature. We are thus holding back the process of natural plant succession, which really aims at changing the environment back into its previous state as a forest. Weeds are pioneer crops and thrive on soils with low fertility and low plant diversity. In that respect weeds are also telling us that things are none too bright in the soil. For shifting cultivators, for instance, the start of excessive weed growth has always been the signal to pack up and move on. A bit of everything For decades, it was believed that modern agriculture would achieve production increases mainly through a combination of mechanisation, mono-cropping, improved varieties, applying agro-chemicals and, indeed, fighting weeds at all cost. Applying herbicides to a weed was seen as much easier and cheaper than using labour to remove it either manually or mechanically. As time passed, however, herbicide resistance grew, as did general awareness about the environmental and health aspects of agro-chemicals. All the while, the weeds were literally gaining ground. Each year, as more and more herbicides were applied, so too did the crop losses caused by weeds. Basically, weed management revolves around five sets of measures. Using chemicals is one. Herbicides have the major disadvantage of being costly and sometimes dangerous, as well as their other constraints. Applying fertilisers is another - also costly chemical way of managing weeds, by increasing soil fertility. Biological measures present a second way of managing weeds. Applying intercropping or mulching, agroforestry or growing cover crops are examples of these (see boxes). A third way is through the genetic alteration of crops, using conventional breeding techniques or genetic engineering, to increase the crop s resistance or tolerance to weeds. The commonest way to get rid of weeds is through tillage and weeding. Other cultural techniques, such as burning vegetation and ploughing the soil can be counter-productive since they create an ideal environment or, to call a spade a spade, an ecological desert - for weeds to pop up and start their first phase of succession. And the fifth way? Well, as with many things in life, a combination of approaches can often yield the best result. If a good farmland is the reflection of a healthy natural ecosystem, where soil fertility is kept up in order and plant diversity mimics nature, then there is no need for noxious weeds to emerge in such large numbers. Where there s a will, there s a way. Where there s a will, there s no weed. [caption to illustration] The picture of proverbs. Many hands make light work, but prevention is better than cure.
