50|$|The {{first known}} {{electronic}} Nertz game was Nertz! The Card Game by John Ronnander and Majicsoft for the Atari ST system {{and was released}} for purchase in 1995. It was capable linking nine Atari systems for a large human multiplayer experience and also had an option in which two players could play on a single system. Since then many others have produced electronic Nertz-style games {{in an attempt to}} bring the Nertz experience to consoles, PCs, and mobile apps. The first Nertz game offered to PC's was eNerts released in 2000 by John Drake. One could purchase and download this game for the Windows OS from the eNerts website. eNerts offered users matches against AI opponents with adjustable difficulty settings. In 2007 Solitaire Showdown was added to the list of free games available to play on Windows Live Messenger (then MSN Messenger). To play this game one would challenge a friend from their messenger friend list to a heads-up match. In 2008, Games.com (or AOL Games) added a free online Nertz game called Solitaire Race to their list of games. In this game one could play up to four human or computer opponents. In the same year, two other Nertz PC games, available as software, were released which were Nertz Solitaire and Nerts <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Card</b> Game. Nertz Solitaire was a game based on the NERTZ LLC decks using squirrel characters as opponents. This PC game only offered AI opponents and was available for download and purchase online only. Nerts <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Card</b> Game was also available for download and purchase online only but this game offered both human and AI opponent capabilities. This game was developed by John Ronnander, the same person who released the first electronic Nertz game in 1995.|$|E

40|$|Abstract â€“ ElectricitÃ© de France (EDF) {{is funding}} a 3 -year PhD work on {{acoustic}} scintillation flow metering, {{in association with}} Hydro-QuÃ©bec and ASL AQFlow. The PhD project aims at improving the discharge estimation when hydraulic conditions are not ideal for acoustic scintillation measurements, {{as well as providing}} {{a better understanding of the}} effects of sources of interference which can be encountered during the measurement process and can cause inaccuracies in the velocity estimation. In order to achieve these objectives, a fast and portable data acquisition system was set up, which relies on <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> acquisition <b>cards.</b> Each four channel acquisition card can be connected in parallel with up to three others, thus forming a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> multi channel data acquisition (DAQ) system.

As the ASFM replaced the existing trash rack elements, special equipment was designed and built to create turbulence in the flow necessary for the acoustic scintillation to operate. HPP performance tests by Hydro Quebec were duplicated with the EDF measurement system which recorded the acoustic scintillation raw signals. Using the resources available at the time, the acquired time series have a lower resolution than those provided by the Acoustic Scintillation Flow Meter (ASFM).

40|$|Abstract: Acoustic Emission (AE) is a {{sensitive}} technique {{which can be}} used to characterise damage in high strength composite plate. This paper describes an extension to an earlier piece of research work carried out by the ERC which resulted in the successful development of a novel source location methodology for the said material. The previous work concentrated on the source location in plate-like composite structures using acoustic emission. The work presented in this paper focuses on establishing the correlation between the different damage types suffered in the material namely de-lamination, matrix cracking, fibre rupture and stringer to skin debonding with key signal features of the AE activities. Controlled bending tests were initially carried out on laterally grooved slender composite specimens to progressively propagate damage in the weakened region of these specimens. The composite laminate plate itself is made from 16 plies of carbon fibre twill weaved in an epoxy matrix with bidirectional fibre alignments in the 0 Â° and 90 Â° directions with 60 / 40 fibre-matrix volume composition. These prepared samples were fully instrumented with broad band (100 kHz to 1 MHz) Physical Acoustic AE sensors linked to the necessary signal conditioning hardware.

40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical And Electronic Engineering) A brief {{introduction}} to laser Doppler anemometry is given. Signal processing techniques for LOA are discussed with specific {{reference to the}} salient {{advantages and disadvantages of}} each. The abovementioned discussion motivates the use of adaptive filters as parametric spectral estimators for frequency ext~action from Doppler signals. Two adaptive algorithms ie. 'the least mean sqaures' (LMS) and the 'recursive least sqaures' (RLS), are discussed. Results of a real-time application of the LMS algorithm, as implemented on the TMS 320 - 10, as well as the results from a full study of the Kalman algorithm are shown and discussed. The implementation of a digital signal processor to make the application of parametric spectral estimation to LOA viable is discussed under the following headings: analogue module; mathematical processor; communications module; storage an~ display unit. The system is based qn a eight bit converter with conversion rates ranging from the lower audio range to 20 MHz. It has a versatile trigger system to facilitate easy capture of Doppler data.

Ultraviolet single photon {{can be obtained}} by ultraviolet lighr emitted by a mercury lamp and is attenuated by filters.

The temperature characteristics of quality factor of silicon micro gyroscope are also presented. The theoretical analysis suggests that the air damping is the key factor determining the quality factor of silicon micro gyroscope and the quality factor determined by the air damping is in inverse proportion to the square root of temperature. According to the theory, the reciprocal of the quality factor of gyroscope can be approximately expressed as a linear equation with respect to temperature over a temperature range from 238 K to 328 K. Using the <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> data acquisition <b>card</b> to sample the decayed drive amplitude signal of gyroscope, the quality factor of gyroscope can be calculated from those sample data.
