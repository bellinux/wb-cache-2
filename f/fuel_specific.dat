40|$|Copyright © 2005 SAE International Simultaneous {{reduction}} of nitric oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions {{is possible in}} a diesel engine by employing a Partially Premixed Compression Ignition (PPCI) strategy. PPCI combustion is attainable with advanced injection timings and heavy exhaust gas recirculation rates. However, over-advanced injection timing can result in the fuel spray missing the combustion bowl, thus dramatically elevating PM emissions. The present study investigates whether the use of narrow spray cone angle injector nozzles can extend the limits of early injection timings, allowing for PPCI combustion realization. It is shown that a low flow rate, 60 -degree spray cone angle injector nozzle, along with optimized EGR rate and split injection strategy, can reduce engine-out NOx by 82 % and PM by 39 %, {{at the expense of}} a modest increase (4. 5 %) in fuel consumption. This PPCI strategy has the potential for meeting upcoming stringent <b>fuel</b> <b>specific</b> NOx emission levels of less than 1 g/kg-fuel and <b>fuel</b> <b>specific</b> PM levels less than 0. 25 g/kg-fuel...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: California and Federal {{emissions}} {{regulations for}} 2007 and newer heavy-duty diesel engines require {{an order of}} magnitude reduction in particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen spurring the introduction of new aftertreatment systems. Since 2008, four emission measurement campaigns have been conducted at a Port of Los Angeles location and an inland weigh station in the South Coast Air Basin of California. <b>Fuel</b> <b>specific</b> oxides of nitrogen emissions at the Port have decreased 12 % since 2010 while infrared opacity (a measure of particulate matter) remained low, showing no diesel particulate filter deterioration. The weigh station truck’s <b>fuel</b> <b>specific</b> oxides of nitrogen emission reductions since 2010 (18. 5 %) almost double the previous three year’s reductions and are the result of new trucks using selective catalytic reduction systems. Trucks at the weigh station equipped with these systems have a skewed oxides of nitrogen emissions distribution (half of the emissions were from 6 % of the measurements) and had significantly lower emissions than similarly equipped Port trucks. Infrared thermographs of truck exhaust pipes revealed that the mean temperature observed at the weigh station (225 ± 4. 5 °C) was 70 °C higher than for Port trucks, suggesting that the catalytic aftertreatment systems on trucks at our Port site were often below minimum operating temperatures...|$|E

40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} {{model for}} fuel mixing and conversion in a bubbling fluidized bed has been developed. The model includes fuel particle size development and calculates the concentration profile for char, volatiles, moisture and ash {{as well as}} the fuel particle size distribution. Three different kinds of units have been modelled: gasification, combustion and chemical-looping combustion. Two types of fuels, wood and coal, have been used. Based on the results from the model, the addition of a fragmentation sub-model is very important to fully characterize the char composition in the outlet and the inclusion of particle size classes and particle size development has a large effect on the result. The model presents convergence problems for certain combinations of inputs, such as combustion of fragmenting wood. The model results are sensitive to the value of many inputs such as <b>fuel</b> <b>specific</b> parameters regarding fragmentation and reaction kinetics. Because of these inputs, the use of the model for non-characterized fuels can only be of more qualitative than quantitative use...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{amount of}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{emissions}} produced by cars is a linear (albeit <b>fuel</b> <b>specific)</b> function {{of the amount of}} fuel consumed. Because CO 2 emissions generate social costs, through their effect on climate change, which escape the price mechanism, a tax on CO 2 is indicated. An ideal tax would alter the consumer prices so that they match the marginal social costs. This setting thus calls for a specific tax on fuel equal to the value of externality resulting from the combustion of a unit of fuel. Since such tax scheme is readily available, we study to what extent the existing CO 2 tax policies make use of it. We find that they do only to a limited extent. Thus our policy prescription is to drop existing CO 2 taxes and use the existing fuel taxes to adjust fuel prices so that they match the marginal social costs related to burning of fuel...|$|E

The capture factors are applied to the original CO 2 emissions scenarios at a highly disaggregated level. The results are summed up and presented. The results indicate that {{it might be possible to}} capture and store a significant quantity of energy related CO 2, especially in the second quarter of this century. Yet the amounts of CO 2 still being emitted remain considerable, suggesting that other technologies will also be needed if the threat of climate change requires large reductions of CO 2 emissions over the next few decades...|$|E

On-road particulate matter emissions ranged between 104 to 106 particles/cm 3 with the majority of the particles by number being less than 50 nm in diameter. High-speed traffic produced high nanoparticle number concentrations and diesel traffic further increased number concentrations. At high vehicular speeds, particulate matter emissions increase because of higher engine load and fuel consumption. Measurements made at speeds less than 20 mph showed lower number but higher volume concentrations and larger particles. Measurements made 10 - 30 m from the highway in residential areas approached on-road concentrations with similar size distributions and high concentrations of nanoparticles. Lower concentrations and larger particles were observed in residential areas 500 to 700 m from the highway. <b>Fuel</b> <b>specific</b> and particle/mi emission rates were estimated from data collected on two different days.
