5|$|Among the Ainu, the otter {{is portrayed}} as an {{occasional}} messenger between humans and the creator. The sea otter is a recurring figure in Ainu folklore. A major Ainu epic, the Kutune Shirka, tells the tale of wars and struggles over a golden sea otter. Versions of a widespread Aleut legend tell of lovers or despairing women who plunge into the sea and become otters. These links {{have been associated with}} the many human-like behavioral features of the sea otter, including apparent playfulness, strong mother-pup bonds and tool use, yielding to ready anthropomorphism. The beginning of commercial exploitation had a great impact on the human, as well as animal, populations the Ainu and Aleuts have been displaced or their numbers are dwindling, while the coastal tribes of North America, where the otter <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> case greatly depleted, no longer rely as intimately on sea mammals for survival.|$|E
5|$|Four {{anatomic}} features must {{be present}} for orotracheal intubation to be straightforward: adequate mouth opening (full {{range of motion}} of the temporomandibular joint), sufficient pharyngeal space (determined by examining {{the back of the}} mouth), sufficient submandibular space (distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin, the space into which the tongue must be displaced in order for the larygoscopist to view the glottis), and adequate extension of the cervical spine at the atlanto-occipital joint. If any of these variables <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> way compromised, intubation should be expected to be difficult.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{reject the}} idea that Hamlet <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> way connected with Shakespeare's only son, Hamnet Shakespeare, who died in 1596 at age eleven. Conventional wisdom holds that Hamlet is too obviously connected to legend, and the name Hamnet was quite popular at the time. However, Stephen Greenblatt {{has argued that the}} coincidence of the names and Shakespeare's grief for the loss of his son may {{lie at the heart of}} the tragedy. He notes that the name of Hamnet Sadler, the Stratford neighbour after whom Hamnet was named, was often written as Hamlet Sadler and that, in the loose orthography of the time, the names were virtually interchangeable.|$|E

5|$|Tatum is paroled and {{the media}} begins hyping the fight. Marge makes Moe promise her that the moment Homer <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> danger, he will throw in the towel. The fight starts and {{it is obvious that}} Homer cannot {{withstand}} Tatum's barrage and is in danger of being knocked out. Homer decides to fight back, but misses completely. As Tatum readies himself to deliver the final blow, Moe flies in using the Fan Man's paramotor and carries Homer away. Outside the arena, Marge thanks Moe for saving Homer and Tatum shows respect for the love Moe showed for Homer. Sweet declares that Moe will always be a loser, but still gives him a check for $100,000. Moe starts up the paramotor and flies off into the night.|$|E

25|$|The DVB-T {{standard}} {{is not used}} for terrestrial digital television in North America. Instead, the ATSC standard calls for 8VSB modulation, which has similar characteristics to the vestigial sideband modulation used for analog television. This provides considerably more immunity to interference, but is not immune— as DVB-T is— to multipath distortion and also does not provide for single-frequency network operation (which <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> case not relevant in the United States).|$|E

25|$|Many letters have shapes {{also found}} in the {{historical}} runic alphabets, but their sound values are only similar in a few of the vowels. Rather, the system of assignment of sound values is much more systematic in the Cirth than in the historical runes (e.g., voiced variants of a voiceless sound are expressed by an additional stroke). A similar system has been proposed for a few historical runes but <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> case much more obscure.|$|E
25|$|However, while {{clinical}} hyperthyroidism {{is associated}} with frank neuropsychological and affective alterations, the occurrence of these alterations and their treatment in mild and subclinical hyperthyroidism remains a controversial issue. Regardless of the inconsistent findings, a 2007 study by Andersen et al. states that the distinction between subclinical and overt thyroid disease <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> case somewhat arbitrary. Subclinical hyperthyroidism {{has been reported in}} 63% of euthyroid Graves' disease., but only in 4% of cases where Graves' disease was in remission.|$|E
25|$|One has {{to notice}} that nearby the {{necropolis}} a rectangular structure has been erected but this building is in concrete and clearly referable to the Roman age, even if it cannot be completely ruled out– {{due to the lack}} of excavations– that underneath the Roman building there was a nuragic megaron temple.

25|$|As is {{the case}} for Quebec's other {{national}} parks (with the exception of Pingualuit and Kuururjuaq national parks, which are administered by Nunavik parks), the Mont-Saint-Bruno national park has been administered by the Société des établissements de plein air du Québec (SÉPAQ) since 1999. The SÉPAQ oversees the provision of activities and services as well as park protection and promotion. The exploitation of natural resources for forestry, mining or energy production is forbidden, as it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> other of Quebec's parks, and so are hunting, trapping and poaching. The passage of gas or oil pipelines is also forbidden in all parks except for existing installations.|$|E
25|$|In a 1926 excavation, Sune Lindqvist {{found at}} least three levels of {{previous}} occupation under and immediately {{to the north of}} the church at Gamla Uppsala. In the layer immediately underlying the church, dated to approximately 900 C.E., he found post-holes that he interpreted as the remains of the great hof described by Adam of Bremen. He interpreted them as two concentric rectangles, the remains of an almost square building with a high roof. However, as Olsen demonstrated, the remains are too sparse to support this interpretation, which <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> case based on Carl Schuchhardt's reconstruction of the Wendish temple at Arkona, a later and non-Germanic site. Moreover, Schuchhardt's excavation was rushed and his own data do not certainly support the square plan that he later claimed to have found at two other Baltic sites.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{concentrations}} of non-opiate substances relative to the diamorphine content of the drug, abuse and overdose of cheese are more dangerous than pure-form opiate overdoses. Emergency personnel must address the overdose effects of each component of the drug, since the contents and concentrations of each component vary widely among batches they must wait for either {{the completion of the}} toxicology report to begin treatment or wait for the effects of each drugs overdose to manifest. The acetaminophen content of the drug induces severe, irreversible damage to the liver when taken in high doses for long periods of time. Very high doses of acetaminophen are capable of producing acute liver failure and death within hours, patients who survive this acute phase of the toxicity generally require dialysis and eventually a liver transplant. Due to the many methods of preparation a user can not know how much acetaminophen <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> given batch and therefore can not reliably determine a safe dose. A dose of the last batch which produced no toxic effects may produce lethal effects in the next batch.|$|E
500|$|Solar {{electricity}} is inherently variable and predictable by time of day, location, and seasons. In addition solar is intermittent due to day/night cycles and unpredictable weather. How {{much of a}} special challenge solar power <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> given electric utility varies significantly. In a summer peak utility, solar is well matched to daytime cooling demands. [...] In winter peak utilities, solar displaces other forms of generation, reducing their capacity factors.|$|E

It <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> case clear that Etruscan temples could take a number of forms, and also varied over the 400-year period during which they were being made. Nonetheless Vitruvius remains the inevitable starting point for a description, and a contrast of Etruscan temples with their Greek and Roman equivalents. [...] There are also a few model temples in pottery, and depictions on tombs or vases. [...] Remains of the architectural terracotta elements sometimes survive in considerable quantities, and museums, mostly in Italy, have good collections of attractively shaped and painted antefixes in particular.|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} that the marriage with Elisiv had been agreed to already during Harald's first time in Rus', or that they at least had been acquainted. During his service in the Byzantine Empire, Harald composed a love poem which included the verse [...] "Yet the goddess in Russia/ will not accept my gold rings" [...] (whom Snorri Sturluson identifies with Elisiv), although Morkinskinna claims that Harald had to remind Yaroslav of the promised marriage when he returned to Kiev. According to the same source, Harald had spoken with Yaroslav during his first time in Rus', requesting to marry Elisiv, only to be rejected because he was not yet wealthy enough. It <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> case significant that Harald was allowed to marry the daughter of Yaroslav, since his other children were married to figures such as Henry I of France, Andrew I of Hungary and the daughter of Constantine IX.|$|E
500|$|The obverse of {{the coin}} {{features}} William Bradford. He wears a hat and carries a Bible under his arm. Bradford, noted for piety, {{is intended to be}} seen in a moment of meditation. Dallin's plaster models had the words [...] "HOLY BIBLE" [...] on the volume; these, together with Dallin's initials [...] "CED", were removed. Instead, the initial D was placed under Bradford's elbow, likely impressed upon the hub as an afterthought by a punch normally used to create the mint mark D for the Denver Mint. Numismatists Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen deemed Bradford's broad collar near enough to Puritan wear of the day to pass, though they questioned the authenticity of the ruffled cravat. Bradford's portrait <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> case an invention; no genuine likeness of him is known.
