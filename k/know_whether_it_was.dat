500|$|Graham Cluley, a {{technology}} consultant from Sophos, said, [...] "We {{have no way}} of knowing if it was written by the FBI, and even if we did, we wouldn’t <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> being used by the FBI or if it had been commandeered by a third party". Another reaction came from Marc Maiffret, chief technical officer and cofounder of eEye Digital Security, [...] "Our customers are paying us for a service, to protect them from all forms of malicious code. It is not up to us to do law enforcement's job for them so we do not, and will not, make any exceptions for law enforcement malware or other tools." ...|$|E
500|$|Congress had {{appointed}} General Lee {{to command}} the Continental Army troops in the southern colonies, and his movements by land shadowed those of Clinton's fleet as it sailed south. Lee wrote from Wilmington on June 1 that the fleet had sailed, but {{that he did not}} <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> sailing for Virginia or South Carolina. He headed for Charleston, saying [...] " [...] confess I know not whether I shall go to or from the enemy." [...] He arrived in Charleston shortly after the fleet anchored outside the harbor, and took command of the city's defenses. He immediately ran into a problem: the South Carolina troops (militia or the colonial regiments) were not on the Continental line, and thus not formally under his authority. Some South Carolina troops resisted his instructions, and Rutledge had to intervene by proclaiming Lee in command of all South Carolina forces.|$|E
2500|$|The {{frequencies}} {{at which}} a drumhead can vibrate depends on its shape. [...] The Helmholtz equation calculates the frequencies if the shape is known. [...] These frequencies are the eigenvalues of the Laplacian in the space. [...] A central {{question is whether the}} shape can be predicted if the frequencies are known. [...] No other shape than a square vibrates at the same frequencies as a square. [...] Kac did not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible for two different shapes to yield the same set of frequencies.|$|E

2500|$|We {{took the}} prisoners {{to the high}} hills above Evin. They were blind-folded and their hands were tied. We got them off the minibus and had them sit on the ground. Then, Attarpour told them that, just as your friends have killed our comrades, we have decided to execute you—the brain behind those executions. Jazani and the others began protesting. I do not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Attarpour or Colonel Vaziri who first pulled out a machine gun and started {{shooting}} them. I do not remember whether I was the 4th or 5th person to whom they gave the machine gun. I had never done that before. At the end, Sa'di Jalil Esfahani [...] shot them in their heads [...]|$|E
2500|$|One of {{his best}} friends was fellow actor Henry Fonda, {{despite the fact that the}} two had very {{different}} political ideologies. A political argument in 1947 resulted in a fistfight, but they maintained their friendship by never discussing politics again. This tale may be apocryphal as Jhan Robbins quotes Stewart as saying: [...] "Our views never interfered with our feelings for each other, we just didn't talk about certain things. I can't remember ever having an argument with him—ever!" [...] However, Jane Fonda told Donald Dewey for his 1996 biography of Stewart that her father did have a falling out with Stewart at that time, although she did not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> because of their political differences. There is a brief reference to their political differences in character in their movie The Cheyenne Social Club. In the last years of his life, he donated to the campaign of Bob Dole in the 1996 presidential election and to Democratic Florida governor Bob Graham in his successful run for the Senate.|$|E
