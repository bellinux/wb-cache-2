5|$|Each platoon {{now had a}} Lewis gun {{section and}} a section that {{specialised}} in throwing hand-grenades (then known as bombs), each section was compelled to provide two scouts to carry out reconnaissance duties. Each platoon was expected to provide mutual fire support in the attack they were to advance, without halting; but leap <b>frogging</b> was accepted, with the lead platoon taking an objective and the following platoons passing through them and onto the next objective, while the Lewis gunners provided fire support. Grenades were used for clearing trenches and dugouts, each battalion carried forward two trench mortars to provide fire support.|$|E
500|$|After the Yankees' {{loss to the}} Reds, owner George Steinbrenner {{committed}} to sign marquee free agent Reggie Jackson to help win a championship. The Yankees, Red Sox, and Baltimore Orioles would keep leap <b>frogging</b> each other the entire year during the division race. The Yankees would win the division {{for the second year}} in a row, while the Orioles and Red Sox finished tied for second, [...] games behind the Yankees. Jackson's entry onto the Yankees initially had caused a lot of friction on them. In the middle game of what would prove to be a three-game series sweep by the Red Sox at Fenway Park, Yankees manager Billy Martin pulled Reggie Jackson off the field in mid-inning for failing to hustle on a ball hit to the outfield. The extremely angry and highly animated Martin had to be restrained by coaches Yogi Berra and Elston Howard from getting into a fistfight with Jackson in the dugout during the nationally televised Saturday afternoon game. Eventually, emotions calmed down for the season and the Yankees came together to recapture the pennant and defeat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1977 World Series, their first since [...]|$|E
2500|$|If {{they are}} not secured, the loops of a knitted course will come undone when their yarn is pulled; {{this is known as}} ripping out, {{unravelling}} knitting, or humorously, <b>frogging</b> (because you 'rip it', this sounds like a frog croaking: 'rib-bit'). To secure a stitch, at least one new loop is passed through it. Although the new stitch is itself unsecured ("active" [...] or [...] "live"), it secures the stitch(es) suspended from it. A sequence of stitches in which each stitch is suspended from the next is called a wale. To secure the initial stitches of a knitted fabric, a method for casting on is used; to secure the final stitches in a wale, one uses a method of binding/casting off. During knitting, the active stitches are secured mechanically, either from individual hooks (in knitting machines) or from a knitting needle or frame in hand-knitting.|$|E

60|$|At {{the mouth}} of the den she stepped aside, and the young filed in out of sight one after another. The mother looked and listened for a moment, then scuttled away through the woods as a clear tremulous whinny came {{floating}} in through the twilight. A moment later I saw her on the shore of the pond with a larger coon, her mate probably, who had been asleep in another hollow tree by himself; and the two went off along the shore <b>frogging</b> and fishing together.|$|E
6000|$|So {{the night}} wore on, with Kagax killing in every thicket, yet never {{satisfied}} with killing. He thought longingly {{of the hard}} winter, when game was scarce, and {{he had made his}} way out over the snow to the settlement, and lived among the chicken coops. [...] "Twenty big hens in one roost--that was killing," [...] snarled Kagax savagely, as he strangled two young herons in their nest, while the mother bird went on with her <b>frogging,</b> not ten yards away among the lily pads, and never heard a rustle.|$|E
60|$|Over {{against my}} tenting place {{a colony of}} herons had their nests in some dark hemlocks. They were {{interesting}} as a camp of gypsies, some going off in straggling bands to the coast at daybreak, others <b>frogging</b> in the streams, and a few solitary, patient, philosophical ones joining me daily in following the gentle art of Izaak Walton. And then, when the sunset came and the deep red glowed just behind the hemlocks, and the gypsy bands came home, I would see their sentinels posted here and there among the hemlock tips--still, dark, graceful silhouettes etched in sepia against the gorgeous after-glow--and hear the mothers croaking their ungainly babies {{to sleep in the}} tree tops.|$|E

60|$|Before {{the young}} were fully grown, and while {{yet they were}} {{following}} the mother to learn the ways of <b>frogging</b> and fishing, a startling thing occurred which made me ever afterwards look up to Quoskh with honest admiration. I was still-fishing {{in the middle of}} the big lake, one late afternoon, when Quoskh and her little ones sailed over the trees from the beaver pond and lit on a grassy shore. A shallow little brook stole into the lake there, and Mother Quoskh left her young to frog for themselves, while she went fishing up the brook under the alders. I was watching the young herons through my glass when I saw a sudden rush in the tall grass near them. All three humped themselves, heron fashion, on the instant. Two got away safely; the other had barely spread his wings when a black animal leaped out of the grass for his neck and pulled him down, flapping and croaking desperately.|$|E
60|$|When I saw {{the young}} again {{they were taking}} their first lessons. A dismal croaking in the tree-tops {{attracted}} me, and I came over cautiously to see what my herons were doing. The young were standing {{up on the big}} nest, stretching necks and wings, and croaking hungrily; while the mother stood on a tree-top some distance away, showing them food and telling them plainly, in heron language, to come and get it. They tried it after much coaxing and croaking; but their long, awkward toes missed their hold upon the slender branch on which she was balancing delicately--just as she expected it to happen. As they fell, flapping lustily, she shot down ahead of them and led them in a long, curving slant to an open spot on the shore. There she fed them with the morsels she held in her beak; brought more food from a tuft of grass where she had hidden it, near at hand; praised them with gurgling croaks till they felt some confidence on their awkward legs; then the whole family started up the shore on their first <b>frogging</b> expedition.|$|E
60|$|The resemblances are deliciously exact. There {{you have}} the wily Boeotain and the wily Jim Smiley waiting--two {{thousand}} years apart--and waiting, each equipped with his frog and 'laying' for the stranger. A contest is proposed--for money. The Athenian would take a chance 'if the other would fetch him a frog'; the Yankee says: 'I'm only a stranger here, and I ain't got a frog; but if I had a frog I'd bet you.' The wily Boeotian and the wily Californian, with that vast gulf of two thousand years between, retire eagerly and go <b>frogging</b> in the marsh; the Athenian and the Yankee remain behind and work a best advantage, the one with pebbles, the other with shot. Presently the contest began. In the one case 'they pinched the Boeotian frog'; in the other, 'him and the feller touched up the frogs from behind.' The Boeotian frog 'gathered himself for a leap' (you can just see him!), but 'could not move his body in the least'; the Californian frog 'give a heave, but it warn't no use--he couldn't budge.' In both the ancient and the modern cases the strangers departed with the money. The Boeotian and the Californian wonder what is the matter with their frogs; they lift them and examine; they turn them upside down and out spills the informing ballast.|$|E

50|$|Note: Frequency <b>frogging</b> is {{accomplished}} by having modulators, which are integrated into specially designed repeaters, translate a low-frequency group to a high-frequency group, and vice versa. A channel {{will appear in the}} low group for one repeater section and will then be translated to the high group for the next section because of frequency <b>frogging.</b> This results in nearly constant attenuation with frequency over two successive repeater sections, and eliminates the need for large slope equalization and adjustments. Singing and crosstalk are minimized because the high-level output of a repeater is at a different frequency than the low-level input to other repeaters. It also diminishes group delay distortion. A repeater that receives on the high band from both direction and sends on the low band is called Hi-Lo; the other kind Lo-Hi.|$|E
