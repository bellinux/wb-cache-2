25|$|Over {{the first}} two years of her mandate, Jean {{embarked}} on the traditional viceregal tours of Canada's provinces and territories. In British Columbia, Jean presented the Grey Cup at the 93rd Canadian Football League championship game; in Iqaluit, Nunavut, she opened the Toonik Tyme Festival, where she donated eighty books in Inuktitut, French, and English to the Centennial Library in commemoration of Queen Elizabeth II's 80th birthday; and, on May 4, 2006, she became the first governor general to address the Alberta legislature. During these tours, Jean also focused strongly on the plight of female victims of violence, meeting with representatives of women's organisations, such as when, in 2007, she participated in a historic private discussion with aboriginal women chiefs and elders at Saskatchewan's Government House. In contrast to her low approval ratings prior to her appointment, crowds were large and welcoming wherever Jean went.

500|$|Amy Westcott is {{credited}} as the costume designer and received several award nominations. A publicized controversy arose regarding {{the question of}} who had designed 40 ballet costumes for Portman and the dancers. An article in the British newspaper The Independent suggested those costumes had actually been created by Rodarte's Kate and Laura Mulleavy. Westcott challenged that view and stated that in all only 7 costumes, among them the black and white swan, had been created in a collaboration between Rodarte, Westcott, and Aronofsky. Furthermore, the corps ballet's costumes were designed by Zack Brown (for the American Ballet Theatre), and slightly adapted by Westcott and her costume design department. Westcott said: [...] "Controversy is too complimentary a word <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> using their considerable self-publicising resources to loudly complain about their credit once they realized how good the film is." ...|$|E

In an interview with Nashville.com, Aldean revealed that the song was not originally presented to him as a duet.

500|$|William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet {{inspired}} the lyrics for [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)". Initially Yorke {{wanted to work}} lines from the play into the song, but the final draft of the lyrics became a broad summary of the narrative. He said: [...] "I saw the Zeffirelli version when I was 13 and I cried my eyes out, because I couldn't understand why, the morning after they shagged, they didn't just run away. It's a song <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> who should run away before all the bad stuff starts." [...] Yorke compared {{the opening of the}} song, which mostly features his singing paired with acoustic guitar, to Johnny Cash's At Folsom Prison. Mellotron choir and other electronic voices are used throughout the track. The song climaxes with the entrance of drums and distorted bass run through a fuzz pedal. The climactic portion of the song is an attempt to emulate the sound of trip hop group Portishead, but in a style that bass player Colin Greenwood called more [...] "stilted and leaden and mechanical". The song concludes by fading back to Yorke's voice, acoustic guitar and Mellotron.|$|E
