50|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, tatting needles became commercially {{available}} {{in a variety of}} sizes, from <b>fingering</b> <b>yarn</b> down to size 80 tatting thread. Few patterns are written specifically for needle tatting; some shuttle tatting patterns may be used without modification. There are currently two manufacturers of tatting needles.|$|E
30|$|Each <b>finger</b> has electro-conductive <b>yarn,</b> {{and each}} {{resistance}} {{is measured by}} the AD converter of MCU. Additionally, these values are sent to PC where the functions {{of the relationship between the}} resistance of each electro-conductive yarn and joint angle are calibrated according to the method discussed in the previous section. The PC estimates the tip position of fingers using Eqs. (4)–(5); then, the estimated shape of fingers and tip position are displayed as Fig.  12. The estimated grasping state and the value of estimated diameter of grasping object are displayed, too. In this research, threshold values for estimation grasping state D_grasp and D_failed are defined as 70 and 30. The measuring sampling time of the resistance is 0.5  s, and approximated diameter of grasping object and tip position of fingers are uploaded in 0.5  s.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, a novel {{method was}} {{presented}} for estimating the grasping state of a printable soft gripper using electro-conductive yarn. Electro-conductive yarn is a conductive material. The {{resistance of the}} electro-conductive yarn is changed by stretching the strings. This characteristic is used for estimating the fingertip positions of the printable soft gripper. It is less expensive than other sensors for measuring bending motion. Additionally, it is simple to apply and disassemble a <b>finger.</b> Electro-conductive <b>yarn</b> is applied to top surface of a printable soft gripper. When a printable soft gripper is utilized for grasping, the electro-conductive yarn extends. Then, {{the resistance of the}} electro-conductive yarn changes. In our proposed estimation method, the grasping state of the printable soft gripper is estimated from this resistance. The calibration method for the estimation setup is also proposed. Several types of polynomial functions are verified experimentally. Then, the estimation results are compared against the average error. From the comparison results, a linear equation is selected for the proposed calibration method. Finally, the electro-conductive yarn is applied to the prototype of a printable soft gripper, and our proposed estimation method is experimentally verified. From results of the experiment, the estimated grasping states from resistance values of the electro-conductive yarn were validated by the actual conditions of the gripper. Consequently, the proposed method using the electro-conductive yarn was successful for estimating the grasping state of the printable soft gripper. In this study, the estimation time is not optimized and the hysteresis effect is not solved. We will solve these problems, and the estimation speed will be increased in the next step of this research.|$|R
