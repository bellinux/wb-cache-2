Round Table- Online Pioneers: The Buzz Never Stops", Espuelas {{explained}} his approach: [...] "I {{spent a lot}} of time learning how Winston Churchill ran the Second World War. I bring that up as a metaphor—not having information, not having clarity, the stakes being very high. Of course, the stakes he had to deal with were somewhat higher than what we have to do. But that was part of the encouragement—to think that something so important could be managed, and all the mistakes that were made and the chaos of the moment. And the other thing, which he said, which I love as a philosophy, is: You don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> right all the time. You just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> right 51 percent of the time, and that will carry you through. And that's a very, very liberating philosophy." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{very much}} wanted one of the sorry old tables which the prisoners had spent so many years in ornamenting with their pocket-knives, but red tape was in the way. The {{custodian}} could not sell one without an order from a superior; and that superior would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> from HIS superior; and this one would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> from a higher one--and so on up and up until the faculty should sit on the matter and deliver final judgment. The system was right, and nobody could find fault with it; {{but it did not}} seem justifiable to bother so many people, so I proceeded no further. It might have cost me more than I could afford, anyway; for one of those prison tables, which was at the time in a private museum in Heidelberg, was afterward sold at auction for two hundred and fifty dollars. It was not worth more than a dollar, or possibly a dollar and half, before the captive students began their work on it. Persons who saw it at the auction said it was so curiously and wonderfully carved that it was worth the money that was paid for it.|$|E

6000|$|That's {{the story}} of my story, and to the {{question}} in [...] your publisher's practical mind, I'm sorry to have to [...] say I don't know. I have no way of finding out, since [...] children are not accustomed to write to authors to tell [...] them what they think of their books. And after all [...] these excuses it just occurs to me that children do not [...] read forewords and introductions; they have to be addressed [...] to adults who do not read children's books, so [...] that in any case it would be thrown away. Still if a [...] foreword you must have, and from me, I think you will [...] <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> out of this letter.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My {{assurance}} {{that it was}} absolutely certain that the lady in question was in entire ignorance of the whole affair, and was {{as much in the}} dark as we were as to the author of the letter, was received by him with incredulity. [...] "I have been concerned in cases like this, or at least a good deal like it, a dozen--or, I might say, a score--of times. In every case the lady maintained stoutly that she knew nothing about it, that she had never written a letter to any man whatever, and had received none previous to the one that happened to fall into the wrong hands. In three or four instances I was deceived myself, but there is no telling with women. When a man tells a lie, he either hesitates or stumbles, or he says it off {{as if it were a}} lesson he had got by heart, or else he is sulky over it, and you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> out of him bit by bit, just as if, though he had made up his mind to lie, he did not wish to tell more lies than necessary. With a woman it is altogether different. When she makes up her mind to tell a lie, she does it thoroughly. Sometimes she is indignant, sometimes she is plaintive; but, anyhow, she is so natural that she would deceive Old Nick himself. Most of them are born actresses, sir, and when they take up a part they do it with the determination of carrying it through thoroughly." [...] Of course, I told him that, whatever it might be generally, this case was altogether an exception; that it was a moral and absolute certainty that the lady had nothing to do with it, and that the investigation, when it was once undertaken, would have to proceed, say, on the line that the author of these communications was a man or a woman having a personal enmity against a lady, and instigated by a desire to annoy and pain her.|$|E
60|$|She did not answer, {{even after}} a second louder knocking, and he {{concluded}} that she was sulking. He was in too great a hurry to bother about that. He put some water on to boil and jumped into his bath which was always poured out the night before {{in order to take}} the chill off. He presumed that Mildred would cook his breakfast while he was dressing and leave it in the sitting-room. She had done that two or three times when she was out of temper. But he heard no sound of her moving, and realised that if he wanted anything to eat he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> himself. He was irritated that she should play him such a trick on a morning when he had over-slept himself. There was still no sign of her when he was ready, but he heard her moving about her room. She was evidently getting up. He made himself some tea and cut himself a couple of pieces of bread and butter, which he ate while he was putting on his boots, then bolted downstairs and along the street into the main road to catch his tram. While his eyes sought out the newspaper shops to see the war news on the placards, he thought of the scene of the night before: now that it was over and he had slept on it, he could not help thinking it grotesque; he supposed he had been ridiculous, but he was not master of his feelings; at the time they had been overwhelming. He was angry with Mildred because she had forced him into that absurd position, and then with renewed astonishment he thought of her outburst and the filthy language she had used. He could not help flushing when he remembered her final jibe; but he shrugged his shoulders contemptuously. He had long known that when his fellows were angry with him they never failed to taunt him with his deformity. He had seen men at the hospital imitate his walk, not before him as they used at school, but when they thought he was not looking. He knew now that they did it from no wilful unkindness, but because man is naturally an imitative animal, and because it was an easy way to make people laugh: he knew it, but he could never resign himself to it.|$|E
