The parameter estimation is performed using maximum likelihood method to obtain, as an intermediate result, a latent variable estimation {{of the informal}} <b>economy</b> <b>size.</b> This procedure is new, as the estimate {{of the size of}} the informal economy using a dynamic structural model represents an alternative study area to latent variable models which assume relationships without a strong support in theory (MIMIC models). The results suggest that the size of the informal economy represents 60 % of Bolivian GDP in 2010 and that the trend has been decreasing in the last decade. In addition, we simulated four alternative policies to reduce the size of the underground economy. Some of them allow to identify surprising response mechanisms which allows to analyze the flow of workers from the informal sector into the formal sector and vice versa. The research, besides quantifying the informal <b>economy</b> <b>size,</b> tries to provide a tool and methodology for evaluating alternative policy scenarios related to fiscal policy and labor mobility in a framework of an economy with a large informal sector and evasion. ...|$|E
40|$|Data from North Dakota {{farmers are}} used to develop {{regression}} equations estimat-ing seasonal use of farm operator labor and management time by farm size. Management time has a large fixed component and increases linearly with farm size. Annual labor supervision time per man-month supervised increases when more than 15 man-months of hired or family labor are used. <b>Economies</b> of farm <b>size</b> continue {{to be an important}} question facing agricultural economists. Farmers need to know the ex-tent of <b>size</b> <b>economies</b> in planning profitable sized units. Consumers are interested from the standpoint of efficiency of food produc-tion. Rural communities are concerned when the results of farm <b>size</b> <b>economies</b> reduce the population of both farm people and those providing services to farmers.

One problem when using data from actual farm firms is that managerial quality tends to increase with farm size, thereby con-founding management effects with pure <b>economies</b> of farm <b>size.</b> The synthetic firm approach enables one to measure pure <b>size</b> <b>economies</b> since the quality of management can be held constant by specifying uniform production practices and yields [Madden, p. 29].

Under the parametric approach, a random parameter translog cost system and a translog cost frontier are constructed and estimated respectively. The results from the cost system estimation suggest that on average, cow-calf production in Alberta exhibits <b>Economies</b> of <b>Size,</b> technical progress and positive TFP. However, exploitable <b>Economies</b> of <b>Size</b> decrease over time, technical change rate and TFP even become negative at 2002. The critical problem, therefore, is how to reverse the trend and maintain good growth pattern. The translog cost frontier is also estimated but the results are unreliable.

The size of shadow economy in Palestine is very high due to the political situation, which are a result of the Israeli occupation since 1967 and the blockade of Gaza strip. The main factors that affect the size of the shadow economy in Palestine is the ownership of businesses, an increase of ownership by 1 % to the total employment leads to an increase in the shadow <b>economy</b> <b>size</b> by 0. 57 %.
