5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the <b>frequency</b> <b>comb</b> output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the <b>frequency</b> <b>comb</b> output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, a conceptually {{simple way}} to make an optical <b>frequency</b> <b>comb</b> is to take two {{high-power}} lasers of slightly different frequency and shine them simultaneously through a photonic-crystal fiber. This creates a <b>frequency</b> <b>comb</b> by four-wave mixing as described above.|$|E
25|$|An optical <b>frequency</b> <b>comb</b> can be {{generated}} by modulating the amplitude and/or phase of a continuous-wave laser with an external modulator driven by a radio-frequency source. In this manner, the <b>frequency</b> <b>comb</b> is centered around the optical frequency provided by the continuous-wave laser and the modulation frequency or repetition rate is given by the external radio-frequency source. The advantage of this method {{is that it can}} reach much higher repetition rates (>10GHz) than with mode-locked lasers and the two degrees of freedom of the comb can be set independently. The number of lines is lower than with a mode-locked laser (typically a few tens), but the bandwidth can be significantly broadened with nonlinear fibers. This type of optical <b>frequency</b> <b>comb</b> is usually called electrooptic <b>frequency</b> <b>comb.</b> The first schemes used a phase modulator inside an integrated Fabry–Perot cavity, but with advances in electro-optic modulators new arrangements are possible.|$|E

40|$|Anomalous group {{velocity}} dispersion {{is a key}} parameter for generating bright solitons, and thus wideband Kerr <b>frequency</b> <b>combs.</b> Extension of <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> to visible wavelength in conventional photonic materials and structures {{has been a major}} challenge due to strong normal material dispersion at the relevant frequencies. Extension of <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> toward the normal dispersion region is possible via dispersive waves through soliton-induced Cherenkov radiation. However, this potentially powerful technique has not been used for extending <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> to the visible spectrum. In this paper, we demonstrate a new microresonator structure formed by an over-etched silicon nitride waveguide that enables the use of soliton-induced Cherenkov radiation to extend the bandwidth of the Kerr-combs. Furthermore, we show that by careful dispersion engineering in a coupled microring resonator structure we can optimize the properties (e. g., wavelength, and amplitude) of the generated dispersive wave to further extend the Kerr <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> to the visible spectrum while increasing the total Kerr-comb bandwidth as well...|$|R
40|$|Dual-comb {{spectroscopy}} {{is emerging}} {{as one of the}} most appealing applications of mid-infrared <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> for high-resolution molecular spectroscopy, as it leverages on the unique coherence properties of <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> combined with the high sensitivities achievable by mid-infrared molecular spectroscopy. Here we present an on-chip dual-comb source based on mid-infrared quantum cascade laser <b>frequency</b> <b>combs,</b> where two <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> are integrated on a single chip. Control of the combs repetition and offset frequencies is obtained by integrating micro-heaters next to each laser. We show that a full control of the dual-comb system is possible, by measuring a multi-heterodyne beating corresponding to an optical bandwidth of 32 cm^- 1 at a center frequency of 1330 cm^- 1 (7. 52 μm), demonstrating that this device is ideal for compact dual-comb spectroscopy systems...|$|R

2500|$|An {{alternative}} to stabilizing the carrier–envelope offset frequency is to cancel it completely {{by use of}} difference frequency generation (DFG). If the difference frequency of light of opposite ends of a broadened spectrum is generated in a nonlinear crystal, the resulting <b>frequency</b> <b>comb</b> is carrier–envelope offset-free since the two spectral parts contributing to the DFG share the same carrier–envelope offset frequency. This was first proposed in 1999 [...] and recently demonstrated using an erbium fiber <b>frequency</b> <b>comb</b> at the telecom wavelength.

40|$|Precise {{measurements}} of the frequencies of light waves have become common with mode-locked laser <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> 1. Despite their huge success, optical <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> currently remain bulky and expensive laboratory devices. Integrated photonic microresonators are promising candidates for comb generators in out-of-the-lab applications, {{with the potential for}} reductions in cost, power consumption and size. Such advances will significantly impact fields ranging from spectroscopy and trace gas sensing to astronomy, communications and atomic time-keeping. Yet, in spite of the remarkable progress shown over recent years, microresonator <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> (‘microcombs’) have been without the key function of direct f– 2 f self-referencing, which enables precise determination of the absolute <b>frequency</b> of each <b>comb</b> line.

2500|$|An {{alternative}} {{variation of}} four-wave-mixing-based frequency combs {{is known as}} Kerr <b>frequency</b> <b>comb.</b> Here, a single laser is coupled into a microresonator (such as a microscopic glass disk that has whispering-gallery modes). This kind of structure naturally has a series of resonant modes with approximately equally spaced frequencies (similar to a Fabry–Pérot interferometer). Unfortunately the resonant modes are not exactly equally spaced due to dispersion. Nevertheless, the four-wave mixing effect above can create and stabilize a perfect <b>frequency</b> <b>comb</b> in such a structure. Basically, the system generates a perfect comb that overlaps the resonant modes as much as possible. In fact, nonlinear effects can shift the resonant modes to improve the overlap with the perfect comb even more.
