Apple fruit in Chile are {{primarily}} produced for export to Asia, Europe, and the United States, which typically requires 15 to 40 days of maritime transportation. Therefore, Chilean apple production must fulfill the sanitization requirements {{imposed by the}} receiving countries. Under these circumstances, {{it was important to}} clarify the etiology of bull's <b>eye</b> <b>rot</b> that can severely affect 'Cripps Pink' apple and other late-harvest cultivars in Chile. Based on morphological characteristics and the partial sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer sequences and beta-tubulin genes, Neofabraea alba was identified as the causal agent of the bull's <b>eye</b> <b>rot</b> of Chilean apple. These results were further corroborated using species-specific primers. The incidence of bull's <b>eye</b> <b>rot</b> varied considerably; for instance, in 2009, 0. 0 to 58. 7 % in 38 Cripps Pink orchards surveyed in the relatively arid and humid apple-growing areas of Chile, respectively. There was no evidence for the presence of N. malicorticis or N. perennans, which are commonly identified as causal agents of bull's <b>eye</b> <b>rot</b> in other apple-producing countries. Altogether, these data suggest that N. alba might represent the predominant and possibly the only cause of bull's-eye rot of Chilean apple...|$|E

N. alba, N. perennans and N. sp. nova were identified in isolates obtained from bull's <b>eye</b> <b>rot</b> on pear fruit, using species-specific primers in a PCR reaction. N. alba was also found to be associated with naturally occurring small cankers and pruning stubs on pear trees. Pear trees were inoculated at monthly intervals with mycelia of N. alba and N. perennans to determine susceptibility to canker formation. Susceptibility was highest during autumn and winter months, with larger cankers bearing conspicuous acervuli produced after inoculations from October to February. Small cankers resulted from conidial inoculations with N. perennans on superficially wounded pear branches. Cankers induced after mycelial inoculations sporulated throughout the year with highest amounts of conidia produced from September to December. Pear fruit became naturally infected throughout the growing season, with increasing infection levels close to harvest. Contradictory effects of temperature on bull's <b>eye</b> <b>rot</b> development by N. perennans were observed between 2001 and 2002, where the highest levels of disease were found at 10 °C and at 30 °C, respectively. Wetness duration did not affect bull's <b>eye</b> <b>rot</b> development, while the concentration of conidia correlated positively with disease development. Over-tree irrigation and late harvest resulted in higher disease levels than under-tree irrigation and early to mid season harvest.

60|$|Many evils {{have been}} overcome, much order and beauty and scope for living has been evolved since {{man was a}} hairy savage holding {{scarcely}} more than a brute's intercourse with his fellows; {{but even in the}} comparatively short perspective of history, one can scarcely deny a steady process of overcoming evil. One may sneer at contemporary things; it is a fashion with that unhappily trained type of mind which cannot appreciate without invidious comparison, so poor in praise that it cannot admit worth without venting a compensatory envy; but of one permanent result of progress surely every one is assured. In the matter of thoughtless and instinctive cruelty--and that is a very fundamental matter--mankind mends steadily. I wonder and doubt if in the whole world at any time before this an aged, ill-clad woman, or a palpable cripple could have moved among a crowd of low-class children as free from combined or even isolated insult as such a one would be to-day, if caught in the rush from a London Council school. Then, for all our sins, I am sure the sense of justice is quicker and more nearly universal than ever before. Certain grave social evils, too, that once seemed innate in humanity, have gone, gone so effectually that we cannot now imagine ourselves subjected to them; the cruelties and insecurities of private war, the duel, overt slavery, for example, have altogether ceased; and in all Western Europe and America chronic local famines and great pestilences come no more. No doubt it is still an unsatisfactory world that mars the roadside with tawdry advertisements of drugs and food; but less than two centuries ago, remember, the place of these boards was taken by gibbets and crow-pecked, tattered corpses swinging in the wind, and the heads of dead gentlemen (drawn and quartered, and their bowels burnt before their <b>eyes)</b> <b>rotted</b> in the rain on Temple Bar.|$|R

40|$|Pear (Pyrus communis L.) is an {{important}} fruit crop in the Netherlands, with a total production of 349, 000 tons in 2014, and ‘Conference’ is the main cultivar. In the Netherlands, pears are kept in controlled atmosphere cold storage up to 11 months after harvest. Symptoms of bull’s <b>eye</b> <b>rot</b> were observed in 2015 on ‘Conference’ pears in storage in the Netherlands. Bull’s eye lesions on apple and pear fruits are generally caused by four Neofabraea species: N. alba Jacks, N. malicorticis Guthrie, N. perennans Kienholz, and N. kienholzii Seifert, Spotts & Lévesque (Gariepy et al. 2005). N. alba is the major pathogen causing bull’s <b>eye</b> <b>rot</b> on pear fruits in the Netherlands. Independent of the species, the symptoms appear as flat or slightly sunken lesions, which are brown, often lighter brown in the center (Spotts et al. 2009). To isolate the causal agent, fruit were rinsed with sterile water, lesions were sprayed with 70 % ethanol until droplet runoff, the skin was removed aseptically with a scalpel, and tissue under the lesion was isolated and placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA). PDA plates were incubated at 20 °C in the dark, and single spores were transferred to fresh PDA plates. The isolates produced colonies with white-yellowish to brownish mycelium. Microconidia were produced on feathery fascicles of aerial mycelium, with a white, powdery, or sugary appearance {{on the surface of}} the agar colony. Microconidia were 2. 5 to 6. 5 × 1. 5 to 2. 5 µm, ellipsoidal, slightly asymmetrical to a curved form. The identity of a representative isolate (PPO 45010) was confirmed by means of multilocus gene sequencing. To this end, genomic DNA was extracted using the LGC Mag Plant Kit (Berlin) in combination with the Kingfisher method (Waltham, MA). Segments of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), 28 S ribosomal RNA (28 S rRNA) and beta-tubulin (TUB 2) loci were amplified, sequenced with primers ITS 1 /ITS 4, LR 0 R/LR 5, and Btub 2 Fd/Btub 4 Rd (Chen et al. 2016), and deposited in GenBank under accession nos. KX 424942 (ITS), KX 424941 (28 S rRNA), and KX 424940 (TUB 2). MegaBLAST analysis revealed that the ITS, 28 S rRNA, and TUB 2 sequences matched with 99 to 100 % identity to N. kienholzii isolates in GenBank (KR 859082 and KR 859083 [ITS], KR 858873 and KR 858874 [28 S rRNA], KR 859288 and KR 859289 [TUB 2]). Alcohol surface sterilized fruits were inoculated in pathogenicity tests in two ways: (i) with an agar disk (10 mm diameter) with actively growing mycelium of N. kienholzii prepared from a 14 -day-old culture grown on PDA; and (ii) with 20 μl of a spore suspension (10 5 conidia ml - 1) prepared from a 21 -day-old PDA culture after wounding with a needle. Both experiments were performed on 10 ‘Conference’ pears. Inoculated fruits were sealed in plastic bags and were incubated in darkness at 20 °C. Typical symptoms appeared between 7 and 14 days. Mock-inoculated controls with water and PDA-only controls remained symptomless. Fungi isolated from the lesions had morphological characteristics that resembled the original isolates from infected pears. The identity of these isolates was confirmed as N. kienholzii by sequencing, thus completing Koch’s postulates. Bull’s <b>eye</b> <b>rot</b> of apple and pear is {{an important}} postharvest disease, occurring in major fruit growing areas of North America, Chile, Australia, and Europe (Henriquez et al. 2004; Spotts et al. 2009).

Os experimentos foram realizados em Vacaria-RS, nos ciclos 2006 / 07 e 2007 / 08. Na fase de dormência de macieiras Pink Lady®, foram aplicados os seguintes tratamentos erradicantes (dose p. i.) : calda sulfocálcica (3, 0 %); oxicloreto de cobre (0, 5 %); hidróxido de cobre (0, 3 %); óxido cuproso (0, 3 %) e testemunha sem pulverização. A redução do inóculo foi avaliada em solução oriunda da lavagem de ramos, gemas floríferas e frutos, semeados em meio semisseletivo. Na colheita, a incidência da POB foi avaliada em quatro categorias de frutos: caídos sob a área de projeção da copa; nas plantas; infecções latentes, e após três meses de armazenamento em câmara frigorífica. Houve relação linear positiva entre os níveis de inóculo de Cryptosporiopsis sp. em gemas e os danos por POB (R 2 = 0, 948; P = 0, 001). O uso da calda sulfocálcica possibilitou a maior redução de inóculo nas gemas, com redução em 50 % dos danos totais ocasionados por POB na safra de 2006 / 07. Nos frutos, o inóculo apresentou um incremento linear ao longo do ciclo, sendo relativamente maior em 2007 / 08, onde os tratamentos erradicantes possibilitaram controle {{superior}} a 40 % nos danos com benefício econômico pela redução do inóculo. Aiming {{to evaluate}} {{strategies for the}} control of bull’s <b>eye</b> <b>rot</b> (BER) based on the reduction of initial inoculum the following fungicide treatments were applied in experimental plots established in 2006 / 07 and 2007 / 08 seasons in Vacaria - RS, southern of Brazil. During the plant dormancy period it was applied: lime sulfur (3. 0 %); copper oxychloride (0. 5 %); copper hydroxide (0. 3 %); and cuprous oxide (0. 3 %). The check treatment consisted of non sprayed plots. Branches of one and two years and floral buds were sampled and the associated inoculum recovered with a semi-selective media to evaluate {{the effect of the}} treatments on inoculum reduction. During harvest, BER incidence on fruits was evaluated in four categories of fruits: i) fallen on the ground under the projection of the canopy; ii) in the plants; iii) harvested (for the detection of latent infections); and iv) harvested and stored for three months in a cold chamber. A linear relationship was observed between inoculum levels of Cryptosporiopsis sp. on buds and total losses by BER (R 2 = 0. 948; P = 0. 001). Applications of lime sulfur promoted the most reduction of inoculum on buds and 50 % of reduction of total losses by bull’s <b>eye</b> <b>rot,</b> differing significantly from the other treatments in 2006 / 07 season.

The aqueous dilution was {{more effective than the}} ethanol dilution. Both dilutions inhibited mycelial growth of N. alba to a similar extent but no trend in data was noted across the concentration range. Calculated EC 50 values indicated that 13. 36 % and 8. 09 % aqueous dilutions could be used to inhibit growth of B. cinerea and P. expansum, respectively; however, values generated for N. alba either bordered on or exceeded the concentration range. The volatile vapour application of garlic was able to inhibit mycelial growth and spore germination of all pathogens at concentrations as low as 20 %. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis showed that 85. 95 % of compounds present in the garlic sample belonged to a sulphur or sulphur-derived group. Allicin, the active component of garlic, was not found; however, breakdown products of allicin were present in high amounts. Overall, the antifungal activity of garlic extracts for the control of B. cinerea and P. expansum was confirmed.

40|$|Post-harvest {{diseases}} of apple and pear result in significant economic losses during long storage. Pathogens causing quiescent infections {{in the orchard}} leading to late post-harvest losses in The Netherlands are Neofabraea alba (Lenticel spot disease), N. perennans (Bull <b>eye</b> <b>rot),</b> Neonectria galligena (Nectria rot), Phytophthora spp., Alternaria spp., Fusarium spp., Cadophora spp. (Phialophora spp.) and Stemphylium vesicarium. Knowledge on the occurrence of the different post-harvest diseases and their epidemiology is very limited. The objectives of our project were to develop tools for the quantitative species-specific detection of pathogens in environmental samples; to study the population dynamics of pathogens in orchards; and to identify major inoculum sources of the different pathogens. Species-specific primers and probes {{have been developed for}} three main pathogens N. alba, N. perennans and Cadophora luteo-olivacea. The amount of DNA of each of the three pathogens can now be quantified in environmental samples using TaqMan-PCR assays. Samples of various necrotic plant residues and tree parts were collected in 10 apple and 10 pear orchards during the growing season 2012 to investigate their role as potential inoculum source. In all orchard samples were taken monthly from May until September and in December 2012 from 4 plots (replicates). Neofabraea alba and C. luteo-olivacea were found in all orchards whereas N. perennans occurred only occasionally. Neofabraea alba and C. luteo-olivacea were present on necrotic tissues of apple and pear such as mummies, cankers, and dead leaves. Interestingly, the pathogens were also found in varying amounts on necrotic tissues of other plant species present on the orchard floors.

Fruit infection occurs in the orchard, but disease symptoms appear only 3 months after harvest, during refrigerated storage. In Italy BER is particularly serious for late harvest apple cultivar as ‘Pink Lady™’. The purposes of this thesis were: i) Evaluate the influence of ‘Pink Lady™’ apple primary metabolites in N. alba quiescence ii) Evaluate the influence of pH in five different apple cultivars on BER susceptibility iii) To find out not chemical method to control N. alba infection iv) Identify some fungal volatile compounds in order to use them as N. alba infections markers. Results regarding the role of primary metabolites showed that chlorogenic, quinic and malic acid inhibit N. alba development. The study based on the evaluation of cultivar susceptibility, showed that Granny Smith was the most resistant apple cultivar among the varieties analyzed. Moreover, Granny Smith showed the lowest pH value from harvest until the end of storage, supporting the thesis that ambient pH could be involved in the interaction between N. alba and apple. In order to find out new technologies able to improve lenticel rot management, the application of a non-destructive device for the determination of chlorophyll content was applied. Results showed that fruit with higher chlorophyll content are less susceptible to BER, and molecular analyses comforted this result. Fruits with higher chlorophyll content showed up-regulation of PGIP and HCT, genes involved in plant defence. Through the application of PTR-MS and SPME GC-MS, 25 volatile organic compounds emitted by N. alba were identified. Among them, 16 molecules were identified as potential biomarkers...|$|E

The knowledge of new grapevine's cultivars {{responses to these}} factors within the growing season contributes {{to improve the quality}} of the wines produced in a specific region. Thus, traditional grapevines hybrids and new attainments were evaluated in Caldas, Minas Gerais conditions. The study was carried out from 1999 to 2002 using eight grafted on RR 101 - 14 rootstock cultivars grown at Epamig Experimental Farm vineyard in Caldas, MG, also cultivated in vertical system. The agronomic variables studied were: sprouting, blooming and ripening phenologic phases, total yield per vine, titratable acidity and total soluble solids in berries, and the incidence of bird's <b>eye</b> <b>rot</b> and downy mildew. The cycle from budding to harvest ranged from 147 days ('Seyve Villard 5276 ') to 169 days ('Seibel 10173 '). Clusters of hybrids 'G 159 OC 32258 ', 'G 159 OC 32458 ' and 'Seyve Villard 5276 ' were earlier harvested while 'Moscato Embrapa' and 'Baco blanc' delayed the ripening and had later harvest. Total yield per vine were higher than 10. 4 kg. pl- 1 for 'Couderc 13 ' followed by the 'Baco blanc' (9. 27 kg. pl- 1), 'Moscato Embrapa' (7. 94 kg. pl- 1) and 'G 159 OC 32458 ' (7. 04 kg. pl- 1) and were significantly lower for 'Seibel 10173 ' and 'G 159 0 C 32258 ' (3. 56 kg. pl- 1). Soluble solids ranged from 14. 63 ºBrix for 'Couderc 13 ' to 19. 23 ºBrix for the 'G 159 OC 32258 ' hybrid, and the values of titrable acidity in the ripe berries ranged from 91. 7 meq.

40|$|Introduction: High {{efficiency}} and low cost of homeopathic drugs, lack {{of side effects}} and accumulation of toxins in animal farming products made homeopathy one of the priority developments in veterinary medicine. However, opponents of homeopathy have intensified their activity in the recent years. The attacks of the opponents of homeopathy, with their unfounded claims that it is totally explained by the placebo effect, can largely be explained by complexity of understanding the mechanism of action of these remedies which does not fit into the established concepts the effect of drugs on the body. That is why further study of homeopathic phenomenon is especially important in these days. In order to disproof the opinion that homeopathic phenomenon is explained by placebo effect, {{we have been studying}} the effect homeopathic remedies on vegetable growth and ripening. This choice was based on the hope that the opponents of homeopathy {{would not be able to}} accuse plants of self-suggestion under the effect of potentiated remedies. There are many publications about application of homeopathic remedies on plants. For example, in this direction such researchers as Stephan Baumgartner, Carneiro SMTPG, Rossi F, Carvalho LM, Bonato CM, Betti L, Lazzarato L V. Majewsky, and other researchers worked. &# 13; Methods: Our first experiments that we performed during two years demonstrated a significant improvement of growth and ripening variables when homeopathic remedies were added to fertilizing mixtures, as compared with conventional plant care. Tomatoes of Typhoon F 1 and Titan breeds were sued to study the effect of homeopathic remedies on plant growth and ripening. The studies were performed in greenhouse conditions in summer 2009 and 2010, on fertile soils of an experimental farm in the Krasnoselskiy district of the Leningrad region. Every study group of a certain tomato breed contained 20 plants. When the young plants were planted in the soil they were watered with adding Coca 1000 ÃÂ¡ÃÂ remedy, and then in one month the upper part of the plant was sprayed with Echinacea 30 ÃÂ¡ÃÂ. The same amounts of similar plants of the same breeds treated according to conventional agricultural technology were used as a control group. &# 13; Results: As a result earlier ripening was found in the Typhoon F 1 tomato breed: it occurred by 19 days earlier: that is by 18. 3 % than in the control group. The Titan tomatoes group ripened by 14. 3 % faster than in the control one. Every plant of the Typhoon breed produced an average of 45 tomato fruits, while in the control group the average number amounted to 14 (i. e. there was an increase of 221. 4 % in the test group). An average of 78 tomato fruits were produced by the Titan breed plants, while in the control group this number was only 20 (increase by 290 %). Mean weight of the Typhoon tomato fruit increased by 59. 5 g from the control values, i. e. by 180. 8 %. Mean weight of the Titan tomato fruit increased by 128. 5 i. e. by 208. 9 %. A notable difference was found by all observers in the taste of experimental and control vegetables. The experimental plants had significantly better taste characteristics and they were also more resistant to buck <b>eye</b> <b>rot.</b> &# 13; Conclusion: In such a way, the studies performed confirm the existence of homeopathic phenomenon in live organisms in the absence of the placebo effect. It has been demonstrated that the use of homeopathic remedies is effective in improvement of agricultural productivity. Plants are unique model for research of ultrahigh dilutions of substances...|$|E
40|$|A cultura da macieira no Brasil ocupa cerca de 35 mil {{hectares}} com uma produção que chega, em alguns anos, a 1 milhão de toneladas. Dentre os principais vírus que infectam as plantas estão os chamados latentes Apple stem grooving virus (ASGV), Apple chlorotic {{leaf spot}} virus (ACLSV) e Apple stem pitting virus (ASPV) como também o Apple mosaic virus (ApMV). Atualmente, entre as doenças fúngicas mais importantes estão à podridão de olho de boi causadas por Cryptosporiopsis perennans e a mancha foliar da gala causada por Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. O objetivo deste trabalho foi o de avaliar a predisposição em frutos e folhas da cultivar Maxi Gala com infecções virais a C. perennans e a C. gloeosporioides, respectivamente. Em frutos as infecções virais utilizadas foram: ACLSV (C), ACLSV+ ASPV+ ApMV (C+P+M), ASGV (G), ASGV + ASPV (G+P), ASGV + ACLSV + ASPV (G+C+P), ASGV + ACLSV + ASPV + ApMV (G+C+P+M). Foram analisadas nos frutos durante a colheita e após o armazenamento as variáveis de incidência e o número de lenticelas necrosadas, teor de açúcar, firmeza, escala iodo-amido, lenticelas abertas (l. a.), atividade das enzimas peroxidases (PO) e polifenol oxidase (PPO) e teor de fenóis. Em plantas com infecção do vírus ASGV foram avaliadas a incidência, número de manchas, severidade, taxa de progresso da doença, período de incubação, a atividade de enzimas PO e PPO e teor de fenóis analisadas em ramos. Os frutos com infecções virais apresentam maior predisposição a C. perennans, pois tiveram mais incidência, exceção de C, durante a colheita e após armazenamento e número de lenticelas necrosadas após o armazenamento. Os frutos com G+C+P+M apresentaram-se mais maduros e mais l. a. na colheita e após o armazenamento. Os frutos com infecção de G e G+C+P+M apresentaram menor atividade da PO, mas sem alteração da PPO ou do teor de fenóis. As plantas com ASGV apresentaram maior predisposição à infecção de C. gloeosporioides, pois apresentaram maior incidência, número de manchas, severidade e menor tempo de incubação e PPO. Apples are grown in Brazil on approximately 35 thousand hectares with a production that reaches 1 million ton in some years. The so called latent apple viruses Apple stem grooving virus (ASGV), Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV) and Apple stem pitting virus (ASPV) {{as well as}} Apple mosaic virus (ApMV) stand out as the most commonly involved in apple viral infections. Bull´s <b>eye</b> <b>rot</b> caused by Cryptosporiopsis perennans and the Gala leaf spot caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides {{are among the most}} important fungal diseases. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of viral infections on predisposing apple plants, cv. Maxi Gala, to subsequent infections by C. perennans and by C. gloeosporioides in fruits and leaves, respectively. In fruits the treatments ACLSV (C), ACLSV+ ASPV+ ApMV (C+P+M), ASGV (G), ASGV + ASPV (G+P), ASGV + ACLSV + ASPV (G+C+P), ASGV + ACLSV + ASPV + ApMV (G+C+P+M) were analyzed at harvest and after cold room storage period in relation to disease incidence, number of necrotic lenticels, sugar content, firmness, iodine-starch, lenticel opening (l. o.), the activity of peroxydases (PO), polyphenol oxydase (PPO) and the phenol content. In plants pre-infected with ASGV the incidence and the number of leafspots per leaf, severity and the rate of disease progress, incubation period of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, the activity of the enzymes PO and PPO and phenol content in twigs were analysed. The incidence of C. perennans in fruits pre-infected with viruses was higher, excepting C, in these fruits at harvest and after cold storage, and the number of necrotic lenticels was higher. Ripeness of fruits pre-infected with G+C+P+M was advanced and fruits had higher l. o. at harvest and after storage. Fruits pre-infected with G and G+C+P+M showed a lower PO activity, but their PPO activity and phenolics contents were unaltered. C. gloeosporioides had a higher infectivity on leaves of plants with ASGV,showed higher disease incidence, leafspots and disease severity and lower incubation period and activity of PPO...|$|E
