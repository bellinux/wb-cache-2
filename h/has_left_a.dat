5|$|Cesare Angelotti, former consul of the Roman Republic and now {{an escaped}} {{political}} prisoner, runs into the church and hides in the Attavanti private chapel – his sister, the Marchesa Attavanti, <b>has</b> <b>left</b> <b>a</b> key to the chapel hidden {{at the feet of}} the statue of the Madonna. The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds.|$|E
5|$|For over {{a century}} and a half, Montreal was the {{industrial}} and financial centre of Canada. This legacy <b>has</b> <b>left</b> <b>a</b> variety of buildings including factories, elevators, warehouses, mills, and refineries, that today provide an invaluable insight into the city's history, especially in the downtown area and the Old Port area. There are 50 National Historic Sites of Canada, more than any other city.|$|E

5|$|Other {{volcanic}} events elsewhere {{interacted with}} groundwater and magma creating numerous pit craters. Many of these pit craters {{have been filled}} with water creating several crater lakes. In some places glacial till and fluvial sands and gravels are maintained under the several lava flows that form the volcanic field. Paleosols are found, but are rare. Glaciation <b>has</b> <b>left</b> <b>a</b> thick blanket of till over {{nearly all of the}} volcanic deposits and therefore outcrop is largely limited to cliffforming exposures in several valleys.|$|E
5|$|The Chalk River reactor {{was shut}} down for {{maintenance}} in August 2009, and reopened in August 2010. The Petten reactor had a 6-month scheduled maintenance shutdown on Friday, February 19, 2010, and reopened September 2010. With millions of procedures relying on technetium-99m every year, the low supply <b>has</b> <b>left</b> <b>a</b> gap, leaving some practitioners to revert to techniques not used for 20 years. Somewhat allaying this issue is an announcement from the Polish Maria research reactor that they have developed a technique to isolate technetium.|$|E
5|$|Besides his {{collected}} music criticism, Shaw <b>has</b> <b>left</b> <b>a</b> varied musical legacy, {{not all of}} it of his choosing. Despite his {{dislike of}} having his work adapted for the musical theatre ("my plays set themselves to a verbal music of their own") two of his plays were turned into musical comedies: Arms and the Man was the basis of The Chocolate Soldier in 1908, with music by Oscar Straus, and Pygmalion was adapted in 1956 as My Fair Lady with book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe. Although he had a high regard for Elgar, Shaw turned down the composer's request for an opera libretto, but played a major part in persuading the BBC to commission Elgar's Third Symphony, and was the dedicatee of The Severn Suite (1930).|$|E

5|$|In Anglo-Saxon {{times the}} river formed a {{boundary}} between Wessex and Dumnonia. It later served the Port of Bridgwater, and enabled cargoes {{to be transported}} inland. The arrival of the railways led {{to a decline in}} commercial shipping, and the only working docks are at Dunball. Man's influence on the river <b>has</b> <b>left</b> <b>a</b> legacy of bridges and industrial artefacts. The Parrett along with its connected waterways and network of drains supports an ecosystem that includes several rare species of flora and fauna. The River Parrett Trail has been established {{along the banks of the}} river.|$|E
5|$|The {{boys and}} Candace {{return to a}} muddy area where the T. rex <b>has</b> <b>left</b> <b>a</b> massive footprint, which they {{recognize}} will eventually be {{on display in the}} museum in the present. Phineas leaves a message in the footprint for Isabella and the Fireside Girls to save them. The girls—in the present—immediately spot the footprint and the message and follow their handbook to create a new time machine. They use the machine to travel back in time and rescue the three. Upon arrival in the present, though, they realize a T. rex returned with them, so Candace flees and tries to expose it to her parents. A stray ray from Doofenshmirtz's machine freezes the creature, so her parents merely believe it is an exhibit.|$|E
5|$|The large {{figure of}} Jonah {{is of great}} {{significance}} to the total composition, both pictorially and theologically, being symbolic of the Risen Christ. The figure occupies the pendentive which rises from the altar wall to support the vault, and strains backward, his eyes turned towards God. The foreshortening described by Vasari was innovative and highly influential to later painters. The cleaning of this significant figure <b>has</b> <b>left</b> <b>a</b> few remnants of black shadow visible to the extreme {{left side of the}} painting. All the other, less intense, black lines and washes have been removed, lessening the impact of the radical foreshortening, and also robbing the great fish, the genii behind Jonah, and the architectural figures of much detail.|$|E

5|$|Van Peebles {{began to}} develop the film after being offered a three-picture {{contract}} for Columbia Pictures. No studio would finance the film, so Van Peebles funded the film himself, shooting it independently {{over a period of}} 19 days, performing all of his own stunts and appearing in several sex scenes, reportedly unsimulated. He received a $50,000 loan from Bill Cosby to complete the project. The film's fast-paced montages and jump-cuts were unique features in American cinema at the time. The picture was censored in some markets, and received mixed critical reviews. However, it <b>has</b> <b>left</b> <b>a</b> lasting impression on African-American cinema.|$|E
