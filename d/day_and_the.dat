5|$|Although Platt desired a recess, Hanna refused, {{wanting the}} {{convention}} to complete its work that <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> delegates proceeded {{to the presidential}} nomination. McKinley had insisted that Foraker nominate him to demonstrate {{the unity of the}} Ohio Republican Party, and after some reluctance by the senator-elect, who feared blame if anything went wrong, Foraker agreed. McKinley was waiting with family and friends at his house in Canton, being kept up to date by telegraph and telephone. He was able to listen to part of Foraker's speech, and the tremendous reception that met it, over the phone line. McKinley was easily nominated on the first ballot, with Reed his nearest competitor. Canton erupted in celebration, with McKinley making speech after speech to the townsfolk and to those who poured in that day by rail from across Ohio, even from his birthplace of Niles.|$|E
5|$|Although {{initially}} {{viewed as}} an expensive white elephant, within 10years the station was working at capacity (about 600 trains per <b>day)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> GER was acquiring land {{to the east of}} the station for expansion. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1888 and work started in 1890 on the eastward expansion of Liverpool Street by adding eight new tracks and platforms. This gave the station the most platforms of any London terminus until Victoria station was expanded in 1908.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{convection}} persisted on March24 to the east-southeast of the Marshall Islands. Initially {{it consisted}} of a broad but consolidating circulation, with outflow to the north offsetting moderate wind shear to aid in development. It gradually became better organized, with a curved area of convection wrapping into the center. On March26, the JMA classified {{the system as a}} tropical depression just east of Pohnpei. On March27, the JTWC started tracking the system as a Tropical Depression 04W. Moving west-northwestward, the system's center became more consolidated with convective banding becoming wrapped into it. The JTWC upgraded 04W to a tropical storm the same <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Maysak.|$|E

5|$|Bouvet {{spent the}} {{majority}} of her career alternating between the Northern and Mediterranean Squadrons. At the outbreak of World War I, she escorted troop convoys from North Africa to France. She then joined the naval operations off the Dardanelles, where she participated in a major attack on the Turkish fortresses in the straits on 18 March 1915.

She struck a mine at around 3:15, and sank within two minutes; only some 50 men were rescued from a complement of 710. Two British battleships were also sunk by mines that <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> disaster convinced the Allies to abandon the naval campaign {{in favor of an}} amphibious assault on Gallipoli.|$|E
5|$|By 1782 MacBride was {{operating}} in the Channel, and in April was sent out as a scout ahead of the main force under Admiral Samuel Barrington, which aimed to intercept a French squadron that had left Brest bound for the East Indies.

Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk also pursued {{a broad range of}} other variations, giving rise to post-punk and new wave and later indie pop, alternative rock, and noise rock. By the 1990s, punk rock had re-emerged in the mainstream, as pop punk bands such as Green <b>Day</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Offspring brought the genre widespread popularity.|$|E
