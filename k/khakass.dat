Baskakov participated in creation of the first bilingual Türkic-Russian and Russian-Türkic dictionaries for Uigur (1939), Altay (1947), and <b>Khakass</b> (1953), and headed the creation of Russian-Uigur (1941), Nogai-Russian (1963), Russian-Altai (1964), Russian-Karakalpak (1967) and Turkmen-Russian (1968) dictionaries. Baskakov participated in creation of first trilingual dictionaries for Türkic languages, Gagauz-Russian-Moldavian (1973), Karaim-Russian-Polish (1974). Publication of trilingual dictionaries was preceded by two his publications that established main principles of composing trilingual dictionaries (1968, 1971). The Uigur, Altai, <b>Khakass,</b> and Nogai dictionaries had brief grammatical descriptions of the languages.|$|E
40|$|My paper argues that, when {{collecting}} and re-presenting traditions based on orality, {{we need to}} consider the challenges of transferring from one medium to another, for instance, from sounds experienced within a performance complex to a potentially isolated written text or recording. Drawing on fieldwork among Altaians and <b>Khakasses</b> of the southern Siberian Altai-Sayan mountains, I illustrate the sound-power of the epic when performed within enabling events. In these societies, the kaichy, like the shaman, is chosen by spirits and, together with vocal tone (kai), event, words, instrument and music, each has its own ‘master-spirit’. Only by producing kai, enlivening his instrument and uttering the ‘correct’ words can the kaichy travel with his hero to other worlds or ease a dead soul from one dimension to another, and thereby rebalance cosmic and social relations. How do we ensure retention of the sound and performance spirit of oral literature...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the various {{research}} positions with respect {{to the understanding of the}} culture system. The place of culture of the ethnic groups in the modern pluralistic society is determined. The authors disclose the uniqueness of the culture of indigenous peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East through the study of the <b>Khakass</b> visual art. Most of the focus is on the specific visualization of the ethnic theme in the works of <b>Khakass</b> graphic artists and painters. Researching the tendency of artists appealing to the ethnic theme, the authors cover the entire history of the <b>Khakass</b> art development from 1920 s to 2000 s. The article reveals the specific character of the so-called Siberian avant-garde, the contemporary school of <b>Khakass</b> visual art, and its connection with visualization of the ethnic theme in works of various artists. Having found out the tendency of the <b>Khakass</b> artists to appeal to the archaic forms of ethnic culture in their works, the authors suggest a classification of the art works based on the nationally significant values of the <b>Khakass</b> ethnic group, the archaic-material and spiritual culture expressed in the paintings and graphic works. The authors distinguish three most important values of the <b>Khakass</b> (the <b>Khakass</b> religious and mythological world outlook, the value of self-awareness as a representative of the <b>Khakass</b> ethnic group, the world of the ethnos) allowing to systematize the creations of the <b>Khakass</b> artists. Each of these blocks introduces a number of representational paintings and graphic works. Much attention is paid to the analysis of the visual potentials of art works, the artistic form of expressing archaic-material and spiritual traditions of the native population. The cave drawing of the ancient <b>Khakass</b> determined the world outlook of the ethnic group and became the basis for interpreting the content of the works of art. This enabled the researchers to identify the original ideals of the <b>Khakass</b> that could serve as a specific factor in ethnic self-identification in the multicultural system. Статья посвящена рассмотрению различных исследовательских позиций относительно понимания такого феномена, как культура. Определяется место культуры этнических групп в современном плюралистическом обществе. Уникальность культуры коренных малочисленных народов Севера, Сибири и Дальнего Востока раскрывается посредством обращения к исследованию хакасского изобразительного искусства. Главное внимание при этом сосредоточено на специфике визуализации этнической темы в живописных и графических произведениях искусства хакасских мастеров. Исследуя тенденцию обращения художников к этнической теме, авторы охватывают всю историю развития изобразительного искусства в Хакасии с 1920 -х по 2000 -е годы. Раскрывается специфика современного направления хакасского изобразительного искусства «Сибирский авангард», его связь с визуализацией этнической темы в творчестве художников. Обнаружив в основе художественного творчества хакасских художников тенденцию обращения к архаическим формам культуры этноса, авторы предлагают систематизацию произведений искусства с позиции национально-значимых ценностей архаико-материальной и духовной культуры хакасского этноса, выраженных в живописных и графических работах...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBased on the {{analysis}} of the most resistant words (Leipzig–Jakarta list) of Chulym Turkic in comparison with those of the Oghuz and Kipchak languages, authors come to a conclusion that Chulym Turkic is more similar to the Kipchak Turkic languages than the Ohguz ones. The Chulym Turkic material for {{the analysis}} is field dialectological data. The words of other languages under study were taken from dictionaries. The comparative method was used as the main research method. Previously, Chulym Turkic was considered as one of the Siberian Turkic languages also including <b>Khakass,</b> Shor and Saryg-Yughur, to which the authors disagree...|$|E
40|$|The article {{analyzes}} the deformations in {{the mentality of}} the Khakas, a Turkic-speaking ethnos of South Siberia. The authors understand mentality as an internally consistent mode of a people’s existence {{for the sake of}} survival of the ethnos as a whole by means of organizing knowledge into an ethnic worldview; through the creation of a stable hierarchy of ethnically articulated needs, interests and values; through a system of auto- and heterostereotypes; and by developing sustainable forms of behavior in various situations. Due to both external and internal impact, the mentality, a historically stable phenomenon, can suffer deformations. We understand these as a change in the basic elements of the mentality (needs, interests, values) leading to reversible or irreversible transformations for the people. To document the mental deformations among the <b>Khakass,</b> the article compares traditional ethnic values with modern ones. The comparison makes use of two studies of values: an interdisciplinary study of the traditional outlook of the ethnos conducted in mid- 1990 s, an a sociological survey held in 2015. The analysis revealed that the hierarchy of basic traditional values, such as "native land", "Khakass people", "family" preserves its importance for ethnic actors as a resource for the preservation and development of the ethnos even under the conditions of globalization. However, the sociological survey recorded a change in the configuration of the entire value system among the <b>Khakass</b> people. “Family" as a value moves upfront, which follows the general historical pattern: an ethnos in a state of crisis returns to the basic, time-tested social institutions (family, clan). The latter are called upon to preserve the ethnos as a biopsychosocial community...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} crucial crises in the {{development}} of the unique culture of the Khanty and Mansi. The peoples, who had resided the territory of Western Siberia long before Russian settlements were established, were the Tatar, Chulym Turkic, <b>Khakass,</b> Shor, Teleut, Selkup, Nganasan, Enets, Nenets, Kamasin, Ket, Yugh, Kott, Assan, Khanty and Mansi. They had gained valuable and enormous experience of the climate, nature, wild and animal life of their environment. They had a very complex religious system that was closely connected both with the nature and with their life activities. All this – the unique valuable knowledge gained for thousands of years - has been degrading and degenerating. It is being researched due to major reasons of degradation and extinction of unique cultures of the Siberian indigenous peoples. They include: a) collection of the “yasak” and attempts of forced Christianization of indigenous peoples during the Russian Empire times; b) compulsory boarding education in the Soviet times; c) intensive oil and gas exploration in the 20 th century...|$|E
40|$|I. F. : 3. 109 BACKGROUND: The {{incidence}} of gastric cancer (GC) is extremely high in Russia and eastern Siberia, where {{information on the}} epidemiology of Helicobacter pylori infection is fragmentary. AIMS: To assess the prevalence of both H. pylori infection (including CagA status) and intestinal metaplasia (IM) in Russian and eastern Siberian populations carrying a different risk of GC. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  A sample of 2129 consecutive patients was considered, including 689 Europoids and 1440 Mongoloids (493 Evenks, 533 <b>Khakass</b> people, and 414 Tuvans), who all underwent serum sampling and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. H. pylori status was established (ELISA, urease test, and histology), and IgG anti-CagA antibodies were assessed (ELISA) in H. pylori-positive cases. At least 3 biopsy samples per patient were considered, and IM was scored as present versus absent. The prevalence of H. pylori, CagA+ve status, and IM was compared with the {{incidence of}} GC according to the regional cancer registries. RESULTS: The prevalence of H. pylori was similar for the Europoids and Mongoloids (93. 6 vs 94. 3...|$|E

Current {{processes}} {{caused by}} globalization and multiculturalism result in opposing cultural forms {{of a positive}} ethnic identity, related either to hyperidentity or hypoidentity, that depend on the emotional and evaluative attitude of the individual towards his/her ethnic group. This or that cultural form of a positive ethnic identity leads to disharmony of the individual, both with oneself and society in general. The achievement of harmony is possible only if a positive ethnic identity is a norm of inter-ethnic interaction, when members of ethnocultural groups have a positive image of not only their community, but also {{take into account the}} value systems of other groups. This dissertation investigates how it is possible to restore a positive ethnic identity by means of artistic practices, which mechanisms help to construct a positive ethnic identity in the status of a norm {{in the mind of the}} individual and society in general. The dissertation has two sense parts. The first part (chapters 1 – 3) examines the basic theoretical and methodological principles of the construction of an ethnic identity, the conceptual approaches to reveal the nature of ethnicity, explains which of them has a priority and why, describes the main content of a positive ethnic identity, and how the principles of the cultural-semiotic approach are applied to study the constructivist possibilities of artistic practices. The second part (chapters 4 – 5) demonstrates the cultural-semiotic mechanisms of the construction of a positive ethnic identity in art. Using the concepts of worldview, ethnic worldview, artistic worldview and ethnocultural values, the work describes how these mental structures take part in the construction of a positive image of an ethnic community, and how they are related to artistic practices. To reveal cultural-semiotic mechanisms of artistic practices in the process of constructing a positive ethnic identity, it is necessary to address to the <b>Khakass</b> culture. The dissertation highlights not only the certain historic and cultural events that are important for the ethno-cultural group, but also carries out a philosophical and art analysis of fine art paintings and graphic works of the <b>Khakass</b> art as a representative artistic practice of the indigenous peoples of Siberia.

40|$|Results of {{fundamental}} and applied studies of V. N. Sukachev Institute of Forest Russian Academy of Sciences, Siberian Branch and the Research Institute for Agrarian Problems of Khakassia, Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations of Russia in soil deflation control using management, also agrotechnological and agroafforestation measures, {{have been given}} in this scientific review. These activities were undertaken for 55 years. It was established that an average annual humus loss on arable lands {{in the south of}} Central Siberia made 1. 6 t per 1 ha in the result of soil erosion. The system of usage and protection of soils subjected to erosion has been considered which covers the net of forest shelter belts, strip planting of agricultural crops, application of soil protective farming equipment and fertilizing. In the result of complex studies of soils prone to erosion the following activities were worked out: the way for fertility increase of sandy-loam soils by deep application of organic fertilizers; the way for growing the Siberian larch shelter forests; the way for growing the shelter stands using diagonally- wide meshed construction; the way for growing stands on slope pastures; the technology for growing the two-row shelter forests with a wide row- spacing; ways for growing stands for cattle-breeding purpose; ways for growing massive Scots pine stands; principles of choice of trees and bushes for shelter forests; the main standards for evaluation of linear steppe stands in the south of Krasnoyarsk Krai, <b>Khakass</b> Republic and the Republic of Tyva; concept for growing a new generation of shelter forests ect. Protective forest stands established in the south of Central Siberia in the area more than 50 thousand ha are shown to give a new environmental effect resulting in an increase of soil fertility and crop capacity.
