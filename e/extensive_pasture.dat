Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. The perceived decline {{may be due to the}} loss of invertebrate-rich pastures and mixed farms through conversion to arable agriculture or more intensively managed grassland. Adult survival, clutch size and fledging success are all lower in arable landscapes than in areas with <b>extensive</b> <b>pasture.</b> In Finland, the loss of ancient forests is thought to have led to a local decline.|$|E

50|$|Historically the Mineoka Mountain District {{was part}} of Awa Province and the {{southern}} part of Kazusa Province in pre-modern Japan. Numerous shrines and temples were constructed as early as the Nara period, and many of them remain active to this day. Under the Ritsuryō system of Nara-period Japan it is thought the area was used for <b>extensive</b> <b>pasture</b> land for horses. During the Sengoku period these small-scale ranches were revived by the Satomi clan, a powerful clan based in Awa Province.|$|E
30|$|<b>Extensive</b> <b>pastures</b> have {{traditionally}} {{played an important}} role in the evolution of human societies and the land on which they were living, particularly in the Mediterranean areas (Jouven et al. 2010). <b>Extensive</b> <b>pastures</b> still function today in the production of a range of quality foods (Boyazoglu and Morand-Fehr 2001) and in providing a spectrum of environmental services. Grazing livestock exert a strong impact on the vegetation not only in forage quantity and quality (Bailey et al. 1998), but also on vegetation dynamics (Casasús et al. 2005; Kramer et al. 2003), species and community diversity (Olff and Ritchie 1998; Collins et al. 1998; Sternberg et al. 2000) and, finally, the landscape (Adler et al. 2001; Perevolotsky 2005). Overall, grazing activity significantly contributes to a particularly rich mosaic of vegetation (Balent and Gibon 1996) and results in the creation and preservation of all dimensions of biodiversity (Rook et al. 2004; Clergue et al. 2005; Dover et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|Brazilian {{beef cattle}} {{production}} is primarily based in grazing systems which in general present low productivity {{as a result}} of <b>extensive</b> monoculture <b>pastures.</b> Integrated systems come up as alternatives to overcome this scenario which in turn may have impacts on agricultural greenhouse gas emission. In 2015, we reported the first results on enteric methane (CH 4) emissions comparing extensive and integrated systems (Gomes et al., 2015). However, it is important to observe how results behave over time, in order to draw robust conclusions. The aim was to evaluate the enteric methane emission of beef cattle grazing <b>extensive</b> <b>pastures</b> (EXT), integrated crop-livestock (ICL) and crop-livestock-forest systems (ICLF) in two seasons, over a two-year study. 201...|$|R

5000|$|The {{community}} of Puerto Arista {{is located in}} the municipality of Tonalá, twenty two km from the municipal seat and sixteen km off Federal Highway 200. The area is part of the Istmo-Costa region of the state, itself part of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. This coast area is a strip of land wedged between the Sierra Madre de Chiapas mountains and the Pacific Ocean [...] This area is mostly filled with small towns and ranches with <b>extensive</b> <b>pasture</b> for cattle, the main economic activity for this region. Some of the nearby communities include Cabeza de Toro, which straddles the road linking Puerta Arista and Boca del Cielo, both on the La Joya Lagoon.|$|E
50|$|Ninety-five {{per cent}} of the region is uncleared. The major {{industries}} are mining and <b>extensive</b> <b>pasturing.</b> During good seasons in the 1870s and 1880s, large sheep stations were established with high stocking rates, partly {{in response to a}} widespread belief that the introduction of European agriculture would cause climate change in favour of European conditions. This 'Rain follows the plow' myth was shattered by the droughts of the 1890s, and many of the stations established during this period were subsequently abandoned.|$|R
5000|$|The {{natural region}} is drained {{to the east}} by the Thulba and Aschach into the Franconian Saale. No {{noteworthy}} streams flow into the Sinn. In 1968, {{at the time of}} the publication of Sheet 140 [...] "Schweinfurt", the annual precipitation was 1000-1100 mm, on 90-110 days of the year there was a continuous layer of snow. In addition, <b>extensive</b> <b>pastures</b> characterised the area and there were deciduous woods on the mountainsides. Since then, over half the area has become colonised by coniferous forest.|$|R
50|$|In 1898, {{a railway}} was built from Fremantle to Robb Jetty. At that time, an {{abattoir}} {{was built for}} slaughter of livestock arriving from the north-west of the state including the Kimberley Region. Livestock were unloaded from the ships onto a jetty. <b>Extensive</b> <b>pasturing</b> for the animals as well as small market gardens were established in the region around the abattoir.The Coogee Hotel was built in 1901, and in 1903 the railway was extended to Woodman Point. Commercial lime kilns were established during this period {{to provide for the}} construction boom and population growth which had been brought about by gold discoveries.|$|R
50|$|After the conquest, William I {{bestowed}} several gifts on the Benedictine abbey of Abbey of Saint-Florent de Saumur, {{including the}} church of Andover, with a hide and 14 acre of land, tithes of all the demesne lands in the parish, and <b>extensive</b> <b>pasture</b> rights, with wood for fuel, for fencing and for building purposes. The gift was renewed by William Rufus in 1100, he also directed that all churches built under the mother church of Andover should either be utterly destroyed or held by the monks of St. Florent. The abbey establishing the priory with a colony of monks soon after the church was given to them. The homes of the monks are described as being juxta ecclesiam (beside the church).|$|E
50|$|On the Eisbach grasslands near Heppenheim a king encamped {{with his}} army twice during the 13th century. In August 1250, King Conrad IV made his {{quarters}} {{for six days}} here following the battle against William of Holland. About fifty years later during the dispute over the throne between King Adolphus of Nassau and Duke Albert of Austria the decisive Battle of Göllheim took place. Immediately before the battle King Adolphus camped for several days from 1 July 1298 with his cavalry army near Heppenheim and Wiesoppenheim. Dort fand er für seine Streitmacht, die auf etwa 5.000 Mann - vorwiegend Reiter - geschätzt wird, on the fields by the Eisbach where there was <b>extensive</b> <b>pasture.</b> The Wimpfen Chronicle mentions explicitly the lush meadoes near Heppenheim. After King Adolphus had falle in the Battle of Göllheim on 2 July 1298, his victor, Albert of Austria, refused to let him be buried in Speyer Cathedral. So Adolphus' body was initially interred in the Cistercian convent of Rosenthal, which lay left of the Eisbach on its tributary, the Rodenbach. Not until 1309 was his coffin transferred to Speyer. In the cathedral Aldolphus was laid next to his former rival, Albert, who had been murdered in 1308 by his own nephew.|$|E
30|$|Low OCs {{areas are}} often either {{located in the}} steep slope areas of the upper {{watershed}} or in the valleys, where <b>extensive</b> <b>pasture</b> areas dominate. However, these areas are {{also found in the}} lower parts of the watershed, where a small-scale settlement promoting family-oriented cattle ranching was launched a decade ago by the government of Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
30|$|The {{estimated}} OCs {{of converting}} land use/land cover {{to the benefit}} of water quality can range between 4, 000 to 5, 000 BRL per hectare each year for agricultural systems and less than 100 BRL for pasture land. However, the actual OCs per hectare in many sub-watersheds are likely to be much lower, especially if land close to rivers and headwaters is covered by <b>extensive</b> <b>pastures.</b> On the demand side, we estimate that the water company CEDAE's maximum WTP for land use change in the watershed based on avoided costs is 15, 510 BRL per additional 1 % reduction in turbidity levels at the water intake point of the water utility.|$|R
50|$|A Ländchen is the German name {{given to}} several Ice Age plateaux in the Havelland region, which climb to over 70 metres above the {{formerly}} marshy urstromtal levels (old glacial meltwater valleys) of the Havelland Luch and the Rhinluch. The {{difference between these}} Ländchen and the surrounding countryside is even more marked because of the different land uses {{to which they are}} put. <b>Extensive</b> <b>pastures</b> in the lowlands contrast with the arable fields and woods on the low hills. Geologically they are largely complete formations of ground moraine from the Saale and Weichselian glaciations that, in places, are covered by gently rolling end moraines.|$|R
30|$|Animal {{products}} {{were very much}} in demand at Constantinople, the Empire's capital, where the most prominent supply areas were Paphlagonia (at the north of Asia Minor) and the Balkans (Leontsini 2008). However, nomadism, the semi-nomadic system and the household farming of sheep and goats in the Balkans alternated in accordance to political conditions. On one hand, political unification under the Empire enabled the movement of herds and products, {{but on the other}} hand, barbarian raids and imperial wars depleted the countryside's people and other resources. The nomadic system centred mainly on the <b>extensive</b> <b>pastures</b> of the large landowners, while semi-nomadic and settled crop farming thrived during war periods when long distance transport was difficult (Laiou and Morrisson 2003).|$|R
40|$|The {{project is}} a study of soil erosion within the cairnfields on the Eastern Moors of Derbyshire. A range of Archaeological {{features}} and natural sedimentary sequences were excavated {{in the search for}} eroded sediments. The erosion evident at these features was dated by means of radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence dating. Contrary to previous assumptions as to the scale of erosion in later prehistory, which maintain that this was a severe problem, it is concluded that the evidence indicates a low degree of erosion for the Bronze Age. Erosion is concluded to have increased from the Iron Age with the establishment of <b>extensive</b> <b>pasture</b> land...|$|E
40|$|The Rhodes {{research}} {{farm with}} its large topographic variability and <b>extensive</b> <b>pasture</b> acreage {{is an ideal}} site to evaluate the application of precision agriculture technologies to forage production and management. In previous studies at Rhodes {{it has been shown}} that forage legumes are adapted to sites with higher slopes (15 - 20 %), and increasing species diversity with legumes at these sites improves productivity and forage quality. In the current study we are using global positioning systems (GPS) and geographic information systems (GIS) technologies to describe and map the spatial variability in pasture vegetation and examine its relationship to maps generated for slope, drainage, and electrical conductivity. Our objective is to determine whether these technologies can be used successfully to predict grass and legume distribution within the pastures based on topography and soil properties...|$|E
40|$|Small natural sights in {{agricultural}} landscapes {{are threatened by}} a number of factors. To protect them you need to identify negative factors that influence them. Natural Monument Hill in the cadastral Bindings Vyškova is used as <b>extensive</b> <b>pasture</b> protected because of rare species of thermophilic plants. The area measurements were taken basal soil respiration, soil organic matter content in the soil by burning a number of moving forms of nitrogen in the soil. Contamination of the nitrogen from external sources has not been established, there have been differences in the content of organic matter in the soil, caused by the truth, like the management of the territory. Measurement of basal respiration showed dependency on the content of water in the soil during the vegetation period. The result of survey sites and outputs from laboratory measurements should be advised to head better care settings management of protected areas and improve its condition...|$|E

40|$|The European Water Framework Directive {{requires}} that all surface waters and groundwater within defined river basin districts must reach at least ‘good’ status by 2015. Thus, the directive requires {{the development of}} management strategies to restore rivers and lakes to “good” status within a specified timeframe. Simulation models are essential tools to evaluate potential consequences of proposed strategies and to facilitate management decisions. One {{of the most commonly}} used river basin model is ArcSWAT, a combination of the simulation model SWAT with a GIS user interface. To test the application of ArcSWAT under German conditions, a relatively small watershed (52 km²) with sufficient data on soils, land use, climate, water flow and river water quality was selected. The watershed shows a wide variety of land use (intensive farm land, <b>extensive</b> <b>pasture,</b> and forest), soils (light sandy soils and heavy loams), surface slopes (flat to 30...|$|E
40|$|Dung beetle populations, in decline, play a {{critical}} ecological role in <b>extensive</b> <b>pasture</b> ecosystems by recycling organic matter; thus {{the importance of their}} conservation status. Presence data available for Copris hispanus (L.) and Copris lunaris (L.) (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae) in Comunidad de Madrid (CM), and BIOMAPPER, a GIS-based tool, was used to model their environmental niches. The so derived potential distributions of both species were used to exemplify the utility of this kind of methodologies in conservation assessment, as well as its capacity to describe the potential sympatry between two or more species. Both species, distributed along a Dry-Mediterranean to Wet-Alpine environmental conditions gradient, overlap in areas of moderate temperatures and mean annual precipitations in the north of CM. Copris are poorly conserved in the existing protected sites network, but protection provided by new sites included in the future Natura 2000 Network will improve the general conservation status of these species in CM...|$|E
40|$|In a {{proof-of-concept}} study, Britton et al. (2008) {{demonstrated that}} the isotopic composition of halophytic plants can be traced in the skeletal tissues of their animal consumers. Here we apply the method to domestic herbivore remains (n = 303) from nine archaeological sites {{in or near the}} Flemish coastal plain (Belgium), where, prior to embankments, salt-marshes offered <b>extensive</b> <b>pasture</b> grounds for domestic herbivores. The sites span a period of ∼ 1500 years (Roman to late medieval period), during which the coastal landscape was progressively transformed from little managed wetlands to a fully embanked polder area. The bulk collagen data show variations between sites and over time, which are consistent with this historical framework and are interpreted as reflecting environmental change and differences in animal management in the coastal plain throughout the late Holocene. The study demonstrates the immense value of faunal stable isotope analysis for characterising coastal husbandry strategies beyond the means of traditional zooarchaeological techniques...|$|E
50|$|The San Miguel Province {{is one of}} the {{thirteen}} provinces in the Cajamarca Region of Peru. It was created by Law No. 15152 on September 29, 1964 by president Fernando Belaunde Terry. It has a mountainous territory which varies in height from 500 to more than 4,000 metres (1,600-13,000 ft) above sea level. As a result, there is a great diversity of climates ranging from hot and dry at lower altitudes to cold and rainy at higher levels. Herding is an important economic activity thanks to the existence of <b>extensive</b> <b>pastures.</b> Its main product is cow's milk which is either sold outside the province or transformed into dairy products such as cheese. There are several gold mines in production in the higher regions of the province. There's also an important handicraft industry mainly devoted to textiles made out of cotton or wool.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a wide}} {{distribution}} of mammals such as field voles, foxes and badgers {{as well as many}} songbirds.
