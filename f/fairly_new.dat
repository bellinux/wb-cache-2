5|$|B.epica is <b>fairly</b> <b>new</b> to cultivation. Kevin Collins of the Banksia Farm in Albany, Western Australia {{is said to}} have pioneered its cultivation, growing it in {{loamy clay}} or sandy gravel. It showed good {{tolerance}} for alkaline soils in those conditions, and has also succeeded in sandy, alkaline soil near the coast between Mandurah and Kwinana. The Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra has also had some success in cultivating the species. Seeds were sown in February 1996, and planted out in November 1997; seedlings planted into sections without good drainage died, but two seedlings that were planted into a section with excellent drainage were about a metre tall by 2002, and flowering prolifically.|$|E

50|$|Two <b>fairly</b> <b>newer</b> {{neighborhood}}s, {{located along}} Sandbloom Road, south of Algonquin Road, are Riverwood and Algonquin Lakes. Riverwood {{was built in}} the 1980s and 1990s, while Algonquin Lakes {{was built in the}} early 2000s. Both include single-family homes and townhomes. Located within Algonquin Lakes is Algonquin Lakes Elementary, Algonquin Lakes Park, and a series of trails and lakes. This neighborhood abuts Jewel-Osco and Walgreens. Glenloch, an age 55+ age-restricted community consisting of single-family and multi-family homes, is pending development, just east of Algonquin Lakes along the south side of Algonquin Road.|$|R

5|$|Preface to Plato had a {{profound}} impact almost immediately after publication, but an impact that was complex and inconsistent. The book's claims refer to the ideas of a number of different fields: the study (then <b>fairly</b> <b>new)</b> of oral literature as well as Greek philosophy and Greek philology; the book also acknowledges the influence of literary theory, particularly structuralism. The 1960s were a period in which those fields were growing further apart, and the reaction to Preface from each of them was starkly different. Among classicists the response ranged from indifference to derision, with the majority simply questioning the details of Havelock's history of literacy, pointing both to earlier instances of writing than Havelock thinks possible or to later instances of oral influence. Philosophy, particularly Platonic scholarship, was moving in a different direction at the time, and Havelock neither engages nor was cited by the principal movers in that field. However, the book was embraced by literary theorists, students of the transition to literacy, and others in fields as diverse as psychology and anthropology.|$|E
5|$|The 1926 Lithuanian coup d'état (Lithuanian: 1926-ųjų perversmas) was a {{military}} coup d'état in Lithuania {{that resulted in the}} replacement of the democratically elected government with a conservative authoritarian government led by Antanas Smetona. The coup took place on 17 December 1926 and was largely organized by the military; Smetona's role remains the subject of debate. The coup brought the Lithuanian Nationalist Union, the most conservative party at the time, to power. Before 1926, it had been a <b>fairly</b> <b>new</b> and insignificant nationalistic party: in 1926, its membership numbered about 2,000 and it had won only three seats in the parliamentary elections. The Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, the largest party in the Seimas at the time, collaborated with the military and provided constitutional legitimacy to the coup, but did not accept any major posts in the new government and withdrew in May 1927. After the military handed power over to the civilian government, it ceased playing a direct role in political life.|$|E
5|$|Development of the PlayStation Vita port began {{shortly before}} the start of the game's service in 2014. The team formed a {{partnership}} with Sony to develop the title, but production ran into difficulties as the team attempted to create an experience of the same quality as the mobile version, along with adjusting the controls from touch-based to the button and joystick controls of the Vita. There was also some resistance from staff surrounding the usage of the Mana franchise and Oyamada's determination to bring Rise of Mana to consoles in the face of suggestions that it would be better to make a completely new game. When the project was proposed to Sony, the Unity technology built into the Vita was <b>fairly</b> <b>new</b> and did not make full use of the platform's processing power. In addition, the staff were unused to the version of Unity for the Vita. The team needed cooperation from both Sony and Unity Technologies to optimize the engine so the game could run on the new platform. By the time of the Vita version's announcement, only the preliminary development work had been completed, but development was proceeding according to plan. Technical troubles related to the game's performance persisted beyond this point, resulting in the release being delayed into the following year.|$|E
