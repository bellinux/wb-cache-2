5|$|Buxton was {{developed}} by the Dukes of Devonshire as a genteel <b>health</b> <b>resort</b> in the 18th century. It has an opera house and theatre, museum and art gallery. Poole's Cavern is a show cave. The spa at Matlock Bath was popularised in the Victorian era. The village also contains the show caves and mines of the Heights of Abraham which can be reached by cable car.|$|E
5|$|Runcorn was a small, {{isolated}} village {{until the}} Industrial Revolution. It was a <b>health</b> <b>resort</b> {{in the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries. Towards {{the end of the}} 18th century, a port began to develop on the south bank of the River Mersey. During the 19th century, industries developed the manufacture of soap and alkali, quarrying, shipbuilding, engineering, and tanning. In the early 20th century, the prime industries were chemicals and tanning. The original village has grown to include what were outlying villages.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating {{that people}} {{would come to the}} area to indulge in the newly fashionable pastime of sea-bathing, an {{activity}} with perceived health benefits, Tregonwell built a series of villas on his land between 1816 and 1822, which he hoped to let out. The common belief that pine-scented air was good for lung conditions, and in particular tuberculosis, prompted Tregonwell and Tapps to plant hundreds of pine trees. These early attempts to promote the town as a <b>health</b> <b>resort</b> meant that by the time Tregonwell had died in 1832, Bournemouth had grown into a small community with a scattering of houses, villas and cottages. The town would ultimately grow up around the scattered pines and tree-lined walk to the beach, later to become known as the Invalids' Walk.|$|E
40|$|The {{elderly people}} {{account for about}} 30 per cent of all {{patients}} treated in Polish <b>health</b> <b>resorts.</b> On the basis of studies conducted {{in a sample of}} six <b>health</b> <b>resorts</b> the author makes an attempt at estimation of frequency with which the elderly people benefit from health-resort services. It appeared that most men and women visiting <b>health</b> <b>resorts</b> were between 50 and 54 years of age. The elderly people were visiting <b>health</b> <b>resorts</b> much more frequently than younger people. Men over 60 years of age benefit from the health services in these resorts twice as of ten as the national average while women’s share is by 40 per cent higher than the national average. Older men tend to visit <b>health</b> <b>resorts</b> more frequent y than women and the difference in frequency of visits grows along with age: frequency of visits in <b>health</b> <b>resorts</b> decreases in the case of people over sixty years of age, and it abruptly declines for people over 70 years of age.

5|$|Before it {{was founded}} in 1810 by Lewis Tregonwell, the area was a deserted {{heathland}} occasionally visited by fishermen and smugglers. Initially marketed as a <b>health</b> <b>resort,</b> the town received a boost when it appeared in Augustus Granville's 1841 book, The Spas of England. Bournemouth's growth truly accelerated {{with the arrival of the}} railway and it became a recognised town in 1870. Historically part of Hampshire, it joined Dorset with the reorganisation of local government in 1974. Since 1997, the town has been administered by a unitary authority, meaning it is independent of Dorset County Council, although it remains part of that ceremonial county. The local council is Bournemouth Borough Council.|$|E
5|$|During the British Raj, Darjeeling's {{temperate}} climate {{led to its}} development as a hill station for British residents seeking to escape the summer heat of the plains. The development of Darjeeling as a sanatorium and <b>health</b> <b>resort</b> proceeded briskly. Arthur Campbell, a surgeon with the Company, and Lieutenant Robert Napier were responsible for establishing a hill station there. Campbell's efforts to develop the station, attract immigrants to cultivate the slopes and stimulate trade resulted in a hundredfold increase in the population of Darjeeling between 1835 and 1849. The first road connecting the town with the plains was constructed between 1839 and 1842. In 1848, a military depot was set up for British soldiers, and the town became a municipality in 1850. Commercial cultivation of tea in the district began in 1856, and induced a number of British planters to settle there. Darjeeling became the formal summer capital of the Bengal Presidency after 1864. Scottish missionaries undertook the construction of schools and welfare centres for the British residents, laying the foundation for Darjeeling's notability as a centre of education. The opening of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway in 1881 further hastened {{the development of the}} region. In 1899, Darjeeling was rocked by major landslides that caused severe damage to the town and the native population.|$|E
