5|$|The fight {{continued}} into the evening, and after dark the 1st Battalion <b>disengaged</b> and withdrew through the 2nd Battalion immediately behind it. Both Check and the regimental commander, Michaelis, expected the North Koreans to encircle the 1st Battalion position during the night if it stayed where it was.|$|E
5|$|During the {{exchange}} of gunfire, Farenholt received several damaging hits from both the Japanese and American ships, killing several men. She escaped from the crossfire by crossing ahead of San Francisco and passing to the <b>disengaged</b> side of Scott's column. Duncan—still engaged in her solitary torpedo attack on the Japanese formation—was also hit by gunfire from both sides, set afire, and looped away in her own effort to escape the crossfire.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{solutions}} that would mechanically simultaneously release both falls were proposed. The British Royal Navy adopted and standardized on the Robinson's <b>Disengaging</b> Gear in 1881, and this system {{was still in}} use in the late 20th century.The Robinson's <b>Disengaging</b> Gear consists of three mechanisms. There are two <b>disengaging</b> hooks, one {{at each end of}} the seaboat, holding the boat to the falls. The two <b>disengaging</b> hooks are connected by a relatively tight and thin wire rope to the <b>disengaging</b> release clip located approximately at the center of the seaboat. The thin connecting wire rope is called the [...] "Fore and After". The <b>disengaging</b> hooks are normally held safe from unintentionally dropping the seaboat by a pin in each <b>disengaging</b> hook.|$|R
50|$|Much like Klayton's {{experiences}} with R.E.X., his short deal with Flying Tart provided {{a number of}} frustrations. Although Klayton intended to release <b>Disengage</b> in 1997 and precede its release with an EP of <b>Disengage</b> remixes titled Refractorchasm, Flying Tart canceled the EP's release and delayed <b>Disengage</b> until 1998, requiring Klayton to tack the EP onto <b>Disengage</b> {{in order to ensure}} the release of the music. The label also reduced the length of the album's art booklet, which Klayton self-designed. Within two weeks of signing his contract with Flying Tart, the label was bought out and dissolved, ensuring the album saw extremely limited distribution.|$|R
40|$|Visuospatial neglect after stroke {{is often}} {{characterized}} by a <b>disengage</b> deficit on a cued orienting task, in which individuals are disproportionately slower to respond to targets presented on the contralesional side of space following an ispilesional cue {{as compared to the}} reverse. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the generality of the finding of a <b>disengage</b> deficit on another measure of cued attention, the temporal order judgment (TOJ) task, that does not depend upon speeded manual responses. Individuals with right hemisphere stroke with and without spatial neglect and older healthy controls were tested with both a speeded RT cueing task and an unspeeded TOJ-with-cuing task. All stroke patients evidenced a <b>disengage</b> deficit on the speeded RT cueing task, although the size and direction of the bias was not associated with the severity of neglect. In contrast, few neglect patients showed a <b>disengage</b> deficit on the TOJ task. This discrepancy suggests that the <b>disengage</b> deficit may be related to task demands, rather than solely due to impaired attentional mechanisms per se. Further, the results of our study show that the <b>disengage</b> deficit is neither necessary nor sufficient for neglect to manifest...|$|R
5|$|Following {{the flight}} of their monarch, the Pergamese fleet withdrew north. However, having been bested by the Rhodians on the allied right wing, the Macedonian left wing <b>disengaged</b> and retreated to join its victorious right flank.

5|$|The pilots felt a jolt, and the {{autopilot}} <b>disengaged.</b> As Records {{took hold of}} his control column, Haynes focused on the tail engine, whose instruments indicated it was malfunctioning; he found its throttle and fuel supply controls jammed. At Dvorak's suggestion, a valve cutting fuel to the tail engine was shut off. This part of the emergency took 14 seconds.|$|E
5|$|After Re d'Italia sank, the Italian fleet {{began to}} disengage, with the badly burning Palestro {{trailing}} behind, {{soon to be}} destroyed by a magazine explosion. Persano broke off the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, he refused to counter-attack with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance {{so as not to}} risk his success. As night began to fall, the opposing fleets <b>disengaged</b> completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively.|$|E

5|$|After {{the battle}} ended, while Stark's militiamen were busy disarming the prisoners and looting their supplies, Breymann arrived with his reinforcements. Seeing the Americans in disarray, they {{immediately}} pressed their attack. After hastily regrouping, Stark's forces {{tried to hold}} their ground against the new German onslaught, but began to fall back. Before their lines collapsed, Warner's men {{arrived on the scene}} to reinforce Stark's troops. Pitched battle continued until dark, when both sides <b>disengaged.</b> Breymann began a hasty retreat; he had lost one quarter of his force and all of his artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|Although the British {{ships were}} {{substantially}} larger than any individual French vessel, the frigates were more numerous and more manoeuvrable. Neither side {{could afford to}} take significant damage in the battle, so each sought to drive the other off rather than achieve an outright victory. On 9 September Sercey's frigates formed a line of battle, successfully engaging first Arrogant and then Victorious and inflicting damage on each while preventing them from supporting one another. The French frigates, particularly Vertu and Seine, also suffered and by late morning both sides <b>disengaged,</b> the British retiring to Madras for repairs while Sercey anchored at King's Island in the Mergui Archipelago, eventually sheltering in Batavia.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, Persano {{broke off}} the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, {{he refused to}} {{counter-attack}} with his badly demoralized forces.

As night began to fall, the opposing fleets <b>disengaged</b> completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively. Kaiser Max had emerged from the battle essentially undamaged, the Italian shells having been unable to penetrate her armor.|$|E

Between 29 February and 1 March 1992, a referendum on independence of Bosnia and Herzegovinawhich would later be cited as a pretext for the Bosnian Warwas held. Bosnian Serbs set up barricades in the capital Sarajevo and elsewhere on 1 March, and the next day the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj. In the final days of March, the Bosnian Serb army started shelling Bosanski Brod, and Sarajevo was attacked on 4 April.|$|E
5|$|By 1971, both Egypt and Saudi Arabia had <b>disengaged</b> from Yemen. South Yemen {{formed a}} {{connection}} with the Soviet Union. In September 1971, Amri resigned after murdering a photographer in San'a, and more power was given to Iryani, the effective President. By then, the royalists were integrated into the new republic, except for al-Badr's family, and a consultative Council was established. Clashes along {{the border between the}} states rose, and in 1972 a small war broke.|$|E
5|$|By now Nir had <b>disengaged</b> at El-Qantarah, {{leaving a}} {{battalion}} behind, and arrived opposite the Firdan bridge at 12:30 with two tank battalions. While Amir and Nir discussed {{plans for an}} attack, Keren arrived and Adan ordered him to support Nir and Amir by attacking towards Purkan. Meanwhile, Sharon left Tasa and headed for Suez City, leaving a single reconnaissance company to hold vital ridges such as Hamadia and Kishuf, but not the hills to the north, such as Hamutal. Instead, Keren's brigade gained responsibility for these areas, but Sharon's action further endangered Adan's position.|$|E

5|$|Heavy rains fell {{during the}} night of September 5/6 and mud slowed all wheeled and tracked {{vehicles}} in the withdrawal. The 2nd Battalion <b>disengaged</b> from the North Korean and began its withdrawal at 03:00 on September 6. The North Koreans quickly discovered that the 2nd Battalion was withdrawing and attacked it. In the vicinity of Hills 464 and 380 the battalion discovered at daybreak that it was virtually surrounded by North Koreans. Moving by itself and completely cut off from all other units, G Company, numbering only about 80 men, was hardest hit.|$|E

5|$|The {{effect of}} Rupert's actions, {{even after his}} forces <b>disengaged,</b> was to force another delay in the Parliamentarian retreat; Essex spent much of 19 September looking after wounded {{soldiers}} and, when he finally managed to begin moving again, he was confronted with swampland and bog which further delayed him while the Royalists marched across the relatively open chalk downs above the Kennet. These hardships meant that the Royalists arrived at Newbury before Essex, with both armies settling down for the night outside the town, too exhausted to immediately fight.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{hypothesized}} that whereas Japanese culture encourages socially engaging emotions (e. g., friendly feelings and guilt), North American culture fosters socially <b>disengaging</b> emotions (e. g., pride and anger). In two cross-cultural studies, {{the authors measured}} engaging and <b>disengaging</b> emotions repeatedly over different social situations and found support for this hypothesis. As predicted, Japanese showed a pervasive tendency to reportedly experience engaging emotions more strongly than they experienced <b>disengaging</b> emotions, but Americans showed a reversed tendency. Moreover, as also predicted, Japanese subjective well-being (i. e., the experience of general positive feelings) was more {{closely associated with the}} experience of engaging positive emotions than with that of <b>disengaging</b> emotions. Americans tended to show the reversed pattern. The established cultural differences in the patterns of emotion suggest the consistent and systematic cultural shaping of emotion over time.
