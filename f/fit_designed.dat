40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} two data-based {{models for}} the measured time series of global annual average tropospheric temperatures. One model is a smoothing spline <b>fit</b> <b>designed</b> to give an optimal separation of signal from noise. The other combines an optimal spline fit to the measured record of CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere with a previously reported 70 year cycle in the temperatures. It assumes a simple linear relation between changes in temperature {{and changes in the}} CO 2 concentration. When the cycle is added to the model, its fit to the temperature data is very similar to the optimal spline fit. The differences between the two fits are smaller in magnitude than the residuals for either one of them...|$|E

40|$|Textbooks on {{response}} surface methodology {{emphasize the importance}} of lack-of-fit tests when fitting {{response surface}} models, and stress that, to be able to test for lack of <b>fit,</b> <b>designed</b> experiments should have replication and allow for pure-error estimation. In this paper, we show how to obtain pure-error estimates and how to carry out a lack-of-fit test when the experiment is not completely randomized, but a blocked experiment, a split-plot experiment, or any other multi-stratum experiment. Our approach to calculating pure-error estimates is based on residual maximum likelihood (REML) estimation of the variance components in a full treatment model. It generalizes the one suggested by Vining et al. (2005) {{in the sense that it}} works for a broader set of designs and for replicates other than center point replicates. Our lackof-fit test also generalizes the test proposed by Khuri (1992) for data from blocked experiments because it exploits replicates other than center point replicates and works for split-plot and other multi-stratum designs as well. We provide analytical expressions for the test statistic and the corresponding degrees of freedom, and demonstrate how to perform the lack-of-fit test in the SAS procedure MIXED. We re-analyze several published data sets and discover a few instances in which the usual response surface model exhibits significant lack of fit...|$|E

40|$|This paper derives {{efficient}} pricing formulae {{for renewable}} energy Feed-in Tariff (<b>FiT)</b> <b>designs</b> that incorporate exposure to uncertain market prices by using option pricing theory. Such <b>FiT</b> <b>designs</b> are presented {{as a means to}} delineate market price risk amongst investors and policymakers when designing renewable energy support schemes. Sequential game theory provides the theoretical framework through which we model the strategic interaction of policymakers and investors during policy formulation. This model is solved using option pricing theory when a FiT is comprised of market prices combined with a guaranteed element. This solution also allows for an analytical formulation of the policy cost of subsidisation. Partial derivatives characterise sensitivity of policy cost and investor remuneration to deviations in market conditions beyond those expected. Analytical derivations provide a set of tools which may guide more efficient FiT policy and investment decisions. Numerical simulations demonstrate application for a stylised Irish case study, with a scenario analysis providing further insight into the relative sensitivity of policy cost and investor remuneration under different market conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|Linear {{regression}} models {{are among the}} models most used in practice, although the practitioners are often not sure whether their assumed linear regression model is at least approximately true. In such situations, only designs for which the linear model can be checked are accepted in practice. For important linear {{regression models}} such as polynomial regression, optimal designs do not have this property. To get practically attractive designs, we suggest the following strategy. One part of the design points is used to allow one {{to carry out a}} lack of fit test with good power for practically interesting alternatives. The rest of the design points are determined {{in such a way that}} the whole design is optimal for inference on the unknown parameter in case the lack of fit test does not reject the linear regression model. To solve this problem, we introduce efficient lack of <b>fit</b> <b>designs.</b> Then we explicitly determine the e_k-optimal design in the class of efficient lack of <b>fit</b> <b>designs</b> for polynomial regression of degree k- 1.

40|$|Top-down energy-economic {{modeling}} approaches {{often use}} deliberately simple techniques to represent heterogeneous resource inputs to production. We show {{that for some}} policies, such as feed-in tariffs (FIT) for renewable electricity, detailed representation of renewable resource grades is required to describe the technology more precisely and identify cost-effective policy designs. We extend a hybrid approach for modeling heterogeneity {{in the quality of}} natural resource inputs required for renewable energy production in a stylized computable general equilibrium (CGE) framework. Importantly, this approach resolves nearflat or near-vertical sections of the resource supply curve that translate into key features of the marginal cost of wind resource supply, allowing for more realistic policy simulation. In a second step, we represent the shape of a resource supply curve based on more detailed data. We show that for the case of onshore wind development in China, a differentiated <b>FIT</b> <b>design</b> that can only be modeled with the hybrid approach requires {{less than half of the}} subsidy budget needed for a uniform <b>FIT</b> <b>design</b> and proves to be more cost-effective.
