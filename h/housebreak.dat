25|$|The Shiba is a {{relatively}} fastidious breed and feels {{the need to maintain}} itself in a clean state. They can often be seen licking their paws and legs, much like a cat. They generally {{go out of their way}} to keep their coats clean. Because of their fastidious and proud nature, Shiba puppies are easy to <b>housebreak</b> and in many cases will <b>housebreak</b> themselves. Having their owner simply place them outside after meal times and naps is generally enough to teach the Shiba the appropriate method of toileting.|$|E

They do need {{plenty of room to}} exercise. They will not be happy confined to kennel life; they want to enjoy their family. They crave attention and physical contact. Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are bold, faithful and willing workers and are [...] eager to please. The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is confident in nature; the breed is gentle with children. They can be stubborn and determined. The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is an intelligent breed and is a quick learner.

5000|$|Magyar agárs {{are very}} {{adaptable}} and can live comfortably in apartments {{as well as}} outdoor kennels {{as long as they}} are provided with adequate exercise and human interaction. If kept inside, they are very easy to <b>housebreak</b> and make wonderful house pets. During the day they will spend a good portion of their time sleeping, but they are by no means [...] "couch potatoes" [...] and do require daily exercise to stay fit and happy. Long walks, free running and trotting next to a bicycle are the best ways to exercise Magyars since they are not usually too keen on ball-chasing as are other breeds.|$|E
5000|$|Rabbits are {{increasingly}} kept as house pets in family homes, in [...] "rabbit-proofed" [...] spaces {{that do not}} provide dangerous or valuable things upon which to gnaw. Living indoors shelters a rabbit from outdoor dangers such as predators, weather, vehicles, and pesticides, and thus lengthens their lifespan. Rabbits are easy to <b>housebreak,</b> by training them to use a cat-style litter box, with low-dust litter or other materials that will not cause health problems if ingested. Those that are not spayed or neutered may begin to engage in territorial marking (which can frustrate efforts to litter-train as well as damage household items) and aggressive behavior.|$|E
50|$|Affenpinschers have a {{distinct}} appearance that some associate with terriers. They {{are different from}} terriers, however, {{in that they are}} actually part of the pinscher-schnauzer of group 2 in the FCI classification and so often get along with other dogs and pets. They are active, adventurous, curious, and stubborn, but they are also fun-loving and playful. The breed is confident, lively, affectionate towards family members and is also very protective of them. This loyal little dog enjoys being with its family. It needs consistent, firm training since some can be quite difficult to <b>housebreak.</b> This type of dog easily becomes bored, so training should be varied. The affenpinscher has a terrier-like personality.|$|E

Likewise the social, political, economical, and religious preferences of the negro remain close to the caterpillar and the cockroach. This is not stated to ridicule or abuse the negro. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the caterpillar or the cockroach. It is merely a matter of taste. A cockroach or caterpillar remains proper food for a chimpanzee." ...|$|E
50|$|MIT {{doctoral}} student Tong Wang, Cambridge (Mass.) Police Department CPD Lieutenant Daniel Wagner, CPD crime analyst Rich Sevieri and Assoc. Prof. of Statistics at MIT Sloan School of Management and {{the co-author of}} Learning to Detect Patterns of Crime Cynthia Rudin have designed a machine learning method called “Series Finder” that can assist police in discovering crime series in {{a fraction of the}} time. Series Finder grows a pattern of crime, starting from a seed of two or more crimes. The Cambridge Police Department has one of the oldest crime analysis units in the world and their historical data was used to train Series Finder to detect <b>housebreak</b> patterns. The algorithm tries to construct a modus operandi (MO). The M.O. is a set of habits of a criminal and is a type of behavior used to characterize a pattern. The data of the burglaries include means of entry (front door, window, etc.), day of the week, characteristics of the property (apartment, house), and geographic proximity to other break-ins. Using nine known crime series of burglaries, Series Finder recovered most of the crimes within these patterns and also identified nine additional crimes.|$|E
5000|$|The Havanese is a toy dog. It {{is smart}} {{and can be}} easily trained. It is best to train this dog at a young age, because some habits will stick as they become older. However, {{training}} these dogs while they are older is still possible. Like many toy breeds, the Havanese {{can be difficult to}} <b>housebreak.</b> However, Havanese can be trained to use a litter box, which can greatly reduce issues with housebreaking. This breed is very smart and can be house trained faster than most toy dogs. The Havanese get very attached and are very loyal to their owners, and often attach to one person which they will closely follow. As a result, the Havanese does not do well in a household where it will be left alone all day. Although the Havanese is an active and lively dog, they are small enough that many of their exercise needs can be met in a house or yard, and therefore they do not require as much vigorous exercise as other breeds may. However, exercise is still necessary for this breed to be happy and healthy.|$|E
5000|$|Learning {{guitar and}} piano, Stewart began touring with local bands and writing songs in his teens. He married Mary Lou Taylor, {{more than three}} years his senior, at age {{seventeen}} and began working days in an airplane factory. He still played in rock and country bands at night. While playing in an Okeechobee, Florida, honky-tonk known as the Wagon Wheel, Stewart met country singer Mel Tillis, who advised Stewart to travel to Nashville to pitch his songs. He recorded a few songs for the small Cory label in 1964 and began co-writing songs with local policeman Bill Eldridge. Stewart and Eldridge wrote Stonewall Jackson's 1965 country hit, [...] "Poor Red Georgia Dirt". Signed to the Kapp label in 1968, Stewart made several unsuccessful recordings but several songwriting successes followed, for artists like Billy Walker ("She Goes Walking Through My Mind", [...] "Traces of a Woman", [...] "It's Time to Love Her"), Cal Smith ("You Can't <b>Housebreak</b> a Tomcat", [...] "It Takes Me All Night Long"), and Nat Stuckey ("Sweet Thang And Cisco"). He even played piano for a time in Charley Pride's band the Pridesmen, and can be heard on Pride's live In Person double-album. Disappointed with Music Row, however, he soon returned to Florida and resumed playing countrified rock 'n' roll in local clubs and bars.|$|E
40|$|A 28 month old {{spayed female}} Swiss Mountain Dog was {{presented}} to the Cornell University Small Animal Medicine service with history of urinary incontinence beginning at 15 months of age, a month after her ovariohysterectomy. Her owners reported that the dog was difficult to <b>housebreak</b> and had frequently urinated in the house as a puppy but was housebroken and continent for at least three months prior to her ovariohysterectomy. Two months prior to presentation she was diagnosed with and successfully treated for a urinary tract infection. Her referring veterinarian had presumptively diagnosed her with urinary sphincter mechanism incompetence and treated her with phenylpropanolamine (Proin®) and diethylstilbestrol with only intermittent relief. She was referred to Cornell for further diagnostic evaluation of her incontinence. 	On physical examination her vital parameters were within normal limits and no neurologic or other abnormalities were detected. A complete blood count, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and urine culture and sensitivity were performed with no significant abnormalities detected. A haired, freely movable, dermal mass was found on her left dorsal neck, aspirated and diagnosed as a mast cell tumor which was surgically managed by the Cornell University Small Animal Surgery service. 	The history and the results of the initial diagnostics, and neurologic examination suggested that the cause of the incontinence was either anatomical (ectopic ureter(s), vaginal strictures, urovaginal fistula, or urethrorectal fistula) or functional (urinary sphincter mechanism incompetence). In order to rule out some anatomicl causes of incontinence a full abdominal ultrasound, digital vaginal examination, and cystography were performed...|$|E
