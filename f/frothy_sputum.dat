5000|$|The {{most common}} symptom of {{pulmonary}} edema is difficulty breathing, but may include other {{symptoms such as}} coughing up blood (classically seen as pink, <b>frothy</b> <b>sputum),</b> excessive sweating, anxiety, and pale skin. Shortness of breath can manifest as orthopnea (inability to lie down flat due to breathlessness) and/or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (episodes of severe sudden breathlessness at night). These are common presenting symptoms of chronic pulmonary edema due to left ventricular failure. The development of pulmonary edema {{may be associated with}} symptoms and signs of [...] "fluid overload"; this is a non-specific term to describe the manifestations of left ventricular failure {{on the rest of the}} body and includes peripheral edema (swelling of the legs, in general, of the [...] "pitting" [...] variety, wherein the skin is slow to return to normal when pressed upon), raised jugular venous pressure and hepatomegaly, where the liver is enlarged and may be tender or even pulsatile. Other signs include end-inspiratory crackles (sounds heard at the end of a deep breath) on auscultation and the presence of a third heart sound.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Postoperative {{pulmonary}} edema is a fatal adverse event after a cardiac surgery. We here report successful management using airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) for severe hypoxia with {{pulmonary edema}} after a cardiac surgery. Presentation of case: A 58 -year-old man underwent an uneventful mitral valve repair. Immediately afterwards, the patient became agitated and made vigorous inspiratory efforts. His oxygen saturation dropped to 90 %. Coarse inspiratory rhonchi were heard on auscultation, and copious, pink, <b>frothy</b> <b>sputum</b> was obtained with suctioning. Initial chest radiograph showed right-sided patchy opacities and interstitial infiltrates. A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated normal cardiac function. With worsening respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation, APRV was attempted. His condition and blood gas was subsequently improved. Over the following 3  days, the patient experienced an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged to home on postoperative day 14. Discussion: Extracorponeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) {{is the most}} effective for severe hypoxia with pulmonary edema; however, ECMO is associated with hemorrhage and infectious complications. Alteratively, APRV was required for the successful management for severe hypoxia with pulmonary edema.

40|$|Background: Pulmonary oedema may {{complicate the}} {{perioperative}} {{period and the}} aetiology may be different from non-operative patients. Diagnosis may be difficult during anaesthesia and consequently management may be delayed. Objectives: To examine {{the role of a}} previously described core algorithm ‘‘COVER ABCD–A SWIFT CHECK’’, supplemented by a specific sub-algorithm for pulmonary oedema, in its management occurring in association with anaesthesia. Methods: The potential performance of this structured approach for each of the relevant incidents among the first 4000 reported to the Australian Incident Monitoring Study (AIMS) was compared with the actual management as reported by the anaesthetists involved. Results: Pulmonary oedema was identified in 35 (, 1 %) of the first 4000 reports to AIMS. The most frequent presenting sign was hypoxia (46 %) and the most specific sign was the presence of <b>frothy</b> <b>sputum</b> (23 %). The core algorithm, although successful in the management of the initial physiological upset, was found to be inadequate for the ongoing management of pulmonary oedema. A specific sub-algorithm for the management of perioperative pulmonary oedema was devised, tested against the reports and would have been effective, if properly applied, in the management of {{all but one of the}} reported cases...|$|E

40|$|Ikdenotonsillectomy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{surgical}} procedures performed in the United States. Postoperative bleeding is the most widely appreci-ated of the tonsillectomy complications; however, dysphagia, sore throat, and otalgia are some of the most common symptoms of patients who have un-dergone this surgical procedure. In most cases the dyspha;gia is self-limited, and significant pain in the child beyond 24 to 48 hours should alert the surgeon to possible infection. Only rarely does dysphagia persist beyond 10 days. If it does, it is thought o be related to excessive trauma to the pharyngeal mus-culature and possible scar tissue formation. 1 It is also well-recognized that psychological factors may play a role. 1 We present a case of a child in whom significant and protracted postoperative dysphagia with as-piration symptoms developed with very little odynophagia. CASE REPORT A 5 -year-old girl had a history of seven episodes of tonsillitis in 1 year. In April 1993, the patient underwent adenotc, nsillectomy without complications and with mini-mal blood loss. She recovered rapidly from anesthesia. Immediately after surgery she was noted to have poor oral intake, although she was wide awake and attempting to swallow. Because of this she was admitted for intravenous hydration. On postoperative day (POD) 1, she had a fever of 38. 8 ° C and continued to have dysphagia. It was initially believed to be caused by edema; however, she also had a cough productive of <b>frothy</b> <b>sputum,</b> and aspiration was clinically suspected.

40|$|SUMMARY Fracture of {{the short}} strut of the latest series of Bjork-Shiley mitral valve {{prostheses}} occurred 12 months after implantation. The patient died despite emergency surgery to excise and replace the prosthesis. Bjork-Shiley 29 - 33 mm valves with a 600 opening angle manufactured between February 1981 and March 1982 have a predicted strut fracture rate of 0. 3 % (three times {{greater than that of}} valves produced outside these dates). Unimplanted valves from this batch have now been recalled by the manufacturers. One of the most dramatic and tragic events associated with prosthetic heart valve replacement is sudden mechanical failure due to blockage or detachment from the surrounding tissues. The resulting heart failure is almost always fatal unless urgent replace-ment of the heart valve is undertaken. Equally drama-tic, but less well recognised, is fracture or dislocation of the prosthetic valve disc. We report a fatal case of sudden mechanical failure of a current series Bjork-Shiley mitral valve prosthesis due to fracture of the minor disc support strut one year after the valve was inserted. Case report A 52 year old woman with rheumatic heart disease underwent replacement of the mitral valve with a Bjork-Shiley MBRC 29 mm prosthesis and of the aor-tic valve with an Omniscience 23 mm prosthesis in July 1982. She was well during the next 12 months and was taking warfarin, dipyridamole, and digoxin. In July 1983 she suddently became short of breath, which was associated with faintness and tightness in the chest. On physical examination she was agitated, restless, cyanosed, clammy, and severely dyspnoeic and was coughing up white <b>frothy</b> <b>sputum.</b> The pulse rate was irregular at 120 beats/min and the blood pres-sure unrecordable. Her jugular veins were distended up to the ear lobes. Exaniination of the chest showed coarse bilateral basal crepitations. Prosthetic sound...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Irrigation or washouts of {{the bladder}} are usually {{performed}} in various clinical settings. In the 1980 s Elliot and colleagues argued that urothelial damage could occur after washouts and irrigations of the bladder. The exact mechanism underlying urothelial damage {{has not yet}} been discovered. To our knowledge, this is the first report of fatal fluid overload and pulmonary edema, due to urothelium disruption occurring during bladder irrigation, approached performing complete histological and immunohistochemical investigation on bladder specimens. The exposed case deserves attention since it demonstrates that, although very rarely, irrigation or washouts of the bladder may have unexpected serious clinical consequences. CASE PRESENTATION: An 85 year-old Caucasian man, unable to eat independently and whose fluid intake was controlled, underwent continuous bladder irrigation with a 3 -way catheter due to a severe episode of macrohematuria. During the third day of hospitalization, while still undergoing bladder irrigation, he suddenly experienced extreme shortness of breath, breathing difficulties, and cough with <b>frothy</b> <b>sputum.</b> His attending nurse immediately noted that there was no return of the fluid (5 liters) introduced through bladder irrigation. He was treated urgently with hemodialysis. At the beginning of the dialysis treatment, the patient had gained 7. 4 kg since the previous measurement (24 hours prior) without any clear explanation. Although a significant weight loss (from 81 to 76 kg) due to the dialysis procedure, the patient died shortly after the final treatment. The autopsy revealed that the brain and the lungs were heavily edematous. Microscopic examination of bladder specimens revealed interstitial and mucosal swelling, and loss of the superficial cell layer. Intermediate and basal urothelial cells were preserved. Altogether the above mentioned findings were suggestive of a diffuse disruption of the urothelium. In conclusion the death of the man was attributed to an acute severe pulmonary edema due to massive fluid absorption. CONCLUSION: Our case demonstrates that urothelium disruption may occur during irrigation and washouts of the bladder, also in the absence of other well-known predisposing conditions. Inappropriate use of bladder irrigation should be avoided and a close attention is required of the fluid balance is mandatory when irrigating the bladder...|$|E
