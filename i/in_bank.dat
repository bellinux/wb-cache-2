Lee, an audiophile and engineer, was experimenting with {{different}} copper qualities, wire constructs and winding methods of audio cables in his family's garage and comparing them while listening to Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. He became convinced that audio cables could be engineered to improve audio quality by conducting electricity more efficiently. Using a borrowed portion of somebody's booth at the 1978 Consumer Electronics Show, he did demonstrations of his cables in comparison to standard wires. After a positive reception at CES, he quit his job at Lawrence Berkeley Lab and started Monster Cable Products with $250,000 <b>in</b> <b>bank</b> financing. Monster's first cables were manufactured by Lee by hand and sold door-to-door.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{occurs in}} many rodent species. In some rodents, males {{are larger than}} females, while in others the reverse is true. Male-bias sexual dimorphism is typical for ground squirrels, kangaroo rats, solitary mole rats, and pocket gophers; it likely developed due to sexual selection and greater male-male combat. Female-bias sexual dimorphism exists among chipmunks and jumping mice. It is not understood why this pattern occurs, {{but in the case}} of yellow-pine chipmunks, males may have selected larger females due to their greater reproductive success. In some species, such as voles, sexual dimorphism can vary from population to population. <b>In</b> <b>bank</b> voles, females are typically larger than males, but male-bias sexual dimorphism occurs in alpine populations, possibly because of the lack of predators and greater competition between males.|$|E

This thesis investigates the relationship between workflow automation and organizational structure <b>in</b> <b>banking</b> and financial services. It first analyzes the levels of workflow automation, investigates the degree of centralization <b>in</b> <b>banks,</b> examines some representative processes in real world settings, and finally develops a theoretical framework to address the relationship of workflow automation and organizational structure <b>in</b> <b>banking</b> processes. The results of this research will provide useful insights and guidelines {{on how to improve}} the efficiency of business operations <b>in</b> <b>banks</b> by adopting workflow automation to satisfy the changing business requirements <b>in</b> <b>banking</b> and financial services...|$|R

5|$|The Environment Agency is {{responsible}} for monitoring water quality on the river and its tributaries, which have been divided into seventeen separate water bodies. In 2013, seven water bodies were assessed as having good quality and ten as being moderate. The reasons for not achieving good status included pollution from waste water, pollution from agriculture and physical modifications. The physical modifications include dredging work on the lower reaches, near the junction with the Parrett to increase the channel flow to reduce flooding. The use and storage of the dredged material <b>in</b> <b>bank</b> restoration may also have an impact. In 1998 improvements were sought to treatment works and surface water outfalls to improve water quality. A vegetable washing plant on the Chelston stream at Wellington was also identified {{as a source of}} pollution. The waters of the Upper Tone have been classified as having good ecological status, whereas the section from Wellington to Taunton and downstrean of Taunton are rated as moderate.|$|E
5|$|The {{silver dollar}} {{had never been}} a popular coin, {{circulating}} little except in the West; it served as a means of monetizing metal and generally sat <b>in</b> <b>bank</b> vaults once struck. The Peace dollar, the last circulating dollar made of silver, was not struck after 1935, and in most years in the quarter century after that, the bullion value of a silver dollar did not exceed 70 cents. In the early 1960s, though, silver prices rose, and the huge stocks of silver dollars in the hands of banks and the government were obtained by the public through the redemption of silver certificates. This caused shortages of silver dollars in the western states where the pieces circulated, and interests there sought the issuance of more dollars.|$|E
