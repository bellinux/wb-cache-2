This alternate arrangement was created as a way to get the <b>frame</b> <b>clamp</b> of the derailleur closer to the bottom bracket to be able to clear larger suspension components and allow different frame shapes. The compact construction of a top swing derailleur can cause it to be less robust than its bottom swing counterpart. Top swing derailleurs are typically only used in applications where a bottom swing derailleur will not fit. An alternative solution would be to use an E-type front derailleur, which does not clamp around the seat tube at all.|$|E

40|$|Dielectric {{membranes}} with exceptional {{mechanical and}} optical properties present {{one of the}} most promising platforms in quantum opto-mechanics. The performance of stressed silicon nitride nanomembranes as mechanical resonators notoriously depends on how their <b>frame</b> is <b>clamped</b> to the sample mount, which in practice usually necessitates delicate, and difficult-to-reproduce mounting solutions. Here, we demonstrate that a phononic bandgap shield integrated in the membrane's silicon frame eliminates this dependence, by suppressing dissipation through phonon tunneling. We dry-etch the membrane's frame so that it assumes the form of a cm-sized bridge featuring a 1 -dimensional periodic pattern, whose phononic density of states is tailored to exhibit one, or several, full band gaps around the membrane's high-Q modes in the MHz-range. We quantify the effectiveness of this phononic bandgap shield by optical interferometry measuring both the suppressed transmission of vibrations, as well as the influence of <b>frame</b> <b>clamping</b> conditions on the membrane modes. We find suppressions up to 40 dB and, for three different realized phononic structures, consistently observe significant suppression of the dependence of the membrane's modes on sample clamping - if the mode's frequency lies in the bandgap. As a result, we achieve membrane mode quality factors of 5 × 10 ^ 6 with samples that are tightly bolted to the 8 K-cold finger of a cryostat. Q× f-products of 6 × 10 ^ 12 Hz at 300 K and 14 × 10 ^ 12 Hz at 8 K are observed, satisfying one of the main requirements for optical cooling of mechanical vibrations to their quantum ground-state.

40|$|In recent years, much {{research}} has been devoted in understanding and production of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) parts. Still, the overall costs of CFRP-parts are high and offer potential for reduction. To {{be able to compete}} with metallic parts it is necessary to analyze the complete CFRP-part production process with focus on optimization and reduction of costs. In this work two optimization aspects along the production chain of thermoformed CFRP-parts are being addressed: -Turning a 3 -step process into a 2 -step process -Reduction of manual interaction At the first issue the effect on the part quality by dropping the consolidation step of the ply-package to an organo sheet is examined. The common production process of thermoplastic CFRP-parts includes the processing of organo sheets. These organo sheets can be produced by vacuum- or press consolidation, which are representing very time, energy and therefore cost intensive steps. For this investigation the unconsolidated ply-package is directly inserted into a <b>clamping</b> <b>frame</b> and subsequently transferred to an infrared (IR) preheating station. In this station the ply-package is thermally activated and after achieving process temperature it is formed to the final geometry by the hot press. Here the influence of variation of different process parameter to the quality of thermoformed parts is evaluated. The investigated process parameter are including the number and position of the welding points at single plies, the dwell time and temperature at the IR-station as well as pressure, duration and temperature during the press step. Afterwards the quality of the parts that has been produced with and without the consolidation step is analyzed and compared against the background of efficiency. With the second issue the enhancement of the level of automation is addressed. On that score the transport of the ply-packages / organo sheets inside a <b>clamping</b> <b>frame</b> along the thermoforming process is investigated. For this purpose a special <b>clamping</b> <b>frame</b> was developed, that is able to strain the organo sheet automatically and keeps it under continuous tension and allows the necessary flexibility during the whole process. With the application of this <b>clamping</b> <b>frame</b> we are able {{to get rid of the}} manual spring mounting into the organo sheet, the actual state of the art, which results in shorter cycle times and reduced effort. This paper shows that the production of thermoformed parts can be optimized at several points. By choosing the right process parameters we aim to drop the consolidation step. Furthermore the cycle time can be reduced by use of an automatic <b>clamping</b> <b>frame.</b> These achievements can contribute to a lower total price of thermoplastic CFRP-parts and therefore enhance their position at the competition with metallic parts...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of blast-loaded steel plates is studied both experimentally and numerically. The blast loading was generated using a shock tube facility.

Massive and deform- able steel plates where located at the tube end during testing, where the massive-plate tests served {{as a basis for}} comparison with respect to ﬂuid-structure interaction (FSI) effects. Special focus was placed on the inﬂuence of pre-formed holes on the dynamic response and failure characteristics of the deformable plates. The plates had an exposed area of 0. 3 m £ 0. 3 m and the tests covered a wide range of structural responses from large inelastic deformations to complete tearing along the diagonals of the plates. Numerical simula- tions were performed in the ﬁnite element code EUROPLEXUS, where the plate was uniformly loaded by the pressure measurements from the massive-plate tests. The plate deformation and the observed crack propagation were successfully recreated by using element erosion and adaptive mesh reﬁnement in the plate, driven by the damage parameter in the material model. As expected, the simulations overestimated the plate deformations due to the underlying assumption that the blast pressure was uncoupled from the deformation (i. e., neglecting FSI).

A total of 178 (65 %) of the 274 eligible patients who were offered entry into a randomized trial of new versus refurbished external fixation components for their injury refused to participate, leaving 96 (35 %) of the 274 eligible patients entered into the study. INTERVENTION: Consented patients were entered into a trial of new versus refurbished nonimplantable external fixation components for their injury (all pins were new).

40|$|Mass and {{stiffness}} properties of real structures {{are different from}} those considered in design since simplified hypotheses are usually made and because the collaboration of non-structural elements and details are important. When structural problems are investigated (such as pathologies, serviceability and vibration comfort, etc.), knowledge of the actual response of the structure is needed with precision. Therefore, the source of the problem can be identified and solution in terms of reinforcement and possible retrofitting can be proposed. In this Master Thesis dynamic analysis and field data measurement is used in order to identify the parameters of complex structures. A real case study is considered, consisting in an office building with serviceability problems due to vibration. The structural system consists of steel frames; a bus ramp exists coupled to the building which introduces a dynamic excitation. The steel frames span over 17, 23 metres without intermediate columns, which leads to low Eigenfrequencies. All <b>frame</b> nodes are <b>clamped,</b> a perimeter steel profile has clamped joints too. Between frames over the distance of 8, 6 metres mixed beams are spanned, consisting of steel profile pinned to the frames and concrete slabs on a trapezoidal sheeting. Due to this concrete slabs the floors were assumed diaphragms in horizontal directions. A ramp is connected to the building. This ramp consists of longitudinal steel profiles carrying a trapezoidal sheeting as lost formwork with a concrete slab and an asphalt layer above. Those longitudinal profiles rest on transversal steel frames. The steel frames consist of a series of columns on one side and horizontal profiles which on the other side directly join the building frame´s column. Thus, whenever a vehicle excites the ramp, this vibration is transferred directly to the building, affecting serviceability and comfort. The objective of the research is to investigate the actual behaviour of the building and the possible imperfect connections. After the system is identified, possible actions are investigated in order to improve the service behaviour and comfort. In order to achieve this aim, dynamic traffic loads are simulated by a series of time history functions. Bus passes are simulated and measured under different velocities. As a result the ramp´s Eigenfrequency is 11, 1 Hz, and acts as excitation frequency on the building. Especially on the first frame, which has different vibration modes than the others, this excitation frequency matches with a horizontal frame Eigenfrequency, leading to notable accelerations on the floors...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{manufacturing}} processes are strongly affected by part and process variations. Understanding the final {{shape of the}} assembly is a crucial task to be achieved during the design stage to reduce cost and production time. Typically, when parts are put together variations propagate part-to-part. This stack-up effect is strictly related to part deviations, assembly sequence, assembly constraints, part flexibility. All these fac-tors combine into a non-linear way. Technical literature provides valid methodologies to analyze tolerance stack-up problems. In this contest, assemblies are usually classified into two main categories: rigid assemblies and compliant assemblies. In the first case, parts are assumed ideal-rigid and the additional variation due to elastic or plastic defor-mation is not accounted. When the flexibility of parts is not negligible, as into manufac-turing processes involving sheet-metal parts, its effect has to be accounted into numeri-cal simulations. This dissertation provides {{a contribution to the}} modeling and the simu-lation both of rigid and compliant assemblies. With respect to rigid assembly, a general methodology, called SVA-TOL (Sta-tistical Variation Analysis for Tolerancing), is proposed. The methodology is based into two main steps. Tolerance specifications are modeled in the first step following Interna-tional Standard rules. Variational features are so generated. Then, by using these varia-tional features, assembly constraints are modeled as combination of elementary geome-try entities: points, lines and planes. Two assembly solvers are illustrated: the sequential solver and the least squares solver. The sequential solver allows to analyze assembly constraints taking into account the assembly sequence. Specific mathematical tools, such as Screw Theory and Graph Theory, are here adopted to automatically calculate the list of degrees of freedom al-lowed for a specific part being assembled. The least squares solver, instead, permits to analyze all assembly constraint si-multaneously by best fitting all mating conditions. Case studies have pointed out the field of applicability of proposed assembly solvers. With respect to compliant assembly, a general frame-work, called SVA-FEA (Statistical Variation Analysis & Finite Element Analysis), is presented. SVA-FEA al-lows to statistically simulate single- and multi-station assembly processes under linear assumptions. A Global Sensitivity Matrix is introduced to link input part or process de-viations and output assembly deviations. In this way, no Monte Carlo simulation is needed. The whole assembly process is based on the Place, Clamp, Fasten and Release (PCFR) cycle. Parts are positioned on fixturing <b>frames,</b> where are <b>clamped</b> and fastened. Then, they are released reaching their final assembly configuration. To numerically cal-culate the sensitivity matrix two FEA runs, performed on the nominal geometry, are re-quired. The first one calculates the fixturing and fastening forces, by applying the method of influence coefficients. These forces are then applied into the second FEA run to simulate the final elastic spring-back. SVA-FEA methodology has been implemented into a friendly MatLAB®’s GUI, allowing to define the whole assembly process, with its variability, and to visualize the final assembly deviations, in terms on mean and standard deviations. Two significant case studies have highlighted how SVA-FEA al-lows to simulate both single- and multi-station assembly processes. Results have been compared with ones coming from commercial CAT software, showing a good numeri-cal correlation. SVA-FEA assumes that input statistical deviations are independent among them. This means that no covariance effect is accounted. To overcome this weakness, a new non-linear methodology is also proposed. The non-linear methodology, to do variational analysis of compliant assembly, uses a Monte Carlo approach to statistically generate input free shape geometry. The methodology can be described as follows. For each Monte Carlo step, input geometry is generated according to an automatic morphing mesh procedure. Then, the PCFR cycle is simulated. The geometry is so updated for each phase of the PCFR cycle. To reach more realistic results, contact pairs, defined as surface-to-surface type, may be introduced into the numerical simulation. The morphing mesh approach allows to generated free shape parts starting from few control points, defined on the nominal geometry, and setting the tolerance error value. Finally, critical remarks are outlined, highlighting future directions of research in the field of tolerance analysis of rigid and compliant assembly processes...|$|R
