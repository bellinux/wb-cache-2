40|$|Legislative {{tort reform}} {{proposals}} {{have attempted to}} restore what {{is perceived to be}} an imbalance in the tort-litigation system by limiting tort recoveries. One of the motivating factors behind tort reform proposals is a concern that tort law has deviated from a <b>fault-based</b> system of <b>liability.</b> It is this concern over the structure of the fault system in Minnesota {{that is the subject of}} this Article. This Article examines Minnesota Supreme Court opinions of the 20 th Century to determine whether the court 2 ̆ 7 s decisions deviated from a <b>fault-based</b> system of <b>liability.</b> The focus is on change, accepted and rejected. The purpose is to determine whether the claim that the tort system is based on a primary judicial desire to compensate victims of accidents can be established, and what implications the court 2 ̆ 7 s decisions might have for determining what type of tort reform legislation should be enacted, at least insofar as claims are made that the deep-pocket or social insurance principle justifies change...|$|R
40|$|Public {{enforcement}} of the Clean Water Act (CWA) has been characterized by {{the increased use of}} criminal sanctions over the past decade. This sanctioning trend has developed in direct response to the passage of the Sentencing Reform Act (SRA) as part of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. New sentencing guidelines were established in 1987 under which courts were required to impose sentences which reflect the seriousness of the offense, provide just punishment for the offense, and afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct. Legal trends are documented for both industrial and agricultural violations as a result of applying the new federal sentencing guidelines to CWA cases. The efficiency implications of the SRA are evaluated {{in the context of a}} model of the public {{enforcement of}} environmental law. It is concluded that <b>fault-based</b> standards of <b>liability</b> and the use of mixed fine/incarceration sanctions are appropriate for agricultural violations of the CWA...|$|R
40|$|The {{pursuit of}} {{healthcare}} quality {{is a global}} trend as countries attempt to maximise the usage of resources amidst concerns about increasing costs and patient safety. The incentives for high quality care were traditionally provided by the tort system of medical negligence; however, modifications to this system saw it replaced in the UK in 1990 with a <b>fault-based</b> enterprise <b>liability</b> system (NHS Indemnity) - NHS trusts were now indemnified for clinical negligence claims {{in return for the}} payment of insurance premiums to the NHSLA which assumed responsibility for claims management. The incentives for quality care in this system evolved to a system of risk management standards in the 2002 - 2009 period – such standards offered reputational and financial benefits to trusts who achieved higher risk management levels (the attainment of such higher levels is proposed to be dependent on the trust governance structure and financial health), and the impact of this system on the clinical negligence outcomes of NHS trusts is the particular focus of this study. A lack of suitable data restricted previous studies of the effectiveness of risk management standards; however, the availability of such data permitted an empirical analysis of a unique panel database. This analysis initially found that the adoption of a new governance structure (i. e. foundation trust) is significantly associated with higher risk management levels, while efficient risk management processes are found to be significantly associated with lower numbers of clinical negligence claims. Finally, foundation trusts were found to be associated with higher closed claim values i. e. such trusts are willing to offer higher amounts to settle claims early. Overall, this study supports the proposition that more efficient risk management processes will lead to improved clinical negligence outcomes for NHS trusts, and recommendations are offered to assist trusts to become more efficient at risk management...|$|R
40|$|Aside {{from the}} {{principle}} of irretrievable breakdown, {{the principle of}} <b>fault-based</b> <b>liability</b> {{is one of the}} two primary principles of Austrian divorce law. Based on the applicable principle of <b>fault-based</b> <b>liability,</b> a spouse can impose an immediate divorce against the will of the other spouse only if the marriage has irretrievably broken down due to a severe violation of the marriage contract. Otherwise the spouse intending to divorce has to wait until the require- ments for a divorce due to an irretrievable breakdown are in place, in particular a severing of the marriage bond for three years (in special hardship cases up to six years). The question as to which of the two spouses is at fault for the failure of the marriage also impacts the consequences of divorce, in particular the claims of the divorced spouses with regard to maintenance and social insurance. Since, according to available statistics, male spouses far more frequently commit severe violations of the marriage contract than female spouses, and women, due to the housekeeping and child-rearing that they undertake with far greater frequency, are significantly more often dependent on maintenance than men, an elimination of the principle of <b>fault-based</b> <b>liability</b> from Austrian divorce law would have a generally disadvantageous effect for women with regard to gender relations...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contains}} the chapters on public enforcement {{of law and}} on criminal law from a general, forthcoming book, Foundations of Economic Analysis of Law (Harvard University Press, 2003). By public law enforcement is meant {{the use of public}} law enforcement agents [...] such as police, tax inspectors, regulatory personnel [...] to enforce legal rules. A number of important dimensions of public law enforcement may be distinguished. One is the choice of the basic rule of liability: whether liability is strict or <b>fault-based,</b> and whether <b>liability</b> is imposed only if harm is done or may be imposed on the basis of acts alone (independently of the occurrence of harm). A second dimension of enforcement is the type of sanction, whether monetary or nonmonetary, notably, imprisonment. A third aspect of enforcement is the magnitude of sanctions. And a fourth dimension of enforcement is the degree of enforcement effort, which determines the probability of imposition of sanctions. These dimensions of enforcement are discussed in the chapters that follow. In chapter 20, the basic theory of public enforcement employing monetary sanctions is discussed; in chapter 21, the basic theory of enforcement using nonmonetary sanctions is examined; and in chapter 22, extensions to the basic theory are considered. Then, in chapter 23, functions of sanctions apart from deterrence, namely, incapacitation, rehabilitation, and retribution, are discussed. Finally, in chapter 24, the subject of criminal law is addressed against the background of the theory of public enforcement of law. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{situations where}} legal liability yields insufficient incentives for socially efficient behavior, e. g., individuals who cause harm {{are not always}} sued or are unable to pay fully for harm done. Some individuals nevertheless behave efficiently because of intrinsic prosocial concerns. Others have no such concerns but would like {{people to believe that}} they do. We show that <b>fault-based</b> <b>liability</b> is generally more effective than strict liability in harnessing social image concerns. This extends to the case where courts can make mistakes. The rules of proof then affect the inferences drawn from court decisions and therefore the stigma attached to an adverse judgment. If fault is a rare event, plaintiffs or prosecutors should bear the burden of proving the defendant’s fault; otherwise there are cases where defendants should prove compliance with the legal standard of behavior. Under either assignment of the burden of proof, incentives to comply are maximized by a standard of proof stronger than a mere preponderance of evidence...|$|E

Should the rule of liability be strict or fault-based? If violators are caught only with a probability, how should the level of the sanction be adjusted?

40|$|An {{important}} issue in Taiwan today concerns the rising tension between strict liability and negligence. Article 191 - 3 of the Civil Code of Taiwan imposes a fault-based standard of liability on persons conducting dangerous activities. On the other hand, {{the majority of}} scholars believe that to afford greater protection, this rule should be changed into a strict liability rule. Traditionally, three arguments make it preferable to impose strict liability under certain circumstances. First, strict liability induces more safety incentives {{on the part of}} the defendant. Second, fairness requires that one who benefits from conducting dangerous activities should bear the risk of loss. Finally, the defendant is better able to spread the loss to the general public. However, based on the analysis of each justification, this Dissertation finds that all of these arguments fail. Accordingly, this Dissertation argues that intermediate liability, a variation under negligence principles, is a proper standard of liability when high risk of harm is involved;—i. e. Article 191 - 3 is proper in imposing <b>fault-based</b> <b>liability</b> to dangerous activities—for the following three reasons: 1) intermediate liability provides additional safety incentives by shifting the burden of proof to the defendant; 2) it conforms to fairness; and 3) it does not consider tort law as a means of insurance...|$|E
30|$|Liability rules induce {{manufacturers}} and users to take special care—at least when those rules involve so-called <b>fault-based</b> <b>liability,</b> meaning that liability ensues {{only as a}} result of negligent or deliberate action. The contemporary state of liability law reflects this development: The events giving rise to a claim for damages are preponed in so far as the breaching of a duty of care prior to the actual occurrence of a damage-inflicting incident may already suffice for establishing damage liability. In this respect, the particular actual conditions of service robot employment need to be taken into consideration when establishing a duty of care; especially, obligations to inform have received a prominent role. However, much of the information can not even be processed in the short time available. On the one hand, comprehensibility is a significant requirement {{when it comes to the}} operation of service robots. On the other hand, it may lead to a drop-off in the controllability—and consequently in the adaptability—of service robots. Moreover, vagueness in communication with the robot must be handled. Thus, liability rules can promote standardization and technical formalization. Simultaneously, however, they can diminish the impact of service robots. This also shows that the users of service robots can likewise be encumbered with duties of care, the non-observation of which could lead to a partitioning of liability.|$|E
40|$|The new Czech Civil code (CC) {{traditionally}} {{does not}} define causation and leaves this task to the judiciary and legal theory. Despite this statutory “silence”, {{the changes that}} stand behind the CC {{may lead to a}} conception of causation that is very different from that which has been used in the Czech Republic until recently. The aim {{of this article is to}} develop this new theory of causation which is based on an analysis of two crucial reformative features of the CC. In particular, the author seeks to answer how our conception of causation might be influenced by the declared (1) departure from materialism and (2) inclination to the idealistic western tradition. He examines the extra-contractual <b>fault-based</b> <b>liability</b> regime (§ 2910 CC) by a historical, doctrinal and comparative method and shows that the causation under current Czech law can be understood as a two phased ideal test of factual and legal causation (i. e. a relation between a breach of a duty and damage). However, the factual causation test is only a negative one. A positive legal causation (adequacy/scope of liability) is then implied by the statute. According to the CC, the causal link can be presumed where the damage was foreseeable by a rational average human, or by a person of average abilities. Each of these two presumptions plays a crucial role when assessing different causation (relating to primary or consequential damage). This theory may then substantially strengthen the procedural position of the claimant...|$|E
40|$|It was {{not very}} long ago that Western law was formed from the rib of Graeco-Roman law, and our modern Western legal systems, civil code-based and common law alike, {{demonstrate}} that lineage, and the contributions of both societies, to surcease. While other cultural influences, including those from even more ancient sources may be identifiable, this article segregates Greco-Roman law for separate analysis for purposes of manageability. This article tracks the law of early Greece and early Rome from their respective origins in myth and legend to their comprehensive codifications. For the disparities in form and content, there are nonetheless significant similarities. These include (1) the cohering of laws giving security to society; (2) the movement from vengeance as a remedy to compensation; (3) the identification of a great array of personal injury and dignitary wrongs, as well as wrongs to property interests for which civil remedies might be sought; (4) the introduction of <b>fault-based</b> <b>liability</b> for certain harms; and (5) the introduction of equity so as to permit the rendition of justice in circumstances in which existing law or its absence might preclude it. The article concludes with {{the proposition that the}} law of ancient Greece, and that of ancient Rome, each contributed a necessary, but not by itself sufficient, foundation of the Western law that would follow. To the Hellenic contribution of ethics, dialectical reasoning and rudimentary codification would be added Roman systematization and a millennium of cultural and legal tradition that resulted in the great Graeco-Roman law traditions that have left a lasting imprint on the terrain of modern Western law...|$|E
40|$|New Zealand and Canadian {{courts are}} willing to reduce the {{liability}} of a fiduciary for breach of fiduciary duty {{to take account of}} the claimant’s contributory fault, whereas English and Australian courts are not. The picture is less clear as regards breaches of trust not involving a breach of fiduciary duty, such as merely careless breaches of trust. English courts have assumed that there is no scope in any case of breach of trust for reducing trustee liability to take account of the beneficiary’s contributory fault, but this paper demonstrates that there is no binding authority to that effect. In the absence of authority the matter falls to be determined as a matter of principle. There are a number of obstacles of principle in the way of apportionment of liability between trustee and beneficiary on the ground of contributory fault. One significant obstacle is the basic difference between the compensatory aim of tortious liability and the traditional aim of trustee liability to reinstate the trust fund by means of the action for account. Another is the exemplary nature of trustee liability, which favours the enforcement of trust obligations even where this might over compensate individual beneficiaries. Significant though these obstacles are, it is demonstrated that they can be overcome {{in the case of a}} careless breach by the trustee of a bare trust. In such a case there is no significant difference between the conceptual basis for, and remedies for, negligently caused harm in tort actions and actions for breach of trust. The trustee’s <b>fault-based</b> <b>liability</b> in such a case should therefore be capable of reduction to take account of the beneficiary’s own fault...|$|E
40|$|Tort and contract, {{although}} both descended {{from a common}} ancestor in the forms of action at common law, are generally regarded as distinct species of civil liability. A tort is an act or omission that is marked by fault - either intention or negligence. There are also a few strict liability torts - where fault is not required - but they are rare. The damage for which tort provides a remedy is usually physical - either personal injury or property damages - albeit with consequential financial losses included. Pure economic loss remains an exception. Contract is not <b>fault-based.</b> <b>Liability</b> rests on a finding that the defendant bound itself to an obligation, and that the obligation has been broken. The typical damage in contract is usually purely financial, and physical damage in contract is the exception. Because of their different starting points, the two sorts of claims appeal to different parts of our sense of justice and have different dynamics. Tort plaintiffs are calling upon the law to redress a wrong inflicted on them, whereas contract plaintiffs seek to hold defendants to their promises. Of course, there are contract cases whose overtones are more like tort, and vice versa. The author looks at the way tort law has developed in relation to contractual situations, particularly pure economic loss claims in tort, which generally stem from contractual arrangements that have gone wrong. Both tort and contract function as devices for allocating risk. Tort does so after the risk has materialized; contract, within certain limits, allows the parties {{to do so in}} advance. The interrelationship between these two means of risk allocation is one of the themes of the paper...|$|E
40|$|By {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, and after a long line of {{conflicting}} case law, the question about the basis of liability in nuisance was settled: in Scotland, damages are awarded only upon proof of fault (RHM Bakeries (Scotland) Ltd v Strathclyde Regional Council 1985 SC (HL) 17). Fault, in turn, can adopt many forms: malice, intention, recklessness, negligence, and conduct causing a special risk of abnormal damage (Kennedy v Glenbelle Ltd 1995 SC 95). Many aspects of this seemingly clear picture, however, remain problematic. On the one hand, the way in which this model is interpreted and applied gives place to particular forms of liability that can actually be characterised as strict. On the other hand, two other areas of the law of neighbours that overlap with the scope of nuisance do not fit entirely this model, namely the regulation of disputes over uses of water and of those arising from withdrawal of support. The main argument of this thesis is that damages claims in the context of neighbourhood are governed by two distinct rules: a general <b>fault-based</b> <b>liability</b> rule for nuisance, and an exceptional strict liability rule for abnormally dangerous conduct. For the first of these rules, the thesis offers an evaluation of the fault model adopted in Kennedy v Glenbelle Ltd, explaining the interaction between its different elements and highlighting the developments that can result in forms of strict liability. For the second of these rules, the thesis develops an analysis of its elements and nature, as well as a proposal that delineates its scope of application. This two-rule model offers a justification for the current structure of the law applicable to disputes over uses of water. The strict liability rule applicable to interferences with the natural flow of watercourses, traditionally explained as based upon the infringement of property rights, is better explained as danger-based. The regulation of disputes arising from withdrawal of support, however, is not consistent with this model, even though they have also been characterised as nuisances. It is argued that this framework entails unjustified inconsistencies, both internal and by reference to the model proposed, and that it should be adjusted accordingly...|$|E
40|$|The New EU Directive on Environmental Liability {{provides}} for the system of liability for damage to the environment provoked by human activity. The Directive further {{provides for}} direct application of polluter-pays principles, the concept of environmental damage {{and a variety of}} preventive and remedial actions. The underlying principle of the Directive is the establishment of financial liability of the operators whose actions provoke environmental damage or the danger of occurrence of the environmental damage, all with the aim to stimulate such operators to adopt appropriate measures and procedures to diminish of environmental risks and therefore decrease their disposure to the environmental liability. Directive is applicable to the operators of the „regulated activities“, which includes the majority of industries. Directive is relating only to the future environmental damages occurred after its entry in force. Directive adopts strict liability for the operators of the activities dangerous to the environment applicable to any and all environmental damage, whereas for the operators of all other activities the <b>fault-based</b> <b>liability</b> applies and only in respect to the environmental damage of the ecosystem. Operators are not liable for damage provoked by third party, damage occurred regardless of the implementation of the appropriate protection procedures or damage in case of a force majeure event. Also, operators can waive responsibility invoking the so-called “state of art defense”, i. e. arguing that the harmful action was considered environmental friendly by the time of its occurrence. Another waiver from the responsibility, the so-called permit defense is possible in case whereof environmental damage is provoked by the action which was made in accordance with the issued permit/state authorization. Directive obliges the operators to inform relevant authorities of environmental damage risks which occur due to the operators’ activities, as well as to undertake appropriate measures of control, limitation, security, removal of harmful effects and risk/damage management. Directive defines the preventive measures as the measures instituted in response to an event, action or failure to act which created the threat of environmental damage, which measures aim to prevent or mitigate the consequences of such environmental damage. Directive further defines remedial measures as measures or combination of measures, including risk/damage management and provisional measures, with the aim to revoke, rehabilitate or replace damaged natural resources. Directive recommends to the Member States to encourage the operators to contract appropriate insurances and other financial cover from liability. Bearing in mind the development of environmental liability issue, it is uncertain whether and how will the insurance companies build new insurance policies in alternative to the classical insurance from civil responsibility which is only in small part applicable to the environmental damages. The same can be said for the financial market itself, knowing that the entire success of the Directive depends on the financial capacities of the operators to assume the liabilities introduced by the Directive. Pursuant to the Directive, companies shall have to bear themselves the risks of removal of consequences of environmental damage. We are of opinion that a respectable company cannot afford non-cooperation with the authorities, otherwise it risks refusal of work permits, investigations and inspections, refusal of state loans and other benefits. In the aim of prevention of environmental damage, the company management would need to develop internal rules and regulations on environmental protection and environmental policy of the company. Although we admit that Directive creates some preconditions for efficient and uniform implementation of the environmental protection and the achievement of sustainable development within the EU, we believe that Directive can help the prevention of environmental damage only in combination with corresponding fiscal and administrative privilege given to the companies willing to introduce and apply preventive environmental measures...|$|E
40|$|The Internet has {{transformed}} the economics of communication, creating a spirited debate about {{the proper role of}} federal, state, and international governments in regulating conduct related to the Internet. Many argue that Internet communications should be entirely self-regulated because such communications cannot or should not be the subject of government regulation. The advocates of that approach would prefer a no-regulation zone around Internet communications, based largely on the unexamined view that Internet activity is fundamentally different in a way that justifies broad regulatory exemption. At the same time, some kinds of activity that the Internet facilitates undisputedly violate widely shared norms and legal rules. State legislatures motivated by that concern have begun to respond with Internet-specific laws directed at particular contexts, giving little or no credence to the claims that the Internet needs special treatment. This Article starts from the realist assumption that government regulation of the Internet is inevitable. Thus, instead of focusing on the naive question of whether the Internet should be regulated, this Article discusses how to regulate Internet-related activity {{in a way that is}} consistent with approaches to analogous offline conduct. The Article also assumes that the Internet 2 ̆ 7 s most salient characteristic is that it inserts intermediaries into relationships that could be, and previously would have been, conducted directly in an offline environment. Existing liability schemes generally join traditional <b>fault-based</b> <b>liability</b> rules with broad Internet-specific liability exemptions. Those exemptions are supported by the premise that in many cases the conduct of the intermediaries is so wholly passive as to make liability inappropriate. Over time, this has produced a great volume of litigation, mostly in the context of the piracy of copyrighted works, in which the responsibility of the intermediary generally turns on fault, as measured by the intermediary 2 ̆ 7 s level of involvement in the challenged conduct. This Article argues that the pervasive role of intermediaries calls not for a broad scheme of exoneration, premised on passivity, but rather for a more thoughtful development of principles for determining when and how it makes economic sense to allocate responsibility for wrongful conduct to the least cost avoider. The Internet 2 ̆ 7 s rise has brought about three changes that make intermediaries more likely to be least cost avoiders in the Internet context than they previously have been in offline contexts: (1) an increase in the likelihood that it will be easy to identify specific intermediaries for large classes of transactions, (2) a reduction in information costs, which makes it easier for the intermediaries to monitor the conduct of end users, and (3) increased anonymity, which makes remedies against end users generally less effective. Accordingly, in cases where intermediaries can feasibly control the conduct, this Article recommends serious attention to the possibility of one of three different schemes of intermediary liability: traditional liability for damages, takedown schemes in which the intermediary must remove offensive content upon proper notice, and 2 ̆ 7 hot list 2 ̆ 2 schemes in which the intermediary must avoid facilitation of transactions with certain parties. Part III of this Article uses that framework to analyze the propriety of intermediary liability for several kinds of Internet-related misconduct. This Article is agnostic about the propriety of any particular regulatory scheme, recognizing the technological and contextual contingency of any specific proposal. Because any such scheme will impose costs on innocent end users, selecting a particular level of regulation should depend on policymakers 2 ̆ 7 view of the net social benefits of eradicating the misconduct, taking into account the intermediaries 2 ̆ 7 and innocent users 2 ̆ 7 compliance costs associated with the regulation. Still, the analysis of this Article suggests three points. First, the practicality of peer-to-peer distribution networks for the activity in question is an important consideration because those networks undermine the regulatory scheme 2 ̆ 7 s effectiveness, thereby making regulation less useful. Second, the highly concentrated market structure of Internet payment intermediaries makes reliance on payment intermediaries particularly effective as a regulatory strategy because of the difficulty illicit actors have in relocating to new payment vehicles. Third, with respect to security harms, such as viruses, spam, phishing, and hacking, this Article concludes that the addition of intermediary liability in those cases is less likely to be beneficial because market incentives appear to be causing intermediaries to undertake substantial efforts to solve these problems without the threat of liability...|$|E
