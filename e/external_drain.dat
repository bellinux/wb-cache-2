50|$|Endoscopic {{drainage}} {{is becoming}} the preferred method of draining pseudocysts because it is less invasive, does not require <b>external</b> <b>drain,</b> and has a large long-term success rate. Drainage is usually achieved with a transpapillary approach with ERCP. Sometimes a direct drainage across the stomach or duodenal wall is used instead. The transpapillary approach is used when the pseudocyst is in communication with the main pancreatic duct, and is also successful in patients with pancreatic duct disruption. Transgastric or transduodenal approaches are used when the pseudocyst is next to the gastro-duodenal wall. Endoscopic ultrasound is {{the most commonly used}} test to gather the needed information about the pseudocyst for this method.|$|E
50|$|Dadabhai Naoroji's work {{focused on}} the drain of wealth from India into England during colonial rule of British in India. One {{of the reasons that}} the Drain theory is {{attributed}} to Naoroji is his decision to estimate the net national profit of India, and by extension, the effect that colonisation has on the country. Through his work with economics, Naoroji sought to prove that Britannia was draining money out of India. Naoroji described 6 factors which resulted in the <b>external</b> <b>drain.</b> Firstly, India is governed by a foreign government. Secondly, India does not attract immigrants which bring labour and capital for economic growth. Thirdly, India pays for Britain's civil administrations and occupational army. Fourthly, India bears the burden of empire building in and out of its borders. Fifthly, opening the country to free trade was actually a way to exploit India by offering highly paid jobs to foreign personnel. Lastly, the principal income-earners would buy outside of India or leave with the money as they were mostly foreign personnel. In Naoroji's book 'Poverty' he estimated a 200-300 million pounds loss of India's revenue to Britain that is not returned. Naoroji described this as vampirism, with money being a metaphor for blood, which humanised India and attempted to show Britain's actions as monstrous in an attempt to garner sympathy for the nationalist movement.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBenign biliary strictures can be {{attributable}} to a large variety of causes, but are commonly iatrogenic after direct or vascular injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy and other biliary procedures. An increasing number of patients present with strictures of bilioenteric anastomoses after liver transplantation and radical surgery for hepatopancreaticobiliary cancer. Endoscopic access to the biliary tree may be difficult or impossible following pancreaticoduodenectomy, and in this context strictures are best approached percutaneously. In the past, strictures could only be managed with repeated balloon dilatations and/or long-term transhepatic catheter placement. This is not very satisfactory from a patient point of view. A long-term <b>external</b> <b>drain</b> is disfiguring and challenging to manage, and the patient has to undergo repeated, potentially very painful procedures.

The Federal Reserve System, newly authorized by Congress on December 23, 1913, remained on the sidelines {{during the summer of}} 1914, a victim of political and administrative delays. The absence of an operational central bank encouraged Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo to improvise the modern principle of aiming an independent weapon at each policy target. He employed a form of capital controls to deal with the external threat, shutting the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for more than four months to prevent Europeans from selling their American securities and demanding gold in return. And he invoked the emergency currency provisions of the Aldrich-Vreeland Act to deal with the internal threat, allowing banks to issue national bank notes, an important form of currency in pre-Federal Reserve days, without the normal requirement that the currency be secured by U.

40|$|Pancreatic pseudocysts are {{complications}} of acute or chronic pancreatitis. Initial diagnosis is accomplished most often by cross-sectional imaging. Endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration {{has become the}} preferred test to help distinguish pseudocyst from other cystic lesions of the pancreas. Most pseudocysts resolve spontaneously with supportive care. The size of the pseudocyst {{and the length of}} time the cyst has been present are poor predictors for the potential of pseudocyst resolution or complications, but in general, larger cysts {{are more likely to be}} symptomatic or cause complications. The main two indications for some type of invasive drainage procedure are persistent patient symptoms or the presence of complications (infection, gastric outlet or biliary obstruction, bleeding). Three different strategies for pancreatic pseudocysts drainage are available: endoscopic (transpapillary or transmural) drainage, percutaneous catheter drainage, or open surgery. To date, no prospective controlled studies have compared directly these approaches. As a result, the management varies based on local expertise, but in general, endoscopic drainage is becoming the preferred approach because it is less invasive than surgery, avoids the need for <b>external</b> <b>drain,</b> and has a high long-term success rate.

40|$|In der Neurochirurgie sind temporäre externe Ableitungen von Liquor cerebrospinalis häufige Eingriffe zur Behandlung von Liquorabflußstörungen. Besonders bei externen Ableitungen besteht eine unmittelbare Kommunikation zwischen Liquorraum und Hautoberfläche. Infektionen durch den Katheterweg sind häufige Komplikationen. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war es, die Wirksamkeit silberhaltiger EVD Katheter in vivo zu objektivieren. Dazu wurde die Infektionshäufigkeit konventioneller unbeschichteter EVD Katheter mit dem seit 2004 eingeführten antimikrobiellen silberhaltigen EVD Katheter verglichen. Mit einer statistischen Erfassung der Infektionsparameter aller Patienten die im Studienzeitraum eine externe Ventrikel-Drainage erhielten, wurde überprüft ob eine signifikante bzw. klinisch {{relevante}} Senkung der Infektionshäufigkeit vorlag. Hierzu wurden 231 Patienten in der Klinik für Neurochirurgie der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitätsklinik retrospektiv untersucht. Von 231 Patienten wurden nach Anwendung der Ausschlußkriterien 164 in die statistische Analyse aufgenommen. In der Studiengruppe mit silberhaltigen EVD Kathetern befanden sich 74 Patienten, 90 in der Kontrollgruppe. In beiden Patientenkollektiven bestanden keine statistisch relevanten Unterschiede bezüglich der klinischen Charakteristika. Besonders die Verteilung von Antibiotika und Glukokortikoiden war annähernd gleich in beiden Gruppen. In unserer Studie ist der Einsatz silberhaltiger EVD Katheter zur Behandlung chronischer oder akuter Liquorabflußstörungen hinsichtlich des primären Endpunktes positive Liquorkulturen, Katheterkolonisierungen oder erhöhten Zellzahlen im Liquor, mit einer statistisch signifikanten Abnahme der Häufigkeit von positiven Infektionsparametern gegenüber herkömmlichen EVD Kathetern assoziiert (18, 9 verglichen mit 33, 7 %; p= 0, 04 Chi-Quadrat-Test). Da externe Ventrikeldrainagen die Eintrittspforte für fakultativ pathogene Keime sein können, ist die Anwendung silberhaltiger EVD Katheter im Sinne einer lokalen Infektionsbarriere sinnvoll. Das Risiko katheterassoziierter Infektionen bei neurochirurgischen Patienten kann so gesenkt werden.

We compared the infection incidence of standard non-impregnated EVD catheters with silver-bearing <b>external</b> ventricular <b>drains,</b> first used in 2004. For assessing the primary outcome, we reviewed the patient charts of all patients who received an EVD catheter in the study period and analyzed if there was a statistically significant reduce of positive infection parameters. Two hundred and thirty-one patients were retrospectively reviewed at the Department of Neurosurgery at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University Medical Center. Of 231 patients 164 were included in the final analysis. Of these 164 patients, 90 were assigned to the control group and 74 to the study group with silver-bearing <b>external</b> ventricular <b>drains.</b> With respect to all clinical characteristics, there were no statistically significant differences in both patient collectives.

40|$|Argentina’s {{money and}} banking system was hit hard by the Great Depression. The banking sector was awash with bad assets that built up in the 1920 s. Gold {{convertibility}} was suspended in December 1929, even before the crisis seriously damaged the core economies. Commonly, these events are seen as being driven by external real shocks associated with the World Depression, despite the puzzle of the timing.

This internal explanation for the crisis involves no timing puzzle.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examine the}} {{monetary}} policy implications for emerging economies experiencing double drains, that is, credit crunches {{in both the}} global and their domestic financial markets. We construct a two-sector small open economy model with features such as original sin and dollar pricing, which are relevant to emerging markets. Our results imply that in deciding its policy stance the monetary authority should consider {{the extent to which}} international shocks are transmitted in the domestic credit markets. When international financial shocks hit the economy without spreading by contagion to domestic financial intermediation, the policy interest rate increases and the economy reduces its external debts and expands its net exports, while the contraction in real economic activities is mitigated by reallocation of input resources into the traded sector. However, if the international shock is contagious, and domestic financial markets hence dip into a credit crunch, the policy interest rate may be lowered to buffer the common negative impacts in both the traded and non-traded sectors, depending upon the degree of contagion. To minimize the cost of recession following an international financial shock, a passive stance for an <b>external</b> <b>drain</b> without contagion, and an active stance under a double drain with contagion are desirable...|$|E
40|$|Background: The use of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts {{has become}} {{ubiquitous}} in neurosurgery {{for the treatment}} of hydrocephalus. VP shunts work by creating a conduit for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to flow from the cerebral ventricles to the peritoneum and thus relieving pressure. Although typically safe, VP shunt complications are extremely common, occurring in up to 29 % of adult cases and approximately half of pediatric cases. These complications may require patients to undergo several revisions throughout their lifetime Purpose: We describe a man who developed scalp necrosis overlying his VP shunt. We also summarize the potential complications of VP shunts. We discuss the presentation and pathogenesis of scalp necrosis in these patients. Materials and methods: A PubMed search of the following terms was performed and relevant citations were assessed: ventriculoperitoneal shunt, VP shunt, shunt complications, scalp necrosis, skin necrosis, ventriculoperitoneal shunt induced scalp necrosis, ventriculoperitoneal shunt induced skin necrosis. Results: A 73 -year-old man developed VP shunt-induced scalp necrosis leading to loss of skin overlying the shunt valve. The patient was emergently referred to neurosurgery and admitted for revision of the shunt due to the significant risk for infection. The VP shunt was replaced with an <b>external</b> <b>drain</b> and a skin flap was used to repair the defect. Conclusion: VP shunts are devices that are frequently used for reducing intracranial pressure associated with hydrocephalus. The insertion of the shunt beneath the scalp sets the stage for potential pressure-induced scalp necrosis. The early recognition and diagnosis of VP shunt-induced scalp necrosis is essential to prevent infections and future complications...|$|E

Methods: From 2007 to 2011, we retrospectively studied our cohort of nine cases treated by endoscopic drainage and debridement of abdominal abscesses secondary to postbariatric surgery leaks performed via the transluminal or percutaneous route. Results: Three patients were treated by percutaneous endoscopic debridement of abscesses knowing that their leak was already closed by other endoscopic means and that their collection did not improve despite <b>external</b> <b>drain</b> in place. Six patients were treated by transluminal endoscopic drainage to perform necrosectomy as a first-line option or after failure of improvement after endoscopic treatment. The number of sessions required ranged from 1 to 3. Most severe patients had rapid improvement of their hemodynamic and respiratory conditions. In eight of the nine patients, we were able to close the fistula by stent, fistula plugs, or a macroclip. Resolution of collections was seen in seven out of nine patients, but two required further surgery. Conclusions: Endoscopic necrosectomy via the transluminal or percutaneous route is a feasible option in postbariatric surgery patients with necrotic abscesses not adequately managed by the classical combination of percutaneous drainage and stenting. Further wide-scale studies are needed to compare this non-surgical method with surgical necrosectomy in postbariatric surgery patients. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONGallstones are {{a common}} {{condition}} in bariatric patients after a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). The management of ductal stones is challenging due to the altered gastrointestinal anatomy. Various techniques {{have been reported to}} manage bile duct stones. PRESENTATION OF CASEWe present the successful percutaneous trans hepatic management of common bile duct stones after LRYGB. One year after a LRYGB for morbid obesity, a 59 -year-old female presented with acute cholecystitis. One month after laparoscopic cholecystectomy a 1 cm calculus was found within the distal CBD and patient underwent a percutaneous trans hepatic cholangiography under local anesthetic. This involved a right sided anterior segmental duct puncture. With the sphincter dilated to 10 mm, a balloon catheter was used to push the stone into the duodenum leaving an internal- <b>external</b> <b>drain.</b> Patient recovered completely at follow up. DISCUSSIONPatients with morbid obesity have a higher incidence of gallstones. After LRYGB, the altered anatomy does not allow the conventional endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for choledocholithiasis. Various techniques have been reported as means of managing bile duct stones in LRYGB patients. These include a double balloon enteroscope-assisted ERCP, laparoscopic transgastric ERCP, laparoscopic or open biliary surgery and interventional radiology. We report a non-surgical approach using percutaneous transhepatic technique under local anesthetic that resulted effective and could be applied more extensively. CONCLUSIONDue to the increase of global obesity, bariatric centers need to strategically plan resources such as interventional radiology in order to manage post LRYGB choledocholithiasis safely, efficiently and in a cost effective manner...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{a case of}} multiple catecholamine-secreting paragangliomas, with a hemorrhagic stroke as the main clinical manifestation.

Results: A 23 -year-old woman {{with a history of}} hypertension treated with orally administered medications presented to our emergency department because of sudden onset of hemiplegia of {{the left side of the}} body. A computed tomographic scan of the brain showed a right frontoparietal hematoma, and her blood pressure was 185 / 115 mm Hg. She was admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery, and an <b>external</b> <b>drain</b> was inserted to evacuate the hematoma. She was then referred to the Department of Clinical Sciences, where a search for possible secondary causes of hypertension was undertaken. Substantially elevated urinary levels of vanillylmandelic acid and metanephrines were found, and a pheochromocytoma was suspected. Abdominal computed tomographic scans revealed a large retroperitoneal mass (3. 6 by 4 cm) and similar smaller lesions in the right adrenal gland, between the aorta and the vena cava, and in the left paraaortic area. Iodine I 123 metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy showed high uptake in those same areas, consistent with the diagnosis of multiple catecholamine-secreting paragangliomas. After adequate control of the patient's hypertension was achieved with an α 1 -adrenergic receptor blocker, a Ca 2 + antagonist, and a β-adrenergic blocking agent, the tumors were excised in the Department of Surgery. The histopathologic findings confirmed the diagnosis of multiple paragangliomas. The genetic analysis demonstrated an exon 4 mutation in codon 109 (CAA>TAA,Gln>Stop) of the SDHD gene. Conclusion: Although cerebral hemorrhage is an unusual complication of pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas, early recognition of the characteristic symptoms of headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis in a patient with hypertension and prompt appropriate intervention can minimize the morbidity associated with such tumors and prevent a potentially fatal outcome. © 2008 AACE...|$|E
