50|$|The Government of Ontario {{created a}} network of colleges in 1967. Certain colleges, {{including}} Algonquin College, in Ottawa, and St. Lawrence College, in Cornwall, offer French-language programs. As early as the 1970s, the possibility of creating a 23rd - French-language - college in Ontario was put forth. In 1987, a working group was given the mandate, by the Government of Ontario, of considering the appropriateness of designating certain colleges as organisations offering services in French under Bill 8, the Ontario law on French-language services. The group concluded {{that the idea of}} creating a French college should be given priority over the college <b>designation</b> <b>plan.</b> The Minister of Colleges and Universities and Minister Responsible for Francophone Affairs agreed. In August 1988, the Ontario Cabinet approved, in principle, the creation of a French-language college with an exclusive mandate to deliver services in French. In 1989, the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities and the Department of the Secretary of State of Canada arrived at a cost-sharing agreement relating to the establishment of such a college in Eastern Ontario, a college bearing the official name « Collège d’arts appliqués et de technologie La Cité ».|$|E

5|$|Countries with {{decades of}} {{experience}} in comprehensive emergency medical systems have expertise that nations that are just beginning emergency medical programs lack. Thus, there exists considerable opportunity for the transfer of knowledge to assist newly founded programs. Such transfers may be made either from a distance or in person. For instance, the International Emergency Medicine Fellowship at the University of Toronto sent a three-person team to Cluj-Napoca, Romania, to promote the local development of emergency medicine. An assessment of the present status was performed that identified targets for improvement in physical plant organization and patient flow; staffing, staff education, equipment, medication and supplies; and infection control practices. Following these <b>designations,</b> <b>plans</b> regarding these areas were collaboratively drawn up and then implemented, partially through international exchange trips.|$|R

The government has explained this is to avoid frequent changes in route <b>designation,</b> with <b>plans</b> to update the designation to M1 over time as large sections of road are brought to motorway standard.|$|R

50|$|Whilst {{there is}} no {{legislative}} protection provided by a County Wildlife Site <b>designation,</b> <b>planning</b> permission for work that would have an injurious or adverse effect on sites is usually not granted. An affirmation {{of the importance of}} County Wildlife Sites - and indeed all other sites with a designation in the 'Local Sites' category - can be found in Circular 06/05: Biodiversity and Geological Conservation - Statutory Obligations and Their Impact Within The Planning System, and their role in helping the UK to meet national biodiversity objectives has been recognised in Planning Policy Statement Nine. The latter affirmation of their importance in biodiversity conservation resulted in a strengthening of the presumption against development on County Wildlife Sites following the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, which requires public bodies to 'have a regard for the conservation of biodiversity'. Despite any mandatory legal requirement to do so, positive management of County Wildlife Sites to enhance their value for wildlife is encouraged, and many local Wildlife Trusts and other conservation organisations provide resources to help site owners maximise their site's potential. For example, Suffolk Wildlife Trust offers 'advisory visits' to give guidance to site owners about the kind of conservation work they should be undertaking, whilst the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire regularly surveys and undertakes volunteer work on County Wildlife Sites.|$|R

Later, I-278 was planned to follow the Bruckner Expressway and the Sheridan Expressway to I-95 (with no route number for the Bruckner Expressway past there) before the current numbering took place by 1970, with I-895 designated onto the Sheridan Expressway.|$|R
