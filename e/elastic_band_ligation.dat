40|$|Background and objective. Endoscopic <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> is {{the main}} endo-scopic {{treatment}} for esophageal varices, but the main problem after en-doscopic treatment is variceal recurrence. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate and determine the esophageal varices recurrence rate and the time interval after endoscopic <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> and to investigate possible risk factors affecting recurrence. Material and methods. The retrospective analysis of endoscopic <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> procedures, performed in Vilnius University Hospital Santariskiu Clinics during the period 2006 – 2010, was made. 133 endoscopic <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> procedures were included in the study. Results. After endoscopic <b>band</b> <b>ligation,</b> esophageal varices recurred in 45 % of cases. The early recurrence of esophageal varices occurred in 46. 7 % of cases.

40|$|Bleeding from {{gastroesophageal}} varices is {{a frequent}} and often deadly complication of cirrhosis. The key factor in {{the natural history of}} esophageal varices is increased portal pressure, which in cirrhosis is due to the combination of increased hepatic vascular resistance and increased portal collateral blood flow. The maintenance and aggravation of this situation leads to the progressive dilation of the varices and thinning of the variceal wall, until the tension exerted by the variceal wall exceeds the elastic limit of the vessel, leading to variceal hemorrhage. Mortality from a variceal bleeding episode has decreased {{in the last two decades}} from 40 % to 20 % due to the implementation of effective treatments and improvement in the general medical care. Initial treatment should include adequate fluid resuscitation and transfusion to maintain the hematocrit at 25 % to 30 %, and prophylactic antibiotics (norfloxacin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid). It is currently recommended that a vasoactive drug be started at the time of admission. Drug therapy may be started during transferal to hospital by medical or paramedical personnel and maintained for up to five days to prevent early rebleeding. Terlipressin, a vasopressin derivative, is the preferred agent because of its safety profile and proven efficacy in improving survival. Somatostatin is as effective as terlipressin, but may require higher than the usually recommended dosage. Octreotide is effective in conjunction with endoscopic therapy, but is the second choice because it has not been shown to reduce mortality. Vasopressin may be used where terlipressin is not available, but should be given in combination with transdermal nitroglycerin. Endoscopic <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> is the recommended endoscopic treatment, but injection sclerotherapy is still employed in many centres for active variceal bleeding. Failures of medical therapy (drugs plus endoscopic therapy) should undergo a second course of endoscopic therapy before proceeding to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt or, in rare occasions, to portosystemic shunt surgery. Administration of recombinant activated factor VII may decrease the number of treatment failures among patients with advanced liver failure (Child-Pugh class B and C) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Endoscopic <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> is the {{treatment}} of choice for bleeding esophageal varices. However {{it is not clear}} if this procedure is associated with less early and late mortality than sclerotherapy. Aim: To assess rates of re-bleeding and mortality in cohorts of patients with bleeding esophageal varices treated with endos-copic injection or <b>band</b> <b>ligation.</b> Patients and Methods: Analysis of medical records and endoscopy reports of two cohorts of patients with bleeding esophageal varices, treated between 1990 and 2010. Of these, 54 patients were treated with sclerotherapy and 90 patients with <b>band</b> <b>ligation.</b> A third cohort of 116 patients that did not require endoscopic treatment, was included. The mean analyzed follow up period was 2. 5 years (range 1 - 16). Collection of data was retrospective for patients treated with sclerotherapy and prospective for patients treated with <b>band</b> <b>ligation.</b> Rates of re-bleeding and medium term mortality were assessed. Results: During the month ensuing the first endoscopic treatment, re-bleeding was recorded in 39 and 72 % of patients treated with <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> and sclerotherapy, respectively (p < 0. 01). The relative risk of bleeding after <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> was 0. 53 (95 % confidence limits 0. 390. 73).

30|$|In this {{reported}} case, the polyp immediately stopped bleeding following strangulation {{with the}} rubber band, and developed cyanotic change approximately 4  min later. It disappeared at follow-up endoscopy. The finding {{suggested that the}} ligated polyp would develop avascular necrosis following <b>banding</b> <b>ligation.</b> Therefore, our <b>banding</b> <b>ligation</b> could not only stop bleeding from polyp but also could bloodlessly transect the polyp. Since the bleeding polyp was not biopsied or resected following ligation, its nature was unknown. However, we have taken biopsies to assess the histology of some non-bleeding gastric polyps after <b>banding</b> <b>ligation</b> recently. No polyps bleeding occurred following biopsies because blood supply of those polyps was blocked by <b>banding</b> <b>ligation.</b> Therefore, it is possibly safe to take biopsy for bleeding polyps following <b>banding</b> <b>ligation</b> in patients with bleeding tendency.|$|R
40|$|Background: Endoscopic <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> (EBL) is an {{established}} maneuver for secondary prevention of variceal bleeding. However, recurrence of varices and postbanding ulcers are frequent problems. This {{is the first}} retrospective study that determined the the long-term re-bleeding rate in patients with esophageal varices who had done endoscopic Argon plasma photocoagulation (APC) after endoscopic <b>band</b> <b>ligation.</b> Aim: To determine the long-term re-bleeding rate of APC after endoscopic <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> versus endoscopic <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> alone for eradication of esophageal varices. Methods: Two hundred patients with cirrhosis, and had performed endoscopic <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> for eradication of varices were randomized to either argon plasma coagulation after <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> or observation. Endoscopy was performed every 3 months to check for recurrence of varices in both groups. If varices were unremarkable twice, patients were moved to every six months throughout the whole period of the study. Results: The 1 -year, 2 -year and 3 -years rebleeding rates {{in the group of}} APC were 1 %, 3 % and 3 %, respectively. While, rebleeding rates in the control group were 26 %, 29 % and 29 % at 1 -year, 2 -years and 3 -years respectively.

METHODS: Fifty-five patients with Grade III or small Grade IV hemorrhoids were randomly allocated to either rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> or stapled hemorrhoidectomy. Patient demographics and procedure-related details were recorded. Follow-up was at two weeks and two and six months to assess complications, symptom relief, incontinence scores, quality of life, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were randomly assigned to rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> and 30 to stapled hemorrhoidectomy. The groups were equally matched for age, gender, grade of piles, continence scores, and quality of life. Stapled hemorrhoidectomy was associated with increased pain and analgesia usage at both 2 -week and 2 -month follow-up (P < 0. 001). Rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> and stapled hemorrhoidectomy were equally effective in controlling symptomatic prolapse, but rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> was associated with an increased incidence of recurrent bleeding (P = 0. 002). There were 6 procedure-related complications in the stapled hemorrhoidectomy group compared with none in the rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> group (P = 0. 027). There was no {{difference between the two groups}} in terms of continence scores, patient satisfaction, or quality of life. CONCLUSION: Stapled hemorrhoidectomy is associated with more pain and minor morbidity than rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> in the treatment of Grade III and small Grade IV piles. However, for those patients who do not want the risk of further intervention procedures, stapled hemorrhoidectomy offers the better chance of a symptomatic cure...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} results of rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> and {{infrared}} photocoagulation {{for the treatment of}} hemorrhoidal disease through the analysis of the incidence of complications after each treatment and respective success rate. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with first, second or third degree hemorrhoidal disease were randomized to recieve treatment with either rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> (n= 23) or infrared photocoagulation (n= 25). Each patient was assessed at 1 week and 4 week intervals after treatment. We compared the incidence of complications and efficiency of each treatment modality and Qui-square, Fisher's Exact Test and Student's t Test were used to statistical analysis. RESULTS: Bleeding occured in eigth (34, 7 %) patients treated with rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> and in four (16, 0 %) after infrared photocoagulation (p= 0, 243). Thirteen (52, 0 %) patients felt pain during infrared photocoagulation and 9 (39, 1 %) after rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> (p= 0, 546). After rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation,</b> 14 (60, 8 %) required medication for pain relief. One patient (4, 0 %) required medication after infrared photocoagulation (p< 0, 001). Three (13, 0 %) patients treated with rubber band ligator and 1 (4, 0 %) treated with infrared photocoagulation had symptomatic mucosal ulcers. Perianal dermatitis occured in two (8, 0 %) patients treated with infrared photocoagulation and one patient (4, 3 %) was observed to have prolapsed thrombosed piles after rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation.</b> One month after treatment, 17 of 23 patients treated with rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> (73, 9 %) and 18 of 25 patients treated with infrared photocoagulation were asymptomatic.

40|$|BackgroundBoth {{drug therapy}} and <b>banding</b> <b>ligation</b> {{are widely used}} in the {{prevention}} of first variceal bleeding. This study compared the efficacy and safety of <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> vs. combination of p-blocker and nitrate for the prevention of first bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and high-risk esophageal varices. MethodsA total of 61 patients with cirrhosis with moderate or severe esophageal varices associated with red color signs but without history of variceal bleeding were randomized to <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> (30 patients) or treatment with nadolol plus isosorbide- 5 -mononitrate (ISMN) (31 patients). In the ligation group, multiband ligator with 4 <b>elastic</b> <b>bands</b> was applied during each session. Ligation was repeated at intervals of 4 weeks until variceal obliteration was achieved. In the combination group, the dose of nadolol was sufficient to reduce the pulse rate by 25 %. ISMN 1 tablet 20 mg qd or bid was administered. ResultsBoth groups were similar in baseline characteristics. In the ligation group, variceal obliteration was achieved in 24 patients (80 %), at a mean of 3. 2 ± 0. 9 ligation sessions and 11. 7 ± 3. 2 <b>elastic</b> <b>bands.</b> In the combination group, the mean daily doses of nadolol and ISMN administered were 40 ± 14 mg and 40 ± 12 mg, respectively. During a median follow-up of approximately 23 months, 5 patients (17 %) in the ligation group and 8 patients (26 %) in the combination group had upper-gastrointestinal bleeding (p = 0. 53). Esophageal variceal bleeding occurred in 3 patients (10 %) in the ligation group and 6 (19 %) in the combination group (p = 0. 42). By multivariate Cox analysis, presence of ascites was the only factor predictive of variceal bleeding. Minor complications were noted in 5 patients (17 %) in the ligation group and 3 (10 %) in the combination group (p = 0. 47). Eight patients in the ligation group and 6 in the combination group died (p = 0. 49). One (3 %) patient in the ligation group and 3 (10 %) in the combination group died of uncontrollable variceal bleeding. ConclusionOur preliminary results suggest that endoscopic variceal ligation is similar to the combination of nadolol plus ISMN with regard to effectiveness and safety {{in the prevention of}} first variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> is {{a common}} office {{procedure}} for hemorrhoids. Triple rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> in a single session {{has been shown to}} be a safe and economical way of treating hemorrhoids. However, postligation discomfort after triple rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> is not uncommon. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of local anesthetic injection to the banded hemorrhoidal tissue in reduction postligation discomfort. METHODS: Patients attending an outpatient clinic for symptomatic hemorrhoids suitable for triple rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> were randomly assigned to two groups. In the treatment group rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> was performed at three columns of hemorrhoids, and 1 to 2 ml of 2 percent lignocaine was injected into the banded hemorrhoidal tissue. In the control group triple rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> was preformed in a similar manner, but local anesthetic was not given. Patients were followed up by telephone at the second week and in the clinic after six weeks. RESULTS: From April to August 1996, 101 patients entered the trial and were treated with triple rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation.</b> Sixty-two patients were randomly assigned to the local anesthetic injection group and 39 to the control group. Overall good to excellent results occurred in 89 percent of patients, and there was no difference between the two groups. Postligation pain occurred in 26 and 20 percent of patients in the treatment and control groups, respectively (P > 0. 05). Postligation tenesmus occurred in 32 and 41 percent of patients in the treatment and control groups, respectively (P > 0. 05). No patients suffered from septic complications or bleeding that required transfusion. CONCLUSION: Triple rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> in a single session is a safe, economical, and effective way of treating symptomatic hemorrhoids. Postligation pain and tenesmus occurred in 24 and 37 percent, respectively. Discomfort was usually tolerable. Local anesthetic injection to the banded hemorrhoidal tissue did not help to reduce postligation discomfort. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

In the present randomized study, a comparison is made between infrared coagulation and rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> in terms of effectiveness and discomfort. One hundred patients with second degree bleeding piles were randomized prospectively to either rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> (N = 54) or infrared coagulation (N = 46). Parameters measured included postoperative discomfort and pain, time to return to work, relief in incidence of bleeding, and recurrence rate. The mean age was 38 years (range 19 - 68 years). The mean duration of disease was 17. 5 months (range 12 to 34 months). The number of male patients was double that of females. Postoperative pain {{during the first week}} was more intense in the <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> group (2 - 5 vs 0 - 3 on a visual analogue scale).

As the infrared coagulation can be conveniently repeated in case of recurrence, it should be considered as the first line of therapy in early hemorrhoids...|$|R

40|$|Background: Treatment of {{hemorrhoids}} in Nigeria {{is usually}} {{done by the}} traditional open method that requires hospital admission; anesthesia and is associated with high morbidity. Rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> is a suitable alternative to open hemorrhoidectomy and {{has the potential to}} reduce the need for hospital admission. Patients and Methods: This was a prospective analysis of consecutive patients presenting with hemorrhoids that were suitable for surgical treatment to the Jos University Teaching Hospital and the Federal Medical Centre Gombe from January 2008 to December 2010 (24 months). Results: A total of 232 rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligations</b> were performed on 40 patients whose ages ranged from 20 to 54 years {{with a mean age of}} 37. 1 ± 12. 2 years. There were 24 males and 16 females (M:F:: 2 : 3). Thirty-nine patients (97. 5 %) were cured of their symptoms following the procedure, and 1 patient (2. 5 %) had severe pain as complication of the treatment. Another patient had recurrence that was treated by repeat rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation.</b> Conclusion: We conclude that rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> is a safe and reliable way for outpatient treatment of hemorrhoids in Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|Rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> {{is a well}} {{established}} treatment of internal second-degree hemorrhoids. Up to now, the long-term results (> 5 years) of this method have not been assessed. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the long-term success rate of rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> in patients with a first episode of second-degree hemorrhoids not responding to medical treatment (local cream with laxative). A total of 92 patients who were treated between 1979 and 1997 for second-degree hemorrhoids responded to a questionnaire. The need for complementary conservative (sclerotherapy, cryotherapy or rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation)</b> or surgical treatment was considered indicative of relapse. The collected data were analyzed according to the Kaplan-Meier method. The average follow-up time was 5. 6 years. There were 21 patients who suffered a relapse. The probability of successful treatment was 0. 77 (range: 0. 67 - 0. 88) after 5 years and 0. 68 (range: 0. 5 - 0. 86) after 10. 6 years. We conclude that rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> represent an efficient long-term treatment for second-degree hemorrhoids. Approximately two thirds of the patients are cured after 5 years and more than a half after 10 years...|$|R
30|$|Figures  8 and 9 show {{snapshots}} {{of the assembly}} task using the <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> and the o-ring, respectively. It can be verified that the robot successfully inserted both the <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> and the o-ring. Here it must be emphasized that although the human demonstration was made using only the <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> (which is more flexible than the silicon-made o-ring), the same extracted key points were useful to insert both objects. However, as the o-ring’s stiffness is {{higher than that of}} the <b>elastic</b> <b>band,</b> {{it can be seen that}} the ending position/orientation of the robot slightly differs from that of the <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> (Figs.  8 g, 9 g). Nonetheless the o-ring was inserted on the cylinder as can be observed in Fig.  9 h.|$|R
30|$|Our <b>banding</b> <b>ligation</b> method can be {{employed}} for both bleeding sessile or pedunculated gastric polyps. Sessile polyps are often difficult to be captured by traditional electrocautery polypectomy. Although endoscopic mucosal resection with cap-fitted panendoscopy may capture the lesions by suction, bleeding is a possible serious complication following the procedure (Inoue et al. 1993), especially in patients with bleeding tendency. In this situation, <b>banding</b> <b>ligation</b> of the lesions is possibly a good choice because {{it is easy to}} aspirate the polyps by suction, and the avoidance of resection procedure might decrease the risk of bleeding. In this reported case, 3  ml of distilled water was injected into the base of the bleeding polyp to lift the lesion off the muscle layer. Additionally, submucosal injection before <b>banding</b> <b>ligation</b> could compress the vessels in the submucosal layer and was possibly beneficial for preventing bleeding.|$|R
40|$|Objective This study aims at {{investigating}} {{the outcome of}} rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> of piles in an outpatient setting. Methods After taking an informed consent, 46 patients, 89 % of them were males, mean age 52. 5 years, with uncomplicated grade II-III piles {{were involved in the}} study. Rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> of piles was made by Pentax iScan gastroscope. The patients were followed up regularly to record any complication. Results Most of the patients (91. 3 %) need one session of treatment, 3 patients need 2 sessions, no more than 2 bands were used. Additionally, a relatively low percentage of patients recorded certain complication of the operation, on follow up. Conclusion High success rate, cost eﬀectiveness and the simplicity of rubber <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> as an outpatient procedure promote its use as the frst line of treatment for frst, second and early third degree hemorrhoids...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Severe {{separation}} of the pubic symphysis is a rare delivery complication. Facing this pathology, we decided to study a new <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> device. METHOD: To evaluate the <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> device, clinical (pain-rated) and imaging (magnetic resonance imaging and radiography) evaluations with and without the device were performed. The <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> device is a European Conformity-certified medical device, which is made of neoprene straps, that reduces the mobility of the pelvis {{and the use of}} the internal rotator muscles. EXPERIENCE: Once the <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> device was in place, on postpartum day 1, radiography showed a decrease of the pubic width from 41 to 12 mm. Furthermore, pain decreased from 10 of 10 to 2 of 10 in 2 days, allowing the patient to ambulate and avoid surgery. After 1 month, the pubic width (6 mm) and anatomy were recovered but minor pain was still present with hip rotatory movements. The <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> device was worn 24 hours a day from postpartum days 1 - 90 and 12 hours a day from postpartum days 90 to 150; afterward, the patient returned to normal life without the <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> device. CONCLUSION: Use of an <b>elastic</b> <b>band</b> device was associated with a reduction of the pubic width and pain associated after obstetric pubic symphysis separation...|$|R
50|$|The {{results from}} the only two {{randomized}} trials comparing <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> vs cyanoacrylate suggests that endoscopic injection of cyanoacrylate, known as gastric variceal obliteration or GVO is superior to <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> in preventing rebleeding rates. Cyanoacrylate, a common component in 'super glue' is often mixed 1:1 with lipiodol to prevent polymerization in the endoscopy delivery optics, and to show on radiographic imaging. GVO is usually performed in specialized therapeutic endoscopy centers. Complications include sepsis, embolization of glue, and obstruction from polymerization in the lumen of the stomach.|$|R
40|$|Background: Use of {{endoscopic}} therapies for esophageal varices {{has resulted}} in increased prevalence of fundal varices and severe portal hypertensive gastropathy. This study was meant to compare the effect of <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> and sclerotherapy on development of fundal varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Methods: Patients with esophageal varices presenting in the endoscopy unit of Shiakh Zayed Hospital, {{with at least one}} previous endoscopy were included. Patient‘s past record was reviewed for findings and type of treatment given for varices during first endoscopy, number of endoscopies till date, number of esophageal varices <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> (EVBL) or sclerotherapy sessions. All patients underwent upper GI endoscopy and findings were recorded. Type of treatment patient rendered during first endoscopy either EVBL or sclerotherapy was correlated to the presence of fundal varices and severity of portal hypertensive gastropathy observed on present endoscopy, using Chi square test (χ 2). Results: Eighty one patients were included. Mean age of patients was 48. 70 + 12. 63. Esophageal varices <b>band</b> <b>ligation</b> was carried out during first endoscopy in 49 (60. 5 %) patients and sclerotherapy in 31 (38. 2 %) patients. On fresh endoscopy, fundal varices were seen in 25 (30. 8 %) patients. Severe portal hypertensive gastropathy was found in 26 (32. 1 %) and mild in 54 (66. 7 %) patients. Severity of portal hypertensive gastropathy and presence of fundal varices in recent endoscopy was significantly more in patients with EVBL in first endoscopy. Conclusion: <b>Band</b> <b>ligation</b> of esophageal varices is associated with more frequent development of fundal varices and worsening of portal hypertensive gastropathy compared to sclerotherapy.
