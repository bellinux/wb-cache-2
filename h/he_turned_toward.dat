25|$|Fred Schultz had {{previously}} been exonerated in the fatal shooting of a Glendale, Wisconsin, police officer on July 23, 1975. The Glendale officer, George Robert Sassan, had arrested a subject in a bar while off-duty. Milwaukee police officers, including Schultz, responded to the call in suburban Glendale (outside their jurisdiction), reportedly mistook Sassan for a suspect and shot him to death when <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> them, holding a gun. Schultz and his partner were cleared by the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office in the shooting.|$|E
25|$|Henri Clément Serveau, {{also known}} as Clément-Serveau (29 June 1886 – 8 July 1972), was a French painter, designer, {{engraver}} and illustrator. Clément-Serveau produced works in a realist manner early on, but soon {{became interested in the}} new movements. He was influenced by his friend Louis Marcoussis and experimented with Cubism, utilising geometric patterns to give the illusion of form and space. Later in his career <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> abstraction with a post-cubist stance. He designed banknotes for the Banque de France and produced large murals and participated in numerous French and international exhibitions.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} Cardinal von Rodt on June 29 with the {{instructions}} of the Imperial Court was {{the turning point}} of the conclave. He initially tried to achieve {{an agreement with the}} French, but having failed, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> the Zelanti faction. Direct negotiations between von Rodt and Spinelli resulted in the proposal for election of the Venetian Cardinal Carlo Rezzonico, bishop of Padua. On July 6 in the morning the bishop of Padua received eight votes in the ballot and four additional in the accessus. Portocarrero, Albani and the French cardinals initially opposed, but finally agreed for him. After the consultations of French Cardinals with ambassador Laon it became clear that Rezzonico would be elected to the Papacy.|$|E

25|$|Wanting {{to become}} a doctor, Tutu secured {{admission}} to study medicine at the University of the Witwatersrand; however, his parents could not afford the tuition fees.

He had also taken five correspondence courses provided by the University of South Africa (UNISA), graduating in the same class as future Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe.|$|E
