Angiotensin I (Ang I) (0. 15 /ig/kg i. v.) elevated mean arterial blood pressure by 18 ± 1 mm Hg in the renal experimental group and 19 ± 1 mm Hg in the femoral experimental group; it decreased renal blood flow by 35 ± 3 % but increased femoral blood flow by 31 ± 8 %. All these effects were blocked by intravenous administration of captopril (2 mg/kg bolus injection plus 1 mg/kg/hr). Captopril also lowered mean arterial pressure by 17 ± 3 and 16 ± 2 mm Hg in the renal and femoral experimental groups, respectively, and it increased renal blood flow by 32 ± 10 % but reduced femoral blood flow by 21 ± 4 %. As a result, renal vascular resistance was decreased by 36 ± 5 %, but femoral vascular resistance remained unchanged. After captopril, plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) levels were decreased and Ang I levels increased in the two groups.

40|$|Abstract Background Previously, {{we found}} that β-galactoside α 2, 6 -sialyltransferase (ST 6 Gal I), an enzyme that adds sialic acids to N-linked {{oligosaccharides}} of glycoproteins and is frequently overexpressed in cancer cells, is up-regulated by ionizing radiation (IR) and cleaved to a form possessing catalytic activity {{comparable to that of}} the Golgi-localized enzyme. Moreover, this soluble form is secreted into the culture media. Induction of ST 6 Gal I significantly increased the migration of colon cancer cells via sialylation of integrin β 1. Here, we further investigated the mechanisms underlying ST 6 Gal I cleavage, solubilization and release from cells, and addressed its functions, focusing primarily on cancer cell migration. Methods We performed immunoblotting and lectin affinity assay to analyze the expression of ST 6 Gal I and level of sialylated integrin β 1. After ionizing radiation, migration of cells was measured by in vitro migration assay. α 2, 6 sialylation level of cell surface was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell culture media were concentrated and then analyzed for soluble ST 6 Gal I levels using an α 2, 6 sialyltransferase sandwich ELISA. Result We found that ST 6 Gal <b>I</b> <b>was</b> cleaved by BACE 1 (β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme), which was specifically overexpressed in response to IR. The soluble form of ST 6 Gal I, which also has sialyltransferase enzymatic activity, was cleaved from the Golgi membrane and then released into the culture media. Both non-cleaved and cleaved forms of ST 6 Gal I significantly increased colon cancer cell migration in a sialylation-dependent manner. The pro-migratory effect of the non-cleaved form of ST 6 Gal <b>I</b> <b>was</b> dependent on integrin β 1 sialylation, whereas that of the cleaved form of ST 6 Gal <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not,</b> <b>suggesting</b> that other intracellular sialylated molecules apart from cell surface molecules such as integrin β 1 might be involved in mediating the pro-migratory effects of the soluble form of ST 6 Gal I. Moreover, production of soluble form ST 6 Gal I by BACE 1 inhibited integrin β 1 sialylation and migration by Golgi-anchored form of ST 6 Gal I. Conclusions Our results suggest that soluble ST 6 Gal I, possibly in cooperation with the Golgi-bound form, may participate in cancer progression and metastasis prior to being secreted from cancer cells. </p...|$|R

5000|$|In an {{internet}} text entitled [...] "Death penalty for global warming deniers? An objective argument...a conservative conclusion" [...] dated 25 October 2012, Parncutt, after declaring his fundamental {{opposition to the}} death penalty in all cases including mass murderers such as Anders Behring Breivik, proposed restricting the death penalty to individuals who cause more than one million deaths, and claimed that influential [...] "global warming deniers" [...] could fall into that category if they slow progress toward reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and thereby cause the deaths of millions of future people. The text included a link to desmogblog's controversial list of climate skeptics. Parncutt suggested that a panel of scientists should decide whether a given individual had caused more than one million deaths. Convicts should also have the chance to reprieve to life imprisonment, if they withdraw, publicly repent and commit themselves to [...] "participate significantly and positively over a long period in programs to reduce the effects of global warming (from jail) - using much the same means that were previously used to spread the message of denial".

40|$|The {{title of}} my paper is {{different}} from the title given to this vol-ume—“The Search for Global Monetary Order”—reflecting a slight quibble about the dynamics of replacing an old order with something different. I prefer “evolving ” rather than “search for, ” because I think the former suggests human action while the latter may suggest human design. 1 The danger of engaging in a search for a new global monetary order is that we may think that we have found it and stop the search. Certainly, from a Hayekian perspective, it would be a “fatal conceit” (Hayek 1989 a) to think that a group of economic architects could dream up a monetary structure to house the global financial system for the new millennium. And, the idea of a new Bretton Woods suggests a “pretense of knowledge ” (Hayek 1989 b) that I do not share. I hasten to add, though, that <b>I</b> will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>suggesting</b> that “doing nothing ” is the correct response to what seems to be emerging in monetary matters. Rather, we should be guided in our thinking about the framework in which things will evolve by the prescription of my former professor Karl Brunner, who once said that the state should be “an umpire in a positive sum game, ” not the “operator of a negative sum game ” (Brunner 1985 : 7). I contend that the same should be true of any international organization that is created by the various nation states.

Possibly I ask no more than a moderation of rhetoric. Revolutions have always fed upon inflated rhetoric.

40|$|This thesis {{traces the}} afterlife of the Romance of the Rose in fourteenth-century England. Whether it was closely imitated or only faintly recalled, I {{argue that the}} Rose {{exercised}} its influence on fourteenth-century English literature in two principal ways. Firstly, {{in the development of}} a self-reflexive focus on how meaning is produced and transmitted. Secondly, in a concern with how far the authorâs intentions can be recovered from a work, and to what extent the author must claim some responsibility for the meaning of a text after its release into the world of readers. In the Rose, many of these issues are presented through the lens of a disordered erotic desire, and questions of licit and illicit textual and sexual pleasures loom large in the later responses. My investigation focuses on four English writers: William Langland, John Gower, the Gawain -Poet, and Geoffrey Chaucer. In my final chapter I suggest that the Rose ceased to be a generative force in English literature in the fifteenth century, and I try to offer some explanations as to why. 	 In examining the influence of the Rose in England <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> trying to <b>suggest</b> a linear transmission of cultural dominance, but rather a complex and plural process of interaction that expands to include texts that both antedate and post-date the Rose â especially Neoplatonic allegories and Ovid, on the one hand, and, on the other, Deguileville and Machaut. The individual English writers <b>I</b> look at <b>are</b> <b>not</b> seen as having a single and stable attitude towards the Rose; instead, I argue, the Rose emerges as a way of thinking about the interaction between texts, how meaning is produced, and how authorial ownership is claimed or refused. 	 Using not only literary evidence but also detailed archival research into the manuscript circulation of the Rose, I question the usefulness of 'English' and 'French' as critical categories for the study of late-medieval literature, and attempt to show that, for a certain kind of literary activity, the Rose occupied a central position in England: not a stable foundation of cultural authority, but a realm of self-questioning subversion and instability. </p...|$|R
40|$|Man {{by nature}} is a gregarious being both {{in his body}} and mind. In other words, he likes {{to live in a}} community. This {{explains}} the hackneyed adage that no man is an island. Instead he is a victim of social inevitability as he must as a matter of necessity willy nilly live in a society with other human beings rather than in isolation. For any society to survive or even exist, it must inescapably anchor itself on law, which in turn governs the behavior of members of the society in question, as well as their relations, their rights and obligations. Law thus is a mandatory cause of conduct accepted by members of a given society as established by the legitimate authority of that society. When we talk about law and society, we are undoubtedly referring to a group of individuals bound together under a political organization, whose very existence is dependent {{on the quality of the}} law which has enabled that association to come into existence in the first place. Members of the society normally have an inherent interest in the preservation of both their individual welfares and that of the association. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> trying to <b>suggest</b> that members of a society would robotically adhere to the laws in place. Far from that, the reverse is true. Just as the faces of all men are different, so are the members that constitute any human society. They each share varying behaviors ranging anywhere from submissiveness to delinquency. The main relevance of the law is to direct the society to behave in a particular way or face corresponding sanctions. The purpose of this paper therefore is to examine how human behavior is determined by law or relative to law, vis-à-vis the society, crime and punishment. It recognizes the enormous influence of any legal system on the behaviors of its citizenry, and asserts that law can through direct or indirect enforcement mechanisms either widen or contract the horizon of opportunities within which individuals can satisfy their sundry preferences. Inherent to the activities of any community, society or organization is a potential for order and disorder. When we are attempting to control something, we must acutely be conscious of what resists us. No society in the world however beautifully designed can function in an atmosphere of perfect harmony. With every human society constituted of people with different behavioral patterns, there is bound to be an element of disharmony at various facets of societal intercourse, which in turn necessitates law to act as specific social barometer. This consists of bringing about “the desired social conduct of men through threat of a measure of coercion which is to be applied in case of contrary conduct. ” Hans Kelsen has asserted that a state is defined as a political organization only because the “political” element consists in nothing but “the element of coercion. ” Another writer has succinctly observed that for there to be an organization or a society, there should be interaction, for there to be interactions there should be encounters, and for there to be encounters there should be disorder. In other words, order and disorder are effectively part and parcel of human society...|$|R
