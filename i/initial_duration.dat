The results of qualitative analysis of the evolution of three-dimensional wave packets with the quasi-soliton field distribution are confirmed by the computer simulation. The simulation proves that the considered regime of compression of high-power laser pulses with <b>initial</b> <b>durations</b> of about ten optical cycles is stable relative to filamentation instability due to the influence of the nonlinear dispersion.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{study the}} nonlinear compression of a 20 -mJ, 1030 -nm picosecond chirped pulse from the thin-disk amplifier in a krypton gas-filled hollow-core fiber. The chirp from the thin-disk amplifier system has little {{influence on the}} initial pulse, however, it shows {{an effect on the}} nonlinear compression in hollow-core fiber. We use a large diameter hollow waveguide to restrict undesirable nonlinear effects such as ionization; on the other hand, we employ suitable gas pressure and fiber length to promise enough spectral broadening; with 600 -μm, 6 -bar (1 bar = 105 Pa), 1. 8 -m hollow fiber, we obtain 31. 5 -fs pulse. Moreover, we calculate and discuss the optimal fiber lengths and gas pressures with different <b>initial</b> <b>durations</b> induced by different grating compression angles for reaching a given bandwidth.

A wide set of experiments on SRA amplification in the Compton regime [1] has been performed at MPQ in recent years. This regime is attained when the bounce frequency of electrons in the potential well of counterpropagating beams becomes {{larger than the}} electron plasma frequency, ωB 2 = 4 aseedapumpω 0 2 >ωpe 2, and plasma electrons serve as independent emitters. The most effective amplification could be expected with the <b>initial</b> seed <b>duration</b> close to the half of the bounce period: τseed∼π/ωB∼(IpumpIseed) - 1 / 4 ω 0 - 1. In the recent experiments, the <b>initial</b> seed <b>duration</b> was always larger than π/ωB.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{influences}} of inherent optical properties (IOP) of seawater and parameters of laser pulse on characteristic of laser pulse after underwater propagation. Besides, achievable transmission distances under different conditions are simulated. Regard single pulse energy, <b>initial</b> <b>duration</b> and far field divergence {{angle of the}} transmitted laser pulse as inputs, and energy, temporal and spatial distribution on receive plane as outputs, underwater optical channel can {{be treated as a}} linear time invariant (LTI) system. The response of the underwater optical channel to the laser pulse with unit energy, far-field divergence angle of 0 and duration of 0 is impulse response. For different inputs, corresponding outputs are the convolution of the inputs and impulse response. Firstly, by using Monte Carlo method, the impulse responses of the underwater optical channel after transmission under a series of seawater performance conditions are studied. Through convolution, the influences of <b>initial</b> <b>duration</b> and far field divergence angle on temporal and spatial distribution are simulated. Simulation results show that influences of <b>initial</b> <b>duration</b> and far-field divergence angle of transmitted laser pulse are not obvious. And, the effects of IOP of seawater, such as absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient and asymmetry factor, on energy value, temporal and spatial distribution on receive plane are analyzed and compared. At last, according to proposed reasonable receive condition and detection threshold, achievable transmission distance of different parameters of laser pulse and different IOP of seawater are simulated. Simulation results show that, achievable transmission distance depends mostly on IOP of seawater, less on parameters of laser pulse. Simulation results provide a certain reference for underwater optical communication...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} a study with 12 infants at each of 2, 4, and 6 months of age which {{examines}} the effects on infant visual pursuit of varying the target linear velocity (m/s) and the target angular velocity (deg/s) independently.

Interruptions in tracking become more frequent as linear velocity increases but less frequent as angular velocity increases. The mean duration of later tracking intervals is diminished relative to the duration of earlier tracking intervals in 4 - and 6 -month-olds, but not in the 2 -month-olds. Differences in angular velocity may account for the conflicting reports of disruptions in object permanence studies relying on a visual tracking paradigm...|$|R

Duration was observed at phone level. The results indicate that cases of lengthening, shortening, and absence of any effect all occur. Those are determined by the speech sounds phonemic identity, and the results were similar in both cor-pora. For instance /s / and /r / are length-ened while /j / and /m / are shortened.

30|$|The {{effect of}} ppp on the optimal {{migration}} duration {{at the time}} of arrival is large; for instance, according to the first specification, a 10 percent increase in ppp lowers the optimal migration duration of a 20 -year-old arriver by 1.8 years. Since the predicted migration duration for an average unmarried 20 -year-old arriver in 1984 (at average ppp and wage ratio values for 1984) is 9.0 years, a 10 percent increase in ppp reduces the optimal migration duration of this immigrant by 20 percent. The effect of ppp is even larger for an unmarried 30 -year-old arriver in 1984 : according to the first specification, a 10 percent increase in ppp reduces his optimal migration duration by 2.4 years, which implies a 38 percent fall from an <b>initial</b> <b>duration</b> of 6.3 years.|$|E

40|$|Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) {{divide into}} two classes 1 : 'long', which {{typically}} have <b>initial</b> <b>durations</b> of T 90 > 2 s, and 'short', with durations of T 90 < 2 s (where T 90 {{is the time}} to detect 90 % of the observed fluence). Long bursts, which on average have softer gamma-ray spectra 2, are known to be associated with stellar core-collapse events—in some cases simultaneously producing powerful type Ic supernovae 3, 4, 5. In contrast, the origin of short bursts has remained mysterious until recently. A subsecond intense 'spike' of gamma-rays during a giant flare from the Galactic soft gamma-ray repeater, SGR 1806 – 20, reopened an old debate over whether some short GRBs could be similar events seen in galaxies out to approx 70 Mpc (refs 6 – 10; redshift z approximately 0. 016). Shortly after that, localizations of a few short GRBs (with optical afterglows detected in two cases 11, 12) have shown an apparent association with a variety of host galaxies at moderate redshifts 11, 12, 13, 14. Here we report a correlation between the locations of previously observed short bursts and the positions of galaxies in the local Universe, indicating that between 10 and 25 per cent of short GRBs originate at low redshifts (z < 0. 025) ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{implementation}} of a high-performance Mandarin TTS system is presented. The system is composed of four main parts: text analysis (TA), prosodic information generation (PIG), a waveform table of 411 base-syllables (WT), and PSOLA-based waveform synthesis (PSOLA). In TA, statistical model based method is first employed to automatically tag the input text to obtain the word sequence and the associated part-of-speech (POS) sequence. A lexicon containing about 80000 words is used in the tagging process. Then the corresponding base-syllable sequence is found and used in WT to form the basic waveform sequence of the base-syllables. Some linguistic features used in PIG are also extracted in TA. In PIG, a four-layer recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed to generate some prosodic information including the pitch contour, energy level, <b>initial</b> <b>duration</b> and final duration of syllables as well as the inter-syllable pause duration.

This study compared {{the effects of a}} trauma-focused and a non-trauma-focused psychotherapy on sleep, to investigate whether 1) sleep improves with psychotherapy for PTSD; 2) the degree of sleep improvement depends on whether the intervention is trauma or nontrauma-focused; 3) the memory-updating procedure in cognitive therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD) is associated with sleep improvements; 4) <b>initial</b> sleep <b>duration</b> affects PTSD treatment outcome; and 5) which symptom changes are associated with sleep duration improvements.
