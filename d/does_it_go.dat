Only after the organization rethinks what it should be doing, <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> on to decide how best to do it.|$|E
2500|$|Jimi Hendrix of The Jimi Hendrix Experience {{played an}} impromptu version of [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] {{to open his}} set at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970. Just before walking onto the stage, he can be seen (on the DVD) and heard to ask [...] "How <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> again?" [...] in {{reference}} to said UK national anthem. He may {{have been able to}} simply hear it mimicked by voice and then perform it, though the same melody was (and is) widely known in the United States to the lyrics [...] "My country, 'tis of thee". Hendrix gave the same sort of distortion and improvisation of [...] "God Save the Queen", as he had done with [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] at the Woodstock Festival, 1969.|$|E

60|$|During the {{skirmish}} not {{a single}} musket had been discharged. The first snatched by Jarl had missed fire, and ere he could seize another, it was close quarters with him, and no gestures to spare. His harpoon was his all. And truly, {{there is nothing like}} steel in a fray. It comes and it goes with a will, and is never a-weary. Your sword is your life, and that of your foe; to keep or to take as it happens. Closer home <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> than a rammer; and fighting with steel is a play without ever an interlude. There are points more deadly than bullets; and stocks packed full of subtle tubes, whence comes an impulse more reliable than powder.|$|E
