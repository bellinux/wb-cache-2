25|$|Scorsese {{attended}} New York University's Tisch School of the Arts (B.A., English, 1964; M.F.A., film, 1966) {{making the}} short films What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a Place Like This? (1963) and It's Not <b>Just</b> <b>You,</b> Murray! (1964). His most famous {{short of the}} period is the darkly comic The Big Shave (1967), which features Peter Bernuth. The film is an indictment of America's involvement in Vietnam, suggested by its alternative title Viet '67. Scorsese has mentioned on several occasions that he was greatly inspired in his early days at New York University by his Armenian American film professor Haig P. Manoogian.|$|E
25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's <b>just,</b> <b>you</b> know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E

I just liked that as a concept.|$|E

500|$|Eisenberg {{played the}} supervillain Lex Luthor in , which was {{released}} in March 2016, to mixed reviews. Eisenberg's performance in particular was criticized [...] by comic book fans and film reviewers, later earning him the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor. He would defend himself by saying he attempted to [...] "make these people real and relatable and interesting and engaging, not <b>just,</b> <b>you</b> know, a surface bad person." ...|$|E
500|$|The Washington Post concurred in this assessment, {{describing}} {{the premise of}} the show as [...] "Hey, what happens if you take the characters from Seinfeld and give them eating disorders?" [...] While crediting Starved for [...] "a few inventive laughs," [...] the language and sexuality of the show are described as [...] "exceptionally coarse" [...] and [...] "outrageous for cable television, even later at night." [...] Worse than these issues, the Post felt that Schaeffer neglected to develop the characters in favor of coming up with contrived situations for them. [...] "his failure to build understanding into the show dooms it to emptiness, with a sour aftertaste. As if you had <b>just,</b> <b>you</b> know, hurled." ...|$|E
500|$|The creators {{used the}} {{ambiguity}} of [...] "coming out of the closet", having Tom Cruise literally refusing {{to come out of}} Stan's closet, in a parody of rumors involving Cruise's sexuality. Cruise has a documented history of litigation against others involving rumors as to his sexuality, and some speculated whether Cruise could sue South Park. Entertainment Weekly asked in December 2005 whether South Park was [...] "cruisin' for a bruisin'" [...] and wondered [...] "how that sort of Cruise-bashing is going to go over with Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone's new bosses: Paramount Pictures just inked the dudes to a three-year deal. Other people with Paramount deals? Oh, <b>just,</b> <b>you</b> know, Tom Cruise. Should be one hell of a studio Christmas party".|$|E

500|$|In the season-ending RAC Rally in Great Britain, Mouton {{continued}} her good performances by running third at half distance, despite having been uncomfortable about competing in a rally where pacenotes and practice are not allowed. However, her Quattro later incurred gearbox problems and she retired from fifth place after sliding {{off the road}} into a snow-filled ditch. Mouton would later state: [...] "For me, rallying is England. No pacenotes – <b>just</b> <b>you</b> in the car having to do the fastest time. This, to me, is rallying. OK, {{it was not easy}} for me because I did not have experience there of the British championship, but it is really rallying. I like it very much." [...] Mouton finished the season in eighth place in the drivers' championship, while Audi was fifth in the manufacturers' standings.|$|E
500|$|In 1912 Stamper {{began writing}} songs for the Ziegfeld Follies of 1913, {{contributing}} <b>Just</b> <b>You</b> and I and The Moon, Without You and Everybody Sometime Must Love Somebody. He is credited as [...] "additional music" [...] for the Follies of 1914 and 1915, but {{he wrote the}} majority of the music for the Follies of 1916. and was on an equal billing with Louis A. Hirsch, Jerome Kern, and Irving Berlin. The music of the Follies of 1917 was written by Stamper and Raymond Hubbell and he was described as [...] "an old hand" [...] for his work with Louis A. Hirsch by the Follies of 1918. In addition to his 1918 Follies work, he wrote all the music for Ziegfeld Midnight Frolic with Gene Buck, a series that also had editions in 1919, 1920 and 1921.|$|E
500|$|Although Milian was a {{songwriter}} since her teenagers years, she only felt real growth during the production sessions when Dre told her, [...] "there are no rules". Previously, Milian would write songs that followed rules, {{where she would}} have a hook, a verse, and another verse with similar sound and melody. For So Amazin, she wrote with a [...] "no rules theory", which was her biggest obstacle while recording the album. She said, [...] "It was <b>just,</b> <b>you</b> know what? I can change up the melody I can do different things. Sometimes I might get stuck but wait half an hour and it'll come to you and end up being hot. So that's probably my biggest obstacle, just stepping away from doing the usual that I know and stepping into something new. Once I got past all that, it was just easy. With flying colors, I started writing all the records." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Just</b> like <b>You</b> is {{the third}} studio album by Delta blues artist Keb' Mo', {{released}} in 1996. It features guest artists Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt, both on the title track [...] "Just Like You". Unlike the first album, <b>Just</b> Like <b>You</b> features a more blues-pop to blues-rock feel and more of its tracks feature a full band. In 1997, <b>Just</b> Like <b>You</b> won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album.|$|R
500|$|Work on the game's storyline {{and levels}} began in January 1993. Jones {{recalled}} that starting from cliché plots they moved towards [...] "very interesting and unique but {{extremely difficult to}} understand stories". One of the more complicated stories cast the player {{as one of a}} group of Roman soldiers who discovered a mountain spring that extended their lives. Every seven years one soldier would be picked to descend into the caves and bring back more water. If the leader died, a new one would be selected to undertake the journey to ensure their survival. [...] "It was a very interesting plot since your quest wasn't necessarily virtuous, it didn't involve doing good things or saving the world," [...] Jones said. [...] "It was <b>just</b> <b>you</b> were chosen, more or less against your will, to become the next leader of this freak cult of immortals." [...] The final plot occupied a middle ground between the simple and complex stories, because the developers did not want to force players to become deeply involved in the story.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{a reality}} series {{originated}} when Doherty and Iswarienko were interested in documenting {{the weeks leading up}} to their wedding in a filming and production style similar to [...] and Deadliest Catch. Doherty had previously worked on reality television when she hosted Scare Tactics and Breaking Up with Shannen Doherty and participated on the tenth season of Dancing with the Stars. She called the project her agreement with Iswarienko to [...] "chronicle this time in our lives and let future brides and future grooms know that [...] not <b>just</b> <b>you</b> and that goes through the stress". According to Doherty, it was a way to celebrate her third marriage: [...] "Can you bring all of those qualities to reality TV? Can you be that brutally honest, that completely raw, but with the quality of those two shows where you do use different cameras and you do want it to look spectacular?" [...] Doherty planned to develop the idea with her own production company, originally partnering with an unidentified television network. However, the series was picked up by WE tv when Doherty thought that the previous network was making the material too sensational. Miller said that he approved the series after seeing its pitch, and he found Doherty an appealing person to watch on reality television.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the women}} were being {{processed}} for imprisonment, Jones instructed them: [...] "You sing the whole night long. You can spell one another if you get tired and hoarse.

2500|$|Nash's {{screenplay}} changed {{virtually all}} of the sung recitative to spoken dialogue, as in the 1942 stage revival.

In the film the line is spoken. The recitatives themselves did not have to really be rewritten, because they do not rhyme, while the words in all the songs do.|$|E

[...] "La La La (Brazil 2014)" [...] is {{included}} on the Latin American and Spanish deluxe edition of the album; it is a re-worked version of the song [...] "Dare (La La La)" [...] with new lyrics for the 2014 World Cup.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, West's image {{underwent}} a major metamorphosis; {{the woman who}} had once performed outfitted in conservative gingham dresses, and had originally refused to record Kris Kristofferson's [...] "Help Me Make It Through the Night" [...] because it was [...] "too sexy", began appearing in spandex-sequined Bob Mackie designs. (She had relented in late 1970 and recorded [...] "Help Me Make It Through the Night" [...] on the album Careless Hands, which was released in 1971.) As the sexual revolution peaked, so did West's career. Under United Artists, West's material changed from traditional country to up-tempo and slow-tempo Adult Contemporary-styled music. In 1977, West released her first album under United Artists, When It's <b>Just</b> <b>You</b> and Me. The title track peaked at No.19 on the country charts.|$|E
