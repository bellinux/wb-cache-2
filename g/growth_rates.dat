5|$|Because of the {{possible}} single-egg clutch and the bird's large size, it has been proposed that the dodo was K-selected, meaning that it produced a low number of altricial offspring, which required parental care until they matured. Some evidence, including the large size {{and the fact that}} tropical and frugivorous birds have slower <b>growth</b> <b>rates,</b> indicates that the bird may have had a protracted development period. The fact that no juvenile dodos have been found in the Mare aux Songes swamp may indicate that they produced little offspring, that they matured rapidly, that the breeding grounds were far away from the swamp, or that the risk of miring was seasonal.|$|E
40|$|Monte Carlo {{method is}} used to capture the {{evolution}} of spherulites and shish-kebabs and to predict the crystallization kinetics in isothermal polymer crystallization. Effects of nucleation density and <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> of spherulites, nucleation density, and length <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> of shish-kebabs, respectively, on crystallization are investigated. Results show that nucleation densities of both spherulites and shish-kebabs strongly affect crystallization rate as well as morphology. An increase in nucleation density of either spherulites or shish-kebabs leads to a quicker crystallization rate and a smaller average spherulite size. It is also shown that nucleation density of shish-kebabs has a stronger impact on crystallization <b>rate.</b> <b>Growth</b> <b>rate</b> of spherulites and length <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> of shish-kebabs also have significant effect on crystallization rate and morphology.

5|$|<b>Growth</b> <b>rates</b> of pterosaurs {{once they}} hatched varied across {{different}} groups. In more primitive, long-tailed pterosaurs ("rhamphorhynchoids"), such as Rhamphorhynchus, the average growth rate {{during the first}} year of life was 130% to 173%, slightly faster than the growth rate of alligators. Growth in these species slowed after sexual maturity, and it would have taken more than three years for Rhamphorhynchus to attain maximum size. In contrast, the more advanced, large pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as Pteranodon, grew to adult size within the first year of life. Additionally, pterodactyloids had determinate growth, meaning that the animals reached a fixed maximum adult size and stopped growing.|$|E
