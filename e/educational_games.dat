25|$|Serious {{games are}} games that are {{designed}} primarily to convey information or a learning experience to the player. Some serious games may even fail to qualify as a video game {{in the traditional sense}} of the term. Educational software does not typically fall under this category (e.g., touch typing tutors, language learning programs, etc.) and the primary distinction would appear {{to be based on the}} title's primary goal as well as target age demographics. As with the other categories, this description is more of a guideline than a rule. Serious games are games generally made for reasons beyond simple entertainment and as with the core and casual games may include works from any given genre, although some such as exercise games, <b>educational</b> <b>games,</b> or propaganda games may have a higher representation in this group due to their subject matter. These games are typically designed to be played by professionals as part of a specific job or for skill set improvement. They can also be created to convey social-political awareness on a specific subject.|$|E
25|$|Anger {{management}} programs with a cognitive-behavioral basis have been modified {{for children and}} adolescents. There are three common types of CBT aimed at the youth. First, life skills development (communication, empathy, assertiveness, etc.) uses modeling to teach appropriate reactions to anger. Second, effective education focuses on identifying the feelings of anger and relaxation. Finally, problem solving conveys a view {{of cause and effect}} for situations as an alternative to anger. A wide range of methods can be used to convey these three components, with both age and severity being important factors. For younger children, involvement can be increased by presenting anger management in more of a fun format with <b>educational</b> <b>games</b> and activities being available. For adolescents, group therapy can be an effective form given the resemblance to the individual's natural social environment. The severity of expressed anger issues often relates to the intensity of the subsequent anger management program. A few violent outbursts in a classroom setting could result in several sessions with the school's counselor. However, more severe juvenile delinquency could result in court mandated anger management sessions in a juvenile correctional facility.|$|E

After suffering significant losses, Mattel sold The Learning Company in 2000 at a loss to Gores Technology Group, a privately held international acquisition and management firm, for a share of what the firm could sell the assets for. In 2001, edutainment development company Riverdeep Group acquired the education assets of The Learning Company from Gores Technology Group for $40 million in stock, while assuming $20 million in liabilities as inter-company debt. By 2002, Encore Software, a privately held publisher of home entertainment and education, had acquired the exclusive publishing rights for the Madeline properties and re-released the software under its own brand name. In that same year, distribution company Navarre Corporation purchased Encore for $7 million in cash while acquiring $2.75 million in debt.

Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is the current owner of the Madeline video game license while either Navarre Corporation holds the publishing rights or they reverted to HMH after the games went out of print.
