Although combining data sources may result in nearly complete coverage of the target population, the outcomes are not error free. Estimating the effect of nonsampling errors on the accuracy of mixed-source statistics is crucial for decision making, but it is not straightforward.

We combine <b>an</b> <b>audit</b> <b>sample,</b> the dynamics in the business register, and expert knowledge to estimate a transition matrix of classification-error probabilities. Bias and variance of the turnover estimates caused by classification errors are estimated by a bootstrap resampling approach. In addition, we study the extent to which manual selective editing at micro level can improve the accuracy. Our analyses reveal which industries do not meet preset quality criteria. Surprisingly, more selective editing can result in less accurate estimates for specific industries, and a fixed allocation of editing effort over industries is more effective than an allocation in proportion with the accuracy and population size of each industry. We discuss how to develop a practical method that can be implemented in production to estimate the accuracy of register-based estimates...|$|R

The overall {{purpose of the study}} is to explore the current extent at which statistical and nonstatistical sampling approaches are utilized by independent auditors during auditing practices. Moreover, the study also seeks to achieve two additional purposes; the first is to find out whether auditors utilize different <b>sampling</b> techniques when <b>auditing</b> SME´s (Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise) and big companies and the second is to find out some common selection methods that are used by auditors for selecting statistical or nonstatistical <b>audit</b> <b>samples</b> during <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> practices.   METHOD: The population that has been investigated consists of professional auditors residing in Umeå-Sweden. Data for the study was collected by conducting semi-structured interviews and convenient sampling; a non-probability sampling technique was used for respondent’s selection. An interviewed guide was sent to respondents in advance with the objective of giving them the opportunity to have both mental and psychological preparations prior to each interview scheduled date. The semi-structured interview technique was adopted because it was a suitable approach to extract valuable information and in-depth explanations from auditors about the current extent of the use of statistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> and nonstatistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> during <b>auditing</b> practices. Ultimately, the selected respondents actively participated in which they thoroughly expressed their views and experiences about <b>audit</b> <b>sampling,</b> statistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling,</b> and nonstatistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling.</b>   RESULTS: Statistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> and nonstatistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> were found to be used most often by auditors when auditing the financial statements of big companies compare to SME´s where nonstatistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> is most often used. Therefore, both statistical and nonstatistical samplings are in dominant utilization by auditors in Sweden. <b>Audit</b> <b>samples</b> are selected through random selection method and systematic selection methods when using statistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> and for nonstatistical audit sampling; items are selected by the use of professional judgment. However, auditors in Sweden are more inclined with the use of random selection method for statistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> and their professional judgment for nonstatistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling.</b> The main reasons for the auditors using both statistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> and nonstatistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> are to minimize risks and to guarantee high quality audit.

SETTING [...] One district general hospital. PATIENTS [...] 76 adult patients with acute asthma: 38 admitted with a relevant primary diagnosis between April 1988 and March 1989 and a further 38 admitted through the {{accident and emergency department}} between April 1989 and March 1990. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Conformity with recognised standards for assessment and management of acute asthma before and after the audit and by chest physicians and general physicians. RESULTS [...] Age and sex did not differ significantly between the different groups of patients. Overall, deviations from the guidelines occurred in recording measures of severity of asthma, emergency treatment with beta 2 agonists (60 / 76, 79 %) and steroids (43 / 76, 57 %), and prescription of antibiotics in accordance with at least one criterion of the guidelines (29 / 45, 64 %).

40|$|ISO 9001 {{demands of}} (software) {{organizations}} that a rigorous demonstration of their software processes be implemented {{and a set}} of guidelines followed at various levels of abstraction. What these organizations need to show, in other words, is that their software processes have been designed and implemented in a way that allows for a level of configuration and operation that complies with ISO 9001 requirements. For software organizations needing ISO 9001 certification, it is important that they establish a software process life cycle that can manage the requirements imposed by this certification standard. However, software organizations that develop their software products using the agile software processes, such as Extreme Programming (agile-XP), face a number of challenges in their effort to demonstrate that their process activities conform to ISO 9001 requirements, major ones being: product construction, traceability, and measurement. Agile software organizations must provide evidence of ISO 9001 conformity, and they need to develop their own procedures, tools, and methodologies to do so. As yet, there is no consensus on how to audit the agile software organization to ensure that their software processes have been designed and implemented in conformity with ISO 9001 requirements. Moreover, it is challenging to ensure that such lightweight documentation methodologies meet these requirements for certification purposes. The motivation of this research is to help software organizations that use agile software processes in their effort to meet the ISO 9001 certification requirements. This research project is also aimed at helping IS auditors extract auditing evidence that demonstrates conformity to the ISO 9001 requirements that must be met by agile software organizations. Extreme programming (agile-XP) has been selected for improvement as a candidate agile process. This selection was based on the literature indicating a higher adoption of agile-XP over other agile software processes. The goal of this research project is to improve the ability of the agile-XP process to meet the auditing requirements of ISO 9001. The goal of the research also focuses on helping agile software organizations in their effort to become ISO 9001 certified. The main objective of this research project is to <b>design</b> <b>an</b> <b>auditing</b> model that covers the measurement and traceability requirements of ISO 9001. The auditing model should provide IS auditors with auditing evidence that the software projects developed with the agile-XP process have fulfilled the requirements of ISO 9001. The objective also proposes several sub processes to enhance the early planning activities of agile-XP according to ISO 9001 requirements. To achieve these objectives, the main phases of the research methodology are: Investigation of the capability of agile-XP to achieve the requirements of ISO 9001 software process certification; modification of the early phases of agile-XP (i. e. release planning phase) using CMMI-DEV; and <b>design</b> of <b>an</b> <b>auditing</b> model for ISO 9001 traceability and measurement requirements. The main outcome of this research study, which is <b>an</b> <b>auditing</b> model that is aligned with the principles of agile-XP and focuses on ISO 9001 traceability and measurement requirements to provide the IS auditors with a methodological approach for the auditing process. The auditing model has been assessed based on case studies selected from the literature...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{noise and}} health studies seldom address the {{positive}} effect of environments with high acoustic quality. Sound quality, in turn, {{is influenced by}} a large number of factors, including the spatial–physical characteristics of a neighborhood. In general, these characteristics cannot be retrieved from existing databases. In this article, we describe the <b>design</b> of <b>an</b> <b>audit</b> instrument and demonstrate its value for gathering information about these characteristics of neighborhoods. The audit instrument used was derived from research in other fields than environmental health. The instrument was tested in 33 neighborhoods in the Dutch cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Arnhem. In these neighborhoods, more or less homogeneous subareas were identified that were subject of the audit. The results show that the audit approach is suitable to gather neighborhood data that are relevant for the sound quality of neighborhoods. Together with survey data, they provide information that could further the field of soundscape and health. Several suggestions for improvement of the audit instrument were made...|$|R
