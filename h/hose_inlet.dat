50|$|By 1960, the VKK-3 was {{replaced}} by the vastly different VKK-4. Also used in high performance aircraft such as the Su-9 and MiG-21, it had several distinct differences to its predecessor. The front zipper {{was replaced}} by a zipper on each shoulder for entry of the suit, with more extensive lacing replacing the former suit's front zipper. While still incorporating the VKK-3's 'H' hose setup, the VKK-4 had two hose inlets instead of the single <b>hose</b> <b>inlet.</b>|$|E
40|$|This senior project report {{lays out}} the {{production}} of drip hydraulics software composed in Microsoft Excel and backed by coding in Visual Basic for Applications. The program performs 2 main functions useful {{in the design of}} irrigation systems. The first is based on performing single hose computations under three different circumstances. It can solve for the average emitter flow rate given the <b>hose</b> <b>inlet</b> pressure, the inlet pressure given the average emitter flow rate, and can model hose pressures and flow rates while flushing. The second function is to place a manifold in the hydraulically optimum location on a slope. One advantage of this software over its former DOS version is the designer has access to all of the data used in the calculations including the entire Bernoulli tables that model flows and pressures at every emitter in the field. As this could also be a point of weakness, great effort was put into making the software simple to follow and displaying pertinent information in intuitive locations...|$|E
50|$|Booster {{pumps are}} usually piston or plunger type compressors. A single-acting, {{single-stage}} booster is the simplest configuration, and comprises a cylinder, designed {{to withstand the}} operating pressures, with a piston which is driven back and forth inside the cylinder. The cylinder head is fitted with supply and discharge ports, to which the supply and discharge hoses or pipes are connected, with a non-return valve on each, constraining flow in one direction from supply to discharge. When the booster is inactive, and the piston is stationary, gas will flow from the <b>inlet</b> <b>hose,</b> through the <b>inlet</b> valve into {{the space between the}} cylinder head and the piston. If the pressure in the outlet hose is lower, it will then flow out and to whatever the outlet hose is connected to. This flow will stop when the pressure is equalised, taking valve opening pressures into account.|$|R
40|$|NASA’s {{future plans}} for {{long-term}} spaceflight {{will require a}} constant food and water supply. Consequently, a system must be developed to recover water {{in order to make}} long-term spaceflight feasible. Prior to collection, urine is pretreated in order to prevent clogging of the small diameter collection tubes by biofilm formation and solids precipitation. The current method of pretreatment is a string of tablets placed in the <b>inlet</b> <b>hose</b> of the collection system. The urine dissolves the chemical tablets comprised of sulfuric acid and oxone before being transported to the wastewater collection area through small diameter tubes. These tubes can easily become clogged if the urine begins to precipitate or biofilms form. The current pretreatment chemicals, Sulfuric Acid and Oxone, are toxic and would prevent the recovery of water from urine for reuse aboard the spacecraft. As par to of the Space Engineering Institute (SEI), the Urine pretreatment team’s objective is to address the urine pretreatment toxicity issue. SEI supports interdisciplinary multi-level applied research projects for undergraduate engineering students to promote retention and better prepare students for their engineering careers. The objective of this research is to identify a nontoxic urine pretreatment agent that prevents solids precipitation and bacterial growth. T...|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{is being}} developed for sampling water for signs of microbial life in an ocean hydrothermal vent {{at a depth of}} as much as 6. 5 km. Heretofore, evidence of microbial life in deep-sea hydrothermal vents has been elusive and difficult to validate. Because of the extreme conditions in these environments (high pressures and temperatures often in excess of 300 C), deep-sea hydrothermal- vent samplers must be robust. Because of the presumed low density of biomass of these environments, samplers must be capable of collecting water samples of significant volume. It is also essential to prevent contamination of samples by microbes entrained from surrounding waters. Prior {{to the development of the}} present apparatus, no sampling device was capable of satisfying these requirements. The apparatus (see figure) includes an intake equipped with a temperature probe, plus several other temperature probes located away from the intake. The readings from the temperature probes are utilized in conjunction with readings from flowmeters to determine the position of the intake relative to the hydrothermal plume and, thereby, to position the intake to sample directly from the plume. Because it is necessary to collect large samples of water in order to obtain sufficient microbial biomass but it is not practical to retain all the water from the samples, four filter arrays are used to concentrate the microbial biomass (which is assumed to consist of particles larger than 0. 2 m) into smaller volumes. The apparatus can collect multiple samples per dive and is designed to process a total volume of 10 L of vent fluid, of which most passes through the filters, leaving a total possibly-microbe-containing sample volume of 200 mL remaining in filters. A rigid titanium nose at the intake is used for cooling the sample water before it enters a flexible <b>inlet</b> <b>hose</b> connected to a pump. As the water passes through the titanium nose, it must be cooled to a temperature that is above a mineral-precipitation temperature of 100 C but below the upper working temperature (230 C) of switching valves and tubes in the apparatus. The sample water then passes into a manifold tube, from whence the switching valves can direct the water through either a bypass tube or any one of the filter arrays, without contamination from a previous sample. Each filter array consists of series of filters having pore sizes decreasing in the direction of flow: 90 -, 60 -, 15 -, and 7 -micron prefilters and a large-surface-area 0. 2 -micron collection filter. All the filter taps are located between the intake and the bypass tube so that each time the bypass tube is used, the entire manifold tube is flushed as well...|$|R
