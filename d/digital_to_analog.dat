25|$|Temporal {{aliasing}} is a {{major concern}} in the sampling of video and audio signals. Music, for instance, may contain high-frequency components that are inaudible to humans. If a piece of music is sampled at 32000 samples per second (Hz), any frequency components above 16000 Hz (the Nyquist frequency for this sampling rate) will cause aliasing when the music is reproduced by a <b>digital</b> <b>to</b> <b>analog</b> converter (DAC). To prevent this, an anti-aliasing filter is used to remove components above the Nyquist frequency prior to sampling.|$|E
25|$|All DRM to date can {{therefore}} be bypassed by recording this signal and digitally storing and distributing it in a non DRM limited form, by anyone who has the technical means of recording the analog stream. Furthermore, the analog hole cannot be overcome without the additional protection of externally imposed restrictions, such as legal regulations, because the vulnerability is inherent to all analog means of transmission. However, the conversion from <b>digital</b> <b>to</b> <b>analog</b> and back is likely to force a loss of quality, particularly when using lossy digital formats. HDCP {{is an attempt to}} plug the analog hole, although it is largely ineffective.|$|E

Unused space on the motherboard was removed; the CPU was relocated, and the battery housing was expanded.|$|E

Band member Phil Lesh released experimental space music recording Seastones with computer music pioneer Ned Lagin in 1975, one of the first albums to be issued in the innovative but commercially unsuccessful format SQ-Quadwith.
