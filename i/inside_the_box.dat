Abe uses this box to travel six hours into his own past—as part of this process, Original-Abe sits incommunicado in a hotel room, {{so as not to}} interact or interfere with the outside world, after which Original-Abe enters the box, waits <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> for six hours (thus going back in time six hours), and becomes Future-Abe, who travels across town, explains the proceedings to Aaron, and brings Aaron back to the self-storage facility housing the box. At the end of the overlap-timespan, Original-Abe enters the box and ceases to exist.|$|E
5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of split screens, which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>box.</b> It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.|$|E
5|$|Drogba came on as a {{substitute}} for Anelka against Manchester United in the Community Shield, but could not help prevent Chelsea from succumbing to a 3–1 loss. However, he started the Premier League season in fine form, continuing from where he left off {{on the last day of}} the previous campaign as he scored a hat-trick against West Bromwich Albion in a 6–0 victory. In Chelsea's next game against Wigan Athletic at the DW Stadium, Drogba made three assists in another 6–0 win. Drogba also played the next game at home against Stoke City where he played the whole 90 minutes and scored his fourth Premier League goal of the season when he kicked home a penalty after Nicolas Anelka was brought down by Thomas Sørensen <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>box.</b> On 7 November 2010, Drogba missed the first half of Chelsea's 2–0 defeat by Liverpool. It was later revealed that he had been suffering from malaria for at least a month. He had first complained of feeling unwell before the October 2010 international break but the illness was only diagnosed on 8 November 2010. Having diagnosed the problem, Chelsea insisted that he would make a full recovery within days.|$|E

25|$|In 1802, William Cruickshank {{designed}} the first electric battery capable of mass production.

These plates were placed {{into a long}} rectangular wooden box which was sealed with cement. Grooves <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> held the metal plates in position. The box was then filled with an electrolyte of brine, or watered down acid.

25|$|Cabaye {{wrote his}} name into Newcastle United {{folklore}} by scoring {{the winner in}} the 1–0 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford on 7 December 2013, their first victory there for 41 years. His fourth goal of the season arrived on 21 December when he scored the first goal in a comprehensive 3–0 victory at Crystal Palace, before again scoring in the 5–1 win against Stoke City the next week. In his final game, on 18 January 2014, Cabaye bagged a brace in a 3–1 win over fellow Premier League side West Ham United, equalling his 2012–13 goal tally in just half a season. His first goal was a shot from just <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> after good skill and with his last kick for Newcastle, Cabaye scored a free-kick {{from the edge of}} the box.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 2011, van Persie scored {{his first}} {{goal of the}} season in a 3–0 away win over Birmingham City. On 15 January, he added two more goals to his tally in a {{comfortable}} 3–0 win over West Ham. This made him only the fourth Dutchman to reach 50 goals in England's top division. Van Persie scored his first career hat-trick in a 3–0 win over Wigan Athletic on 22 January and two goals against Newcastle United in a 4–4 draw on 5 February. Continuing his fine form, he hit a brace the following week against Wolverhampton Wanderers scoring both Arsenal goals in a 2–0 win including a volley from <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>box.</b> The ten goals he scored between 1 January and 12 February set a new Premier League record for most goals scored in the first two months of a calendar year.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{the same}} box design {{was used to}} package {{different}} kits. For example, the 1961 Pickup kit box illustrated both the Ford and the Chevy, but the kit <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> was identified by a label affixed to the outside. In the early 1960s AMT's 3-in-1 Trophy kit instructions usually came with short biographies of popular customizers of the day such as Bill Cushenberry, Dean Jeffries, Alex Kraus, Gene Winfield, the Alexander Brothers and of course George Barris, {{most of whom were}} employed by AMT. Gene Winfield even closed his California shop to work with AMT (Cawthon 2002). Also, instruction sheets for some kits had a section with customizing hints by George Barris exclusively. An extreme example was the 1957 Ford Thunderbird kit. The instructions included five pages devoted to “stylizing”, a practice of adding parts by using body putty and sanding which went beyond ordinary customizing. Included in the '57 T-Bird kit were additional street rod, drag and Bonneville styling ideas all suggested by George Barris.|$|E

25|$|Om a Tuesday {{night at}} Memphis, the Cougars {{initially}} looked like their offense was finally starting to click when Solawa {{drove down the}} field and crossed a pass into the box, where Jambga slotted it past the Tigers' keeper for the season's first SIUE score {{from the field and}} the 1–0 lead in the 12th minute. After falling behind, the hosts from the American Athletic Conference shifted into a higher attack gear. Memphis took shot after shot, nut the Cougar defense and keeper Dal Santo held firm well into the second half. Although Memphis committed more fouls and was given four second-half yellow cards, it was SIUE who was called for a foul <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>box,</b> setting up the penalty kick that tied the game in the 77th minute. Having never won at Memphis, the Cougars would have settled for a draw, but, as the clock wound down, the Tigers took a shot off a crossing pass, and the SIUE block was directed past Dal Santo with only nine seconds left in the game.|$|E
25|$|Cal State Northridge's {{visit to}} SIUE {{was moved to}} an hour earlier {{to try to avoid}} weather, but {{lightning}} delayed things almost to the original start time. The Matadors fouled a Cougar hard <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> in the 5th minute. setting up Ledbetter's second PK goal of the season for the early Cougar lead. Twenty minutes into the game, there was another stoppage for lightning and another 1/2 hour delay. After the lightning delays, a shortened halftime was planned, until the power went out for the entire SIUE campus. Once the second half started, the game played out to the end. CSUN pressed and pressed the attack, out-shooting the Cougars 13 to 8, but the home team's defense turned away attack after attack, and Dal Santo made 6 saves in addition to preventing own-goals by corralling balls headed by Cougars that went off the post and the crossbar. After trying every two-man pairing from among six players for a two-striker offense, Coach Sanchez returned the Cougars to a single-striker setup; although they still did not score, the offense was more of a threat as SIUE picked up the first win of the season.|$|E
25|$|Bengaluru {{started their}} first ever AFC Cup {{campaign}} against Maldivian side Maziya S on 28 February 2015. After a goalless first half, Sunil Chhetri gave Bengaluru FC {{the lead in}} the 67th minute. When Bengaluru seemed be heading for the victory {{towards the end of the}} match, Maziya were awarded a penalty in 88th minute, which they converted. However, Bengaluru scored a last gasp winner in stoppage time when Shankar Sampingiraj headed the ball into the net from Eugeneson Lyngdoh's cross. In their second game against Persipura Jayapura, Bengaluru started without their top players, Sunil Chhetri, Robin Singh, Shankar Sampingiraj, Keegan Pereira, Eugeneson Lyngdoh and Siam Hanghal, due to a schedule conflict with World Cup qualification. Persipura took a decisive lead of 2–0 in the first half against a lackluster Bengaluru FC side. Persipura extended their lead in the second half, though in the closing minutes C.K. Vineeth pulled one back for Bengaluru as they lost 3–1. Still missing their top players, Bengaluru played the next game at home against Warriors FC. Bengaluru got a penalty in the first half, when C.K. Vineeth was brought down <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>box.</b> English mid-fielder Josh Walker stepped up to take the penalty and scored his first ever goal for the team.|$|E

25|$|Other {{evidence}} {{supported this}} theory. During {{the investigation of}} Mrs. Muncey's murder, the doctor who performed the autopsy passed the vials to two local law enforcement officers who transported it to the FBI, where further testing occurred. The blood was contained in four vials, evidently with neither preservative nor a proper seal. The vials, in turn, were stored in a foam box, but nothing indicates the box was kept cool. Rather, in violation of proper procedure, the foam box was packed in the same cardboard box as other evidence, including House's pants and other clothing. The cardboard box was carried in the officers' car, and transported while they made the 10-hour journey from Tennessee to the FBI lab. Blood vials in hot conditions (such as a car trunk in the summer) can blow open. By the time the blood reached the FBI it had hemolyzed, or spoiled, due to heat exposure. By the time the blood passed from the FBI to a defense expert, roughly a vial and a half were empty, though the agent who had analyzed it testified he used at most a quarter of one vial. Blood, moreover, {{was found to have}} seeped onto one corner of the foam box and onto packing gauze <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> below the vials.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} cylinder boxes have a plain {{brown paper}} exterior, sometimes rubber-stamped {{with the company}} name. By the late 1890s, record companies usually pasted a generic printed label around {{the outside of the}} box, sometimes with a penciled catalog number but no other indication of the identity of the recording inside. A slip of paper stating the title and performer was placed <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> with the cylinder. At first this information was hand-written or typed on each slip, but printed versions became more common once cylinders were sold in large enough quantities to justify the printing set-up cost. The recording itself usually began with a spoken announcement of the title and performer and also the name of the record company. On a typical Edison record slip from 1903, the consumer is invited to cut off a coupon with the printed information and paste it onto the lid of the box. Alternatively, a circular area within the coupon could be cut out and pasted onto the end of a spindle for that cylinder in one of the specially built cases and cabinets made for storing cylinder records. Only a minority of cylinder record customers purchased such storage units, however. Slightly later, the record number was stamped on the lid, then later still a printed label with the title and artist information was factory-applied to the lid. Shortly after the start of the 20th century, an abbreviated version of this information was impressed into or printed on one edge of the cylinder itself.|$|E
25|$|Following their {{successful}} 2–1 aggregate {{victory over}} Real Madrid, Lyon were {{inserted into the}} quarter-finals. The draw was conducted on 19 March and Lyon were drawn to face Ligue 1 rivals and fellow French club Bordeaux. On 30 March 2010, Lyon faced Bordeaux at the Stade de Gerland in {{the first leg of}} the competition. Lyon got on the scoreboard early through a goal through Lisandro López following a blunder from Bordeaux defender Michaël Ciani, which allowed Mathieu Bodmer to recover the ball <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> and find López in front of goal. Undeterred, Bordeaux quickly leveled with a vital away goal from striker Marouane Chamakh after great service from Yoann Gourcuff. In the 32nd minute, Lyon again took the lead with Michel Bastos scoring following another Bordeaux error, this time from Benoît Trémoulinas who misplayed a Lyon cross, which allowed the ball to land at the feet of Bastos who proceeded to blast a shot past goalkeeper Cédric Carrasso. Midway through the second half, Laurent Blanc's team rallied with the Brazilian Wendel drilling a shot on goal, which went by Hugo Lloris, but went directly off the post. Minutes later, Lyon were awarded a penalty courtesy of a Matthieu Chalmé handball. The penalty was converted by Lisandro to give Lyon a 3–1 lead and the Argentine was later carded in the final minutes of the match, which resulted in him missing the second leg. The 3–1 scoreline remained ensuring Lyon a wonderful opportunity to reach their first ever UEFA Champions League semi-final.|$|E
