5|$|The {{attitude}} toward the Chinese language was contradictory. In Teishi's court, Chinese had been flaunted and considered a symbol of imperial rule and superiority. Yet, in Shōshi's salon {{there was a great}} deal of hostility towards the language—perhaps owing to political expedience during a period when Chinese began to be rejected in favor of Japanese—even though Shōshi herself was a student of the language. The hostility may have affected Murasaki and her opinion of the court, and forced her to hide <b>her</b> <b>knowledge</b> of Chinese. Unlike Shōnagon, who was both ostentatious and flirtatious, as well as outspoken about <b>her</b> <b>knowledge</b> of Chinese, Murasaki seems to have been humble, an attitude which possibly impressed Michinaga. Although Murasaki used Chinese and incorporated it in her writing, she publicly rejected the language, a commendable attitude during a period of burgeoning Japanese culture.|$|E

5|$|Although Stowe {{describes}} Minnah and Judy {{with some}} tempered exasperation, she praises a riverboat stewardess named Commodore Rose. Once a slave {{owned by the}} captain, Rose had since been freed for saving his life during a boating accident and continues {{to work for him}} following emancipation. She is as forthright as Minnah and Judy, but Rose knows every portion of the river as well as the houses and sites along the banks, and their histories. <b>Her</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the ship and its guests is unparalleled, and all the crew and guests revere her opinion in all matters.|$|E

The following year, President Bonaparte was declared Emperor Napoleon III, by which time Russell's administration {{had been replaced by}} a short-lived minority government led by Lord Derby.|$|E
