500|$|On {{the first}} night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Craig Robinson {{introduced}} his younger sister. She delivered her speech, during which she sought to portray herself and her family as the embodiment of the American Dream. Obama said she and her husband believe [...] "that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, and you do what you say you're going to <b>do,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them." [...] She also emphasized loving her country, in response to criticism for her previous statements about feeling proud of her country for the first time, where the original statement was seen as a gaffe. That keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews. A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%.|$|E
500|$|Because the {{population}} of Duttlenheim was short in numbers, it proved difficult to field a team of 11 players of equal ages; Wenger did not play for FC Duttlenheim {{until the age of}} 12. Claude Wenger, a teammate of Arsène's, noted his lack of pace as a player, which he made up for with his [...] "ability to guard the ball, [...] to have a complete vision of the pitch and having an influence among his team-mates", according to Marcel Brandner, the president of FC Duttlenheim. As a young teenager, he was called Petit; the nickname ceased when he had a growth spurt and broke into FC Duttlenheim's first team, aged 16. The team did not have a coach to prepare the players tactically, rather a person who supervised training sessions. Wenger took it upon himself to manage the side, with Claude stating [...] "Arsène wasn't the captain and yet he was. It was 'You do this, you <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> do this, you do that.' He was the leader".|$|E
500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1993–94 Sheffield Shield season, Ponting spoke of his goals for the summer. [...] "I've got myself the goal of making 1,000 runs in the season. Hopefully, I can stay in the middle long enough or <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> <b>You</b> can't worry about other people's expectation. I don't care at all what is written in the press. I like to read it but it doesn't go too far into my head." [...] In Tasmania's final {{round-robin}} match of the season, they needed to defeat South Australia outright to qualify for the final. Set 366 runs to win in 102 overs, Ponting joined Dene Hills at the crease with the score at 2/35. Ponting scored 161 in a 290-run partnership that ended with Tasmania needing just 41 runs for victory. Despite Tasmania losing four quick wickets after his dismissal, they won with four wickets in hand. Disappointingly for Ponting, he could not repeat the performance in the final against New South Wales. He scored just one and 28, as Tasmania were defeated by an innings and 61 runs. The season saw Ponting score 965 runs at 48.25, close to his 1,000 run goal.|$|E

2500|$|Harding {{is first}} {{recorded}} in May 1751 {{when he played}} for All-England v Kent at the Artillery Ground. [...] All-England won by 9 runs and Harding made a significant contribution. [...] Although he had been picked as a bowler, he and [...] "A N Other" [...] (an unnamed Chertsey player) opened All-England's second innings and scored 51 for the first wicket, which is like a double century partnership nowadays.

The entire purpose behind all of this is to shift it into schools...at least that is the hope/fear among some science teachers in the area. The problem is, if you are not going to be dogmatic in Darwinism that means you inevitably have to point out a fault or at least an alternative to Darwinism. So far, the only plausible theory is ID. If one is to challenge Darwin, then one must use ID. To challenge Darwin is to challenge natural selection/spontaneous first cause...which is what the Kansas board is attempting to do. When you <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> have to invoke the idea of ID." ...|$|E

To <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> will need people at the top, decision-makers who have got foresight, good minds, who are open to ideas, who can seize opportunities like we did... My job really was to find my successors. I found them, they are there; their job is to find their successors. So there must be this continuous renewal of talented, dedicated, honest, able people who will do things not for themselves but for their people and for their country. If they can do that, they will carry on for another one generation and so it goes on. The moment that breaks, it's gone." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{think they}} always had me in mind for Nova. But they needed someone to do the screen test, and you keep trying to employ your actors. So. I did the screen test. The part that {{was hard for me}} was {{actually}} doing the mask,where they put all that plaster on your face and you have to lie there still for a long time. Fortunately, I was an acrobat growing up, and a very very good one — I won a lot of contests — so I knew how to control my body and be 'quiet.' You had to <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> had to be very still and lay there and be a 'good patient.' A young actor will do anything to get their mug on the screen! I remember that the makeup process took about three hours. I had to lay back and be perfectly still as they put this plaster mold on my face. After seeing the test, everyone was very enthusiastic about going ahead with making Planet of the Apes. But they felt the makeup needed a little more work and perfecting before it would look good on screen." ...|$|E
2500|$|McKenna saw the universe, in {{relation}} to Novelty theory, as having a teleological attractor {{at the end of}} time, which increases interconnectedness and would eventually reach a singularity of infinite complexity. He also frequently referred to this as [...] "the transcendental object at the end of time." [...] When describing this model of the universe he stated that: [...] "The universe is not being pushed from behind. The universe is being pulled from the future toward a goal that is as inevitable as a marble reaching the bottom of a bowl when you release it up near the rim. If you <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> know the marble will roll {{down the side of the}} bowl, down, down, down – until eventually it comes to rest at the lowest energy state, which is the bottom of the bowl. That's precisely my model of human history. I'm suggesting that the universe is pulled toward a complex attractor that exists ahead of us in time, and that our ever-accelerating speed through the phenomenal world of connectivity and novelty is based on the fact that we are now very, very close to the attractor." [...] Therefore, according to McKenna's final interpretation of the data and positioning of the graph, on December 21, 2012 we would have been in the unique position in time where maximum novelty would be experienced. An event he described as a [...] "concrescence", a [...] "tightening 'gyre'" [...] with everything flowing together. Speculating that [...] "when the laws of physics are obviated, the universe disappears, and what is left is the tightly bound plenum, the monad, able to express itself for itself, rather than only able to cast a shadow into physis as its reflection...It will be the entry of our species into 'hyperspace', but it will appear to be the end of physical laws, accompanied by the release of the mind into the imagination." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wu Sansi {{was killed}} in 707 in an {{unsuccessful}} coup by Emperor Zhongzong's crown prince Li Chongjun, and Cui Shi soon became closely associated with Emperor Zhongzong's powerful concubine Consort Shangguan Wan'er; traditional historians generally believed that they had an affair. [...] In 708, he became the deputy minister of defense (兵部侍郎, Bingbu Shilang). [...] (HIs father Cui Yi was then serving as the deputy minister of rites, and having father and son both serve as deputy ministers {{of one of the}} six departments of the executive bureau (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng) was unprecedented at that time.) [...] In 709, at her recommendation, by which time Cui was Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎), the deputy head of the legislative bureau, Cui was given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事), making him a chancellor de facto. [...] He and fellow chancellor Zheng Yin were also made acting deputy ministers of civil service affairs (吏部侍郎, Libu Shilang), making them in charge of selecting officials, and it was said that both he and Zheng violated civil service regulations, accepted bribes, and promoted inappropriate persons. [...] Further, his father Cui Yi was also accepting bribes and trying to influence Cui Shi, and when Cui Shi refused to follow Cui Yi's requests, the father-son relationship became a difficult one. [...] (On one occasion, Cui Yi accepted a bribe from a reserve official hoping for a commission but forgot to tell Cui Shi about it, and Cui Shi did not grant that reserve official a commission. [...] That reserve official went to see Cui Shi and asked him, [...] "Your relative accepted my bribe. [...] Why did I not get a commission?" [...] Cui Shi angrily responded, [...] "Who accepted the bribe? [...] I will cane him to death!" [...] The reserve official responded, [...] "Do not do that! [...] If you <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> will have to observe a period of mourning." [...] Cui realized that it was his father and became ashamed.) [...] Later in 709, after indictment by the censors Jin Heng (靳恆) and Li Shangyin and investigation by the censor Pei Cui (裴漼), Cui and Zheng were removed from their offices. [...] Cui was initially supposed to demoted to be the military advisor to the prefect of Jiang Prefecture (江州, roughly modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi), while Zheng was to be exiled to Ji Prefecture (吉州, roughly modern Ji'an, Jiangxi). [...] After intercession by Consort Shangguan, as well as Emperor Zhongzong's daughter Li Guo'er the Princess Anle and Li Guo'er's husband Wu Yanxiu (武延秀), Cui was instead made the prefect of Xiang Prefecture (襄州, roughly modern Xiangfan, Hubei), and Zheng was made the military advisor to the prefect of Jiang Prefecture. [...] However, later in the year, when Emperor Zhongzong was set to make sacrifices to heaven and earth south of Chang'an, he recalled both Cui and Zheng to attend to him during the ceremony, and Cui was soon made Shangshu Zuo Cheng (尚書左丞), one of the secretaries general of the executive bureau. [...] Sometime during these years, Cui also suggested that a new canal should be built between Lantian (藍田, near Chang'an) and Shang Prefecture (商州, roughly modern Shangluo, Shaanxi), and Emperor Zhongzong agreed, putting Cui in charge of the project. [...] The canal was built with some tens of thousands of conscripted laborers, and somewhere between 13 and 15 laborers died during the project. [...] Cui would eventually be recognized for the project when the older canal that the new canal replaced became unnavigable after a serious summer storm.|$|E
