40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} women, religion and the Australian state via an examination of federal anti-discrimination law. Much of the social research into religion-state relations over the last ten years, particularly {{with the rise of}} neo-liberalism, demonstrates that religious groups and ideas are actively involved in public debate, policy formation and implementation. While this has been examined by some scholars in social policy, particularly education, there has been little research on the relationship between women's rights and post-secular politics. This essay will address this gap by firstly locating women's rights in the context of global forms of neo-liberalism and specifically by examining Australian federal anti-discrimination legislation, which seeks to protect religious freedom by allowing religious <b>groups</b> general <b>exemption</b> from adhering to non-discriminatory employment and training protocols.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{exemption}} mechanism that accompanies patient co-payments for outpatient and inpatient hospital care in Serbia. The objective {{was to investigate the}} level and dynamics of out-of-pocket payments for this type of services by exempted groups (older than 65 years, younger than 15 years, unemployed, disabled and individuals with low family income) compared with that by other groups. For this purpose, we use empirical household data collected in the Serbian Living Standards Measurement Study carried out in 2002, 2003 and 2007. These years correspond {{to the start of the}} recent reforms in the Serbian healthcare sector and 1 and 5 years after the start of the reform. Our results show that people who belong to exempted groups were paying for healthcare in 2002, 2003 and 2007. They report different types of out-of-pocket payments for outpatient and inpatient hospital care. Thus, despite the ambition of the Ministry of Health in Serbia to promote equity in healthcare as a leading aim of the reforms, the implementation of the exemption mechanism fails to protect the targeted <b>groups.</b> Future <b>exemption</b> mechanism should be pro-poor oriented but should also exempt those whose health status requires a frequent healthcare use.

40|$|Reducing {{inequality}} {{by means}} of taxation {{is a major concern}} of welfare state policies. In this context, the distribution of income between men and women is considered to be an important aspect. While most economic research focuses on gender-specific effects of government expenditures (child care), this paper points at the role of tax exemptions, which contribute to gender inequality in many countries. The Austrian tax code features several allowances that reduce the taxable base for social security contributions as well as for income taxes. We show that these exemptions, in sum, lead to redistribution of income to the top, since the regressive allowances incorporated in the Austrian tax system overcompensate for allowances aiming at low-income <b>groups.</b> As these <b>exemptions</b> disproportionally reduce the tax burden for high income earners, which are disproportionately male, we conclude that on the whole the allowances in the Austrian tax code lead to a redistribution of income from women to me...|$|R

50|$|In {{the month}} {{following}} the election, the Government moved to implement its tax changes, and sought {{the support of}} Tasmanian independent senator, Brian Harradine. The senator, however, announced on 14 May 1999, that he objected in principle to the GST and would not support the bill. The sole remaining opportunity for the Government to pass the legislation through the Senate was to obtain {{the support of the}} Australian Democrats through their leader Meg Lees. Following intense and controversial negotiations, a deal was reached on 28 May whereby the concessions given to the Democrats included an exemption on basic food, more generous compensation to pensioners, and a reduction in tax cuts to higher income earners. The GST came into effect on 1 July 2000, the lead-up to which was marked by public concerns and confusion, interest <b>group</b> lobbying for <b>exemptions,</b> and the Opposition campaigning against it. The GST led to a single quarter of negative economic growth and a spike in the consumer price index, effects which proved to be transient. The implementation of the new tax system was not without problems and voter dissatisfaction with the GST increased; Labor stepped up a campaign against it, promising a partial rollback should it win office. Dissatisfaction of a majority of the Democrats membership led to a leadership contest in which Meg Lees was deposed by Natasha Stott Despoja.|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the national health insurance scheme (NHIS) in Ghana in 2003 significantly contributed to improved health services utilization and health outcomes. However, stagnating active membership, reports of poor quality health care rendered to NHIS-insured clients and cost escalations have raised concerns on the operational and financial sustainability of the scheme. This paper reviewed peer reviewed articles and grey literature on the sustainability challenges and prospects of the NHIS in Ghana. Electronic search was done for literature published between 2003 - 2016 on the NHIS and its sustainability in Ghana. A total of 66 publications relevant to health insurance in Ghana and other developing countries were retrieved from Cochrane, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Googlescholar for initial screening. Out of this number, 31 eligible peer reviewed articles were selected for final review based on specific relevance to the Ghanaian context. Ability of the NHIS to continue its operations in Ghana is threatened financially and operationally by factors such as: cost escalation, possible political interference, inadequate technical capacity, spatial distribution of health facilities and health workers, inadequate monitoring mechanisms, broad benefits package, large <b>exemption</b> <b>groups,</b> inadequate client education, and limited community engagement. Moreover, poor quality care in NHIS-accredited health facilities potentially reduces clients' trust in the scheme and consequently decreases (re) enrolment rates. These sustainability challenges were reviewed and discussed in this paper. The NHIS continues to {{play a critical role}} towards attaining universal health coverage in Ghana albeit confronted by challenges that could potentially collapse the scheme. Averting this possible predicament will largely depend on concerted efforts of key stakeholders such as health insurance managers, service providers, insurance subscribers, policy makers and political actors...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Master’s thesis is to study rules {{limiting}} deductibility of interest in taxation with related corporations by comparing rules in Finland and Russia and focusing on recharacterization of debt to equity or interest to dividend. Generally, {{there is a wide}} deductibility of interest in business taxation both in Finland and Russia. However, both countries have adopted specific rules limiting deductibility of interest in taxation. In addition to specific rules, both countries may recharterize debt to equity based on general anti avoidance rules. Russia has implemented its thin capitalization rules in 2002 when it has adopted traditional rules where interest deductibility is limited based on debt/equity ratio 3 : 1. Debt from related party exceeding the amount is classified as dividend. Historically, non discrimination clauses in double tax treaties concluded by Russia have limited the effectiveness of the rule. In addition, the related party definition has also been limited to cover only direct parent company. In newer case law it has been possible to apply the rules dispite the general non discrimination clauses. Also the concept of unreasonable tax benefit as anti avoidance doctrine has been applied more widely and all the related parties are now covered by the rules. This has caused legal uncertainty as taxpayers have limited certainty on expected outcomes of new Russian court cases. Finland has historically has no direct thin capitalization rules and it has applied quite strictly form over substance principle for defining what is debt and what is equity. General anti avoidance clause has been applied historically very rarely in case law, until a new landmark case was publish by the SAC 2016 : 72. This could lead to longstanding disputes between tax administration and taxpayers and therefore serious uncertainty may prevail for a number of years. Finland adopted specific rules regarding the limitation of interest deduction based per centage of EBITDA concept so that these rules were first time applied in 2014. Only 25 % of adjusted taxable EBITDA is deductible. However, there is significant <b>group</b> ratio <b>exemption</b> for the application of the rules (ie. if debt/equity ratio in a single company is lower than group’s similar ratio the rules do not apply). The rule is very similar to OECD BEPS report (10 / 2015) as best practice. However, {{there is a need to}} adjust Finnish rules based on EU Anti Tax Avoidance Directive (7 / 2016) by 2019. Also external interests and real estate companies needs to covered under limitation rules by then. Overall, Finland and Russia have selected different, but both OECD BEPS compatible ways to limit the tax deductibility of interest. However, in both countries there is clear uncertainty how far general anti-avoidance clauses can be applied, which may reduce the attractiveness of these countries as investment targets...|$|R

Objectives, compliance, evaluation and monitoring as status of RA 9344 were implemented as a new approach in criminal justice system with juvenile offenders. Each sector experiences problems in implementing RA 9344 {{especially when it comes to}} insufficient knowledge of the child, and the parents regarding the child’s severity of crime and constitutional rights. The study found a significant relationship between the status of implementation of RA 9344 and the problems encountered.
