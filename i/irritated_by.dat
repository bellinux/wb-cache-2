5|$|Due to the series' popularity, {{people who}} {{constantly}} complain and are <b>irritated</b> <b>by</b> minor things are often compared to Victor Meldrew by the British media. Renwick disputes this usage however, claiming that Victor's reactions are entirely {{in proportion to}} the things that happen to him.|$|E
5|$|On another occasion, he amused and {{relieved}} the House, <b>irritated</b> <b>by</b> {{the prospect of}} being obliged to listen to the reading of a mass of documents as a preliminary to a resolution, by suggesting that a dozen or so clerks be called in who might read the documents simultaneously and thus dispose of the business in a few minutes.|$|E

6000|$|... "If I can do {{anything}} for you, let me know," [...] I told him. He said nothing, {{he did not even}} smile. At this moment he was opportunely joined by a man who had the appearance of a labour leader, and I walked away. I was resentful; my mood, in brief, was that {{of a man who has}} done something foolish and is inclined to talk to himself aloud: but the mood was complicated, made the more <b>irritating</b> <b>by</b> the paradoxical fact that that last look he had given me seemed to have borne the traces of affection....|$|R
5|$|In 1911, the {{partnership}} of Coghlan, Welsh and Tancred ended when Tancred died. Around the same time, Coghlan, who was representing a mining company, encountered Ernest Guest in opposition {{in a case}} {{in the court of}} the Mining Commissioner, who judged in favour of Guest's client. Coghlan, although <b>irritated</b> <b>by</b> Guest, recognised his ability and offered him a partnership, which he accepted, leading to the formation of Coghlan, Welsh and Guest in Salisbury in 1912.|$|E
5|$|In Los Angeles, Travers is <b>irritated</b> <b>by</b> {{what she}} {{perceives}} as the city's unreality and the inhabitants' intrusive friendliness, personified by her limousine driver, Ralph. At the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, Travers meets the creative team that are developing Mary Poppins for the screen: screenwriter Don DaGradi, and music composers Richard and Robert Sherman. She finds their presumptions and casual manners highly improper, a view she also holds of the jocular Disney.|$|E
5|$|The next {{rebellion}} against royal power in Transylvania {{broke out in}} 1467. <b>Irritated</b> <b>by</b> a new tax that King Matthias Corvinus had just introduced, representatives of the Three Nations concluded an alliance against the monarch and declared the three incumbent voivodes (the brothers Counts John and Sigismund Szentgyörgyi and Berthold Ellerbach) their leaders. The king put down the revolt in a week, but did not sentence the three voivodes, because their {{active role in the}} revolt was never proven.|$|E

6000|$|... "Working {{men should}} always do that, Lady Lovel," [...] he replied, as though anxious to <b>irritate</b> her <b>by</b> {{reminding}} her how humble {{was the man}} who could aspire to be the son-in-law of a Countess.|$|R
60|$|Everard {{could not}} help smiling at this {{explosion}} of valour, engendered <b>by</b> <b>irritated</b> self-love.|$|R
5|$|Washington {{was deeply}} <b>irritated</b> <b>by</b> this subversive meddling, and when Genêt allowed a French-sponsored warship to sail out of Philadelphia against direct presidential orders, Washington demanded that France recall Genêt. However, {{by this time}} the {{revolution}} had taken a more violent approach and Genêt would have been executed had he returned to France. He appealed to Washington, and Washington allowed him to remain, making him the first political refugee to seek sanctuary in the United States.|$|E
5|$|As sensor coils {{are placed}} on the tongue of the subject, {{articulation}} may be affected depending on {{the placement of the}} coils, but no comparative analysis has shown whether articulation is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are not considered to be a particularly large source of error for measurements. Some researchers have found that subjects are <b>irritated</b> <b>by</b> sensor coils placed on the tip of the tongue which can lead to disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit articulation if not run out the side of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Chandrakumar is {{attacked}} by his company's labourers {{because he had}} suspended their union leader. Divya brings him to a nearby hospital, where he survives after receiving treatment. After he is discharged from the hospital, Divya takes care of him and realises that she has {{fallen in love with}} him. She tries to show it by wearing the anklets Chandrakumar gave her shortly after their marriage but, <b>irritated</b> <b>by</b> what he sees as Divya's immaturity, Chandrakumar asks her to return to her parents home and books her trip. At the railway station, Chandrakumar gives Divya the divorce papers that she had requested as a wedding gift. Divya breaks down, telling Chandrakumar that she loves him, and they reconcile.|$|E
50|$|A {{writer for}} {{business}} organisation ICAEW commented that text roulette {{is a modern}} variation on an old pattern, i.e. young people finding ways to <b>irritate</b> adults <b>by</b> doing what is forbidden, but raises concerns about child safety.|$|R
5000|$|Bronco Billy talks Antoinette into {{becoming}} his new assistant, [...] "Miss Lily," [...] {{though she}} only agrees {{to do one}} show. Her first performance is unusually successful, although Miss Lily <b>irritates</b> Billy <b>by</b> not sticking to the script.|$|R
5000|$|In the Simpsons episode [...] "I'm with Cupid", which {{features}} Elton John playing himself, Apu <b>irritates</b> John <b>by</b> deliberately punning that [...] "Someone saved your life tonight" [...] after his quick response prevents the singer {{being struck by}} a crashing plane.|$|R
5|$|In late 1969, Zappa {{broke up}} the band. He often cited the {{financial}} strain as the main reason, but also commented on the band members' lack of sufficient effort. Many band members were bitter about Zappa's decision, and some {{took it as a}} sign of Zappa's concern for perfection at the expense of human feeling. Others were <b>irritated</b> <b>by</b> 'his autocratic ways', exemplified by Zappa's never staying at the same hotel as the band members. Several members played for Zappa in years to come. Remaining recordings with the band from this period were collected on Weasels Ripped My Flesh and Burnt Weeny Sandwich (both released in 1970).|$|E
5|$|Although {{a quarter}} of their funding went on {{repairing}} damage to Caltech buildings caused by their experiments, in June 1940 they submitted {{a report to the}} NAS in which they showed the feasibility of the project for the development of JATO and requested $100,000 to continue; they received $22,000. Now known as GALCIT Project Number 1, they continued to be ostracized by other Caltech scientists who grew increasingly <b>irritated</b> <b>by</b> their accidents and noise pollution, and were made to relocate their experiments back to the Arroyo Seco, at a site with unventilated, corrugated iron sheds that served as both research facilities and administrative offices. It was here that JPL would be founded. Parsons and Forman's rocket experiments were the cover story of the August 1940 edition of Popular Mechanics, in which the pair discussed the prospect of rockets being able to ascend above Earth's atmosphere and orbit around it for research purposes, as well as reaching the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Becoming irritated {{that no one}} {{joined in}} him in walking out on Gabe, Michael goes outside and pulls the cable connection, causing it to turn off. Hysteria erupts, and Michael becomes {{self-conscious}} over the commotion he has caused. He goes outside to fix the cable. There he is discovered by Erin, who throughout the evening {{has been trying to}} encourage Michael to bond with Gabe. Michael, still indignant over the idea that his office views Gabe as his boss, is initially <b>irritated</b> <b>by</b> her efforts, but eventually realizes that Erin views him as a father figure. He jokes around and tells her to go to her room, leading to a bonding moment between the two. As he leaves the party, Michael brings Gabe into the joke by threatening to kill him if he breaks Erin's heart.|$|E
5000|$|In Woody Allen's 1977 Oscar-winning film Annie Hall, Allen's {{character}} {{goes on a}} {{date with}} a rock journalist, played by Shelley Duvall, who <b>irritates</b> him <b>by</b> reciting the chorus of [...] "Just Like a Woman" [...] when recalling a Dylan concert.|$|R
5000|$|For Ronald Bergan and Robyn Karney in the Bloomsbury Foreign Film Guide, [...] "the film obstinately {{refuses to}} cast light on its characters, making {{it no more}} than a {{superficial}} and sporadically entertaining exercise." [...] Geoff Andrew in the Time Out Film Guide describes the film as [...] "charmless...it <b>irritates</b> <b>by</b> its over-wrought sense of literary-style paradox, and by its insistence on eccentricity as its source of humour". Melissa E. Biggs though, in French Films 1945-1993, describes it as [...] "an extraordinary film ... made at just the right moment in time, when sexual obsession could still be ironic and celebrated and not held up to scorn by political correctness and feminist righteousness".|$|R
60|$|I {{do think}} that, {{of all the}} silly, <b>irritating</b> tomfoolishness <b>by</b> which we are plagued, this “weather-forecast” fraud is about the most aggravating. It “forecasts” {{precisely}} what happened yesterday or a the day before, and precisely {{the opposite of what}} is going to happen to-day.|$|R
5|$|For {{the rest}} of his life, Marmarosa alternated between living with his sister Doris' family and in a veterans' hospital, both in the Pittsburgh area. Some of his friends blamed Marmarosa's family for keeping him in their home because of shame about his mental problems, and {{suggested}} that the family blamed musicians and music for his instability. Marmarosa himself did not explain his withdrawal from performing. <b>Irritated</b> <b>by</b> telephone calls from a fan seeking an interview in 1992, Marmarosa passed on the news that he had died; this led to premature obituaries being published in two British newspapers. He sometimes played piano in the family's basement or for other residents at the hospital. His mother died in 1995, after his father. Marmarosa {{died of a heart attack}} on September 17, 2002, in a veterans' hospital in Pittsburgh. He was survived by his two sisters.|$|E
5|$|Guest came {{up against}} Sir Charles Coghlan, the senior partner of Coghlan and Welsh, {{in a case}} before the Court of the Mining Commissioner. Coghlan {{represented}} a mining company, which had pegged some gold claims on Guest's client's farm. The Commissioner gave judgment in favour of Guest, who had been instructed to oppose their registration. Following this case, although initially <b>irritated</b> <b>by</b> Guest, Coghlan invited him to join his firm in Salisbury, which Guest did in January 1912. The Salisbury office had been opened by Bernard Tancred. His passing away provided the opportunity for Guest to join the firm as a partner. For a while, the firm was known as Coghlan, Welsh, Townsend and Guest, when Townsend, one of the 1820 Settlers in the Eastern Cape, joined the firm in Salisbury. It reverted to Coghlan, Welsh and Guest, when Townsend died a little time later.|$|E
5|$|In 1173 John's elder brothers, {{backed by}} Eleanor, rose in revolt against Henry in the {{short-lived}} rebellion of 1173 to 1174. Growing irritated with his subordinate position to Henry II and increasingly worried that John might be given additional lands and castles at his expense, Henry the Young King travelled to Paris and allied himself with Louis VII. Eleanor, <b>irritated</b> <b>by</b> her husband's persistent interference in Aquitaine, encouraged Richard and Geoffrey {{to join their}} brother Henry in Paris. Henry II triumphed over the coalition of his sons, but was generous {{to them in the}} peace settlement agreed at Montlouis. Henry the Young King was allowed to travel widely in Europe with his own household of knights, Richard was given Aquitaine back, and Geoffrey was allowed to return to Brittany; only Eleanor was imprisoned for her role in the revolt.|$|E
5000|$|Sam, Rick's daughter, and Ben, her boyfriend, often <b>irritate</b> Rick <b>by</b> {{asking for}} money from him and then wasting it. Ben annoys Rick the most, for example when he breaks Rick's DVD player after taking the back cover off and thereby {{breaking}} the security seal thus invalidating the warranty.|$|R
60|$|For {{some time}} Helena sat at {{table in the}} dining-room staring before her. Her parents moved restlessly in silence, trying not to <b>irritate</b> her <b>by</b> {{watching}} her, praying for something to change the fixity of her look. They acknowledged themselves helpless; like children, they felt powerless and forlorn, and were very quiet.|$|R
6000|$|It {{happened}} {{about the}} date of the Geddington match that he took out from the school library a copy of [...] "The Iron Pirate," [...] and for the next day or two he wandered about like a lost spirit trying to find a sequestered spot in which to read it. His inability to hit on such a spot was rendered more <b>irritating</b> <b>by</b> the fact that, to judge from the first few chapters (which he had managed to get through during prep. one night under the eye of a short-sighted master), the book was obviously the last word in hot stuff. He tried the junior day-room, but people threw cushions at him. He tried out of doors, and a ball hit from a neighbouring net nearly scalped him. Anything in the nature of concentration became impossible in these circumstances.|$|R
5|$|In a flashback, {{after losing}} his mother, Gopal, in his sorrow had been {{wandering}} aimlessly at Singapore. In a nightclub, he meets a singer named Chitra. He gets {{attracted to her}} and they decide to marry, {{in the presence of}} Chitra's brother Raju. But he is disappointed— from the very first day of their marriage, she comes home inebriated, and despite his repeated requests, has little respect for tradition and family values. Eventually, Gopal's father dies of a heart attack after seeing Chitra's drunken behaviour on Gopal's birthday. Gopal tries to control Chitra, but she is always <b>irritated</b> <b>by</b> his acts. At one point, she tries to leave him. Gopal begs her to change her decision, but Chitra still leaves. The next day, he hears that Chitra had died on a railway track, and this hurts him a lot. Latha sympathises with Gopal and accepts his love.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the majestic yet fairly traditional compositions by the two Strausses and Khachaturian, Kubrick used four highly modernistic compositions by György Ligeti that employ micropolyphony, the use of sustained dissonant chords that shift slowly. This technique was pioneered in Atmosphères, the only Ligeti piece heard in its entirety in the film. Ligeti admired Kubrick's film but, in {{addition to}} being <b>irritated</b> <b>by</b> Kubrick's failure to obtain permission directly from him, he was offended that his music was used in a film soundtrack shared by composers Johann Strauss II and Richard Strauss. Other music used is Ligeti's Lux Aeterna, the second movement of his Requiem and an electronically altered form of his Aventures, the last of which was also used without Ligeti's permission and is not listed in the film's credits.|$|E
5|$|Kalyani becomes pregnant. But {{on the day}} she {{delivers}} her child, Thangappan dies in {{an accident}} and Manickampillai dies of shock, leaving Kalyani and her child destitute. Her house gets auctioned off, and she makes her living by selling food on the streets. Gunasekaran, after being stranded at sea for several months, finally arrives in Tamil Nadu at Madras. However, while watching a dance performance, he is robbed of all his belongings after being intoxicated. Impoverished, he becomes enraged at the status of the once glorious Tamil Nadu, and fakes insanity by indulging in numerous tricks to make a living. Gunasekaran finally comes across his destitute sister at Madurai, having learned of their father's death and her poverty. He continues to play insane and does not reveal his true identity to her due to his poverty, but hovers around her. Kalyani is <b>irritated</b> <b>by</b> the stranger's behaviour, unaware that he is her brother.|$|E
50|$|Tartar emetic is {{produced}} when potassium tartrate is heated with antimony trioxide. Tartar emetic causes intense nausea, prostration and vomiting <b>by</b> <b>irritating</b> the gastrointestinal mucosa.|$|R
50|$|Cryptomonad ejectosomes contain two {{connected}} spiral ribbon-like structures, {{held under}} tension. If the cells are <b>irritated</b> either <b>by</b> mechanical, chemical or light stress, they discharge, propelling the cell in a zig-zag course {{away from the}} disturbance. Large ejectisomes, visible under the light microscope, {{are associated with the}} pocket; smaller ones occur elsewhere on the cell.|$|R
