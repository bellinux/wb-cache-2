In {{the early decades of the}} 20th century, the minor components of foods in human nutrition, the vitamins, began to be isolated and synthesized. Improved laboratory techniques such as chromatography and electrophoresis led to rapid advances in physiological chemistry, which—as biochemistry—began to achieve independence from its medical origins. In the 1920s and 1930s, biochemists—led by Hans Krebs and Carl and Gerty Cori—began to work out many of the central metabolic pathways of life: the citric acid cycle, <b>glycogenesis</b> and glycolysis, and the synthesis of steroids and porphyrins. Between the 1930s and 1950s, Fritz Lipmann and others established the role of ATP as the universal carrier of energy in the cell, and mitochondria as the powerhouse of the cell. Such traditionally biochemical work continued to be very actively pursued throughout the 20th century and into the 21st.|$|E

The permissive effect of cortisol on insulin action in liver <b>glycogenesis</b> is observed in hepatocyte culture in the laboratory, although the mechanism for this is unknown.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} fasting state, the {{function}} of cortisol changes slightly and increases <b>glycogenesis.</b> This response allows the liver to take up glucose not {{being used by the}} peripheral tissue and turn it into liver glycogen stores to be used if the body moves into the starvation state.|$|E
25|$|Epinephrine acts by binding to {{a variety}} of {{adrenergic}} receptors. Epinephrine is a nonselective agonist of all adrenergic receptors, including the major subtypes α1, α2, β1, β2, and β3. Epinephrine's binding to these receptors triggers a number of metabolic changes. Binding to α-adrenergic receptors inhibits insulin secretion by the pancreas, stimulates glycogenolysis in the liver and muscle, and stimulates glycolysis and inhibits insulin-mediated <b>glycogenesis</b> in muscle. β adrenergic receptor binding triggers glucagon secretion in the pancreas, increased adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion by the pituitary gland, and increased lipolysis by adipose tissue. Together, these effects lead to increased blood glucose and fatty acids, providing substrates for energy production within cells throughout the body.|$|E
25|$|The Insulin Receptor {{is a type}} of {{tyrosine}} kinase receptor, in which the binding of an agonistic ligand triggers autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residues, with each subunit phosphorylating its partner. The addition of the phosphate groups generates a binding site for the insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1), which is subsequently activated via phosphorylation. The activated IRS-1 initiates the signal transduction pathway and binds to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), in turn causing its acivation. This then catalyses the conversion of Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-bisphosphate into Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 acts as a secondary messenger and induces the activation of phosphatidylinositol dependant protein kinase, which then activates several other kinases – most notably Akt, (also known as protein kinase B). Akt triggers the translocation of glucose transporter (GLUT4) containing vesicles to the cell membrane, via the activation of SNARE proteins, to facilitate the diffusion of glucose into the cell. Akt also phosphorylates and inhibits glycogen synthase kinase, which is an enzyme that inhibits glycogen synthase. Therefore, Akt acts to start the process of <b>glycogenesis,</b> which ultimately reduces blood-glucose concentration.|$|E

2500|$|Insulin (from the Latin, insula meaning island) is a {{peptide hormone}} {{produced}} by beta {{cells of the}} pancreatic islets, and it {{is considered to be}} the main anabolic hormone of the body. It regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and protein by promoting the absorption of, especially, glucose from the blood into fat, liver and skeletal muscle cells. [...] In these tissues the absorbed glucose is converted into either glycogen via <b>glycogenesis</b> or fats (triglycerides) via lipogenesis, or, {{in the case of the}} liver, into both. [...] Glucose production and secretion by the liver is strongly inhibited by high concentrations of insulin in the blood. Circulating insulin also affects the synthesis of proteins in a wide variety of tissues. It is therefore an anabolic hormone, promoting the conversion of small molecules in the blood into large molecules inside the cells. Low insulin levels in the blood have the opposite effect by promoting widespread catabolism.|$|E

50|$|In <b>{{glycogen}}esis,</b> {{free glucose}} 1-phosphate can also react with UTP to form UDP-glucose, {{by using the}} enzyme UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. It can {{then return to the}} greater glycogen structure via glycogen synthase.|$|E
50|$|Glycogen {{serves as}} the {{secondary}} long-term energy storage in animal and fungal cells, with the primary energy stores being held in adipose tissue. Glycogen is made primarily by the liver and the muscles, but can also be made by <b>glycogenesis</b> within the brain and stomach.|$|E
50|$|In higher animals, {{the enzyme}} is highly active in tissues {{involved}} in <b>glycogenesis,</b> including {{the liver and}} the muscles. An exception is the brain, which has high levels of glycogen but low specific activity of UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. In animal cells, UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is found predominantly in the cytoplasm.|$|E

50|$|<b>Glycogenesis</b> is {{the process}} of {{glycogen}} synthesis, in which glucose molecules are added to chains of glycogen for storage. This process is activated during rest periods following the Cori cycle, in the liver, and also activated by insulin in response to high glucose levels, for example after a carbohydrate-containing meal.|$|E
5000|$|Glycogen synthase (UDP-glucose-glycogen glucosyltransferase) is a {{key enzyme}} in <b>glycogenesis,</b> the {{conversion}} of glucose into glycogen. It is a glycosyltransferase (...) that catalyses the reaction of UDP-glucose and (1,4-α-D-glucosyl)n to yield UDP and (1,4-α-D-glucosyl)n+1. In other words, this enzyme combines excess glucose residues one by one into a polymeric chain for storage as glycogen.|$|E
50|$|Epinephrine {{not only}} {{activates}} glycogen phosphorylase but also inhibits glycogen synthase. This amplifies {{the effect of}} activating glycogen phosphorylase. This inhibition is achieved by a similar mechanism, as protein kinase A acts to phosphorylate the enzyme, which lowers activity. This is known as co-ordinate reciprocal control. Refer to glycolysis for further information of the regulation of <b>glycogenesis.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In plants, {{according}} to a paper in 2006 in Nature, the exponent of mass is close to 1. [...] Mathematically this is not possible since {{the implication is that}} ME is greater than 100% in the case of plants. The key problem is the nature of metabolic energy and the extent of what is considered metabolism. The problem is most clearly noticeable in the unit term for metabolic rate, i.e., calories/s. Calories are a measure of heat energy. This leads to the idea that thermogenesis is part of metabolism, Kleiber's original treatment, and rules out that metabolism is all about chemical energy, not heat energy. The picture is further obfuscated when the idea of respiratory metabolism is introduced to refine and limit the definition of metabolism such that oxygen consumption and synthesis of ATP are its ultimate factors. The data from study of oxygen consumption metabolic rates in cells in vitro suggests that the exponent is not only far less than ¾, but also becomes negative for things less than one gram in size. Furthermore, <b>glycogenesis</b> is excluded from metabolic consideration on this model since <b>glycogenesis</b> is not included in the respiratory chain, and is itself a reduction reaction not strictly dependent upon the proximity of certain molecules and atoms delivered by capillaries and vibrating from Brownian motion. Energy is required for <b>glycogenesis,</b> and the blood does not deliver energy, just the ingredients for endergonic reactions. The energy comes from redox coupling, what ME is all about.|$|E
50|$|UDP is an {{important}} factor in <b>glycogenesis.</b> Before glucose can be stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles, the enzyme UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase forms a UDP-glucose unit by combining glucose 1-phosphate with uridine triphosphate, cleaving a pyrophosphate ion in the process. Then, the enzyme glycogen synthase combines UDP-glucose units to form a glycogen chain. The UDP molecule is cleaved from the glucose ring during this process and can be reused by UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase.|$|E
50|$|Moderation is advised {{with regard}} to {{consuming}} alcohol and using some drugs. Alcohol inhibits <b>glycogenesis</b> in the liver and some drugs inhibit hunger symptoms. This, with impaired judgment, memory and concentration caused by some drugs can lead to hypoglycemia. People with diabetes who take insulin or tablets such as sulphonylureas should not, therefore, consume alcohol {{on an empty stomach}} but take some starchy food (such as bread or potato crisps) {{at the same time as}} consumption of alcohol.|$|E
50|$|The liver {{performs}} several {{roles in}} carbohydrate metabolism: The liver synthesizes and stores approximately 100g of glycogen via <b>glycogenesis,</b> {{the formation of}} glycogen from glucose. When needed, the liver releases glucose into the blood by performing glycogenolysis, the breakdown of glycogen into glucose. The liver is also responsible for gluconeogenesis, which is the synthesis of glucose from certain amino acids, lactate or glycerol. Adipose and liver cells produce glycerol by breakdown of fat, which the liver uses for gluconeogenesis.|$|E
50|$|PFK1 is {{the most}} {{important}} control site in the mammalian glycolytic pathway. This step is subject to extensive regulation since it is not only highly exergonic under physiological conditions, but also because it is a committed step - the first irreversible reaction unique to the glycolytic pathway. This leads to a precise control of glucose and the other monosaccharides galactose and fructose going down the glycolytic pathway. Before this enzyme's reaction, glucose-6-phosphate can potentially travel down the pentose phosphate pathway, or be converted to glucose-1-phosphate for <b>glycogenesis.</b>|$|E
50|$|UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is {{an enzyme}} {{found in all}} three domains (bacteria, eukarya, and archaea) {{as it is a}} key player in <b>glycogenesis</b> and cell wall synthesis. Its role in sugar {{metabolism}} has been studied extensively in plants in order to understand plant growth and increase agricultural production. Recently, human UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase has been studied and crystallized, revealing a different type of regulation than other organisms previously studied. Its significance is derived from the many uses of UDP-glucose including galactose metabolism, glycogen synthesis, glycoprotein synthesis, and glycolipid synthesis.|$|E
50|$|Instead of accumulating {{inside the}} muscle cells, lactate {{produced}} by anaerobic fermentation {{is taken up}} by the liver. This initiates {{the other half of the}} Cori cycle. In the liver, gluconeogenesis occurs. From an intuitive perspective, gluconeogenesis reverses both glycolysis and fermentation by converting lactate first into pyruvate, and finally back to glucose. The glucose is then supplied to the muscles through the bloodstream; it is ready to be fed into further glycolysis reactions. If muscle activity has stopped, the glucose is used to replenish the supplies of glycogen through <b>glycogenesis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Upon {{eating a}} meal, {{there is a}} release of insulin, {{signaling}} glucose availability in the blood. Insulin indirectly activates PP-1 and phosphodiesterase. The PP-1 directly dephosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase a, reforming the inactive glycogen phosphorylase b. The phosphodiesterase converts cAMP to AMP. This activity removes the second messenger (generated by glucagon and epinephrine) and inhibits PKA. In this manner, PKA can no longer cause the phosphorylation cascade that ends with formation of (active) glycogen phosphorylase a. These modifications initiated by insulin end glycogenolysis {{in order to preserve}} what glycogen stores are left in the cell and trigger <b>glycogenesis</b> (rebuilding of glycogen).|$|E

Together, these effects lead to increased blood glucose and fatty acids, providing substrates for energy production within cells throughout the body.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{the liver}} plays a {{dominant}} role in blood glucose homeostasis by maintaining {{a balance between}} the uptake and storage of glucose through the metabolic pathways of <b>glycogenesis</b> and gluconeogenesis. In recent studies, it is illustrated that intestinal lipids regulate glucose homeostasis involving a gut-brain-liver axis. The direct administration of lipids into the upper intestine increases the long chain fatty acyl-coenzyme A (LCFA-CoA) levels in the upper intestines and suppresses glucose production even under sub diaphragmatic vagotomy or gut vagal deafferentation. This interrupts the neural connection between the brain and the gut and blocks the upper intestinal lipids’ ability to inhibit glucose production. The gut-brain-liver axis and gut microbiota composition can regulate the glucose homeostasis in the liver and provide potential therapeutic methods to treat obesity and diabetes.|$|E

50|$|The liver is {{the second}} largest organ (after the skin) and is an {{accessory}} digestive gland which {{plays a role in}} the body's metabolism. The liver has many functions some of which are important to digestion.The liver can detoxify various metabolites; synthesise proteins and produce biochemicals needed for digestion. It regulates the storage of glycogen which it can form from glucose (<b>glycogenesis).</b> The liver can also synthesise glucose from certain amino acids. Its digestive functions are largely involved with the breaking down of carbohydrates. It also maintains protein metabolism in its synthesis and degradation. In lipid metabolism it synthesises cholesterol. Fats are also produced in the process of lipogenesis. The liver synthesises the bulk of lipoproteins. The liver is located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen and below the diaphragm to which it is attached at one part, This is {{to the right of the}} stomach and it overlies the gall bladder. The liver produces bile, an important alkaline compound which aids digestion.|$|E
50|$|When {{levels of}} blood sugar rise, whether {{as a result}} of {{glycogen}} conversion, or from digestion of a meal, a different hormone is released from beta cells found in the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. This hormone, insulin, causes the liver to convert more glucose into glycogen (this process is called <b>glycogenesis),</b> and to force about 2/3 of body cells (primarily muscle and fat tissue cells) to take up glucose from the blood through the GLUT4 transporter, thus decreasing blood sugar. When insulin binds to the receptors on the cell surface, vesicles containing the GLUT4 transporters come to the plasma membrane and fuse together by the process of endocytosis, thus enabling a facilitated diffusion of glucose into the cell. As soon as the glucose enters the cell, it is phosphorylated into Glucose-6-Phosphate in order to preserve the concentration gradient so glucose will continue to enter the cell. Insulin also provides signals to several other body systems, and is the chief regulator of metabolic control in humans.|$|E

A PTEN-specific siRNA was used to further determine the effect of PTEN on IL- 6 -induced insulin resistance.
