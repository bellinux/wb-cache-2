5|$|Although {{the seeds}} of both {{proactive}} government repression against the Puerto Rican independence movement had been planted before the Grito de Lares, and its aftermath only guaranteed the surge of autonomism as a political alternative in the island, the level of cultural and social development of a collective Puerto Rican conscience was almost {{a direct consequence of}} the event. To put <b>it</b> <b>simply,</b> if there is any nationalistic sentiment in Puerto Rico in the present day, almost all of it {{can be traced back to}} Betances and his political work.|$|E
5|$|Behavior theorists see delaying {{gratification}} as {{an adaptive}} skill. It {{has been shown}} that learning to delay gratification promotes positive social behavior, such as sharing and positive peer interactions. For example, students who learn to delay gratification are better able to complete their assigned activities. To put <b>it</b> <b>simply,</b> if someone undertakes an activity with the promise of a delayed reward after, the task's completion becomes more likely.|$|E
5|$|South Ledge {{falls within}} the {{apparently}} overlapping territorial waters generated by the mainland of Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. Although in the Special Agreement and in their final submissions Malaysia and Singapore had asked the Court to decide which state had sovereignty over Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, the Court had not been mandated to delimit {{the extent of the}} territorial waters of the two states in the area in question. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> held that South Ledge, as a low-tide elevation, belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located.|$|E

5|$|The Calculus Affair began {{serialisation}} in Tintin magazine's Christmas edition on 22 December 1954, {{and continued}} {{to appear in the}} pages of that publication until 22 February 1956. It would be the first of The Adventures of Tintin to be serialised without interruption since Red Rackham's Treasure (1944). Serialisation began in the French edition of Tintin in February 1955. It was subsequently published in single form as L'Affaire Tournesol by Casterman in 1956. For this volume Hergé had designed a front cover; initially, <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> showed Tintin and Haddock hiding Calculus from Bordurian soldiers, but he subsequently added shattered yellow glass {{around the edges of the}} image for dramatic effect.|$|E
5|$|A further {{six years}} elapsed before Nine Inch Nails' fourth {{full-length}} album. With Teeth {{was released in}} May 2005, though it was leaked prior to its official release date. The album was written and recorded throughout 2004 following Reznor's battle with alcoholism and substance abuse and legal issues with his former manager, John Malm Jr. With Teeth debuted {{on top of the}} Billboard 200, Nine Inch Nails' second reign at number one with an album. The album's package lacks typical liner notes; instead <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> lists the names of songs and co-producers, and the URL for an online PDF poster with lyrics and full credits. The entire album was made available in streaming audio on the band's official MySpace page in advance of its release date.|$|E
5|$|Another film {{purported to}} have been the highest-grosser is the 1972 pornographic film, Deep Throat. In 1984, Linda Lovelace testified to a United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on {{juvenile}} justice that the film had earned $600 million; this figure {{has been the subject of}} much speculation, since if it is accurate then the film would have made more money than Star Wars, and finished the 1970s as the highest-grossing film. The main argument against this figure is that <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> did not have a wide enough release to sustain the sort of sums that would be required for it to ultimately gross this amount. Exact figures are not known, but testimony in a federal trial in 1976—about four years into the film's release—showed the film had grossed over $25 million. Roger Ebert has reasoned it possibly did earn as much as $600 million on paper, since mobsters owned most of the adult movie theaters during this period and would launder income from drugs and prostitution through them, so probably inflated the box office receipts for the film.|$|E

5|$|As a result, a {{bill was}} {{proposed}} in the House of Commons that sought to punish the City of Edinburgh for the behaviour of its citizens by disenfranchising the city. Murray represented the City in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and eventually whittled down the bill so much {{that by the time}} it was voted on, <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> proposed to fine the city and disqualify the Provost. In exchange for his work, the citizens of Edinburgh gave him the Freedom of the City and a diamond, which is still in the possession of his family. Murray's reputation continued to grow; in 1738, he was involved in 11 of the 16 cases heard in the House of Lords, and in 1739 and 1740 he acted as legal counsel in 30 cases there.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the emperor Lebna Dengel and the Portuguese had {{established}} diplomatic {{contact with each other}} in 1520, Prester John was the name by which Europeans knew the Emperor of Ethiopia. The Ethiopians, though, had never called their emperor that. When ambassadors from Emperor Zara Yaqob attended the Council of Florence in 1441, they were confused when council prelates insisted on referring to their monarch as Prester John. They tried to explain that nowhere in Zara Yaqob's list of regnal names did that title occur. However, their admonitions did little to stop Europeans from calling the King of Ethiopia Prester John. Some writers who used the title did understand it was not an indigenous honorific; for instance Jordanus seems to use <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> because his readers would have been familiar with it, not because he thought it authentic.|$|E
5|$|Like Pedra Branca, the Sultan of Johor {{held the}} {{original}} ancient title to Middle Rocks. As Singapore had not exercised any {{rights as a}} sovereign over Middle Rocks, the ICJ determined that Malaysia retained sovereignty over this maritime feature. As for South Ledge, the ICJ noted that it fell within the apparently overlapping territorial waters of mainland Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. As the Court had not been mandated {{to draw the line}} of delimitation with respect to the territorial waters of Malaysia and Singapore in the area in question, <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> held that sovereignty over South Ledge belonged to the state which owned the territorial waters in which it is located.|$|E

5|$|Nike Zeus was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} straightforward development of the earlier Hercules system giving it the ability to hit ICBM warheads at about the same range and altitude as the maximum performance of the Hercules. In theory, hitting a warhead is no more difficult than an aircraft; the interceptor does not have to travel any further or faster, the computers that guide <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> have to select an intercept point farther in front of the target to compensate for the target's much higher speed. In practice, the difficulty is detecting the target early enough that the intercept point is still within range of the missile. This demands much larger and more powerful radar systems, and faster computers.|$|E
5|$|The {{exact nature}} of {{relations}} between Tibet and the Ming dynasty of China (1368–1644) is unclear. Analysis of the relationship is further complicated by modern political conflicts {{and the application of}} Westphalian sovereignty to a time when the concept did not exist. Some Mainland Chinese scholars, such as Wang Jiawei and Nyima Gyaincain, assert that the Ming dynasty had unquestioned sovereignty over Tibet, pointing to the Ming court's issuing of various titles to Tibetan leaders, Tibetans' full acceptance of these titles, and a renewal process for successors of these titles that involved traveling to the Ming capital. Scholars within China also argue that Tibet has been an integral part of China since the 13th century and that it was thus a part of the Ming Empire. But most scholars outside China, such as Turrell V. Wylie, Melvin C. Goldstein, and Helmut Hoffman, say that the relationship was one of suzerainty, that Ming titles were only nominal, that Tibet remained an independent region outside Ming control, and that <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> paid tribute until the Jiajing Emperor (1521–1566), who ceased relations with Tibet.|$|E
5|$|Theories {{about the}} origin of {{language}} differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are {{based on the idea that}} language is so complex that one cannot imagine <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on Chomsky's generative view of language see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.|$|E

5|$|Two minor controversies marked Beshear's {{tenure as}} {{attorney}} general. The {{first came in}} the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in the 1980 case of Stone v. Graham. The ruling struck down the state law requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in all of the state's classrooms on grounds that it violated the Establishment Clause of the federal constitution. State Superintendent Raymond Barber asked the Supreme Court to clarify whether its ruling meant that all of the copies of the Commandments already posted had to be taken down or whether <b>it</b> <b>simply</b> invalidated the Kentucky requirement for them to be posted; the Court refused the request for clarification. Beshear then issued an advisory opinion that displaying the Commandments in classrooms under any circumstances was banned by the Court's ruling.|$|E
5|$|When the UCI {{released}} {{its list of}} teams graded according to their hierarchy that decided who would receive a World Tour license, this team's signees put them at the top, making them world number one before they even existed.

Whether intentionally or incidentally, this corresponded to the initial financial guarantee Becca put up for the team. Nygaard hailed the license acquisition as the fruition of many months of hard work.
