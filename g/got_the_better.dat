Both Williams and Ferrari had another good session, while Lotus got both their drivers in the top ten, raising hopes for a points finish on Sunday. Red Bull continued to struggle, with Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat down in 15th and 18th and Ricciardo's car stopping {{at the end of}} pit lane due to engine problems.

He then travelled to Berlin for another encounter with Münzenberg, where pre-match he witnessed first hand the foreboding devotion the people showed the Führer when his motorcade drove past a café the England team were dining in. The game became infamous as The FA, themselves under instruction from the British government, informed the England team {{that they had}} to perform the Nazi salute as part of the strategy of appeasement. England won 6–3 with Matthews himself getting on the scoreboard having <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> of Münzenberg this time. The next game was a shock 2–1 defeat to Switzerland, which in turn was followed by a 4–2 win over France in Paris. Following the conclusion of this summer tour of the continent, Matthews scored in a 4–2 defeat to Wales in Cardiff, and then played in England's 3–0 win over a Europe XI at Highbury, their 4–0 win over Norway in Newcastle, and their 7–0 win over Ireland at Old Trafford.|$|E

Russell's boats also took the surrender of America, her crew boarding the vessel to make her a prize (although later replaced by men from Royal Sovereign). Royal Sovereign lost Admiral Graves to a serious wound and lost her opponent as well, as Terrible fell out of the line to windward and joined a growing collection of French ships forming a new line {{on the far side of}} the action. Villaret was leading this line in his flagship Montagne, which had escaped from Queen Charlotte, and it was Montagne which Royal Sovereign engaged next, pursuing her close to the new French line accompanied by Valiant, and beginning a long-range action.|$|E

By age 13, he had {{graduated}} to having his own chair in the Fragapane barber shop, although he stood on a box to tend to his customers. It was also around this time that young Como lost his week's wages in a dice game. Filled with shame, he locked himself in his room and did not come out until hunger <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> of him. He managed to tell his father {{what had happened to}} the money his family depended on. His father told him he was entitled to make a mistake and that he hoped his son would never do anything worse than this.

40|$|Abstract. Air {{pollution}} {{has been}} deteriorated seriously in Shanghai {{as a result}} of urbanization and modernization. Visibility reduction is the most apparent symptom of air pollution. This paper aims to describe the characteristics of visibility and air pollutants in Shanghai, and to investigate the relationship between them. Visibility in Shanghai was higher in summer and lower in winter. The mean value of visibility during 2006 - 2010 was 17. 8 km. Air pollution in Shanghai was also serious. In 2010, Shanghai <b>got</b> <b>the</b> relative <b>better</b> air quality compared with the former four years. Air pollutants and visibility were negatively correlated. SO 2 and NO 2 had higher correlation coefficients with visibility than PM 10. This suggested that the visibility in Shanghai was mainly due to secondary pollutants...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, some {{experiments}} {{was implemented}} for analyzing the affecting factors on allowable contact stress of four-point-contact slewing rings with single row including the hardening depth, hardness and the osculation between the steel {{ball and the}} raceway. Firstly, the common material 42 CrMo was chosen and heat-treated with some process of heat treatment for getting different hardening depth. And then, the indentation tests were conducted with the test-rig, followed by the data process. Finally, some conclusions {{can be obtained by}} comparing and analyzing the data. It concludes that when the hardening depth beyond 0. 3 and the hardness is not lower than 57 HRC, a better allowable contact stress can be <b>got,</b> besides, <b>the</b> <b>better</b> osculation 0. 52 is <b>better</b> for <b>the</b> load capacity...|$|R

Senna argued it was the restart. Prost himself was angered by McLaren apparently favouring Senna because of Senna's better relationship with engine supplier Honda, so he announced mid-season that he had signed to race for Ferrari the following season.|$|R
