2500|$|The Alpine Sleigh Ride {{was a dark}} ride {{attraction}} {{which opened}} during the park's first season. It had a ride control system and vehicles (ArrowGlide) designed by Arrow Development. Riders passed through an alpine forest before reaching the show building {{which was designed to}} resemble a large mountain capped with snow. A waterfall cascaded from atop the mountain and down into a catch pond near the mountain's base. Once past the waterfall, riders would journey through many chambers within the mountain. These included an echo tunnel and an avalanche room with simulated snow. At several points throughout the ride, the vehicles would exit and travel along the exterior of the mountain-themed show building. The sleigh-themed vehicles were powered by an <b>electrical</b> <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> where portions of the track ascended, and they were gravity powered during the descents which featured several surprise dips. Part of the show building was shared with the adjacent gas powered car ride (Le Taxi) which passed through a tunnel {{in the side of the}} mountain. The ride included an appearance by the [...] "Abominable Snowman". Alpine Sleigh Ride was retired after the 1983 operating season.|$|E
5000|$|The ride had {{elements}} of both a dark ride and a roller coaster. During {{the first part of}} the ride, the sleighs moved through a pine forest, past a towering waterfall, and into the “Der Hofheinzberg” mountain. The second half of the ride took riders through dark tunnels and icy caverns. A waterfall cascaded from atop the mountain and down into a catch pool below. After passing the waterfall, the sleigh themed vehicles entered the mountain's base and traveled through various chambers and tunnels inside. These included an echo-tunnel, an avalanche room with simulated snow, an appearance by an [...] "abominable snowman" [...] character, and a chamber themed with [...] "Alpie" [...] characters, among others. The avalanche room kept cooled down to approximately 10 degrees Fahrenheit and contained an elaborate snow machine. This system was developed for the park by Carrier, the company responsible for Astroworld’s famous “outdoor air conditioning” in the park’s queues and other areas. In the Cold Room were two giant air curtains blowing down onto the track from above, one at the entrance of the room and one at the exit. After passing through the second level inside the mountain, the vehicles would exit and travel around the exterior of the mountain themed show building. Exterior features included the high bridge passing in front of the waterfall and a downhill canyon run. Vehicles were powered by an <b>electrical</b> <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> along sections of track that ascended, and they were gravity powered along the descents which featured several surprise drops.|$|E

40|$|Next to copper, {{aluminium}} alloys {{are widely used}} in electrical industries, because of their high electrical conductivity. AA 6101 -T 6 and AA 1350 {{aluminium alloys}} are widely used in <b>electrical</b> <b>bus</b> <b>bars.</b> As these alloys are joined by mechanical fasteners in <b>electrical</b> <b>bus</b> <b>bars,</b> the conductive area has been reduced. To avoid this problem, they should be joined without removal of metal {{as well as their}} properties. Friction stir welding technique is mainly invented for joining similar and dissimilar aluminium alloys. In this investigation, friction stir welding of AA 6101 -T 6 and AA 1350 aluminium alloys was done by varying tool traversing speed, rotational speed and tilt angle with hexagonal pin profiled tool. The analysis of variance was employed to study the effect of above parameters on mechanical properties of welded joints. From the experimental results, it is observed that welded joint with the combination of 1070  rpm rotating speed, 78  mm/min traversing speed and 2 ° tilt angle provides better mechanical properties. Analysis of variance shows that most significant impact on tensile strength is made by variation in tool rotating speed while tool tilt angle makes the most significant impact on elongation and bending strength.

40|$|In {{power systems}} {{currents}} that usually flow through flat copper or aluminium conductors called <b>bus</b> <b>bars.</b> Therefore, {{there is a}} practical demand for <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> to be employed in current measurement applications. The present investigation, taking into account this practical demand, has as its objective {{the development of a}} cheap and automatic current monitoring system applicable to <b>electrical</b> <b>bus</b> <b>bars.</b> The requirement to develop a low cost system {{is the first step in}} order to obtain a possible future industrial production of this system and it affected the choice of the hardware tools used in this project. The <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> taken into consideration in this project are employed in an electrical LV distribution panel intended for use in the industrial sector. The panel is employed for the supply of four different 3 -phase circuits that provide energy to distinct groups of electrical loads. This automatic system of monitoring has the purpose of measuring the current flowing through every bar with the future goal to check, at any time, electrical information of the electrical system, such as the load curve that denotes every circuit. The application developed in this investigation assumes that the magnetic field around a <b>bus</b> <b>bar,</b> at a certain distance, is proportional to the applied current at all times. Thus, it is possible to find out the electrical information of a <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> by measuring and analysing the emanated magnetic field. In order to analyse the Magnetic field, it has been taken into consideration, principally for the cost-effectiveness, the implementation of a number of Magnetoresistive sensors installed into the panel and supported by an Arduino® board, specially programmed for the case in study. The main develop of the project was realized using a 3 D model of the distribution panel, designed with the support of the Solidworks® software and subsequently implemented in the COMSOL Multiphysics® simulation software for FEM analysis. The use of the FEM simulation software has been fundamental in order to find out the correct position and configuration of the sensors. The main goal obtained with the FEM simulations it was the elimination of the influence of stray MFs in the sensors measures through the setting of an anti-differential configuration of the sensors. At the end of the work it has been reached an advanced level of the project, with the correct functioning of the simulating measurement system and the implementation of an Arduino® algorithm to control the board supported the sensors. The correct functioning of the simulating system was figure out with a graphical study of the measured currents trends, developed in a Matlab® environment. Universidad de Sevilla.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose an algorithm for the determination of the allowable ampacities of single rectangular-section <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> without the occurrence of correction factors. Without correction factors, the ampacity computation of the copper and aluminium <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> is fully automatized. The analytical algorithm has been implemented in a computer program code that along with the allowable ampacity can compute the <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> temperature and the individual heat transfer coefficient for each side of the <b>bus</b> <b>bar,</b> as well as their corresponding power losses. Natural and forced convection correlations for rectangular <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> are applied.

40|$|AbstractWith {{decreasing}} module {{prices on}} the spot market, the cost of silver is {{getting more and more}} important in solar cell fabrication. Silver is necessary for the front side metallization and the rear side <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> metallization in a solar cell. The front side benefits from the good conductivity of silver whereas the rear side <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> need the low oxidation degree and thus the good solderability of this noble metal. We replace silver <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> by a metal paste containing a combination of different metals with a silver content below 40 %. Thus we reach a silver reduction of 30 % compared to conventional rear <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> metal paste. Multi crystalline silicon solar cells with the new paste achieve identical efficiencies compared to cells with silver reference pastes, tested on 150 cells per batch. The new paste simply replaces conventional rear <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> metal pastes and passes the common tests. Reliability tests are in progress at the moment. As a pretest, cells with the paste passed a hot-water test. Losses in efficiency of the cells due to corrosion are comparable to the losses of cells with reference silver paste...|$|R

When the <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> are patterned, they can reflect light {{back onto the}} silicon using total {{internal}} reflection. These patterned <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> are tin plated and produce 1 - 2. 5 % improvement in module efficiency [6]. There is a potential for even greater improvement by using higher reflectivity metal plating on the <b>bus</b> <b>bars.</b> Silver is the most reflective of all metals, but is also very expensive. We tested to see if silver would actually be as reflective as published values and if silver could redirect {{a substantial amount of}} light using total internal reflection. We found that silver plating followed the published spectral dependence curve with little deviation, and would reflect 18. 4 % more light than the published values for tin. Plating 2. 24 microns resulted in 94. 9 % of reflected light undergoing TIR; the most reflected light of any tested material. Finally, given the current cost of silver is $ 430 per kilogram and the variable cost of a solar cell is $ 2 per Watt, the maximum allowable thickness we could afford to plate is 44. 8 microns. In our testing, plating as little as 0. 35 microns produced a very high light capture.
