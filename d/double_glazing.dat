5|$|Thirty-five {{years after}} its opening, Baden-Powell House was {{refurbished}} in a six-month £2million programme, providing all modern amenities such as private facilities for all rooms, <b>double</b> <b>glazing,</b> and air conditioning, as well as enhancing conference facilities for large and small events. Upon completion of the programme, the house was opened {{by the president of}} The Scout Association, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent on 5 June 1997. In 2002 a Starbucks coffee (discontinued before 2015) and sandwich bar was opened, as well as an outdoor roof garden adjacent to the meeting conference rooms on the second floor.|$|E
25|$|Architects promote <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> in {{residential}} houses, which avoids the inefficient {{convection of heat}} across the relatively narrow gap between the panes, but the tower exploits this effect. The shafts pull warm {{air out of the}} building during the summer and warm the building in the winter using passive solar heating. The shafts also allow sunlight to pass through the building, making the work environment more pleasing, and keeping the lighting costs down.|$|E
25|$|In some {{situations}} the insulation is {{in reference to}} noise mitigation. In these circumstances a large air space improves the noise insulation quality or sound transmission class. Asymmetric <b>double</b> <b>glazing,</b> using different thicknesses of glass rather than the conventional symmetrical systems (equal glass thicknesses used for both lights) will improve the acoustic attenuation properties of the IGU. If standard air spaces are used, sulfur hexafluoride {{can be used to}} replace or augment an inert gas and improve acoustical attenuation performance.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{the more}} {{effective}} a fill gas {{is at its}} optimum thickness, the thinner the optimum thickness is. For example, the optimum thickness for krypton is lower than for argon, and lower for argon than for air. However, since {{it is difficult to}} determine whether the gas in an IGU has become mixed with air at time of manufacture (or becomes mixed with air once installed), many designers prefer to use thicker gaps than would be optimum for the fill gas if it were pure. Argon is commonly used in insulated glazing as it is the most affordable. Krypton, which is considerably more expensive, is not generally used except to produce very thin <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> units or extremely high performance triple-glazed units. Xenon has found very little application in IGUs because of cost.|$|E
25|$|The G-1, {{produced}} from February 1942, {{was the first}} production version of the G-series and the first production Bf 109 with a pressurized cockpit. It could be identified by the small, horn-shaped air intake for the cockpit compressor just above the supercharger intake, on the left upper cowling. In addition, the angled armour plate for the pilot's head {{was replaced by a}} vertical piece which sealed-off the rear of the side-hinged cockpit canopy. Small, triangular armour-glass panels were fitted into the upper corners of this armour, although there were aircraft in which the plate was solid steel. Silica gel capsules were placed in each pane of the windscreen and opening canopy to absorb any moisture which may have been trapped in the <b>double</b> <b>glazing.</b> The last 80 G-1s built were lightweight G-1/R2. In these GM-1 nitrous oxide 'boost' was used, and the pilot's back armour was removed, as were all fittings for the long-range drop tank. A few G-1 flown by I./JG 1 are known to have carried the underwing 20mm MG 151/20 cannon gondolas.|$|E
500|$|The {{interior}} {{displays a}} [...] "subtle amalgam of styles", {{testament to the}} number of different designers involved over the years, including William Curtis Green, Oliver Ford, Alberto Pinto and Oliver Messel. Green designed the original interior which is still retained in part. Kim Einhorn believes that this fusion of style was achieved tastefully and has remarked that the Dorchester Hotel is [...] "a good example of somewhere it may be better to add decor rather than completely re-invent". [...] DK Eyewitness describes the Dorchester as [...] "the epitome of the glamorous luxury hotel, with an outrageously lavish lobby and a star-studded history". Rooms include the Grill Room, the Ballroom, the Gold Room, the Crush Hall, the (former) Oriental Restaurant, and the Dorchester Bar. The Ballroom was built to accommodate some 1,000 guests. Thomas Prebensen Steen, in his book Remarkable hotels of Europe, describes the doors of the hotel, [...] "Effectively set off by the ivory walls between the pilasters behind the row of Corinthian columns, the doorways are easily recognised as decorative masterpieces in their own right: dominated by stuccoed, classic pediments decorated with friezes and gilded details, these impressive portals, with either double or single, richly panelled Georgian mahogany doors, make a regal link between the Promenade and Dorchester's renowned, stunning banqueting rooms." [...] Gold leaf and marble remain distinct features of the public rooms of the hotel, including the restaurants, with features more reminiscent of an English country house than a hotel. Considerable efforts to make the rooms soundproof at the Dorchester were made from the outset; the exterior walls were faced with cork, and the floors and ceilings of the bedrooms and suites were lined with compressed seaweed. Following renovation, the hotel was fitted with <b>double</b> <b>glazing,</b> and triple glazing on the Park Lane side to further improve soundproofing.|$|E

2500|$|Insulating glass (IG), more {{commonly}} known as <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> (or double-pane, and increasingly triple glazing/pane), consists {{of two or three}} glass window panes separated by a vacuum or gas filled space to reduce heat transfer across a part of the building envelope.|$|E
2500|$|Additional {{layers of}} glazing provide the {{opportunity}} for improved insulation.

50|$|Hutchinson {{graduated}} from the California Institute of Technology in 1931, and received an M.S. and M.E. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1937. He was a professor of engineering at Berkeley and at Purdue University. At Purdue, he established a solar energy research program in which two experimental solar houses (one with large <b>double</b> <b>glazed</b> windows) were built on the Purdue campus {{in the summer of}} 1945. By analyzing this experiment, Hutchinson concluded that the solar gain through the <b>double</b> <b>glazed</b> house was greater than the excess heat loss. This study led to the manufacture of Thermopane http://www.utoledo.edu/library/canaday/findingaids1/MSS-066.pdf glass in 1946, which is widely used in modern architecture.|$|R
2500|$|The {{building}} uses energy-saving methods, {{which allow}} it to use half the power that a similar tower would typically consume. Gaps in each floor create six shafts that serve as a natural ventilation system for the entire building, even though required firebreaks on every sixth floor interrupt the [...] "chimney". The shafts create a giant <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> effect; air is sandwiched between two layers of glazing and insulates the office space inside.|$|E

2500|$|Modernisation work in {{the early}} 21st century has {{included}} the replacement of all windows with <b>double</b> <b>glazing,</b> a new heating system, rewiring and improvements to the drains. A planning application was made in 2011 to convert some of the landscaped area {{in front of the}} almshouses into a gravel car park for up to ten vehicles. Parking in the area had long been a problem: a [...] "controlled parking zone" [...] was put in place on Northgate Road in 2002, limiting parking to 16 spaces. [...] The almshouses were excluded from this because few residents had cars and Crawley town centre was considered close enough to be accessible: it is [...] away. Subsequently, four parking permits were granted for almshouse residents, and some visitor permits were allocated as well—but this facility was taken away in 2010 because of increasing demand for spaces. Extension of the adjacent Three Bridges controlled parking zone was discussed as an alternative.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{technical}} {{performance of a}} hybrid ‘solar window’ that provides heating in addition to daylighting is evaluated. A wavelength selective film is coupled with a compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) to reflect and concentrate the infrared portion of the solar spectrum onto a tubular absorber while transmitting the visible portion of the spectrum into the interior space. The optical performance of the CPC/selective film is predicted using a Monte Carlo Ray-Tracing model. An adaptive concentrator geometry based on asymmetrical truncation of CPCs is analyzed for vertical windows.
