5|$|The mallard usually feeds by dabbling {{for plant}} food or grazing; {{there are reports}} of it eating frogs. However, in 2017 a flock of mallards in Romania were {{observed}} hunting small migratory birds, including <b>grey</b> <b>wagtail</b> and black redstart, the first documented occasion they had been seen attacking and consuming large vertebrates. It usually nests on a river bank, but not always near water. It is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and forms large flocks, which are known as sords.|$|E
5|$|There are Local Nature Reserves at Wellington Basins on {{the western}} fringe of the town. It {{includes}} a small pond and boardwalk {{with a variety of}} wildlife habitats. The grassland, hedges and woodland are home to a varied flora and fauna including birds such as the <b>grey</b> <b>wagtail,</b> dipper and reed bunting. Five separate bat species have been recorded at the site. Swains Pond in the south of Wellington is another Local Nature Reserve, which used to be the site of orchards. It now includes a pond which provides a home for amphibians including the great crested newt, palmate newt and toads.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} local nature {{reserves}} {{in and around}} Taunton, which are protected under a statutory designation in Section 21 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. South Taunton Streams is an urban wetland, and in the northern suburbs is the Children's Wood riverside reserve which provides a movement corridor for animals including otters {{along the banks of}} the River Tone. Birds occurring at the site include: kingfisher, dipper, <b>grey</b> <b>wagtail,</b> mute swan, grey heron and reed warbler. It is also home to butterflies such as the small and large skipper, marbled white, small heath and small copper, and to dragonflies and damselflies.|$|E

50|$|After {{suffering}} {{many years}} of pollution due to effluent discharge from Whitter's factory and Stanley's factory, the river is now much cleaner, and as such has attracted birds such as dippers, <b>grey</b> <b>wagtails</b> and kingfishers, and fish including trout, chub, Dace and barbel.|$|R
50|$|The stream largely follows {{its natural}} course, {{but most of}} the banks are {{restrained}} by wooden boards, and there is little aquatic vegetation.

6000|$|One winter, a {{few years}} ago, I was staying {{for a few days}} at a cottage facing Silchester Common, and on going out after breakfast to feed the birds I {{particularly}} noticed a male <b>grey</b> <b>wagtail</b> among those that came to me, on account of its beauty and tameness.

60|$|To {{pass from}} little girls to little boys {{is to go}} into quite another, an inferior, coarser world. No doubt there are {{wonderful}} little boys, but as a rule their wonderfulness consists in a precocious intellect: this kind doesn't appeal to me, so that if I were to say anything on the matter, {{it would be a}} prejudiced judgment. Even the ordinary civilised little boy, the nice little gentleman who is as much at home in the drawing-room as at his desk in the school-room or with a bat in the playing-field--even that harmless little person seems somehow unnatural, or denaturalised to my primitive taste. A result, I will have it, of improper treatment. He has been under the tap, too thoroughly scrubbed, boiled, strained and served up with melted butter and a sprig of parsley for ornament in a gilt-edged dish. I prefer him raw, and would rather have the street-Arab, if in town, and the unkempt, rough and tough cottage boy in the country. But take them civilised or natural, those who love and observe little children no more expect to find that peculiar exquisite charm of the girl-child which I have endeavoured to describe in the boy, than they would expect the music of the wood-lark and the airy fairy grace and beauty of the <b>grey</b> <b>wagtail</b> in Philip Sparrow. And yet, incredible as it seems, that very quality of the miraculous little girl is sometimes found in the boy and, with it, strange to say, the boy's proper mind and spirit. The child lover will meet with one of that kind once in ten years, or not so often--not oftener than a collector of butterflies will meet with a Camberwell Beauty. The miraculous little girl, we know, is not more uncommon than the Painted Lady, or White Admiral. And I will here give a picture of such a boy--the child associated in my mind with a spray of southernwood.|$|E

6000|$|To {{some who}} have glanced at a little dusty, out of shape mummy of a bird, {{labelled}} [...] "Dartford Warbler," [...] in a museum, or private collection, or under a glass shade, it may seem that I speak too warmly of the pleasure which {{the sight of the}} small furze-lover can give us. They have never seen it in a state of nature, and probably never will. When I consider all these British Passeres, which, seen at their best, give most delight to the æsthetic sense--the jay, the [...] "British Bird of Paradise," [...] as I have ventured to call it, displaying his vari-coloured feathers at a spring-time gathering; the yellow-green, long-winged wood wren, most aërial and delicate of the woodland warblers; the kingfisher, flashing turquoise blue as he speeds by; the elegant fawn-coloured, black-bearded tit, clinging to the grey-green, swaying reeds, and springing from them with a bell-like note; and the rose-tinted narrow-shaped bottle-tit as he drifts by overhead in a flock; the bright, lively goldfinch scattering the silvery thistle-down on the air; the crossbill, that quaint little many-coloured parrot of the north, feeding on a pine-cone; the <b>grey</b> <b>wagtail</b> exhibiting his graceful motions; and the golden-crested wren, seen suspended motionless with swiftly vibrating wings above his mate concealed among the clustering leaves, in appearance a great green hawk-moth, his opened and flattened crest a shining, flame-coloured disc or shield on his head,--when I consider all these, and others, I find that the peculiar charm of each does not exceed in degree that of the furze wren--seen at his best. He is of the type of the white-throat, but idealised; the familiar brown, excitable Sylvia, pretty as he is and welcome to our hedges in April, is in appearance but a rough study for the smaller, more delicately-fashioned and richly-coloured Melizophilus, or furze-lover. On account of his excessive rarity he can now be seen at his best only by those who are able to spend many days in searching and in watching, who have the patience to sit motionless by the hour; and at length the little hideling, tired of concealment or overcome by curiosity, shows himself and comes nearer and nearer, until the ruby red of the small gem-like eye may been seen without aid to the vision. A sprite-like bird in his slender exquisite shape and his beautiful fits of excitement; fantastic in his motions as he flits and flies from spray to spray, now hovering motionless in the air like the wooing gold-crest, anon dropping on a perch, to sit jerking his long tail, his crest raised, his throat swollen, chiding when he sings and singing when he chides, like a refined and lesser sedge warbler in a frenzy, his slate-black and chestnut-red plumage showing rich and dark against the pure luminous yellow of the massed furze blossoms. It is a sight of fairy-like bird life and of flower which cannot soon be forgotten. And I do not think that any man who has in him any love of nature and of the beautiful can see such a thing, and exist with its image in his mind, and not regard with an extreme bitterness of hatred those among us whose particular craze it is to [...] "collect" [...] such creatures, thereby depriving us and our posterity of the delight the sight of them affords.|$|E
