50|$|<b>Hot-dip</b> <b>galvanized</b> {{surfaces}} are not generally {{tested in a}} salt spray test (see ISO 1461 or ISO 10684). <b>Hot-dip</b> <b>galvanizing</b> produces zinc carbonates when exposed to a natural environment, thus protecting the coating metal and reducing the corrosion rate. The zinc carbonates are not produced when a <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanized</b> specimen is exposed to a salt spray fog, therefore this testing method does not give an accurate measurement of corrosion protection. ISO 9223 gives the guidelines for proper measurement of corrosion resistance for <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanized</b> specimens.|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanized</b> {{steel sheets}} as base {{material}} for laser brazing {{led to the}} formation of spatter and a wavy appearance of the seam. High-speed imaging revealed that spatter formation occurs mainly close to the seam edges. Thermography of the brazing process showed that the type of zinc coating affects the resulting temperature distribution and thereby changes the conditions for the zinc evaporation. Higher temperatures were observed at the seam edges on electro galvanized and phosphated substrates. The cross sections and the process analysis indicate that the zinc evaporation on electro galvanized substrates takes place prior to the wetting with the molten filler material. On the other hand a merely partial evaporation of the zinc coating and the accumulation of zinc at the seam edges takes place during the brazing of <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanized</b> substrates. The formation of spatter is caused by the zinc dissolution and the subsequent evaporation of the zinc rich alloy at the seam edges. The optical properties of the base material are considered to be a crucial factor for the temperature distribution and the resulting zinc evaporation. Brazing trials on <b>hot-dip</b> <b>galvanized</b> and phosphated substrates, which show a reflectance similar to electro galvanized and phosphated specimens, confirm this assumption, as no spatter formation at the seam edge was observed...|$|R
