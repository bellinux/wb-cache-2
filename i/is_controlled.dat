30|$|The above {{analysis}} {{indicates that}} the PP between the terminal points can <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> by adjusting the voltage amplitude and phase angle of each terminal. In addition, the active and reactive power can be decoupled. Ideally, the value of PP should <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> at zero to guarantee the maximum transmission power. The active PP can <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> by arranging the amount of reactive power compensation at the terminal point properly. This contributes to adjusting the voltage amplitude. As for the reactive PP, the phase angle can <b>be</b> <b>controlled</b> by adjusting the unit operation mode at the adjacent areas of terminal points.|$|R

5|$|Each {{chromatophore}} contains pigment of {{only one}} colour. In fish and frogs, colour change is mediated {{by the type of}} chromatophores known as melanophores that contain dark pigment. A melanophore is star-shaped; it contains many small pigmented organelles which can be dispersed throughout the cell, or aggregated near its centre. When the pigmented organelles are dispersed, the cell makes a patch of the animal's skin appear dark; when they are aggregated, most of the cell, and the animal's skin, appears light. In frogs, the change <b>is</b> <b>controlled</b> relatively slowly, mainly by hormones. In fish, the change <b>is</b> <b>controlled</b> by the brain, which sends signals directly to the chromatophores, as well as producing hormones.|$|E

5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} is {{the study}} of the chemical reactions that are catalysed by enzymes.
