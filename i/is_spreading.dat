5|$|B-line. Founded by Bolzano, born 1915. Bolzano's {{less common}} line, {{although}} strong in Austria, is not prevalent elsewhere. The line <b>is</b> <b>spreading</b> nevertheless; the U.S. and several European countries including Great Britain are establishing Bolzano lines.|$|E
5|$|The third {{industrial}} revolution <b>is</b> <b>spreading</b> from {{the developed world}} to some, but not all, parts of the developing world. To participate in this new global economy, developing countries {{must be seen as}} attractive offshore production bases for multinational corporations. To be such bases, developing countries must provide relatively well-educated workforces, good infrastructure (electricity, telecommunications, transportation), political stability, and a willingness to play by market rules.|$|E
5|$|All four {{species have}} {{extensive}} ranges and large populations, {{and the increasing}} use of artificial nest sites has enabled range expansion. The rock martin often breeds in lowland and desert towns, the Eurasian crag martin's range is expanding in Austria, Switzerland, the former Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria, and the dusky crag martin <b>is</b> <b>spreading</b> northeastwards into Guangxi, south into lowland Laos, and westwards to the hills and plains of Sindh. There is also a recent unconfirmed report from Cambodia. Their large ranges and presumed high numbers mean that none of the crag martins are considered to be threatened, and all are classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

25|$|Heartworm {{disease in}} dogs <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> by {{mosquitoes}} and <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> by the parasite Dirofilaria immitis. Signs include cough, difficulty breathing, and death.|$|R
50|$|Polio <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> {{person to}} person through contact with the feces of an {{infected}} person and may <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> through oral and nasal secretions.|$|R
5|$|Out of desperation, Douchebag is told {{to invite}} the girls to play. They agree to join after Douchebag infiltrates an {{abortion}} clinic and travels across Canada to discover which of their friends <b>is</b> <b>spreading</b> gossip. Flanked by the girls, kindergarten pirates, and Star Trek role-players, the humans and elves attack Clyde's dark tower. Randy arrives and reveals that the government agents have planted a nuclear device in Mr. Slave's anus to blow up South Park, forcing Douchebag to shrink and enter Mr. Slave to disarm the bomb. After exiting Mr. Slave, Douchebag finally confronts Clyde and is forced to fight a resurrected Nazi Zombie Chef; Chef is defeated. Clyde decides he is not playing any more and Cartman kicks him from the tower.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is {{surprised}} {{that men have}} been noticing her, instead of resenting or ignoring her as they usually do. Her friend Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells Liz that she is coming off as more confident since starting {{her relationship with her}} boyfriend Carol (Matt Damon). Liz decides to use her new-found confidence to help TGS with Tracy Jordan producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) with a problem he has had with a difficult television editor named Ritchie (Paul Giamatti). Liz visits him in the editing room and hopes to convince him to get TGSs show's opener footage finished as soon as possible in which she is successful after flirting with Ritchie. Later, Liz learns that Ritchie <b>is</b> <b>spreading</b> a rumor that the two are sleeping together. She confronts Ritchie about it, he admits to starting the rumor {{in order to get the}} attention of his assistant editor Donna (Joanna Adler). Later, Liz and Ritchie have a pretend break-up in front of Donna, and Donna becomes interested in Ritchie.|$|E
5|$|New oceanic crust, {{closest to}} the mid-oceanic ridges, is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography. The {{roughness}} of this topography {{is a function of}} the rate at which the mid-ocean ridge <b>is</b> <b>spreading</b> (the spreading rate). Magnitudes of spreading rates vary quite significantly. Typical values for fast-spreading ridges are greater than 100mm/yr, while slow-spreading ridges are typically less than 20mm/yr. Studies have shown that the slower the spreading rate, the rougher the new oceanic crust will be, and vice versa. It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean ridge when the new oceanic crust was formed. These faults pervading the oceanic crust, along with their bounding abyssal hills, are the most common tectonic and topographic features on the surface of the Earth. The process of seafloor spreading helps to explain the concept of continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E
25|$|Internet urban legends are {{folklore}} {{stories that}} <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> through the internet. They may <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> through Usenet or email, or more recently by social media.|$|R
30|$|Both Buddhism and Catholicism <b>were</b> <b>spread</b> {{into many}} {{countries}} {{all over the}} world. Buddhism <b>was</b> <b>spread</b> {{to a number of}} Asian countries such as China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Tibet, Mongolia, and Bhutan to the north, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia to the south. 8 By the nineteenth century, Buddhism was introduced into Europe, Australia, America and then Africa by Western scholars and immigrants. 9 Like Buddhism, Catholicism <b>was</b> <b>spread</b> throughout the Roman Empire and to north Europe through the fourth and fifth centuries. 10 By the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it <b>was</b> <b>spread</b> to America, Asia and Africa.|$|R

25|$|The paper {{concluded}} that HIV/AIDS <b>is</b> <b>spreading</b> {{at different rates}} in the five countries, with the epidemic the most advanced in Nigeria and Ethiopia. In all countries, however, risky sexual behaviors are driving infection rates upward at a precipitous rate.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{the disease}} <b>is</b> <b>spreading</b> to wider circles through {{heterosexual}} transmission in India, {{the movement of}} infected migrant workers in China, and frequent prison amnesty releases {{of large numbers of}} infected prison inmates and rising prostitution in Russia.|$|E
25|$|Cricket {{is now one}} of {{the fastest}} growing sports in Hong Kong. The game <b>is</b> <b>spreading</b> beyond the Sub Continent or English origin {{population}} and many Chinese are also taking up the sport. In a few years it is expected to make some good strides.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 21st century {{redevelopment}} <b>is</b> <b>spreading</b> {{into the more}} suburban parts of East and Southeast London, and into {{the parts of the}} counties of Kent and Essex which abut the Thames Estuary. See Thames Gateway and Lower Lea Valley for further information on this trend.|$|E
25|$|Because {{migratory birds}} {{are among the}} {{carriers}} of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, it <b>is</b> <b>spreading</b> to {{all parts of the}} world. H5N1 is different from all previously known highly pathogenic avian flu viruses in its ability to be spread by animals other than poultry.|$|E
25|$|This {{process is}} not {{restricted}} to Europe. Asia, Japan and the United States are all seeing average age at first birth on the rise, and increasingly the process <b>is</b> <b>spreading</b> to countries {{in the developing world}} like China, Turkey and Iran. In the US, the average age of first childbirth was 25.4 in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Strep throat <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> by {{respiratory}} droplets from {{an infected}} person. It may <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> directly or by touching {{something that has}} droplets on it and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. Some people may carry the bacteria without symptoms. It may also <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> by skin infected with group A strep. The diagnosis is made {{based on the results}} of a rapid antigen detection test or throat culture in those who have symptoms.|$|R
5000|$|Balaghat & Mahadev Hills {{spread on}} the Western borders of {{erstwhile}} Nizam's Dominions'. Balaghat Hills <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> in South Marathwada, North Andhra & North Karnataka Districts. Mahadev Hills <b>are</b> <b>spread</b> in North Karnataka (Belgaum-Bijapur-Raichur) Districts and South Maharashtra.|$|R
25|$|HIV/AIDS {{education}} is somewhat limited in Gaborone. 14.5% of Gaborone residents between 10–64 who {{have heard of}} HIV/AIDS believe that HIV can <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> through witchcraft, and 31.3% of the residents believe HIV can <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> through mosquito bites.|$|R
25|$|Back in the village, Paifu and José {{begin to}} notice {{a strain of}} {{influenza}} that <b>is</b> <b>spreading</b> in the village affecting only the monsters. On their way to school, they are surprised by Arpon, a monster who considers Paifu to be his eternal enemy. The three exchange a few words which led to Arpon challenging Paifu to a sparring match of kung fu.|$|E
25|$|Social distancing, another tactic, {{is staying}} away from other {{people who might be}} infected, and can include {{avoiding}} large gatherings, spreading out a little at work, or perhaps staying home and lying low if an infection <b>is</b> <b>spreading</b> in a community. Public health and other responsible authorities have action plans which may request or require social distancing actions, depending on the severity of the outbreak.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the best}} efforts of {{companies}} to move as much of the construction work as possible out of the Fort McMurray area, and even out of Alberta, the shortage of skilled workers <b>is</b> <b>spreading</b> {{to the rest of the}} province. Even without the oil sands, the Alberta economy would be very strong, but development of the oil sands has resulted in the strongest period of economic growth ever recorded by a Canadian province.|$|E
50|$|Diphtheria is an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheria It <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing, it can also <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> through skin lesions on the infected person and through contact with contaminated clothes and objects.|$|R
50|$|The ancient Ahichchhatra <b>was</b> <b>spread</b> {{in large}} area and its ruins are still found {{around the city}} Ramnagar. According to the Chinese {{traveler}} ‘Hventsang’ this place <b>was</b> <b>spread</b> {{in the area of}} 3 miles and many Stupas were also constructed here.|$|R
50|$|Hepatitis E <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> {{primarily}} through the oral-fecal route {{but may also}} <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> by blood and from mother to fetus. The mainstay of hepatitis E prevention {{is similar to that}} for hepatitis A (namely, good hygiene and clean water practices).|$|R
25|$|She-Hulk {{arrives in}} a post-apocalyptic Manhattan {{and after a}} brief {{encounter}} with more sentinels, she is chased back to Arcadia by the Thor Corps. The Thor Corps follow in pursuit, but Medusa manages to repel {{them back into the}} portal and is killed in the process. When the Thor Corps return, She-Hulk alerts the citizens of Arcadia that there is a traitor in their midst that <b>is</b> <b>spreading</b> discontent and vows to bring them to justice as she and other A-Forcers go into hiding inside the newcomer.|$|E
25|$|While Norway, Germany, Poland and Iceland harboured {{the largest}} {{surviving}} populations, pockets of reproducing pairs remained {{in several other}} countries. Intense conservation actions {{throughout much of the}} remaining European distribution range (legal protection to decrease hunting, protection of breeding sites, and winter feeding) led to recovery of many local populations. Since the 1980s, the European white-tailed eagle population has recovered steadily and <b>is</b> <b>spreading</b> back westward. It has today recolonised several traditional breeding areas in Europe. This ongoing recovery is assisted in Scotland and Ireland by reintroduction schemes.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{photovoltaic}} modules {{have dropped}} about 75 per cent in price. Current {{scientific and technological}} advances in the laboratory suggest that they will soon be so cheap that the principal cost of going solar on residential and commercial buildings will be installation. On-shore wind power <b>is</b> <b>spreading</b> over all continents and is economically competitive with fossil and nuclear power in several regions. Concentrated solar thermal power (CST) with thermal storage has moved from the demonstration stage of maturity to the limited commercial stage and still {{has the potential for}} further cost reductions of about 50 per cent.|$|E

25|$|Group H streptococci cause {{infections in}} {{medium-sized}} canines. Group H streptococci rarely cause illness unless a human has {{direct contact with}} the mouth of a canine. One of the most common ways this can <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> <b>is</b> human-to-canine, mouth-to-mouth contact. However, the canine may lick the human's hand and infection can <b>be</b> <b>spread,</b> as well.|$|R
