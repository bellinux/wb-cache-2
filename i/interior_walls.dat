5|$|The <b>interior</b> <b>walls</b> {{and ceiling}} of the hall were richly decorated, in some cases with gaudy frescoes of the hills and Roman countryside, the Pantheons, {{religious}} themes, the buildings surrounding the area, and naval shipwrecks with Jesus calming the storm and so forth.|$|E
5|$|Doors and vents {{often had}} sills of {{carefully}} ground flat stone slabs and lintels constructed from {{a row of}} thin wood beams. Chacoan masons also frequently included intramural beams – horizontal logs completely enclosed in the wall core – which were probably intended to reduce horizontal deformation of the wall. The <b>interior</b> <b>walls</b> of great houses were typically covered in a rock veneer. Judd identified four distinct types, and his typology is the most commonly accepted in the region. Chetro Ketl's <b>interior</b> <b>walls,</b> particularly those in the eastern wing, were covered in a Type IV veneer characterized by uniform pieces of sandstone with little to no exposed mortar. Judd excluded a fifth type of masonry, called McElmo style, from his typology.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A novel {{diatomite}} {{latex paint}} for <b>interior</b> <b>wall</b> was prepared succesfully. The as-prepared diatomite latex paint for <b>interior</b> <b>wall</b> meets the technical indicators of top quality goods in requirements of top-coat for <b>interior</b> <b>wall</b> (GB/T 9756 - 2009). The rational proportion of pigments and fillers {{is one of}} the key factors to decide the storage stability of latex paint system. The determination of binder ratio should also consider the effect of the emulsion on the microstructure of diatomite surface in the coating. The as-prepared diatomite latex paint for <b>interior</b> <b>wall</b> has versatilities of sound-absorbing, air purification and humidity control. It has a broad prospect of application and development in the fields of the environmentally friendly indoor decoration materials...|$|R

5|$|Located to {{the east}} of the Nanzan Campus is the Divine Word Seminary Chapel (1962). This is a {{building}} that exploits the plastic capacity of concrete, with two intersecting shells forming a bell tower.

5|$|Most of the {{surviving}} frescoes on the church's <b>interior</b> <b>walls</b> date from the 18th century. These include images of the Mother of God, Jesus Christ and John the Baptist, all painted {{as part of the}} church's first reconstruction. However, restoration works carried out in the 2000s have uncovered 14th-century murals depicting the meeting of Elizabeth and Mary as well as John the Baptist.|$|E

5|$|Construction resumed in 1879 {{under the}} {{direction}} of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Lincoln Casey of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Casey redesigned the foundation, strengthening it so it could support a structure that ultimately weighed more than 40,000 tons. The first stone atop the unfinished stump was laid August 7, 1880 in a small ceremony attended by President Rutherford B. Hayes, Casey and a few others. The president placed a small coin on which he had scratched his initials and the date in the bed of wet cement at the 150-foot level before the first stone was laid on top of it. Casey found 92 memorial stones (presented stones) already inlaid into the <b>interior</b> <b>walls</b> of the first phase of construction. Before construction continued he temporarily removed eight stones at the 150-foot level so that the walls at that level could be sloped outward, producing thinner second-phase walls. He inserted those stones and most of the remaining memorial stones stored in the lapidarium into the <b>interior</b> <b>walls</b> during 1885–89. The bottom third of the monument is a slightly lighter shade {{than the rest of the}} construction because the marble was obtained from different quarries.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} room, {{like the}} exterior, is oriented east-west. The most prominent decorative element inside is the hand graining detail {{on the wood}} surfaces. An elevated gallery lines the north wall facing the pews which are bisected by 3½ ft (1.1 m) tall, 5 in (13cm) wide beaded board partition. The pews, partition, door, and window trim are all hand grained. The <b>interior</b> <b>walls</b> are covered with 6 in (15cm) pine wainscotting. The original iron stoves have been replaced with oil-burning stoves, set into the original flues.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} at Dwarka, both {{on shore}} and offshore in the Arabian Sea, {{have been performed}} by the Archaeological Survey of India. The first investigations carried out on land in 1963 revealed many artifacts. Excavations done at two sites on the seaward side of Dwarka brought to light submerged settlements, a large stone-built jetty, and triangular stone anchors with three holes. The settlements are {{in the form of}} exterior and <b>interior</b> <b>walls,</b> and fort bastions. From the typological classification of the anchors it is inferred that Dwarka had flourished as a port during the period of the Middle kingdoms of India. Coastal erosion was probably the cause of the destruction of what was an ancient port.|$|E

5|$|Damage was {{confined}} to Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and south-central Iowa, and largely consisted of fallen chimneys, foundation cracks, collapsed parapets, and overturned tombstones. In one home in Dale, Illinois, near Tuckers Corners and southwest of McLeansboro, the quake cracked <b>interior</b> <b>walls,</b> plaster, and chimneys. Using a type of victim study, the local post office surveyed residents and implemented a field inspection which indicated the strongest shaking (MM VII) {{took place in the}} Wabash Valley, Ohio Valley, and other nearby south-central Illinois lowlands. Outside this four-state zone, oscillating objects including cars, chimneys, and the Gateway Arch were reported to authorities.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, {{the arsenal}} was renamed Little Rock Barracks {{and the main}} {{building}} used as married officers' quarters. The building was drastically altered the inside and outside. Prior to renovation, a rear basement door provided the only entrance, while the tower served as a hoist to move munitions between floors. By 1868, front and rear porches had {{been added to the}} building, as well as <b>interior</b> <b>walls</b> and stairs, some of which remain today, including the central staircase. In 1880, Douglas MacArthur was born on the northwest upper floor of this building while his father, U.S. Army Captain Arthur MacArthur, was stationed there.|$|E
5|$|Inside the church, an {{intricate}} five-tier icon screen funded by Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky and executed by Hryhoryi Petriv from Chernigov {{was installed in}} 1718. During {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, almost all of the original Byzantine mosaics and frescoes on the <b>interior</b> <b>walls</b> were painted over. Some restoration work on the mosaics and frescoes that remained unpainted was carried out {{towards the end of the}} nineteenth century. However, there were no major and serious investigations of the walls done, so it is possible that medieval frescoes or mosaics were preserved under the newer coats of plaster.|$|E

5|$|One poorly studied area of Maya {{folk art}} is graffiti. Additional graffiti, {{not part of}} the planned decoration, was incised into the stucco of <b>interior</b> <b>walls,</b> floors, and benches, {{in a wide variety of}} buildings, {{including}} temples, residences, and storerooms. Graffiti has been recorded at 51 Maya sites, particularly clustered in the Petén Basin and southern Campeche, and the Chenes region of northwestern Yucatán. At Tikal, where a great quantity of graffiti has been recorded, the subject matter includes drawings of temples, people, deities, animals, banners, litters, and thrones. Graffiti was often inscribed haphazardly, with drawings overlapping each other, and display a mix of crude, untrained art, and examples by artists who were familiar with Classic-period artistic conventions.|$|E
5|$|Palmyra {{had a large}} agora. However, {{unlike the}} Greek Agoras (public {{gathering}} places shared with public buildings), Palmyra's agora resembled an Eastern caravanserai more than a hub of public life. The Palmyrenes buried their dead in elaborate family mausoleums, most with <b>interior</b> <b>walls</b> forming rows of burial chambers (loculi) in which the dead, laying at full length, were placed. A relief of the person interred formed part of the wall's decoration, acting as a headstone. Sarcophagi appeared in the late second century and were used {{in some of the}} tombs. Many burial monuments contained mummies embalmed in a method similar to that used in Ancient Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Stela 11 was {{originally}} an interior column from Temple 18, the funerary shrine of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. When it was found, {{it was broken}} in two parts {{at the base of}} the temple. It portrays the king as the elderly Maya maize god and has imagery that seems to deliberately parallel the tomb lid of the Palenque king K'inich Janaab' Pakal, probably because of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat's close family ties to that city. The text of the column formed part of a longer text carved onto the <b>interior</b> <b>walls</b> of the temple and may describe the downfall of the Copán dynasty.|$|E

5|$|The acropolis is also {{distinguished}} {{by a great}} quantity of graffiti inscribed onto the stucco <b>interior</b> <b>walls</b> of its rooms, some of which display a considerable level of artistic skill. The graffiti is believed to date to the last phase of occupation of the acropolis, during the Early Postclassic, and includes local fauna and human figures, {{some of which are}} playing musical instruments. Animals depicted in the graffiti include a deer, a turtle and a frog. Two human figures are depicted playing flutes, while other subjects include pyramid temples, courtly scenes, vulvas and supernatural beings.|$|E
5|$|The {{circular}} keep {{was turned}} into a Martello tower, a type of Napoleonic artillery fortification. It was now only two storeys tall, although remaining original <b>interior</b> <b>walls</b> and doorways largely survived untouched. It was accessed on the first floor via an unusual sliding drawbridge, which was supported on rails and could retract into the floor, and the different storeys were linked by a spiral staircase. The ground floor of the keep included a brick-built magazine, and the roof, supported by a central pillar running up through the building, held a single, large gun emplacement.|$|E
5|$|The {{decoration}} of the elongated {{north and south}} walls includes brick blind arches in the bottom part and a large arch for each wall adjacent to the dome with a columned window in the middle. There are windows above the lower arches of {{the north and south}} facade. The dome, which also exhibits a large number of ornamental details and ceramics, features eight windows, one for each of its sides. The medieval frescoes which were painted on the <b>interior</b> <b>walls</b> of the church have been only fragmentarily preserved.|$|E
