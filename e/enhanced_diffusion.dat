50|$|Water {{is pumped}} into the mantle cavity of the octopus where it comes {{into contact with the}} {{internal}} gills. The water has a high concentration of oxygen compared to the blood returning from the veins, therefore oxygen diffuses into the blood. The tissues and muscles of the octopus use oxygen and release carbon dioxide when breaking down glucose in the Krebs cycle. The carbon dioxide then dissolves into the blood or combines with water to form carbonic acid which decreases blood pH. The Bohr Effect explains why oxygen concentrations are lower in venous blood than arterial blood and why oxygen diffuses into the blood stream. The rate of diffusion is affected by the distance the oxygen has to travel from the water to the blood stream as indicated by Fick’s laws of diffusion. Fick’s laws explain why the gills of the octopus contain many small folds that are highly vascularised. They increase surface area and thus also increase the rate of diffusion. The capillaries that line the folds of the gill epithelium have a very thin tissue barrier (10 µm) which allows for fast, easy diffusion of the oxygen into the blood. In situations where the partial pressure of oxygen in the water is low, diffusion of oxygen into the blood is reduced, Henry’s Law can explain this phenomenon. The law states that at equilibrium the partial pressure of oxygen in water will be equal to that in air; however the concentrations will differ due to the differing solubility. This law explains why Octopus vulgaris has to alter the amount of water cycled through its mantle cavity as the oxygen concentration in water changes. The gills are in direct contact with water - carrying more oxygen than the blood - that has been brought into the mantle cavity of the octopus. Gill capillaries are quite small and abundant which creates an increased surface area that water can come into contact with, thus resulting in <b>enhanced</b> <b>diffusion</b> of oxygen into the blood. There is evidence that lamellae and vessels within the lamellae on the gills contract to aid in propelling blood through the capillaries.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Channel {{smoothing}} is {{an alternative}} to diffusion filtering for robust estimation of image features. Its main advantages are speed, stability with respect to parameter changes, and a simple implementation. However, channel smoothing becomes instable in certain situations, typically for elongated, periodic patterns like for instance fingerprints. As for the diffusion filtering an anisotropic extension is required in these cases. In this paper we introduce a new method for anisotropic channel smoothing which is comparable to coherence <b>enhancing</b> <b>diffusion,</b> but faster and easier to implement. Anisotropic channel smoothing implements an orientation adaptive non-linear filtering scheme as a special case of adaptive channel filtering. The smoothing algorithm is applied to several fingerprint images {{and the results are}} compared to those of coherence <b>enhancing</b> <b>diffusion.</b> ...|$|R

To compare the mechanisms {{a model of the}} transient <b>enhanced</b> <b>diffusion</b> due to migration of the pairs "boron atom - silicon interstitial" was developed. It is supposed that during annealing dissolution of the clusters incorporated boron atoms occurs. During cluster dissolution, a fraction of boron atoms occupies a substitutional position, whereas other atoms become interstitial.

40|$|Transient <b>enhanced</b> <b>diffusion</b> {{of boron}} in SiGe HBTs is studied by {{comparing}} {{measurements of the}} temperature dependence of the collector current with the predictions of 2 D process and device simulations. The collector current is chosen for modelling because it is extremely sensitive to very small amounts of out-diffusion from the SiGe base, and hence provides a rigorous test for {{the accuracy of the}} transient <b>enhanced</b> <b>diffusion</b> models. The SiGe HBT studied incorporates an ion implanted extrinsic base adjacent to the SiGe base, which allows the influence of the implantation damage on the boron diffusion to be studied. The process simulations show that point defects generated by the extrinsic base implant lead to a broadening of the basewidth {{around the perimeter of the}} emitter due to transient <b>enhanced</b> <b>diffusion</b> of boron from the SiGe base. This causes parasitic energy barriers to form, which in the worst case, extend laterally several microns from the edge of the extrinsic base. The electrical effect of the transient <b>enhanced</b> <b>diffusion</b> is a decrease in collector current as the emitter geometry is reduced. Transistors with different emitter geometries and undoped SiGe spacer thicknesses are studied and the collector/base reverse bias is varied to modulate the parasitic energy barrier at the collector/base junction. The trends in the measured collector current are in all cases well predicted by a simplified "plus one" transient <b>enhanced</b> <b>diffusion</b> model...|$|E

40|$|Gradient vector flow (GVF) is an {{important}} external force field for active contour models. Various vector fields based on GVF have been proposed. However, these vector fields are obtained with many iterations and have difficulty in capturing the whole image area. On the other hand, the ability to converge to deep and complex concavity with these vector fields is also needed to improve. In this paper, by analyzing the diffusion equation of GVF, a normalized set is defined and a dynamically normalized constraint of vector fields is used for efficient diffusion, which makes the edge vector diffusing rapidly to the entire image region. In order to improve the ability to converge to concavity, an <b>enhanced</b> <b>diffusion</b> term is integrated into the original energy functional. With the dynamically normalized constraint and <b>enhanced</b> <b>diffusion</b> term, new vector fields of EDGVF (efficient and <b>enhanced</b> <b>diffusion</b> for GVF) and EDNGVF (efficient and <b>enhanced</b> <b>diffusion</b> of NGVF) are obtained.

40|$|A two stream {{model of}} boron {{diffusion}} in silicon has been developed. The model {{is intended for}} simulation of transient <b>enhanced</b> <b>diffusion</b> including redistribution of ion-implanted boron during low temperature annealing. The following mechanisms of boron diffusion were proposed, namely: the mechanism of a long-range migration of nonequilibrium boron interstitials and the mechanism due to the formation, migration, and dissolution of the "impurity atom - silicon self-interstitial" pairs. Based on the model, simulation of the redistribution of boron implanted into silicon substrates for annealing temperatures of 800 and 900 Celsius degrees was carried out. The calculated boron concentration profiles agree well with the experimental data. It was shown that for a temperature of 800 Celsius degrees the transport of impurity atoms occurred due to the long-range migration of nonequilibrium boron interstitials generated during cluster transformation or dissolution. On the other hand, {{it was found that}} at a temperature of 900 Celsius degrees the pair diffusion mechanism played a main role in the significant transient <b>enhanced</b> <b>diffusion.</b> A number of parameters describing the transport of nonequilibrium boron interstitials and transient <b>enhanced</b> <b>diffusion</b> of substitutionally dissolved boron atoms were determined. For example, it was found that at a temperature of 900 Celsius degrees the time-average enhancement of boron diffusion was approximately equal to 44 times.

40|$|We have {{explained}} {{the role of}} fluorine in {{the reduction of the}} self-interstitial population in a preamorphized Si layer under thermal treatment. For this purpose, we have employed a B spike layer grown by molecular-beam epitaxy as a marker for the self-interstitial local concentration. The amorphized samples were implanted with 7 x 10 (12), 7 x 10 (13), or 4 x 10 (14) F/cm(2) at 100 keV, and afterwards recrystallized by solid phase epitaxy. Thermal anneals at 750 or 850 degreesC were performed in order to induce the release of self-interstitials from the end-of-range (EOR) defects and thus provoke the transient <b>enhanced</b> <b>diffusion</b> of B atoms. We have shown that the incorporation of F reduces the B <b>enhanced</b> <b>diffusion</b> in a controlled way, up to its complete suppression.
