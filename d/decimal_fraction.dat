5|$|The Jiuzhang suanshu {{was perhaps}} the most {{groundbreaking}} of the three surviving Han treatises. It is the first known book to feature negative numbers, along with the Bakhshali manuscript (200 CE?– 600 CE?) of India and the book of the Greek mathematician Diophantus (fl. 3rd century) written in about 275 CE. Negative numbers appeared as black counting rods, while positive numbers appeared as red counting rods. Although the decimal system existed in China since the Shang dynasty (c. 1600– c. 1050 BCE), the earliest evidence of a <b>decimal</b> <b>fraction</b> (i.e. the denominator is a power of ten) is an inscription on a standard volume-measuring vessel dated 5 CE and used by the mathematician and astronomer Liu Xin (46 BCE– 23 CE). Yet the first book to feature decimal fractions was the Jiuzhang suanshu, as a means to solve equations and represent measurements. Gaussian elimination, an algorithm used to solve linear equations, was known as the Array Rule in the Jiuzhang suanshu. While the book used continued fractions to find the roots of equations, Liu Hui built on this idea in the 3rd century when he increased the decimals to find the cube root of 1,860,867 (yielding the answer 123), the same method used in the Horner scheme named after William George Horner (1786–1837).|$|E

Nevertheless, recent research suggested that <b>decimal</b> <b>fractions</b> may be represented differently than natural numbers because two number processing effects (i. e., semantic interference and compatibility effects) differed in their size between <b>decimal</b> <b>fractions</b> and natural numbers. In the present study, we examined whether these differences indeed indicate that <b>decimal</b> <b>fractions</b> are represented differently from natural numbers. Therefore, we provided an alternative explanation for the semantic congruity effect, namely a string length congruity effect. Moreover, we suggest that the smaller compatibility effect for <b>decimal</b> <b>fractions</b> compared to natural numbers was driven by differences in processing strategy (sequential vs. parallel). To evaluate this claim, we manipulated the tenth and hundredth digits in a magnitude comparison task with participants' eye movements recorded, while the unit digits remained identical. In addition, we evaluated whether our empirical findings could be simulated by an extended version of our computational model originally developed to simulate magnitude comparisons of two-digit natural numbers. In the eye-tracking study, we found evidence that participants processed <b>decimal</b> <b>fractions</b> more sequentially than natural numbers because of the identical leading digit. Importantly, our model was able {{to account for the}} smaller compatibility effect found for <b>decimal</b> <b>fractions.</b> Moreover, string length congruity was an alternative account for the prolonged reaction times for incongruent decimal pairs.
