It was then necessary to re-file using a new writ invented in the early fourteenth century, called the writ de proprietate probanda - a writ [...] "concerning the proof of ownership".|$|E
50|$|One of {{the oldest}} actions in the royal courts was {{replevin}} which had {{its roots in the}} law of customary courts. Strictly speaking, replevin in its original form was a provisional remedy. Its provision was to procure for the plaintiff the return of chattels taken out of his possession until the right to their possession could be decided by a court of law. No doubt, it was designed to avoid quarrels likely to cause a breach of the peace pending a settlement of the dispute about the right to possession. In other words, the rule of law was beginning to replace that of local force of arms and personal conflict as the resolution of disputes over chattels. The action was in direct succession to the efforts made to regulate self-help, which were the origin of the law of tort. The form of legal recourse was in connection of distress (distractio). This was the practice of taking some chattel from the peasant or underling until some action was performed. In the medieval era the services for which distress could be levied were numerous, since the incidents of tenure were then very numerous. Distress was also leviable as damage feasant. When animals strayed and did damage to a neighbor, they could be retained until the damage was made good. Whether or not the distress was levied for rent or for livestock damage feasant, the owner of the animals could obtain their release by giving “gage and pledge” - a form of security that the damage would be made good. One peculiarity of distraint lay {{in the fact that the}} <b>distrainor</b> did not get any form of legal possession. The goods and chattels were considered to be in the custody of the law. As a result, there was no taking of possession by the <b>distrainor</b> that was unlawful, since no possession was technically inferred.|$|E

During the fourteenth century, after some vacillation by judges, it was held that the plaintiff could elect which remedy he chose when the chattels had been distrained.

In reality, there is little evidence this substitution ever occurred with any frequency, if at all. [...] The rule involved interference with the possession of a chattel by the rightful owner.

5000|$|Distraint or {{distress}} is [...] "the {{seizure of}} someone’s property {{in order to}} obtain payment of rent or other money owed", especially in common law countries. Distraint is the act or process [...] "whereby a person (the <b>distrainor),</b> traditionally even without prior court approval, seizes the personal property of another located upon the distrainor's land in satisfaction of a claim, as a pledge for performance of a duty, or in reparation of an injury." [...] Distraint typically involves the seizure of goods (chattels) belonging to the tenant by the landlord to sell the goods for the payment of the rent. In the past, distress was often carried out without court approval. Today, some kind of court action is usually required, the main exception being certain tax authorities, such as HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom and, in the United States, the Internal Revenue Service—agencies that retain the legal power to levy assets (by either seizure or distraint) without a court order.|$|E
