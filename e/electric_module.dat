40|$|A Hemispherical Resonator Gyro (HRG) is the Coriolis Vibratory Gyro (CVG) that {{measures}} rotation angle or angular velocity using Coriolis force acting the vibrating mass. A HRG {{can be used}} as a rate gyro or integrating gyro without structural modification by simply changing the control scheme. In this paper, differential control algorithms are designed for a 2 -piece HRG. To design a precision controller, the electromechanical modelling and signal processing must be pre-performed accurately. Therefore, the equations of motion for the HRG resonator with switched harmonic excitations are derived with the Duhamel Integral method. Electromechanical modeling of the resonator, <b>electric</b> <b>module</b> and charge amplifier is performed by considering the mode shape of a thin hemispherical shell.

Despite {{the potential benefits of}} marine application due to the permanent heat sink from sea water, no significant studies on this application were to be found. In this study, a test rig has been designed and built to test the performance of the TEG on engine operating points. The TEG device is built from commercially available materials for the sake of possible economical application. Two types of commercial TEM (thermo <b>electric</b> <b>module)</b> have been studied separately on the test rig. The engine data were extracted from a commercial Diesel engine since it shares the same principle in terms of engine efficiency and exhaust with the marine Diesel engine. An open circuit water cooling system is used to replicate the sea water cold source. The characterization tests showed that the silicium-germanium alloys TEM proved a remarkable reliability on all engine operating points, with no significant deterioration of performance even under sever variation in the hot source conditions. The performance of the bismuth-telluride alloys was 100 % better than the first type of TEM but it showed a deterioration in power generation when the air temperature exceeds 300 °C. The temperature distribution on the heat exchange surfaces revealed no useful combination of these two types of TEM with this tube length, since the surface temperature difference between both ends is no more than 10 °C. This study exposed the perspective of use of TEG technology for marine engine exhaust heat recovery.

Solder is used to mount electronic parts, such as resistors and capacitors, on printed-circuit boards in almost all electronic devices. However, since {{in many cases the}} thermal expansion coefficients of electronic parts and PCBs are different, cyclic thermal stress and strain causes solder fatigue and device failure. Especially in the power electronic module and car <b>electric</b> <b>module,</b> the evaluation of thermal fatigue life is important. It is understood that the fatigue life of some electronic devices shows large scatter in the thermal cycle test, even if their design is the same. The dispersion of design factors such as shape, size and material properties of solder joints is thought as one of these reasons. Moreover, in the case of chip components, it is thought that the interacting effect by the structural asymmetry due to the unbalance solder joints would influence reliability. At the same time, the changeover from eutectic Sn-Pb solder to lead-free solder has been driven by environmental concerns. Therefore, it cannot be disregard as the main factor of the reliability evaluation in the solder joints. In this study, how the dispersion of design factors and the interacting effect between the design factors influences the fatigue life in lead-free solder joint was investigated by the analytical approach.

40|$|Barrels are {{discrete}} cytoarchitectonic neurons cluster {{located in}} the layer IV of the somatosensory¦cortex in mice brain. Each barrel is related to a specific whisker located on the mouse snout. The¦whisker-to-barrel pathway {{is a part of}} the somatosensory system that is intensively used to explore¦sensory activation induced plasticity in the cerebral cortex. ¦Different recording methods exist to explore the cortical response induced by whisker deflection in¦the cortex of anesthetized mice. In this work, we used a method called the Single-Unit Analysis by¦which we recorded the extracellular electric signals of a single barrel neuron using a microelectrode. ¦After recording the signal was processed by discriminators to isolate specific neuronal shape (action¦potentials). ¦The objective of this thesis was to familiarize with the barrel cortex recording during whisker¦deflection and its theoretical background and to compare two different ways of discriminating and¦sorting cortical signal, the Waveform Window Discriminator (WWD) or the Spike Shape Discriminator (SSD). ¦WWD is an <b>electric</b> <b>module</b> allowing the selection of specific electric signal shape. A trigger and a¦window potential level are set manually. During measurements, every time the electric signal passes¦through the two levels a dot is generated on time line. It was the method used in previous¦extracellular recording study in the Département de Biologie Cellulaire et de Morphologie (DBCM) in¦Lausanne. ¦SSD is a function provided by the signal analysis software Spike 2 (Cambridge Electronic Design). The¦neuronal signal is discriminated by a complex algorithm allowing the creation of specific templates. ¦Each of these templates is supposed to correspond to a cell response profile. The templates are saved¦as a number of points (62 in this study) and are set for each new cortical location. During¦measurements, every time the cortical recorded signal corresponds to a defined number of templates¦points (60 % in this study) a dot is generated on time line. The advantage of the SSD is that multiple¦templates can be used during a single stimulation, allowing a simultaneous recording of multiple¦signals. ¦It exists different ways to represent data after discrimination and sorting. The most commonly used¦in the Single-Unit Analysis of the barrel cortex are the representation of the time between stimulation¦and the first cell response (the latency), the representation of the Response Magnitude (RM) after¦whisker deflection corrected for spontaneous activity and the representation of the time distribution¦of neuronal spikes on time axis after whisker stimulation (Peri-Stimulus Time Histogram, PSTH). ¦The results show that the RMs and the latencies in layer IV were significantly different between the¦WWD and the SSD discriminated signal. The temporal distribution of the latencies shows that the¦different values were included between 6 and 60 ms with no peak value for SSD while the WWD¦data were all gathered around a peak of 11 ms (corresponding to previous studies). The scattered¦distribution of the latencies recorded with the SSD did not correspond to a cell response. ¦The SSD appears to be a powerful tool for signal sorting but we do not succeed to use it for the¦Single-Unit Analysis extracellular recordings. Further recordings with different SSD templates settings¦and larger sample size may help to show the utility of this tool in Single-Unit Analysis studies...|$|E

40|$|A {{major part}} of the heat {{supplied}} in an IC engine is not realized as work output, but dumped into the atmosphere as waste heat. If this waste heat energy is tapped and converted into usable energy, the overall efficiency of the engine can be improved. The percentage of energy rejected to the environment through exhaust gas which can be potentially recovered is approximately 30 - 40 % of the energy supplied by the fuel depending on engine load. Thermoelectric modules (TEM) which are used as Thermoelectric generators (TEG) are solid state devices that are used to convert thermal energy from a temperature gradient to electrical energy and it works on basic principle of Seebeck effect. This paper demonstrates the potential of thermoelectric generation. A detailed experimental work was carried to study the performance of TEG under various engine operating conditions.
