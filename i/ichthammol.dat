5000|$|Ammonium bituminosulfonate or {{ammonium}} bituminosulphonate (synonyms of <b>ichthammol,</b> CAS# brand name: Ichthyol) is {{a product}} of natural origin obtained in the first step by dry distillation of sulfur-rich oil shale (bituminous schists). By sulfonation of the resulting oil (or purified fractions thereof) and subsequent neutralization with ammonia, <b>Ichthammol</b> results as viscous, water-soluble substance with characteristic bitumen-like odor. It is used in medicine as a treatment for different skin diseases, including eczema and psoriasis (see below). Ointments containing 10% or 20% <b>Ichthammol</b> are most common. They are sometimes called [...] "black ointments" [...] or [...] "drawing salves". Ichthammol's dermatological action was promoted by German physician Paul Gerson Unna.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ichthammol</b> is {{available}} in pharmacies for compounding medications. Different sources of information exist for exemplary formulations (creams, shake lotions, suppositories, etc.). According to the [...] "list of preferred Specials" [...] by the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) <b>Ichthammol</b> {{can be used in}} dermatology prescribing to treat acutely inflamed atopic eczema, among others. A corresponding recommendation exists for bituminosulfonates in Germany. According to “guideline atopic eczema” bituminosulfonates can be considered for treatment of atopic eczema based on general clinic experience.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ichthammol</b> is {{also used}} in {{veterinary}} medicine for its bacteriostatic properties {{for the treatment of}} inflammatory skin disorders of horses. Other products containing silver and tea tree oil or triclosan associated with 2 humectants monopropylene glycol and isopropanol are also available.|$|E
50|$|Materials made in China (Pinyin transcription: yushizhi and yushizhi ruangao) {{and offered}} outside China as <b>Ichthammol</b> or Ammonium Bituminosulfonate {{are not in}} line with the {{definition}} given for this substance in the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) or European Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Eur). Also, there is no conformity with the definition as connected to CAS# 8029-68-3. The Chinese material is derived from vegetable oils (e.g. soybean oil) instead of bituminous schists as required. As a result, its chemical basis is totally different from the one of <b>Ichthammol</b> USP/Ph.Eur./CAS# 8029-68-3. The characteristic bitumen-like odor (originating from the bituminous source material) is missing with Chinese material and thereby the original qualities according to common standards can be identified without doubt.|$|E
50|$|In otology, {{a mixture}} of {{glycerol}} and <b>ichthammol</b> (G & I) {{is used for the}} topical treatment of ear infections. It is effective against Gram-positive organisms. The anti-inflammatory action is explained by its influence on the formation, secretion, and effect of inflammation mediators.|$|E
50|$|Bituminosulfonates are {{classified}} as local therapeutic agents with very good tolerability. Pharmacologically, <b>Ichthammol</b> has anti-inflammatory, bactericidal, and fungicidal properties. It is used to treat eczema, psoriasis, Acne rosacea and acne, and it decreases microorganisms in the area surrounding a skin condition. It is commonly used in 10% or 20% concentrate ointment, applied topically.|$|E
5000|$|Black Ointment, or Ichthyol Salve, {{also called}} Drawing Salve has been {{traditionally}} {{used to treat}} minor skin problems such as sebaceous cysts, boils, ingrown toenails and splinters. The main ingredients are often <b>ichthammol,</b> phenyl alcohol, or arnica montana, and may contain herbs such as echinacea or calendula. The name comes from archaic belief that an irritant can [...] "draw out" [...] evil humors.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{depends on}} many factors, {{such as the}} age of horse, {{severity}} of symptoms and duration of infection. As long a horse is eating and drinking, the infection must run its course, much like a common cold virus. Over time a horse will build up enough antibodies to overtake and fight the disease. Other treatment options can be applying heat packs to abscesses to help draw it {{to the surface and}} using drawing salves such as <b>Ichthammol.</b> A blood test or bacterial cultures can be taken to confirm the horse is fighting Pigeon Fever. Anti-inflammatory such as phenylbutazone can be used to ease pain and help control swelling. Treating Pigeon Fever with antibiotics is not normally recommended for external abscesses since it is a strong bacterium that takes extended treatment to kill off and to ensure it does not return stronger. However, if the abscesses are internal then antibiotics may be needed. Consulting a veterinarian for treatment is recommended. Making the horse comfortable, ensuring the horse has good food supply and quality hay will help the horse keep their immune system strong to fight off the infection. Once the abscess breaks or pops, it will drain for a week or two. During this time keeping the area clean, applying hot packs or drawing salves will help remove the pus that has gathered in the abscess.|$|E
40|$|Background. Application {{of various}} {{technological}} {{procedures for the}} manufacture of officinal preparation ointment against chilblains (Unguentum contra perniones) produce essential variations in the quality and stability of the final product. Changing the sequence of admixing active substances into the ointment base indicated the presence of incompatibility between the active substances, {{as well as between}} the active substances and the ointment base components. The aim was to examine the influence of various technological manufacturing procedures on quality and stability of the preparation. Methods. Changes in the samples of ointments and aqueous solutions of active substances were analyzed microscopically. Results. Microscopic analysis of hydrosoluble active substance solutions demonstrated destruction of <b>ichthammol,</b> induced by an acidic medium due to the dissolution of tannin and resorcinol, which is well known from the literature. It also demonstrated the destruction of tannin and resorcinol in aqueous solution, which had not been described in the literature. Application of the prescribed procedure for the manufacturing of ointment against chilblains, conceals the incompatibility reactions due to a slow dissolution of the tannin suspended in the officinal ointment base Unguentum cera lanae. Admixture of an ready-made aqueous solution of tannin caused an instant contact between <b>ichthammol</b> and the acidic medium, which caused the destruction or the complete absence of the formation of emulsion droplets. The problem of incompatibility reactions between lanolin alcohols in the ointment base and <b>ichthammol</b> and resorcinol, as well as the reaction between Peruvian balsam and sulfur from the <b>ichthammol</b> sulfate ion was observed. Numerous incompatibility reactions of ointment against chilblains, components indicated that it was necessary to introduce alterations in both the qualitative and quantitative composition of the preparation. Conclusion. Excipient preparation procedure, as well as the technological procedure for incorporation of active ingredients can cause the incompatibilities and therefore the formulation stability problems...|$|E
40|$|We {{intended}} {{to develop a}} desired ointment for treatment of fungal infection like eczema itching, pruritis. Main objective {{of this study is}} to formulate the ointment with different ointment bases having good consistency, better diffusion, and antifungal and antiseptic properties. Combination of clotrimazole and <b>ichthammol</b> is good for treatment of infection caused by coryne bacteria and also used for skin infection as clotrimazole and <b>ichthammol</b> having antifungal and antiseptic properties respectively. To assess the efficacy of formulations assay, drug release, uniformity, viscosity, diffusivity, rheology, stability, spread ability, permeability and other physical characteristics were evaluated. Two Formulations, formulation A and B were prepared with same active ingredients except different bases. Formulation A contains white soft paraffin and cetostearyl alcohol while B contains hard paraffin, cetostearyl alcohol, Light liquid paraffin and microcrystalline wax. Formulation B was found better than formulation A in all aspects like spreadability, viscosity, consistency, stability, diffusibility etc...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether serum soluble interleukin 2 receptor concentrations {{are related to}} disease activity in atopic eczema. DESIGN [...] Single cohort longitudinal study with controls. SETTING [...] Outpatient and general medicine departments in secondary referral centre. PATIENTS [...] Of 15 patients aged 17 - 57 with severe atopic eczema, all with acute exacerbations of disease, 13 were admitted to hospital and two treated as outpatients until the skin lesions had resolved or greatly improved. Nineteen controls gave single blood samples. INTERVENTIONS [...] Daily skin dressing with betamethasone valerate (0. 025 %) and <b>ichthammol</b> paste and tubular dressings. END POINT [...] Resolution of or considerable improvement in skin lesions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to measure serum soluble interleukin 2 receptor concentrations in blood samples taken on admission, at intervals subsequently, and on discharge. Clinical scores of disease activity were also made. Median concentrations on admission were significantly higher (770 U/ml) in the patients than the controls (300 U/ml). Concentrations fell significantly during treatment. In 25 assessments made at different times in 13 patients serum soluble interleukin 2 receptor concentration correlated significantly (R = 0. 73) with clinical disease activity. CONCLUSIONS [...] Cellular immunopathogenic mechanisms contribute to atopic eczema. Immune activation {{can be measured in}} atopic eczema by measurements of soluble interleukin 2 receptor, and this should facilitate assessment of response to treatment...|$|E
40|$|To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of treatment between steroid–antibiotic and 10 % <b>Ichthammol</b> glycerine packs (IG packs) in acute otitis externa. A prospective, randomized clinical trial between steroid–antibiotic and 10 % IG pack which was performed in department of ENT-HNS, Kathmandu University Hospital, Dhulikhel from July 2009 to December 2009 on 82 patients. Pain was assessed by Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and edema was assessed by dividing {{the external auditory canal}} in four quadrant giving score of 25 % for each on the day of presentation and subsequent visits till tragal tenderness and edema subsided. Age group among studied patients ranged from 10 to 60  years, with mean of 23. 5  years. Out of which 42 (51. 2 %) were females and 40 (48. 8 %) were males. Average number of visits in 10 % IG pack group (n =  41) was 5. 4  days (2 – 5 visits) while in steroid–antibiotic group (n =  41) it was 3. 5  days (2 – 5 visits). There was statistically significant {{decrease in the number of}} visits in steroid group (P <  0. 05). Similarly, decrease in pain score in second visit was statistically significant (P =  0. 02) in steroid–antibiotic group as compared to 10 % IG pack, while the edema score in second visit while comparing steroid–antibiotic group with 10 % IG pack was statistically not significant (P =  0. 07), whereas it was statistically highly significant on fourth visit (P =  0. 001). Since the control of pain and edema is more and hence the number of visits is significantly less in steroid–antibiotic packing group, so it is worthwhile to use steroid–antibiotic pack for effective treatment of acute otitis externa...|$|E
40|$|With a view {{to explore}} and make a {{comparative}} study of various drugs as regards their activity in liberating skin histamine a quantitative determination method of in vitro histamine release from chopped dog skin has been devised and {{a study on the}} conditions influencing histamine release has been carried out. Abdominal skin was removed from dog and cut in a fixed thickness by a chopper of my own contrivance, consisting of razor blades placed at given spaces and after eliminating the majority of histamine spontaneously diffused out by immersing in Tyrode solution, the skin pieces were shaked in a glass tube containing drug solution to be tested along with a glass bead for one hour at 37 °C, and then the histamine content diffusing out in the drug solution and residual histamine in the tissue were determined separately. The histamine releasing activity of drugs depends on the thickness of tissue pieces, temperature, and pH of the solution. In the case of thinner tissue pieces the rate of histamine release either by releaser solution or of spontaneous release proved to be greater. Below 45 °C, the rise in temperature enhanced the release by a releaser more markedly than spontaneous release. At 60 °C, however, all histamine in tissues diffused out within 60 minutes in the Tyrode solution not containing releaser. In the isotonic buffer solution of pH 6 - 8 spontaneous release proved to be least, while at the pH either more acidic or basic the rate of release increased. On the alkaline side the effect of releaser of alkaloid salt increased to a greater degree than spontaneous release. This fact suggests that the penetration of alkaloids into the cell wall takes place readily in the form of base. When the tissue is acted upon by the Tyrode solution or by 0. 9 % saline solution of 78 drugs tested, at 37 °C for 60 minutes, these listed in the following released histamine from chopped skin rather markedly: Sinomenine, quinine, quinidine, cinchonine, cinchonidine, optochine, quinoline, ethylmorphine, thebaine, dibucaine, tropacocaine, betaeucaine, sod. cholate, sod. taurocholate, sod. desoxycholate, Irgapyrine, dibenamine, Priscol, jalapa resin, ethylalcohol, acetone. HgCl(2), phenol, thymol, alkylresorcinol, oil of sinapis, oil of chenopodium and <b>ichthammol.</b> On the other hand, salicylic acid, acetylsalicylic acid and cocaine·HCl, under acidic condition, rather suppressed spontaneous release of histamine. The rates of histamine release from dog skin shown by these drugs were found on the whole to be higher than those obtained by Kamimura (Folia pharmacol. japon., 53, 836, 1957) of our laboratory using guinea-pig lung tissues. On the basis of these findings, the significance of histamine release in relation to symptoms of the so-called drug allergy or in the known pharmacological actions of certain drugs were discussed...|$|E
