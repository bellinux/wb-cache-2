The main objective is to ensure a good behavior of the closed-loop system in the presence of faults and disturbances. To this aim, a global active methodology is defined in order to synthesize an additive optimal control input from fault detection and isolation results. More precisely, a robust residual is firstly generated by means of usual parity relations to detect and isolate faults on the system. Next, a fault accommodation procedure, based model following control scheme, is used to generate an additive control input according to the residual characteristics.

40|$|As {{engineering}} {{problems are}} becoming more and more advanced, the size of an average model solved by partial differential equations is rapidly growing and, in order to keep simulation times within reasonable bounds, both faster computers and more efficient software implementations are needed. In the first part of this thesis, the full potential of simulation software has been exploited through high performance parallel computing techniques. In particular, the simulation of induction heating processes is accomplished within reasonable solution times, by implementing different parallel direct solvers for large sparse linear system, in the solution process of a commercial software. The performance of such library on shared memory systems has been remarkably improved by implementing a multithreaded version of MUMPS (MUltifrontal Massively Parallel Solver) library, which have been tested on benchmark matrices arising from typical induction heating process simulations. A new multithreading approach and a low rank approximation technique have been implemented and developed by MUMPS team in Lyon and Toulouse. In the context of a collaboration between MUMPS team and DII-University of Padova, a preliminary version of such functionalities could be tested on induction <b>heating</b> <b>benchmark</b> problems, and a substantial reduction of the computational cost and memory requirements could be achieved. In the second part of this thesis, some examples of design methodology by virtual prototyping have been described. Complex multiphysics simulations involving electromagnetic, circuital, thermal and mechanical problems have been performed by exploiting parallel solvers, as developed in the first part of this thesis. Finally, multiobjective stochastic optimization algorithms have been applied to multiphysics 3 D model simulations in search of a set of improved induction heating device configurations. ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} an illustrative {{application of the}} Second-Order Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis Methodology (2 nd-ASAM) developed by Cacuci (2015) to a paradigm nonlinear <b>heat</b> conduction <b>benchmark,</b> which models a conceptual experimental test section containing heated rods immersed in liquid lead-bismuth eutectic. This benchmark admits an exact solution, thereby making transparent the underlying mathematical derivations. For this illustrative problem, six large-scale adjoint computations sufficed to compute exactly all five 1 st-order and fifteen distinct 2 nd-order derivatives of the temperature response to the five model parameters. Very significantly, only the sources on the right-sides of the heat conduction differential operator need to be modified; the left-side of the differential equations (and hence the solver in large-scale practical applications) remains unchanged.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of Fault Tolerant Control (FTC) is to {{preserve}} {{the ability of the}} system to reach performances {{as close as possible to}} those which were initially assigned to it. The main goal of this paper consists in the development of a FTC strategy, based on both reliability and life cost of components. Once a fault has been detected and isolated and when it is not possible to reach the nominal performances of the system, the reconfiguration task proposed in this paper needs to find all possible structures of system that preserve pre-specified performances, calculate the system reliabilities and costs for all structures and finally search the optimal structure that has a highest reliability and/or a lowest cost.

40|$|International audienceIn highly {{automated}} aerospace {{and industrial}} systems where {{maintenance and repair}} cannot be carried out immediately, {{it is crucial to}} design control systems capable of ensuring desired performance when taking into account the occurrence of faults/failures on a plant/process; such a control technique is referred to as fault tolerant control (FTC). The control system processing such fault tolerance capability is referred to as a fault tolerant control system (FTCS). The objective of FTC is to maintain system stability and current performance of the system close to the desired performance in the presence of system component and/or instrument faults; in certain circumstances a reduced performance may be acceptable. Various control design methods have been developed in the literature with the target to modify or accommodate baseline controllers which were originally designed for systems operating under fault-free conditions. The main objective {{of this article is to}} develop a novel FTCS design method, which incorporates both reliability and dynamic performance of the faulty system in the design of a FTCS. Once a fault has been detected and isolated, the reconfiguration strategy proposed in this article will find possible structures of the faulty system that best preserve pre-specified performances based on on-line calculated system reliability and associated costs. The new reconfigured controller gains will also be synthesised and finally the optimal structure that has the 'best' control performance with the highest reliability will be chosen for control reconfiguration.

The radiative surface heat transfer rates from the present approach match the benchmark values within 6 %.

40|$|Turbulent CFD {{codes are}} {{assessed}} for {{the prediction of}} convective heat transfer rates at turbulent, hypersonic conditions. Algebraic turbulence models are used within the DPLR and LAURA CFD codes. The <b>benchmark</b> <b>heat</b> transfer rates are derived from thermocouple measurements of the Space Shuttle orbiter Discovery windward tiles during the STS- 119 and STS- 128 entries. The thermocouples were located underneath the reaction-cured glass coating on the thermal protection tiles. Boundary layer transition flight experiments conducted during both of those entries promoted turbulent flow at unusually high Mach numbers, with the present analysis considering Mach 10 { 15. Similar prior comparisons of CFD predictions directly to the flight temperature measurements were unsatisfactory, showing diverging trends between prediction and measurement for Mach numbers greater than 11. In the prior work, surface temperatures and convective heat transfer rates had been assumed to be in radiative equilibrium. The present work employs a one-dimensional time-accurate conduction analysis to relate measured temperatures to surface heat transfer rates, removing heat soak lag from the flight data, {{in order to better}} assess the predictive accuracy of the numerical models. The turbulent CFD shows good agreement for turbulent fuselage flow up to Mach 13. But on the wing {{in the wake of the}} boundary layer trip, the inclusion of tile conduction effects does not explain the prior observed discrepancy in trends between simulation and experiment; the flight heat transfer measurements are roughly constant over Mach 11 - 15, versus an increasing trend with Mach number from the CFD...|$|R

"July 2012 "Molybdenum- 99 diagnostic imaging is the most commonly practiced procedure in nuclear medicine today with the majority molybdenum- 99 produced with proliferation sensitive HEU. International and domestic efforts to develop non-HEU production techniques have taking the first steps toward establishing a new non-HEU molybdenum- 99 based supply chain. The focus of the research presented in this work is on the analysis of a new high U- 235 density LEU based molybdenum- 99 production target. Converting directly to LEU using current manufacturing techniques greatly reduces the molybdenum- 99 yield per target making high volume production uneconomical. The LEU based foil target analyzed in this research increases the yield per target making economic high volume production with LEU possible. The research analyzed the thermal-mechanical response of an LEU foil target during irradiation. Thermal-mechanical studies focused on deflections and stresses to assess the probability of target failure. Simpler analytical models were used to determine the proper shape of the target and to benchmark the numerical modeling software. Numerical studies using Abaqus focused on analyzing various heating and cooling conditions and assessing the effects of curvature on the target. Finally, experiments were performed to simulate low power <b>heating</b> and further <b>benchmark</b> the models.

40|$|Many image {{processing}} and simulation tasks are naturally {{expressed as a}} pipeline of small computational kernels known as stencils. Halide is a popular domain-specific language and compiler designed to implement stencil algorithms. Halide uses simple language constructs to express what to compute and a separate scheduling co-language for expressing how to perform the computation. This approach has demonstrated performance comparable to or better than hand-optimized code. Until now, Halide has been restricted to parallel shared memory execution, limiting its performance and applicability to tomorrow's terapixel {{image processing}} tasks. In this thesis we present an extension to Halide to support distributed-memory parallel execution of stencil pipelines. These extensions compose with the existing scheduling constructs in Halide, allowing expression of complex computation and communication strategies. Existing Halide applications can be distributed with minimal changes, allowing programmers to explore the tradeoff between recomputation and communication with little effort. Approximately 10 new of lines code are needed even for a 200 line, 99 stage application. On nine image processing benchmarks, my extensions give up to a 1. 4 speedup on {{the same number of}} cores over regular multithreaded execution by mitigating the effects of non-uniform memory access. The image processing benchmarks achieve up to 18 speedup on a 16 node testing machine and up to 57 speedup on 64 nodes of the NERSC Cori supercomputer. A 3 D <b>heat</b> finite-difference simulation <b>benchmark</b> achieves linear scaling from 64 to 512 Cori nodes on a 10, 0003, or 1 terapixel, input.

40|$|The present {{thesis is}} the product of three years of {{research}} in the field on magnetically confined nuclear fusion, that has the ultimate goal of demonstrating the possibility of obtaining clean energy from fusion of light nuclei. One of the current problems in this field deals with the interaction between the plasma and the wall of the containing device. Heat and particle fluxes impinging on the first wall can damage the machine structure and, on the other hand, particles expelled by plasma facing materials can degradate the performance and threat the very goal of reaching controlled fusion. The activity carried out during the Ph. D. concerned the study of plasma-wall interactions, focusing on three main topics. The first was a numerical study of advanced magnetic configurations to mitigate heat load and power density deposited on the divertor plates of FAST, a tokamak proposed as a satellite experiment for ITER. The following activity has ben done at RFX-mod, a Reversed-Field Pinch magnetic confinement experiment located in Padova, Italy. The plasma interaction with tungsten covered samples has been studied to investigate the properties of the material for its possible employment in a machine upgrade. As last activity, heat fluxes of the plasma edge have been measured through the instertion of graphite samples in limiter configuration, measuring the heat decay length {{for the first time in}} an RFP. The work is organized as follows. Chapter 1 gives a general introduction to fusion plasmas, magnetic confinement and main toroidal configurations studied. A short presentation of RFX-mod is given along with a quick glance to ITER. Chapter 2 gives a more detailed introduction to the topic of plasma edge, introducing concepts that are at the basis of the work presented later, as the divertor and the limiter configuration. Physical phenomena as recycling and superthermal electrons are also introduced here. Chapter 3 describes numerical simulations in the framework of preliminary studies for the proposed FAST tokamak. A quasi-snowflake divertor configuration has been studied and compared against a standard divertor using the EDGE 2 D/EIRENE code. Chapter 4 presents experimental measurements of surface properties of tungsten covered and full graphite samples. The activity was carried out at RFX-mod with a fast visible camera that measured the samples interactions with the plasma and a comparative analysis has been performed. Chapter 5 describes the investigation of heat flux properties of the plasma edge of the RFP through graphite samples inserted as limiters in the RFX-mod plasma. The measured temperature has been converted to heat flux with two software tools, that have been <b>benchmarked.</b> <b>Heat</b> fluxes and the measured heat decay length have been analyzed and correlated with plasma parameters.
