50|$|Pasteur {{pipettes}} are {{plastic or}} glass pipettes used to transfer {{small amounts of}} liquids, but are not graduated or calibrated for any particular volume. The bulb is separate from the pipette body. Pasteur pipettes are also called teat pipettes, <b>droppers,</b> <b>eye</b> <b>droppers</b> and chemical droppers. The proper handling of the pipettes is by holding the rubber bulb between the {{thumb and index finger}} and controlling the glass by holding it between the ring finger and the pinky. The middle finger is not used.|$|R

50|$|Adele’s father, Jerome Diamond, {{was born}} in 1903 in the Catskills of New York. His was the first Jewish family in Monticello, NY. In the early years they were met with signs {{everywhere}} that said, “No jews and dogs allowed.” He attended a one-room schoolhouse and left school {{to help in the}} family grocery business. He died as Adele was entering her senior year in high school. Adele’s mother, Mildred Golden, weighed 2 pounds when she {{was born in}} 1916 in New York City. She was placed in a small egg box, put in the oven (to keep her warm), and fed with an <b>eye</b> <b>dropper.</b> She attended Tilden High School in Brooklyn and would have attended college if not for the Great Depression, but instead became the bookkeeper for the family business, “Golden Pickle Works.” She died in 1997.|$|E
50|$|Pasteur pipettes, {{also known}} as <b>droppers</b> or <b>eye</b> <b>droppers,</b> are used to {{transfer}} small quantities of liquids. They are usually glass tubes tapered to a narrow point, and fitted with a rubber bulb at the top. The combination of the Pasteur pipette and rubber bulb has also {{been referred to as}} a teat pipette. Pasteur pipettes come in various lengths and are sold in boxes of hundreds. They are named after the French scientist Louis Pasteur, who was known to have used a variant of them extensively during his research. The purpose of Pasteur pipette is invented as in laboratory, the sterile condition of samples is the most concerned. In the past, there is no equipment to transfer a chemical solution without exposing to the external environment. The hygiene and purity of chemical compounds is necessary for the expected result of each experiment. The pasteur pipette both glass and plastic types are sterilized and plugs with rubber bulb at the open end of the pipette preventing the contamination from the atmosphere. Generally, they are considered cheap enough to be disposable, however, so long as the glass point is not chipped, the Pasteur pipette may be washed and reused indefinitely.|$|R
40|$|Medical {{technology}} industry {{which produces}} {{the whole range}} of medical devices from <b>eye</b> <b>droppers</b> to computer tomography scanners is characterized by serious learning problems of industry stakeholders due to its high technological complexity and product diversity. Majority of firms populating the sector are small companies with no revenues, and therefore, depending strongly on venture capital to get their products on the market. At the same time due to technologies which are successfully launched, this industry employs highly qualified staff, promotes jobs and tax revenues. The industry progress is fueled by process of incremental innovation which occasionally produces technological breakthroughs. Medical device regulations, i. e. the mechanism of granting by a state to a manufacturer the rights to market her products in return of proof of their safety and effectiveness/performance, are an important element of innovation ecosystem of medical technology industry. They serve as a tool for decreasing uncertainty of stakeholders’ interactions on the market, ensuring public safety and legitimacy for manufacturers and their products. Supportive medical device regulations improve the investment climate in the industry by reducing related risks, and, hence, contribute to promotion of innovation in the short run and better and cheaper healthcare in the long run. In the regional context, therefore, particular design of medical devise regulations can be a source of competitive advantage of the whole region in the international arena. The present study compares two dominant regulatory frameworks: American and European. It attempts to answer the question: Which specific features of national/regional medical device regulations contribute to sustaining or improvement of a current and future position of a country/region on a world leadership chart? The two approaches are studied at present as well as in dynamics, the parameters determining the regulatory approach success are pointed out and then specific traits of regulatory approaches underpinning success parameters are defined and conjectures are made regarding the future trends of development for each of the two approaches. It has been shown that US and EU regulatory frameworks are likely to ensure similarly high safety level of devices, while European approach seems to be more efficient. Such traits of European framework as use of international performance standards and diversified responsibility among actors involved into regulatory process contribute to its higher efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Dávkování viskózních očních kapek Jana Zimmelová Summary The {{objective}} of this thesis was to study the factors affecting the viscous eye drops dosage. The influence of the effective dropper tip perimeter, surface tension and viscosity of the liquid, and the dispensing angle upon the weight of drop was studied at four commercial ophthalmic preparations containing various viscolyzers, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and xyloglucan, and benzalkonium chloride as an antimicrobial preservative. The weight of a drop was directly proportional to {{the diameter of the}} outer perimeter of the dropper tip and the liquid surface tension. No significant influence of viscosity upon the weight of drops was discovered. The weight of drops decreased when the dispensing angle was reduced from 90 ř to 45 ř except of the situation when the drop slided down the external lateral surface of the dropper tip and consenquently increased its weight. That was observed for the <b>eye</b> <b>dropper</b> Ursapharm. Minimum failures of drop dispensing with low variability of the weight of drops at both investigated dispensing angles have been found for <b>eye</b> <b>dropper</b> Johnson & Johnson (eye drops Visine - tired eyes). Thus, this <b>eye</b> <b>dropper</b> could be recommended for dispensing of viscous eye drops...|$|E

Methods: <b>Eye</b> <b>dropper</b> bottle models, solution models (filtrate water/surfactant solution) and a dispensing time measuring apparatus were prepared to measure the dispensing time. Results: With filtrate water and pressure thrust load of 0. 3 MPa, the dispensing time significantly increased from 1. 1 &plusmn; 0. 5 seconds to 4. 6 &plusmn; 1. 1 seconds depending on the decrease of inner aperture diameters from 0. 4 mm to 0. 2 mm (P &lt; 0. 0001). When using the bottle models with inner aperture diameters of 0. 4 mm or larger, the dispensing time became constant. The dispensing time using surfactant solution showed the same tendency as above. When pressure thrust load was large (0. 07 MPa), the solution flew out continuously with inner aperture diameters of 0. 4 mm or larger and the dispensing time could not be measured. The inner aperture diameter most strongly explained the variation of the dispensing time in both the content solutions in the multiple linear regression analysis (filtrate water: 46 %, R 2 = 0. 462, surfactant solution: 56 %, R 2 = 0. 563). Conclusions: Among content solutions and container structures, the dispensing time was mostly influenced by the diameter of the inner aperture of bottles.

40|$|Phrasal constructs, the lexicon, and {{multilingual}} generation The lexicon {{is normally}} {{conceived of as}} the repository of word-specific information. Traditional lexical resources, such as machine readable dictionaries, therefore contain lists of words. These lists might delineate senses of a word, represent {{the meaning of a}} word, or specify the syntactic frames in which a word can appear, but the level of granularity with which they are concerned is the individual word. There are many linguistic phenomena which pose a challenge to this ”word focus ” in the lexicon. The incorporation of elements at a higher level of abstraction — at the phrasal level, where particular words are grouped together into fixed phrases — provides a basis for improved computational processing of language. In this talk, I will examine the phrasal lexicon and discuss its utility in the context of multilingual text generation. It comes as no surprise to any student of language that text analysis at the level of individual words ignores many important components of language (Becker 1975, inter alia). To list but a few examples, languages contain idioms (e. g. to kick the bucket), fixed expressions (e. g. by and large, to boldly go), phrasal proper nouns (e. g. The Big Apple), collocations (e. g. <b>eye</b> <b>dropper,</b> re...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} the force needed to extract a drop {{from a range}} of current prostaglandin monotherapy eye droppers and how this related to the comfortable and maximum pressure subjects could exert. METHODS: The comfortable and maximum pressure subjects could apply to an <b>eye</b> <b>dropper</b> constructed around a set of cantilevered pressure sensors and mounted above their eye was assessed in 102 subjects (mean 51. 2 ± 18. 7  years), repeated three times. A load cell amplifier, mounted on a stepper motor controlled linear slide, was constructed and calibrated to test the force required to extract the first three drops from 13 multidose or unidose latanoprost medication eye droppers. RESULTS: The pressure that could be exerted on a dropper comfortably (25. 9 ± 17. 7 Newtons, range 1. 2 - 87. 4) could be exceeded with effort (to 64. 8 ± 27. 1 Newtons, range 19. 9 - 157. 8; F= 19. 045, p< 0. 001), and did not differ between repeats (F= 0. 609, p= 0. 545). Comfortable and maximum pressures exerted were correlated (r= 0. 618, p< 0. 001), neither were influenced strongly by age (r= 0. 138, p= 0. 168; r=- 0. 118, p= 0237, respectively), but were lower in women than in men (F= 12. 757, p= 0. 001). The force required to expel a drop differed between dropper designs (F= 22. 528, p< 0. 001), ranging from 6. 4 Newtons to 23. 4 Newtons. The force needed to exert successive drops increased (F= 36. 373, p< 0. 001) and storing droppers in the fridge further increased the force required (F= 7. 987, p= 0. 009).
