5000|$|The order affects {{aircraft}} whose {{air conditioning}} units have a possibility of heating up what {{can be considered a}} normally empty center wing fuel tank. Some Airbus A320 and Boeing 747 aircraft are slated for [...] "early action". Regarding new aircraft designs, the Airbus A380 does not have a center wing fuel tank and is therefore exempt, and the Boeing 787 has a fuel tank safety system that already complies with the proposed rule. The FAA has stated that there have been four fuel tank explosions in the previous 16 years—two on the ground, and two in the air—and that based on this statistic and on the FAA's estimate that one such explosion would happen every 60 million hours of flight time, about 9 such explosions will probably occur in the next 50 years. The inerting systems will probably prevent 8 of those 9 probable explosions, the FAA said.Before the <b>inerting</b> <b>system</b> rule was proposed, Boeing stated that it would install its own <b>inerting</b> <b>system</b> on airliners it manufactures beginning in 2005. Airbus had argued that its planes' electrical wiring made the <b>inerting</b> <b>system</b> an unnecessary expense.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>inerting</b> <b>system</b> {{decreases}} {{the probability of}} combustion of flammable materials stored in a confined space, especially a fuel tank, by maintaining a chemically non-reactive or [...] "inert" [...] gas, such as nitrogen, in such a space.

50|$|A {{drawback}} is {{that due to}} oil's lower density, in event of underpressure in the reaction vessel, enough oil may be sucked through the sump into the <b>inert</b> gas <b>system</b> to contaminate it. Due to the same reason, the pressure within the <b>inert</b> gas <b>system</b> will always remain close to atmospheric. This is a disadvantage when attempting cannula transfers using inert gas pressure to force a liquid reagent into another using a cannula.|$|R
40|$|We {{quantify}} the destabilising {{effect of a}} first-order chemical reaction on the fingering instability of a diffusive boundary layer in a porous medium. Using scaling, we show that the dynamics of such a reactive boundary layer is fully determined by two dimensionless groups: Da/Ra$^{ 2 }$, which measures the timescale for convection compared to those for reaction and diffusion; and βC/βA, which reflects the density change induced by the product relative {{to that of the}} diffusing solute. Linear stability and numerical results for βC/βA in the range 0 – 10 and Da/Ra$^{ 2 }$ in the range 0 – 0. 01 are presented. It is shown that the chemical reaction increases the growth rate of a transverse perturbation and favours large wavenumbers compared to the <b>inert</b> <b>system.</b> Higher βC/βA and Da/Ra$^{ 2 }$ not only accelerate the onset of convection, but crucially also double the transport of the solute compared to the <b>inert</b> <b>system.</b> Application of our findings to the storage of carbon dioxide in carbonate saline aquifers reveals that chemical equilibrium curtails this increase of CO$_{ 2 }$ flux to 50 %.

40|$|Abstract. There {{are several}} oxygen {{concentration}} measurement methods applied in aircraft fuel tank <b>inerting</b> <b>systems.</b> In this work, an aircraft fuel tank <b>inerting</b> experiment <b>system</b> was built and oxygen {{concentration of the}} fuel tank ullage (fuel tank space above {{the surface of the}} fuel which is filled with fuel vapor and air) and the dissolved oxygen in the fuel was detected with the methods of light absorption and optical fluorescence. The experiment was conducted through different operating conditions and results has illustrated that the light absorption method as well as the optical fluorescence method has the same accuracy sensing calibration gases, but the suitable condition of the two methods are different. Results have shown that the method of light absorption is more suitable to test oxygen concentration of gas mixture, and the method of optical fluorescence is more suitable to detect the concentration of dissolved oxygen in liquid substance...|$|R
50|$|All test stands require safety {{provisions}} {{to protect against}} the destructive potential of an unplanned engine detonation. The {{safety provisions}} generally include building the stand some minimum distance from inhabited areas or other critical facilities, placing the stand behind a thick concrete blast wall or earthen berm, and using some form of <b>inerting</b> <b>system</b> (either gaseous nitrogen or helium) to eliminate the buildup of explosive mixtures.|$|E
50|$|After the Flight 800 crash, a 2001 {{report by}} an FAA {{committee}} stated that U.S. airlines {{would have to}} spend US$35 billion to retrofit their existing aircraft fleets with inerting systems that might prevent future such explosions. However, another FAA group developed a nitrogen enriched air (NEA) based <b>inerting</b> <b>system</b> prototype that operated on compressed air supplied by the aircraft’s propulsive engines. Also, the FAA determined that the fuel tank could be rendered inert by reducing the ullage oxygen concentration to 12% rather than previously accepted threshold of 9-10%. Boeing commenced testing a derivative system of their own, performing successful test flights in 2003 with several 747 aircraft.The new, simplified <b>inerting</b> <b>system</b> was originally suggested to the FAA through public comment. It uses a hollow fiber membrane material that separates supplied air into nitrogen-enriched air (NEA) and oxygen enriched air (OEA). This technology is extensively used for generating oxygen-enriched air for medical purposes. It uses a membrane that preferentially allows the nitrogen molecule (molecular weight 28) to pass through it and not the oxygen molecule (molecular weight 32).|$|E

50|$|The most {{important}} advantage of mercury over oil, {{is that a}} fair amount of pressure can be maintained within the <b>inert</b> gas <b>system</b> (equivalent to the height of the mercury column). Tall columns may be used to exploit this further. By increasing the pressure within the <b>inert</b> gas <b>system,</b> boiling points are increased, allowing reactions under reflux to be carried out at a higher temperature. Also, cannula transfers are accomplished more easily due to the greater gas pressure available to push a liquid reagent from a vessel, through a cannula, into another vessel.|$|R
40|$|The mixing {{term that}} appears in {{probability}} density function-based formulations of the statistical behavior of turbulent reacting flows was studied {{with the use of}} direct numerical simulations of an irreversible, second-order, isothermal chemical reaction between initially segregated reactants in decaying, homogeneous turbulence. Three-dimensional, time-dependent pseudospectral calculations with 64 -cubed Fourier modes were made as well as were Monte Carlo simulations of the joint concentration pdf equations for coalescence-dispersion (C/D) models. It was found that the development of the scalar microscales depends largely on the initial concentration distributions (both isotropic and nonisotropic distributions were used) and is relatively independent of the reaction rate constant. Joint concentration probability density functions were compared to predictions of D/D models that make use of parameters evaluated from the nonreacting or <b>inert</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
50|$|Unlike the {{inerting}} {{systems on}} military aircraft, this <b>inerting</b> <b>system</b> would run continuously to reduce fuel vapor flammability whenever the aircraft's engines are running; and its {{goal is to}} reduce oxygen content within the fuel tank to 12%, lower than normal atmospheric oxygen content of 21%, but {{higher than that of}} inerted military aircraft fuel tanks, which is a target of 9% oxygen. This is accomplished by ventilating fuel vapor laden ullage gas out of the tank and into the atmosphere.|$|E

50|$|Starting in 1950, several {{models of}} the B-47 {{included}} a fuel tank <b>inerting</b> <b>system,</b> in which dry ice was sublimed into carbon dioxide vapor while the fuel pumps operated or while the in-flight refueling system was in use.

Ten carbon dioxide tanks and heaters were involved. The system was implemented largely to reduce risks from static electricity discharges occurring during in-flight refueling.|$|E

Indeed, early versions of Kimmel's system weighed 2,000 pounds—which would have probably made an aircraft too heavy to fly with passengers on it.
