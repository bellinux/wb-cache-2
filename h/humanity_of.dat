5|$|All {{three letters}} of John were likely written {{within a few}} years of each other, and {{internal}} evidence indicates that they were written after the Gospel of John, placing them {{in the second half of}} the first century. This dating makes sense given their allusions and opposition to Gnostic and docetic teaching, which denied the full <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> Jesus, and which was gaining ascendancy at the end of the first century.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{the corpse}} of a shapeshifter is found, {{shot in the head}} with its data disc—encoded {{information}} regarding its mission—missing. When the identity connects it to one of the employees at the facility where the Fringe mainframe is housed, Broyles suspects a mole seeking to wipe out Fauxlivia's data, and orders a mainframe lockdown, while verifying the <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> key people in the FBI and Massive Dynamic. Astrid identifies several other potential candidates, including a doctor from Massive Dynamic who had already left. By the time Fringe division reaches his home, they find the man, a shapeshifter, already dead.|$|E
5|$|The year 1823 saw the {{founding}} of the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery (later the Anti-Slavery Society), and the publication of Wilberforce's 56-page Appeal to the Religion, Justice and <b>Humanity</b> <b>of</b> the Inhabitants of the British Empire in Behalf of the Negro Slaves in the West Indies. In his treatise, Wilberforce urged that total emancipation was morally and ethically required, and that slavery was a national crime that must be ended by parliamentary legislation to gradually abolish slavery. Members of Parliament did not quickly agree, and government opposition in March 1823 stymied Wilberforce's call for abolition. On 15 May 1823, Buxton moved another resolution in Parliament for gradual emancipation. Subsequent debates followed on 16 March and 11 June 1824 in which Wilberforce made his last speeches in the Commons, and which again saw the emancipationists outmanoeuvred by the government.|$|E

25|$|The Manifestations of God are {{not seen}} as incarnations of God, and are also {{not seen as}} {{ordinary}} mortals. Instead, the Bahá'í concept of the Manifestation of God emphasizes simultaneously the <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> that intermediary and the divinity {{in the way they}} show forth the will, knowledge and attributes of God; thus they have both human and divine stations.|$|E
25|$|One major {{objective}} of Barth is {{to recover the}} doctrine of the Trinity in theology from its putative loss in liberalism. His argument follows from the idea that God is the object of God's own self-knowledge, and revelation in the Bible means the self-unveiling to <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> the God who cannot be discovered by humanity simply through its own intuition.|$|E

25|$|Founded by Francis of Assisi in {{the early}} 13th century, the Franciscan Friars {{emphasized}} devotion to the Incarnation, the <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> Jesus Christ. Saint Francis developed and articulated this devotion based on his experiences of contemplative prayer in front the San Damiano Crucifix {{and the practice of}} compassion among lepers and social outcasts. Franciscan prayer includes the conscious remembering of the human life of Jesus and the practice of care for the poor and marginalized.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{appearance}} {{of an action}} film, Blade Runner operates on an unusually rich number of dramatic levels. As {{with much of the}} cyberpunk genre, it owes a large debt to film noir, containing and exploring such conventions as the femme fatale, a Chandleresque first-person narration in the Theatrical Version, the questionable moral outlook of the hero — extended here to include even the literal <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> the hero, as well as the usual dark and shadowy cinematography.|$|E

25|$|Reviewers {{have found}} that his book vividly {{demonstrated}} the full and complex <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> Africans {{as much as the}} inhumanity of slavery. The book was considered an exemplary work of English literature by a new African author. Equiano did so well in sales that he achieved independence from his benefactors. He travelled extensively throughout England, Scotland, and Ireland promoting the book. He worked to improve economic, social and educational conditions in Africa. Specifically, he became involved in working in Sierra Leone, a colony founded in 1792 for freed slaves by Britain in West Africa.|$|E
25|$|What {{women might}} have gained from {{cultivating}} devotions {{such as these}} has recently become a contentious matter. According to one school of thought, here lay an empowerment of women, both because the period’s cultural description of their bodies was preoccupied with blood and lactation and with nourishing in ways that implied a convergence between women and the salvific life-giving body of Christ (pouring out Eucharistic blood on the cross), and secondly because women were so constituted by their culture as subjected, powerless, suffering beings that they could ‘represent’ with particular force the suffering <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> Christ.|$|E
25|$|Life {{expectancy}} in Italy is 80 {{for males}} and 85 for females, placing the country 6th {{in the world for}} life expectancy. In comparison to other Western countries, Italy has a relatively low rate of adult obesity (below 10%), probably thanks to the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet. The proportion of daily smokers was 22% in 2012, down from 24.4% in 2000 but still slightly above the OECD average. Smoking in public places including bars, restaurants, night clubs and offices has been restricted to specially ventilated rooms since 2005. In 2013, UNESCO added the Mediterranean diet to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of <b>Humanity</b> <b>of</b> Italy (promoter), Morocco, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus and Croatia.|$|E

25|$|The {{opinions}} that pit races {{against one another}} are likely to reflect Tolkien’s critique on war rather than a racist perspective. In The Two Towers, the character Samwise sees a fallen foe and considers {{for a moment the}} <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> this fallen Southron who, just moments before, is shown to be a man of color. Director Peter Jackson considers Sam this scene in the director’s commentary of the scene and argues that Tolkien isn’t projecting any negative sentiments towards the individual soldier because of his race, but the evil that’s driving them from their authority, These sentiments, Jackson argues, were derived from Tolkien’s experience in the Great War and found their way into his writings to show the evils of war itself, not of other races.|$|E
25|$|Barks's stories (whether humorous adventures or {{domestic}} comedies) often exhibited a wry, dark irony born of hard experience. The ten-pagers showcased Donald as everyman, struggling against the cruel bumps and bruises {{of everyday life}} with the nephews often acting as a Greek chorus commenting on the unfolding disasters Donald wrought upon himself. Yet while seemingly defeatist in tone, the <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> the characters shines through in their persistence despite the obstacles. These stories found popularity not only among young children but adults as well. Despite the fact that Barks had done little traveling his adventure stories often had the duck clan globe-trotting to the most remote or spectacular of places. This allowed Barks to indulge his penchant for elaborate backgrounds that hinted at his thwarted ambitions of doing realistic stories in the vein of Hal Foster's Prince Valiant.|$|E
25|$|Each of {{the four}} {{official}} class governments (Sophomore and Junior Steering Committees and the Freshman and Senior Senates) makes significant annual donations to various philanthropic causes throughout the community, state, country, and world. Every year since 2001, the Senior Senate has fully funded {{the construction of a}} house in conjunction with Habitat for <b>Humanity</b> <b>of</b> Lake County, Illinois, a non-profit organization that fights homelessness and substandard housing. A recent goal of the campaign was 10 houses in 10 years, and the class of 2010 fulfilled that goal. New Trier is the only school so far to build 10 houses with Habitat. Many fundraisers contribute to this and various other causes {{over the course of the}} academic year. The New Trier Tsunami Relief Committee donated more than $18,000 to relief organizations to save people who were affected by the tsunami, and also helped victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004.|$|E
