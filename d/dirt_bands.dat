50|$|When {{the tension}} in the ice {{increases}} as the slope increases, the glacier is unable to deform and crevasses appear. These are notably transversal and, when there is intense crevasse activity on the steepest terrain, blocks of seracs appear as the glacier breaks up. Crevasses are of variable depth, depending on their position, and may be as deep as fifty metres. Seracs always form in the same places, namely the steepest sections over which the glacier flows. As crevasses open and seracs tumble downstream, the supply of ice is renewed by the constant flow from upstream. Broad banding patterns, visible {{on the surface of the}} Mer de Glace, are known as ogives, or Forbes bands, and result from differences in summer and winter collapse rates of the serac fields. It was on 24 July 1842 that Scottish physicist James David Forbes observed the pattern of light and dark <b>dirt</b> <b>bands</b> on the Mer de Glace from the nearby Charmoz and began to consider whether glaciers flowed in a similar fashion to a sluggish river and with a viscous or plastic manner.|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to developing {{various types of}} coal-interface detection system, the US Bureau of Miner is actively in involved in developing a coal rib-thickness monitoring system for highwall mining applications. One particular system that shows promise in a ground-pentetrating radar system to detect the coal-air boundaries of coal rifts. Based on preliminary laboratory and field tests results indicate that this method can be applied successfully in highwall mines to maintain constant rib thickness. The coal seam should be relatively clean {{in the vicinity of}} the antenna (e. g., have minimal partings or <b>dirt</b> <b>bands)</b> for best results...|$|E
40|$|The {{project was}} {{conducted}} on four coals seams, the Shallow and Yard (Lower Coal Measures) from Lea Hall Colliery at Rugeley, and the Park and-Eight Feet seams from Littleton Colliery, near Cannock. Ultimate, proximate analyses and moisture contents showed them to be of high volatile bituminous 'B' coal-rank, and typical of high Cl coals. The Cl investigation showed a relationship with organic matter where ash is a dilutant, reaching c. 1 % (by weight) in the coals, almost an order {{higher than in the}} associated mudrocks. It is related to the internal surface area and is thus highest in the vitrinite dominated 'bright rocks' and lowest in the 'dull coals'. Two types of Cl were identified, originating from saline ground waters, the former representing present ground water solutions trapped in the larger pores and readily water-soluble, and the latter held in organic combination within smaller or closed pores produced by Hercynian rank imposition. Varying levels of this Cl can be released by ion exchange with carbonates in leaching experiments. The mudrock and coal ash mineralogy {{was conducted on}} low temperature ashed material which suffered the side-effect of gypsum formation during oxidation. The mudrock mineralogy is dominated by detrital minerals, quartz and clays predominating. Diagenetic minerals rarely account for 7 % of the normative minerals except in localised pyrite and siderite nodules., Climate {{played an important role in}} the detrital mineralogy, the lower seam floor measures being dominated by a tropically leached suite of kaolinite and quartz. Continental movement led to increased aridity characterised by illite and chlorite which dominate the higher seams. The intraseam <b>dirt</b> <b>bands</b> are composed of very fine clays, rapidly deposited over wide areas by minor base-level changes or river (ii) bank bursts. The roof measures show least evidence of leaching and are often highest in diagenetic siderite. Ba, Sr, Rb (illite) and Zr (zircon) are predominantly detrital trace elements whilst oxyhydroxide material was-the transporting media. for the diagenetically located elements, Ni, Pb (pyrite), Co and Mn (siderite). Cu is primarily associated with organic matter. The detrital coal mineralogy reflects the fine mudrock material and is usually highest associated with the <b>dirt</b> <b>bands.</b> Diagenetic minerals dominate the ash, reaching 95 % (by weight), the major component being late diagenetic cleat. A paragenetic sequence of mineralisation follows a widespread trend from sulphides, silicates to carbonates reflecting changing ground water composition. The cleat fractures represent microjointing produced with stress release during uplift. Its frequence decreases with bed thickness, and the brittle nature of vitrinite causes it to have the earliest formed and most abundant cleat. The strength of multimaceral lithotypes such as durain is much greater and therefore fracture least, later änd with a greater dilation...|$|E

40|$|We {{measured}} TL {{properties of}} ninety Asuka (A) ordinary chondrites (LL: 16, L: 27, H: 47) from Japanese Antarctic meteorite collection. Most of the chondrites had TL sensitivities over 0. 1, corresponding to petrologic subtype 3. 5 - 3. 9. Eight chondrites, A- 881244 (L 3), A- 881607 (LL 3), A- 881328 (LL 3), A- 881408 (LL 3), A- 881397 (LL 3), A- 881522 (L 3), A- 881357 (LL 3 or L 3), and A- 881199 (LL 3) were {{revealed to be}} primitive ordinary chondrites under petrologic subtype 3. 4, and therefore they are particularly significant in understanding the nature of primitive material in the solar system. Twenty-one chondrites with low TL sensitivities below 0. 1 (Dhajala= 1) had suffered remarkable shock and/or terrestrial weathering. Samples were mainly from three different <b>dirt</b> <b>bands</b> south of the Sr Rondane Mountains at D 1, D 2, and D 3 sites. LT/HT distribution at D 1 site suggested that chondrites at D 1 site had shorter terrestrial ages than those at D 2 and D 3. A- 880709, A- 88710, A- 88774, A- 881324 which had extremely low LT/HT ratio under 0. 1, and A- 881484 and A- 881546 which might be heated over 400 °C were presumed to have small perihelia. We found 26 TL potential paired fragments, and 9 groups. A group of H 3 at D 1 site comprises a chain of paired fragments. A H 3 chondrite might shower near the Asuka...|$|E
