40|$|Regardless {{of signing}} and signalization, {{at-grade}} intersections {{have the potential}} for vehicle-vehicle collisions as a result of vehicular conflicts. Intersection conflict points represent the locations where vehicle paths meet as they move from one <b>intersection</b> <b>leg</b> to another. Intersection conflict point analysis is a well understood means of comparing the relative safety of alternative intersection designs (1). The basic premise suggests that the intersection safety performance will decline when the design results in more conflict points. This approach is useful, but is ultimately limited because it assumes that the crash risk is equal at each conflict point, when in fact, the crash risk associated with each conflict point varies depending on the complexity and volumes of the movements involved. The greatest crash risk movements (i. e., those accounting for the largest proportion of crashes) at a typical four-legged, two-way stop controlled (TWSC) rural expressway intersection are usually the minor road left-turn and crossing maneuvers (2). Therefore, elimination or minimization of these left-turning and crossing conflicts could be an effective means of improving safety at rural expressway intersections. It has long been acknowledged that three-legged intersections operate more safely tha...|$|E

30|$|The {{developed}} models enabled both {{identification of}} {{hazardous road locations}} (network safety ranking) and evaluation of safety of planned infrastructure (road safety impact assessment). The models also provided interpretation of influence of statistically significant risk factors. Effects of typical variables (AADT, length, number of <b>intersection</b> <b>legs,</b> etc.) were consistent with literature [68]. On the other hand, several variables did not have sufficiently significant effect (for example channelization, parking space along motorway or intersection bypass lanes). However, {{it is important to}} note, that the reported effects are only associations; in order to capture causal effects, one would need to conduct before-after studies. Another caveat is that although original dataset was relatively large, there is always a risk of omitted variable bias [54]. Examples of variables, which were not taken into account, may include for example speed behaviour. Another issue was use of proportions of observed accident severities in obtaining accident severity frequencies, caused by sample size limitations. While this has been used by some authors [58], it was noted as potentially biased, due to ignoring correlations between severities and traffic volumes [75].|$|R

40|$|Since 2006, INDOT {{has been}} {{preparing}} an annual five-percent report that identifies intersections and segments on Indiana state roads that require attention due to the excessive number and severity of crashes. Many of the identified intersections are two-way, stop-controlled intersections located on high-speed, multi-lane, rural roads. Some contributing design and human factors have been identified while other factors still await investigation. Multivariate ordered probit models {{have been developed to}} help identify additional factors of the frequency and severity of crashes. These models can estimate how much different factors increase the frequency of crashes at several levels of injury severity (fatal/incapacitating, non-incapacitating/ possible, property-damage-only). They have a unique ability to account for unobserved but common conditions that affect all of the crash severity levels. Recommendations for safety countermeasures are made based on both of these research results and our study of published reports of other authors. The statistical analysis was performed on 553 existing intersections in Indiana and 72 existing intersections in Michigan using crash data reported during a four-year period. The identified safety factors include: presence of horizontal curves within the intersection vicinity, traffic volume on the major road, land use, population of the area surrounding the intersection, and the minor road functional class (traffic volume on minor road unknown), nearby at-grade railroad crossings, intersection conspicuity to drivers on the major road, acceleration lanes for both left and right turns, median width, intersection angle, and number of <b>intersection</b> <b>legs.</b> These results are in line with other research results as documented in the literature review. Based on the results of this and other studies, recommendations are made to improve safety at new intersections as well as at existing intersections. For new intersections, construction of medians wider than 80 feet is suggested. Where this is not possible and a narrower median needs to be constructed, adding a parallel acceleration lane for vehicles turning left from the minor road is suggested. Intersections should be placed at a sufficient distance from horizontal curves and from at-grade railroad crossings. Solutions with indirect left-turn lanes (Michigan U-turns, J-turns) are recommended. At existing intersections experiencing excessive numbers of crashes involving vehicles from the minor road, median closure should be considered or a median opening should be restricted to certain maneuvers. Median acceleration lanes can be added in order to allow a two-stage maneuver for left turns from the minor road. Enhanced guide and warning signage can be used to improve intersection conspicuity; adding road illumination can especially help at night. The practice of adding left- and right-turn bays should be continued as this is a proven intersection safety improvement practice. Applying these countermeasures may help improve safety and avoid the construction of expensive grade separations. Finally, advanced intersection collision avoidance systems, such as road-side dynamic signs warning drivers on the minor road about a short gap on the major road, should be the subject of pilot studies in Indiana. Experiments in other states have indicated that these systems help drivers choose safe gaps...|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{is increasingly}} becoming a severe problem in many large {{cities around the}} world. The problem is more complex in developing countries where cities are growing at a much faster rate {{than those in the}} developed world. Advanced Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) are one of the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) technologies that have been recommended and used as a tool to ease congestion problems in many large cities in the developing world. However, it is unknown how specific local conditions commonly observed in these cities, such as poor lane discipline and complex road user interactions, affect the performance of these systems. GETRAM (Generic Environment for Traffic Analysis and Modeling) was used in this research as a tool to develop microscopic traffic simulation models for the city of Bandung in Indonesia. The field data in this research, comprising throughputs, queue lengths and travel times, were collected during peak and off peak periods from all 90 signalised intersections connected to SCATS (Sydney Co-ordinated Adaptive Traffic System). This field data is believed to comprise one of the largest sets of real world data available for the development and validation of microscopic traffic simulation models. Two data sets were collected for this research: the first was used to develop and calibrate the simulation model and the second was used for validation. A number of statistical tests were used to determine the adequacy of the model in replicating traffic conditions. The results of statistical tests clearly showed that all of the calibrated and validated models reproduced field conditions with an acceptable degree of confidence. Therefore, the models were accepted as accurate and valid replications of the real world. The validated models were then used to evaluate the performance of SCATS which was implemented in Bandung in June 1997 as a pilot project. The results of comparative evaluation of the models under SCATS and under the Fixed Time control (without SCATS) demonstrated that SCATS did not necessarily always produce better results than the Fixed Time control. Furthermore, the performance of SCATS was strongly influenced by specific local conditions in the city. The multiple regression method was used to investigate the relationship between the traffic performance measures and significant basic variables. Based on this analysis, the main findings were: first, throughput was found to increase at intersections with higher v/c (volume to capacity) ratios. Second, throughput was found to decrease at intersections with higher numbers of phases and movements, longer widths of <b>leg</b> <b>intersections,</b> and farther distances to adjacent intersections. Third, queue length was found to increase at intersections with higher numbers of phases and movements. Based on the above findings, a number of improvements were recommended to enhance the performance of SCATS. This research also used traffic simulation to evaluate the impacts of these recommended improvements in increasing the performance of SCATS. The main findings from this evaluation were: first, restricted number of phases and movements at selected intersections substantially increased the traffic flow (78 %) and decreased the queue length (by 55 to 67 %) at the <b>intersection.</b> Second, making <b>leg</b> <b>intersections</b> widerwithout physically building additional road capacity but by changing the stream with higher road hierarchy and higher v/c ratio from a two-way road into a one-way roadhas a great impact on enhancing the performance of SCATS. Traffic flows were found to increase between 7 and 106 %, and queue lengths were found to markedly decrease between 77 and 100 % at all the suggested intersections. Third, the application of SCATS at intersections which are not closely spaced was not effective. Therefore, it is recommended that intersections which are not closely spaced remain under the Fixed Time control. The results and findings from this study provide road authorities in developing countries with an appreciation and enhanced understanding of the factors that influence the performance of traffic management systems in cities with similar characteristics to those in Bandung. These findings will also assist traffic engineers determine the best practices for the implementation of advanced traffic control systems in their cities...|$|R

The procedure evaluates a safety index (SI) {{that can be used to}} rank intersections for further investigations. SI can be assessed whether crash data are available or not. If crash data are available and their quality is good, SI can be effectively used in conjunction with the EB estimate of frequency as ranking criteria.

Validation of the safety index procedure was carried out by comparing the results with the EB safety estimates. The SI was assessed in twenty-two three <b>leg</b> <b>intersections</b> in Italy. In the same intersections, a safety performance function was calibrated and the EB refinement technique was used to obtain a better estimate of the existing safety performance.

Unsignalized intersection plays an important role in determining the capacity of road network especially in urban and suburban areas. A poorly operating unsignalized intersection may affect a signalized network or operation of an Intelligent Transport System. The T-junction for this study was controls by stop rule or in other names is two-way stop controlled intersection (TWSC). For a TWSC intersection, the stop controlled approaches are referred to as the minor road approaches. The most important parameters affecting the capacity and performance of unsignalized intersection are the critical gap. Basically, critical gap are establish by Highway Capacity Manual. Therefore, the critical gap is difference between each intersection based on the geometry of the road, numbers of lane, and surrounding area located near the intersection. Critical gap can not be determined directly from field but data of accepted and rejected gaps can be collected and analysed. Data of gaps were collected using video camera and several equipments. Raff s method was used in determination of critical gap. In this study, critical gap was divided into three sections which is RT from major road, RT and LT from minor road. The values of critical gap vary from 2 seconds to 7 seconds. Critical gap value that was established by HCM and from field observation was input in Sidra software to analyze the performance of the intersection. Based on analysis of output produced from Sidra software, there is found output were obtained from field observation is more closed with the actual field condition. Therefore, the performance at a TWSC intersection can be determined from this analysis in terms of queue and level of services.

The traffic micro simulation software of VISSIM was used to simulate the existing delay and to design traffic signal coordination. To obtain existing traffic volume during peak hour and off peak hour period, and to design a new cycle time for signal coordination, primary data were compiled according to direct observation. Result showed that the existing traffic route generates travel time of 57. 24 seconds and average traveling speed of 27. 42 kilometer/hour with the service level of “E” in peak hour period. The best alternative of cycle time for peak hours was 117 seconds, with average delay of 17. 65 seconds, travel time between intersection was 50. 99 seconds, average travel speed of 30. 78 kilometer/hour and the service level of “E”.
