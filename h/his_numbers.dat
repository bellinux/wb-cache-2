However, <b>his</b> <b>numbers</b> in early March 2012 showed he led Warren by 8 {{points in the}} polls. In March 2012, Brown's lead had narrowed to 2.3%, within the margin of error. As of September 2012, several polls showed Warren with a lead over Brown (with one still giving Brown an edge).|$|E
5|$|By 4:00 AM on October 16, Reshef's brigade, {{which had}} begun the {{operation}} with 97 tanks, had lost 56 in just twelve hours of fighting, leaving only 41 remaining. Although seizing the crossing site had been accomplished easily, stiff resistance had prevented Reshef from achieving his remaining objectives, namely opening the routes to the canal and securing a corridor. Reshef's force would further drop to just 27 tanks by noon. As a whole, Sharon's division suffered some 300 killed and 1,000 wounded that night. To help Reshef secure the corridor, Sharon supplied him with two tank battalions by 6:00 PM, propping <b>his</b> <b>numbers</b> up to 81 tanks.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>his</b> <b>numbers,</b> rumors were {{swirling}} {{about his}} weight {{and its effect}} on his knees and his request for a trade out of Chicago. On December 8, Smith, the team's career leader in saves, was traded to the Boston Red Sox for pitchers Al Nipper and Calvin Schiraldi. Nipper pitched only 104 more innings in the majors, and Schiraldi was out of baseball before age 30. Smith, meanwhile, registered nearly 300 saves after the trade. The trade started Smith on a journey involving seven teams in eight seasons, which may have hurt his chances in the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|Due to pancreatitis, Crozier {{played only}} 58 out of 70 {{games for the}} Red Wings in 1966–67. <b>His</b> <b>numbers</b> were down as he won only 22 games and {{recorded}} a 3.35 GAA. The Red Wings missed the playoffs. After another bout of pancreatitis {{at the beginning of}} the 1967–68 season, Crozier announced his retirement due to stress and depression. His announcement was short-lived as after six weeks, he returned to hockey. Before re-joining the Red Wings, Crozier played five games with the Fort Worth Wings of the Central Professional Hockey League (CPHL) as conditioning. Crozier spent two more seasons on a mediocre Red Wings team before being traded to the newly formed Buffalo Sabres in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Greatest five-by-fives (most of each stat): Hakeem Olajuwon, on March 10, 1987, {{became the}} first in NBA history to record a five-by-six (at least 6 each of all five statistics: points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals). It took nearly twenty years for the second {{official}} occurrence in NBA history. Andrei Kirilenko, on January 3, 2006, recorded a five-by-six against the Lakers.

On October 8, 2014, he announced that he would be exercising his player option for 2015. However, the Dodgers designated him for assignment on December 16, 2014. He was released by the Dodgers on December 19 and became a free agent.|$|E

5|$|Parker {{played a}} variety of roles in the {{following}} season. First, Kapono was temporarily moved to the starting shooting guard spot after the Raptors fired head coach Sam Mitchell. When Calderón was injured, Parker had to fill in {{as the starting point}} guard. After struggling in December, he hit good form in January and helped the Raptors inch towards a better record after the team went 16–28. Although Parker eventually regained his starting spot, Toronto fell further behind the playoff race as a result of changing rosters and inconsistent performances, dropping to 21–34 just before the All-Star break. The shooting guard's offensive output was also erratic throughout the season, and the Raptors all but fell out of the playoffs picture by March. The Raptors eventually concluded the regular season with only 33 wins, with Parker suffering a significant drop in <b>his</b> <b>numbers</b> (shooting percentage and points per game). His future remained uncertain as he was due to become a free agent, but he expressed a desire to return to Toronto for the next season. With Toronto selecting shooting guard DeMar DeRozan in the 2009 NBA draft, that uncertainy was compounded.|$|E
5|$|Rivera began 2006 with a 3.72ERA and two {{losses in}} April, but <b>his</b> <b>numbers</b> {{improved}} in subsequent months. On June6, he saved his 391st career game, passing Dennis Eckersley for the fourth-most saves {{in major league}} history. Rivera was selected to his third consecutive All-Star team with a 1.76ERA and 19saves entering the midseason break. He saved the AL's comeback victory in the 2006 All-Star Game for his third career All-Star save, tying him with Eckersley for the most ever. On July16, Rivera achieved another milestone by becoming the fourth MLB pitcher to reach 400saves. Although a throwing elbow strain sidelined Rivera for most of September, he finished the 2006 season with 34saves in 37opportunities and an ERA of 1.80—his fourth consecutive season with a sub-2.00ERA. For a second consecutive year, fans voted him the Delivery Man of the Year.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{forces are}} {{generally}} described as in Morrissey. <b>His</b> <b>numbers</b> are generally {{consistent with other}} sources on the British units, although there is disagreement across {{a wide array of}} sources on the number of troops under Breymann, which are generally listed at either approximately 550 or 650. Morrissey is also incorrect in identifying some of the American units. He identifies William Gregg as having a separate command; Gregg apparently led several companies in Nichols' regiment. Morrissey also failed to include the Massachusetts militia, and misidentified Langdon's company, erroneously believing they may have been from Worcester, Massachusetts. (Militia companies from the Worcester area marched on Bennington, with some companies arriving the day after the battle.) Langdon originally raised his company in 1776, but it did not become a cavalry unit until 1778.|$|E

5|$|Having had two frigates {{confirm that}} the French fleet was still at Brest, and {{realising}} that it would leave to protect the imminent convoy, Howe attempted an interception in advance by placing his ships where he thought an encounter likely. After thirteen days of searching, the British fleet returned on 19May, to find the fleet in Brest gone. On the same day, Howe's fleet fell in with the fifth-rate , which had been attached to Rear-Admiral Sir George Montagu's squadron. Also searching for the convoy, Montagu had been cruising between Cape Ortugal and Belle-Isle, but knowing he would be hopelessly outnumbered, he had sent Venus to locate Howe and ask for reinforcements. At 04:00 the next morning, Howe ordered all sail {{in an attempt to}} reach Montagu before the French. A Dutch convoy, bound for Lisbon, had been captured by the French on 19 May and some of these ships were intercepted by the British on 21 May. The crews were able to provide information regarding the whereabouts of the French fleet and Howe set off in pursuit, realising that Montagu was no longer in danger. Not wishing to reduce <b>his</b> <b>numbers</b> by allocating prize crews, Howe ordered the convoy destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} 12appearances of 2009, Rivera {{surrendered}} four {{home runs and}} had a 3.97ERA, leading to speculation about his cutter's effectiveness and his shoulder's health at age 39. As the season progressed, <b>his</b> <b>numbers</b> improved, and he reached a milestone on June28 by becoming the second pitcher with 500regular season saves. In the same game, while batting against fellow closer Francisco Rodríguez, he collected his first career run batted in by walking with the bases loaded. With 23saves in 24opportunities and a 2.43ERA in the season's first half, Rivera was named an All-Star for the tenth time. At the 2009 MLB All-Star Game, he set a record by saving his fourth career All-Star Game. In the season's second half, Rivera allowed earned runs in only two of his final 40appearances, while he set a new personal best for consecutive save opportunities converted with 36. He finished the regular season with a 1.76ERA, 44saves in 46opportunities, and a 0.90WHIP. In the postseason, he pitched 16innings, allowing one earned run and saving five games, and he clinched the Yankees' victory in the 2009 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies—his fifth championship. He was the only closer who did not record a loss or blown save that postseason. Rivera collected several awards at season's end, including his third Delivery Man Award, his fifth AL Rolaids Relief Man Award, and the 2009 Sporting News Pro Athlete of the Year Award. Reflecting on the decade's end, ESPN.com's Jerry Crasnick called Rivera the most valuable major league pitcher of the previous 10 years.|$|E
5|$|Nathan {{was traded}} to the Minnesota Twins on November 16, 2003. The Giants sent Nathan to the Twins along with {{pitchers}} Boof Bonser and Francisco Liriano for catcher A. J. Pierzynski and cash. The Twins decided to make Nathan their closer starting in 2004, risky move considering that Nathan had notched only one save in six opportunities as a Giant, but he won the job over J. C. Romero and Jesse Crain in spring training. He was signed to a three-year deal on March 4, 2004 and agreed to an incentive-laden contract with a base salary of $440,000. He started off the season strong, allowing no runs in 20 appearances and earning 14 saves from April 15 to June 4. He was named AL Co-Player of the Week starting on May 10 with four saves in four innings and four appearances, facing the minimum number of batters each time. His credentials {{for the first half of}} the season, 23 saves in 24 opportunities with a 1.19 ERA in 26 appearances, earned him his first All-Star appearance in the 2004 MLB All-Star Game. He was the only Twin on the squad and pitched a perfect seventh inning, getting Bobby Abreu to strike out, Mike Lowell to fly out and Miguel Cabrera to strike out. <b>His</b> <b>numbers</b> were impressive through the rest of the season, allowing no runs between June 9 and August 18, and between August 25 and September 16. and finishing 2004 with 44 saves in 47 opportunities and an ERA of 1.62. The Twins won the AL Central division and faced the New York Yankees in the ALDS. Nathan picked up his first postseason save in Game 1, but blew his second opportunity in Game 2 as the Twins went on to lose the ensuing three games. His outstanding season earned him MVP and Cy Young votes, finishing fourth for Cy Young and 12th for MVP. His first child, a son named Cole, was born on November 9, 2004.|$|E
