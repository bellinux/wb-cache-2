5|$|In Nuevo León, about 6,000residents {{who lived}} near the Conchos, Guayalejo, and Grande Rivers were {{evacuated}} from their residences across the state. Also, the precipitation from Gert caused about 100collective <b>farms</b> <b>to</b> become {{isolated from the}} rest of the state in the municipality of Montemorelos. In the city, one building was evacuated, as a 100ft (30m) fissure appeared on the ground near the structure.|$|E

For a few particular scenes, where Saran teaches Nagarjuna some farm chores, the team made a few takes, as Nagajuna, being a quick learner, completed the tasks better than Saran.|$|E
5|$|The final {{decades of}} this era saw a {{worsening}} economic situation for many Plebeians. The long military campaigns had forced citizens {{to leave their}} farms, which often caused those <b>farms</b> <b>to</b> fall {{into a state of}} disrepair. This situation was made worse during the Second Punic War, when Hannibal fought the Romans throughout Italy, and the Romans adopted a strategy of attrition and guerrilla warfare in response. When the soldiers returned from the battlefield, they often had to sell their <b>farms</b> <b>to</b> pay their debts, and the landed aristocracy quickly bought these farms at discounted prices. The wars had also brought to Rome a great surplus of inexpensive slave labor, which the landed aristocrats used to staff their new farms. Soon the masses of unemployed Plebeians began to flood into Rome, and into the ranks of the legislative assemblies.|$|E
5|$|The {{progressive}} {{movement in}} the United States was at its height during the early 20th century. With the migration of families from <b>farms</b> <b>to</b> cities, there were concerns among some people that young men were no longer learning patriotism and individualism.

5|$|Two {{months later}} Governor John Hunter {{appointed}} him superintendent of convicts for the Hawkesbury region, a newly established area of <b>farms</b> <b>to</b> the northwest of Baker's own lands. His reputation was somewhat marred by a 1797 conviction for stealing a boat worth ₤16 from a neighbour, Thomas Raby. Baker admitted {{possession of the}} vessel but denied it was Raby's. He {{was found guilty of}} theft and fined a proportion of the vessel's value.|$|E
5|$|According to the National Trust, {{the grass}} is trimmed {{regularly}} and the giant is fully re-chalked every 25 years. Traditionally, the National Trust has relied on sheep from surrounding <b>farms</b> <b>to</b> graze the site. However, in 2008 a lack of sheep, coupled with a wet spring causing extra plant growth, forced a re-chalking of the giant, with 17 tonnes of new chalk being poured in and tamped down by hand. In 2006, the National Trust carried out the first wildlife survey of the Cerne Abbas Giant, identifying wild flowers including the green-winged orchid, clustered bellflower and autumn gentian, which are uncommon in England.|$|E

5|$|Dan Albone {{constructed}} the first commercially successful gasoline-powered {{general purpose tractor}} in 1901, and the 1923 International Harvester Farmall tractor marked a major point in the replacement of draft animals (particularly horses) with machines. Since that time, self-propelled mechanical harvesters (combines), planters, transplanters and other equipment have been developed, further revolutionizing agriculture. These inventions allowed farming tasks {{to be done with}} a speed and on a scale previously impossible, leading modern <b>farms</b> <b>to</b> output much greater volumes of high-quality produce per land unit.|$|E
5|$|European horse breeders also {{obtained}} Arabian stock {{directly from}} the desert or via trade with the Ottomans. In Russia, Count Alexey Orlov obtained many Arabians, including Smetanka, an Arabian stallion who became a foundation sire of the Orlov trotter. Orlov then provided Arabian horses to Catherine the Great, who in 1772 owned 12 pure Arabian stallions and 10 mares. By 1889 {{two members of the}} Russian nobility, Count Stroganov and Prince Nikolai Borisovich Shcherbatov, established Arabian stud <b>farms</b> <b>to</b> meet the continued need to breed Arabians as a source of pure bloodstock.|$|E
5|$|First {{settled by}} Europeans in the 1790s, Scarborough {{has grown from}} a {{collection}} of small rural villages and <b>farms</b> <b>to</b> become fully urbanised with a diverse cultural community. Incorporated in 1850 as a township, Scarborough became part of Metropolitan Toronto in 1953 and was reconstituted as a borough in 1967. Scarborough rapidly developed as a suburb of Old Toronto over the next decade and became a city in 1983. In 1998, Scarborough and the rest of Metropolitan Toronto were amalgamated into the present city of Toronto. Scarborough is an administrative district in Toronto and has its own community council. The Scarborough Civic Centre, the former city hall, is still used by the municipal government of Toronto.|$|E

5|$|Fish {{hatcheries}} provide larval {{and juvenile}} fish, crustaceans and shellfish, {{for use in}} aquaculture systems. When large enough these are transferred to growing-on tanks and sold to fish <b>farms</b> <b>to</b> reach harvest size. Some species that are commonly raised in hatcheries include shrimps, prawns, salmon, tilapia, oysters and scallops. Similar facilities {{can be used to}} raise species with conservation needs to be released into the wild, or game fish for restocking waterways. Important aspects of husbandry at these early stages include selection of breeding stock, control of water quality and nutrition. In the wild, there is a massive amount of mortality at the nursery stage; farmers seek to minimise this {{while at the same time}} maximising growth rates.|$|E
5|$|For years, Rosecroft Raceway held {{an annual}} sale of {{yearling}} Standardbred horses. It hosted the annual Maryland Sire Stake Races {{to promote the}} best of Maryland-bred horses. When Rosecroft opened, it became {{the political and social}} center for Prince George's County, Maryland. Each year during the Miller era, several thousand people traveled from across the country to wager on and watch the horses. In 1953, Rosecroft's attendance of 192,585 was the highest among all harness tracks in Maryland. Owners, trainers, and drivers from across the United States moved their <b>farms</b> <b>to</b> Maryland in the 1950s following the opening of Rosecroft, hoping to compete with the best horses.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} decades of this era many plebeians grew poorer. The long {{military}} campaigns had forced citizens {{to leave their}} <b>farms</b> <b>to</b> fight, while their farms fell into disrepair. The landed aristocracy began buying bankrupted farms at discounted prices. As commodity prices fell, many farmers could no longer operate their farms at a profit. The result was the ultimate bankruptcy of countless farmers. Masses of unemployed plebeians soon began to flood into Rome, and thus {{into the ranks of}} the legislative assemblies. Their poverty usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered them the most. A new culture of dependency was emerging, in which citizens would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E

5|$|M-142 begins just a {{few miles}} south of Bay Port at an {{intersection}} with M-25 near the Bay Port Cemetery, about two-thirds of a mile (1.1km) inland from Saginaw Bay. From there, the road travels eastward through farm country on Pigeon Road. The highway follows a direct course over the Pigeon River to the village of Pigeon, when M-142 turns south on Main Street to exit town. South of town, the Pigeon Road name resumes, and after about , M-142 turns back eastward near the Grand Lawn Cemetery. The road then continues eastward through more <b>farms</b> <b>to</b> Elkton, diverting off a direct course to cross a line of the Huron and Eastern Railway {{on the east side of}} town.|$|E
5|$|North of Wemple, the {{sporadic}} residences {{along the}} highway are replaced by a string of tank farms serving barges on the Hudson River. The industrial surroundings follow NY144 into the hamlet of Glenmont, centered on the route's junction with Glenmont Road. Here, NY144 crosses over another set of railroad tracks before heading northeastward from the community toward Normans Kill. The route runs alongside the Hudson River tributary and another set of tank <b>farms</b> <b>to</b> an intersection with NY32 (Corning Hill Road) near the Port of Albany–Rensselaer, where the NY144 designation terminates. NY32 continues northward {{from this point on}} NY144's right-of-way, becoming South Pearl Street and immediately crossing Normans Kill to enter the city of Albany.|$|E
5|$|The 1834 revolt and the {{immediate}} aftermath reduced the male population of Palestine by about one-fifth. This decrease is attributed to {{the large numbers of}} peasants who were either deported to Egypt to work in manufacturing, drafted into Egypt's military, or abandoned their villages and <b>farms</b> <b>to</b> join the Bedouin nomadic populations. Around 10,000 peasants were deported to Egypt and the general population was disarmed. The conscription orders were extended beyond the Muslim population to the local Christians. Taxes were also extended from landed property to include livestock as well. As Ibrahim consolidated his hold over Palestine and disarmed the population, banditry by local tribesmen and civil strife was largely eliminated.|$|E
