5|$|While the Enterprise is {{en route}} to Pacifica on a {{scientific}} mission, Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) receives a highly confidential message from an old friend, Captain Walker Keel (Jonathan Farwell) of the USS Horatio. Keel refuses to discuss his concerns, even though the frequency he is using <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> secure channel, and insists on a face-to-face meeting. Once they arrive at Dytallix B for this secret meeting, the crew discover the Horatio and two other Federation ships already present. Picard beams alone {{to the surface and}} is met by Captain Keel and the other captains. Keel reports strange orders from Starfleet headquarters and what he implies are suspicious deaths of Starfleet officers, and expresses concern of a conspiracy. Picard refuses to accept this without proof, but Keel warns him to remain wary. When the captain returns to the Enterprise, he is challenged by Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) about keeping his contact with Keel secret. Picard is skeptical about the conspiracy, but says that he trusts his old friend completely. The Enterprise resumes its previous journey. Picard has Commander Data (Brent Spiner) review all orders issued by Starfleet Command in the past six months. While the ship is still on its way to Pacifica, a disturbance is detected in nearby space. Upon investigating this, the Enterprise discovers a mass of debris that surely must be the shattered remains of the Horatio. Data completes his study and finds several strange orders from the senior levels of Starfleet. Picard informs his senior staff of the conspiracy theory, and orders the Enterprise to Earth.|$|E
25|$|Empirical {{concepts}} are ultimately based on empirical perceptions. Kant, however, tried to claim that, analogously, pure concepts (Categories) {{also have a}} basis. This pure basis <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> kind of pure perception, which he called a schema. But such an empiricist analogy contradicts his previous rationalist assertion that pure concepts (Categories) simply exist in the human mind without having been derived from perceptions. Therefore, they are not based on pure, schematic perceptions.|$|E

When she is finally captured, Bond makes a deal, off the record, to go to Guangzhou and retrieve the long-forgotten document from General Wong that will give Li Xu Nan ownership of EurAsia Enterprises upon the exchange at midnight on July 1, 1997. Through Li's contacts, Bond successfully travels and meets General Wong in Guangzhou under the guise of a solicitor from England. Bond's cover is later blown and T.Y. Woo who followed Bond is executed. Bond avenges his friend's death by killing General Wong and stealing the document, which he hand delivers to Li Xu Nan and retrieves Sunni Pei.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{concern with}} the nature of free will and {{determinism}} grew out of Morgan's difficulties with plotting and constructing plot-twists; he explained that Bruckman and the killer interact in ways [...] "that were really easy to plot, but which makes the story seem complicated." [...] While writing the character's lines, Morgan realized that Mulder, were he to interact with a [...] "normal person", would come off as sounding insane when in fact he <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> smart person. As such, Morgan decided to [...] "shake up Mulder's image" [...] to make him look slightly ridiculous; in the episode, Mulder views Bruckman [...] "only as a phenomenon" [...] and not as a person. To counter this, Morgan wrote Scully to see Bruckman, not as a psychic, but as a human.|$|E
500|$|Bart's rebellious nature, which {{frequently}} {{resulted in}} no punishment for his misbehavior, led some parents and conservatives to characterize {{him as a}} poor role model for children.

[...] In schools, educators claimed that Bart was a [...] "threat to learning" [...] because of his [...] "underachiever and proud of it" [...] attitude and negative attitude regarding his education. Others described him as [...] "egotistical, aggressive and mean-spirited." [...] In response to the criticism, James L. Brooks said, [...] "I'm very wary of television where everybody <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> role model, you don't run across that many role models in real life.

Reynolds also said that [...] "getting philosophy into the game" [...] was one of the attractions of the game. Believing good science fiction thrives on constraint, the developers began with near-future technologies.

Alien ecologies and mysterious intelligences were incorporated into Alpha Centauri as external [...] "natural forces" [...] intended to serve as flywheels for the backstory and a catalyst for many player intelligences. Chris Pine, creator of the in-game map of Planet, strove to make Planet look like a real planet, which resulted in evidence of tectonic action.

500|$|Spicer says [...] "Roger Moore re-created Bond as an old-style debonair hero, more {{polished}} and sophisticated than Connery's incarnation, using the mocking insouciance he had perfected {{in his role}} as Simon Templar... Moore's humour was a throwaway, and certainly in the later films, verged on self-parody. It was an essential strand in the increasingly tongue-in-cheek direction of the series which became more light-hearted, knowing and playfully intertextual". Chapman noted that Moore was the most comedic of the Bonds, with a more light-hearted approach to playing the character with a mocking wit and innuendo. Additionally, Moore's one-liners were delivered in a way to suggest that the violence inherent in the films was a joke, as opposed to Connery's, which was used to mitigate the violence. Moore explained his approach to the humour by saying [...] "to me, the Bond situations are so ridiculous... I mean, this man <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> spy, and yet everybody knows he's a spy... it's outrageous. So you have to treat the humour outrageously as well".|$|E
