2500|$|Traditionally, {{the most}} common dowsing rod is a forked (Y-shaped) branch from a tree or bush.

The two ends on the forked side are held one in each hand with the third (the stem of the Y) pointing straight ahead. Often the branches are grasped palms down. The dowser then walks slowly over the places where he suspects the target (for example, minerals or water) may be, and the dowsing <b>rod</b> <b>dips,</b> inclines or twitches when a discovery is made.

50|$|In the {{crankcase}} of {{a vehicle}} engine, motor oil lubricates rotating or sliding surfaces between the crankshaft journal bearings (main bearings and big-end bearings), and rods connecting the pistons to the crankshaft. The oil collects in an oil pan, or sump, {{at the bottom of}} the crankcase. In some small engines such as lawn mower engines, dippers on the bottoms of connecting <b>rods</b> <b>dip</b> into the oil at the bottom and splash it around the crankcase as needed to lubricate parts inside. In modern vehicle engines, the oil pump takes oil from the oil pan and sends it through the oil filter into oil galleries, from which the oil lubricates the main bearings holding the crankshaft up at the main journals and camshaft bearings operating the valves. In typical modern vehicles, oil pressure-fed from the oil galleries to the main bearings enters holes in the main journals of the crankshaft.|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} some aspects {{concerning}} secondary metallurgy of steel {{where there is}} little or very inconsistent information in the literature. More specifically, it is devoted to the studies on high temperature phase equilibria in the Al 2 O 3 -CaO-MgO-SiO 2 system, the formation of ladle glaze and the thermodynamics of magnesium in liquid iron. First, the solidification of different slags on MgO based refractories was studied in order to reveal the mechanism behind the formation of “ladle glaze”. The formation of the slag glaze layer was studied by <b>dipping</b> MgO <b>rods,</b> dense or porous, into liquid slags at 1873 K. The rods were thereafter cooled at a predetermined rate. From a later SEM-EDS microscopy, {{it was found that the}} initial slag composition had the most profound effect on the phases found in the solidified slag layer. It was found that the type of MgO rod used and cooling speed had a minor impact on the morphology on the solidified samples. In addition, the slags used in the study were equilibrated at 1773 K, 1673 K and 1573 K in order to get an understanding of the equilibrium phases and their relationship during cooling. On the basis of the experimental results, the mechanism regarding entrainment of exogenous inclusions from the refractory lining was also discussed. Secondly, phase diagram studies in the high basicity region of the Al 2 O 3 -CaO-MgO-SiO 2 system were performed using the quench technique followed by EPMA analysis. The main focus in the study was to find the liquidus surfaces for MgO and CaO saturation at 1773 and 1873 K. Based on the experimental data, phase diagrams for the 25, 30 and 35 mass percent alumina sections were constructed for silica contents generally less than 20 mass percent [...] The results generally agreed very well with previous, well established phase diagrams. In addition, the activities of MgO, CaO and Al 2 O 3 were estimated using the phase diagram information. At last, the thermodynamics of magnesium in liquid iron at 1823 K were studied. In a pre-study, the thermodynamics of Ag-Mg solutions were studied, necessary for the Fe-Mg system. For the Ag-Mg system, two different experimental techniques were used; the vapor pressure method and the gas equilibration technique. The temperature range of the Ag-Mg study was 1573 to 1823 K. It was found that the excess Gibbs energy of this system can be described quite well with a sub-regular solution model. In the Fe-Mg study, the partition of Mg between liquid iron and liquid silver were studied at 1823 K. Using the results from the pre-study, the activity coefficient of Mg in liquid iron and the self-interaction parameter were determined at 1823 K. QC 2011031...|$|R
40|$|The present {{work was}} {{initiated}} to investigate runnerrefractory corrosion by molten steel. The {{aim was to}} understandthe mechanism of inclusion formation during ingot casting. Thework is also of interest to other unit processes in steelmaking, where refractory corrosion and erosion are seriousproblems. The oxides investigated in the present work werealumina, silica and mullite, which are the main components inrunner refractory. In addition, industrial refractory materialwas investigated. Two types of experiments were conducted. The first, "rodexperiments", involved <b>dipping</b> a <b>rod</b> of the oxide into an ironbath containing varying amounts of oxygen. After quenching, therods were examined through SEM/EDS analysis. In the second setsof experiments, the wetting behaviour of molten iron onrefractory oxides was investigated {{by means of the}} sessile-dropmethod. The reactions were followed in static as well asdynamic modes through contact angle measurements. Temperatureand oxygen partial pressure were, besides time the parametersthat were investigated in the present study. Oxygen partialpressure was defined by introducing a gas mixture of CO-CO 2 -Ar into the furnace. The experimental studies were preceded by a thermodynamicinvestigation of the refractory systems, in order to get afundamental understanding of the reactions that occurred. Phasestability diagrams for the systems were constructed based onthe data available in literature. The diagrams showed that thereaction between alumina and oxygen containing iron would leadto the formation of hercynite at a critical oxygen level in themetal. With silica, the reaction would lead to the formation offayalite. In the mullite case, the reaction products would behercynite at moderate oxygen levels in the melt and hercynitetogether with fayalite at slightly higher oxygenpotentials. For all substrates, the contact angles started decreasing asthe surface-active oxygen came into contact with the iron drop. At a critical level of oxygen in the metal, a reaction productstarted forming at the drop/substrate interface. The reactionproducts were identified through SEM/EDS analysis and werefound to be in agreement with thermodynamic predictions. In thecase of SiO 2 substrate, there were also deep erosion tracksalong the periphery of the drops, probably due to Marangoniflow. Alumina-graphite refractory reactions with molten iron werealso investigated through Monte Carlo simulations. The resultsshowed that, with increased alumina content in the refractory,the carbon dissolution into the melt decreased. Further, thewetting behaviour at the interface was found to be an importantfactor to considerably reduce the carbon dissolution fromalumina-graphite refractories. The experimentation was extended to the commercialrefractories used in the ingot casting process at UddeholmTooling AB, Sweden. The analysis of the plant trial samplesindicates that there is less likelihood of a strong corrosionof the refractories {{that could lead to a}} significant populationof inclusions in the end product. The impact of the presentexperimental results on refractory erosion is discussed. Theimportance of the results to clean steel processing anddevelopment of new generation refractories are alsopresented. NR 2014080...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} {{modification}} of paper into an ion- and electron-conductive material, {{and as a}} renewable material for electronic device. The study stretches from investigating {{the interaction between the}} cellulosic materials and the conducting polymer to demonstrating the performance of the conductive paper by printing the electronic structure {{on the surface of the}} conductive paper. Conducting materials such as conducting polymer, ionic liquids, and multi-wall carbon nanotubes were deposited into the fiber networks. In order to investigate the interaction between the conducting polymer and cellulosic material, the adsorption of the conducting polymer poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) : poly(4 -styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) onto microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was performed. Electroconductive papers were produced via <b>dip</b> coating and <b>rod</b> coating, and characterized. The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) / Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) images showed that the conducting polymer was deposited in the fiber and in fiber-fiber contact areas. The X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of dip-coated paper samples showed PEDOT enrichment on the surface. The effects of fiber beating and paper formation, addition of organic solvents and pigments (TiO 2, MWCNT), and calendering were investigated. Ionic paper was produced by depositing an ionic liquid into the commercial base paper. The dependence to temperature and relative humidity of the ionic conductivity was also investigated. In order to reduce the roughness and improve its printability, the ionic paper was surface-sized using different coating rods.  The bulk resistance increased with increasing surface sizing. The electrochemical performance of the ionic paper was confirmed by printing PEDOT:PSS on the surface. There was change in color of the polymer when a voltage was applied. It was demonstrated that the ionic paper is a good ionic conductor that can be used as component for a more compact electronic device construction. Conductive paper has a great potential to be a flexible substrate on which an electronic structure can be constructed. The conduction process in the modified paper is due to the density of charge carriers (ions and electrons), and their short range mobility in the material. The charge carrying is believed to be heterogeneous, involving many charged species as the paper material is chemically heterogeneous.
