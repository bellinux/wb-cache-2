500|$|Kavner has {{frequently}} appeared in Woody Allen films, having roles in Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), Radio Days (1987), New York Stories (1989), Alice (1990), Shadows and Fog (1991), the television movie Don't Drink the Water (1994) and Deconstructing Harry (1997). Allen described her as [...] "a naturally funny person. When {{she does a}} scene, you listen to her and look at her, and the prism through which it's all filtered is funny." [...] Kavner believes he is [...] "a true filmmaker, one that has something to say, continually experimenting on different themes within his own film-making", adding that [...] "anything [...] ever does, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>want</b> to do, [...] I don't even have to read it." ...|$|E

"Now {{that that}} show is just humming and doing amazing {{business}} — it’s the #1 bestselling magic {{show in the}} world as far as ticket sales and the perception that people are experiencing and coming back to see it multiple times — I felt it was in a great place and I could think about television again. Obviously, “Believe” will continue to evolve until its last performance because <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>want</b> to add new magic, I’m always tweaking and transforming it. I missed being on television, I had something new creatively to say, and Spike became the perfect home to do it." [...] Endemol purchased the foreign distribution rights for the show, and was the [...] "most-watched new original series [...] in more than 18 months" [...] according to The Hollywood Reporter.|$|E
500|$|Henson {{received}} help editing {{the film}} from executive producer George Lucas. According to Henson, [...] "When {{we hit the}} editing, I did the first cut, and then George was heavily involved on bringing it to the final cut. After that, I took it over again and did {{the next few months}} of post-production and audio." [...] Henson went on to explain, [...] "When you edit a film with somebody else you have to compromise. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>want</b> to go one way, and George goes another way, but we each took turns trading off, giving and taking. George tends to be very action-oriented and he cuts dialogue quite tight; I tend to cut looser, and go for more lyrical pauses, which can slow the story. So, I loosen up his tightness, and he tightens my looseness." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2017, Holt {{talked about}} {{recording}} the guitar solos, [...] "That's {{one of my}} favorites on the album. I'm never blown away by anything I've done musically. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>want</b> to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've got to let me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E
500|$|People {{are always}} {{using the word}} Illuminati but they're always {{referencing}} it in an incorrect way. People often accuse me of {{being a member of}} the Illuminati and I think in today's pop culture the Illuminati is perceived as a group of powerful, successful people who are working behind the scenes to control the universe. Not people with consciousness, not people who are enlightened. So people were accusing me of {{being a member of the}} Illuminati, and I kept going, wait—so first I had to figure out what that meant...I know who the real Illuminati are, and I know where that word comes from. The real Illuminati were a group of scientists, artists, philosophers, writers, who came about in what is referred to as the Age of Enlightenment, after the Dark Ages, when there was no writing and no art and no creativity and no spirituality, and life was really at a standstill. And right after that, everything flourished. So we had people like Shakespeare and Leonardo Da Vinci and Michaelangelo and Isaac Newton, and all these great minds and great thinkers, and they were called Illuminati...It had nothing to do with money and power. Of course they were powerful, because they influenced people. But their goal was to inspire and enlighten. So when people refer to me as a member of the Illuminati, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>want</b> to say thank you. Thank you for putting me in that category.|$|E

Cribs member Ryan Jarman said: [...] "It must have had quite a big influence on us – pop melodies is something we always revert to. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>want</b> {{to get back to}} pop melodies and I'm sure that's due to that Bee Gees phase we went through".|$|E

The new owners intend to make several improvements, including adding a podcast studio. [...] They hope to begin recording Tony's podcast at Chatter starting May 1, 2017. Kornheiser is quoted as saying, [...] "Did <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>want</b> {{to be part of}} a restaurant? No. But now with a podcast and trying to own my own content, the ability to put it on during the mornings or during the day and to have other people use it, that would be fun for me." ...|$|E
