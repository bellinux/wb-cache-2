[...] The rare Trillium flexipes (<b>drooping</b> <b>trillium)</b> is also protected by law in Ontario, because of its very small Canadian population.|$|E
50|$|Trillium flexipes, the nodding wakerobin, bent trillium, or <b>drooping</b> <b>trillium,</b> is a spring-flowering {{perennial}} that is {{most common}} in the midwestern United States. Scattered populations are found as far east as Philadelphia and {{as far south as}} Alabama, {{as well as in the}} Canadian Province of Ontario. However, it is an endangered plant species in Canada and is rare throughout its Canadian range so that it is protected by law in Ontario. This species is variable, and tends to hang its flower below the leaves in northern areas. Southern strains have a large erect flower. The red or purplish fruit is also showy.|$|E
