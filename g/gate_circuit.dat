50|$|If a {{specific}} type of gate is not available, a circuit that implements the same function can be constructed from other available gates. A circuit implementing an XOR function can be trivially constructed from an XNOR gate followed by a NOT gate. If we consider the expression , we can construct an XOR <b>gate</b> <b>circuit</b> directly using AND, OR and NOT gates. However, this approach requires five gates of three different kinds.|$|E
50|$|The circuit {{topology}} {{also affects}} {{input and output}} impedance. In general, the source impedance is matched to the input impedance because that will maximize the power transfer from the source to the device. If the source impedance is low, then a common base or common <b>gate</b> <b>circuit</b> topology may be appropriate. For a medium source impedance, a common emitter or common source topology may be used. With a high source resistance, a common collector or common drain topology may be appropriate.|$|E

5000|$|An XOR <b>gate</b> <b>circuit</b> can be {{made from}} four NAND gates in the {{configuration}} shown below. In fact, both NAND and NOR gates are so-called [...] "universal gates" [...] and any logical function can be constructed from either NAND logic or NOR logic alone. If the four NAND gates, below, are replaced by NOR gates, this results in an XNOR gate, which can be converted to an XOR gate by inverting the output or one of the inputs (e.g. with a fifth NOR gate). An alternative arrangement of five NOR gates is shown below, in a topology that emphasizes the construction of the function from [...] (noting from de Morgan's Law that a NOR gate is, in effect, an inverted-input AND gate) but this is clearly not as versatile a 5-gate construction of the XOR function as the one derived from the XNOR construction.|$|E
5000|$|Thus piezo {{switches}} {{produce a}} single, brief [...] "on" [...] pulse. This pulse can {{vary with the}} amount of pressure which is applied, since higher pressures generate higher voltages which take longer to dissipate. A capacitor may be used to store the charge in order to lengthen the time constant of the <b>gate</b> <b>circuit</b> and therefore the width of the pulse. With additional circuitry this pulse can be extended further or used to change the state of an output from steady [...] "Off" [...] to steady [...] "On" [...] by toggling a flip-flop.Piezo switches have some interesting advantages over their conventional mechanical counterparts. One is that there are no moving parts, just the small deformation on the front plate and the piezo element (typically a few micrometers). This means the lifetime of such a switch can be ensured to be tens of millions of operations, since there is no wear involved. Another advantage is that they may easily be completely sealed from the environment and thus made weatherproof. They are often constructed with stainless steel housings such that they are resistant to damage by vandals or heavy use.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Power gating {{is widely}} {{accepted}} as an {{efficient way to}} suppress subthreshold leakage current. Yet, it suffers from gate leakage current, which grows very fast with scaling down of gate oxide. We try to understand the sources of leakage current in power <b>gating</b> <b>circuits</b> and show that input MOSFETs play a cru-cial role in determining total gate leakage current. It is also shown that the choice of a current switch in terms of polarity, threshold voltage, and size has a significant impact on total leakage current. From the observation of the importance of input MOSFETs, we propose the power optimization of power <b>gating</b> <b>circuits</b> through input control. I...|$|R

Using a continuous time model, appropriate time derivatives that capture the dynamic behavior of digital signals are defined. These derivatives provide a natural link between the functional and timing components of gate models and highlight the conditional nature of gate delay. The framework subsumes all known dynamic models of logic gates and—through a formal process of functional and temporal abstraction—provides a sound foundation for functional timing analysis.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} choosing the gate sizes or scale factors in a combinational logic circuit {{in order to minimize}} the total area, subject to simple RC timing constraints, and a minimum allowed gate size. This problem is well known to be a geometric program (GP), and can be solved using standard interior-point methods for small and medium size problems with up to several thousand gates. In this paper we describe a new method for solving this problem that handles far larger circuits, up to a million gates, and is far faster. Numerical experiments show that our method can compute an adequately accurate solution within around 200 iterations; each iteration, in turn, consists of a few passes over the circuit. In particular, the complexity of our method, with a fixed number of iterations, is linear in the number of gates. A simple implementation of our algorithm can size a 10000 <b>gate</b> <b>circuit</b> in 25 seconds, a 100000 <b>gate</b> <b>circuit</b> in 4 minutes, and a million <b>gate</b> <b>circuit</b> in 40 minutes, approximately.
