5000|$|<b>Europe</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} called a [...] "peninsula of peninsulas", {{to draw attention}} to the fact that <b>Europe</b> <b>is</b> a relatively small, elongated appendage to Asia, and that a large part of <b>Europe</b> <b>is</b> made up of peninsulas.|$|R

5|$|Going into {{a second}} year without UEFA competitions, {{qualifying}} for <b>Europe</b> <b>was</b> one of the club's top priorities; to improve its competitiveness, Benfica signed {{some of the best}} domestic players, Ricardo Rocha and Petit, but also brought back former players, like Hélder and Nuno Gomes. Jesualdo Ferreira remained as manager for his first full season on the club.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{military}} {{was involved in the}} breeding of Arabian horses throughout Europe, particularly in Poland, Spain, Germany, and Russia; private breeders also developed a number of breeding programs.

5|$|Moravian {{palaeontologist}} Ferdinand Stoliczka {{separated the}} Himalayan {{population as a}} third subspecies, P.g.forsythi, but {{this has not been}} widely accepted and is usually treated as synonymous with digitatus.

5|$|Polio was {{eliminated}} in the Americas by 1994.

5|$|The Stalinist {{occupation}} of Eastern <b>Europe</b> <b>was</b> {{the issue of}} prime concern, and it raised many problems of interpretation. At first, the International held that, while the USSR was a degenerated workers' state, the post-World War II East European states were still bourgeois entities, because revolution from above was not possible, and capitalism persisted.|$|E

5|$|A PlayStation 2 port of the game, retitled Deus Ex: The Conspiracy {{outside of}} <b>Europe,</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} on March 26, 2002. Along with pre-rendered introductory and ending cinematics that replaced the original versions, {{it features a}} simplified interface with optional auto-aim and motion captured character models. There are many minor changes in level design, some {{for the purpose of}} balancing gameplay, but most to accommodate loading transition areas, due to the memory limitations of the PlayStation 2. The PlayStation 2 version was rereleased in Europe on the PlayStation 3 as a PlayStation 2 Classic on May 16, 2012.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} Charles Coulson {{the accumulation}} of wealth and resources, such as food, led {{to the need for}} defensive structures. The earliest fortifications originated in the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. Northern <b>Europe</b> <b>was</b> slower than the East to develop defensive structures and {{it was not until the}} Bronze Age that hill forts developed and began to spread across Europe. In the medieval period castles were influenced by earlier forms of elite architecture, contributing to regional variations. Importantly, while castles had military aspects, they contained a recognisable household structure within their walls, reflecting the multi-functional use of these buildings.|$|E
5|$|After the Portland Rosebuds, an American-based team, {{joined the}} PCHA in 1914, the {{trustees}} {{issued a statement}} that the Cup was no longer for {{the best team in}} Canada, but now for {{the best team in the}} world. Ice hockey in <b>Europe</b> <b>was</b> still in its infancy at this time, so it was without much controversy that winners of the Stanley Cup began styling themselves as the world champions just like in baseball. Two years later, the Rosebuds became the first American team to play in the Stanley Cup Final. In 1917, the Seattle Metropolitans became the first American team to win the Cup. After that season, the NHA dissolved, and the National Hockey League (NHL) took its place.|$|E
5000|$|One {{criterion}} for defining Central <b>Europe</b> <b>is</b> {{the frontiers of}} medieval empires and kingdoms that largely correspond to the religious frontiers between the Roman Catholic West and the Orthodox East.

5|$|After the Treaties of Tilsit of July 1807 Metternich {{saw that}} Austria's {{position}} in <b>Europe</b> <b>was</b> much more vulnerable but believed the accord between Russia and France would not last. In the meantime {{he found the}} new French Foreign Minister, Jean-Baptiste Champagny unaccommodating and struggled to negotiate a satisfactory settlement {{over the future of}} several French forts on the River Inn. Over the following months the reach of Austrian policy, and Metternich's own reputation, increased. Metternich pushed for a Russo-Austrian alliance, though Tsar Alexander was too preoccupied with the three other wars he was engaged in to commit. Over time, Metternich came to see an eventual war with France as inevitable.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{broadcasts}} of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the Voice of America to Central and Eastern Europe, a major propaganda effort begun in 1949 was Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, dedicated to bringing about the peaceful {{demise of the}} communist system in the Eastern Bloc. Radio Free Europe attempted to achieve these goals by serving as a surrogate home radio station, {{an alternative to the}} controlled and party-dominated domestic press. Radio Free <b>Europe</b> <b>was</b> a product {{of some of the most}} prominent architects of America's early Cold War strategy, especially those who believed that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means, such as George F. Kennan.|$|E
5|$|Another old {{structure}} {{removed from}} <b>Europe</b> <b>was</b> proposed for Wyntoon: the great tithe barn of Bradenstoke Priory in England. Most of the priory {{had been used}} by Hearst to refurbish St Donat's Castle in Wales in the late 1920s, but the tithe barn had been crated and shipped to San Simeon for possible use there. Hearst proposed that the unused Bradenstoke barn be incorporated into his great castle, and had Morgan study the possibilities.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} decade of the century, the {{political}} climate in <b>Europe</b> <b>was</b> feverish: the War of the League of Cambrai had begun. The French, under Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours, had sacked Brescia in 1512, the town now in ruins and the myth of Brixia magnipotens shattered. A lively era of humanism and trade was ended, a phenomenon that would affect the rest of the peninsula in the following decades.|$|E
5|$|Austen's novels {{appeared}} in some European countries soon after their publication in Britain, beginning in 1813 with a French translation of Pride and Prejudice, quickly followed by German, Danish, and Swedish editions. Their availability in <b>Europe</b> <b>was</b> not universal. Austen {{was not well}} known in Russia and the first Russian translation of an Austen novel did not appear until 1967. Despite the fact that Austen's novels were translated into many European languages, Europeans did not recognise her works {{as part of the}} English novel tradition. This perception was reinforced by the changes made by translators who injected sentimentalism into Austen's novels and eliminated their humour and irony. European readers therefore more readily associated Walter Scott's style with the English novel.|$|E
5|$|Byzantines availed {{themselves}} {{of a number}} of diplomatic practices. For example, embassies to the capital would often stay on for years. A member of other royal houses would routinely be requested to stay on in Constantinople, not only as a potential hostage, but also as a useful pawn in case political conditions where he came from changed. Another key practice was to overwhelm visitors by sumptuous displays. According to Dimitri Obolensky, the preservation of the ancient civilisation in <b>Europe</b> <b>was</b> due to the skill and resourcefulness of Byzantine diplomacy, which remains one of Byzantium's lasting contributions to the history of Europe.|$|E
