5|$|This species {{lives on}} hard benthic substrates, {{typically}} rocks. <b>It</b> <b>lives</b> on pebbles, sometimes on boulders, and rarely on dead wood. It tolerates mild organic pollution, low oxygen content (down to below 2mg/liter) {{but it does}} not tolerate long periods of droughts, or ice. <b>It</b> <b>lives</b> in mesotrophic waters, and sometimes in oligotrophic waters.|$|E

These include temperate beech rainforest (where it generally keeps to the canopy), wet and dry sclerophyll forest, woodland, Melaleuca shrubland, coastal heath, dwarf alpine conifer forest, sedgeland, buttongrass moors, tussock grassland, as well as fields, orchards and urban parks and gardens.|$|E
5|$|Oecomys sydandersoni is an {{arboreal}} {{species of}} rodent in the genus Oecomys. <b>It</b> <b>lives</b> in forest patches {{in a small}} area in eastern Bolivia.

5|$|This bird is {{classified}} as vulnerable by the IUCN and is threatened by habitat destruction. Since the arid, spiny forests in which <b>it</b> <b>lives</b> are not protected by the Malagasy government, it is losing habitat to slash-and-burn agriculture, charcoal collection, and logging. It is also hunted by the native peoples of Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|This rockfowl is {{protected}} {{in some of}} the areas in which <b>it</b> <b>lives</b> by national parks. Additionally, there seems to be little habitat destruction in Gabon and on Bioko as the locations in these places in which the rockfowl lives is believed to be too inaccessible for future human development. Recent surveys have also discovered new populations of the grey-necked rockfowl.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} known from Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, southeastern Mexico, and western Panama. <b>It</b> <b>lives</b> in humid {{evergreen}} forests that are sometimes interspersed with pine trees. It {{can be found}} at the edges of these forests typically in the middle and higher levels within these trees. It is also normally found only where cloud forest is uninterrupted.|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman (Paleosuchus palpebrosus) {{is a small}} crocodilian from {{northern}} and central South America in the alligator family. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Surinam and Venezuela. <b>It</b> <b>lives</b> in riverine forests, flooded forests near lakes, and near fast-flowing rivers and streams. It can traverse dry land to reach temporary pools and tolerates colder water than other species of alligator. Other common names for this species include the musky caiman, the dwarf caiman, Cuvier's caiman and the smooth-fronted caiman. It is sometimes kept in captivity as a pet and may {{be referred to as}} the wedge head caiman by the pet trade.|$|E

5|$|Depending on {{the species}} and where <b>it</b> <b>lives,</b> the larva either conceals itself under leaves, debris or pieces of wood, hides in a crack or digs a funnel-shaped pit in loose material. As ambush predators, {{catching}} prey is risky because food arrives unpredictably and, for those species that make traps, maintaining one is costly; the larvae therefore have low metabolic rates and can survive {{for long periods}} without food. They can take several years to complete their life-cycle; they mature faster with plentiful food, but can survive for many months without feeding. In cooler climates they dig their way deeper and remain inactive during the winter.|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook plesseni {{is known}} from Pantar and Alor Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It was {{described}} by Erwin Stresemann in 1929. The upperparts are grey-brown and heavily spotted and marked with white, giving rise to a cross-barred pattern on its back. Its underparts have longitudinal white streaks and its tail is prominently barred. <b>It</b> <b>lives</b> in Eucalyptus urophylla woodlands, and has an unusual low-pitched call different to subspecies boobook. Genetic and call analysis show it to be markedly divergent to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified as a separate species.|$|E
5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis, {{commonly}} known as the Lundy cabbage flea beetle or the bronze Lundy cabbage flea beetle, is a species of flea beetle endemic to the island of Lundy, where <b>it</b> <b>lives</b> and feeds upon the endemic Lundy cabbage (Coincya wrightii). Along with the true weevil Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes and an undescribed race of flea beetle Psylliodes napi, it is known only from the Lundy cabbage. The species was first recorded by Thomas Vernon Wollaston in the 1840s, and was named by the Austrian entomologist Franz Kutschera in 1864.|$|E

5|$|Self-decoration is {{employed}} by animals in different groups, including decorator crabs, which attach materials from their environment, {{as well as}} living organisms, to camouflage themselves. For example, the Japanese hermit crab, Eupagurus constans, has the hydroid Hydractinia sodalis growing all over the shell that <b>it</b> <b>lives</b> in. Another hermit crab, Eupagurus cuanensis, has the aposematic orange sponge Suberites domuncula which is bitter-tasting and not eaten by fish.|$|E
5|$|Seychellum alluaudi is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} crab endemic to the Seychelles, and the only true freshwater crab in that country. <b>It</b> <b>lives</b> in rainforest streams on the archipelago's granitic high islands.

If its habitat were to decline in quality, S.alluaudi might become endangered, but it is currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey is arboreal and diurnal, and most often {{moves through the}} trees on four legs (quadrupedal locomotion). <b>It</b> <b>lives</b> in groups containing several adult males, adult females and juveniles. The group size tends to be smaller than that of South American {{squirrel monkey}}s, but is still larger than for many other New World monkey species. The group generally numbers between 20 and 75 monkeys, {{with a mean of}} 41 monkeys. Groups in excess of 100 sometimes occur, but these are believed to be temporary mergers of two groups. On average, groups contain about 60% more females than males.|$|E
