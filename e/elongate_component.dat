40|$|A novel roll-platen {{forming process}} {{described}} in this paper has been proposed {{for the production of}} <b>elongated</b> <b>components</b> to net shape or near net shape. Although significant progress in net shape forging has been achieved in circular and axisymmetric components through flashless forging with completely closed die cavity techniques, similar progress has not been reported for <b>elongated</b> <b>components.</b> The feasibility of this process has been demonstrated through physical modelling experiments with Plasticine. This process essentially consists of a single roll and a flat platen. The platen can move with a speed equal to or higher than that of the peripheral speed of the roll. When it moves with a higher speed, the deformed workpiece becomes curved. With this characteristic, the roll-platen forming process seems promising for the manufacture of curved <b>elongate</b> <b>components</b> to near net shape. This paper presents an investigation of how the curvature is influenced by the speed ratio. The detailed results of curvature, as well as the distribution of generalised strain, strain rate, and mass flow will be given.

40|$|The {{red giant}} L 2 Pup started a dimming event in 1994, which is {{considered}} to be caused by the ejection of dust clouds. We present near-IR aperture-synthesis imaging of L 2 Pup achieved by combining data from VLT/NACO speckle observations and long-baseline interferometric observations with the AMBER instrument of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). We also extracted an 8. 7 micron image from the mid-IR VLTI instrument MIDI. Our aim is to spatially resolve the innermost region of the circumstellar environment. The diffraction-limited image at 2. 27 micron obtained by bispectrum speckle interferometry with NACO with a spatial resolution of 57 mas shows an <b>elongated</b> <b>component.</b> The aperture-synthesis imaging combining the NACO speckle data and AMBER data (2. 2 [...] 2. 29 micron) with a spatial resolution of 5. 6 x 7. 3 mas further resolves not only this <b>elongated</b> <b>component,</b> but also the central star. The reconstructed image reveals that the <b>elongated</b> <b>component</b> is a nearly edge-on disk with a size of ~ 180 x 50 mas lying in the E-W direction, and furthermore, that the southern hemisphere of the central star is severely obscured by the equatorial dust lane of the disk. The angular size of the disk is consistent with the distance that the dust clouds that were ejected {{at the onset of the}} dimming event should have traveled by the time of our observations, if we assume that the dust clouds moved radially. This implies that the formation of the disk may be responsible for the dimming event. The 8. 7 micron image with a spatial resolution of 220 mas extracted from the MIDI data taken in 2004 (seven years before the AMBER and NACO observations) shows an approximately spherical envelope without a signature of the disk. This suggests that the mass loss before the dimming event may have been spherical. Comment: 11 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysic...|$|R

Positional analysis of the various lipid classes indicated that these novel fatty acids were largely excluded from the sn- 2 position of chloroplast galactolipids and seed triacylglycerol, whereas they were enriched {{in the same position}} in phosphatidylcholine. EDA and ETrA are precursors of arachidonic acid (C 20 : 4 n- 6), eicosapentaenoic acid (C 20 : 5 n- 3), and docosahexaenoic acid (C 22 : 6 n- 3) synthesized via the so-called ω 6 Δ 8 desaturase and ω 3 Δ 8 desaturase biosynthetic pathways, respectively.

40|$|This new {{investigation}} {{of the structure of}} NGC 3384 - the multi-component lenticular galaxy member of the Leo Triplet - is based on CCD frames in the BVR bands, on deep Schmidt plates and on long slit spectra. Besides the already known <b>elongated</b> <b>component</b> along the photometric minor axis, the application of an adaptive filter to a NTT CCD image of the galaxy, and the behaviour of the color light profiles, have revealed the existence of a small (r~ 6 "=~ 300 pc) central component aligned to the disk major axis. The shape of the stellar rotation curves and of the velocity dispersion profiles seem also due to the presence of such inner component, which can be a small disk or a secondary bar. After removal of the contamination by the nearby galaxy NGC 3379, the light distribution of NGC 3384 shows a residual asymmetry (~ 0. 1 mag) in the intermediate and outer regions which cannot be attributed to diffuse dust and implies a non axisymmetric distribution of the stars in the disk. The observed asymmetries can be interpreted as a relic of the Spitzer-Baade event which took place about 5 x 10 ^ 8 ^yr ago between NGC 3384 and NGC 3368, and which is invoked to explain the large intergalactic HI cloud observed in the Leo region...|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{emission}} {{from about}} 10 protostellar jets {{has been discovered}} and it appears as a feature common to the most energetic jets. Although X-ray emission seems to originate from shocks internal to jets, the mechanism forming these shocks remains controversial. One of the best-studied X-ray jets is HH 154, which has been observed by Chandra over a time base of about 10 years. We analyze the Chandra observations of HH 154 by investigating the evolution of its X-ray source. We show that the X-ray emission consists of a bright stationary component and a faint <b>elongated</b> <b>component.</b> We interpret the observations by developing a hydrodynamic model describing a protostellar jet originating from a nozzle and compare the X-ray emission synthesized from the model with the X-ray observations. The model {{takes into account the}} thermal conduction and radiative losses and shows that the jet/nozzle leads to the formation of a diamond shock at the nozzle exit. The shock is stationary over the period covered by our simulations and generates an X-ray source with luminosity and spectral characteristics in excellent agreement with the observations. We conclude that the X-ray emission from HH 154 is consistent with a diamond shock originating from a nozzle through which the jet is launched into the ambient medium. We suggest that the physical origin of the nozzle could be related to the dense gas in which the HH 154 driving source is embedded and/or to the magnetic field at the jet launching/collimation region...|$|R

40|$|We present 12. 8 microns {{images of}} the core of NGC 1068 {{obtained}} with the BURST mode of the VLT/VISIR. We trace structures under the diffraction limit of one UT and we investigate the link between dust {{in the vicinity of}} the central engine of NGC 1068, recently resolved by interferometry with MIDI, and more extended structures. This step is mandatory for a multi-scale understanding of the sources of mid-infrared emission in AGNs. A speckle processing of VISIR BURST mode images was performed to extract very low spatial-frequency visibilities, first considering the full field of VISIR BURST mode images and then limiting it to the mask used for the acquisition of MIDI data. Extracted visibilities are reproduced with a multi-component model. We identify two major sources of emission: one compact < 85 mas, associated with the dusty torus, and an elliptical one, (< 140) mas x 1187 mas at P. A. =- 4 degrees from N to E. This is consistent with previous deconvolution processes. The combination with MIDI data reveals the close environment of the dusty torus to contribute to about 83 percent of the MIR flux seen by MIDI.

It must be related to the NS <b>elongated</b> <b>component</b> which is thought to originate from individually unresolved dusty clouds and is located inside the ionization cone.

40|$|We re-investigate the {{lenticular}} galaxy NGC 3384, {{a member}} of the LeoI galaxy group, using HST and multi-colour Calar Alto observations. Various approaches are used to visualize the two known peculiar components, the so-called inner component (IC) and the <b>elongated</b> <b>component</b> (EC), on the HST images. The methods were checked in detail using synthetical images from simulated galaxies. For the first time, we make the IC as well as the inner part of the EC visible on direct images. The results confirm both the bar-like appearance of the inner EC and the quasi-elliptical shape of the IC. The IC resembles an inclined disk where the surface brightness becomes successively shallower towards the centre compared to an exponential profile. The orientation of the inner part of the EC is perpendicular to the major axis of the IC. The broad-band colour indices are shown to be in agreement with model predictions for a 5 to 7 Gyr old stellar population of quasi-solar metallicity. No significant large-scale variations of the colour indices over {{the main body of the}} galaxy are found. We discuss the previously reported colour gradients close to the nucleus and argue that the most plausible explanation is reddening by small amounts of dust though unsharpe masked HST images do not provide significant hints for clumpy dust. According to the episodic dust settling scenario suggested by Lauer et al (2005), the very low dust fraction indicates that NGC 3384 is in a post-activity phase and at the beginning of a new dust-settling cycle.

40|$|We report European Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network (EVN) radio {{continuum}} {{observations of}} ASASSN- 14 li, {{one of the}} best studied tidal disruption events (TDEs) to date. At 1. 7 GHz with ~ 12 x 6 mas resolution, the emission is unresolved. At 5. 0 GHz with ~ 3 x 2 mas resolution, the radio emission shows an extended structure that can be modeled with two components: a core-like component and a fainter, possibly elongated source 4. 3 mas (~ 2 pc) away. Our observations are not conclusive as {{to the nature of the}} components, but three scenarios are discussed. One possibility is a core-jet/outflow morphology, thus making of ASASSN- 14 li the first TDE jet/outflow directly imaged. For this case, the projected separation between the two components can only be explained by superluminal motion, rather than the lower velocities inferred from low-resolution radio observations. However, typical fast moving jets have brightness temperatures ~ 5 orders of magnitude higher than we find, thus making this scenario less likely. The second possibility is that we are imaging a non-relativistic jet from past AGN/TDE activity. In this case a past TDE is preferred given that the spatial extension and radio luminosity of the <b>elongated</b> <b>component</b> are consistent with the theoretical predictions for a TDE outflow. Alternatively, the two sources could indicate the presence of a binary black hole, which would then naturally explain the enhanced TDE rates of post-starburst galaxies.

Roughly perpendicular to that main axis, a South-East to North-West faint extension to the central region is visible. A high density of smaller ionised clouds {{shows up in the}} vicinity of the radiogalaxy. The radial velocity and the velocity dispersion are mapped with a 0. 61 ” spatial sampling. Radial velocities, from 0 to 700 km s − 1, are essentially negative relative to the narrow peak, while velocity dispersions vary from 800 km s − 1 in the inner part up to 2000 km s − 1 at possible bow shock locations as well as in the South extension. Such data are essential to disentangle the various components of these distant sources. The kinematics, roughly similar to that of nearby galaxies, is interpreted by luminous clouds and a dusty disk structure. Measured negative velocities could be used as expansion rate constraints for hydrodynamics models of the radio jet propagation. They may also be due to an overestimate of the systemic velocity, in the hypothesis of a collapsing bright knot at the central bright peak. Information on star formation triggering along the radiojet will be derived from deeper observations. Key words: galaxies: evolution; intergalactic medium; kinematics and dynamics; jets 1...|$|R

The method searches for self-similar image structures that form nonaccidental patterns, for example collinear arrangements. We demonstrate a simple implementation of this idea where self-similar structures are found by looking for SIFT descriptors that map to the same visual words in image-specific vocabularies. This results in a visual word map which is searched for <b>elongated</b> connected <b>components.</b> Finally, segments are fitted to these connected components, extracting linear image structures beyond the ones that can be captured by conventional edge detectors, as the latter implicitly assume a specific appearance for the edges (steps).

With the high-voltage microscope on thick (0. 5 -,um) sections, we have noticed, however, that the so-called wispy fragments are part of a three-dimensional lattice. We contend that this lattice is not an artifact of aldehyde fixation, and our contention is supported by its visability after rapid-freezing and freeze-substitution. This lattice or microtrabecular matrix of axoplasm was found to consist of an organized system of cross-bridges between microtubules, neurofilaments, cisternae of the SER, and the plasma membrane.

40|$|The {{structural}} changes during spermiogenesis were studied on developing spcrmatids in seminal vcsicles and receptacles of Lumbricus terrestris fixed in glutaraldchydc-osmium tetroxide and cmbcddcd in Epon-Aralditc. The centriolc plays a prominent rolc in the morphogenesis {{and organization of}} the microtubulcs of the manchettc and flagellum. Microtubules arising from the ccntriolc extend anteriorly to encase the developing middle piece, the nucleus, and the acrosome. The manchctte not only provides a supporting framework for the cell during elongation, but also may provide the motive force {{for the elimination of}} both nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. The manchettc participates in segregation and elimination of the nuclear vesicle that contains the nonchromatin nucleoplasm. Compartmentalization and conservation may also be a function of thc manchctte since those elements which remain within the framework of microtubules are retained, while all the cytoplasm outside the manchette is discarded. At maturation, the endoplasmic rcticulum {{plays a key role in}} dismantling the manchettc and reducing the cytoplasm external to it. During the early stages of middle-piece formation, six ovoid mitochondria aggregate at thc posterior pole of the spermatid nuclcus. Concurrent with manchettc formation, the mitochondria arc compressed laterally into <b>elongate</b> wcdge-shaped <b>components,</b> and their outer limiting membranes fuse to form an hexagonal framework that surrounds the dense intramitochondrial matrices. Dense glycogen granulcs are arranged linearly between the peripheral flagellar tubules and the outer membrane of the mature spcrm tail...|$|R
40|$|The {{observational}} techniques {{employed to}} search for gravitational lensing effects in highly luminous quasars (HLQs) are given, along with results of the observations. The program, begun in 1986, considers the visible and dark matter distributions at different scales in the universe to determine which extragalactic objects are gravitationally lensed. The Hubble parameter and galaxy masses are determined from the observations, and observations of microlensing effects provide data on HLQ size and structures. The redshifts {{are found to be}} between 1 and 3. 6, with apparent visual magnitudes 16 - 18. 5 and absolute visual magnitudes between - 29 and - 30. 6. About one quarter of the images exhibit either multiple <b>components,</b> <b>elongated</b> structures, jetlike features, or faint nearby galaxies. The double quasar UM 673 and its 'overlying' lens galaxy is given as a prime example of an HLQ that is gravitationally lensed. It is theorized many more HLQs are gravitationally lensed, and specific future observations are recommended...|$|R
40|$|Warped discs {{have been}} found on (sub-) parsec scale in some nearby Seyfert nuclei, {{identified}} by their maser emission. Using dust radiative transfer simulations we explore their observational signatures in the infrared {{in order to find}} out whether they can partly replace the molecular torus. Strong variations of the brightness distributions are found, depending on the orientation of the warp with respect to the line of sight. Whereas images at short wavelengths typically show a disc-like and a point source component, the warp itself only becomes visible at far-infrared wavelengths. A similar variety is visible in the shapes of the spectral energy distributions. Especially for close to edge-on views, the models show silicate feature strengths ranging from deep absorption to strong emission for variations of the lines of sight towards the warp. To test the applicability of our model, we use the case of the Circinus galaxy, where infrared interferometry has revealed a highly <b>elongated</b> emission <b>component</b> matching a warped maser disc in orientation and size. Our model is for the first time able to present a physical explanation for the observed dust morphology as coming from the AGN heated dust. As opposed to available torus models, a warped disc morphology produces a variety of silicate feature shapes for grazing lines of sight, close to an edge-on view. This could be an attractive alternative to a claimed change of the dust composition for the case of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068, which harbours a warped maser disc as well.

40|$|We present {{simultaneous}} {{observations of}} three recurring jets in EUV and soft X-ray (SXR), which occurred in an active region on 2007 June 5. By comparing their morphological and kinematic characteristics {{in these two}} different wavelengths, we found that EUV and SXR jets had similar locations, directions, sizes and velocities. We also analyzed their spectral properties by using six spectral lines from the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board Hinode, and found that these jets had temperatures from 0. 05 to 2. 0 MK and maximum electron densities from 6. 6 × 10 ^ 9 to 3. 4 × 10 ^ 10 cm^- 3. For each jet, an <b>elongated</b> blue-shifted <b>component</b> and a red-shifted component at the jet base were simultaneously observed in Fe xii λ 195 and He ii λ 256 lines. The three jets had maximum Doppler velocities from 25 to 121 km s^- 1 in Fe xii λ 195 line and from 115 to 232 km s ^- 1 in He ii λ 256 line. They had maximum non-thermal velocities from 98 to 181 km s^- 1 in Fe xii λ 195 line and from 196 to 399 km s^- 1 in He ii λ 256 line. We also {{examined the relationship between}} averaged Doppler velocities and maximum ionization temperatures of these three jets, and found that averaged Doppler velocities decreased with the increase of maximum ionization temperatures. In the photosphere, magnetic flux emergences and cancellations continuously took place at the jet base. These observational results were consistent with the magnetic reconnection jet model that magnetic reconnection between emerging magnetic flux and ambient magnetic field occurred in the lower atmosphere.

40|$|Context. Emission and {{absorption}} line profiles which are {{formed in the}} interaction of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars and their circumstellar environment {{are found to be}} variable at various timescales. Aims. We investigate the patterns and timescales of temporal line profile variability in order to explore the dynamical circumstellar environment of the PMS Herbig Ae star V 351 Ori. Methods. We obtained 45 high-resolution (R 28, 000) spectra of V 351 Ori at timescales of hours, days, and months. We analysed the Hα line profiles and also examined the Hβ, NaD 1 and NaD 2 line profiles to explore the nature of the spectroscopic variability. Results. The Hα line profiles showed strong variations over all timescales. The shape of the profiles changed over timescales of a day. Single as well as simultaneous event(s) of blue-shifted and red-shifted transient absorption components (TACs), i. e. signatures of outflow and infall, were also observed in the Hα line profiles. The shortest period of variation in the TACs was < 1 hour. All transient absorption events were found to decelerate with a rate of a few to fractions of m s- 2. The depth and width of the TACs were also changing with time. The presence of <b>elongated</b> red-shifted <b>components</b> at some epochs supports the episodic nature of accretion. Conclusions. Variable emission and absorption components detected in Hα line profiles show the dynamic nature of interaction between V 351 Ori and its circumstellar environment. The Hα non-photospheric profiles of the star most probably originate in the disk wind. Episodic accretion of gaseous material at a slow rate and outflow of clumpy gaseous material are still occurring in V 351 Ori at an age of 6. 5 Myr. Dynamic magnetospheric accretion and disk wind emerge as the most satisfactory model for interpreting the observed line profile variations of V 351 Ori. Comment: Accepted for publication in A&...|$|R
40|$|The present {{observations}} on the now-extinct Thylacinus {{are based on the}} reproductive system of an adult thylacine discovered among the specimens of the Hill collection at the Hubrecht Laboratory in the Netherlands. As in other marsupials, the reproductive tract was characterised by the presence of a uterus duplex and a vaginal complex where the ureters passed dorsally over each lateral vaginal canal to enter the bladder. The lateral vaginal canals each entered a urogenital sinus that terminated in a shallow cloaca. The gross dimensions of the reproductive tract of the thylacine were greater than those of any extant dasyurid marsupial. The distance from the rostral pole of the ovaries to the most caudal extremity of the urogenital sinus measured 25 cm. The distinctive aspects of the reproductive tract included a disproportionate enlargement of the corpus uteri that is without parallel in any other marsupial species. The bodies of the right and left uteri measured 10. 4 cm x 1. 2 cm x 0. 9 cm and 9. 1 cm x 0. 8 cm x 0. 7 cm respectively. The rostro-caudal length of the right and left cervices measured 2. 7 cm and 1. 7 cm respectively. The cervical canals entered the vaginal complex by way of a thick median vaginal septum. The <b>elongated</b> caudal <b>component</b> of the vaginal culs-de-sac lacked a median vaginal septum. As in other dasyurid marsupials, the lateral vaginae and associated vaginal complex were of diminutive proportions in relation to the typical marsupial pattern. The histology of the tract was remarkably good for tissue preserved since 1902 and indicated that the tissues were free of pathological changes. A characteristic marsupial pattern of ovarian folliculogenesis was evident where all but a thin peripheral zone of the cytoplasm of the primary oocyte became vacuolated during the pre-antral stage of ovarian follicle development...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{fractions}} and {{dimension of}} bars, rings and lenses are {{studied in the}} near-infrared (IR) S 0 galaxy survey, which is a sample of similar to 200 early-type disc galaxies, mainly S 0 s. We find evidence that multiple lenses in some barred S 0 s are related to bar resonances {{in a similar manner}} as the inner and outer rings, for which the outer/inner length ratio is similar to 2. Inner lenses in the non-barred galaxies normalized to galaxy diameter are clearly smaller than those in the barred systems. Interestingly, these small lenses in the non-barred galaxies have similar sizes as barlenses (lens-like structures embedded in a bar), and therefore might actually be barlenses in former barred galaxies, in which the outer, more <b>elongated</b> bar <b>component</b> has been destroyed. We also find that fully developed inner lenses are on average a factor of 1. 3 larger than bars, whereas inner rings have similar sizes as bars. The fraction of inner lenses is found to be constant in all family classes (A, AB, B). Nuclear bars appear most frequently among the weakly barred (AB) galaxies, which are consistent with the theoretical models by Maciejewski & Athanassoula. Similar-sized bars as the nuclear bars were detected in seven `non-barred' S 0 s. Galaxy luminosity does not uniquely define the sizes of bars or bar-related structures, neither is there any upper limit in galaxy luminosity for bar formation. Although all the family classes cover the same range of galaxy luminosity, the non-barred (A) galaxies are on average 0. 6 mag brighter than the strongly barred (B) systems. Overall, our results are consistent with the idea that bars {{play an important role in}} the formation of the structure components of galaxies. The fact that multiple lenses are common in S 0 s, and that at least the inner lenses can have very old stellar populations, implies that the last destructive merger or major gas accretion event, must have taken place at a fairly high redshift...|$|R
40|$|VLBI {{observations}} of the nucleus of Centaurus A have been made at two frequencies {{with an array of}} five Australian radio telescopes as part of the Southern Hemisphere VLBI Experiment. Observations were made at 2. 3 GHz with all five antennas, while only two were employed at 8. 4 GHz. At 2. 3 GHz seven tracks in the (u,v) plane with coverage of 6 - 8 hr each were obtained, yielding significant information on the structure of the nuclear jet. At 8. 4 GHz a compact unresolved core was detected as well. It is found that the source consists of the compact self-absorbed core, a jet containing a set of three knots extending from 100 to 160 mas from the core, and a very long, narrow <b>component</b> <b>elongated</b> along the same position angle as the knots. The allowable range for the position angle of the jet is 51 + or - 3 deg, in agreement with that of the radio and X-ray structure on arcsecond and arcminute scales. The jet has brightened at 2. 3 GHz by about 4 Jy, a factor of nearly 3, since the early 1970 s, 1. 8 Jy of which has occurred in the last 2 yr with no discernable changes in structure...|$|R
