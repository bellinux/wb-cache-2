50|$|Main Hall/La Crosse State Normal School was the {{original}} building for La Crosse Normal School now the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse in La Crosse, Wisconsin. The building was constructed in 1909. The office of the chancellor and various administrative departments are in Main Hall.

It was designated a historic site {{by the city of}} La Crosse, Wisconsin in 1984 and is on the National Register of Historic Places as the Main Hall/La Crosse State Normal School.|$|R
5000|$|The Hanging of the Lantern's {{tradition}} {{dates back}} to 1913 when UWL students hung small lanterns in house windows near campus. In 1931, longtime faculty member Orris O. White began a tradition of hanging one large lantern in the Maurice <b>O.</b> <b>Graff</b> Main Hall tower, above the building's south entrance. The act welcomed alumni who had returned home. [...] "We'll hang the lantern in the old college tower over the south door. You won't need {{to look for the}} key - the door will be open," [...] declared White.|$|R
5000|$|In 1931 {{the college}} {{was divided into}} {{separate}} elementary education, secondary education, and physical education divisions. It was also this year that the homecoming tradition of the [...] "Hanging of the Lantern" [...] began at the south entrance of Maurice <b>O.</b> <b>Graff</b> Main Hall. It was created by English teacher Orris O. White who remarked, [...] "We'll hang the lantern in the old college tower... You won't need {{to look for the}} key - the door will be open."The Training School, which had also been referred to as the Campus School and the Model School, moved into its newly constructed building in 1939. The La Crosse State Teachers College Training School Building was later renamed Morris Hall in honor of Wisconsin politician, Thomas Morris. The Training School provided practice and supervised observation for teacher training candidates. 1973 was the last year of operation for the Training School. Rexford S. Mitchell became the college's fourth president that same year, serving until 1966.|$|R
50|$|The {{university}} was founded as the La Crosse State Normal School in 1909, the eighth of nine state normal schools established in Wisconsin between 1866 and 1916 {{for the purpose}} of teacher preparation. Thomas Morris sponsored the bill in the Wisconsin State Senate that led to the university's creation. Initially, the La Crosse State Normal School was authorized to offer two-year programs to prepare students for the teaching profession. Main Hall (now Maurice <b>O.</b> <b>Graff</b> Main Hall), the original building on campus, was constructed the year the school was founded. The La Crosse State Normal School opened its doors later that same year with Fassett A. Cotton as its first president.La Crosse State Normal School students began organizing several extra-curricular activities within two years of the school's founding. In 1910, students published the first campus newspaper, The Racquet, which is still published today. The Physical Education Club was formed in 1912, making it the longest continuous organization in the school's history.The Physical Education Building (now Wittich Hall), the original physical education building, was completed in 1916 after delays due to the start of World War I. This was not the only setback for the school during this period. The school struggled through serious declines in enrollment and funding following World War I and throughout the Great Depression.|$|R
40|$|The serine-protease OMI/HTRA 2, {{required}} for several cellular processes, including mitochondrial function, autophagy, chaperone activity, and apoptosis, has {{been implicated in}} the pathogenesis of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Western blot quantification of OMI/HTRA 2 in frontal cortex of patients with AD (n= 10) and control subjects (n= 10) in two separate materials indicated reduced processed (active, 35 kDa) OMI/HTRA 2 levels, whereas unprocessed (50 kDa) enzyme levels {{were not significantly different}} between the groups. Interestingly, the specific protease activity of OMI/HTRA 2 was found to be significantly increased in patients with AD (n= 10) compared to matched control subjects (n= 10) in frontal cortex in two separate materials. Comparison of OMI/HTRA 2 mRNA levels in frontal cortex and hippocampus, two brain areas particularly affected by AD, indicated similar levels in patients with AD (n= 10) and matched control subjects (n= 10). In addition, we analyzed the occurrence of the OMI/HTRA 2 variants A 141 S and G 399 S in Swedish case-control materials for AD and PD and found a weak association of A 141 S with AD, but not with PD. In conclusion, our genetic, histological, and biochemical findings give further support to an involvement of OMI/HTRA 2 in the pathology of AD; however, further studies are needed to clarify the role of this gene in neurodegeneration. —Westerlund, M., Behbahani, H., Gellhaar, S., Forsell, C., Carmine Belin, A., Anvret, A., Zettergren, A., Nissbrandt, H., Lind, C., Sydow, <b>O.,</b> <b>Graff,</b> C., Olson, L., Ankarcrona, M., Galter, D.
