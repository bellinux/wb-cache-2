To better understand the processes controlling <b>gully</b> erosion and design effective control measures, a {{study was conducted in}} the headwaters of the Birr watershed for three consecutive years (2013 - 2015). Fourteen <b>gullies</b> with similar morphology were studied in three adjacent sub-watersheds. Stabilization measures were applied to 5 of the 14 <b>gully</b> heads. Three <b>gully</b> control measures were compared: a) reshaping <b>gully</b> banks and head to a 45 degree slope with stone rip rap on the <b>gully</b> heads, b) controlling <b>gully</b> bed grade, and c) planting grasses and trees on shallow <b>gullies</b> (i. e., < 3 m deep). Results demonstrated that <b>gully</b> control measures were effective in controlling the expansion of <b>gullies</b> as no further retreat was observed for the 5 treated <b>gully</b> heads, whereas the average retreat was 3 meters with a maximum of 22. 5 m for the 9 untreated <b>gullies.</b> The migration of untreated <b>gully</b> heads produced an average soil loss of 38 tons per <b>gully.</b> Compared with simple reshaping of <b>gully</b> heads, the additional integration with stone rip rap was an effective and low cost measure.

40|$|In many {{forests of}} Northwestern Europe old <b>gullies</b> can be found, but {{few studies have}} {{reported}} their genesis and characteristics. This study investigates these old <b>gullies</b> under forest in the large case-study area of Meerdaal Forest, in the Central Belgian loess belt. The objectives are (1) to determine the spatial distribution of these <b>gullies,</b> (2) to measure their morphological and topographical characteristics and (3) to reconstruct the factors that led to their development. In the 1329 -ha study area, 252 channel-like incisions were mapped. Different types of incisions could be distinguished. Besides small and large <b>gullies,</b> many incisions were sunken lanes or road <b>gullies.</b> These road <b>gullies</b> are aligned along north-south oriented lines, whereas the concentration of old <b>gullies</b> is strongly related to the distribution of archaeological sites. Out of the 252 mapped incisions, 43 large <b>gullies</b> and 21 representative road <b>gullies</b> were selected for detailed morphological and topographical measurements. The characteristics of {{these two types of}} incisions were compared with ephemeral <b>gullies</b> formed under nearby cropland. Significant differences in morphology between the three types could be demonstrated. Ephemeral <b>gullies</b> under cropland and large <b>gullies</b> under forest differ significantly in all measured parameters, except bottom width. Both the old <b>gullies</b> and road <b>gullies</b> under forest have a significantly larger cross section and total eroded volume compared with the ephemeral <b>gullies</b> observed under cropland. This indicates that once formed, the old <b>gullies</b> were not ploughed in nor were they filled by sediment originating in their drainage areas, because of limited sediment production. Comparing topographical characteristics (i. e. slope at the <b>gully</b> head and runoff contributing area) of forest <b>gullies</b> and ephemeral <b>gullies</b> that formed under cropland yields important indications about their formation. The larger sedimentation slope of forest <b>gullies,</b> compared with ephemeral <b>gullies</b> and road <b>gullies,</b> suggests that the forest <b>gullies</b> incised on vegetated slopes as a consequence of runoff from the adjacent plateau, where the forest cover was disturbed. For the old <b>gullies</b> under forest, no relation between slope at the <b>gully</b> head and runoff contributing area is observed, probably because most <b>gullies</b> occur on very steep slopes. When simulating arable land-use in the study area, zones where ephemeral <b>gullies</b> are expected to develop can be predicted using published topographical threshold relationships. Comparing the zones where ephemeral <b>gullies</b> are predicted with the position of old <b>gullies</b> under forest leads to the conclusion that <b>gully</b> incision was most probably not triggered by extreme rainfall events and that they are not of periglacial origin. The observed <b>gully</b> pattern can best be explained by local, anthropogenically determined land-use changes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Ollagüe has two summits, Ollagüe South is 5868 m {{high and}} Ollagüe North 5863 m. The summit {{features}} a summit crater 1000 ft below the summit {{with a narrow}} opening towards the south, which forms the Quebrada El Azufre. The rim of the crater culminates into 5868 m high Ollagüe South. The western rim is formed by several lava domes. These lava domes feature landslide deposits and lava flows that emanate from {{the foot of the}} dome. Originally they were considered to be a single lava dome, before {{it was found that the}} dome is formed by four individual domes. Just north of the summit crater lies another semicircular crater rim which encircles the summit crater on its northern side and whose high point is 5863 m high Ollagüe North. The northeastern part of the edifice is old and affected by glaciation and <b>gullying,</b> while the southwestern part has experienced younger activity and flank collapses. The volume of the well exposed edifice is about - covering a surface area of 260 km2. Ollagüe rises about 2065 m above the surrounding terrain. The volcano has a number of adventive vents on its slopes, especially the northwestern and southeastern slope. These include Ch'aska Urqu on the southeastern slope and La Celosa (4320 m; also known as El Ingenio) on the northwestern. They lie at distances of 4 - 8 km and 1 - 4 km from the summit vent, respectively. The alignment of these subsidiary vents with the summit vents suggests that a N55°W striking lineament influenced their eruption; such channelling of magma along radial fractures has also been observed on other volcanoes such as Medicine Lake volcano, Mount Mazama and South Sister. A normal fault runs across the main edifice but is not aligned with these adventive vents, and the Pastos Grandes-Lipez-Coranzuli lineament intersects with the volcanic arc at Ollagüe. Fault scarps on the northwestern and southeastern side of the edifice also reflect faulting. Overall, northwest trending lineaments exercised a strong influence on the tectonic development of Ollagüe, and may be the path that feeder dykes of the more recent eruptions followed. Tectonic extension occurred on the basement perpendicularly to the lineament.|$|E

The data used were obtained through measurements of the parameters such as gully length, width and depth at four locations. Also examine were slope angles, relief and vegetation of the topography and mapping of the gully patterns. The data were subjected to laboratory and statistical analysis. The findings revealed that factors that influence <b>gullying</b> (process) along the floodplain are rainfall amount, runoff taking advantage of footpaths, wheeled-tracks and soil texture. It was also revealed that human activities such as sand mining contribute to <b>gullying</b> processes by influencing mass wasting processes like slumping through undermining of channel banks leading to caving as well as collapse of channels.

40|$|Environmental {{degradation}} is {{a serious}} problem in Lesotho, Africa. The majority of studies dealing with soil loss and gully erosion have mainly focused on the mechanics of the erosion. However, mountain watersheds are sensitive and vulnerable to degradation and in so being, have large inherent environmental implications. Gully erosion diversifies the micro-topographical and hydrological environment. The severe changes and eventual system degradation incurred as a result of <b>gullying</b> has rarely been quantified. This paper specifically highlights mire phytogeographic responses to valley head degradation at selected sites in eastern Lesotho by comparing patterns observed in gullied mires to those seen in other non-gullied mires. Soil and vegetation belt transects are set up across five mires (2 gullied) in the highlands of eastern Lesotho. The response of many of the plant species to the overall environmental gradient was asymmetrical and unimodal in pattern. The spatial distribution of the soil’s physical properties, topography and vegetation community patterns were found to reflect the spatial mosaic of the soil moisture gradient. The negative impact that <b>gullying</b> has on the ecohydrological regime of the valley heads is evident and is allowing for shrub encroachment. Both the wetland and dryland vegetation communities correlate strongly with the changes in the surface soil moisture gradient. Gully erosion is clearly a threshold phenomenon. Continued grassland degradation, accelerated soil erosion and subsequent <b>gullying</b> of the wetlands will lead to plant and animal diversity loss, decreased livestock productivity, sediment-laden water and shortened dam life-span...|$|E
40|$|Globally, a {{large amount}} of {{research}} has been dedicated to furthering our understanding of the factors and mechanisms affecting gully erosion. However, despite the importance of gully erosion in arid and semi arid regions of Iran there has been no comprehensive study of the geomorphic threshold conditions and factors influencing gully initiation. The aim {{of this article is to}} investigate the <b>gullying</b> processes and threshold conditions of permanent gullies in an arid region of Iran based upon examination of the slope–area (S = αA−β) relationship. The data were collected through field and laboratory studies as well as Digital Elevation Model (DEM) analyses. In total, 97 active headcuts were identified across the three study sites and classified based on dominant initiation process including piping, landsliding and overland flow. Soil properties, including EC, SAR and soil texture, as well as landuse practices were found to be the major factors initiating piping and bank gullies. All gullies initiated by landsliding and seepage processes were found to be located in steep areas (28 – 40 % slope) with their distribution further influenced by the lithology and presence of a cohesionless sand layer within the soil profile. An inverse relationship between upslope area (A) and local slope (S), in which the α and β coefficients varied, was further investigated based on the dominant <b>gullying</b> process and land use. Gullies occurring in the rangelands that were dominated by overland flow had the strongest relationship while landsliding dominated gullies did not have a statistically significant S–A relationship. In comparison to theoretical and literature based relationships for gully initiation, relatively low values for β were obtained (− 0. 182 to − 0. 266), possibly influenced by the presence of seepage and subsurface processes in many gullies. However, this is consistent with other studies in arid regions and may reflect greater potential for <b>gullying</b> in arid zones due to low vegetation cover and high variation in rainfall. In addition, the soil attributes together with land use practices influenced gully initiation thresholds. Application of the solved S–A relation for predicting vulnerable areas to <b>gullying</b> indicates that it is possible to predict the location of gullies with an acceptable level of accuracy; however other environmental factors should be integrated with the S–A relationship to more accurately identify the location of permanent gullies in arid regions...|$|E

Because potential debris flow can often pose more serious disasters, discrimination of potential debris flow <b>gully</b> is important for disaster prevention and mitigation. To build discrimination model of potential debris flow <b>gully,</b> a database of different <b>gullies</b> in quake-hit areas was established and six discrimination indices were selected based on cause analysis of debris flow. Using the database and the six discrimination indices, we built the discrimination model by Fisher Linear Discrimination Analysis method. The discrimination model was used to discriminate the <b>gullies</b> in Jinxihe catchment. Discrimination results showed that the discrimination model was effective and feasible in discriminating potential debris flow <b>gullies,</b> but it still needs further revised and perfected...|$|R
