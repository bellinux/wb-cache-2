Even though varieties of formal financial systems are introduced in our country, many institutions were expanded and more types of financial tools, packages were introduced, our people still operates the <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> systems particularly {{in rural areas}} than urban area. Therefore this study focused on the reasons for <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> system in village level.

In order to achieve the objective, the Akkaraipatu village is selected and issued questionnaire among the 150 people and small business men, data were collected and analyzed by using univariate analysis. The result of the study shows that there is various factors influence in involvement of <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> system in Akkaraipattu village and the system in Akkaraipattu is found in high level.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to {{identify}} a set of regulatory strategies which potentially enhance the effectiveness of government regulation on Henan’s <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> sector, so {{that the role of}} <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> sector can be formalised: the positive economic functions could be enhanced and problematic aspects of the financial activities could be mitigated, which allowing the <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> sector to transform into a more formal, accountable and acceptable financing channel for the residents. To provide a solid platform for the study, various theoretical studies are examined allowing for knowledge on informal finance in Henan, including the definition, the background information and the scale of <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> sector. To put the need for formalising informal finance in Henan, this thesis also examines different perspectives of <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> regulation both in Henan and worldwide. A regulatory framework is provided based on analyses of these theoretical studies. In order to fill the gap between theriacal solutions and actual practices in the context of Henan, it is essential to gather field data regarding Henan’s informal finance and its regulation. The scope of the field research is thus covers an online questionnaire survey of 224 Henan’s residents to gain a general picture of Henan’s <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> sector through seeking their opinions and aspirations. The data generated from the online survey are then triangulated with the considered views of 20 field workers in Henan. The views of the 20 field workers, including the managers of <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> institutions, the government officials and the financial experts are solicited through in-depth interviews. The key findings that emerged out of the field data analysis is that Henan’s <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> sector could be potentially formalised through seven strategies, including expansion of private investment channels and promotion of interest rate liberalisation, reinforcement of government control and legislation over informal finance, reformation of credit culture, establishment of a sound credit history system and integration of formal and <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> institutions. A set of regulatory recommendations based on the key findings is also provided. It is expected that these recommendations, if implemented, would allow Henan’s <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> sector to gain higher transparency and reliability, eventually become an alternative financing channel for Henan’s residents.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the interaction of formal and <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> markets and their impact on economic activity in quasi-emerging market economies. Using a four-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with asymmetric information in the formal financial sector, we come up with three fundamental findings. First, we demonstrate that formal and <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> sector loans are complementary in the aggregate, suggesting that an increase in the use of formal financial sector credit creates additional productive capacity that requires more <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> sector credit to maintain equilibrium. Second, it is shown that interest rates in the formal and <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> sectors do not always change together in the same direction. We demonstrate that in some instances, interest rates in the two sectors change in diametrically opposed directions with the implication that the <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> sector may frustrate monetary policy, the extent of which depends on the size of the <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> sector. Thus, the larger the size of the <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> sector the lower the likely impact of monetary policy on economic activity. Third, the model shows that the risk factor (probability of success) for both high and low risk borrowers plays an important role in determining the magnitude by which macroeconomic indicators respond to shocks.

40|$|The {{informal}} finance {{has been a}} major source of finance from ages long even before the introduction of modern banking system. But its major function is in the provision of {{informal finance}} to agricultural sector. The study examines the problems and prospects of <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> institutions in financing agricultural sector in Nigeria using Ado-Ekiti and Oye-Ekiti Local Government Areas of Ekiti State, Nigeria as case study. This study examines the effect informal finance has on the activities of agriculture in Nigeria. The methodology employed was descriptive and data were collected using personal oral interviews and questionnaires which were distributed to the respondents. The data collected were presented and analyzed using percentages and tables. The use of chi-square was also employed for better understanding. The findings from the study revealed that <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> institutions’ activities have a significant effect in financing agriculture. It also revealed that financial constraint is not the major constraint faced by <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> institutions in financing agricultural sector. Other problems include lack of storage facilities and the use of crude tools, just to mention but a few. Despite these problems, it is noted that the <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> institutions if properly monitored have many goodies to offer for improved productivity of the agricultural sector of the country. As a result of the problems faced by the <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> institutions in financing agriculture, it is recommended among others that there should be more of governmental and financial support to the agricultural sector so as to enhance development, create enabling environment and {{there is a need for}} <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> institutions to improve in their financing function to the sector. It is concluded that informal finance is the “life wire” of agricultural sector...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> markets in Gaborone, Botswana, with specific {{focus on the}} terms and conditions for informal credit, its main uses and the target clientele. The study used primary data, and analytical techniques that included descriptive statistics and analysis of variance. The results show that informal lenders give short-term consumption loans consisting of small amounts, charge very high interest rates, use innovative collateral substitutes such as automatic teller machine (ATM) cards plus personal identification numbers (PINs) and valuable household assets as security, and target mainly the non-poor. The paper makes three policy recommendations: an appropriate regulatory framework for the <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> sector should be developed, interest rates and other charges should be systematically disclosed so as to encourage competition and reduce the high interest rates, {{and there should be}} legislation against the use of ATMs and PINs as security. <b>Informal</b> <b>financial</b> markets, Botswana,...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> institutions {{in the construction of}} trust between Rwandans as well as their influence on their livelihood. For many years Rwandans have suffered from ethnic conflict and poverty. <b>Informal</b> <b>financial</b> institutions require trust between members to function, and this thesis will particularly examine local savings and credit associations, which are known individually as Ikimina and collectively as Ibimina. While scholars have mentioned the role of <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> institutions in passing, they have not shown what makes trust practical and what people who join these institutions become able to do. This thesis fills this gap by discussing trust and capabilities through the experiences and perceptions of Ibimina members. Qualitative interviews, observations and group discussions were used to understand the sources of trust and the influence of Ibimina on capabilities. The thesis addresses two main questions: 1) what is the relation between Ibimina and trust, and what are the factors that determine this relationship? 2) How does participation in Ibimina influence the capability of their members? The empirical findings show that Ibimina and trust are mutually supportive. Trust is created and developed through both structures and interactions, before and after establishing an Ikimina. There are many sources of trust between members of Ibimina. The factors, which most clearly illustrate and define trust between members, are rules, the reputation of individuals and of the group, the relationships between members, group identification and individual characteristics of members. Kinship is not a source of trust between members of Ibimina, which contradicts the literature on <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> institutions. Moreover, the findings show that Ibimina provide the possibility for their members to improve their wellbeing. Members use the pot for investment in small household enterprises and for consumption. This study contributes to existing literatures on <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> institutions and on trust, particularly in the Rwandan post-conflict situation...|$|R

40|$|In China?s bank-based {{financial}} system, {{in parallel}} with formal banking institutions, there is a flourishing <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> market. <b>Informal</b> <b>financial</b> institutions contribute to meeting the ever increasing credit demand of China?s private enterprises {{that seem to be}} neglected by the largely state-owned formal banking sector. Private firms would prefer to borrow at lower cost from the formal sector, but in lack of credit history or credit rating they may be rejected. Smaller firms in non-manufacturing sectors and with lower profitability have less chance to obtain formal credit. Formal and <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> institutions co-exist in China and have different approaches to lending decisions to the private sector. This paper investigates the determinants of the size of formal and informal financing and the conditions of access to formal bank loans across private firms. The result of the empirical analysis suggests that loan officers at formal and <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> institutions take into account different factors when extending loans. While formal banks focus on past performance of the firm, such as credit rating, previous tax payments and credit history, as well as the size of the firm and manufacturing activities, informal institutions put a relatively higher weight on current operations. The amount of receivables is a very important determinant {{of the size of the}} loan extended. Further, informal institutions exploit the information on earlier borrowing from the formal banking sector, suggesting that they may economise on the monitoring costs and that there may be a certain merit of co-existence of formal and informal finance. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{the best}} our knowledge, {{in the first}} {{empirical}} macroeconomic examination of the nexus between financial intermediation and mobile phones, Asongu employs two conflicting financial system definitions {{in the assessment of}} how mobile phones have stimulated financial development in Africa. Within the framework of the dominant International Monetary Fund's International Financial Statistics (2008) definition, mobile phones are established to be negatively associated with financial intermediary dynamics of depth, activity and size. Conversely, when the previously neglected <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> sector is integrated into the conception, definition and measurement of the financial system, mobile phones are positively (negatively) correlated with the <b>informal</b> (formal) <b>financial</b> intermediation sector. The empirical evidence is based on 52 African countries. Causality in the established linkages has been confirmed in subsequent studies by the same author. At least three policy implications derive from the findings. First, the role of <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> intermediation is increasing to the detriment of formal financial mechanisms. Second, in order to capture the positive effect of mobile phones on finance, it is imperative to integrate the missing <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> sector component into the IMF definition of the financial system. Third, it is a wake-up call for more scholarly research on: (i) macroeconomic financial development implications of mobile phone penetration and (ii) monetary policy instruments in the face of burgeoning 'mobile phone'-oriented financial intermediation...|$|R

First, we examine the idea of 'pecking order' preferences for firms' fund raising in developing countries generally and in Thailand in particular.

Next, we estimate the determinants of the capital structure and the investment function. We {{found a lot of}} interesting results. First, the debt ratio of listed firms is lower than that of non-listed firms, which is realised by the increase in the capital surplus gained by initial public offerings. Second, however, participation by firms in the organized securities market accommodates agency costs, not only in equity markets, but also in the market for bank loans as a 'by-product' effect, which reduces <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> transactions. Third, manufacturing firms belonging to the 'financial conglomerate' are surprisingly inactive investors and dependent on <b>informal</b> <b>financial</b> transactions, whereas foreign firms borrow less and invest more. In addition, of the various fund mobilization methods, only bank loans, particularly long-term loans, promptly affect equipment investment by firms. capital structure, investment, financial system, Thailand...|$|R
