40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} and design of a six-component <b>force-torque</b> <b>sensor.</b> The configuration of the sensor {{is based on the}} well-known Stewart Platform manipulator. The key difference between other Stewart Platform based sensors and the one discussed in this paper is the use of a Stewart Platform in a near singular configuration. It is known in kinematics literature that a Stewart Platform at a singular configuration cannot resist some component(s) of externally applied force or moment. At near-singular configurations, a small applied force or moment in certain specific direction(s) can give rise to large forces in the links, resulting in mechanical magnification in link forces. The mechanical amplification enables us to achieve enhanced sensitivity along certain specific directions. This concept is used to design a <b>force-torque</b> <b>sensor</b> which has enhanced sensitivity to the three Cartesian components of externally applied moments.

40|$|Humanoid {{service robots}} in {{domestic}} environments have {{to interact with}} humans and their surroundings in a safe and reliable way. One way to manage that is to equip the robotic systems with <b>force-torque</b> <b>sensors</b> to realize a physically compliant whole-body behavior via impedance control. To provide mobility, such robots often have wheeled platforms. The main advantage is that no balancing effort {{has to be made}} compared to legged humanoids. However, the nonholonomy of most wheeled systems prohibits the direct implementation of impedance control due to kinematic rolling constraints that {{must be taken into account}} in modeling and control. In this paper we design a whole-body impedance controller for such a robot, which employs an admittance interface to the kinematically controlled mobile platform. The upper body impedance control law, the platform admittance interface, and the compensation of dynamic couplings between both subsystems yield a passive closed loop. The convergence of the state to an invariant set is shown. To prove asymptotic stability in the case of redundancy, priority-based approaches can be employed. In principle, the presented approach is the extension of the well-known and established impedance controller to mobile robots.

40|$|Abstract Background Robotics is {{emerging}} as a promising tool for functional training of human movement. Much of the {{research in this area}} over the last decade has focused on upper extremity orthotic devices. Some recent commercial designs proposed for the lower extremity are powered and expensive – hence, these could have limited affordability by most clinics. In this paper, we present a novel un-motorized bilateral exoskeleton {{that can be used to}} assist in treadmill training of motor-impaired patients, such as with motor-incomplete spinal cord injury. The exoskeleton is designed such that the human leg will have a desirable swing motion, once it is strapped to the exoskeleton. Since this exoskeleton is un-motorized, it can potentially be produced cheaply and could reduce the physical demand on therapists during treadmill training. Results A swing-assist bilateral exoskeleton was designed and fabricated at the University of Delaware having the following salient features: (i) The design uses torsional springs at the hip and the knee joints to assist the swing motion. The springs get charged by the treadmill during stance phase of the leg and provide propulsion forces to the leg during swing. (ii) The design of the exoskeleton uses simple dynamic models of sagittal plane walking, which are used to optimize the parameters of the springs so that the foot can clear the ground and have a desirable forward motion during walking. The bilateral exoskeleton was tested on a healthy subject during treadmill walking for a range of walking speeds between 1. 0 mph and 4. 0 mph. Joint encoders and interface <b>force-torque</b> <b>sensors</b> mounted on the exoskeleton were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the exoskeleton in terms of the hip and knee joint torques applied by the human during treadmill walking. Conclusion We compared two different cases. In case 1, we estimated the torque applied by the human joints when walking with the device using the joint kinematic data and interface <b>force-torque</b> <b>sensors.</b> In case 2, we calculated the required torque to perform a similar gait only using the kinematic data collected from joint motion sensors. On analysis, we found that at 2. 0 mph, the device was effective in reducing the maximum hip torque requirement and the knee joint torque during the beginning of the swing. These behaviors were retained as the treadmill speed was changed between 1 – 4 mph. These results were remarkable considering the simplicity of the dynamic model, model uncertainty, non-ideal spring behavior, and friction in the joints. We believe that the results can be further improved in the future. Nevertheless, this promises to provide a useful and effective methodolgy for design of un-motorized exoskeletons to assist and train swing of motor-impaired patients. </p...|$|R
