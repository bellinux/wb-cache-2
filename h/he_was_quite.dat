5|$|Karl Ernst Adolf Anderssen (July 6, 1818 – March 13, 1879) was a German chess master. He is {{considered}} {{to have been the}} world's leading chess player for much of the 1850s and 1860s. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> soundly defeated by Paul Morphy who toured Europe in 1858, but Morphy retired from chess soon after and Anderssen was again considered the leading player.|$|E
5|$|In the 15 {{years since}} he had left Red River, his {{megalomania}} had grown greater than ever. His ungovernable rages, delusions of grandeur, messianic claims, and dictatorial impulses had all become more extreme; but these violent excesses {{were not the only}} symptoms of his curious mental and moral decline. He had lost his shrewd appreciation of realities. His sense of direction was confused in his purposes were equivocal. He showed, at intervals, a cynical selfishness and the ruthless cupidity.... although in public he professed that his sole aim was the redress of the Métis grievances, and private <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> ready to promise that if the government made him a satisfactory personal payment of a few thousand dollars he would induce his credulous followers to accept almost any settlement the federal authorities desired, and would quietly leave Canada forever.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Morrissey {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in film, television and Gene Kelly musicals. After seeing a broadcast of Kes on television, {{he decided to}} become an actor. At his primary school, St Margaret Mary's School, he was encouraged by a teacher named Miss Keller, who cast him as the Scarecrow in a school production adapted from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz when he was 11 years old. Keller left the school soon after, leaving Morrissey without encouragement. His secondary school, De La Salle School, had no drama classes and {{was the sort of}} place where Morrissey thought the fear of bullying dissuaded pupils from participating in lessons. On the advice of a cousin, Morrissey joined the Everyman Youth Theatre. For the first couple of weeks, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> shy and did not join in the workshops. When he eventually participated, he appeared in the youth theatre's production of Fighting Chance, a play about the riots in Liverpool. He went to the theatre on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes; but <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> {{right to}} make a fresh beginning. Poor man! <b>he</b> has <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> lifted off his feet, and entranced all this time, and his {{recovery}} will be much easier elsewhere. It was all that unlucky croquet." ...|$|R
60|$|Lastly, Dickens is even astonishingly {{right about}} Eugene Wrayburne. So far from {{reproaching}} him with not understanding a gentleman, the critic will be astonished at the accuracy {{with which he}} has really observed the worth and {{the weakness of the}} aristocrat. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> right when <b>he</b> suggests that such a man has intelligence enough to despise the invitations which he has not the energy to refuse. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> right when <b>he</b> makes Eugene (like Mr. Balfour) constantly right in argument even when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> obviously wrong in fact. Dickens <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> right when <b>he</b> describes Eugene as capable of cultivating a sort of secondary and false industry about anything that is not profitable; or pursuing with passion anything that is not his business. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> right in making Eugene honestly appreciative of essential goodness--in other people. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> right in making him really good at the graceful combination of satire and sentiment, both perfectly sincere. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> also right in indicating that the only cure for this intellectual condition is a violent blow on the head.|$|R
5|$|Taaramäe {{took over}} the white jersey for best young rider from Rigoberto Urán on stage 18. Urán {{finished}} a distant 27th on the day, seven minutes off the pace of stage winner Andy Schleck. Taaramäe's eighth place, three minutes back of Schleck but four minutes the better of Urán, moved him into 11th place overall and into the best young rider's position, by 33 seconds over Pierre Rolland. Rolland won the stage at Alpe d'Huez the next day, with Taaramäe finishing 14th two minutes back. This gave Rolland an advantage of a minute and 33 seconds going into the stage 20 individual time trial, where Taaramäe's skills are superior. Taaramäe indeed finished better than Rolland in the time trial, tenth to Rolland's 21st, but gained only 48 seconds. This was insufficient to win back the white jersey before the final, largely ceremonial stage into Paris on the Tour's final day. Taaramäe finished the Tour in 12th place overall, at a deficit of eleven {{and a half minutes}} to Tour champion Cadel Evans. Moncoutié was not a major factor in any classification, finishing 41st overall and 25th in the mountains classification. Given his result at just 24 years of age, and that he retains eligibility for the white jersey in the 2012 Tour de France, Boyer expressed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> pleased with Taaramäe's performance, and that he expected the Estonian to be a contender for the overall podium at the Tour within two or three years.|$|E
25|$|Crowe skipped {{kindergarten}} and two grades in elementary, {{and by the}} time he attended Catholic high school, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> obviously younger than the other students. To add to his alienation, he was often ill because he suffered from nephritis.|$|E
25|$|Faisal's {{mother died}} in 1912 when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> young, and he was raised by his {{maternal}} grandfather, who taught him the Quran and the principles of Islam, an education that left an impact on him {{for the remainder of}} his life.|$|E

25|$|Sharpe bowled fast-medium {{and could}} make the ball break back to an unusual degree on hard pitches. His extra-fast yorker was often deadly. Having lost an eye, he had no pretensions as a batsman, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> active {{in the field for}} a player in that time.|$|E
25|$|Siyyid `Alí-Muhammad, {{who later}} {{took on the}} title the Báb, was born on October 20, 1819, in Shiraz to a {{merchant}} of the city; his father died while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> young and the boy was raised by his maternal uncle Ḥájí Mírzá Siyyid `Alí, {{who was also a}} merchant.|$|E
25|$|Yuri Luzhkov is {{a devoted}} Orthodox Christian believer, often {{appearing}} at Christmas and Easter liturgies. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> friendly with Patriarch Alexy II. In 2005 {{he was given}} an award from International Fund of unity of Orthodox Christians. Luzhkov keeps conservative and traditionalist views. He is considered a great friend of the Greek Orthodox Church as well.|$|E
50|$|The main character's brother. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> usually {{known as}} Onii-chan (big brother in Japanese). Onii-chan {{supports}} {{the main character}} through her diet and also makes monthly charts that show how 'in love' the various candidates <b>are</b> with her. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> hot-headed, gets jealous easily, very protective and has an obvious sister complex. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> popular within the fandom. He also gives you a monthly allowance of 5000 yen.|$|R

25|$|Baker {{was born}} in Hertford County on February 15, 1775 to Lawrence Baker and Ann Jones. His mother died when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> young and he {{therefore}} lived for part of his childhood with an aunt in Southampton County, Virginia. During this time he attended the same school run by Rev. Henry John Burges that William Henry Harrison attended.|$|E
25|$|It was at {{this time}} Bellamy {{received}} his nickname. The other men in his billet were introducing themselves and he became embarrassed, thinking that he might suffer some ragging if it was known he was called Lionel so he gave his name as Bill {{and for the rest}} of his life <b>he</b> <b>was</b> (<b>quite</b> happily) known as Bill Bellamy.|$|E
25|$|For {{several years}} Brixttofte was the Mayor of Farum with his party having had an {{absolute}} majority. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> popular and Farum was generally considered a successful municipality {{thanks to its}} success in finding jobs for the unemployed, particularly immigrants. It was held up as having been a good example by Liberal politicians during national elections.|$|E

5000|$|René Auberjonois (Kōichi Kitamura in the Japanese adaptation) as Professor Genius: King Morpheus' advisor and a {{supporting}} protagonist. He {{comes to the}} real world to bring Nemo to Slumberland. A sophisticated man, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> punctual and prefers order as opposed to madness. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> a dancer, as he dances quite a bit during Nemo's coronation ceremony. In the real world, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> an organ player in a circus that stops in Nemo's town.|$|R
25|$|Blackmore {{has come}} down, largely through the verse of Alexander Pope, as one avatar of Dulness, but, as a physician, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> forward thinking. He agreed with Sir Thomas Sydenham that {{observation}} and the physician's experience should {{take precedence over}} any Aristotelian ideals or hypothetical laws. He rejected Galen's humour theory as well. He wrote on plague in 1720, smallpox in 1722, and consumption in 1727.|$|E
25|$|Yuvraj {{was born}} in a Sikh family to Yograj Singh, a former India cricketer, and Shabnam Singh. Tennis and roller skating were Yuvraj's {{favorite}} sports during his childhood and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> good at both. He had also won the National Under-14 Roller Skating Championship. His father threw away the medal and told him to forget skating and concentrate on cricket. He would take Yuvraj to training every day.|$|E
25|$|Emperor Wu {{employed}} {{poets and}} musicians in writing lyrics and scoring tunes for various performances and also patronized choreographers and shamans {{in this same}} connection for arranging the dance movements and coordinating the spiritual and the mundane. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> fond of the resulting lavish ritual performances, especially night time rituals where the multitudinous singers, musicians, and dancers would perform in the brilliant lighting provided by of thousands of torches.|$|E

5000|$|Mumphy: <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> {{the lovely}} baby of his family, {{and has not}} left his planet until now. His {{nickname}} is the [...] "Ball of fire", which fits his appearance well. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> a robe-clad ball with eyes and a mouth, with pink skin colour and a feather on top. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> literally a hothead considering his special item that causes Volcanic Eruptions. In the end, his mother reveals that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> adopted, and shows him {{a picture of his}} real mother.|$|R
25|$|Artashumara {{followed}} his father Shuttarna II on the throne, but {{was murdered by}} a certain UD-hi, or Uthi. It is uncertain what intrigues that followed, but UD-hi then placed Tushratta, another son of Shuttarna, on the throne. Probably, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> young {{at the time and}} was intended to serve as a figurehead only. However, he managed to dispose of the murderer, possibly {{with the help of his}} Egyptian father-in-law, but this is sheer speculation.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Caillebotte {{used his}} wealth {{to fund a}} variety of hobbies for which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> passionate, {{including}} stamp collecting, orchid growing, yacht building, and even textile design (the women in his paintings Madame Boissière Knitting, 1877, and Portrait of Madame Caillebotte, 1877, may be working on patterns created by Caillebotte). After his death, he was inscribed in the Roll of Distinguished Philatelists, and the collection he formed with his brother Martial {{is now in the}} British Library.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> {{brilliant}} in {{the domestic}} circuit, especially in his first-class career. He made his first-class debut in 2009 for Mountaineers against Mid West Rhinos. He immediately made an impression giving away just 25 runs from 7 overs in the first innings with a brilliant economy rate of 3.57. He soon rose to prominence with 71 wickets from just 20 matches. He performed well in other forms such as List A and Twenty20 Cricket, too.|$|E
