40|$|In {{this paper}} a three-country model based on intertemporal maximizing {{behavior}} is constructed {{in order to}} analyze the effects of oil price increases on welfare levels and trade balance positions. The model {{can also be used}} to assess the effects of oil price increases on the world interest rate, on the final <b>goods</b> <b>terms</b> of trade between oil importers (what is sometimes called the real exchange rate), and on output, investment and savings levels, oil imports, wages, and consumption at each date. The analysis highlights the role of structural asymmetries between oil importers in accounting for differences in trade balance responses. A number of structural differences are isolated in turn in order to determine their influence on the final <b>goods</b> <b>terms</b> of trade, which is the key factor in affecting relative trade balance positions. ...|$|R

40|$|Is the {{relative}} price of investment goods a good proxy for investment frictions? We analyze investment frictions {{in an open}} economy, flexible price, two-country model and show that when {{the relative}} price of investment goods is endogenously determined in such a model, the relative price of investment can actually rise {{in response to a}} reduction in investment frictions.

40|$|We {{develop a}} class of models within the pricing kernel framework, i. e., we model the pricing kernel directly, and not a {{particular}} interest rate or a set of rates. The construction of the kernel is explicitly linked to the calibrating set of instruments. Thus, once the kernel is constructed it will price correctly the chosen set of instruments, and have a low-dimensional Markov structure. We test our model on yield, at-the-money cap, caplet implied volatility surface, and swaption data.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of a change task, software developers search the source code to locate the places relevant to the task. As previous research and a small exploratory study that we conducted show, developers perform poorly in identifying <b>good</b> search <b>terms</b> and therefore waste a lot of time querying and exploring irrelevant code. To support developers in this step, we present an approach to automatically identify <b>good</b> search <b>terms.</b> Based on existing work and an analysis of change tasks, we derived heuristics, determined their relevancy and used the results to develop our approach. For a preliminary evaluation, we conducted a study with ten developers working on open source change tasks. Our approach was able to identify <b>good</b> search <b>terms</b> for all tasks and outperformed the searches of the participants, illustrating the potential of our approach. In addition, since the used heuristics are solely based on textual features of change tasks, our approach is easy and generally applicable and can leverage much of the existing work on feature location...|$|R

5|$|According to Israeli {{historian}} Shai Lachman, between 1921 and 1935 al-Qassam often {{cooperated with}} Hajj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. They were initially on <b>good</b> <b>terms,</b> and al-Qassam's various official appointments required the mufti's prior consent. He suggests their cooperation increased after the 1929 riots, {{in which one}} source claims al-Qassam's men were active. The two fell out in the mid-1930s, perhaps due to al-Qassam's independent line of activism. In 1933, al-Qassam sent an emissary to al-Husseini, requesting the latter's participation in a revolt against the British. At the time, al-Husseini refused, preferring a political solution.|$|E
