6000|$|I use, {{however, the}} word [...] "line" [...] rather than [...] "space" [...] {{in the second}} and third heads of our general scheme, at p. 94, because you cannot limit a <b>flat</b> <b>tint</b> but by a line, or the locus of a line: whereas a gradated tint, {{expressive}} of mass, may be lost at its edges in another, without any fixed limit; and practically is so, in the works of the greatest masters.|$|E
60|$|The decorations tended {{towards the}} artistic {{gymnastics}} prevalent {{in some quarters}} at the present day. Upon a general <b>flat</b> <b>tint</b> of duck's-egg green appeared quaint patterns of conventional foliage, and birds, done in bright auburn, several shades nearer to redbreast-red than was Ethelberta's hair, which was thus thrust further towards brown by such juxtaposition--a possible reason for the choice of tint. Upon the glazed tiles within the chimney-piece were the forms of owls, bats, snakes, frogs, mice, spiders in their webs, moles, and other objects of aversion and darkness, shaped in black and burnt in after the approved fashion.|$|E
6000|$|And {{especially}} I must explain, {{and ask you}} to {{note the}} sense in which I use the word [...] "mass." [...] Artists usually employ that word to express the spaces of light and darkness, or of colour, into which a picture is divided. But this habit of theirs arises partly from their always speaking of pictures in which the lights represent solid form. If they had instead been speaking of flat tints, as, for instance, of the gold and blue in this missal page, they would not have called them [...] "masses," [...] but [...] "spaces" [...] of colour. Now both for accuracy and convenience' sake, you will find it well to observe this distinction, and to call a simple <b>flat</b> <b>tint</b> a space of colour; and only the representation of solid or projecting form a mass.|$|E

6000|$|... 160. It {{may make}} this more {{believable}} {{to you if}} I put beside each other a piece of detail from each school. I gave you the St. John of Cima da Conegliano for a type of the colour school. Here is my own study of the sprays of oak which rise against the sky {{of it in the}} distance, enlarged to about its real size (Edu. 12). I hope to draw it better for you at Venice; but this will show you with what perfect care the colourist has followed the outline of every leaf in the sky. Beside, I put a chiaroscurist drawing (at least, a photograph of one), Dürer's from nature, of the common wild wall-cabbage (Edu. 32). It is the most perfect piece of delineation by <b>flat</b> <b>tint</b> I have ever seen, in its mastery of the perspective of every leaf, and its attainment almost of the bloom of texture, merely by its exquisitely tender and decisive laying of the colour. These two examples ought, I think, to satisfy you as to the precision of outline of both schools, and the power of expression which may be obtained by flat tints laid within such outline.|$|E
6000|$|... 33. Having thus {{obtained}} {{the power of}} laying on a tolerably <b>flat</b> <b>tint,</b> you must try to lay on a gradated one. Prepare the color {{with three or four}} teaspoonfuls of water; then, when it is mixed, pour away about two-thirds of it, keeping a teaspoonful of pale color. Sloping your paper as before, draw two pencil lines all the way down, leaving a space between them of the width of a square on your chess-board. Begin {{at the top of your}} paper, between the lines; and having struck on the first brushful of color, and led it down a little, dip your brush deep in water, and mix up the color on the plate quickly with as much more water as the brush takes up at that one dip: then, with this paler color, lead the tint farther down. Dip in water again, mix the color again, and thus lead down the tint, always dipping in water once between each replenishing of the brush, and stirring the color on the plate well, but as quickly as you can. Go on until the color has become so pale that you cannot see it; then wash your brush thoroughly in water, and carry the wave down a little farther with that, and then absorb it with the dry brush, and leave it to dry.|$|E
6000|$|... 186. I {{have only}} one thing more to advise you, namely, never to color petulantly or hurriedly. You will not, indeed, be able, if you attend {{properly}} to your coloring, to get anything like the quantity of form you could in a chiaroscuro sketch; nevertheless, {{if you do not}} dash or rush at your work, nor do it lazily, you may always get enough form to be satisfactory. An extra quarter of an hour, distributed in quietness {{over the course of the}} whole study, may just make the difference between a quite intelligible drawing, and a slovenly and obscure one. If you determine well beforehand what outline each piece of color is to have, and, when it is on the paper, guide it without nervousness, as far as you can, into the form required; and then, after it is dry, consider thoroughly what touches are needed to complete it, before laying one of them on; you will be surprised to find how masterly the work will soon look, as compared with a hurried or ill-considered sketch. In no process that I know of--least of all in sketching--can time be really gained by precipitation. It is gained only by caution; and gained in all sorts of ways; for not only truth of form, but force of light, is always added by an intelligent and shapely laying of the shadow colors. You may often make a simple <b>flat</b> <b>tint,</b> rightly gradated and edged, express a complicated piece of subject without a single retouch. The two Swiss cottages, for instance, with their balconies, and glittering windows, and general character of shingly eaves, are expressed in Fig. 30 with one tint of gray, and a few dispersed spots and lines of it; all of which you ought to be able to lay on without more than thrice dipping your brush, and without a single touch after the tint is dry.|$|E

50|$|The painter's {{evolution}} continued {{during all}} his life: up to 1946, {{the year of}} his marriage, expressive painting; then from 1946 to 1952, a very coloured painting especially in Algeria. From 1952 to 1965, his landscapes were very constructed, the objects defined by black contours with some <b>flat</b> <b>tints</b> in the knife. During this period, he initially painted close {{to his home in}} Paris and Saint-Mandé and also the Cap Gris Nez sober and dark paintings of storms, of boats on the beach, ruins of the war. He also painted characters: clowns, poultry stockbreeders, sailors. Then, from 1958 to 1965, he painted in Cadaqués (Spain) every summer. It is always the same style, firmly framed, but where pass the light and the colors sharp of the Mediterranean (landscapes, navy, portraits, crowd on the beach).|$|R
5000|$|These {{are a few}} of his {{illustration}} suites: In 1864 {{he began}} to illustrate a series of sixpenny toy books of nursery rhymes in three colours for Edmund Evans. He was allowed more freedom in a series beginning with The Frog Prince (1874) which showed markedly the influence of Japanese art, and of a long visit to Italy following on his marriage in 1871. His work was characterized by sharp outlines and <b>flat</b> <b>tints.</b> The Baby's Opera was a book of English nursery songs planned in 1877 with Evans, and a third series of children's books with the collective title Romance of the Three R's provided a regular course of instruction in art for the nursery. In his early [...] "Lady of Shalott", the artist had shown his preoccupation with unity of design in book illustration by printing {{in the words of the}} poem himself, in the view that this union of the calligrapher's and the decorator's art was one secret of the beauty of the old illuminated books.|$|R
60|$|Secondly, {{even in the}} {{earliest}} periods, among powerful nations, this linear decoration {{is more or less}} filled with chequered or barred shade, and begins at once to represent animal or floral form, by filling its outlines with flat shadow, or with flat colour. And here we instantly find two great divisions of temper and thought. The Greeks look upon all colour first as light; they are, as compared with other races, insensitive to hue, exquisitely sensitive to phenomena of light. And their linear school passes into one of flat masses of light and darkness, represented in the main by four tints,--white, black, and two reds, one brick colour, more or less vivid, the other dark purple; these two standing mentally their favourite +porphyreos+ colour, in its light and dark powers. On the other hand, many of the Northern nations are at first entirely insensible to light and shade, but exquisitely sensitive to colour, and their linear decoration is filled with <b>flat</b> <b>tints,</b> infinitely varied, but with no expression of light and shade. Both these schools have a limited but absolute perfection of their own, and their peculiar successes can in no wise be imitated, except by the strictest observance of the same limitations.|$|R
40|$|Digital {{production}} {{colour printing}} {{is now more}} than ten years old. The first implementations of this technology from Indigo and Xeikon started the market but they suffered problems with reliability,quality and overall running costs. They produced a very good-looking printed image but it was notcomparable to offset. Quality problems were that tints often were streaky or banded, <b>flat</b> <b>tints</b> did notreproduce well, and the overall image had a somewhat harsh reflective look. Ongoing developments of digital colour printing mainly from Xerox and Canon developed the marketand improved the economics of the process. Certain elements of the quality also improved. Indigoand Xeikon also showed significant quality improvements and better economics. The improvedquality came closer to the look of offset, but in most cases was still obviously printed digitally. New developments are happening in what is termed "Digital Colour Lite. " This is a range of new slower presses coming from Japan which run at around 30 pages/minute and cost well under 50. 000 Euro. A few of these are getting almost offset quality through the use of new chemical toners that significantly improve printing quality. At {{the same time as the}} quality of digital colour printing has improved, so have the cost economics of running the presses.

You will be {{perhaps also}} troubled, in these first essays at pencil drawing, by noticing that more {{delicate}} gradations are got {{in an instant}} by a chance touch of the india-rubber, than by an hour's labor with the point; and you may wonder why I tell you to produce tints so painfully, which might, it appears, be obtained with ease. But there are two reasons: the first, that {{when you come to}} draw forms, you must be able to gradate with absolute precision, in whatever place and direction you wish; not in any wise vaguely, as the india-rubber does it: and, secondly, that all natural shadows are more or less mingled with gleams of light. In the darkness of ground there is the light of the little pebbles or dust; in the darkness of foliage, the glitter of the leaves; in the darkness of flesh, transparency; in that of a stone, granulation: in every case there is some mingling of light, which cannot be represented by the leaden tone which you get by rubbing, or by an instrument known to artists as the [...] "stump." [...] When you can manage the point properly, you will indeed be able to do much also with this instrument, or with your fingers; but then you will have to retouch the <b>flat</b> <b>tints</b> afterwards, so as to put life and light into them, and that can only be done with the point.

6000|$|If you are {{interested}} in architecture, and wish to make it your chief study, you should draw much from photographs of it; and then from the architecture itself, with the same completion of detail and gradation, only keeping the shadows of due paleness, in photographs they are always about four times as dark as they ought to be; and treat buildings with as much care and love as artists do their rock foregrounds, drawing all the moss and weeds, and stains upon them. But if, without caring to understand architecture, you merely want the picturesque character of it, {{and to be able to}} sketch it fast, you cannot do better than take Prout for your exclusive master; only do not think that you are copying Prout by drawing straight lines with dots at the end of them. Get first his [...] "Rhine," [...] and draw the subjects that have most hills, and least architecture in them, with chalk on smooth paper, till you can lay on his broad <b>flat</b> <b>tints,</b> and get his gradations of light, which are very wonderful; then take up the architectural subjects in the [...] "Rhine," [...] and draw again and again the groups of figures, &c., in his [...] "Microcosm," [...] and [...] "Lessons on Light and Shadow." [...] After that, proceed to copy the grand subjects in the sketches in [...] "Flanders and Germany;" [...] or in [...] "Switzerland and Italy," [...] if you cannot get the Flanders; but the Switzerland is very far inferior. Then work from Nature, not trying to Proutise Nature, by breaking smooth buildings into rough ones, but only drawing what you see, with Prout's simple method and firm lines. Don't copy his coloured works. They are good, but not at all equal to his chalk and pencil drawings, and you will become a mere imitator, and a very feeble imitator, if you use colour at all in Prout's method. I have not space to explain why this is so, it would take a long piece of reasoning; trust me for the statement.|$|R
6000|$|... 143. And {{while you}} are {{learning}} to measure, and to draw, and lay <b>flat</b> <b>tints,</b> with the brush, you must also get easy command of the pen; for {{that is not only}} the great instrument for the first sketching, but its right use is the foundation of the art of illumination. In nothing is fine art more directly founded on utility than in the close dependence of decorative illumination on good writing. Perfect illumination is only writing made lovely; the moment it passes into picture-making it has lost its dignity and function. For pictures, small or great, if beautiful, ought not to be painted on leaves of books, to be worn with service; and pictures, small or great, not beautiful, should be painted nowhere. But to make writing itself beautiful,--to make the sweep of the pen lovely,--is the true art of illumination; and I particularly wish you to note this, because it happens continually that young girls who are incapable of tracing a single curve with steadiness, much more of delineating any ornamental or organic form with correctness, think that work, which would be intolerable in ordinary drawing, becomes tolerable when it is employed for the decoration of texts; and thus they render all healthy progress impossible, by protecting themselves in inefficiency under the shield of good motive. Whereas the right way of setting to work is to make themselves first mistresses of the art of writing beautifully; and then to apply that art in its proper degrees of development to whatever they desire permanently to write. And it is indeed a much more truly religious duty for girls to acquire a habit of deliberate, legible, and lovely penmanship in their daily use of the pen, than to illuminate any quantity of texts. Having done so, they may next discipline their hands into the control of lines of any length, and, finally, add the beauty of colour and form to the flowing of these perfect lines. But it is only after years of practice {{that they will be able}} to illuminate noble words rightly for the eyes, as it is only after years of practice that they can make them melodious rightly, with the voice.|$|R
50|$|At {{the request}} of General Lyautey, who was the Resident-General of French Morocco, {{he picked up his}} brushes again, which he hadn't touched since war was declared. From his terrace he painted the city of Fez at every hour of the day, the walls of which were {{achieved}} using solid material, that he built up with the knife and synthesised in the extreme, becoming a juxtaposition of rectangles, which rigorously delimit the segments of lines drawn with the ruler. However, he also painted Fez's empty or busy alleys, its beggars, its water carriers, its black slaves or its women wearing haiks, but always as a respectful witness who would never strive for intimacy to unveil a look or the body. He also painted Rabat, in whose masterly canvasses highly impregnated with decorative arrangements, he captured the women veiled in white and seated on the terraces of the houses. In response to the vast, <b>flat</b> bluish <b>tint</b> of the façade, which occupies {{the main part of the}} composition, their compact outlines are grouped together in the upper half of the painting. Finally he painted Marrakech, where he mainly captured the processions of donkeys or camels in front of the high walls; and the palm trees whose foliage falls within a perfect circle drawn with a pair of compasses.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} of Flinck's authentic pieces is {{a portrait}} of a lady, dated 1636, in the gallery of Brunswick. His first subject picture is the Blessing of Jacob (1638), in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. Both are thoroughly Rembrandtesque in effect as well as in vigour of touch and warmth of flesh tints. The four civic guards of 1642, and the twelve musketeers with their president in an arm-chair (1648); in the Stadhuis, Amsterdam, are fine specimens of composed portrait groups. But the best of Flinck's productions in this style is the peace of Münster in the Rijksmuseum, a canvas with 19 life-size figures full of animation in the faces, [...] "radiant with Rembrandtesque colour," [...] and admirably distributed. Flinck here painted his own likeness to the left in a doorway. The mannered period of Flinck is amply illustrated in the Marcus Curius Dentatus refuses the gifts of the Samnites, and Solomon receiving Wisdom, in the Palace on the Dam at Amsterdam. Here it is that Flinck shows most defects, being faulty in arrangement, gaudy in <b>tint,</b> <b>flat</b> and shallow in execution, that looks {{as if it had been}} smeared with violet powder and rouge.|$|R
6000|$|... 177. Here, then, is the {{practical}} advice which I would venture to deduce from what I {{have tried to}} show you. Use Greek art as a first, not a final, teacher. Learn to draw carefully from Greek work; above all, to place forms correctly, and to use light and shade tenderly. Never allow yourselves black shadows. It is easy to make things look round and projecting; but the things to exercise yourselves in are the placing of the masses, and the modelling of the lights. It is an admirable exercise to take a pale wash of color for all the shadows, never reinforcing it everywhere, but drawing the statue {{as if it were}} in far distance, making all the darks one <b>flat</b> pale <b>tint.</b> Then model from those into the lights, rounding as well as you can, on those subtle conditions. In your chalk drawings, separate the lights from the darks at once all over; then reinforce the darks slightly where absolutely necessary, and put your whole strength on the lights and their limits. Then, when you have learned to draw thoroughly, take one master for your painting, as you would have done necessarily in old times by being put into his school (were I to choose for you, it should be among six men only--Titian, Correggio, Paul Veronese, Velasquez, Reynolds, or Holbein). If you are a landscapist, Turner must be your only guide (for no other great landscape painter has yet lived); and having chosen, do your best to understand your own chosen master, and obey him, and no one else, till you have strength to deal with the nature itself round you, and then, be your own master, and see with your own eyes. If you have got masterhood or sight in you, that is the way {{to make the most of}} them; and if you have neither, you will at least be sound in your work, prevented from immodest and useless effort, and protected from vulgar and fantastic error.|$|R
