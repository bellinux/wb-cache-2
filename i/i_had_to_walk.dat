500|$|... "Fortress/Deer Park" [...] {{starts with}} a Casio VL-1 rhythm preset, the same as used by Trio on the 1982 hit single [...] "Da Da Da". Its lyrics form a broad and jaundiced look at English culture and subcultures in the early 1980s. It {{mentions}} [...] "Good King Harry was there, fucking Jimmy Savile" [...] while the lines [...] "I took a walk down W11; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> through 500 European punks" [...] are a dry put-down of the fashion-oriented.|$|E
2500|$|... “Gold {{and honey}} {{indicate}} {{a transformation of}} the head, and therefore, naturally and logically, the brain and our understanding of thought, consciousness {{and all the other}} levels necessary to explain pictures to a hare: the warm stool insulated with felt…and the iron sole with the magnet. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> on this sole when I carried the hare round from picture to picture, so along with the strange limp came the clank of iron on the hard stone floor—that was all that broke the silence, since my explanations were mute… ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> {{for an hour}} or so, before I {{was cool}} enough to go home.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not! He didn't mean it. Now, can't {{you send}} word {{down and have}} my trunk brought up? Or shall <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> down?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My horse {{has fallen}} and broken its neck," [...] Fergus said, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> some miles on foot. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{important}} despatches <b>to</b> carry to Vienna. Bring round a horse, without a moment's delay." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{was brought}} up and taught in the [...] "old world" [...] {{tradition}} -- and so it's {{difficult for me to}} change and {{be a part of this}} new world. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> in the shoes to which I am accustomed. David K. Rubins ...|$|R
6000|$|... "John, I don't want {{anything}} that is not my own; not though <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> out to earn my bread in the streets to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed I am not. But he knew <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> {{all this}} way home, and he could take up Margaret, who has only half the distance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Somebody {{introduced}} her to me, and then <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> about the grounds with her. That's {{the kind of thing}} one always does in those places." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Northmour," [...] I said (we still {{continued}} {{to talk in}} whispers), [...] "it {{is not possible to}} endure this suspense. I prefer death fifty times over. Stay you here to watch the pavilion; I will go forward and make sure, if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> right into their camp." ...|$|R
5000|$|Veronica Izotova recalled, [...] "I {{put on a}} red make-up using a brick. My {{face was}} dirty, my sad eyes, my clothes torn, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> many hours... <b>I</b> wanted to play the Snow Queen. I was always more {{expressive}} and more sensitive than the average of my compatriots." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because, Lady," [...] he answered, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> yonder road it {{is safer}} {{to do so}} in my stockings. Have no fear," [...] he added gently, [...] "from boyhood <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been {{accustomed}} <b>to</b> such feats, and when I served in my country's army it was my pleasure to give instruction in them, although it is true that this one surpasses all that ever I attempted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it only think, Colonel? Faith, I {{would go}} down for it myself, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> with pays in my boots and to carry it back on me shoulders. Can I find Herrara there?" [...] he asked.|$|E
6000|$|People {{have been}} paying a mighty price for tickets--as much as [...] fifteen guineas has been offered, I hear. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> up to the [...] gates; the number of coaches {{struggling}} outside prevented my driving [...] near. It was {{as bad as the}} battle of Vitoria itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, if I {{thought all}} Europe was {{surrounded}} by volcanoes, I'd go home at once, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk.</b> But the geographies don't mention many of these spouters, so we may as well stick out our present experience and hope {{the rest of the}} continent will behave better. The Major'll be worried to death when he hears of this." ...|$|E
60|$|Mill. As far as Grays-Inn walks: Now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> time <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> {{the other}} way, and see thy master.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's {{very good}} of you, Mr. Jerome; but I assure you I think walking does me no harm. It is rather {{a relief to}} me after {{speaking}} or writing. You know <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no great circuit to make. The farthest distance <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> is <b>to</b> Milby Church, and if ever I want a horse on a Sunday, I hire Radley's, who lives not many hundred yards from me.' ...|$|R
60|$|Aunt Martha {{would be}} in danger of taking a fit if she ever saw me talking to a man. She watches me jealously, firmly {{determined}} to guard me from any possible attack of a roaring and ravening lion in the disguise of nineteenth-century masculine attire. So <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> demurely and assume a virtue, if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> it not, while I pine after the untested flesh-pots of Egypt in secret.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose he}} {{thought we had}} come to the hotel that he had mentioned, for he got out without another word, and {{followed}} me down the garden. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little top-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the front room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the daughter were walking in front of us.|$|E
6000|$|It was the Sunday evening, and I {{had ridden}} {{over from the}} camp. There were several of our fellows who were visiting the village, and we all left our horses at the inn. Thence <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> to the Ravons, which was only {{separated}} by a single very large field extending to the very door. I {{was about to start}} when the landlord ran after me. [...] "Excuse me, lieutenant," [...] said he, [...] "it is farther by the road, and yet I should advise you to take it." ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{came down}} the hill from Clayton Crest--for my {{shilling}} and a penny only permitted my traveling by train as far as Two-Mile Stone, and thence <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> over the hill--I remember very vividly a little man with a shrill voice who was preaching under a gas-lamp against a hoarding to a thin crowd of Sunday evening loafers. He was a short man, bald, with a little fair curly beard and hair and watery blue eyes, and he was preaching {{that the end of}} the world drew near.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm bound <b>to</b> go if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> {{the rest}} of the way," [...] he said. [...] "I thought I would strike your uncle again when we reached the place, but if you are so dead set against me I'll not say another word, but try to paddle my own canoe, as the saying is. Of course I'm much obliged for what you did for me in San Francisco and here, and some day I'll make it up to you, see if I don't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not {{so young}} as I was. It {{was a warm}} evening, and I 'adn't got even a bus fare on me. <b>I</b> <b>'ad</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> all the way, and, by the time I got there, I was 'arf melted. It was a tidy-sized shop, {{with three or four}} nice-looking gals behind the counter, and things like babies' high chairs for the {{customers}} to sit onlong in the leg and ridikerlously small in the seat. I went up to one of the gals and told Per I wanted to see Mr. Watson.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I did notice it, and I {{could not}} stand that drive. And, even if I could be got to the train, to go North, <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> a good deal at the stations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose I {{gave you}} a scare," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't mean to be so late, but those {{business}} matters took longer than I intended, {{and then there was}} a blockade of street cars and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> it. But we're all right now, I reckon," [...] he added, gazing around. [...] "Good-by to San Francisco! When we see her again may our pockets be lined with gold!" [...] And he took off his soft felt hat and waved it at the crowd on shore.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{a pretty}} black night, and the {{carriage}} drive {{up to the house}} was dark as pitch. I could hear him ahead, though I couldn't see him. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> carefully in case he might get on to it that he was being followed. I turned a curve and I was {{just in time to see}} him ring the bell and get admitted to the house. I just stopped where I was. It was beginning to rain, and I was soon pretty near soaked through. Also, it was almighty cold.|$|E
60|$|I {{bought one}} {{and found that}} he was quite correct. It did open and shut itself. I had no control over it whatever. When it began to rain, which it did that season every {{alternate}} five minutes, I used to try and get the machine to open, but it would not budge; and then I used to stand and struggle with the wretched thing, and shake it, and swear at it, while the rain poured down in torrents. Then the moment the rain ceased the absurd thing would go up suddenly with a jerk and would not come down again; and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> about under a bright blue sky, with an umbrella over my head, wishing that it would come on to rain again, so that it might not seem that I was insane.|$|E
6000|$|... "They can't take {{precedence}} {{of me in}} military functions and state ceremonies, {{but when it comes}} to civil ones and society affairs I judge they'll cuddle coolly in behind you and the knights, and Noel and <b>I</b> will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> behind themhey?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am going,--this evening. Shall I walk on, half a stage, at once, {{without any}} dinner? <b>I</b> wish you <b>had</b> heard {{the kind of}} things she said to me. You would not <b>have</b> thought that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> gone <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> with her for my own pleasure." ...|$|R
6000|$|Archie, still bewildered, as if spell-bound by his ticket, muttered, [...] "I thought <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> time <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> {{over and}} look at Strawyers." ...|$|R
60|$|To go to {{our inner}} office in Raggett Street <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> through a room in which the typists worked. They were the {{correspondence}} typists; our books and invoicing had long since overflowed into the premises we had had the luck to secure {{on either side of}} us. I was, I must confess, always in a faintly cloudily-emotional way aware of that collection of for the most part round-shouldered femininity, but presently one of the girls detached herself from the others and got a real hold upon my attention. I appreciated her at first as a straight little back, a neater back than any of the others; as a softly rounded neck with a smiling necklace of sham pearls; as chestnut hair very neatly done--and as a side-long glance; presently as a quickly turned face that looked for me.|$|E
6000|$|He {{took me to}} Blavitiski's; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> {{slowly to}} {{accommodate}} myself to his paces; and over such a lunch as I had never tasted before, he fended off my leading question, and I took a better note of his appearance. His clean-shaven face was lean and wrinkled, his shrivelled, lips fell over a set of false teeth, and his white hair was thin and rather long; he seemed small to me,--though indeed, most people seemed small to me,--and his shoulders were rounded and bent. And watching him, I {{could not help but}} observe that he too was taking note of me, running his eyes, with a curious touch of greed in them, over me, from my broad shoulders to my suntanned hands, and up to my freckled face again. [...] "And now," [...] said he, as we lit our cigarettes, [...] "I must tell you of the business in hand.|$|E
60|$|KEEGAN. Well you see I'm not a Mnooth man [he {{means that}} he was not a student at Maynooth College]. When I was young I admired the older {{generation}} of priests that had been educated in Salamanca. So when I felt sure of my vocation I went to Salamanca. Then I walked from Salamanca to Rome, an sted in a monastery there for a year. My pilgrimage to Rome taught me that walking is a better way of travelling than the train; so I walked from Rome to the Sorbonne in Paris; and I wish I could have walked from Paris to Oxford; for I was very sick on the sea. After a year of Oxford <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> to Jerusalem to walk the Oxford feeling off me. From Jerusalem I came back to Patmos, and spent six months at the monastery of Mount Athos. From that I came to Ireland and settled down as a parish priest until I went mad.|$|E
60|$|Pray can't you {{contrive}} {{to pay me}} a visit {{between this}} and Xmas? or shall I carry you down with me from Cambridge, supposing it practicable for me to come? You will do what you please, without our interfering with each other; the premises are so delightfully extensive, that two people might live together without ever seeing, hearing or meeting,--but I can't feel the comfort of this till I marry. In short {{it would be the}} most amiable matrimonial mansion, and that is another great inducement to my plan,--my wife and I shall be so happy,--one in each Wing. If this description won't make you come, I can't tell what will, you must please yourself. Good night, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> half a mile to my Bed chamber. Yours ever, BYRON.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} such a {{delightful}} rest," [...] she said, looking away from Paul and speaking to his mother. [...] "I shall never forget how good that tea tasted! But I really must go, Mrs. de Vaux! My poor animal is quite done up, and <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> all the way home." ...|$|R
60|$|My first ungrateful {{impulse was}} {{to get rid of}} the two {{cumbersome}} ladies who <b>had</b> offered <b>to</b> be my companions. It was needless to call upon my invention for an excuse; the truth, as I gladly perceived, would serve my purpose. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> only <b>to</b> tell them that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> arranged <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the farm.|$|R
