40|$|Objective – To {{document}} {{the reliability of}} the newly marketed veterinary non-invasive oscillometric blood pressure monitor: the PetTrust Handheld Blood Pressure Monitor. Study design – A prospective clinical study. Animals – Twenty-three client-owned dogs, anaesthetized for a variety of procedures. Methods – Invasive and non-invasive blood pressure measurement in the dorsal pedal artery. All measurements have been executed with and without the <b>extension</b> <b>line</b> of the PetTrust cuff. Various anesthetic protocols were used. Statistical analysis is performed by Bland-Altman difference plots. Results – The PetTrust monitor is validated according to the ACVIM recommendations, for both SAP, DAP and MAP, with and without the use of the <b>extension</b> <b>line.</b> The PetTrust monitor overestimated SAP and underestimated DAP without the <b>extension</b> <b>line.</b> When using the <b>extension</b> <b>line,</b> both SAP and DAP were overestimated.

40|$|We call {{a simple}} graph G a 4 -cycled graph if either {{it has no}} edges or every edge of it is {{contained}} in an induced 4 -cycle of G. Our interest on 4 -cycled graphs is motivated {{by the fact that}} their clique complexes {{play an important role in}} the simple-homotopy theory of simplicial complexes. We prove that the minimal simple models within the category of flag simplicial complexes are exactly the clique complexes of some 4 -cycled graphs. We further provide structural properties of 4 -cycled graphs and describe constructions yielding such graphs. We characterize 4 -cycled cographs, and 4 -cycled graphs arising from finite chessboards. We introduce a family of inductively constructed graphs, the <b>external</b> <b>extensions,</b> related to an arbitrary graph, and determine the homotopy type of the independence complexes of <b>external</b> <b>extensions</b> of some graphs.
