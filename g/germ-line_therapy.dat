However, some will probably wonder whether <b>germ-line</b> <b>therapy</b> is a debatable issue at all. While many ethicists have seized upon the tapie of <b>germ-line</b> <b>therapy</b> as a fascinating opportunity. to discuss basic ethical problems, such as our responsibility for the genetic health. offuture gener­ations, scientific opinion remains deeply divided as to its prospects as a workable therapeutic approach even in the remote future...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Recombinant DNA {{technology}} will soon allow physicians {{an opportunity to}} carry out both somatic cell- and germ-line gene therapy. While somatic cell gene therapy raises no new ethical problems, gene therapy of gametes, fertilized eggs or early embryos does raise several novel concerns. The first issue discussed here relates to making a distinction between negative and positive eugenics; the second issue deals with the evolutionary consequences of lost genetic diversity. In distinguishing between positive and negative eugenics, the concept of malady is applied as a definitional criterion for identifying genetic disorders that could qualify for <b>germ-line</b> <b>therapy.</b> Because gene replacement techniques are currently unavailable for humans, and because {{even if they were}} possible the number of people involved would be quite small, the loss of diversity concern seems moot. Finally, we dissuss the issue of iatrogenic disorders associated with gene therapy and discuss several 'real world considera-tions/ Key Words: <b>germ-line</b> <b>therapy,</b> malady, slippery slop...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the first}} steps in somatic gene therapy have already taken place, {{research}} on human <b>germ-line</b> gene <b>therapy</b> still remains taboo. However, the first protocol aiming to cure defective genes of mitochondria in germ cells has been published recently. <b>Germ-line</b> gene <b>therapy</b> is an entirely new method. Its effects and impact on future generations differ considerably from those of somatic gene therapy. A systematic and critical analysis of the arguments for and against germline gene interventions, such as "playing God" and moving on the slippery slope to enhancement will be elaborated. Special attention will {{be focused on the}} irreversible changes of the genome of future generations as well as on ethical considerations raised by different therapeutic and experimental possibilities, such as In Vitro Ovum Nuclear Transplantation (IVONT) or the creation of transgenic organisms...|$|R

This is especially so with respect to human <b>germ-line</b> gene <b>therapy.</b> Burke. K. Zimmerman makes one of the few arguments that society and the medical profession have a moral obligation to develop and use human <b>germ-line</b> gene <b>therapy.</b> However, Zimmerman's arguments are vague, and he misses some important points. It is the point of this thesis to criticize and buttress Zimmerman's arguments, and to show that philosophers have an important role to play, in conjunction with scientists, in the ethical debate surrounding genetic engineering. In addition to making suggestions for improvement of Zimmerman's argument, I will argue that the argument succeeds...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of exogenous genetic sequences named transgenes {{is known as}} gene therapy and has the purpose of correcting genotypic and phenotypic alterations in the human organism. This therapy {{can be carried out}} in somatic cells or in germinal cells. The ethical questioning related to somatic gene therapy has to do basically with the potential risks for health and the informed consent while <b>germ-line</b> gene <b>therapy</b> has the potential to affect permanently future generations. Since genic therapy involves much more than the simple alteration of genetic sequences, this revision presents the main ethical problems associated with gene therapy for inherited diseas...|$|R
40|$|With {{pre-implantation}} {{genetic diagnosis}} (PGD), genetic testing and selective transfer of embryos is possible. In the future, <b>germ-line</b> gene <b>therapy</b> (GLGT) applied to embryos before implantation, {{in order to}} introduce missing genes or replace mutant ones, may be possible. The objective of this dissertation is to analyse moral aspects of these technologies, as described by eighteen British, Italian and Swedish gynaecologists and geneticists. The objective is systematised into three parts: research interviews and qualitative analysis, philosophical analysis, and elaboration of a framework that supports the combination of analytic methods. PGD was described as positive since it enabled some couples at risk for a genetic disease {{to have a child}} without the disease. PGD was described as in different senses ‘better’ than methods for prenatal diagnosis and selective termination of pregnancy. It was also described as positive since it provided couples at risk with one more option, even if it did not result in the birth of a healthy child. However, interviewees were concerned about the difficulty of defining and evaluating genetic disease. They were also concerned about patients’ choices, and about exaggerated use or misuse. Whereas PGD gave rise to ambivalence in terms of how to understand, describe and evaluate it, GLGT was often described as unrealistic or undesirable. The results of the qualitative analysis are used in a philosophical analysis of the concepts of choice, autonomous choice, ambivalence, trust and ambivalence in trust relations. A set of distinct characteristics of each concept are elaborated. The results of the philosophical analysis are used in the discussion {{of the results of the}} qualitative analysis. The study shows that the technologies imply both ‘new’ ways to perform ‘old’ medical practices and ‘new’ practices. Old moral questions are reformulated. New moral questions are added. Against the background of this, the concept of genetic identity is discussed.

40|$|In this {{informative}} and captivating book the author presents a moral {{critique of the}} laws governing the creation of "designer babies. " Alan Gewirth's Principle of Generic Consistency is used {{as the starting point}} for developing a framework, which is then used to critique the legal position in the EU countries (with particular reference to the UK), Canada and the USA. The conclusion the author reaches is that a proper moral response to the issues covered must take account of specified prima facie presumptions, to be applied by legitimately appointed regulatory bodies. The text assesses the adequacy of existing regulatory responses by reference to these presumptions. Also containing detailed appendices summarizing the legal position with regard to abortion and prenatal diagnosis, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, in vitro embryo research, cloning, and <b>germ-line</b> gene <b>therapy</b> in the countries mentioned above, this volume is an indispensable resource for both students and scholars with a keen interest in this highly contested field...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{modification}} of cells and animals is an invaluable tool for biotechnology and biomedicine. Currently, integrating vectors {{are used for}} this purpose. These vectors, however, may lead to insertional mutagenesis and variable transgene expression and can undergo silencing. Scaffold/matrix attachment region-based vectors are nonviral expression systems that replicate autonomously in mammalian cells, thereby making possible safe and reliable genetic {{modification of}} higher eukaryotic cells and organisms. In this study, genetically modified pig fetuses were produced with the scaffold/matrix attachment region-based vector pEPI, delivered to embryos by the sperm-mediated gene transfer method. The pEPI vector was detected in 12 of 18 fetuses in the different tissues analyzed and was shown to be retained as an episome. The reporter gene encoded by the pEPI vector was expressed in 9 of 12 genetically modified fetuses. In positive animals, all tissues analyzed expressed the reporter gene; moreover in these tissues, the positive cells were on the average 79 %. The high percentage of EGFP-expressing cells {{and the absence of}} mosaicism have important implications for biotechnological and biomedical applications. These results are an important step forward in animal transgenesis and can provide the basis for the future development of <b>germ-line</b> gene <b>therapy...</b>|$|R
40|$|Technical {{developments}} {{in the last ten}} years have made possible mapping and sequencing of the entire human genome, along with the possibility of treating genetic disorders by manipulating DNA. A variety of issues regarding potential uses and abuses of these technologies have become apparent. They relate to both genetic screening and gene therapy. Problems facing individuals and their families mostly revolve around rights of self-determination and of confidentiality. Health care professionals will need to design optimal systems to provide genetic counseling, and to protect confidentiality of DNA data bases. Society and social institutions will need to develop policies and laws that protect the privacy of individuals whose DNA is stored in data banks. Patenting of the results of gene research remains controversial internationally. Moreover, there is concern in many quarters about society’s potential abuse of gene technology for eugenic purposes. Gene therapy is now a reality. There is little disagreement on the use of gene therapy to treat genetic diseases in individuals by somatic cell therapy. There is much controversy, however, over the use of <b>germ-line</b> cell <b>therapy.</b> Gene technology has contributed to the growth among a small group of influential people of the Post-Modern Movement, which is strongly antiscience and antitechnology. This movement may pose a long term threat to future technological advances, and should not be ignored. There is much outside of the laboratory that scientists, particularly molecular biologists, can do to assure a secure place for science and technology in our culture. “We wish to suggest a structure for the salt of deoxyribose nucleic acid (D. N. A.). This structure has novel features which are of considerable biological interest [...] .
