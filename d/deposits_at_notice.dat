The x {{values of the}} films <b>deposited</b> <b>at</b> RT and at 500 °C by magnetron sputtering of a graphite target in a mixed N 2 /Ar gas were 0. 6 and 0. 3, respectively. Ratios of the sp 2 - to sp 3 -hybridized components of both C and N for the film <b>deposited</b> <b>at</b> 500 °C were larger by 4 times than those for the film <b>deposited</b> <b>at</b> RT.

40|$|Tin oxide {{thin films}} were {{deposited}} on the R-cut sapphire substrate by the electron-beam evaporation of a ceramic SnO 2 source. X-ray diffraction and {{transmission electron microscopy}} studies revealed that the films <b>deposited</b> <b>at</b> lower temperatures were amorphous while those grown at temperatures above 350 °C consisted of the α-SnO phase with the PbO type structure. Epitaxial α-SnO films on the R-cut sapphire substrate were obtained when <b>deposited</b> <b>at</b> 600 °C. Atomic force microscopy studies showed that films <b>deposited</b> <b>at</b> low temperature have a smooth surface, while epitaxial SnO films <b>deposited</b> <b>at</b> high temperatures (above 600 °C) have a relatively rough surface. The atomic mobilities in the films at the various deposition temperatures and the lattice mismatch between the films and the substrates ultimately determine the microstructure and surface mophology. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis shows that the Sn/O ratios are 52. 7 / 47. 6 for the amorphous film <b>deposited</b> <b>at</b> the ambient temperature (∼ 30 °C), 48. 8 / 51. 2 for the films <b>deposited</b> <b>at</b> 350 °C, and 49. 2 / 50. 8 for the epitaxial film <b>deposited</b> <b>at</b> 600 °C.

40|$|Using dark d. c. {{electrical}} measurements, {{the electrical}} properties of LPCVD polysilicon <b>deposited</b> <b>at</b> 570 °C and 620 °C are studied. The grain boundaries {{are assumed to}} be described with disordered material and applying the Mott’s theory, the density of states near the Fermi level was determined, obtaining the values 3. 78 ⋅ 1018 cm- 3 and 1. 40 ⋅ 1018 cm- 3 for the samples <b>deposited</b> <b>at</b> low temperature and for those <b>deposited</b> <b>at</b> 620 °C, respectively.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{deposition}} temperature and in-situ post-deposition annealing on the microstructure of coevaporated Cu(InGa) Se 2 thin films {{and on the}} performance of the resulting solar cell devices have been characterized. Films were <b>deposited</b> <b>at</b> substrate temperatures of 150 °C, 300 °C and 400 °C. Films were also <b>deposited</b> <b>at</b> these temperatures and then annealed in-situ at 550 °C for 10 minutes. In as -deposited films without annealing, additional XRD reflections that may be due to a polytypic modification of the chalcopyrite phase were observed. Films <b>deposited</b> <b>at</b> 150 °C were Se-rich. Post-deposition annealing caused microstructural changes in all films and improved the resulting solar cells. Only films <b>deposited</b> <b>at</b> 400 °C, however, yielded high-efficiency devices after post-deposition annealing that were equivalent to devices made from films grown at 550 °C. Films originally <b>deposited</b> <b>at</b> 300 °C yielded devices after post-deposition annealing with VOC close to that of devices made from films grown at 550 °C, despite smaller grain size...|$|R
