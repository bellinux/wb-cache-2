40|$|The plan of {{this thesis}} is as follows. Chapt. 1 {{is devoted to}} the {{explanation}} of the main theoretical tool of our work, namely the GVM and GA. After introducing their earliest formulation by Martin C. Gutzwiller, we discuss their effectiveness in describing the physics of strongly correlated conductors, emphasizing the improvements they bring in comparison with mean-field, independent-electron approximations such as HF, and their limitations with respect to more refined, though computationally more costly, methods like DMFT and VQMC. We mention how the GA was initially exploited as an approximate tool for analytical calculation of expectation values on the GVW, and how later studies proved its exactness in the limit of infinite lattice coordination. After that, we discuss its more recent multi-band formulation which, together with the mixed-basis parametrization of Gutzwiller parameter matrix, is particularly important for combining the GVM with DFT. In Chapt. 2 we present our results for the strongly correlated Hubbard lattice with broken translational invariance due to the presence of a surface (panel (a) in Fig. 1), a metal-metal or metal-insulator <b>junction</b> (<b>panel</b> (b)), or a “sandwich” of Mott insulator or strongly correlated metal between metallic leads (panel (c)). For all geometries, we show the layer dependence of the quasi-particle weight and provide approximate analytical fits for the data, together with a comparison with DMFT calculations on similar systems. In Chapt. 3, we introduce the formalism of DFT, the Kohn-Sham self-consistent equations for the functional minimization and the LDA for exchange and correlation functionals. We further discuss the performance and limitations of LDA and present the LDA+U method as a way to correct the self-interaction error of LDA. We explain the details of the GDF in Chapt. 4, and underline its similarities and differences with respect to the LDA+U functional. In the same chapter we present our data for paramagnetic and ferromagnetic bcc iron obtained through our implementation of LDA+G in the Siesta code. We show energy differences between spin-polarized and unpolarized Iron computed within LDA, GGA and LDA+G and with different basis sets. We compare the band structure, lattice parameters and magnetic moments (some sample data is shown in Table 1) obtained with these functionals, and discuss the implications of our results on the understanding of the origin of magnetism in transition metals. In the appendices we list some important results that we believed too detailed or too marginal to be presented in {{the main body of the}} thesis. Appendix A is devoted to some proofs and detailed explanations related to the GVM. In Appendix B we include all details related to the calculations on the layered geometries of Chapt. 2. In Appendix C we explain how to implement spin and orbital symmetries in the parametrization of the Gutzwiller projector, while in Appendix D we give the details of the minimization algorithm we implemented for optimizing the variational energy of the LDA+G calculation with respect to Gutzwiller parameters. Finally, Appendix E contains various topics of DFT and LDA+U that are important for the understanding of the GDF we implemented and discussed in Chapt. 4...|$|E

40|$|A {{theory is}} {{described}} for propagation of vortical waves across alternate rigid and compliant panels. The {{structure in the}} fluid side at the <b>junction</b> of <b>panels</b> is a highly vortical narrow viscous structure which is idealized as a wave driver.

The economics of these devices will also become more favorable as production volume increases, and integration within the solar <b>panel?s</b> <b>junction</b> box reduces part count and installation time.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has undertaken a multi-year project to compare the measured performance of BIPV panels to the predictions of photovoltaic simulation tools. The existing simulation models require input parameters that characterize the electrical performance of BIPV panels subjected to various meteorological conditions.

Each one is characterized by dramatic changes in both gene expression and cellular architecture. During differentiation, mononucleated myoblasts fuse to form multinucleated myotubes; subcellular organelles, such as the Golgi complex, are reorganized (Tassin et al., 1985 a,b), and new membrane systems, such as the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the T-tubule system, are assembled (Flucher et al., 199 D.

40|$|In {{this paper}} an active damping method using blended {{velocity}} feedback for {{the reduction of}} sound transmission through a simplified aircraft double panel is considered. The double panel consists of a source and a radiating panel, which are coupled acoustically by {{the air in the}} cavity between them and structurally by four elastic mounts. The double panel is equipped with an array of nine voice-coil actuators that can react against the two panels. A velocity sensor is mounted at both <b>panel</b> <b>junctions</b> of each actuator. The outputs from the sensors on the source and radiating panels are weighted by factors α and 1 - α, respectively. The two weighted signals are then subtracted and combined into the error signal fed back to the actuator via a constant amplification gain.

3000|$|The CubeSat {{standard}} mass {{limit is}} 4  kg for a 3 U. We can include a 6 % mass margin and remain below this value. However this requirement can be relaxed to 5  kg {{depending on the}} launch provider [66]. This is useful if an operational lifetime of more than 6 months is desired which necessitates heavier shielding of the APDs (not included in the current SWaP). The type of solar panels [39] and the orbit of the CubeSat (see Sect.  4.3) limit the total power production per orbit to 21  Wh. We consume only 83 % of this value. The satellite is within line {{of sight of the}} OGS for a maximum of 11  min (if it passes with 0 ° inclination), of which at most 220  s can be used for key generation. Thus most subsystems only operate for a fraction of each orbit. Together these consume 17.4  Wh 11 while the always-on systems (attitude control, UHF-band communications, GPS and main computer) consume a further 13.5  Wh per orbit. The CubeSat’s single-photon detector system must operate only at night to avoid excessive background counts. Therefore a large set of batteries are necessary. To preserve battery life and provide a safety margin we assumed that the batteries are never drained by more than 30 % [...]. Thus we require a total battery capacity of at least 58  Wh. Our design provides for 60  Wh [67]. The CubeSat consumes a total of 17.4  Wh per orbit while its solar panels can produce a maximum of 21  Wh. The typical performance of this class of triple <b>junction</b> solar <b>panels</b> degrades to ≈ 85 % of the above beginning of life value over 10 to 15 years [68, 69]. Thus with our short 1 to 2 year mission lifetime we can safely ignore this degradation. This means that the CubeSat is capable of one Q.Com connection per orbit. Larger satellites would be needed for continuous operation of the Q.Com link with more than one OGS per orbit, however this drastically increases the cost.|$|R
30|$|In this work, {{we studied}} the thermal {{behavior}} and addressed {{the challenges of}} life testing of large area OLED devices. In particular, we developed an indirect method to accurately calculate the life time of large-area OLED lighting panels without physically life-testing the panels. Using small area OLEDs with structures identical with the tested panels, we performed the life tests at desired driving current densities at different temperatures and extracted the relationship between junction temperature and the lifetime for the particular device. By measuring the <b>panel</b> <b>junction</b> temperature during operation under the same current density and using the life time measured on small area test devices, we determine the lifetime of the panels based on the thermal dependence. We test this methodology by predicting the life time of white PHOLED panels and then physically testing the panels. The typical result for the lifetime to 80 % of the initial luminance (LT 80) of the panel at a constant dc current density of 10  mA/cm 2 (3800  cd/m 2), was predicted to be 526  hours in good agreement with the actual life-test at 10  mA/cm 2 of 512  hrs. This good agreement, confirmed in different experiments, validates this novel technique as a practical life time predictor of large-area OLED lighting panels in a time saving manner.|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α plus interferon (IFN) -γ {{has been shown}} previously to promote redistribution of platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1 (PECAM- 1) (CD 31), junctional adhesion molecule (JAM), and VE-cadherin away from lateral junctions of human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers. In parallel, neutrophil transmigration was significantly reduced. Because PECAM- 1 and JAM have been implicated in leukocyte transmigration, the observed redistribution by cytokine activation was presumed to represent the mechanism causing decreased transmigration under static conditions. The current results confirm that culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with TNF-α plus IFN-γ caused a decrease in surface-expressed and junctional-localized JAM and PECAM- 1, but did not cause decreased leukocyte transmigration in an in vitro flow assay. Furthermore, blocking monoclonal antibody to PECAM- 1 still significantly reduced monocyte transmigration, demonstrating that it retains a functional role even though its levels were reduced and redistributed away from <b>junctions,</b> whereas a <b>panel</b> of monoclonal antibodies to JAM failed to reduce leukocyte transmigration. Given the alterations in junction protein location, permeability function was assessed. IFN-γ alone or TNF-α plus IFN-γ significantly increased permeability, but TNF-α alone did not, suggesting lack of correlation between transmigration and loss of permeability. In conclusion, cytokine activation induced loss and redistribution of PECAM- 1 and JAM away from lateral junctions, but per se does not negatively regulate either neutrophil or monocyte transmigration under flow...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we seek to}} develop smaller, less expensive, and more {{efficient}} power electronics. We also investigate emerging applications where the proper implementation of these new types of power converters can {{have a significant impact}} on the overall system performance. We have developed a new two-stage dc-dc converter architecture suitable for low-voltage CMOS power delivery. The architecture, which combines the benefits of switched-capacitor and inductor-based converters, achieves both large voltage step-down and high switching frequency, while maintaining good efficiency. We explore the benefits of a new soft-charging technique that drastically reduces the major loss mechanism in switched-capacitor converters, and we show experimental results from a 5 -to- 1 V, 0. 8 W integrated dc-dc converter developed in 180 nm CMOS technology. The use of power electronics to increase system performance in a portable thermophotovoltaic power generator is also investigated in this thesis. We show that mechanical non-idealities in a MEMS fabricated energy conversion device can be mitigated with the help of low-voltage distributed maximum power point tracking (MPPT) dc-dc converters. As part of this work, we explore low power control and sensing architectures, and present experimental results of a 300 mW integrated MPPT developed in 0. 35 um CMOS with all power, sensing and control circuitry on chip. The final piece of this thesis investigates the implementation of distributed power electronics in solar photovoltaic applications. We explore the benefits of small, intelligent power converters integrated directly into the solar <b>panel</b> <b>junction</b> box to enhance overall energy capture in real-world scenarios. To this end, we developed a low-cost, high efficiency (> 98 %) power converter that enables intelligent control and energy conversion at the sub-panel level.
