40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} the prevalence and limiting factors ofbreastfeeding {{in the first}} hour of life at the Maternity Center of HospitalIsraelita Albert Einstein, where the predominant model of childbirthcare is largely based {{on the use of}} modern technology. Methods: Aretrospective study with quantitative analysis in a middle and upperclass population of different cultural backgrounds. Data were obtainedfrom the <b>delivery</b> <b>record</b> <b>book</b> in a total of 12, 350 births from January 2004 to December 2007. Results: Of 12, 350 births, 3, 277 (26. 9 %) were excluded because of contraindications to breastfeeding in thefirst hour of life such as: prematurity, respiratory distress, adverseeffects of anesthesia, obstetric conditions, congenital malformation,and others. Other 180 cases were excluded due to missing data. Of the remaining 8, 893 cases, 2, 279 (18. 7 %) were not breastfedbecause of limiting factors that require improvement actions: highdelivery turnover, patient refusal, medical refusal, tiredness due toprolonged labor, loss of data recording. Cesarean delivery and the useof anesthesia did neither prevent breastfeeding in the first hour of lifenor skin-to-skin contact. The prevalence was 74. 3 %. Conclusions:The use of technology and the hospital practices interfere inbreastfeeding, but are not factors that prevent it. The identificationof the prevalence and limiting factors contributes to the evaluationof the care provided and elaboration of nursing interventions forcontinuous improvement of the care practice. Improvement actionsshould include prenatal care and delivery itself...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the process of}} institutionalization of child delivery practices in Malaysia for the last fifty years. The main data analyzed are the "Delivery Record Books" of 1957 through 2000 which are found at the Kajang Hospital located approximately 26 km southeast of Kuala Lumpur. A historical {{analysis of the data}} indicates considerable differences in delivery practices between three major ethnic groups in Malaysia; in the earlier period Chinese and Indian women were predominant in the <b>Delivery</b> <b>Record</b> <b>Books,</b> while Malay women, evidently preferring to give birth at home with the assistance of bidan kampung (traditional midwives), were scarcely represented. These findings imply that Chinese and Indians, many of who had immigrated to Malaya as laborers, had greater access to modern medical care under the maternal and child health policy of the British colonial government because the reproduction of laborers was given high priority during the colonial period. It was only after the 1960 s that medical projects such as the construction of midwife clinics were brought into rural areas where the majority of Malays lived. In these clinics, the government midwives started to assist Malay women in their deliveries and advise them to deliver at the nearby hospital if any complications were expected. The government also imposed strict rules to prohibit bidan kampung from providing child delivery services. Hence, the number of Malays in the rural areas who gave birth at the Kajang Hospital increased dramatically in the 1960 s, especially after the 1970 s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Many European {{countries}} including Ireland lack high quality, on-going, population based {{estimates of}} maternal behaviours and experiences during pregnancy. PRAMS is a CDC surveillance program {{which was established}} in the United States in 1987 to generate high quality, population based data to reduce infant mortality rates and improve maternal and infant health. PRAMS is the only on-going population based surveillance system of maternal behaviours and experiences that occur before, during and after pregnancy worldwide. 				 				 					 						Methods 					The objective {{of this study was to}} adapt, test and evaluate a modified CDC PRAMS methodology in Ireland. The birth certificate file which is the standard approach to sampling for PRAMS in the United States was not available for the PRAMS Ireland study. Consequently, <b>delivery</b> <b>record</b> <b>books</b> for the period between 3 and 5 months before the study start date at a large urban obstetric hospital [8, 900 births per year] were used to randomly sample 124 women. Name, address, maternal age, infant sex, gestational age at delivery, delivery method, APGAR score and birth weight were manually extracted from records. Stillbirths and early neonatal deaths were excluded using APGAR scores and hospital records. Women were sent a letter of invitation to participate including option to opt out, followed by a modified PRAMS survey, a reminder letter and a final survey. 				 				 					 						Results 					The response rate for the pilot was 67 %. Two per cent of women refused the survey, 7 % opted out of the study and 24 % did not respond. Survey items were at least 88 % complete for all 82 respondents. Prevalence estimates of socially undesirable behaviours such as alcohol consumption during pregnancy were high [> 50 %] and comparable with international estimates. 				 				 					 						Conclusion 					PRAMS is a feasible and valid method of collecting information on maternal experiences and behaviours during pregnancy in Ireland.

40|$|Objective: Poor {{medical record}} {{documentation}} remains a pervasive problem in hospital delivery rooms, hampering efforts {{aimed at improving}} the quality of maternal and neonatal care in resource-limited settings. We evaluated the feasibility and completeness of labor room documentation within a quasi-experimental study aimed at improving emergency preparedness for obstetric and neonatal emergencies in 8 nonteaching, subdistrict, secondary care hospitals of Karnataka state, India. Methods: We redesigned the existing open-ended case sheet into a structured, <b>delivery</b> <b>record</b> cum job aide adhering to principles of local clinical relevance, parsimony, and computerizability. Skills and emergency drills training along with supportive supervision were introduced in 4 “intervention arm” hospitals while the new <b>delivery</b> <b>records</b> were used in eight intervention and control hospitals. Results: Introduction of the new <b>delivery</b> <b>record</b> was feasible over a “run-in” period of 4 months. About 92 % (6103 of 6634) of women in intervention facilities and 80 % (6205 of 7756) in control facilities had their <b>delivery</b> <b>records</b> filled in during the 1 -year study period. Completeness of <b>delivery</b> <b>record</b> documentation fell into one of two subsets with one set of parameters being documented with minimal inputs (in both intervention and control sites) and another set of parameters requiring more intensive training efforts (and seen more in intervention than in control sites; P <. 05).

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE—To {{identify}} variables {{available in}} early Swedish <b>delivery</b> <b>records</b> and {{their relation to}} birth outcomes for home and hospital deliveries in Gothenburg at {{the early part of}} this century.  DESIGN—A retrospective recovery of original <b>delivery</b> <b>records</b> and social variables in a cross sectional population.  SETTING—Gothenburg, Sweden.  PARTICIPANTS— 851 fullterm singleton female births with known gestational age born into five birth cohorts on selected dates (1908,  1914,  1918,  1922  and 1930).  MAIN RESULTS—Delivery site, maternal parity, gestational age, and social group were significant factors influencing birth outcome as birth weight and length. The mean birth weight and length of hospital born infants was consistently lower than for home deliveries across all cohorts. Site of delivery changed significantly during the period of births under study, 1908 - 1930.  CONCLUSIONS—In this study, which was based on original <b>delivery</b> <b>records</b> from {{the early part of this}} century, it was found that delivery site was an important factor influencing birth outcome across five birth cohorts. Utilisation of delivery services changed during the period of study. Thus, to avoid selection bias, the application of <b>delivery</b> <b>records</b> should reflect the birthing practice of the time period in question.    Keywords: sociodemographic; birth weight; birth length; delivery sit...|$|R

We hypothesised that patients who demonstrated evidence of self-testing by bringing a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> (capillary blood glucose monitoring diary) to clinic would have better glycaemic control than patients with a glucometer alone, or neither <b>record</b> <b>book</b> nor glucometer. Methods: This was a prospective observational study of 233 consecutive type 1 diabetes patients using basal-bolus insulin. Exclusion criteria were diagnosis of type 1 diabetes within the previous year, current pregnancy, or prior inclusion in this study. We recorded {{the presence or absence}} of a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> or glucometer at the clinic, glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c), and previous structured education attendance. Results: Of 233 patients, 90 brought a <b>record</b> <b>book,</b> 61 brought a glucometer and 82 brought neither. Mean HbA 1 c did not differ between patients with a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> (63 ± 2 mmol/mol [7. 9 ± 0. 2 %]) or glucometer (63 ± 2 mmol/mol [7. 9 ± 0. 2 %]), but was higher in those with neither (77 ± 2 mmol/mol [9. 2 ± 0. 2 %]; p< 0. 001). Patients bringing a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> were older on average than those with a glucometer or neither (49. 6 ± 1. 7 vs. 41. 2 ± 1. 7 vs. 40. 6 ± 1. 4 years; p< 0. 001) and had longer mean duration of diabetes (27. 9 ± 2. 0 vs. 19. 2 ± 1. 7 vs. 18. 7 ± 1. 6 years; p< 0. 001). Prior structured education did not predict the presence of a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> or glucometer in the clinic. Conclusions: Evidence of self-testing at clinic review, either as a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> or glucometer, was associated with improved control compared with those with neither.
