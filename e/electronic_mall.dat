40|$|Abstract. Electronic catalogs (or e-catalogs), {{like their}} printed counter-parts, hold {{information}} about {{the goods and services}} offered or requested by the market participants and, consequently, form the basis of the in-formation phase of electronic commerce. As <b>electronic</b> <b>malls</b> as well as e-catalogs made by each of them rapidly increase in number, there are some emerging problems in dealing with e-catalogs such as the catalog heterogeneity and the redundant investment in the making of catalogs. In this paper, to achieve catalog interoperability and catalog sharing, we propose an extended catalog model of e-catalogs and present a view-integrated architecture for an electronic catalog library, named Cata-logStop. The Live Catalog in CatalogStop is a virtual catalog that can be bound directly to the contents in the catalog repository or to a query that will retrieve the contents from possibly distributed and heteroge-neous catalog sources using a standard protocol. ...|$|R

40|$|Web mining {{is the use}} of {{data mining}} {{techniques}} to automatically discover and extract information from World Wide Web documents and services (e. g., on-line travel agents, job listings, <b>electronic</b> <b>malls,</b> etc.). This article considers the question: is effective Web mining possible? Skeptics believe that the Web is too unstructured for Web mining to succeed. Indeed, data mining has been applied to databases traditionally, yet much of the information on the Web lies buried in documents designed for human consumption such as home pages or product catalogs. Furthermore, much of the information on the Web is presented in natural language text with no machine-readable semantics; HTML annotations structure the display of Web pages, but provide little insight into their content. Some have advocated transforming the Web into a massive layered database to facilitate data mining[12], but the Web is too dynamic and chaotic to be tamed in this manner. Others have attempted to hand code site-specific &quot;wrappers &quot; that facilitate the extraction of information from individual Web resources (e. g., [8]). Hand coding is convenient but cannot keep up with the explosive growth of the Web. As an alternative, this article argues for the: Structured Web Hypothesis: Information on the Web is sufficiently structured to facilitate effective Web mining. Examples of Web structure include linguistic and typographic conventions, HTML annotations {e. g.,<title», classes ofsemi-structured documents {e. g., product catalogs), Web indices and directories, and much more. To support the Structured Web Hypothesis, this article will survey preliminary Web mining successes and suggest directions for future work. Web mining may be decomposed into the following subtasks: 1 1. Resource Discovery: locating unfamiliar documents and services on the Web. 2. Information Extraction: automatically extracting specific information from newly discovered Web resources. 3.

40|$|We {{refer to}} the sale of goods and {{services}} to end consumers (i. e. a mass of clients with small quantity requirements) as retail markets. These normally include private clients, households and small businesses. Therefore, the cost of transactions in retail markets tends to be rather high compared to those encountered with institutional clients. Building upon the potential that electronic markets have on the reduction of those costs, this article presents the concept of the <b>electronic</b> <b>mall.</b> The economic system has created a number of institutions which should, from the transaction cost point of view, assure the most advantageous distribution of by Prof. Dr. Beat F. Schmid University of St. Gallen goods to the retail client. These forms of distribution are fundamentally correlated with the means of transport and communication chosen. In former times, retail markets for food and items of everyday life were based on several levels of distribution, leading from the producer to the wholesale dealer to a number of retail dealers and finally to the client. Nowadays, the development of efficient transportation services and information systems along with modern warehouses have reduced the number of mediators to a single one: producer-warehouse-client. This development is further fueled by modern means of telecommunication. For example, virtual warehouses, as found on the Internet, are offering delivery directly from the producer to the retail client. This will be expanded upon later on. Other domains, such as banking, still cling to a highly vertical integration. They provide their banking services and distribute them themselves, or as in retail banking, through their branches. At the bottom end of the value chain, however, we find a new situation. Important products are increasingly being purchased from external entities (e. g. financial information- from such information brokers as Reuters, Dow Jones, Knight Ridder, etc. - electronic exchanges and clearing institutions) as opposed to being produced internally.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} dilemma confronts retailers with stand-alone {{sites on}} the World Wide Web and those attempting to build <b>electronic</b> <b>malls</b> for delivery via the Internet, online services, or interactive television (Alba et al. 1997). For consumers, the main potential advantage of electronic shopping over other channels is a reduction in search costs for products and product-related information. Retailers, however, fear that such lowering of consumers' search costs will intensify competition and lower margins by expanding the scope of competition from local to national and international. Some retailers' electronic offerings have been constructed to thwart comparison shopping and to ward off price competition, dimming the appeal of many initial electronic shopping services. Ceteris paribus, if electronic shopping lowers the cost of acquiring price information, it should increase price sensitivity, just {{as is the case}} for price advertising. In a similar vein, though, electronic shopping can lower the cost of search for quality information. Most analyses ignore the offsetting potential of the latter effect to lower price sensitivity in the current period. They also ignore the potential of maximally transparent shopping systems to produce welfare gains that give consumers a long-term reason to give repeat business to electronic merchants (cf. Alba et al. 1997, Bakos 1997). We test conditions under which lowered search costs should increase or decrease price sensitivity. We conducted an experiment in which we varied independently three different search costs via electronic shopping: search cost for price information, search cost for quality information within a given store, and search cost for comparing across two competing electronic wine stores. Consumers spent their own money purchasing wines from two competing electronic merchants selling some overlapping and some unique wines. We show four primary empirical results. First, for differentiated products like wines, lowering the cost of search for quality information reduced price sensitivity. Second, price sensitivity for wines common to both stores increased when cross-store comparison was made easy, as many analysts have assumed. However, easy cross-store comparison had no effect on price sensitivity for unique wines. Third, making information environments more transparent by lowering all three search costs produced welfare gains for consumers. They liked the shopping experience more, selected wines they liked more in subsequent tasting, and their retention probability was higher when they were contacted two months later and invited to continue using the electronic shopping service from home. Fourth, we examined the implications of these results for manufacturers and examined how market shares of wines sold by two stores or one were affected by search costs. When store comparison was difficult, results showed that the market share of common wines was proportional to share of distribution; but when store comparison was made easy, the market share returns to distribution decreased signi. cantly. All these results suggest incentives for retailers carrying differentiated goods to make information environments maximally transparent, but to avoid price competition by carrying more unique merchandise.

40|$|Bargaining is {{becoming}} increasingly important due to developments {{within the field of}} electronic commerce, especially the development of autonomous software agents. Software agents are programs which, given instructions from a user, are capable of autonomously and intelligently realise a given task. By means of such agents, the bargaining process can be automated, allowing products and services together with related conditions, such as warranty and delivery time, to be flexible and tuned to the individual preferences of the people concerned. In this theses we concentrate on both fundamental aspects of bargaining as well as business-related applications of automated bargaining using software agents. The fundamental part investigates bargaining outcomes within a stylised world, and the factors that influence these outcomes. This can provide insights for the production of software agents, strategies, and setting up bargaining rules for practical situations. We study these aspects using computational simulations of bargaining agents. Hereby we consider adaptive systems, i. e., where agents learn to adjust their bargaining strategy given past experience. This learning behaviour is simulated using evolutionary algorithms. These algorithms originate from the field of artificial intelligence, and are inspired by the biological theory of evolution. Originally, evolutionary algorithms were designed for solving optimisation problems, but they are now increasingly being used within economics for modelling human learning behaviour. Besides computational simulations, we also consider mathematical solutions from game theory for relatively simple cases. Game theory is mainly concerned with the “rational man”, that is, with optimal outcomes within an stylised setting (or game) where people act rationally. We use the game-theoretic outcomes to validate the computational experiments. The advantage of computer simulations is that less strict assumptions are necessary, and that more complex interactions that are closer to real-world settings can be investigated. First of all, we study a bargaining setting where two players exchange offers and counter offers, the so-called alternating-offers game. This game is frequently used for modelling bargaining about for instance the price of a product or service. It is also important, however, to allow other product- and service-related aspects to be negotiated, such as quality, delivery time, and warranty. This enables compromises by conceding on less important issues and demanding a higher value for relatively important aspects. This way, bargaining is less competitive and the resulting outcome can be mutually beneficial. Therefore, we investigate using computational simulations an extended version of the alternating-offers game, where multiple aspects are negotiated concurrently. Moreover, we apply game theory to validate the results of the computational experiments. The simulation shows that learning agents are capable of quickly finding optimal compromises, also called Pareto-efficient outcomes. In addition, we study the effects of time pressure that arise if negotiations are broken off with a small probability, for example due to external eventualities. In absence of time pressure and a maximum number of negotiation rounds, outcomes are very unbalanced: the player that has the opportunity to make a final offer proposes a take-it-or-leave-it offer in the last round, which leaves the other player with a deal that is only slightly better than no deal at all. With relatively high time pressure, on the other hand, the first offer is most important and almost all agreements are reached in the first round. Another interesting result is that the simulation outcomes after a long period of learning in general coincide with the results from game theory, {{in spite of the fact}} that the learning agents are not “rational”. In reality, not only the final outcome is important, but also other factors play a role, such as the fairness of an offer. Using the simulation we study the influence of such fairness norms on the bargaining outcomes. The fairness norms result in much more balanced outcomes, even with no time pressure, and seem to be closer outcomes in the real world. Negotiations are rarely isolated, but can also be influenced by external factors such as additional bargaining opportunities. We therefore also consider bargaining within a market-like setting, where both buyers and sellers can bargain with several opponents before reaching an agreement. The negotiations are executed consecutively until an agreement is reached or no more opportunities are available. Each bargaining game is reduced to a single round, where player 1 makes an offer and player 2 can only respond by rejecting or accepting this offer. Using an evolutionary simulation we study several properties of this market game. It appears that the outcomes depend on the information that is available to the players. If players are informed about the bargaining opportunities of their opponents, the first player in turn has the advantage and always proposes a take-it-or-leave-it deal that leaves the other player with a relatively poor outcome. This outcome is consistent with a game-theoretic analysis which we also present in this thesis. If this information is not available, a theoretical analysis is very hard. The evolutionary simulation, however, shows that in this case the responder obtains a better deal. This occurs because the first player can no longer anticipate the response of the other player, and therefore bids lower to avoid a disagreement. In this thesis, we additionally consider other factors that influence the outcomes of the market game, such as negotiation over multiple issues simultaneously, search costs, and break off probabilities. Besides fundamental issues, this thesis presents a number of business-related applications of automated bargaining, as well as generic bargaining strategies for agents that can be employed in related areas. As a first application, we introduce a framework where negotiation is used for recommending shops to customers, for example on a web page of an <b>electronic</b> shopping <b>mall.</b> Through a market-driven auction a relevant selection of shops is determined in a distributed fashion. This is achieved by selling a limited number of banner spaces in an electronic auction. For each arriving customer on the web page, shops can automatically place bids for this “customer attention space” through their shop agents. These software agents bid based on a customer profile, containing personal data of the customer, such as age, interests, and/or keywords in a search query. The shop agents are adaptive and learn, given feedback from the customers, which profiles to target and how much to bid in the auction. The highest bidders are then selected and displayed to the customer. The feasibility of this distributed approach for matching shops to customers is demonstrated using an evolutionary simulation. Several customer models and auction mechanisms are studied, and we show that the market-based approach results in a proper selection of shops for the customers. Bargaining can be especially beneficial if not only the price, but other aspects are considered as well. This allows for example to customise products and services to the personal preferences of a user. We developed a system makes use of these properties for selling and personalising so-called information goods, such as news articles, software, and music. Using the alternating-offers protocol, a seller agent negotiates with several buyers simultaneously about a fixed price, a per-item price, and the quality of a bundle of information goods. The system is capable of taking into account important business-related conditions such as the fairness of the negotiation. The agents combine a search strategy and a concession strategy to generate offers in the negotiations. The concession strategy determines the amount the agent will concede each round, whereas the search strategy takes care of the personalisation of the offer. We introduce two search strategies in this thesis, and show through computer experiments that the use of these strategies by a buyer and seller agent, result in personalised outcomes, also when combined with various concession strategies. The search strategies presented here can be easily applied to other domains where personalisation is important. In addition, we also developed concession strategies for the seller agent that can be used in settings where a single seller agent bargains with several buyer agents simultaneously. Even if bargaining itself is bilateral (i. e., between two parties), a seller agent can actually benefit from the fact that several such negotiations occur concurrently. The developed strategies are focussed on domains where supply is flexible and can be adjusted to meet demand, like for information goods. We study fixed strategies, time-dependent strategies and introduce several auction-inspired strategies. Auctions are often used when one party negotiates with several opponents simultaneously. Although the latter strategies benefit from the advantages of auctions, the actual negotiation remains bilateral and consists of exchanging offers and counter offers. We developed an evolutionary simulation environment to evaluate the seller agent’s strategies. We especially consider the case where buyers are time-impatient and under pressure to reach agreements early. The simulations show that the auction-inspired strategies are able to obtain almost maximum profits from the negotiations, given sufficient time pressure of the buyers...|$|R
