40|$|Background: Shift work {{research}} has shown that the relationship between exposure to irregular working times and sickness absence may differ between working populations. Not much is known about the prevalence of sickness absence in flight crews or about the relationship between exposure to different flight schedules and sickness absence in this population. Aims: To examine the association between cumulative exposure to different <b>flight</b> <b>types</b> and sickness absence in flight crew members. Methods: The study population consisted of flight crew members from a 5 year historic cohort. Flight schedule and sickness absence data were obtained from company records. The association between the cumulative exposure to different <b>flight</b> <b>types</b> and sickness absence episodes of > 7 days was determined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Adjusted models were obtained by adding potential confounders. Previous sickness absence was added to compose the fully adjusted models. Results: The records of 8228 employees were analysed. The fully adjusted univariate analyses showed that the numbers of medium-haul flights and flights with time zone crossings were associated with an increase in the odds for sickness absence. The fully adjusted multivariate analyses showed no significant associations between <b>flight</b> <b>types</b> and sickness absence. Conclusions: Cumulative exposure to <b>flight</b> <b>types</b> was not independently associated with sickness absence in flight crew members when previous sickness absence was taken into account. Because sickness absence in the past can predict future absence, preventive strategies targeted at flight crew members with a history of high sickness absence may be effective...|$|R

We wondered about alteration of <b>flight</b> <b>types</b> spread borderline as a function of global climate change. Catching data were evaluated by simple mathematical proportional numbers. Catching results originating from different points of the country were compared with Walter-Lieth climate diagram (2004) and Péczely’s Hungarian climate districts. Latter was to reveal correlations of <b>flight</b> <b>types</b> and different climatic districts. The previously published flight alteration tendency of ECB (Keszthelyi 2003, 2004 b) continued in 2004. Generation quotients proved this process too. Average generation quotient of populations in South-eastern Hungary was 6, and the top of the same rate in this district was 10, 84. The earlier observed „one peak flight” type was replaced by „two peaks flight” type in North-western Hungary (average generation quotient of this district: 2, 5). The 1 RIN (relative individual number per one day) shows regressive tendency from South-eastern Hungary to North-western Hungary (1 RIN of 1. district: 6, 99; 1 RIN of 4. district: 4, 69; 1 RIN of 10. district: 2, 78), but unequivocal conclusions cannot be drawn from these values for places of ecotypes.

40|$|Background: Accelerometry {{has been}} used to {{identify}} behaviours through the quantification of body posture and motion for a range of species moving in different media. This technique has not been applied to flight behaviours to the same degree, having only been used to distinguish flapping from soaring flight, even though identifying the <b>type</b> of soaring <b>flight</b> could provide important insights into the factors underlying movement paths in soaring birds. This {{may be due to the}} complexities of interpreting acceleration data, as movement in the aerial environment may be influenced by phenomena such as centripetal acceleration (pulling-g). This study used high-resolution movement data on the flight of free-living Andean condors (Vultur gryphus) and a captive Eurasian griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) to examine the influence of gravitational, dynamic and centripetal acceleration in different <b>flight</b> <b>types.</b> <b>Flight</b> behaviour was categorised as thermal soaring, slope soaring, gliding and flapping, using changes in altitude and heading from magnetometry data. We examined the ability of the k-nearest neighbour (KNN) algorithm to distinguish between these behaviours using acceleration data alone. 							Results: Values of the vectorial static body acceleration (VeSBA) suggest that these birds experience relatively little centripetal acceleration in flight, though this varies between <b>flight</b> <b>types.</b> Centripetal acceleration appears to be of most influence during thermal soaring; consequently, it is not possible to derive bank angle from smoothed values of lateral acceleration. In contrast, the smoothed acceleration values in the dorso-ventral axis provide insight into body pitch, which varied linearly with airspeed. Classification of passive <b>flight</b> <b>types</b> via KNN was limited, with low accuracy and precision for soaring and gliding. 							Conclusion: The importance of soaring was evident in the high proportion of time each bird spent in this flight mode (52. 17 – 84. 00 %). Accelerometry alone was limited in its ability to distinguish between passive <b>flight</b> <b>types,</b> though smoothed values in the dorso-ventral axis did vary with airspeed. Other sensors, in particular the magnetometer, provided powerful methods of identifying flight behaviour and these data may be better suited for automated behavioural identification. This should provide further insight into the type and strength of updraughts available to soaring birds. Fil: Williams, H. J [...] Swansea University; Reino UnidoFil: Shepard, E. L.

40|$|Abstract — Dynamic sensor network(DSN) {{technology}} {{which is}} based on swarming <b>flight</b> <b>type</b> air node offers analyzed and acquired information on target data gathered by air nodes in rotation flight or 3 dimension array flight. Efficient operation of dynamic sensor network based on air node is possible when problems of processing time, data transmission reliability, power consumption and intermittent connectivity are solved. Delay tolerant network (DTN) can be a desirable alternative to solve those problems. DTN using store-and-forward message switching technology is a solution to intermittent network connectivity, long and variable delay time, asymmetric data rates, and high error rates. However, all processes are performed at the bundle layer, so high power consumption, long processing time, and repeated reliability technique occur. DSN based on swarming <b>flight</b> <b>type</b> air node need to adopt store-and-forward message switching technique of DTN, the cancelation scheme of repeated reliability technique, fast processing time with simplified layer composition...|$|E
