5|$|In 2009, fashion {{designer}} Dawn Simorangkir brought a libel suit against Love concerning a <b>defamatory</b> post Love made on her Twitter account, which was settled for $450,000. Six years later, Simorangkir filed another lawsuit against Love for further <b>defamatory</b> Twitter posts, and Love paid a further $350,000 in recompense. A similar suit was brought against Love by her former attorney Rhonda Holmes in 2014, who also accused Love of online defamation, seeking $8 million in damages. It {{was the first}} case of alleged Twitter-based libel in U.S. history {{to make it to}} trial. The jury, however, found in Love's favor.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Lambesis {{said that}} {{although}} they were marketed as a Christian band, the members privately considered themselves atheists. Former guitarist Nick Hipa calls these claims slanderous and <b>defamatory.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because {{no money}} is {{exchanged}} and laws are rarely broken, {{there is little}} legal recourse to take upon discovery of someone faking illness. However, a participant in a 7,000-member online support group brought a lawsuit against a website for <b>defamatory</b> language in 2005. The lawsuit followed heated discussion on the website about his dire predicaments and related crises, which seemed to contradict medical knowledge and his own accounts. The lawsuit was withdrawn after the presiding judge intended to allow cross-examination of the plaintiff's medical history.|$|E
5|$|Beck filed a {{complaint}} to the WIPO under the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP), arguing the domain name of the website was <b>defamatory</b> and asserted trademark infringement in its use of his name. Eiland-Hall filed a response brief to WIPO which cited the U.S. Supreme Court case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, asserting the website's domain name {{was a form of}} free speech and satirical political humor.|$|E
5|$|Episode 232 of the anime series had a <b>defamatory</b> {{depiction}} of a character that referenced a specific politician, the current Minister for Government Revitalisation Renhō Murata, {{which resulted in the}} cancellation of its rerun on AT-X. Series supervisor Shinji Takamatsu explained that TV Tokyo cancelled the rerun on its own. Renhō's representative denied having objected to the episode although a report from the Mainichi Shimbun paper stated the affected party contacted TV Tokyo. When the story arc the episode belonged to was completed, Takamatsu expressed doubts about the arc's release in DVD format.|$|E
5|$|In January 1938 E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company filed a $150,000 libel {{claim against}} Lundberg and his publisher, Vanguard Press, over {{what it said}} were false and <b>defamatory</b> remarks {{contained}} in the book about {{the company and the}} DuPont family, specifically that DuPont had defrauded the U.S. government on contracts during World War I. In settlement of the suit, Lundberg and Vanguard issued a full retraction of the claim.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} if free speech is to be favoured over the protection of reputation in applying a Reynolds-type defence, another issue {{that will have to}} be considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests. In this connection, Chan C.J. said that the court would have to decide whether freedom of expression is to be given preference over the protection of reputation, whether it is a fundamental right that trumps the protection of reputation unless it is shown that the <b>defamatory</b> statement was made maliciously, or whether it is co-equal with the protection of reputation.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, the Channel 4 {{television}} {{comedy series}} Star Stories broadcast a satirical mockumentary of Mills's life story from her point of view. In 2009, after petitioning the Press Complaints Commission in the UK about being lied {{about in the}} press, five British tabloids (The Sun, The Daily Express, News of the World, Sunday Mirror and Daily Mirror) publicly apologised to Mills about printing false, hurtful or <b>defamatory</b> stories about her. Another tabloid (the Daily Mail), sent a private letter of apology. Mills has complained that over 4,400 abusive articles about her have been published.|$|E
5|$|Radio City Music Hall's {{management}} {{refused to}} screen Citizen Kane for its premiere. A possible factor was Parsons's threat that The American Weekly would run a <b>defamatory</b> {{story on the}} grandfather of major RKO stockholder Nelson Rockefeller. Other exhibitors feared being sued for libel by Hearst and refused to show the film. In March Welles threatened the RKO board of governors with a lawsuit {{if they did not}} release the film. Schaefer stood by Welles and opposed the board of governors. When RKO still delayed the film's release Welles offered to buy the film for $1 million and the studio finally agreed to release the film on May 1.|$|E
5|$|Ravalomanana's {{announcement}} sparked retaliatory {{actions by}} the Ratsiraka administration, resulting in frequent <b>defamatory</b> attacks {{in the press and}} a court judgment fining him 300 billion Malagasy francs (55.6 million Euros) in unpaid back taxes, and two other lawsuits in relation to his management of Tiko, which were later settled out of court. These attacks were denounced by spokesmen for Ravalomanana's campaign support network, Tiako iMadagasikara (TIM), and in speeches the candidate delivered in urban and rural areas across the island, with travel made possible by his considerable personal wealth and the airplane and seven distribution helicopters registered to Tiko. Tiko distribution channels were used to distribute posters, baseball caps, tee-shirts and other promotional materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{work had}} been {{commissioned}} jointly by the Houston Grand Opera, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Netherlands Opera and the Washington Opera, {{all of which were}} to mount early productions of the opera. Fearful that the work might be challenged as <b>defamatory</b> or not in the public domain, Houston Grand Opera obtained insurance to cover such an eventuality. Before its stage premiere, the opera was presented in concert form in May 1987 in San Francisco, with intermission discussions led by Adams. According to the Los Angeles Times review, a number of audience members left as the work proceeded.|$|E
5|$|Electronic Frontier Foundation {{attorney}} Corynne McSherry and Paul Levy of Public Citizen {{commented on}} the case to Ars Technica, calling Beck's trademark claim before the WIPO ridiculous. The Citizen Media Law Project agreed with this assessment. Levy noted that domain names, in and of themselves, {{could be seen as}} defamatory; however, the statement in the domain name would have to be deemed both false and malicious. Levy and McSherry thought that the filing may have been to ascertain Eiland-Hall's identity, which was anonymous prior to the complaint. McSherry couldn't recall a prior case where an individual asserted a domain name was libelous. Jack Bremer of The First Post wrote that the attempt by Beck's lawyers arguing the domain name of the website was itself <b>defamatory</b> had likely never occurred before in the field of information technology law.|$|E
5|$|In May 1762, the {{incumbent}} Whig {{government of the}} Duke of Newcastle was replaced with one led by the Scottish Tory Lord Bute. Bute's opponents worked against him by spreading the calumny {{that he was having}} an affair with the King's mother, and by exploiting anti-Scottish prejudices amongst the English. John Wilkes, a Member of Parliament, published The North Briton, which was both inflammatory and <b>defamatory</b> in its condemnation of Bute and the government. Wilkes was eventually arrested for seditious libel but he fled to France to escape punishment; he was expelled from the House of Commons, and found guilty in absentia of blasphemy and libel. In 1763, after concluding the Peace of Paris which ended the war, Lord Bute resigned, allowing the Whigs under George Grenville to return to power.|$|E
5|$|Madison, {{a member}} of the Democratic-Republican Party, was elected to the Democratic-Republican-dominated Virginia General Assembly from Orange County in 1799. A major item on his agenda was the defense of the General Assembly's 1798 Virginia Resolutions, of which Madison had been the draftsman. The Resolutions, usually {{discussed}} together with Thomas Jefferson's contemporaneous Kentucky Resolutions, were a response to various perceived outrages perpetrated by the Federalist-dominated national government. The most significant of these were the Alien and Sedition Acts, four laws that allowed the President to deport aliens at will, required a longer period of residence before aliens could become citizens, and made it a crime to publish malicious or <b>defamatory</b> material against the government or its officials. Democratic-Republicans were outraged by the legislation, and Madison and Jefferson drafted the highly critical Resolutions adopted in response by the Virginia and Kentucky state legislatures.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after 7:00 am on 30 December 2010, Christopher Jefferies, Yeates' {{landlord}} {{who lived}} in the same building, was arrested on suspicion of her murder. He was taken to a local police station for questioning while forensic investigators inspected his flat. On 31 December, a senior police officer granted investigators a 12-hour extension to the arrest, enabling them to hold him in custody for additional questioning. Police subsequently applied to magistrates for further extensions which were granted on 31 December and 1 January. Investigators were able to detain him as a suspect for up to 96 hours, but released Jefferies on bail after two days. He retained the legal services of the law firm Stokoe Partnership to act on his behalf. On 4 March 2011, police released him from bail and stated he was no longer a suspect. He subsequently won an undisclosed sum in libel damages for <b>defamatory</b> news articles published following his arrest, and received an apology from Avon and Somerset Police for any distress caused to him during the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The {{advantages}} to this method were that bills were substantially cheaper, and unlike writs did not tie the plaintiff down; once the case came to court the bill could be amended to include any action or actions the plaintiff wanted to enforce. In addition, by avoiding the Chancery writ, {{the case was}} substantially cheaper. The result of this was substantial; between 1560 and 1640, the King's Bench's business rose tenfold. This period also saw a substantial broadening of the remedies available in the common law. The main remedy and method was action on the case, which justices expanded to encompass other things. In 1499 it enabled the enforcement of parol promises, which rendered Chancery subpoenas obsolete; later developments included the recovery of debts, suing for <b>defamatory</b> words (previously an ecclesiastical matter) and action on the case for trover and conversion. Most of this reform took place under Fineux CJ, who never lived {{to see the results}} of his work; it took over 100 years for the reforms to fully reverse the decline in business.|$|E

25|$|RPK had in reply, filed a {{statement}} of defence on 25 November 2008 denying that the three articles were false, malicious or <b>defamatory</b> of Shafee.|$|E
25|$|February 2007: Fuzzy Zoeller sued a Miami firm because <b>defamatory</b> {{information}} {{was added to}} his Wikipedia biography in an anonymous edit that came from their network.|$|E
25|$|Art Schreiber, an {{attorney}} for Werner Erhard and his organization Werner Erhard and Associates, stated {{that the fact that}} a <b>defamatory</b> statement had previously been published in another publication was not a proper defense against a possible claim of libel.|$|E
25|$|Irving's {{decision}} to file his lawsuit in the English courts {{gave him the}} upper hand by shifting the burden of proof. Under American libel law, a public figure {{who claims to have}} been libelled must prove that the statements in question are <b>defamatory,</b> that they are false, and that they were made with actual malice or with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity. Furthermore, reliance on reliable sources (even if they prove false) is a valid defence. In contrast, English libel law requires only that the claimant show that the statements are <b>defamatory.</b> The burden of proof falls on the defendant to prove that the statements were substantially true, and reliance on sources is irrelevant.|$|E
25|$|In January 2013, Ganley {{received}} an apology and a €50 donation {{to a charity}} in an out of court settlement over a <b>defamatory</b> Twitter comment made about him. That same month, he agreed to pay expenses of failed Libertas candidate Raymond O'Malley.|$|E
25|$|All states except Arizona, Missouri, and Tennessee {{recognize}} that some categories of false statements are so innately harmful {{that they are}} considered to be <b>defamatory</b> per se. In the common law tradition, damages for such false statements are presumed and {{do not have to be}} proven.|$|E
25|$|O'Connor was {{subjected}} to prolonged criticism {{by members of the}} press and also many members of the Western Australian Parliament over the scheme. John Forrest, always a supporter, had left Western Australian politics to become federal defence minister; <b>defamatory</b> attacks by the press had wounded him.|$|E
25|$|Zeman has a {{long history}} of losing {{lawsuits}} regarding his public comments. In 1993 Zeman lost his lawsuit over his <b>defamatory</b> statement towards former police officer Milan Hruška. He falsely accused him of lack of intelligence and inadequate education. Zeman was fined, but ignored the court ruling and never apologised.|$|E
25|$|On 21 March 2012, Ramsay filed a $2.7 million {{lawsuit against}} his former {{partners}} of his restaurant in Montreal, Quebec, the Laurier Gordon Ramsay (since renamed The Laurier 1936), over lost licensing fees and <b>defamatory</b> statements made against him. On 16 April 2013, {{just over a}} year later, Laurier 1936 closed.|$|E
25|$|On May 22, 2013, Canseco {{was named}} {{as a suspect}} in a rape {{allegation}} in Las Vegas. He broke the news himself on Twitter, denying the allegations and posting pictures and <b>defamatory</b> information about his accuser. On June 7, 2013, Canseco was cleared of any wrongdoing following an investigation. He was never charged.|$|E
25|$|One {{defense is}} {{reporting}} or passing through information {{as a general}} information or warning of dangerous or emergency conditions, and intent to defame must be proven. Also, {{the truth of the}} allegedly <b>defamatory</b> statement will always negate the claim (whether because the plaintiff fails to meet his/her burden of proving falsity or because the defendant proves the statement to be true).|$|E
25|$|Following a {{substantial}} delay, an appeal from the Rights Commissioner's recommendation {{by the university}} commenced at the Employment Appeals Tribunal in July 2009 and continued in December 2009 and January 2010. During the hearing in 2009 there was significant emphasis on statements made by the lecturer in his blog throughout 2009, which were deemed by von Prondzynski and others to be highly <b>defamatory.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hopkins {{has been}} criticised by journalists, {{advocacy}} groups and politicians for her comments about migrants, and accused of racism. In 2016, Mail Online {{was forced to}} pay £150,000 to a Muslim family whom Hopkins had falsely accused of extremist links; and in a 2017 libel case, Hopkins was personally required to pay £24,000 in damages and £107,000 in legal costs to Jack Monroe after making <b>defamatory</b> remarks on Twitter.|$|E
25|$|Peter Damon sued Moore {{in federal}} court for $85 million, alleging that the film gave a false {{impression}} and was <b>defamatory.</b> Moore's attorney argued in response that the film quoted Damon verbatim and did not take his statements out of context nor give a false impression. The judge agreed and dismissed Damon's suit. In March 2008, the First Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the ruling in Moore's favor.|$|E
25|$|Falwell filed a $10 million {{lawsuit against}} Penthouse for {{publishing}} an article based upon interviews {{he gave to}} freelance reporters, after failing to convince a federal court to place an injunction upon the publication of that article. The suit was dismissed in Federal district court {{on the grounds that}} the article was not <b>defamatory</b> or an invasion of Falwell's privacy (the Virginia courts had not recognized this privacy tort, which is recognized in other states).|$|E
25|$|On January 10, 2013, 22 Porter {{ground crew}} members {{went on strike}} in Toronto. This was the airline's first labour dispute since it began business. In April 2013, Porter filed a libel lawsuit against the Canadian Office and Professional Employees union {{representing}} the 22 striking workers. Porter suit was for $4 million in damages for alleged <b>defamatory</b> statements made by the union using its Twitter account. The strike was settled in June 2013, and Porter's lawsuit was dropped.|$|E
25|$|However, in India, {{the weight}} of the {{authorities}} is for discarding between libel and slander and making both of them actionable per se. In UK, only libel and certain types of slander is actionable per se. Criminal libel in UK was abolished in 2010, while both slander and libel remain criminal offences in India, making people liable not just to the extent of damages but also undergoing imprisonment. An injunction may also be granted to stop further publication of <b>defamatory</b> material.|$|E
25|$|Lindsay, {{one of the}} league's top players, {{was first}} {{stripped}} of his captaincy, then {{was traded to the}} struggling Chicago Black Hawks. Jack Adams then planted rumors about Lindsay and false <b>defamatory</b> comments by him against his old team in the press, and showed a fake contract to the press, showing an inflated annual salary. The ruse worked and the Red Wings players rejected the union. Harvey suffered a similar fate, being traded from Montreal to the New York Rangers.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Pagones {{was awarded}} $345,000 (he sought $395 million) through a lawsuit for {{defamation}} of character {{that he had}} brought against Sharpton, Maddox and Mason. The jury found Sharpton liable for making seven <b>defamatory</b> statements about Pagones, Maddox for two and Mason for one. The jury deadlocked on four of the 22 statements over which Pagones had sued, and it found eight statements to be non-defamatory. In a later interview, Pagones said the turmoil caused by the accusations of Brawley and her advisers had cost him his first marriage and much personal grief.|$|E
