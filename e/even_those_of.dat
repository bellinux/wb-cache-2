It was not his relationship to Lord Rockingham, though no doubt an advantage, nor his princely fortune, though a yet greater, which conferred the sort of importance he enjoyed for half a century in this country. He derived it more directly and more certainly from his goodness and generosity, and from the combination of gentleness and courage which distinguished his amiable and unpretending character.

25|$|The Spanish {{explorer}} Francisco de Orellana, the 16th century explorer who was {{the first}} European to traverse the Amazon River, reported densely populated regions running hundreds of kilometers along the river, suggesting population levels exceeding <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> today. These populations left no lasting monuments, possibly because they used local wood as their construction material, which would have rotted in the humid climate (stone was unavailable). While it is possible Orellana may have exaggerated the level of development among the Amazonians, their semi-nomadic descendants have the odd distinction among tribal indigenous societies of a hereditary, yet landless, aristocracy, a historical anomaly for a society without a sedentary, agrarian culture. This suggests they once were more settled and agrarian but became nomadic after the demographic collapse of the 16th and 17th century, due to European-introduced diseases, while still maintaining certain traditions. Moreover, many indigenous peoples adapted to a more mobile lifestyle in order to escape colonialism. This might have made the benefits of terra preta, such as its self-renewing capacity, less attractivefarmers {{would not have been able}} to employ the renewed soil as they migrated for safety. Slash-and-char might have been an adaptation to these conditions.|$|E
25|$|Patriarchy {{is related}} to {{institutionalized}} control, and not merely people’s individual sexism. Much {{research has been done}} to understand why females are stereotypically believed to occupy a domestic character while males are projected to pursue qualified fulfillment outside of the household. Patriarchal structures of discrimination and oppression historically established male privilege by denying females the right to political involvement, in so doing lessening if not eradicating their chances to contribute in the regulations that circumscribe their life. This disunion of work is often plotted onto a social ladder where men's choice to go {{out of the house and}} assumed control over females is seen as foremost. Although each society has to have headship and control, patriarchy has thoroughly subjected females to manipulation, abuse, and subordination. Traditionally, patriarchy gave the father of the family complete possession over the spouse or wives, children, etc. as well as the ability to perform physical exploitation and every so often <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> manslaughter and auction. In certain cases, the juncture of patriarchy as privilege and authority and conceptual ideas of females as properties can habitually turn out to be established into a “rape culture” where rape and further versions of violence toward females are recognized as a usual part of the social order. For example, from the 1900s into the 2000s, Serbs in Croatia, Kosovo, and Bosnia used rape of females as a usual tactic of combat to chastise and threaten inhabitants seen as lesser. Since the government enacts responsibilities and civil liberties, it increases the inquiry of the role of the government in gendering progressions.|$|E

Beria's proposals were designed to denigrate Stalin and pass the blame for Beria's own crimes to the late leader. One proposal, which was adopted, was an amnesty which eventually led to the freeing of over a million prisoners. Another, which was not, was to release East Germany into a united, neutral Germany in exchange for compensation from the West—a proposal considered by Khrushchev to be anti-communist. Khrushchev allied with Malenkov to block many of Beria's proposals, while the two slowly picked up support from other Presidium members.

500|$|Under {{standard}} conditions, silver {{does not}} form simple carbonyls, {{due to the}} weakness of the Ag–C bond. A few are known at very low temperatures around 6–15K, such as the green, planar paramagnetic Ag(CO)3, which dimerizes at 25–30K, probably by forming Ag–Ag bonds. Additionally, the silver carbonyl [...] is known. Polymeric AgLX complexes with alkenes and alkynes are known, but their bonds are thermodynamically weaker than <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the platinum complexes (though they are formed more readily than those of the analogous gold complexes): they are also quite unsymmetrical, showing the weak ' bonding in group 11. Ag–C ' bonds may also be formed by silver(I), like copper(I) and gold(I), but the simple alkyls and aryls of silver(I) are even less stable than those of copper(I) (which tend to explode under ambient conditions). For example, poor thermal stability is reflected in the relative decomposition temperatures of AgMe (−50°C) and CuMe (−15°C) {{as well as those of}} PhAg (74°C) and PhCu (100°C).|$|E
500|$|As Thomas Asbridge wrote, [...] "Just {{as we can}} {{do nothing}} more than {{estimate}} the number of thousands {{who responded to the}} crusading ideal, so too, with the surviving evidence, we can gain only a limited insight into their motivation and intent." [...] Previous generations of scholars argued that the crusaders were motivated by greed, hoping to find a better life away from the famines and warfare occurring in France, but as Asbridge notes, [...] "This image is ... profoundly misleading." [...] He argues that greed was unlikely to have been a major factor because of the extremely high cost of travelling so far from home, and because almost all of the crusaders eventually returned home after completing their pilgrimage rather than trying to carve out possessions for themselves in the Holy Land. It is difficult or impossible to assess the motives of the thousands of poor for whom there is no historical record, or <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> important knights, whose stories were usually retold by monks or clerics. As the secular medieval world was so deeply ingrained with the spiritual world of the church, it is quite likely that personal piety was a major factor for many crusaders.|$|E
500|$|In Paris Meyerbeer {{had been}} asked by Louis Véron, the {{director}} of the Opéra, for a new work. At first he attempted to persuade Véron to accept the opéra-comique Le portefaix to a libretto by Scribe, which he had been contracted to compose in early 1831; but Véron insisted on a full five-act piece. Together with Scribe, Meyerbeer reviewed many subjects before deciding, in 1832, on Les Huguenots. The contract which Meyerbeer signed with Véron contained a penalty clause if the work was not delivered by the end of 1833. When the time came and the opera was not ready, Véron claimed his 30,000 francs under this clause; Meyerbeer was perhaps unique amongst composers in being able to pay this. In fact Véron refunded the money under a further agreement, when the opera was delivered in late 1834; but Veron himself was replaced as director of the Opera by Henri Duponchel before Les Huguenots was premiered on 29 February 1836. It was an immediate and immense success, its splendid staging and effects exceeding <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Fromental Halévy's La Juive, which had premiered the previous year. Berlioz called the score [...] "a musical encyclopaedia", and the singing, especially of Nourrit and Falcon, was universally praised. Les Huguenots was the first opera to be performed at the Opéra more than 1,000 times (the 1,000th performance being on 16 May 1906) and continued to be produced up to 1936, more than a century after its premiere. Its many performances in all other of the world's major opera houses give it a claim to being the most successful opera of the 19th century.|$|E

500|$|Nuptial flight usually {{occurs during}} spring, in October. Reproductive females only mate {{with a single}} male and begin {{establishing}} their own colonies afterwards. Nuptial flight occurs after rain, where the males emerge from their nest first, followed by the virgin queens; groups of 20 to 40 females emerge after the males have flown away. The alates (the reproductive males and females) position themselves {{on top of the}} nest in order to heat themselves, and all fly at the same time once they are warm. This process may happen multiple times unless the weather had changed, otherwise, the queens would return to their nest. Nuptial flight may continue for days until all virgin queens have withdrawn from the nest. Most of the time, a single queen will start her own colony and lay eggs that will take around 44 to 61 days to fully develop and emerge as adults, but colonies can also be founded through multiple queens cooperating with each other, adoption into an existing colony, or [...] "budding" [...] (also called [...] "satelliting" [...] or [...] "fractionating"), where a subset of the colony including queens, workers and brood (eggs, larvae and pupae) leave the main colony for an alternative nest site. Around 10% of queens will have at least another queen with them during colony foundation. Many queens are killed during colony founding; major aspects include predation by birds and other ants, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the same species, due to the fact they attempt to establish their nests near large colonies. However, some queens are successful, sometimes with the assistance of neighbouring workers, who help the queen dig some chambers. Other causes of queen deaths include disease and starvation. A queen's ovaries may take four weeks to mature, and she lays around 20 eggs that may develop into larvae in less than a month. Workers have been observed laying eggs, presumably trophic eggs. The function of these unfertilised eggs are nutritional, not reproduction.|$|E
