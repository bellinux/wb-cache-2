Materials and Methods:Overall, 50 patients {{were included in}} this non randomized match-pair analysis: 25 patients who had undergone Laparoscopic Radical Cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer (Group- 1) and 25 patients with similar characteristics who had undergone Open Radical Cystectomy (Group- 2). The patients were operated from January 2005 to December 2012 in a single Institution. Results:Mean operative time <b>for</b> <b>groups</b> 1 and <b>2</b> were 350 and 280 minutes (p= 0. 03) respectively. Mean blood loss was 330 mL <b>for</b> <b>group</b> 1 and 580 mL <b>for</b> <b>group</b> <b>2</b> (p= 0. 04). Intraoperative transfusion rate was 0 % and 36 % <b>for</b> <b>groups</b> 1 and <b>2</b> respectively (p= 0. 005). Perioperative complication rate was similar between groups. Mean time to oral intake was <b>2</b> days <b>for</b> <b>group</b> 1 and 3 days <b>for</b> <b>group</b> <b>2</b> (p= 0. 08).

There were no differences in positive surgical margins and overall survival, between groups. Conclusions:In a reference center with pelvic laparoscopic expertise, Laparoscopic Radical Cystectomy may be considered a safe procedure with similar complication rate of Open Radical Cystectomy. Laparoscopic Radical Cystectomy is more time consuming, with reduced bleeding and transfusion rate. Hospital stay seems to be shorter.

40|$|Patients with obstructive hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) exhibit elevated left ventricular outflow tract gradients (LVOTGs) {{and appear to}} have a worse prognosis than those with nonobstructive HCM. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether patients with obstruction, compared with nonobstruc-tive HCM, demonstrate significant differences in PET parame-ters of microvascular function. Methods: PET was performed in 33 symptomatic HCM patients at rest and during dipyridamole stress (peak) for the assessment of regional myocardial perfu-sion (rMP), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), myocardial blood flow (MBF), and myocardial flow reserve (MFR). Myocar-dial wall thickness and LVOTG were measured with an echo-cardiogram. Patients were divided into the following 3 groups: nonobstructive (LVOTG, 30 mm Hg at rest and after provoca-tion test with amyl nitrite), obstructive (LVOTG $ 30 mm Hg at rest and with provocation), and latent HCM (LVOTG, 30 at rest but $ 30 mm Hg with provocation).

A total of 120 Dutch outpatients with AS were randomly allocated into 3 groups of 40 patients each. Group 1 was treated in a spa resort in Bad Hofgastein, Austria; <b>group</b> <b>2</b> in a spa resort in Arcen, The Netherlands. The control group stayed at home and continued their usual activities and standard treatment during the intervention weeks. After the intervention, all patients followed weekly group physical therapy. The total study period was 40 weeks. Effectiveness of the intervention was assessed by functional ability using the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Function Index (BASFI). Utilities were measured with the EuroQoL (EQ- 5 D(utility)).

Retrospective study of patients who had combined phaco+IOL and DSAEK (group 1) or phaco+IOL followed within 2 months by DSAEK (<b>group</b> <b>2).</b> Patients who had previous eye surgery or any other ocular comorbidities were excluded. Results. There were 28 eyes in group 1 and 31 in <b>group</b> <b>2.</b> There {{were no significant differences}} in the demographics and corneal tissue characteristics of the two groups. The endothelial disc dislocation and rebubbling rate within 1 week in group 1 was 21. 42 % and in <b>group</b> <b>2</b> was 3. 2 % P= 0. 04, while the endothelial cell density at 12 months was 1510 ± 433 <b>for</b> <b>group</b> 1 and 1535 ± 482 <b>for</b> <b>group</b> <b>2</b> P= 0. 89. The mean 12 -month logMAR visual acuity was 0. 28 ± 0. 24 <b>for</b> <b>group</b> 1 and 0. 33 ± 0. 15 <b>for</b> <b>group</b> <b>2</b> P= 0. 38. Conclusions. Although the combined procedure seems to be associated with a higher complication rate the final outcomes seem to be similar to both methods...|$|R

40|$|Twenty-three {{dogs with}} heart failure were {{evaluated}} in a 12 -month study by measuring baseline plasma {{atrial natriuretic peptide}} (ANP) concentrations. Ten dogs were classified as having mild to moderate cardiac disease (group 1) and 13 dogs were classified as having severe cardiac disease (<b>group</b> <b>2).</b> The mean plasma ANP concentration <b>for</b> the <b>group</b> 1 dogs was 64 ± 45 pg/mL and <b>for</b> the <b>group</b> <b>2</b> dogs, 328 ± 122 pg/mL. The median survival time (1095 d) <b>for</b> <b>group</b> 1 dogs was significantly greater (P < 0. 05) than <b>for</b> <b>group</b> <b>2</b> dogs (58 d). A significantly (P, 0. 05) greater median survival was noted for dogs with plasma ANP, 95 pg/mL (1095 d) compared with those with ANP. 95 pg/mL (58 d). Plasma ANP concentrations are a potential noninvasive predictor of survival in dogs with heart failure...|$|R
40|$|Aim. To {{compare the}} {{surgical}} outcomes of surgery {{with and without}} bicanalicular silicon tube intubation {{for the treatment of}} patients who have primary uncomplicated nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Methods. This retrospective study is comprised of 113 patients with uncomplicated primary nasolacrimal duct obstruction. There were <b>2</b> <b>groups</b> in the study: Group 1 (n= 58) patients underwent transcanalicular diode laser dacryocystorhinostomy surgery with bicanalicular silicon tube intubation and <b>Group</b> <b>2</b> (n= 55) patients underwent transcanalicular diode laser dacryocystorhinostomy surgery without bicanalicular silicon tube intubation. The follow-up period was 18. 42 ± <b>2.</b> 8 months <b>for</b> <b>Group</b> 1 and 18. 8 ± <b>2.</b> 1 months <b>for</b> <b>Group</b> <b>2.</b> Results. Success was defined by irrigation of the lacrimal system without regurgitation and by the absence of epiphora. Success rates were 84. 4 % <b>for</b> <b>Group</b> 1 and 63. 6 % <b>for</b> <b>Group</b> <b>2</b> (P= 0. 011). Statistically a significant difference was found between the two groups. Conclusion. The results of the study showed that transcanalicular diode laser dacryocystorhinostomy surgery with bicanalicular silicon tube intubation was more successful than the other method of surgery. Consequently, the application of silicone tube intubation in transcanalicular diode laser dacryocystorhinostomy surgery is recommended...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeThis study {{serves to}} {{determine}} the effectiveness of either chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy to the thoracic spine or stretch and strengthening exercises (stretching the pectoralis major muscle and strengthening the rhomboid, middle and inferior trapezius muscles) versus the combined treatment of chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy to the thoracic spine in conjunction with stretch and strengthening exercises. MethodA randomised study design with thirty female participants {{between the ages of}} twenty and thirty nine was selected. Group 1 (n =  10) received chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy to the thoracic spine. <b>Group</b> <b>2</b> (n =  10) received chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy to the thoracic spine as well as stretch and strengthening exercises i. e. stretching the pectoralis major muscles and strengthening the rhomboid, middle and inferior trapezius muscles. Group 3 (n =  10) received stretch and strengthening exercises. The stretch and strengthening exercises were performed in the consultation rooms to ensure that the participants were complying with the treatment and doing the exercises properly. The study consisted of seven consultations <b>for</b> <b>Group</b> 1 (they received treatment once a week for six weeks) and <b>for</b> <b>Groups</b> <b>2</b> and 3 there were nineteen consultations (they received three treatments a week for six weeks). Objective data was recorded {{at the beginning of the}} first, fourth and seventh consultations <b>for</b> <b>Group</b> 1, and the first, tenth and nineteenth consultations <b>for</b> <b>Groups</b> <b>2</b> and 3. On the seventh consultation (<b>for</b> <b>Group</b> 1) and nineteenth consultation <b>for</b> <b>Groups</b> <b>2</b> and 3, only data collection was done. Objective data were obtained by using the Flexicurve® Ruler measurements for the angle of kyphosis. Visual analysis was done by taking lateral (sagittal) view photographs at the beginning of the initial and final consultations. ResultsStatistical analysis revealed significant statistical changes for the intragroup results <b>for</b> all three <b>groups.</b> No significant statistical difference was found between the <b>groups</b> <b>for</b> the inter-group analysis. ConclusionThe study showed that all three treatment protocols <b>for</b> <b>Groups</b> 1, <b>2,</b> and 3 were effective. However, Group 1 had not shown a great improvement in their postural kyphosis, Group 3 had shown a relatively good improvement in their posture, while <b>Group</b> <b>2</b> had shown the best results with regards to improvement of the participants' posture. Therefore, in conclusion, <b>Groups</b> <b>2</b> and 3 treatment protocols can be used effectively to treat postural kyphosis but <b>Group</b> <b>2</b> 's treatment protocol, consisting of chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy to the thoracic spine in combination with stretch and strengthening exercises, will yield the best results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract INTRODUCTION: Myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is {{the first}} cause of CNV in young patients. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the {{efficacy}} of intravitreal injections (IVT) of ranibizumab with photodynamic therapy (PDT) in this indication. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective comparative study analyzing the visual acuity (VA) outcomes of CNV myopic patients treated with either IVT or PDT. RESULTS: Twenty-seven eyes of 25 patients were treated with PDT (group 1) and 18 eyes of 17 patients were treated with IVT of ranibizumab (<b>group</b> <b>2).</b> Demographic data were similar in the two groups. The median initial VA was 20 / 80 <b>for</b> <b>group</b> 1 and 20 / 160 <b>for</b> <b>group</b> <b>2</b> (P= 0. 37). At 1 year, the median VA was 20 / 80 <b>for</b> <b>group</b> 1 (P= 0. 32) and 20 / 63 <b>for</b> <b>group</b> <b>2</b> (P= 0. 04). A significant improvement in VA was observed in 23. 1 % and in 27. 3 % of cases in <b>groups</b> 1 and <b>2,</b> respectively (P= 0. 53). A significant VA worsening was observed in 34. 6 % of cases in group 1 and in 9. 1 % of cases in <b>group</b> <b>2</b> (P= 0. 21). CONCLUSION: IVT of ranibizumab compared to PDT treatment showed greater efficacy in this study...|$|R
