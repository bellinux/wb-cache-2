40|$|A <b>hinge</b> (20) {{includes}} two <b>hinge</b> plates (22, 24) and a connecting <b>hinge</b> pin (32). A coil spring (48) supported on a bushing (44) overlies the <b>hinge</b> pin (32), which {{is free to}} move along its longitudinal axis (30). A cam follower (42) on the <b>hinge</b> pin (32) engages a cam (32) mounted {{to one of the}} <b>hinge</b> plates (22), so that the <b>hinge</b> pin (32) slides longitudinally as the <b>hinge</b> plates (22, 24) pivot relative to each other about the <b>hinge</b> pin (32). As the <b>hinge</b> pin (32) slides longitudinally, it axially compresses or decompresses the spring (48). The cam (32) is oriented such that pivoting of the <b>hinge</b> plates (22, 24) in either direction from an open position compresses the spring (48), providing a restoring force which tends to retain the <b>hinge</b> plates (22, 24) in the open position...|$|R
50|$|Spring hinge: a {{spring-loaded}} <b>hinge</b> made {{to provide}} assistance in the closing or {{the opening of the}} <b>hinge</b> leaves. A spring is a component of a <b>hinge,</b> that applies force to secure a <b>hinge</b> closed or keep a <b>hinge</b> opened.|$|R
40|$|A {{compact and}} aesthetically-pleasing {{self-closing}} door <b>hinge</b> comprises a gravity-assist feature and preferably a springassist feature, wherein the spring may be easily adjustable, replaceable, and even {{left out of}} the <b>hinge.</b> The preferred embodiment is reversible for easily changing from a rightopening to a left-opening door, and includes <b>hinge</b> lift-off capability, wherein the door and the blade connecting the door to the <b>hinge</b> body may be lifted up off the body of the <b>hinge</b> without any significant disassembly of the <b>hinge.</b> The spring is preferably placed aronnd the gravity-assist cams of the <b>hinge,</b> rather than above or below the cams, which arrangement significantly reduces the overall height of the <b>hinge</b> with only slightly increased diameter of the <b>hinge</b> main body. The preferred <b>hinge</b> has no bolts or other fasteners visible or protruding out from the main housing of the <b>hinge,</b> and the preferred <b>hinge</b> has no exposed spring sleeve...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the various exhibits, exhibitions and collections of Arts at the Airport, the Consolidated Rental Car Facility includes a large outdoor public art display by artist Ned Kahn. The installation includes {{a large number of}} alumnium sheets attached to <b>hinges</b> to the facade of the building designed to move with the wind, creating an undulating appearance {{to the surface of the}} building.|$|E
5|$|The canopy <b>hinges</b> open to {{the right}} and the pilot enters using the flip-down ladder. Once inside, the pilot sits low in the cockpit, {{protected}} by the bathtub assembly, which makes for a cramped cockpit. Visibility from the cockpit is limited, being a trade-off for improved pilot protection. Rearwards visibility is poor, though a periscope is fitted on top of the canopy to compensate.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hinge</b> screws — {{longer or}} {{specialized}} screws that prevent {{the door from}} being simply pulled out after removing the <b>hinge</b> pins. Often the <b>hinge</b> pin itself is screwed, from the inside while the door is open, into the <b>hinge</b> to prevent removal of the <b>hinge</b> pin without first opening the door.|$|R

5000|$|A {{floating}} <b>hinge</b> is a <b>hinge</b> that, while able {{to behave}} as a normal <b>hinge,</b> enables one of the objects {{to move away from}} the other - hence float. In effect the <b>hinge</b> allows for two parallel axes of rotation, one for each object joined by the <b>hinge,</b> and each axis can be moved relative to the position of the other.|$|R
5|$|The {{nineteenth century}} porch {{has a big}} ashlar triple-chamfered pointed arch, hoodmould and stone voussoirs. There is a boarded {{segmental}} pointed roof, stone side benches and a quarry tiles floor. There are three {{steps up to the}} fine oak double doors by Seddon, with wrought iron <b>hinges</b> and cambered lintel under an oak tympanum with roundel pierced with three leaded trefoils and a trefoil each side.|$|E
5|$|Between the Octagon and {{the main}} {{gatehouse}} in the north wall was a barbican, of which little survives– {{just a piece of}} the west wall– although the structure was originally two storeys high. The surviving fabric includes a slot for a portcullis for the barbican's north gate, although there are no <b>hinges</b> for gates. The base of a garderobe demonstrates that second storey would have provided space for habitation, probably a guard room. Drawings from the late 18th century show the ground floor of the barbican still standing and includes detail such as vaulting inside the passageway.|$|E
5|$|Green Grocer (set number: 10185) was {{the third}} of the Modular Buildings series. It was {{originally}} released in 2008. The set contains 2352 pieces and is recommended for builders 16 {{years of age or}} older. Some of the set features include a blue and white awning, opening doors and windows, detailed interiors to each room, a roof terrace, a fire escape, access to a courtyard behind the building, and 4 minifigures. Advanced building techniques used in Green Grocer include using black skeleton legs and hammers to make railings, using black spear guns as railings for the fire escape, using a paddle for a pendulum in a grandfather clock, and using <b>hinges</b> to make a bay window.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A novel flexure <b>hinge</b> named right {{circular}} corner filleted half hybrid flexure <b>hinge</b> was advanced. Based on the Castigliano second theorem, {{the compliance}} formulas {{of the novel}} flexure <b>hinge</b> were formulated. The theoretical calculations and the finite element simulations were performed simultaneously, the similar results were obtained which indicated the correctness of the compliance formulas. The influence of the geometric parameters of the novel flexure <b>hinge</b> on its performance was analysed. Compared with right circular corner filleted double hybrid flexure <b>hinge,</b> the compliance and sensitivity to the load of the novel half hybrid flexure <b>hinge</b> were better {{than that of the}} right circular corner filleted double hybrid flexure <b>hinge.</b> All of the above analysis results indicated the novel flexure <b>hinge</b> are more suitable for application in the compact structure and large displacement...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} {{and stability of}} a spin stabilized spacecraft with a <b>hinged</b> appendage system are treated analytically and numerically. The <b>hinged</b> system consists of a central hub with masses attached to massless booms of fixed length whose orientation relative to the main part can change. The equations of motion for the <b>hinged</b> system, with viscous damping at both <b>hinge</b> points, are linearized about the nominal equilibrium position where the booms are orthogonal to the nominal spin axis. Analytic stability criteria indicate that <b>hinge</b> damping must be present and that for limiting cases, where the spin axis is an axis of symmetry, certain conditions relating the <b>hinge</b> point offset coordinates to the moment of inertia ratio and end masses must be satisfied. The <b>hinge</b> damping is always required for the nominal deployment of <b>hinge</b> members...|$|R
5|$|In 1961, {{the castle}} was leased for 22 years by Anthony and Bunty Kinsman, {{at a cost}} of £1,000. The {{property}} required extensive structural repairs and renovations in order to be made habitable, which the Kinsmans undertook over the next two years. The construction work cost £8,596, and some financial support was provided by the Ministry of Works in exchange for the castle being opened to the public for the next fifteen years. The new oak doors in the castle were fitted with iron <b>hinges</b> that had originally been used in nearby Lowther Castle. In 1967, the castle was visited by Princess Sharada Shah, the daughter of the King Mahendra of Nepal, as part of an official trip to the UK.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Nakashima, Francois Sammer (a Czech {{architect}} {{who had worked}} for Le Corbusier in Russia) and Chandulal (a devotee who had trained as an engineer), built a full-scale model of the dormitory in order to test the feasibility of the design, and then used it as a laboratory to further refine the construction methods. Nakashima's duties included doing very explicit detail drawings showing, for example, the design of the concrete formwork. Devotees even donated brass utensils so that they could be melted down to make door handles and <b>hinges.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 10 March 1859 {{the last}} {{subscriber}} {{to the main}} tontine died, having for over five years received the full £800 per annum set aside for subscribers to the first tontine, and {{with the death of}} its last member the scheme expired. On 25 March 1859 Richmond Bridge became toll-free. A large procession made its way to the bridge, where a team of labourers symbolically removed toll gates from their <b>hinges.</b> The toll houses were demolished, replaced by seating in 1868; investment income from the revenue accumulated during the 83years the tolls had been charged was sufficient to pay for the bridge's maintenance.|$|E
50|$|The {{shells of}} most of these animals are T-shaped, with the <b>hinge</b> {{along the top of}} the T, and with the byssus {{emerging}} from the <b>hinge.</b> An oblique ligament holds the <b>hinge.</b> The shell is partially nacreous. There is a single, large adductor muscle. The exhalant current exits at the <b>hinge.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the desmodont <b>hinge,</b> {{also known}} as an asthenodont <b>hinge,</b> the <b>hinge</b> {{consists}} of a large ligamentous resilifer (or chondrophore) which replaces the cardinal teeth, as in the soft-shell clams (Myidae).|$|R

5|$|Paley's Natural Theology is an {{extended}} argument, constructed around {{a series of}} examples including finding a watch; comparing the eye to a telescope; {{and the existence of}} finely adapted mechanical structures in animals, such as joints which function like <b>hinges</b> or manmade ball and socket joints. Paley argues that these all lead to an intelligent Creator, and that a system is {{more than the sum of}} its parts. The last chapters are more theological in character, arguing that the attributes of God must be sufficient for the extent of his operations, and that God must be good because designs seen in nature are beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} first floor and {{continuing}} to the third, black and white floor tiling is made of Vermont marble and limestone. The exception is {{the floor of the}} rotunda which is composed of 976 blocks of translucent glass. The blocks vary in size so that when viewed from the upper floors, they appear to form a bowl which mirrors the dome above. The doorknobs are mostly made of a brass and bronze alloy (most of the original brass doorknobs have disappeared over time). The present doorknobs and <b>hinges,</b> locked for protection, display the state coat of arms. Though the building appears to have walnut woodwork, the wood is Michigan white pine that has been wood-grained to give the appearance of walnut.|$|E

40|$|We {{present one}} <b>hinged</b> {{dissection}} of a square {{that can be}} folded into every letter of a polyabolo alphabet. <b>Hinged</b> dissections. <b>Hinged</b> dissection is a particular form of dissection in which one shape is sliced into pieces and <b>hinged</b> at their vertices so that the mechanism can be folded into another shape or shapes. The classic example is the <b>hinged</b> dissection of an equilateral triangle to a square described by Dudeney and shown in Figure 1; see [1] {{for the history of}} this dissection, as well as some other <b>hinged</b> dissections. Recently, Frederickson [2] has written a book devoted entirely to <b>hinged</b> dissections and techniques for designing them. Figure 1 : <b>Hinged</b> dissection of an equilateral triangle into a square [1]. Theory. An intriguing open problem is whether every pair of polygons has a <b>hinged</b> dissection. Recently, there have been two interesting results addressing this problem. Eppstein [3] showed how to hinge-dissect any polygon into its mirror image. Eppstein, Frederickson, Friedman, and the present authors [4] demonstrated a wide family of <b>hinged</b> dissections for polyforms, that is, shapes made up of repeated copies of a common polygon glued togethe...|$|R
5|$|Arguments rumbled on {{and there}} were endless delays. Early {{versions}} of the sticky bomb were prone to leaks as well as breakage in transport. There were understandable concerns over the explosive charge: pure nitroglycerin is notoriously susceptible to the slightest knock, but the mixture developed by ICI proved to be very safe even if it should get into the <b>hinges</b> of the storage boxes. By December 1940, fewer than 66,000 had been produced {{and the rate of}} production was disappointing at five to ten thousand per week. Further, it was suggested that the original order of one million be reduced to 200,000. Minor improvements to the design were made, of which the most significant was to replace the glass flask with plastic. Finally, after passing all the required tests, the sticky bomb – now the No 74 Grenade Mk II – was accepted by the Ordnance Board; it was put into full-scale production and it became a service issue.|$|E
5|$|As the {{reputation}} of the Mars Works grew, so too did the demand for its products. After a few years the Mars Works began exporting its engines inland. Oliver Evans's son George was the first such order, having moved to Pittsburgh in 1809 to operate the Pittsburgh Steam Flour Mill. George and the mill were highly successful, and generated a great deal of interest in Evans's engines across the interior. However exporting engines to western Pennsylvania, Kentucky or Ohio was challenging and expensive from a logistical perspective. In 1811 Evans and George, as well as another successful steam miller and engineer Luther Stephens, founded the Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company, which in addition to engines would, like the Mars Works, produce heavy machinery and castings in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. With high demand for industrial products and relatively little industrial capacity, the Pittsburgh works added to its repertoire the capacity for brasswork, as well as producing finer products for domestic purposes like <b>hinges</b> and fittings.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Soul Reaver, 1500 years later, Kain is a despotic emperor, his vampires {{dominate}} the land, and Nosgoth <b>hinges</b> {{on the brink of}} collapse. The Elder God, a demiurge-like entity, lurks beneath Nosgoth and controls the cycle of reincarnation; the vampires, whose biological immortality opposes his doctrine, are his enemies. In Soul Reaver, Raziel—Kain's lieutenant—is executed by Kain, but The Elder God resurrects him and encourages him to exact revenge. Traversing the wasteland and murdering the vampires, Raziel confronts Kain, who attacks him with the Soul Reaver sword, imbued with a spirit which absorbs its victims' souls. The Soul Reaver shatters when it strikes Raziel, and the blade's spirit binds itself to his arm. His motives still mysterious, Kain lures Raziel through a time portal into Nosgoth's past.|$|E
40|$|Half-scale {{models of}} two-way column-footing <b>hinge</b> {{connections}} were tested under constant axial load and reversed cyclic lateral load. In {{one of the}} specimens, the column and <b>hinge</b> were circular in cross section; in the other specimen, the column and <b>hinge</b> were square in cross section. The main objective {{was to assess the}} seismic performance of these details, which are common in existing bridge structures in moderate seismic regions. The test results confirmed that the lateral column displacement was due almost entirely to rotations in the <b>hinge.</b> Horizontal slip at the <b>hinge</b> and flexural deformation in the column were insignificant prior to <b>hinge</b> gap closure, which occurred at large column displacements. <b>Hinge</b> gap closure resulted in sudden increases in stiffness and strength, but these increases occurred at column displacements which would be excessive in the prototype structure. The <b>hinge</b> responses are characterized by hysteretic pinching, poor energy absorption and significant stiffness degradation.
