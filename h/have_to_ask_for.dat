5|$|As {{with many}} banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found it {{increasingly}} difficult or impossible to roll over their loans in the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> a loan from the central bank as the lender of last resort. However, in Iceland the banks were so {{much larger than the}} national economy that the Central Bank of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.|$|E
500|$|Despite earning {{critical}} acclaim and a sizable fanbase, commercial success eluded the group. Early in their career, their 1993 EP Jenny Ondioline entered the UK Singles Chart, but financial issues prevented the band from printing enough records to satisfy demand. When Elektra Records was closed down by Warner Bros. Records in 2004, Stereolab was dropped {{along with many}} other artists, reportedly because of poor sales. Since then, Stereolab's self-owned label Duophonic has inked a worldwide distribution deal with independent label Too Pure. Through Duophonic the band both licenses their music and releases it directly (depending on geographic market). According to Tim Gane, [...] "...we license our recordings and just give them to people, then we don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> permission if we want to use it. We just want to be in control of our own music." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the shock}} {{exit from the}} Confederations Cup with Spain, Villa {{returned}} from his holidays on 27 July amidst much media speculation linking him with top clubs such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United. Villa quelled such rumours after announcing his desire to remain at the Mestalla to fulfil his contract, underlining that he [...] "could not spend all summer refuting things, so I wanted to be quiet... I was told I should leave Valencia {{for the good of}} the club, soon after that everything changed and from that moment on I never saw myself out of here – before the Euros, the club told me what my asking price was, and I thought they were going to sell me, but when I returned from my vacations, Vicente Soriano said that he did not want me to leave Valencia. That removed all doubt for me. There is no train missed because all that I have achieved is because of Valencia and the Spanish national team." [...] When questioned on whether or not he should apologise to Valencia fans, he simply replied, [...] "I did not kill anyone, I do not think I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> forgiveness." ...|$|E

500|$|Ganesha {{does not}} appear in the Indian epic {{literature}} that is dated to the Vedic period. [...] A late interpolation to the epic poem Mahabharata says that the sage Vyasa (...) asked Ganesha to serve as his scribe to transcribe the poem as he dictated it to him. Ganesha agreed but only on condition that Vyasa recites the poem uninterrupted, that is, without pausing. The sage agreed but found that to get any rest he needed to recite very complex passages so Ganesha would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> clarifications. The story is not accepted as part of the original text by the editors of the critical edition of the Mahabharata, in which the twenty-line story is relegated to a footnote in an appendix. The story of Ganesha acting as the scribe occurs in 37 of the 59 manuscripts consulted during preparation of the critical edition. Ganesha's association with mental agility and learning is one reason he is shown as scribe for 's dictation of the Mahabharata in this interpolation. Richard L. Brown dates the story to the 8th century, and Moriz Winternitz concludes that it was known as early as c. 900, but it was not added to the Mahabharata some 150 years later. Winternitz also notes that a distinctive feature in South Indian manuscripts of the Mahabharata is their omission of this Ganesha legend. The term [...] is found in some recensions of the [...] and [...] that are regarded as interpolations. A reference to [...] ("Creator of Obstacles") in Vanaparva is also believed to be an interpolation and {{does not appear}} in the critical edition.|$|E
2500|$|This {{scheme was}} leaked, then ruined by a decree of the Assembly of 7 November 1789, such that no {{member of the}} Assembly could become a minister. This decree {{destroyed}} any chance {{of the sort of}} harmony between ministers and parliament that existed in England and dashed Mirabeau's hopes. The queen utterly refused to take Mirabeau's counsel saying, [...] "I hope that we shall never sink so low that we shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> aid from Mirabeau.", and La Marck left Paris. However, in April 1790, La Marck was suddenly recalled by the comte de Mercy-Argenteau, the Austrian ambassador to Paris, and became the queen's most trusted political adviser. From this time to Mirabeau's death, he was the bearer of almost daily communications between Mirabeau and the queen. Mirabeau at first attempted to make an alliance with Lafayette, but it was useless, for Lafayette was not a strong man himself.|$|E

6000|$|All, then, that I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for,</b> {{on behalf}} of the {{scientific}} people, if I may venture to speak for more than myself, is that you should put scientific teaching into what statesmen call the condition of [...] "the most favoured nation"; that is to say, that it shall have as large a share of the time given to education as any other principal subject. You may say that that is a very vague statement, because the value of the allotment of time, under those circumstances, depends upon the number of principal subjects. It is x the time, and an unknown quantity of principal subjects dividing that, and science taking shares with the rest. That shows that we cannot deal with this question fully until we have made up our minds as to what the principal subjects of education ought to be.|$|E

60|$|Dr. Lemon’s bright little eyes rested {{more sharply}} on his hostess. “I don’t {{understand}} you and don’t think you understand yourself.” This was not absolutely candid, for he did understand Mrs. Freer {{to a certain}} extent; it has been related that before he asked Lady Barb’s hand of her parents there had been moments when he himself doubted if a flower only to be described as of the social hothouse, that is of aristocratic air, would flourish in American earth. But an intimation from another person that it was beyond his power to pass off his wife—whether she were {{the daughter of a}} peer or of a shoemaker—set all his blood on fire. It quenched on the instant his own perception of difficulties of detail and made him feel only that he was dishonoured—he the heir of all the ages—by such insinuations. It was his belief—though he had never before had occasion to put it forward—that his position, {{one of the best in}} the world, had about it the felicity that makes everything possible. He had had the best education the age could offer, for if he had rather wasted his time at Harvard, where he entered very young, he had, as he believed, been tremendously serious at Heidelberg and at Vienna. He had devoted himself to one of the noblest of professions—a profession recognised as such everywhere but in England—and had inherited a fortune far beyond the expectation of his earlier years, the years when he cultivated habits of work which alone (or rather in combination with talents that he neither exaggerated nor undervalued) would have conduced to distinction. He was one of the most fortunate inhabitants of an immense fresh rich country, a country whose future was admitted to be incalculable, and he moved with perfect ease in a society in which he was not overshadowed by others. It seemed to him, therefore, beneath his dignity to wonder whether he could afford, socially speaking, to marry according to his taste. He pretended to general strength, and what was the use of strength if you weren’t prepared to undertake things timid people might find difficult? It was his plan to marry the woman he desired and not be afraid of her afterward. The effect of Mrs. Freer’s doubt of his success was to represent to him that his own character wouldn’t cover his wife’s; she couldn’t have made him feel worse if she had told him that he was marrying beneath him and would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> indulgence. “I don’t believe you know how much I think that any woman who marries me will be doing very well,” he promptly added.|$|E
