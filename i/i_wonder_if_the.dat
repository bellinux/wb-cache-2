2500|$|... "That {{makes it}} {{particularly}} galling {{of the director}} to put words in my mouth." [...] Le Guin disavowed some specific interpretations both by Lieberman and by executive director Robert Halmi Sr., and concluded (quoting Lieberman): <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> people who made the film of The Lord of the Rings had ended it with Frodo putting on the Ring and ruling happily ever after, and then claimed that that was what Tolkien [...] "intended..." [...] would people think they'd been [...] "very, very honest to the books"? ...|$|E
2500|$|Also, Torata Nanbu, {{leader of}} Tokyo Shock Boys, {{one of the}} people had been {{supporting}} Tashiro {{for the sake of his}} comeback, said sadly [...] "My heart is aching very much. I don't mean to beat him up, but he makes me feel empty inside. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> drug might be more fascinating for him than the feeling of returning to the entertainment industry, [...] " [...] and concluded, [...] "I cannot take any more. Regrettably, this is the end. It is no longer possible for him to restore his reputation." [...] He had been appearing in the radio program named [...] "Tashiro Nakamura　Nanbu Akua-Chan", broadcast in Rainbowtown FM, aimed at supporting Tashiro's comeback, where nobody got paid even once before the programme was cancelled.|$|E

60|$|Not {{only her}} face, but her whole body, gave {{a sense of}} alacrity. <b>I</b> nodded. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> poor devil had been {{hammered}} on the Stock Exchange or run over by an omnibus.|$|R
60|$|But {{the stain}} upon our family {{was a source}} of unpleasantness to us. I fully {{believed}} my father innocent, and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> time would ever come when his character would be cleared.|$|R
60|$|Checco {{rose from}} his seat. He was pale and he almost seemed to hesitate; <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{soldiers}} had had the effect which Girolamo intended. Then he began to speak, quietly, in even, well-turned sentences, so that one could see the speech had been carefully thought out.|$|R
6000|$|Cautiously, [...] "Will dear, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{people here}} don't criticize me sometimes? They must. I mean: {{if they ever}} do, you mustn't let it bother you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sandy (aside). <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{old fool}} reckons I'll pour it out. Well, seein's he's the oldest. (Pours {{chocolate}} awkwardly, and spills {{it on the}} table and DON JOSE.) ...|$|E
60|$|BRIDGET [considering]. I {{think about}} nothing. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> pig is {{fattening}} well, or I {{go out to}} see if the crows are picking up the chickens' food.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} that <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> instantly <b>if</b> <b>the</b> man had followed Mariposilla.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon they won't go foolin' with Clark's boys again," [...] said Polly Ann, {{resuming}} {{a vigorous}} rubbing of the skillet. [...] "Ye was tellin' me about these fine folks ye fetched home." [...] She tossed {{her head in}} the direction of the open door, and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> fine folks were outside.|$|R
5000|$|In {{later years}} Mr Clements said, [...] "Day after day I {{was on my}} knees {{chipping}} away and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> originator of the Commandments suffered from an aching back and sore knees as I did". If you glance at the stones you will find eleven commandments the eleventh inscribed, 'A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another. John 13 v34.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{yet he is}} a Scottish earl's son," [...] said Karlsefin. [...] "It {{does seem}} a hard case to be a thrall. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> new {{religion}} teaches anything regarding thraldom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He has, no doubt, {{complaints}} to make. They always have," [...] he said. [...] "Considering everything, {{that is not}} astonishing. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Headman expects us to give them much consideration." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be dark soon," [...] said Tip, {{observing that}} the sun was low on the horizon. [...] "Perhaps we should have waited until morning. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Gump can fly in the night." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{listened as}} in a spell as Jacob Settle spoke. There was {{something}} {{so far away}} {{in the tone of}} his voice--something so dreamy and mystic in the eyes that looked as if through me at some spirit beyond--something so lofty in his very diction and in such marked contrast to his workworn clothes and his poor surroundings that <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> whole thing were not a dream.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> he's <b>the</b> same. Surely it is impossible! Only a {{schoolmaster}} still! Do {{you know}} his Christian name--is it Richard?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> often <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{reviewer}} who abuses {{you for a}} printer's error realises what pleasure he {{causes the}} wife of your bosom.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wish,' he observed, {{with simple}} pathos, 'that I'd got the Rajah of Seltzerpore here now. I'd {{strangle}} him. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Old Man realizes that he's done his own House {{out of the}} cup?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Landor {{has just}} turned up; but I had read him already. I like him extremely; <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> 'cuts' were perhaps not advantageous. [...] It seems quite full enough; {{but then you}} know I am a compressionist.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shiver very much!" [...] {{said the}} mother. [...] "It's a cold day. Pray shut the window Warner. I see the drops upon the pane; it is raining. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> persons below would lend us one block of coal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There she goes, an' <b>I</b> wouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> alarm {{came from}} some of them big storage warehouses, for Ninety-four is headin' {{straight}} toward them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'This is the {{document}} in question,' he said. 'Those crooked and fantastic characters are terrible. <b>I</b> often <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> writers {{were able to}} read them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, mother, <b>I</b> was <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{time would}} ever come when I {{would be a}} minister, {{and you would have}} an egg for your breakfast every morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Commissioner's wife {{stood in}} the doorway and watched:--"Poor little mite! A blue sash ... and my own {{precious}} Patsie! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> best of us, or we who love them best, ever understand what goes on in their topsy-turvy little heads." ...|$|E
60|$|Not half an {{hour after}} {{throwing}} away his crutch, he leaped a great ditch ten feet wide, and of undiscoverable muddy depth. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> old cripple would think me the lamer one now, thought Israel to himself, arriving on the hither side.|$|E
6000|$|... "I love war! it is a {{diversion}} for kings!" [...] was the answer. [...] "How fine the breast-plates and helmets of those Cuirassiers glisten in the sun!" [...] continued the lady. [...] "Do you see von Sohnspeer? <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Crown Prince be with him!" ...|$|E
40|$|Consequently, <b>I</b> {{began to}} <b>wonder</b> what my view would be {{concerning}} the Lord‘s Day. As I {{began to study}} the Scriptures concerning the Lord‘s Day I became {{more aware of the}} importance of the fourth commandment. I began to present my findings in my teaching and preaching opportunities. I found there was resistance to any observance of the Lord‘s Day in many church members for various reasons. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> church has a proper theological, scriptural and historical understanding of the Lord‘s Day.

6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Marquis were {{to offer}} {{me a better}} living, so that I might be close to him. We are to be the lamb and the wolf sitting down together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's it!" [...] assented Carter, [...] "but I didn't say anything. <b>I</b> only <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{same kind}} of stick hadn't been flung at the owner, that's all. But I suppose you know your {{business}} best, Captain." ...|$|R
6000|$|He stopped again a moment, and {{his face}} had grown hard when he went on: [...] "You see, the thing--is--contagious, and that devil Funnel-paint, or somebody, has played the same trick before. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> man who wrote this looked quite {{as bad as the}} nigger did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, Jim; it's letting up now. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{storm was}} as bad over where the Clayton girls are?" [...] His voice betrayed anxiety greater than he knew. Rivers {{looked at him}} indulgently and smiled at Blanche. [...] "You'd better go and see," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|At length, a cold hand is laid upon my shoulder, and I awake. The wild faces have {{vanished}} and all is silent now, and <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{whole thing has}} been a dream. My father lifts me into the dog-cart, and we drive home through the chill dawn.|$|E
60|$|She was {{carrying}} {{on with her}} remarks, and as I listened I clenched my fists till <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> knuckles didn't stand out white under the strain. It seemed as if she would never get to the nub.|$|R
60|$|I {{leaned against}} the rail {{in the lee of}} the wheel-house, and stared up at the lofty spars and myriad ropes that I could guess were there. No, I decided I was not keen on the voyage. The whole {{atmosphere}} of it was wrong. There were the cold hours I had waited on the pier-ends. There was Miss West coming along. There was the crew of broken men and lunatics. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> wounded Greek in the 'midship house still gibbered, and if Mr. Pike had yet sewed him up; and I was quite sure I would not care to witness such a transaction in surgery.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I heard. And <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Consul-General himself doesn't come {{to hear of}} it. How am I to {{go before}} him to-morrow with that thing on my cheek--I want to know. Its you who ought to have got this!" ...|$|R
