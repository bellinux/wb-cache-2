5|$|Griffith {{remained}} a one-station market, however <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> programming from Prime {{in line with}} the network's other stations, MTN-9 relayed programming mainly from WIN Television in southern New South Wales. A supplementary licence, AMN-31, was successfully bid for by MTN in 1996, providing a relay of Prime Television. Soon after the station was purchased by WIN Television, which undertook a number of minor changes – mainly changing the news service to WIN News, and using entirely WIN branding. AMN-31 remains a relay of Prime. Similarly, the Mildura licence area remained separate from the remainder of Victoria, albeit with a single station, STV-8, later bought out by WIN Television in 1996. In 1997 Prime was successful in bidding for a new licence for the area at a cost of $3.2 million. PTV-31 began broadcasting the following year.|$|E
5|$|His {{research}} and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted {{the government to}} initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship. Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> planned missiles one after another. R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating 388 crores for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive. Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.|$|E
5|$|Jex {{tells the}} Doctor he is remorseful {{for all those}} deaths his work has caused. The townsfolk demand the Doctor turn Jex over, but he reminds them that Isaac's death will be for naught if they do so, and {{has come up with}} a plan from {{learning}} about Jex' society. When the Gunslinger arrives the next day, residents wearing facial markings similar to Jex race through town, confusing the cyborg and allowing Jex to flee to his ship. However, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> off, Jex tells the Doctor he is ready to face justice in the afterlife, and causes the ship to self-destruct.|$|E

5|$|Prem and Nisha vow to {{sacrifice}} {{their love for}} Rajesh and the baby. Moments before the wedding, Nisha asks Prem's dog Tuffy to give Prem the necklace that Pooja had given her, along with a letter. Tuffy exits Nisha's room and <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> the letter to Prem, delivers it to Rajesh. Rajesh reads the letter and realizes that Prem and Nisha love each other. Subsequently, he halts the wedding and confronts both Nisha and Prem. In the end, Nisha and Prem marry each other {{with the consent of}} their families. The film's title Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! appears and then rephrases to Hum Aapke Hain..! (English: I am yours!).|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after taking}} office, Mulkey {{resigned}} the seat effective December 17, 1918, and McNary was then reappointed to the Senate on December 12, 1918, and took office on December 18, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> office in January, when his term {{he was elected}} to would have started. Mulkey resigned in order to give McNary a slight seniority edge over other new members of the Senate. In 1920, former adversary Stanfield defeated incumbent Democrat George Earle Chamberlain for Oregon's other Senate seat, making McNary the state's senior senator. McNary won re-election four times, in 1924, 1930, 1936, and 1942, serving in Washington, D.C., until his death.|$|E

50|$|Fay's {{method is}} a {{generalization}} <b>of</b> BRR. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> simply <b>taking</b> half-size samples, {{we use the}} full sample every time but with unequal weighting: k for units outside the half-sample and 2 &minus; k for units inside it. (BRR is the case k = 0.) The variance estimate is then V/(1 &minus; k)2, where V is the estimate given by the BRR formula above.|$|R

5000|$|Play {{with the}} Teletubbies {{received}} universally negative reviews from critics. GameFAQs gave Play with the Teletubbies only 2 out of 10, criticising the gameplay by saying [...] "the {{only way to}} make it better is to make the tubbies actually respond to fully pressing the analog stick one way to run, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> just <b>taking</b> it as a suggestion to walk slowly", but they praised the graphics and soundtrack.|$|R

25|$|The {{day after}} commissioning, Kormoran sailed to Kiel, {{where she was}} {{provisioned}} for a 12-month voyage.

25|$|Like most team sports, both {{forms of}} rugby are {{vulnerable}} to match fixing, particularly bets involving easily manipulated outcomes, such as conceding penalties and first point scorer. A recent example is a deliberate infringement by Ryan Tandy {{in order for the}} first points scored to be a penalty goal in a 2010 NRL match; the attempt backfired when <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> a shot at goal, a try was scored.|$|E
25|$|This organ allows {{labyrinth}} fish {{to take in}} oxygen {{directly from}} the air, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> it from the water in which they reside through use of gills. The labyrinth organ helps the oxygen in the inhaled air to be absorbed into the bloodstream. As a result, labyrinth fish can survive {{for a short period}} of time out of water, as they can inhale the air around them, provided they stay moist.|$|E

40|$|Many {{traditional}} methods for shape classification use shape matching scores as similarity measures.
