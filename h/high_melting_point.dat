5|$|An earlier major {{application}} of beryllium was in brakes for military airplanes {{because of its}} hardness, <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point,</b> and exceptional ability to dissipate heat. Environmental considerations have led to substitution by other materials.|$|E
5|$|Some {{properties}} of boron have limited its {{use as a}} semiconductor. It has a <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point,</b> single crystals are relatively hard to obtain, and introducing and retaining controlled impurities is difficult.|$|E
5|$|Rhenium has a <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> {{and a low}} vapor {{pressure}} similar to tantalum and tungsten. Therefore, rhenium filaments exhibit a higher stability if the filament is operated not in vacuum, but in oxygen-containing atmosphere. Those filaments are widely used in mass spectrometers, in ion gauges and in photoflash lamps in photography.|$|E
50|$|The {{elements}} {{become less}} reactive and have <b>higher</b> <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> as the atomic number increases. The <b>higher</b> <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> {{are caused by}} stronger London dispersion forces resulting from more electrons.|$|R
50|$|Deep {{cuts are}} {{difficult}} with workpieces with <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> and usually cause a taper.|$|R
50|$|Compared with TNT it {{has only}} 90% of the {{explosive}} power and is less dense with a <b>higher</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R
5|$|The metal {{takes on}} a bluish tinge when exposed to air at room {{temperature}} for extended periods. Despite a <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> in elemental form (2,468°C), it has a lower density than other refractory metals. Furthermore, it is corrosion-resistant, exhibits superconductivity properties, and forms dielectric oxide layers.|$|E
5|$|Yttrium {{has been}} studied as a nodulizer in ductile cast iron, forming the {{graphite}} into compact nodules instead of flakes to increase ductility and fatigue resistance. Having a <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point,</b> yttrium oxide is used in some ceramic and glass to impart shock resistance and low thermal expansion properties. Those same properties make such glass useful in camera lenses.|$|E
5|$|As a metal, {{titanium}} {{is recognized}} for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It {{is a strong}} metal with low density that is quite ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white in color. The relatively <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> (more than 1,650°C or 3,000°F) makes it useful as a refractory metal. It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity.|$|E
5|$|Illipe butter, {{from the}} nuts of the Shorea stenoptera. Similar to cocoa butter, {{but with a}} <b>higher</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point.</b> Used in cosmetics.|$|R
25|$|Boronic acids {{typically}} have <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>points.</b> They {{are prone to}} forming anhydrides by loss of water molecules, typically to give cyclic trimers.|$|R
2500|$|Tungsten was {{discovered}} in 1781 by the Swedish chemist, Carl Wilhelm Scheele. [...] Tungsten has the <b>highest</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> of all metals, at [...]|$|R
5|$|Chromium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Cr and atomic number 24. It {{is the first}} element in group 6. It is a steely-grey, lustrous, hard and brittle metal which takes a high polish, resists tarnishing, and has a <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point.</b> The name of the element {{is derived from the}} Greek word χρῶμα, chrōma, meaning color, because many chromium compounds are intensely colored.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that the vulcanoids would be very rich in {{elements}} with a <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point,</b> such as iron and nickel. They are unlikely to possess a regolith because such fragmented material heats and cools more rapidly, and is affected more strongly by the Yarkovsky effect, than solid rock. Vulcanoids are probably similar to Mercury in colour and albedo, and may contain material {{left over from the}} earliest stages of the Solar System's formation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point,</b> {{hardness}} and {{corrosion resistance}} of iridium and its alloys determine {{most of its}} applications. Iridium and especially iridium–platinum alloys or osmium–iridium alloys have a low wear and are used, for example, for multi-pored spinnerets, through which a plastic polymer melt is extruded to form fibers, such as rayon. Osmium–iridium is used for compass bearings and for balances.|$|E
25|$|Lactic acid is hygroscopic. DL-lactic acid is {{miscible}} {{with water}} and with ethanol above its <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> which is around 17 or 18°C. D-lactic acid and L-lactic acid have a <b>higher</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R
50|$|The dinitrobenzenes are all {{crystalline}} solids. The boiling {{points of}} the three isomers are relatively close; however, the <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> significantly differ. 1,4-Dinitrobenzene, which has the highest symmetry, has the <b>highest</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lactic acid is hygroscopic. DL-lactic acid is {{miscible}} {{with water}} and with ethanol above its <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> which is around 17 or 18 °C. D-lactic acid and L-lactic acid have a <b>higher</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R
5|$|Thorium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Th and atomic number 90. Thorium metal is silvery and tarnishes black {{when it is}} exposed to air, forming the dioxide; it is moderately hard, malleable, and has a <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point.</b> Thorium is an electropositive actinide whose chemistry {{is dominated by the}} +4 oxidation state; it is quite reactive and can ignite in air when finely divided.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium oxide {{is useful}} for many {{applications}} that require the combined properties of an electrical insulator and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point.</b> Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in high-power transistors in radio frequency transmitters for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets. Beryllium compounds were used in fluorescent lighting tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease berylliosis which developed in the workers who were making the tubes.|$|E
5|$|Electrolysis of {{a mixture}} of {{beryllium}} fluoride and sodium fluoride was used to isolate beryllium during the 19th century. The metal's <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> makes this process more energy-consuming than corresponding processes used for the alkali metals. Early in the 20th century, the production of beryllium by the thermal decomposition of beryllium iodide was investigated following {{the success of a}} similar process for the production of zirconium, but this process proved to be uneconomical for volume production.|$|E
50|$|Thus, trans alkenes, {{which are}} less polar and more symmetrical, have lower boiling <b>points</b> and <b>higher</b> <b>melting</b> <b>points,</b> and cis alkenes, which are {{generally}} more polar and less symmetrical, have higher boiling <b>points</b> and lower <b>melting</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{a general}} trend, trans alkenes {{tend to have}} <b>higher</b> <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> and lower {{solubility}} in inert solvents, as trans alkenes, in general, are more symmetrical than cis alkenes.|$|R
50|$|The non-copper goldstones {{are easier}} to work with when reheated, due to the less {{stringent}} reduction requirements and <b>higher</b> <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> of manganese (1246 °C) and cobalt (1495 °C).|$|R
5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} {{has been observed}} only {{for the first three}} members of the group. The chemistry of rutherfordium is not very established and therefore the rest of the section deals only with titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. All the elements of the group are reactive metals with a <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> (1668°C, 1855°C, 2233°C, 2100°C?). The reactivity is not always obvious due to the rapid formation of a stable oxide layer, which prevents further reactions. The oxides TiO2, ZrO2 and HfO2 are white solids with high melting points and unreactive against most acids.|$|E
5|$|Of all {{metals in}} pure form, {{tungsten}} {{has the highest}} melting point (3422°C, 6192°F), lowest vapor pressure (at temperatures above 1650°C, 3000°F), and the highest tensile strength. Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten, carbon sublimes at atmospheric pressure instead of melting, so it has no melting point. Tungsten has the lowest {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of any pure metal. The low thermal expansion and <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> and tensile strength of tungsten originate from strong covalent bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is dark (blue-gray), dense, ductile, very hard, easily fabricated, {{and highly}} {{conductive}} {{of heat and}} electricity. The metal is renowned for its resistance to corrosion by acids; in fact, at temperatures below 150°C tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive aqua regia. It can be dissolved with hydrofluoric acid or acidic solutions containing the fluoride ion and sulfur trioxide, {{as well as with}} a solution of potassium hydroxide. Tantalum's <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> of 3017°C (boiling point 5458°C) is exceeded among the elements only by tungsten, rhenium and osmium for metals, and carbon.|$|E
50|$|Friedrich Reinitzer, an Austrian Botanist, {{found in}} 1888 {{that there were}} two {{separate}} <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> in Chloresteryl Benzoate. It melted into a cloudy state which was recorded at 145.5°C, and then again into a clear liquid at the <b>higher</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> of 178.5°C.|$|R
50|$|The {{surface of}} lead bullets fired at <b>high</b> {{velocity}} may <b>melt</b> due to hot gases behind and friction with the bore. Because copper has a <b>higher</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point,</b> and greater {{specific heat capacity}} and hardness, copper-jacketed bullets allow greater muzzle velocities.|$|R
50|$|The isomers {{differ in}} the {{location}} of the chlorine, but have the same chemical formula. All have very similar boiling points, although p-chlorotoluene has a much <b>higher</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> due to a more tightly-packed crystal structure.|$|R
5|$|Curium is a hard, dense, silvery metal with a {{relatively}} <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> and boiling point for an actinide. Whereas it is paramagnetic at ambient conditions, it becomes antiferromagnetic upon cooling, and other magnetic transitions are also observed for many curium compounds. In compounds, curium usually exhibits valence +3 and sometimes +4, and the +3 valence is predominant in solutions. Curium readily oxidizes, and its oxides are a dominant form of this element. It forms strongly fluorescent complexes with various organic compounds, {{but there is no}} evidence of its incorporation into bacteria and archaea. When introduced into the human body, curium accumulates in the bones, lungs and liver, where it promotes cancer.|$|E
5|$|Polymers {{exhibit the}} same {{stability}} increases afforded by fluorine substitution (for hydrogen) in discrete molecules; their melting points generally increase too. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the simplest fluoropolymer and perfluoro analogue of polyethylene with structural unit , demonstrates this change as expected, but its very <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> {{makes it difficult}} to mold. Various PTFE derivatives are less temperature-tolerant but easier to mold: fluorinated ethylene propylene replaces some fluorine atoms with trifluoromethyl groups, perfluoroalkoxy alkanes do the same with trifluoromethoxy groups, and Nafion contains perfluoroether side chains capped with sulfonic acid groups. Other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms; polyvinylidene fluoride has half the fluorine atoms of PTFE and polyvinyl fluoride has a quarter, but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium finds use in {{jewelry and}} for decorations. It is {{electroplated}} on white gold and platinum {{to give it}} a reflective white surface at time of sale, after which the thin layer wears away with use. This is known as rhodium flashing in the jewelry business. It may also be used in coating sterling silver to protect against tarnish (silver sulfide, Ag2S, produced from atmospheric hydrogen sulfide, H2S). Solid (pure) rhodium jewelry is very rare, more because of the difficulty of fabrication (<b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> and poor malleability) than because of the high price. The high cost ensures that rhodium is applied only as an electroplate.|$|E
50|$|Binary {{compounds}} such as {{tungsten carbide}} or boron nitride {{can be very}} refractory. Hafnium carbide is the most refractory binary compound known, with a <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> of 3890 °C. The ternary compound tantalum hafnium carbide {{has one of the}} <b>highest</b> <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> of all known compounds (4215 °C).|$|R
50|$|The half-ounce of pearly, lustrous mass {{obtained}} became DuPont's nylon. The fibers formed were elastic {{and strong}} after cold drawing and were both unaffected by water or most solvents {{and had a}} <b>higher</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> than previous fibers.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a general}} trend of {{increasing}} Vickers hardness, Brinell hardness, density and <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> from lanthanum to lutetium (with europium and ytterbium being the most notable exceptions; in the metallic state, they are divalent rather than trivalent). Lutetium is the hardest and densest lanthanide and has the <b>highest</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R
