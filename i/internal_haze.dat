40|$|To {{improve the}} {{transparency}} of isotactic polypropylene sheets, multilayer extrusion was conducted using a resin with lower melt viscosity for the surface layers than {{one for the}} core layer. By using multilayer extrusion, the number of spherulites near the surface decreased dramatically and the <b>internal</b> <b>haze</b> of the sheet was improved. The number of spherulites of the sheet cross-section and the <b>internal</b> <b>haze</b> were closely correlated to each other. Each distribution on the flow velocity, shear rate and shear stress in a die lip section was calculated using a finite element method. The shear stress in the sheet thickness direction was reduced when the resin with lower melt viscosity was laminated on both surfaces, {{and then it was}} surmised that the stress induced crystallization was considerably restrained in these layers. Furthermore, the cooling simulation in a belt quenching process was conducted, and the prediction formula was derived by multiple regression analysis, using the number density of spherulites as a response variable, and both the plateau area time of the temperature in each thickness direction and shear stress as independent variables, respectively. As a result, the number density of spherulites in various surface layer ratios was predicted using obtained regression formula, and the optimization of the multilayer composition to obtain higher transparency was proposed...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} results concerning the atmospheres {{of the outer}} planets and satellites are presented, covering Pluto, Triton, Neptune, Uranus, Titan, Saturn, and Io. In addition to presenting analyses of physical properties and atmospheric chemical composition, attention is given to (1) the origin of Pluto; (2) the possible variability of Triton; (3) the rotation periods of Uranus and Neptune, {{as well as their}} effective temperatures and <b>internal</b> heating, <b>haze</b> distribution, thermal structure, and weather and seasonal changes; (4) the seasonal and long-term changes of Titan, in addition to its thermal structure; (5) the dust and haze distribution of Saturn; and (6) Io's gaseous plasma and neutral torio. The data include Voyager 1 and 2 results for Io, along with Pioneer 11 results for Saturn and Titan...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{apparent}} {{direction of}} rotation of perceptually bistable wire-frame (Necker) cubes can be conditioned to depend on retinal location by interleaving their presentation with cubes that are disambiguated by depth cues (Haijiang, Saunders, Stone, & Backus, 2006; Harrison & Backus, 2010 a). The long-term nature of the learned bias is demonstrated by resistance to counter-conditioning on a consecutive day. In previous work, either binocular disparity and occlusion, {{or a combination of}} monocular depth cues that included occlusion, <b>internal</b> occlusion, <b>haze,</b> and depth-from-shading, were used to control the rotation direction of disambiguated cubes. Here, we test the relative effectiveness of these two sets of depth cues in establishing the retinal location bias. Both cue sets were highly effective in establishing a perceptual bias on Day 1 as measured by the perceived rotation direction of ambiguous cubes. The effect of counter-conditioning on Day 2, on perceptual outcome for ambiguous cubes, was independent of whether the cue set was the same or different as Day 1. This invariance suggests that a common neural population instantiates the bias for rotation direction, regardless of the cue set used. However, in a further experiment where only disambiguated cubes were presented on Day 1, perceptual outcome of ambiguous cubes during Day 2 counter-conditioning showed that the monocular-only cue set was in fact more effective than disparity-plus-occlusion for causing long-term learning of the bias. These results can be reconciled if the conditioning effect of Day 1 ambiguous trials in the first experiment is taken into account (Harrison & Backus, 2010 b). We suggest that monocular disambiguation leads to stronger bias either because it more strongly activates a single neural population that is necessary for perceiving rotation, or because ambiguous stimuli engage cortical areas that are also engaged by monocularly disambiguated stimuli but not by disparity-disambiguated stimuli...|$|R
