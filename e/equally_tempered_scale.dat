50|$|<b>Equally</b> <b>tempered</b> <b>scales</b> {{have been}} used and {{instruments}} built using various other numbers of equal intervals. The 19 equal temperament, first proposed and used by Guillaume Costeley in the 16th century, uses 19 equally spaced tones, offering better major thirds and far better minor thirds than normal 12-semitone equal temperament {{at the cost of}} a flatter fifth. The overall effect is one of greater consonance. 24 equal temperament, with 24 equally spaced tones, is widespread in the pedagogy and notation of Arabic music.

5000|$|Because of {{the strong}} {{influence}} of Western European music, present-day performers of Georgian folk music often employ Western tuning, bringing the seconds, fourths, sixths, and sevenths, and sometimes the thirds as well, closer to the standard <b>equally</b> <b>tempered</b> <b>scale.</b> This process started {{from the very first}} professional choir, organized in Georgia in 1886 (so called [...] "Agniahsvili choro").

5000|$|The term [...] "guitar intonation" [...] denotes to what {{precision}} {{the ideal}} <b>equally</b> <b>tempered</b> musical <b>scale</b> {{can be produced}} by a guitar, while [...] "piano intonation" [...] refers to the setup procedure of the individual hammers in the piano keyboard.

On the contrary the [...] "level" [...] zero fret will have no pitch errors on the fingered notes. This can be demonstrated by measuring the pitch deviation of each single note on the fingerboard. Players who frequently use the lower frets from 0 to 5 will benefit most from a zero fret. Using mainly the upper range of the fingerboard neutralizes the advantage of the zero fret and conventional nuts are equally suited. Those players usually avoid playing first and second fret positions because of the pitch problems there. For beginners a zero fretted guitar is preferable.|$|R

40|$|This thesis draws a {{distinction}} between the nature of intonation and tuning in tonal and atonal music. I describe the musical aesthetic of the Second Viennese School as conditioned by and born out of equal temperament. In contrast, tonal music often employs intonation that varies from equal temperament significantly. These contrasting notions are explored through an examination of two historically opposed ideologies that concern consonance and dissonance. This thesis suggests that the aesthetic evaluation of twelve-tone atonal music may be informed by its theoretical limitation to the <b>equally</b> <b>tempered</b> <b>scale.</b> It is dissonance within discordance, referring to a preponderance of dissonant harmony within a dissonant medium of tuning. Supplementary audio files are included to support this thesis. Examples 1 - 9 compare various chords and progressions in just intonation and equal temperament. Example 10 is a midi version of "Yesterday I Heard the Rain," arranged by Brent Graham, in equal temperament...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{correlations among}} pitches in several songs {{and pieces of}} piano music by mapping them to one-dimensional walks. Two kinds of correlations are studied, one {{is related to the}} real values of frequencies while they are treated only as different symbols for another. Long-range power law behavior is found in both kinds. The first is more meaningful. The structure of music, such as beat, measure and stanza, are reflected in the change of scaling exponents. Some interesting features are observed. Our results demonstrate the viewpoint that the fundamental principle of music is the balance between repetition and contrast. The aesthetic sense and perception remains a mystery in scientific level. One may expect that its mechanism should be dependent on the structure, especially a kind of collective effect of information possessed by the artistic or natural beauty and then the sensory processing of this information. The quantitative nature of most elements of music make analysis using methods of statistical physics feasible. 1 /f noise was discovered in an earlier measurement of loudness fluctuations in music 1.

50|$|Dividing the tritave into 13 equal steps tempers out, or reduces to a unison, {{both of the}} {{intervals}} 245/243 (about 14 cents, sometimes called the minor Bohlen-Pierce diesis) and 3125/3087 (about 21 cents, sometimes called the major Bohlen-Pierce diesis) {{in the same way}} that dividing the octave into 12 equal steps reduces both 81/80 (syntonic comma) and 128/125 (5-limit limma) to a unison. A 7-limit linear temperament tempers out both of these intervals; the resulting Bohlen-Pierce temperament no longer has anything to do with tritave equivalences or non-octave scales, beyond the fact that it is well adapted to using them. A tuning of 41 equal steps to the octave (1200/41 = 29.27 cents per step) would be quite logical for this temperament. In such a tuning, a tempered perfect twelfth (1902.4 cents, about a half cent larger than a just twelfth) is divided into 65 equal steps, resulting in a seeming paradox: Taking every fifth degree of this octave-based scale yields an excellent approximation to the non-octave-based <b>equally</b> <b>tempered</b> BP <b>scale.</b> Furthermore, an interval of five such steps generates (octave-based) MOSes with 8, 9, or 17 notes, and the 8-note scale (comprising degrees 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 of the 41-equal scale) could be considered the octave-equivalent version of the Bohlen-Pierce scale.|$|R
