5|$|Argon is a {{chemical}} element with symbolAr and atomic number18. It is in group 18 of {{the periodic table}} and is a noble gas. Argon is the third-most abundant <b>gas</b> <b>in</b> the Earth's atmosphere, at 0.934% (9340 ppmv). It {{is more than twice}} as abundant as water vapor (which averages about 4000 ppmv, but varies greatly), 23 times as abundant as carbon dioxide (400 ppmv), and more than 500 times as abundant as neon (18 ppmv). Argon is the most abundant noble <b>gas</b> <b>in</b> Earth's crust, comprising 0.00015% of the crust.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen sponge alloys {{can contain}} lanthanum. These alloys {{are capable of}} storing up to 400 times their own volume of {{hydrogen}} <b>gas</b> <b>in</b> a reversible adsorption process. Heat energy is released every time they do so; therefore these alloys have possibilities in energy conservation systems.|$|E
5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the inert <b>gas</b> <b>in</b> the breathing gas is reduced below that {{of any of the}} tissues, there is a tendency for gas to return from the tissues to the breathing gas. This is known as out-gassing, and occurs during decompression, when the reduction in ambient pressure reduces the partial pressure of the inert <b>gas</b> <b>in</b> the lungs. This process may be complicated by the formation of gas bubbles, and the modeling is more complex and varied.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} the {{solubilities}} of <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> liquids and liquids in liquids were modeled using both physical properties and topological descriptors of the solutes. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods were employed to create single-linear regression (SLR) and multiple-linear regression (MLR) models of the solubilities. Factor analysis was employed {{to determine the number}} of significant factors present in the solubilities. The solubilities of monoalcohols in water, halogenated alkanes <b>in</b> water, <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> water, <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> alkanes, and <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> alcohols were examined and modeled...|$|R

5|$|The {{absorption}} of gases in liquids {{depends on the}} solubility of the specific <b>gas</b> <b>in</b> the specific liquid, the concentration of gas, customarily expressed as partial pressure, and temperature. The main variable {{in the study of}} decompression theory is pressure.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{calculate}} some exact solutions {{of the grand}} partition functions for quantum <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> confined space, such as ideal <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> two- and three-dimensional boxes, in tubes, in annular containers, on the lateral surface of cylinders, and photon <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> three-dimensional boxes. Based on these exact solutions, which, of course, contain the complete information about the system, we discuss the geometry effect which is neglected in the calculation with the thermodynamic limit V→∞, and analyze {{the validity of the}} quantum statistical method which can be used to calculate the geometry effect on ideal quantum <b>gases</b> confined <b>in</b> two-dimensional irregular containers. We also calculate the grand partition function for phonon <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> confined space. Finally, we discuss the geometry effects in realistic systems.

40|$|The {{solubility}} of <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> liquids {{has been}} under quantitative investigation {{since the beginning of}} the nineteenth century. The last decade has seen some remarkable advances in theory, empirical correlations, systems studied, and apparatus. Much of the earlier work was more qualitative than quantitative. Gas solubilities have become increasingly more important for both the theoretical understanding of the liquid state and solutions, and for practical applications from the solubility of <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> human tissues to the solubility of <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> molten salts and metals...|$|R

The proposed equation represents satisfactorily the solubility coefficients of the hydrocarbon <b>gases</b> <b>in</b> glassy PVTMS {{as a function}} of the fractal dimension of the polymer and the effective diameter of a gas penetrant molecule. It is found that the calculated solubility coefficients have a good correlation with the experimental data.

5|$|The {{specificity}} of RSTs {{for the presence}} of GAS is at least 95%, with some studies finding close to 100% specificity. Therefore, if the test result is positive, the presence of GAS is highly likely. However, 5% to 20% of individuals carry <b>GAS</b> <b>in</b> their throats without symptomatic infection, so the presence of <b>GAS</b> <b>in</b> an individual with pharyngitis does not prove that this organism is responsible for the infection. The sensitivity of lateral flow RSTs is somewhat lower at 65% to 80%. Therefore, a negative result from such a test cannot be used to rule out GAS pharyngitis, a considerable disadvantage compared with microbial culture, which has a sensitivity of 90% to 95%. However, newer optical immunoassay RSTs have been found to have a much higher sensitivity of 94%.|$|E

5|$|A lattice gas {{automaton}} is {{a cellular}} automaton designed {{to simulate the}} motion of particles in a fluid or an ideal <b>gas.</b> <b>In</b> such a system, gas particles move on straight lines with constant velocity, until undergoing elastic collision with other particles. Lattice gas automata simplify these models by only allowing a constant number of velocities (typically, only one speed and either four or six directions of motion) and by simplifying the types of collision that are possible.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the layer}} of {{metallic}} hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.2858 MPa and critical temperature of only 32.938K. In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases—hydrogen {{is said to be}} in a supercritical fluid state. It is convenient to treat hydrogen as <b>gas</b> <b>in</b> the upper layer extending downward from the cloud layer to a depth of about 1,000km, and as liquid in deeper layers. Physically, there is no clear boundary—the gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{extraction}} process, using low-temperature gas liquefaction, was not developed {{in time to}} be significant during World War I, production continued. Helium was primarily used as a lifting <b>gas</b> <b>in</b> lighter-than-air craft. During World War II, the demand increased for helium for lifting gas and for shielded arc welding. The helium mass spectrometer was also vital in the atomic bomb Manhattan Project.|$|E

5|$|An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The galaxy may be {{the same}} size as the Milky Way but has a visible star count of only 1% of the Milky Way.

5|$|Any dive {{which is}} started while the tissues retain {{residual}} inert <b>gas</b> <b>in</b> {{excess of the}} surface equilibrium condition is considered a repetitive dive. This means that the decompression required for the dive {{is influenced by the}} divers decompression history. Allowance must be made for inert gas preloading of the tissues which will result in them containing more dissolved gas than would have been the case if the diver had fully equilibrated before the dive. The diver will need to decompress longer to eliminate this increased gas loading.|$|E
5|$|Argon is {{produced}} industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Argon is mostly {{used as an}} inert shielding <b>gas</b> <b>in</b> welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily unreactive substances become reactive; for example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. Argon is also used in incandescent, fluorescent lighting, and other gas-discharge tubes. Argon makes a distinctive blue-green gas laser. Argon is also used in fluorescent glow starters.|$|E

Argon gas is also commonly used for sputter deposition of thin films as in microelectronics and for wafer cleaning in microfabrication.|$|E

5|$|Charging {{an empty}} dive {{cylinder}} also causes a temperature rise as the gas inside the cylinder is compressed by the inflow of higher pressure gas, though this temperature rise may initially be tempered because compressed gas from a storage bank {{at room temperature}} decreases in temperature when it decreases in pressure, so at first the empty cylinder is charged with cold gas, but {{the temperature of the}} <b>gas</b> <b>in</b> the cylinder then increases to above ambient as the cylinder fills to the working pressure.|$|E
