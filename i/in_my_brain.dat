Gaga told Access Hollywood about the shoot at Hearst Castle and the main idea behind the video: [...] "It was a great experience writing the treatment working with everyone and I was like, 'Don't touch anything, and if you knock over a sculpture I'm going to pass out!'. The intention of the video was to create something that was a true sort of road map of my journey, being an artist, a pop singer, a creative person..... It's interesting because in this video the fashion and the psychotic sort of whimsy is all happening around me and it's me almost like Alice in Wonderland going through my own rabbit hole <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> and re-experiencing the past year of my life. Every moment that we were filming together was really joyous and really fun." ...|$|E
500|$|After some {{errors in}} her {{pronunciation}} of Sanskrit shloka [...] "Yoga Taravali" [...] during the song [...] "Shanti/Ashtangi", the BBC arranged for Madonna to take telephonic lessons {{to learn the}} basic correct pronunciation of Sanskrit words from eminent scholar Dr B P T Vagish Shastri. She then made the necessary pronunciation corrections on the album. In an interview with MTV, Madonna recalled the recording of the album, and said her business partner Guy Oseary was a helpful friend, and that after she and Orbit played him the tracks, he, to their dismay, said nothing and left the studio. [...] "He really hates those icy strings. Right when I think the track's done, he sort of pushes us another step further. 'Maybe we should try this', or 'I really don't want to hear that'. And then of course, later on, it creeps <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>brain,</b> and I'm like, 'maybe I should have done a background vocal on that'. And then she comes in and happily does it, right?", Madonna said. Orbit also recalled during an interview with Q magazine that Madonna recorded [...] "Swim" [...] the day her friend and fashion designer Gianni Versace was killed in Miami, Florida. He also commented that this is probably why the track has an emotional impact.|$|E
2500|$|Discussing the {{influences}} behind the album and performances, Perri listed [...] "love" [...] as the album's major inspiration. She added that {{she tried not}} to listen to any other music other her current projects to stay inspired and not get distracted. She continued, [...] "Because I write with piano or guitar, I would come in with vocals and one instrument and we'd start from the ground up and add things." [...] Additional influences of the album include Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, James Taylor, Elton John, and The Beatles. Perri [...] "mushed it all together <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> and made Lovestrong." ...|$|E

About a month ago I suddenly found myself in the right frame of mind for doing philosophy. I had been absolutely certain that I'd never again {{be able to do}} it. It's the first time after more than 2 years that the curtain <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> has gone up.—Of course, so far I've only worked for about 5 weeks & it may be all over by tomorrow; but it bucks me up a lot now." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Clark hit a rich vein for his {{flamboyant}} clothing range. The fashion press dubbed Ossie the [...] "King of King's Road". Clark pronounced himself a [...] "master cutter. It's all <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> and fingers and there's no-one {{in the world}} to touch me. I can do everything myself." [...] Clark's great idol was the famous dancer Nijinsky and his love of dance inspired his clothes to be free moving and not to restrict the female form. This style of dressing became quite popular in the 1970s {{thanks in large part to}} the popularity of Clark's clothing. Ossie Clark is well known for his use of muted colours and moss crepe fabric. He also designed shoes, paper dresses, and snakeskin jackets.|$|E
2500|$|When Thomas Middleton gave Coleridge an {{edition of}} William Lisle Bowles's Sonnets, he was {{inspired}} by the poems and even wrote a sonnet to Bowles in praise of the poems' language in 1794. Other poets, including William Cowper and his conversational poem, The Task (1785), also served as an influence in terms of how to compose diction within poetry. Coleridge explained his feelings about those that influenced him in a letter to John Thelwall written on 17 December 1796, [...] "But do not let us introduce an act of Uniformity against Poets— I have room enough <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> to admire, aye & almost equally, the head and fancy of Akenside, and the heart and fancy of Bowles, the solemn Lordliness of Milton, & the divine chit chat of Cowper." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "After a night {{spent in}} fever and sleeplessness, I {{forced myself to}} take a long tramp the next day through the hilly country, which was covered with pine woods. It all looked dreary and desolate, and I could not think what I should do there. Returning in the afternoon, I {{stretched}} myself, dead tired, on a hard couch, awaiting the long-desired hour of sleep. It did not come; but I fell into a kind of somnolent state, in which I suddenly felt as though I were sinking in swiftly flowing water. The rushing sound formed itself <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>brain</b> into a musical sound, the chord of E flat; major, which continually re-echoed in broken forms; these broken chords seemed to be melodic passages of increasing motion, yet the pure triad of E flat; major never changed, but seemed by its continuance to impart infinite significance to the element in which I was sinking. I awoke in sudden terror from my doze, feeling as though the waves were rushing high above my head. I at once recognised that the orchestral overture to the Rheingold, which must long have lain latent within me, though it had been unable to find definite form, had at last been revealed to me."

2500|$|Other {{moments in}} the series suggest that other Time Lords have {{more control over their}} {{regeneration}} than that usually displayed by the Doctor. Prior to regenerating in the episode [...] "Utopia", the Master expresses a desire to be [...] "young and strong" [...] like the Doctor and transforms accordingly. Subsequently, in [...] "Last of the Time Lords", the Master is shot by Lucy Saxon and is able to prevent regeneration at will, despite the Doctor's pleas. In [...] "The Stolen Earth," [...] the Doctor begins to regenerate in a cliffhanger moment, but at the start of [...] "Journey's End" [...] (the following episode), he interrupts the process after healing his bodily injuries, redirecting the remaining regeneration energy into his preserved hand. In [...] "Let's Kill Hitler", when Mels begins to regenerate into River Song, she says she is trying to concentrate so she can come out a particular dress size. In [...] "Nightmare in Silver", the Eleventh Doctor suggests that he can trigger regeneration voluntarily, using the suggestion to threaten the Cyber-Planner invading his body and mind, saying [...] "I could regenerate now. Big blast of regeneration energy, burn out any little Cyber widgets <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>brain,</b> along with everything you're connected to. Don't want to. Use this me up, who knows what we'll get next? But I can." [...] (Even though by The Time Of The Doctor this was revealed to be a bluff {{due to the fact that}} the Eleventh Doctor was actually the final incarnation of his first regeneration cycle.) In [...] "The Girl Who Died, the Twelfth Doctor speculates that he deliberately, if not subconsciously, chose the form of Caecilius (from [...] "The Fires of Pompeii") to remind himself that he is a man who always saves people, even if it is just one. In [...] "The Doctor Falls", the Doctor is wounded by Cybermen and starts to regenerate, but is able to hold back his regeneration, refusing to change again.|$|E
