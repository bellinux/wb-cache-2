5000|$|The {{calibration}} of magnetometers {{is usually}} performed {{by means of}} coils which are supplied by an electrical current to create a magnetic field. It allows to characterize {{the sensitivity of the}} magnetometer (in terms of V/T). In many applications the homogeneity of the calibration coil is an important feature. For this reason, coils like Helmholtz coils is commonly used either in a single axis or a three axis configuration.

50|$|Some multigene {{families}} are extremely homogenous, with individual genes members sharing identical or almost identical sequences. The {{process by which}} gene families maintain <b>high</b> <b>homogeneity</b> is Concerted evolution. Concerted evolution occurs through repeated cycles of unequal crossing over events and repeated cycles of gene transfer and conversion. Unequal crossing over leads to the expansion and contraction of gene families. Gene families have an optimal size range that natural selection acts towards. Contraction deletes divergent gene copies and keeps gene families from becoming too large. Expansion replaces lost gene copies and prevents gene families from becoming too small. Repeat cycles of gene transfer and conversion increasingly make gene family members more similar.|$|E
5000|$|Using these {{assumptions}} the sphere multiplier can be calculated. This number {{is the average}} number of times a photon is scattered in the sphere, before it is absorbed in the coating or escapes through a port. This number increases with the reflectivity of the sphere coating and decreases with the ratio between the total area of ports and other absorbing objects and the sphere inner area. To get a <b>high</b> <b>homogeneity</b> a recommended sphere multiplier is 10-25.The theory further states that if the above criteria are fulfilled then the irradiance on any area element on the sphere will be proportional to the total radiant flux input to the sphere. Absolute measurements of instance luminous flux can then be done by measuring a known light source and determining the transfer function or calibration curve.It allows for measurements to be made while the sample undergoes heating, chemical change, or some other external stimulus.|$|E
50|$|The sea {{provides}} {{a significant part}} of the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) - a cold water mass that flows at great depth along the western edge of the North Atlantic, spreading out to form the largest identifiable water mass in the World Ocean. The NADW consists of three parts of different origin and salinity, and the top one, the Labrador Sea Water (LSW), is formed in the Labrador Sea. This part occurs at a medium depth and has a relatively low salinity (34.84-34.89 parts per thousand), low temperature (3.3 - 3.4 C) and high oxygen content compared to the layers above and below it. LSW also has a relatively low vorticity, i.e. the tendency to form vortices, than any other water in North Atlantic that reflects its <b>high</b> <b>homogeneity.</b> It has a potential density of 27.76-27.78 mg/cm3 relatively to the surface layers, meaning it is denser, and thus sinks under the surface and remains homogeneous and unaffected by the surface fluctuations.|$|E

50|$|They {{are used}} as model systems for higher plants because of their {{relatively}} <b>high</b> <b>homogeneity</b> and high growth rate, featuring still general behaviour of plant cell. The diversity of cell types within any part of a naturally grown plant (in vivo) makes {{it very difficult to}} investigate and understand some general biochemical phenomena of living plant cells. The transport of a solute in or out of the cell, for example, is difficult to study because the specialized cells in a multicellular organism behave differently. Cell suspension cultures such as tobacco BY-2 provide good model systems for these studies at the level of a single cell and its compartments because tobacco BY-2 cells behave very similarly to one another. The influence of neighbouring cells behavior is in the suspension is not as important as it would be in an intact plant. As a result any changes observed after a stimulus is applied can be statistically correlated and it could be decided if these changes are reactions to the stimulus or just merely coincidental. In this moment BY-2 cells are relatively well understood and often used in research. This model plant system is especially useful for studies of cell division, cytoskeletons, plant hormone signaling, intracellular trafficking, and organelle differentiation.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{presents}} {{a series of}} experiments on classification of remotely sensed images, to investigate the effective-ness of various combinations {{of different types of}} feature sets, including spectral features, variance features and wavelet-based features. All the experiments use the identical study area, training data, reference data, testing data, and classification algorithm while varying the feature sets. The classification accuracy from different feature sets is evaluated using the traditional accuracy assessment from reference data. The experimental results show that the spectral-based feature set has the basic discrimination power to distinguish classes with middle and <b>high</b> <b>homogeneity</b> value. However, it has little success in correctly classifying classes with low homogeneity value, such as the residential class. Compared with spectral features, the multi-scale wavelet-based feature set can improve the discrimination power for classes with both low and <b>high</b> <b>homogeneity</b> value. The variance-based feature set alone has little discrimina-tion power, no matter what homogeneity level the class has. However, adding the variance features into the spectral feature or wave-let-based feature set can dramatically increase the classification accuracy for classes with low homogeneity value...|$|E
30|$|The {{mechanical}} advantage {{given by the}} redistribution of aeration instead is probably related to other phenomena, since {{the total number of}} lung units open to aeration (i.e. the dimensions of the lung open to aeration) does not change. These might be an increase in the radius of the alveoli open to aeration, which lowers the elastance of each alveolus, and a <b>higher</b> <b>homogeneity</b> in the distribution of aeration (see Fig.Â  2), which through interdependence affects the elastance of higher radius alveoli close to lower radius alveoli.|$|R
40|$|In extra-corporal {{treatment}} of liver cancer by BNCT, it is desired {{to have an}} as homogeneous as possible thermal neutron field throughout the organ. Previous work has shown that when using an epithermal neutron beam, {{the shape of the}} holder in which the liver is placed is the critical factor. This study develops the notion further as to what is the optimum neutron spectrum to perform such treatments. In the design calculations, when using Monte Carlo techniques, it is shown that when the expected contributions of the source neutrons in every part of the liver is calculated, a linear optimization scheme such as the Simplex method results in a mix of thermal and epithermal source neutrons to get the <b>highest</b> <b>homogeneity</b> for the thermal neutron field. This optimisation method is demonstrated in 3 holder shapes: cuboid, cylindrical and spherical with each 3 volumes of 2, 4 and 6 litres. A 10 cm thick cuboid model, irradiated from both sides gives the <b>highest</b> <b>homogeneity.</b> The spherical (rotating) holder has the lowest <b>homogeneity</b> but the <b>highest</b> contribution of every source neutron to the thermal neutrons in the liver.
