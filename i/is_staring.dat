25|$|The {{painting}} {{is divided into}} three principal spaces. Musicians occupy the lower left section, one of whom is centrally located, his back turned toward the viewer, with his double-bass erected to the left. A row of dancers, two women and two men with their legs raised, occupy the upper right. They are characterized by curves and rhythmic repetition, creating a synthetic sense of dynamical movement. The background consists of ornate cabaret-style lighting fixtures, and a few members of the audience sitting in the front row, their eyes fixed on the performance. On the lower right another client <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> with a sidelong glance, indicative of sexual desire or sly and malicious intent; the archetype of a male voyeur, often portrayed in mid-century journalistic illustrations of the can-can.|$|E
500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a {{slightly}} negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Despite noting, [...] "after episodes about butt-crawling and vomiting, it's {{a relief to}} have one in which people die when their skin and muscles are fried away by microscopic sea creatures called medusas", Vitaris was critical of the plot, likening it to [...] "cliche" [...] 1970's movies that featured the [...] "obstreperous official insisting the plane must fly or the skyscraper is fire-proof, even when the potential for catastrophe <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> him in the face." [...] Spotnitz later admitted during a Reddit IAmA that the episode was his least-favorite that he had written because [...] "the concept just wasn't clear or compelling enough to sustain the hour." ...|$|E
500|$|Again {{and again}} in her writings, speeches and interviews, Ursula Franklin insists that war and its {{violence}} are not only morally wrong, but also ineffective, impractical, and costly. During a radio interview broadcast {{two days after the}} September 11 attacks in the U.S., Franklin argued that violence nowadays is always unsuccessful even for the powerful who try to use it. [...] "Nothing has been resolved by violence over the past fifty years," [...] Franklin said. [...] "The rational thinking that force does not work, even for the enforcer, <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> us in the face." [...] In a newspaper article published just before the first anniversary of 9/11, Franklin wrote, [...] "It is crucial to recognize that war and war measures are fundamentally dysfunctional instruments of problem-solving. Violence begets more violence, war begets further wars, more enemies and more suffering." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by March 10, 2008 and was done {{alongside}} [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] and [...] "Cabin Fever". [...] Shooting began by March 24, alongside filming of the previous episode and continued through April 4. [...] The flashforwards were written partially to explain what led Jack to become the drug addict {{that he is in}} third-season finale's flashforwards, who believes that his father is alive. [...] Matthew Fox stated that the fourth season is [...] "starting to close the loop on the end of [...] season. [...] Jack in the future is a man marked by weakness, but the Jack [...] is strong. [...] how he made that transition." [...] When asked why Hurley does not take drugs to see Charlie, but Jack starts his drug addiction to try not to see Christian, Edward Kitsis said that [...] "Jack has … always been a man of science, and there has to be something logical. [...] The scene where Jack <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> at the bench where Hurley sits when Charlie visits him, I think in that moment he's thinking, my life right now is pretty good, I don't want to end up here." [...] In regard to the contrast in Kate's character on the island and after the island, Kitsis said that [...] "you could say [...] motherhood suits her. [...] In the flashforwards … there's a sense of purpose to her, there's some clarity to her. [...] There's so much devotion to that child, and she appears to be such a great mother … taking care of Aaron may have helped her put away some other issues." ...|$|E
500|$|Her {{marriage}} to Ernst suffered a further blow in 1897, when Victoria {{returned home from}} a visit to her sister Queen Marie of Romania and reportedly caught Ernst {{in bed with a}} male servant. She did not make her accusation public, but told a niece that [...] "no boy was safe, from the stable hands to the kitchen help. He slept quite openly with them all." [...] Queen Victoria was saddened when she heard of trouble in the marriage from Sir George Buchanan, her chargé d'affaires, but refused to consider permitting her grandchildren to divorce because of their daughter, Elisabeth. Efforts to rekindle the marriage failed and, when Queen Victoria died in January 1901, significant opposition {{to the end of the}} marriage was removed. The Supreme Court of Hesse dissolved the marriage on 21 December 1901. Ernst, who had at first resisted the divorce, came to believe it was the only possible step. [...] "Now that I am calmer I see the absolute impossibility of going on leading a life which was killing her and driving me nearly mad," [...] Ernst wrote to his elder sister Princess Louis of Battenberg. [...] "For to keep up your spirits and a laughing face while ruin <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> you in the eyes and misery is tearing your heart to pieces is a struggle which is fruitless. I only tried for her sake. If I had not loved her so, I would have given it up long ago." [...] Princess Louis later wrote that she was less surprised by the divorce than Ernst was. [...] "Though both had done their best to make a success of their marriage, it had been a failure ...heir characters and temperaments were quite unsuited to each other and I had noticed how they were gradually drifting apart." [...] The divorce of the reigning Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Hesse caused scandal in the royal circles of Europe. Tsar Nicholas wrote to his mother that even death would have been better than [...] "the general disgrace of a divorce." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of Quagmire's wedding, Lois' breasts have gotten very large after {{deciding}} to wean Stewie, {{on the advice of}} Brian. While at the reception, the top of her shirt rips open. Peter notices that Quagmire <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> at Lois' huge breasts, and deliberately spills champagne on them. Peter then [...] "helps" [...] Lois by shaking her, which makes her large breasts jiggle. This arouses Quagmire, and he realizes that he has made a mistake by marrying Joan. He informs Joan that some of his friends think they should get an annulment after discussing it with Peter, Joe and Cleveland, but she threatens to cut herself and him if he annuls their marriage. As a result, Peter decides to help Quagmire fake his death. He shows Joan a video of Quagmire being attacked by a ninja (Joe), a Nazi (Cleveland), a [...] "pots and pans" [...] robot (Peter), and the body being consumed by a dinosaur held by Peter (to the theme of Jurassic Park). Joan is unconvinced by the video. Peter and his friends then operate plan B, which consists of Quagmire pretending to suffer a heart attack and die. Quagmire is buried in a coffin with enough oxygen to last him {{a short period of time}} so Peter can return after the funeral has finished and dig him up. However, when Mayor West announces that all coffins must be buried in concrete (to guard against zombies), Peter exclaims that Quagmire is not dead, and brings him out of the coffin, alive. Death shows up to retrieve his body. Joan pleads for Quagmire's life, and touches Death's arm, which kills her instantly. Death takes Joan instead, as [...] "she was suicidal and her last name was Quagmire." [...] However, before he leaves, Quagmire asks Death to leave the body for another five minutes, thus turning him back into his old usual self.|$|E

2500|$|Editors Bryant and Springer suggest {{perception}} {{is a central}} theme, the difficulty of seeing and understanding, which makes deep reality hard to discover and truth hard to pin down. Ahab explains that, like all things, the evil whale wears a disguise: [...] "All visible objects, man, are but pasteboard masks" [...] — and Ahab is determined to [...] "strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside, except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall" [...] (Ch. 36, [...] "The Quarter-Deck"). This theme pervades the novel, perhaps never so emphatically as in [...] "The Doubloon" [...] (Ch. 99), where each crewmember perceives the coin in a way shaped by his own personality. Later, the American edition has Ahab [...] "discover no sign" [...] (Ch. 133) of the whale when he <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> into the deep. In fact, Moby Dick is then swimming up at him. In the British edition, Melville changed the word [...] "discover" [...] to [...] "perceive", and with good reason, for [...] "discovery" [...] means finding what is already there, but [...] "perceiving", or better still, perception, is [...] "a matter of shaping what exists by {{the way in which}} we see it". The point is not that Ahab would discover the whale as an object, but that he would perceive it as a symbol of his making.|$|E
2500|$|Horn's first {{photographic}} installation, You Are The Weather (1994-1996), {{a photographic}} cycle featuring 100 close-up {{shots of the}} same woman, Margret, {{in a variety of}} Icelandic geothermal pools, deals with the enigma of identity captured through a series of facial expressions dictated by imperceptible weather changes. Horn described her goals for this project in the Art:21 documentary series, [...] "“In the case of You Are the Weather, I was curious to see if I could elicit a place from her face, almost like a landscape. Not in the literal sense, but how close those identities were.” [...] Notes written by Horn about this work were included in the catalogue that accompanied Horn's 2009 traveling retrospective Roni Horn aka Roni Horn. The two-volume book included a Subject Index that brought together writings and reflections on works, themes, titles and topics related to Horn's practice. About You are the Weather, Horn writes, [...] "The way this work is shot and installed, the viewer is voyeurized by the view. You are surrounded by a woman who <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> at you." [...] Curator Donna De Salvo continues this suggestively erotic interplay between subject and object in one of her own contributions to the Subject Index, [...] "You are the Weather depicts a living, rather than an inert, thing. Horn complicated the notion of surface and skin. This treatment of the face smudges the distinction between object and subject. Just who is the 'you'? Of course all answers are completely dependent upon who chooses to inhabit the role of 'you.' It's a discovery process, which in some ways reflects the making of the work itself. The subtle and not so subtle difference in these photographs make it difficult for a viewer to dismiss any one image as being identical to the one next to it. 'You' have to look hard." ...|$|E
