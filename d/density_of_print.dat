40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{preparation}} of nitrocellulose-based flexographic inks suitable for printing on biaxially- oriented polypropylene (BOPP), for which the adhesion of the manufactured ink to the BOPP substrate is an essential property of importance. The choice of BOPP as the main substrate in this study follows from its position {{as one of the}} more commonly used substrates for printing worldwide. The importance of using fumaric rosin UCH 150 H in preparation of flexographic inks resulted from the experience of using this resin in preparing flexographic polyamide inks, where the adhesion results were very good, when this resin was added to flexographic nitrocellulose inks, the adhesion was improved remarkebly. Two polymers are used in this study: fumaric rosin (UCH 150 H) and a polyurethane (Surkopak 5323) and many formulations were tested. The use of fumaric rosin to form flexographic inks instead of polyurethane was novel. When used in combination with polyurethane as an additive in nitrocellulose flexographic inks rather than titanium acetyl-acetonates (TAA,) this offers benefits, as (TAA,) has many disadvantages when used to prepare flexographic inks for printing on BOPP. Comparative tests of the adhesion of the inks to the substrate are carried out by tape test after printing the two prepared inks on BOPP and subjecting these to Corona treatment. The principal factor influencing the adhesion is found to be the polymer structure, and it is found that the inks prepared by using UCH 150 H exhibited better adhesion to the BOPP substrate than those prepared from Surkopak 5323. Analytical techniques were employed to provide information as to why the adhesion was superior when using the ink prepared from UCH 150 H, including wetting contact angle measurements, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron diffractive X-ray (EDX), atomic force microscopy (AFM), electronic scanning for chemical analysis (ESCA), Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and inverse gas chromatography (IGC). The novelty in using IGC to study BOPP coated separately with UCH 150 H and Surkopak 5323 facilitates the comparison of physical properties associated with the polymer before and after printing on BOPP. Furthermore, the substitution of Surkopak 5323 by UCH 150 H is better for the environment as the latter is derived primarily from natural products (e. g. colophony from pine trees), while Surkopak 5323 is based on an isocyanate precursor which is no longer used in the UK for health and safety considerations, although still used in other countries such as middle east (Leach and Pierce, 1999). On this basis, polyurethanes were replaced by amine-cured epoxy systems in the UK, but both these and the polyurethanes are more expensive than UCH 150 H,which is another attraction of using UCH 150 H in flexographic inks. The implementation of optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy confirms that UCH 150 H had better adhesion on BOPP when incorporated in flexographic ink than Surkopak 5323. The results gained from EDX also confirm that the oxygen content increased by increasing the UCH 150 H and Surkopak 5323 composition in the flexographic ink printed on BOPP. Application of the tape test confirms that the remaining ink layer on the BOPP surface after applying the test, is the residue of adhered polymer layer which is greater in the case of UCH 150 H than Surkopak 5323. AFM confirms that the surface of BOPP coated with UCH 150 H was positively charged and the surface of BOPP coated with Surkopak 5323 was negatively charged. Other techniques such as IR, NMR and ESCA confirm the chemical structure of UCH 150 H and Surkopak 5323; the presence of un-reacted carboxylic acid in the UCH 150 H, is found {{to play an important role}} in adhesion according to IGC studies. These data suggest that the superior adhesion is the result of interacting acidic groups with BOPP surface by hydrogen bonds, where the basicity increases after adhesion of UCH 150 H and Surkopak 5323 to BOPP substrate. The flexographic inks prepared by using fumaric rosin UCH 150 H were tried in many print houses and the results of the print were acceptable, especially the adhesion. On the other hand, the ink was commercially competitive compared to the available flexographic inks in the market, besides, the safety of using fumaric rosin UCH 150 H for food substrates because of its natural source. It should be noted that flexographic ink preparation, printing substrates, tape test, viscosity measurements, colour <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>print,</b> wetting measurements and optical microscopy were done in the lab of ink factory (TOPINKS) in Aleppo-Syria.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} {{the stability of the}} characteristics <b>of</b> digitally <b>printed</b> graphic image symbols, the resistance <b>of</b> graphic element <b>prints</b> to the temperature changes and mechanical friction was studied. During investigation, <b>prints</b> <b>of</b> graphic elements <b>printed</b> by direct and indirect thermographic methods, digital and offset printing were used. Papers with different temperature sensitivity, surface morphology and hydrophobic properties were used for the specimens printing. It was show that thermographically produced specimens, subjected to temperature changes under mechanical wear, showed a different optical density decrease. The highest optical density decrease (from 2. 05 to 0. 30) was noticed in the element printed on COAT PC paper by indirect thermographic method, using Wax ink transfer ribbon. The prints on PP White paper, using Wax ink transfer ribbon, also showed significant decrease of wear resistance. In this case the print quality did not meet the standard requirements. The prints on PP White paper, using resin-based ink transfer ribbon, got wear much less (the optical density changed from 1. 71 to 1. 43, thus meeting the standard requirements). When offset prints were subjected to mechanical wear after a jump temperature change, the highest decrease in optical density was found in prints on Gloss paper (from 1. 63 to 1. 37), and the lowest – on offset paper (from 1. 19 to 1. 12).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop new digital halftoning algorithms targeting high-quality, high-speed electro-photographic (EP) printing for scan-to-print applications. Conventionally, AM halftoning modulates the size <b>of</b> <b>printed</b> dots. It has very low computation load, good print stability for EP printing, but poor spatial resolution and Moire resistance. Alternatively, FM halftoning modulates the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>printed</b> dots. It can achieve high spatial resolution and is free of Moire artifacts; but it may lack the required print stability needed for EP printing. ^ To combine the advantages of both AM and FM halftoning methods, we first developed an algorithm called AM/FM halftoning, which simultaneously modulates dot size and dot density to render gray levels. AM/FM halftoning first determines the position of each dot using a dispersed dot halftoning algorithm and a dot density curve. The size of each dot is then modulated according to a dot size curve. A measurement-based parameter design system is developed to optimize both the dot size and dot density curves. A specific implementation of AM/FM halftoning is developed for electro-photographic printers having subpixel modulation ability such as Hewlett-Packard 2 ̆ 7 s pulse width modulation (PWM) technology. Dot size diffusion (DSD) and dot size screening (DSS) techniques are also developed for use when the quantization levels of PWM are insufficient. For parallel hardware implementation of AM/FM halftoning, a boundary-stitching algorithm is developed to reduce the halftone texture artifacts across the stripe boundary. AM/FM halftoning is also developed for color printing. ^ To further improve the print stability and image quality, we generalize AM/FM halftoning to an algorithm called clustered AM/FM halftoning. Similar to AM/FM halftoning, it still simultaneously modulates dot size and dot density. Moreover, with tone-dependent optimal cluster control, the algorithm achieves even better print stability and image quality than can be achieved with AM/FM halftoning. Clustered AM/FM halftoning is also extended to color printing. ...|$|R

Printed Circuit Heat Exchanger manufacturing process is followed by chemical etching and chemical bonding. Microchannel for fluid flow are constructed by chemical etching of the metal plates according to different configuration then plates are stacked alternately and assembled by diffusion bonding. Due to its compact size, high efficiency, large heat transfer area PCHE (microchannel heat exchanger) are used in cryogenic refrigeration and liquefaction systems. A counter flow rectangular microchannel (40 mm × 1. 6 mm × 1. 2 mm) printed circuit heat exchanger is designed and simulated using commercial ANSYS FLUENT. The performance is investigated numerically with helium at cryogenic temperature. The performance is affected by axial conduction at low Reynolds number (Re = 100).

Resources have been channeled to develop various requirements pertaining to the design and processing of surface mount connectors. This paper summarizes {{some of the key}} developments in relation to the evolution of the pager design. Pagers have become small, cheap and reliable. With the drive towards smaller and slimmer pagers with increased functions, a two-printed-circuit-board-construction is needed for design flexibility due to the great variations in language and feature sets. What you can hold in your hand, you can drop. Therefore the pager (and the connector inside) must be mechanically rugged enough to take the various impacts in the course of its useful life and continue to function as designed. 2 To minimize the void area in the pager, the board-to-board connector stacked height is driven down to the height of the tallest components. Besides switching from through-hole to surface mount technology, connector density has been moved from 1. 27 mm to 1. 0 mm, and gradually to 0. 8 mm and 0. 5 mm pitch {{in order to meet the}} demands for miniaturization. Added to that, connectors also switched from pin-and-socket to blade-on-beam design technology to meet the demand for a robust system that can withstand physical shocks suffered by smaller, denser and more complex pagers.

After drying, the prints were used for rub testing. The impact of the basic properties of coated paper {{and the content of}} reducer in inks on rub resistance were discussed {{on the basis of a}} comparative analysis of the experimental data. Printing color density loss rate and print color difference were exploited in this paper to characterize the ink rub resistance for coated paper prints. In this study, it was found that ink rub resistance was mainly influenced by ink absorbency and smoothness of the paper. Under the similar conditions, the color <b>density</b> <b>of</b> coated paper <b>print</b> decreases with the rub strength increasing, color difference increased gradually, but not linearly. With the increase of ink viscosity reducer content, printing density loss rates as well as color difference changed, but not be linearly...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} if there is a proper press sequence for a specific set of process inks on a specified type of paper. In the past, the literature on this subject has been of a qualitative and generalized nature. This study attempts to put the matter on a quantative basis under strict controls. A standard set of process proofing inks for web offset are chosen to be printed onto a coated type of offset paper by an IGT Printability Tester. Various techniques are devised for <b>printing</b> solid strips <b>of</b> the inks with minimum density variation across each strip and from strip to strip. The <b>density</b> range <b>of</b> each ink is found by employing various techniques devised by the manufacturer of the IGT, and by using mathematical formulas. The <b>density</b> <b>of</b> each ink is plotted against its ink quantity, as read by each of three filters on a densitometer: Green, Yellow and Blue. The GATF formulas for determining the color characteristics of process inks are then employed. The results are tables for each ink showing the theoretical <b>density</b> <b>of</b> each filter reading at specified ink quantities, with the GATF Hue Error, Grayness and Efficiency factors included for those ink quantities. These tables allow for the predicted result of any overprints at specified ink quantities by adding the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> each filter reading at the desired ink quantity of each ink. In order to be as accurate as possible, a special technique is devised to read both single and overprint <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> ink films <b>printed</b> on the IGT. Overprints are made using an IGT Printability Tester, and a densitometer to compare actual to predicted values. Under controlled trapping, all conditions are kept constant, but the sequence is reversed. The sequence that comes the closest to the predicted values is the preferred sequence. This is found to be: Cyan, Magenta and Yellow. Although a preferred color sequence does exist for the set of inks used in this study, it is pointed out that a change in this sequence may help the overall result in certain cases...|$|R

40|$|Boundary scan and {{built-in}} self-test are {{supplemented by}} conventional testing techniques. Eight discrete levels of testing were implemented. by Cary J. Wright The HP E 5200 A broadband service analyzer {{is a highly}} complex digital system packed into a field-portable case. During its design, it was essential to achieve the highest densities possible by {{using some of the}} latest technologies. To achieve the functionality required, the main processor printed circuit assembly for the product had to be extremely densely populated. This printed circuit assembly contains over 1000 components, including 29 XFP parts, 30 FP parts, and almost 8700 solder joints (see “HP E 5200 A Broadband Service Analyzer Surface Mount Assembly ” for further details). Because <b>of</b> the sheer <b>density</b> <b>of</b> the <b>printed</b> circuit assembly, testing by conventional bed-of-nails in-circuit techniques alone was not feasible. In addition, normal defect rates specified by surface mount placement vendors were in the order of 200 ppm. From this data, each printed circuit assembly was predicted to have at least one defective solder joint after the placement process. Because of the high cost <b>of</b> this <b>printed</b> circuit assembly, it was very important to be able to accurately and quickly identify defects with high success rates. The target yield for the assembly and commissioning process was set to 100 %. Overall Test Strategy To overcome the challenges presented, it was necessary to implement a comprehensive test strategy that included boundary scan and built-in self-test, supplemented by conventional testing techniques. With this complex printed circuit assembly it was decided that a multitiered testing strategy would be used. Such a strategy would increase yield by identifying faults early and by verifying functionality in small discrete stages. Another advantage was that the tests could be reused for other purposes such as service, calibration, or confidence tests. Fig. 1 shows the production test strategy that was implemented for the service analyzer project. Eight discrete levels of testing were implemented. Each level verifies basic functionality before proceeding to the next stage of assembly or testing. The chance of catastrophic and difficult-to-diagnose failures is minimized...|$|R
