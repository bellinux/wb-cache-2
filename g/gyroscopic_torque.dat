50|$|ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control System)An ADCS {{designed}} {{from scratch}} around STM32F4 MCU, determining attitude and position through sensor fusion (GPS, magnetometer, gyro, sun sensor). The sensor fusion algorithm used {{is based on}} an alternative implementation of Wahba’s problem, in order to accommodate gyro measurements, as introduced in. This implementation uses a virtual vector base, propagated by the gyro reading, fused with the vectors provided by the sun sensor and the magnetometer, as per Wahba’s problem. This forms essentially a complementary filter in SO(3) between the gyro and the vector measurements. The reference vectors in ECI frame are calculated by and IGRF model, respectively, given the satellites position is known by the GPS and SGP4 model.The control system is based on a spin torquer, which is used as a reaction wheel for pitch control and also to stiffen roll and yaw to the satellite's orbit plane (<b>Gyroscopic</b> <b>torque</b> and momentum bias). Magneto-torquers are also used to dampen the roll and yaw motion while also control pitch angle.|$|E
50|$|Engine {{reliability}} {{and power to}} weight ratios were major problems in early aviation. The engine and its accessories weighed 185 kg (408 lb), making it 40% lighter than a rotary engine of equivalent power. (Note: This empty weight {{does not include the}} radiator and coolant fluid. Generally, air-cooled engines are lighter than their equivalent horsepower water-cooled counterparts. For example, the Bentley BR2 rotary put out 230 hp and weighed 220 kg, Clerget 9B rotary 130 hp,173 kg.) The new engine was presented to the French Ministry of War in February 1915, and tested for 15 hours at full power. This was standard procedure for a new engine design to be admitted into military service. However, because of lobbying by French engine manufacturers, the Spanish-made engine was ordered to undergo a bench test that no French-made engine had yet passed: a 50-hour run at full speed. The HS-8A was therefore sent back to Chalais-Meudon on July 21, 1915 and tested for 50 hours, succeeding against all expectations. The design also promised far more development potential than rotary engines which, in spite of being the most common type then in use for aircraft, were getting close to the limits of their potential. Rotary engines of increased power generally had increased weight, which in turn increased the already serious <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>torque</b> generated by the engine's rotation. A further increase in torque was considered unacceptable, and the power to weight ratio of the new rotary engines under development did not appeal to aircraft designers.|$|E

It follows that the pitch and yaw motion of the vehicle with respect to inertial space will introduce additional unwanted, <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>torques.</b> These give rise to unsatisfactory equilibria, but more seriously, cause a loss of static stability when turning in one direction, and an increase in static stability in the opposite direction.

40|$|Abstract. Experimental {{evidence}} suggests that when a torque is applied to a spinning gyroscope such that the torque axis is perpendicular to the spin axis, then an induced torque will be generated in the gyroscope that is mutually perpendicular to both the spin axis, and to the applied torque axis.

40|$|A dual {{momentum}} {{vector control}} concept, {{consisting of two}} counterrotating rings (each designated as an annular momentum control device), was studied for pointing and slewing control of large spacecraft. In a disturbance free space environment, the concept provides for three axis pointing and slewing capabilities while requiring no expendables. The approach utilizes two large diameter counterrotating rings or wheels suspended magnetically in many race supports distributed around the antenna structure. When the magnets are energized, attracting the two wheels, the resulting <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>torque</b> produces a rate along the appropriate axis. Roll control is provided by alternating the radiative rotational velocity of the two wheels. Wheels with diameters of 500 to 800 m and with sufficient momentum storage capability require rims only a few centimeters thick.

The development of multirotor vehicles such as quadcopters and octocopters, has {{reached a point where}} they are cheap and versatile enough to start becoming a part of everyday life. It is clear to say that the future applications seem limitless. This thesis goes through the steps of development, modelling and control design of an octocopter system. The developed octocopter builds on a concept of using the mini computer Raspberry Pi together with the code generation functionality of Matlab/Simulink. The mathematical modelling of the octocopter includes the thrust and torques generated by the propellers, added with <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>torque.</b> These are combined with the aerodynamic effects caused by incoming air. The importance of modelling the later mentioned effects has increased with the demand of precise controlled extreme manoeuvres.

The controllers show good performance in simulations and are approved for flight tests, which are conducted on two separate occasions. The octocopter makes two successful flights, proving that the concept can be applied on multirotor vehicles. However, there is a miss-match between the mathematical model and the physical octocopter, leaving questions for future work...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{stability}} of circular orbits of the electromagnetic two-body problem in an electromagnetic setting that includes retarded and advanced interactions. We give a method to derive the equations of tangent dynamics about circular orbits up to nonlinear terms and we derive the linearized equations explicitly. In particular we study the normal modes of the linearized dynamics that have an arbitrarily large imaginary eigenvalue. These large imaginary eigenvalues define fast frequencies that introduce a fast (stiff) timescale into the dynamics. As an application of Dirac's electrodynamics of point charges with retarded-only interactions, we study the conditions for the two charges to perform a fast gyrating motion of small radius about a circular orbit. The fast gyration defines an angular momentum {{of the order of}} the orbital angular momentum, a vector that rotates in the orbital plane at a frequency of the order of the orbital frequency and causes a <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>torque.</b> We explore a consequence of this multiscale solution, i. e; the resonance condition that the angular momentum of the stiff spinning should rotate exactly at the orbital frequency. The resonant orbits turn out to have angular momenta that are integer multiples of Planck's constant to a good approximation. Among the many qualitative agreements with quantum electrodynamics (QED), the orbital frequency of the resonant orbits are given by a difference of two eigenvalues of a linear operator and the emission lines of QED agree with our predictions within a few percent.

40|$|The Variable Vector Countermeasure Suit (V 2 Suit) is a {{countermeasure}} {{suit for}} sensorimotor adaptation and musculoskeletal deconditioning in microgravity. The V 2 suit {{will consist of}} modules containing arrays of control moment gyroscopes (CMGs) which will be controlled to provide viscous resistance to motion against a specified direction. To reduce the coordination and sensorimotor problems seen during and following gravity level transitions, this resistance will be felt {{in the direction of}} "down" to mimic gravity. In microgravity, visual cues are dominant for orientation perception and one's perceived direction of "down" may change for a variety of reasons. The resistance felt by the V 2 suit wearer is a <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>torque</b> vector perpendicular to the direction of "down"; in order to send appropriate motor control commands the user's perceived direction of "down" must be known throughout use. Algorithms have been developed to enable the user to initialize a direction of "down" track this direction (as well as the module orientation and other relevant information) throughout operation. Control moment gyroscopes are commonly used for spacecraft stabilization. The V 2 Suit aims to miniaturize a CMG array for use inside wearable modules mounted on body segments. A trade study was conducted, analyzing various candidate CMG arrays to determine the appropriate architecture for the array inside a V 2 Suit module. The selected array is a 4 CMG pyramid array, chosen for a combination of torque output performance and size and hardware considerations. A detailed mechanical design for the V 2 Suit CMG array has been developed for the production of a brassboard prototype unit. Steering laws for singularity avoidance and resetting the gimbal angles have been presented, and will be tested with the brassboard unit.
