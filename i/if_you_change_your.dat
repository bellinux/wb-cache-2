6000|$|He blushed all over, but {{carried it}} off as boldly as he could. [...] "Well, well," [...] he said, [...] "that's right! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> minds before the Aroostook sails, you let me know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Littleson said, [...] "I {{have warned}} you. You are a crank, and a foolish one at that. You are going about asking for trouble, and I {{think you will}} find it. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> mind, come to me at Claridge's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] she said, [...] "I {{have warned}} you. It {{is for you}} to act as you think best. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> mind, come to me. I will give you {{sanctuary}} at any time. Take me to my automobile, please." ...|$|E

6000|$|At parting Le Chapelier again exhorted {{him to give}} {{thought to}} what he proposed. [...] "Send me word <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> mind. I am lodged at the Cerf, and I shall be here until the day after to-morrow. If you have ambition, this is your moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There," [...] he said, {{loosening}} {{the cord}} around his left wrist, [...] "drink that, {{and think it}} over. We shall be gone for about ten minutes. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> mind before, ring that little hand-bell.

6000|$|... 'Well, Fernan,' {{said his}} uncle, {{suddenly}} withdrawing his attempt {{when he found}} it vain, 'you seem hardly in marching order, so I'm off by the night train; but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> mind in the next week, write to me at Peter Brown's--you know--and I'll run down.

60|$|ABSOLUTE I am entirely at your disposal, sir: <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{should think}} of {{addressing}} Miss Languish yourself, I suppose {{you would have}} me marry the aunt; or <b>if</b> <b>you</b> should <b>change</b> <b>your</b> mind, and take the old lady--'tis the same to me--I'll marry the niece.|$|R
60|$|ANNIE. Oh! thank you, Miss. I'm very sorry. Of course <b>if</b> <b>you</b> was to <b>change</b> <b>your</b> mind--[She stops, embarrassed].|$|R
6000|$|... "They want to shut up," [...] he said. [...] "My {{advice is}} that you should tell Oliver and Perrott to-morrow that you've made up your mind that you don't mean to marry either of them. I'm certain you don't. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> mind you can always tell them so. They're both {{sensible}} men; they'll understand. And then all this bother will be over." [...] He got up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I did," [...] said Wesson, [...] "when I {{thought you}} had some glimmerings of intelligence. But if it gives you any {{pleasure}} to behave like the juvenile lead in a melodrama, by all means do. Personally, I shouldn't have thought the game would be worth the candle. Your keen sense of honor, I understand you to say, will force you to pay your debt. It's an expensive luxury nowadays, Spennie. You mentioned {{the end of the}} week, I believe? That will suit me admirably. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> mind, my offer is still open. Good night, Galahad." ...|$|E
6000|$|Beric {{was silent}} for a minute. [...] "I do not seek to alter your determination, mother, but as for myself, so long as I can lift a sword I shall {{continue}} to struggle against the Romans. We shall not meet tomorrow; when the battle once begins all will be confusion, {{and there would be no}} finding each other in this vast crowd. If victory is ours, we shall meet afterwards; if defeat, I shall make for Cardun, where, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> mind, I shall hope to meet you, and then shall march with those who will for the swamps of Ely, where doubtless large numbers of fugitives will gather, for unless the Romans drive their causeways into its very heart they can scarce penetrate in any other way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{we shall}} be quite lost without you. And I wanted to say this to you, Don Ippolito, that <b>if</b> ever <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> mind again, and {{conclude}} to come to America, you must write to me, and {{let me help you}} just as I had intended to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Sir Wingrave," [...] he said, [...] "if {{there is}} really nothing I can do for you, I will go. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> should <b>change</b> <b>your</b> mind, <b>you</b> have only to telephone. You can command me at any time. I am only anxious to be of service to you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am astonished," [...] wrote Lady Belamour to her cousin, [...] "that {{you should}} decline so highly {{advantageous}} an Offer for your Daughter. I can only understand it as a Token that you desire no further Connection with, nor Favour from me; and I shall therefore require {{of you to}} give up the Accounts, and vacate the House by Michaelmas next ensuing. However, as I am willing to allow some excuse for the Weakness of parental Affection, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> Mind within the next Week and send up your Daughter with Dove and his Wife, I will overlook your first hasty and foolish Refusal, ungrateful as it was, and will receive your Daughter and give her all the Advantages I promised. Otherwise your Employment is at an end, and you had better prepare your Accounts for Hargrave's Inspection." ...|$|E

2500|$|Representative Smith {{told the}} Investigative Subcommittee that Representative Miller {{specifically}} threatened {{to work against}} his son {{if he did not}} change his vote. Representative Smith’s recollection was that Representative Miller [...] "came up and said something like, I haven't been involved in this campaign before, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>change</b> <b>your</b> vote, I'll get involved, and I'll make sure Brad isn't elected." ...|$|R

"It don't {{seem to be}} the {{military}} fashion for Americans to obey a command so strictly, an' I'm afraid you're settin' a bad example to them who demand that a list of the supplies be read to 'em whenever they're feelin' a bit out of sorts.

6000|$|THE DEVIL. [amiably] Fare you well, Don Juan. I shall {{often think}} of our {{interesting}} chats about things in general.

5000|$|Years {{later she}} {{recalled}} that {{she ran into}} him at a Washington, D.C. restaurant shortly after the Roosevelt administration came into power, He came {{across the room to}} her table and asked her what she wanted in the way of an appointment. When she told him nothing, that already she had had all she wanted from politics-lots of fun, lots of work, and lots of fine friends-he said: [...] "Well, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> mind and I can help, let me know, for if anyone is entitled to the fruits of victory you are that one." [...] They remained close friends until her death in 1951.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{no other}} solution. Now what shall we do? Now, {{if we want to}} make this great State of Pakistan happy and prosperous, we should wholly and solely {{concentrate}} on the well-being of the people, and especially of the masses and the poor. If you will work in co-operation, forgetting the past, burying the hatchet, you are bound to succeed. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> past and work together in a spirit that everyone of you, no matter to what community he belongs, no matter what relations he had with you in the past, no matter what is his colour, caste or creed, is first, second and last a citizen of this State with equal rights, privileges, and obligations, there will be no end to the progress you will make.I cannot emphasize it too much. We should begin to work in that spirit and in course of time all these angularities of the majority and minority communities, the Hindu community and the Muslim community, because even as regards Muslims you have Pathans, Punjabis, Shia's, Sunnis and so on, and among the Hindus you have Brahmins, Vashnavas, Khatris, also Bengalis, Madrasis and so on, will vanish. Indeed if you ask me, this has been the biggest hindrance in the way of India to attain the freedom and independence and but for this we would have been free people long long ago. No power can hold another nation, and specially a nation of 400 million souls in subjection; nobody could have conquered you, and even if it had happened, nobody could have continued its hold on you for any length of time, but for this. Therefore, we must learn a lesson from this. You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place or worship in this state of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed {{that has nothing to do}} with the business of the state. As you know, history shows that in England, conditions, some time ago, were much worse than those prevailing in India today. The Roman Catholics and the Protestants persecuted each other. Even now there are some states in existence where there are discriminations made and bars imposed against a particular class. Thank God, we are not starting in those days. We are starting in the days where there is no discrimination, no distinction between one community and another, no discrimination between one caste or creed and another. [...] We are starting with this fundamental principle that we are all citizens and equal citizens of one state. The people of England in course of time had to face the realities of the situation and had to discharge the responsibilities and burdens placed upon them by the government of their country and they went through that fire step by step. Today, you might say with justice that Roman Catholics and Protestants do not exist; what exists now is that every man is a citizen, an equal citizen of Great Britain and they are all members of the nation.Now I think we should keep that in front of us as our ideal and you will find that in course of time Hindus would cease to be Hindus and Muslims would cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, because that is the personal faith of each individual, but in the political sense as citizens of the state.
