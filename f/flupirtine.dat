40|$|<b>Flupirtine</b> is a {{centrally}} acting, non-opioid analgesic that {{is available}} {{in a number of}} European countries for the treatment of a variety of pain states. The therapeutic benefits seen with <b>flupirtine</b> relate to its unique pharmacological properties. <b>Flupirtine</b> displays indirect NDMA receptor antagonism via activation of potassium channels and is the first representative of a pharmacological class denoted the 'selective neuronal potassium channel openers'. The generation of the M-current is facilitated by <b>flupirtine</b> via the opening of neuronal Kv 7 potassium channels. The opening of these channels inhibits exaggerated neuronal action potential generation and controls neuronal excitability. Neuronal hyperexcitability is a physiological component of many pain states such as chronic pain, migraine and neurogenic pain. Although large-scale clinical trials are lacking, the clinical trial database available to date from smaller-scale studies, together with extensive clinical experience, indicate that <b>flupirtine</b> effectively reduces chronic musculoskeletal pain, migraine and neuralgias, amongst other types of pain. In addition, <b>flupirtine</b> produces, at recommended clinical doses, muscle-relaxing effects in the presence of abnormally increased muscle tension. Its analgesic and muscle-relaxant properties were comparable to tramadol and chlormezanone, respectively, in two prospective trials in patients with lower back pain. Cytoprotective, anti-apoptotic and antioxidant properties have also been associated with <b>flupirtine</b> use in a small number of studies to date. When provided as combination therapy with morphine, <b>flupirtine</b> increases the antinociceptive activity of morphine 4 -fold. <b>Flupirtine</b> displays superior tolerability when compared with tramadol and pentazocine. The most common adverse effects associated with <b>flupirtine</b> use are drowsiness, dizziness, heartburn, dry mouth, fatigue and nausea. With respect to its molecular structure, mechanism of action and adverse event profile, <b>flupirtine</b> is a unique drug. <b>Flupirtine</b> is an analgesic with many potential therapeutic benefits that may prove useful in the treatment of many disease states...|$|E
40|$|Combination {{therapy with}} two drugs is a {{straightforward}} strategy {{to improve the}} risk-benefit ratio of analgesic treatments. <b>Flupirtine</b> is a non-opioid analgesic drug acting via the enhancement of so-called M currents, associated to Kv 7 potassium channels in the central nervous system. In this study we used the orofacial formalin test {{as a model of}} acute inflammatory pain in the rat; putative synergistic interactions between <b>flupirtine</b> and morphine or tramadol, given in various combinations, were investigated. We found that <b>flupirtine</b> exerts antinociception in {{the second phase of the}} test, whereas morphine and tramadol induced analgesia both in the first and in the second phase. An isobolographic analysis of data was carried out, showing a synergistic interaction between <b>flupirtine</b> and morphine, as well as between <b>flupirtine</b> and tramadol, in the second phase of the test. Conversely, in the first phase of the test only a single combination of morphine plus <b>flupirtine,</b> but not any of the combinations of tramadol and <b>flupirtine,</b> resulted in a synergistic interaction. Our data clearly indicate that <b>flupirtine</b> enhances in a synergistic manner the acute antinociceptive effects exerted by opioids in this paradigm...|$|E
40|$|<b>Flupirtine</b> is an {{analgesic}} agent which exhibits neuronal cytoprotective {{activity and}} may have value {{in the treatment of}} conditions involving cell injury and apoptosis. Since <b>flupirtine</b> has no action on known receptor sites we have investigated the effect of this drug on mitochondrial membrane potential, and the changes in intramitochondrial calcium concentration in particular. The findings show that <b>flupirtine</b> increases Ca 2 + uptake in mitochondria in vitro. At clinically relevant <b>flupirtine</b> concentrations, corresponding to <b>flupirtine</b> levels in vitro of 0. 2 to 10 [*]nmol[*]mg− 1 mitochondrial protein, there was a 2 to 3 fold increase in mitochondrial calcium levels (P< 0. 01). At supra-physiological <b>flupirtine</b> concentrations of 20 [*]nmol[*]mg− 1 mitochondrial protein and above, the mitochondrial calcium concentrations were indistinguishable from those in untreated mitochondria. Mitochondrial membrane potential closely paralleled the changes in mitochondrial calcium levels showing a 20 % (P< 0. 01) increase when the <b>flupirtine</b> concentration was raised from 0. 2 [*]nmol to 10 [*]nmol[*]mg− 1 mitochondrial protein and a return to control values at 20 [*]nmol[*]mg− 1 protein. The increase in mitochondrial calcium uptake and membrane potential were accompanied by an increase in mitochondrial ATP synthesis (30 %; P< 0. 05) and a similar percentage reduction in mitochondrial volume. Calcium at 80 and 160 [*]nmol[*]mg− 1 mitochondrial protein decreased ATP synthesis by 20 – 25 % (P< 0. 001). This decrease was prevented or diminished if <b>flupirtine</b> at 10 [*]nmol[*]mg− 1 protein was added before the addition of calcium. Since intracellular levels of <b>flupirtine</b> in intact cells never exceeded 10 [*]nmol[*]mg− 1 mitochondrial protein, these findings are supportive evidence for an in vivo cytoprotective action of <b>flupirtine</b> at the mitochondrial level...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Flupirtine</b> is an {{analgesic}} with muscle-relaxing {{properties that}} activates Kv 7 potassium channels. Kv 7 channels are expressed along myelinated and unmyelinated peripheral axons where their activation {{is expected to}} reduce axonal excitability and potentially contribute to flupirtine’s clinical profile. Trial design: To investigate the electrical excitability of peripheral myelinated axons following orally administered <b>flupirtine,</b> in-vitro experiments on isolated peripheral nerve segments were combined with a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase I clinical trial (RCT). Methods: Threshold tracking {{was used to assess}} the electrical excitability of myelinated axons in isolated segments of human sural nerve in vitro and motoneurones to abductor pollicis brevis (APB) in situ in healthy subjects. In addition, the effect of <b>flupirtine</b> on ectopic action potential generation in myelinated axons was examined using ischemia of the lower arm. Results: <b>Flupirtine</b> (3 - 30 μM) shortened the relative refractory period and increased post-conditioned superexcitability in human myelinated axons in vitro. Similarly, in healthy subjects the relative refractory period of motoneurones to APB was reduced 2 hours after oral <b>flupirtine</b> but not following placebo. Whether this effect was due to a direct action of <b>flupirtine</b> on peripheral axons or temperature could not be resolved. <b>Flupirtine</b> (200 mg p. o.) also reduced ectopic axonal activity induced by 10 minutes of lower arm ischemia. In particular, high frequency (ca. 200 Hz) components of EMG were reduced in the post-ischemic period. Finally, visual analogue scale ratings of sensations perceived during the post-ischemic period were reduced following <b>flupirtine</b> (200 mg p. o.).

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that <b>flupirtine,</b> a {{centrally}} acting, non-opioid analgesic agent, also exhibits neuroprotective activity in focal cerebral ischaemia in mice and reduces apoptosis induced by NMDA, gp 120 of HIV, prior protein fragment or lead acetate as well as necrosis induced by glutamate or NMDA in cell culture. To study the potential mechanism of the neuroprotective action of <b>flupirtine,</b> we investigated whether <b>flupirtine</b> is able to modulate potassium or NMDA-induced currents in rat cultured hippocampal neurones by use of the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. We demonstrated that 1 [*]μM <b>flupirtine</b> activated an inwardly rectifying potassium current (Kir) in hippocampal neurones (ΔI=− 39 ± 18 [*]pA at − 130 [*]mV; n= 10). This effect was dose-dependent (EC 50 = 0. 6 [*]μM). The reversal potential for Kir was in agreement with the potassium equilibrium potential predicted from the Nernst equation showing that Kir was predominantly carried by K+. Furthermore, the induced current was blocked completely by Ba 2 + (1 [*]mM), an effect typical for Kir. The activation of Kir by <b>flupirtine</b> was largely prevented by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin (PTX) indicating the involvement of a PTX-sensitive G-protein in the transduction mechanism (ΔI=− 3 ± 6 [*]pA at − 130 [*]mV; n= 8). Inclusion of cyclic AMP in the intracellular solution completely abolished the activation of Kir (n= 7). The selective α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist SKF- 86466 (10 [*]μM), the selective 5 -HT 1 A antagonist NAN 190 as well as the selective GABAB antagonist 2 -hydroxysaclofen (10 [*]μM) failed to block the <b>flupirtine</b> effect on the inward rectifier. <b>Flupirtine</b> (1 [*]μM) could not change the current induced by 50 [*]μM NMDA.

Methods: This prospective, randomised controlled study was conducted in 60 women of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I/II, 18 - 70 years of age and scheduled to undergo gynaecological ambulatory surgeries. The participants were randomised to receive either 100 mg oral <b>flupirtine</b> maleate (group <b>flupirtine,</b> n = 30) or 800 mg oral ibuprofen (group ibuprofen, n = 30), 1 h prior to surgery and then every 8 h for 48 h.

40|$|Objective Current {{treatments}} for cancer pain are often inadequate, particularly when metastasis to bone is involved. The {{addition to the}} treatment regimen of another drug that has a complementary analgesic effect may increase the overall analgesia without the necessity to increase doses, thus avoiding dose-related side effects. This project investigated the synergistic effect of {{the addition of the}} potassium channel (KCNQ 2 – 3) modulator <b>flupirtine</b> to morphine treatment in a rat model of prostate cancer-induced bone pain. Design Syngeneic prostate cancer cells were injected into the right tibia of male Wistar rats under anesthesia. This led to expanding tumor within the bone in 2 weeks, together with the concurrent development of hyperalgesia to noxious heat. Paw withdrawal thresholds from noxious heat were measured before and after the maximum non-sedating doses of morphine and <b>flupirtine</b> given alone and in combinations. Dose-response curves for morphine (0. 13 – 5. 0 [*]mg/kg ip) and <b>flupirtine</b> (1. 25 – 10. 0 [*]mg/kg ip) given alone and in fixed-dose combinations were plotted and subjected to an isobolographic analysis. Results Both morphine (ED 50 [*]=[*] 0. 74 [*]mg/kg) and <b>flupirtine</b> (ED 50 [*]=[*] 3. 32 [*]mg/kg) caused dose-related anti-hyperalgesia at doses that did not cause sedation. Isobolographic analysis revealed that there was a synergistic interaction between <b>flupirtine</b> and morphine. Addition of <b>flupirtine</b> to morphine treatment improved morphine anti-hyperalgesia, and resulted in the reversal of cancer-induced heat hyperalgesia. Conclusions These results suggest that <b>flupirtine</b> in combination with morphine may be useful clinically to provide better analgesia at lower morphine doses in the management of pain caused by tumors growing in bone...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether <b>flupirtine</b> can slow down the changes seen in the rabbit retina after ischemia-reperfusion. Methods. A suction-cup procedure, which raises intraocular pressure, was used to give an ischemic insult to the rabbit retina. Electroretinograms were recorded before ischemia and at different periods after ischemia. In some instances, <b>flupirtine</b> was injected into the eye before ischemia. Immunohistochemistry was used to study the effect of ischemia-reperfusion on the 7 -aminobutyric acid (GABA) immunoreactivity and uptake of serotonin by the retina. The effect of <b>flupirtine</b> and ischemia on retinal adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels were determined in in vivo and in vitro experiments. Results. Ischemia for 75 minutes causes a change in the nature of normal GABA immunoreactivity and a reduction in the b-wave of the electroretinogram. When <b>flupirtine</b> is injected into the vitreous humor at the onset of ischemic insult, the changes in GABA immunoreactivity are reduced and the recovery of the reduced b-wave of the electroretinogram after defined reperfusion times is enhanced significantly.

40|$|AbstractThe {{suitability}} of the triaminopyridine derivative <b>flupirtine,</b> an analgesic drug with antioxidative property [Gassen, M., Pergande, G. and Youdim, M. B. H. (1998) Biochem.

Rat liver mitochondria were exposed to strong oxidative stress as generated by Fe 2 + plus ascorbate. Peroxidation damage of membrane lipids was followed by the measurement of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. Protein oxidation was estimated by electron spin resonance spectroscopy, after labeling of the ‘peroxidized’ mitochondria with 4 -maleimido- 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine- 1 -oxyl. We found that (i) low concentrations of <b>flupirtine</b> (10 μM) protect lipids and also proteins (with lesser efficiency) from attacks of reactive oxygen species; (ii) <b>flupirtine</b> remarkably delayed the decline of complex mitochondrial functions, such as the respiratory control or the Ca 2 + retention capacity of mitochondria, under oxidative stress; and (iii) the ADP/ATP antiporter (ANT), a main component of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery as well as a core component of the permeability transition pore complex, seems to be a membrane protein particularly protected by <b>flupirtine.</b> In conclusion, the preservation of the Ca 2 + buffer capacity of mitochondria and of the ANT activity against oxidative stress supports an antiapoptotic application of <b>flupirtine...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Flupirtine</b> is {{a unique}} non-opioid, {{centrally}} acting analgesic with muscle relaxant properties. So far no study has evaluated, use of preoperative <b>flupirtine</b> on postoperative morphine sparing effect in patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH). Materials and Methods: We performed a prospective, controlled, and randomized study in 50 female patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II, aged between 30 and 60 years scheduled for TAH under general anesthesia (GA). Patients were randomized to receive either single dose <b>flupirtine</b> 100 mg or placebo 1 h prior to surgery. A standard anesthetic and analgesic protocol was followed in both the groups. Postoperatively, a titrated loading dose of intravenous morphine 0. 1 mg/kg was followed with patient-controlled analgesia with morphine (bolus of 0. 01 mg/kg with a lockout time of 7 min). The primary outcome was cumulative morphine consumption at 48 h postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included hemodynamics, visual analog scale (VAS) at rest, VAS on cough, and any adverse effects. Results: All enrolled 50 patients completed the follow-up. The cumulative mean morphine consumption (standard deviation [SD]) at 48 h (40. 4 [6. 0] vs. 47 [6. 6] mg, P = 0. 001) was reduced in-group <b>flupirtine</b> as compared with placebo.

40|$|We have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} nonopioid analgesic <b>flupirtine</b> possesses analgesic activity in the orofacial formalin test in vivo in the rat. However, this paradigm does not allow to distinguish between central and peripheral site of action of the drug. In this study we used a recently characterized in vitro model, consisting in acute rat brainstem explants, to investigate whether <b>flupirtine</b> analgesia may be, at least in part, attributed to interference with neurotransmission {{between the first and}} the second order neurons of the trigeminal system, occurring within the brainstem. We used acute rat brainstem explants; CGRP released into the incubation medium was taken as a marker of CGRP release from central terminals of trigeminal ganglion afferent neurons within the brainstem. CGRP levels were measured by radioimmunoassay under basal conditions or in the presence of <b>flupirtine,</b> alone or with putative antagonist XE- 991. We found that <b>flupirtine</b> inhibits in a concentration-dependent manner both basal and capsaicin-stimulated CGRP release from rat brainstem. This effect is mimicked by the <b>flupirtine</b> analogue retigabine, and is counteracted by the Kv 7 blocker XE- 991. These findings provide in vitro evidence that the analgesic activity of <b>flupirtine</b> may be related to interference with pain neurotransmission at the brainstem level.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a common}} inflammatory disease of {{the central nervous system}} that results in persistent impairment in young adults. During chronic progressive disease stages, there is a strong correlation between neurodegeneration and disability. Current therapies fail to prevent progression of neurological impairment during these disease stages. <b>Flupirtine,</b> a drug approved for oral use in patients suffering from chronic pain, was used in a rat model of autoimmune optic neuritis and significantly increased the survival of retinal ganglion cells, the neurons that form the axons of the optic nerve. When <b>flupirtine</b> was combined with interferon-β, an established immunomodulatory therapy for MS, visual functions of the animals were improved during the acute phase of optic neuritis. Furthermore, <b>flupirtine</b> protected retinal ganglion cells from degeneration in a noninflammatory animal model of optic nerve transection. Although <b>flupirtine</b> was shown previously to increase neuronal survival by Bcl- 2 up-regulation, this mechanism does not appear {{to play a role in}} flupirtine-mediated protection of retinal ganglion cells either in vitro or in vivo. Instead, we showed through patch-clamp investigations that the activation of inwardly rectifying potassium channels is involved in flupirtine-mediated neuroprotection. Considering the few side effects reported in patients who receive long-term <b>flupirtine</b> treatment for chronic pain, our results indicate that this drug is an interesting candidate for further evaluation of its neuroprotective potential in MS...|$|E
40|$|Background {{and purpose}} : Voltage-gated {{potassium}} (K v) channels contribute to resting membrane potential in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and are down regulated {{in patients with}} pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and a contribution from K v 7 channels has been recently proposed. We investigated {{the effect of the}} K v 7 channel activator, <b>flupirtine,</b> on PAH in two independent mouse models: PAH induced by hypoxia and spontaneous PAH in mice over-expressing the 5 -HT transporter (SERT &# 43; mice). Experimental approach : Right ventricular pressure was assessed in vivo in mice chronically treated with <b>flupirtine</b> (30 mg&# 183;kg - 1 &# 183;day - 1). In separate in vitro experiments, pulmonary arteries from untreated mice were mounted in a wire myograph. Relaxations to acute administration of <b>flupirtine</b> and contractions to K v channel blocking drugs, including the K v 7 channel blocker linopirdine, were measured. Key results : In wild-type (WT) mice, hypoxia increased right ventricular pressure, pulmonary vascular remodelling and right ventricular hypertrophy. These effects were attenuated by <b>flupirtine,</b> which also attenuated these indices of PAH in SERTSERT &# 43; mice. In the in vitro experiments, <b>flupirtine</b> induced a potent relaxant response in arteries from untreated WT and SERTSERT &# 43; mice. The relaxation was fully reversed by linopirdine, which potently contracted mouse pulmonary arteries while other K v channel blockers did not. Conclusions and implications : <b>Flupirtine</b> significantly attenuated development of chronic hypoxia-induced PAH in mice and reversed established PAH in SERTSERT &# 43; mice, apparently via K v 7 channel activation.

Though many treatment modalities exist for postoperative pain management in orthopedic surgeries they are often accompanied by adverse effects. This study was carried out to assess the efficacy of <b>flupirtine</b> and piroxicam in postoperative pain reduction using visual analog scale (VAS) score. Materials and methods: An open-label, parallel group, comparative study was conducted on patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery, randomized into two groups of 38 patients each. They received either <b>flupirtine</b> 100 mg or piroxicam 20 mg 6 hours after surgery and then twice daily orally for 5 days. Pain was measured using VAS score, total pain relief score (TOTPAR 24), and patient satisfaction score (PSS); the other scales used were behavioral pain assessment scale (BPAS) and functional activity score (FAS). Rescue medication used was tramadol 100 mg intravenously. WHO causality scale was used for assessing adverse effects. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for assessment of various parameters. Results: A total of 76 patients with mean ± standard deviation age of 35. 08 ± 10. 3 years were recruited; 34 in the <b>flupirtine</b> and 37 in the piroxicam groups completed the study. Patients in both groups were comparable in baseline characteristics. <b>Flupirtine</b> and piroxicam reduced VAS score 48 hours postoperatively compared to baseline (p= 0. 006 and 0. 001) and piroxicam produced significant reduction in pain at 8, 12, and 120 hours compared to <b>flupirtine</b> (p= 0. 028, 0. 032, 0. 021).

40|$|Retigabine and <b>flupirtine</b> are two {{structurally}} related molecules provided of anticonvulsant and analgesic actions. The {{present study}} has investigated the neuroprotective potential, {{as well as}} the possible underlying molecular mechanisms, exerted by retigabine and <b>flupirtine</b> in rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) exposed to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), oxygen and glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation (OGD), or serum withdrawal (SW). Region-specific vulnerability of hippocampal subfields occurred with each of these injury models. Specifically, CA 1 was the most susceptible region to both NMDA and OGD-induced neurodegeneration, whereas selective cell death in the dentate gyrus (DG) occurred upon OHSCs exposure to SW. The NMDA antagonist MK- 801 (10 - 30 microM), despite blocking NMDA- and OGD-induced cell death, failed to prevent SW-induced neurodegeneration. Interestingly, retigabine (0. 01 - 10 microM) and <b>flupirtine</b> (0. 01 - 10 microM) dose-dependently prevented DG neuronal death induced by SW, with IC 50 s of 0. 4 microM and 0. 7 microM, respectively. By contrast, retigabine and <b>flupirtine</b> (each at 10 microM) were less effective in counteracting NMDA- or OGD-induced toxicity in the CA 1 region. Both retigabine and <b>flupirtine</b> (0. 1 - 10 microM) reduced SW-induced ROS production in the DG with IC 50 s of approximately 1 microM. This suggested that antioxidant actions of these compounds participated in OHSC neuroprotection during SW. By contrast, activation of KCNQ K+ channels seemed not to be involved in retigabine-induced OHSCs neuroprotection during SW, since linopirdine (20 microM) and XE- 991 (10 microM), two KCNQ blockers, failed to reverse retigabine-induced neuronal rescue...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>flupirtine</b> after {{a single}} oral dose of 100 mg {{have been studied}} in patients with moderate renal impairment and in healthy elderly subjects aged 66 - 83 years. Mean elimination half-life of <b>flupirtine</b> was higher in elderly patients than in younger normal subjects, and this was {{associated with an increased}} maximum serum concentration and reduced clearance. The mean half-life in patients with renal impairment was higher than in normal subjects. There was no correlation between observed elimination half-life and degree of renal impairment, but the creatinine clearance of most patients fell in a narrow range between 43 and 60 ml/min. In the light of these results and until further information is available, it would be prudent to start treatment of patients who are elderly or have evidence of renal impairment with half the dose of <b>flupirtine</b> recommended for younger patients with normal renal function...|$|E
40|$|Background. Multimodal {{analgesia}} {{is indicated}} for perioperative pain management to reduce opioid use {{and its associated}} adverse effects. NMDA receptor {{plays an important role}} in pain mechanism. Activation of K+ channel blocks the NMDA receptor mediated glutamate induced rise in intracellular Ca++ ion. Activation of K+ channel may increase inhibition of nociceptive input and improve pain relief. <b>flupirtine,</b> a selective K+ opener, has demonstrated efficacy in chronic pain conditions such as painful diabetic neuropathy and post-herpetic neuralgia. The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of <b>flupirtine</b> in reducing morphine requirements in patients after carcinoma breast surgery. Methods. Fifty patients received either two doses of oral <b>flupirtine</b> 100 mg (2 h before surgery and on first postoperative day) or placebo. All patients received patientcontrolled analgesia with morphine for 48 h after operation. Pain and adverse effects were assessed at 0. 5, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hrs after surgery on an 11 -point numeric rating scale...|$|E
40|$|Yanfang Liu, Hua Huo, Zhibo Zhao, Wenli Hu, Yujia Sun, Yunbiao Tang Technical Center for Clinical Pharmacy, Department of Drug Clinical Trail Management Agency, General Hospital of Shenyang Military Area Command, Shenyang, China Aim: This study {{developed}} a high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method to simultaneously determine {{the concentrations of}} <b>flupirtine</b> and its major active metabolite D- 13223 in human plasma {{in order to assess}} the bioequivalence (BE) of two <b>flupirtine</b> maleate capsules among healthy male Chinese volunteers under fasting and fed conditions. Materials and methods: There were two single-center, randomized, single-dose, open-label, laboratory-blinded, two-period, cross-over studies which included 24 healthy male Chinese volunteers under fasting and fed conditions, respectively. Plasma samples were collected prior to and up to 48  h after dosing. The concentrations of <b>flupirtine</b> and its major active metabolite D- 13223 in plasma samples were determined by a validated method, that is, high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a tandem mass spectrometry detector. Pharmacokinetic metrics of area from time zero to the last measurable concentration (AUC 0 -t), area under the plasma concentration–time curve from administration to infinite time (AUC 0 -∞), and Cmax were used for BE assessment. Results: Forty-eight healthy volunteers who met the criteria were enrolled and completed the study. According to the observation of vital signs and laboratory measurement, no volunteers had any adverse reactions. Under fasting condition, the geometric mean ratios (90 % CI) of the test/reference drug for <b>flupirtine</b> were 103. 0 % (98. 1 %– 108. 2 %) for AUC 0 -t, 102. 9 % (98. 2 %– 107. 9 %) for AUC 0 -∞, and 97. 0 % (85. 9 %– 109. 5 %) for Cmax. Under fed condition, the geometric mean ratios (90 % CI) of the test/reference drug for <b>flupirtine</b> were 101. 7 % (98. 4 %– 105. 1 %) for AUC 0 -t, 101. 6 % (98. 5 %– 104. 8 %) for AUC 0 -∞, and 103. 5 % (94. 7 %– 113. 0 %) for Cmax. The difference between test and reference formulations, Tmax, was not statistically significant. The 90 % CIs of the test/reference AUC ratio and Cmax ratio of D- 13223 were also within the acceptance range for BE both under fasting and fed conditions. Conclusion: The two formulations of <b>flupirtine</b> maleate capsule were bioequivalent (the test and the reference products) under fasting and fed conditions, and thus both can be used interchangeably in the clinical setting.
