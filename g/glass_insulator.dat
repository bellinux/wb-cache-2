50|$|Although many {{variations}} exist, a plasma lamp {{is usually}} a clear glass sphere filled {{with a mixture of}} various gases (most commonly neon, sometimes with other noble gases such as argon, xenon and krypton) at nearly atmospheric pressure. They are driven by high-frequency (approximately 35 kHz) alternating current at 2-5 kV. The drive circuit is essentially a specialized power inverter, in which current from a lower-voltage DC supply powers a high-frequency electronic oscillator circuit whose output is stepped up by a high-frequency, high-voltage transformer. The radio-frequency energy from the transformer is transmitted into the gas within the globe through an electrode at its center. A much smaller hollow glass orb can also serve as an electrode when it is filled with metal wool or a conducting fluid that is in communication with the transformer output. In this case, the radio-frequency energy is admitted into the larger space by capacitive coupling right through the glass. Plasma filaments extend from the inner electrode to the outer <b>glass</b> <b>insulator,</b> giving the appearance of moving tendrils of colored light within the volume of the globe (see corona discharge and electric glow discharge).|$|E

This studied case considers the voltage applied on <b>glass</b> <b>insulators</b> used in a chain of six elements of a 69 kV power line. When submitted to high voltage, the insulators radiate radio frequency signals up to frequencies of some GHz. In this frequency range the signal can be detected using portable antennas, and then be applied to post processing. These received spectra are analyzed by statistical methods, mean and standard deviation, and the cross relation between them is used to classify the pollution level in insulators. To reduce complexity and cost a simple data processing using the mean and the standard deviation are used. Two types of <b>glass</b> <b>insulators</b> are considered: clean or polluted, and to cover the entire frequency range from 30 MHz to 1 GHz two types of antennas were needed.

40|$|Perhaps {{no single}} area of {{insulator}} behavior has fascinated researchers {{more so than}} predicting flashover under contaminated conditions. For traditional porcelain and <b>glass</b> <b>insulators,</b> {{there is a large}} body of literature published that includes both theoretical models and experimental tests to simulate this interesting and practically important aspect of insulator performance. Yet there still some critical gaps in the understanding of this complex problem. This article summarizes {{the state of the art}} for porcelain and <b>glass</b> <b>insulators,</b> which are still the workhorses of industry. In such insulators, the dielectric being inorganic, there is no interaction of the surface with the contamination layer on the surface. We know that with nonceramic (composite) insulators, there is an interaction (for example, hydrophobic recovery), which further complicates the flashover process. Needless to say, we understand even less about the flashover process on nonceramic insulators. It is therefore important that this subject be researched further from the point of view of obtaining reliable performance from both ceramic and nonceramic insulators. The earliest scientific explanations for contamination flashover was the theory proposed by Obenaus in the 1930 s [1]. He explained flashover in very simple terms with the schematic shown in Fig. 1. A partial arc generated by dry band activity is in series with the contaminate...|$|R
40|$|During service, {{overhead}} {{transmission line}} insulators lose their functionality due to electrical stresses and environmental conditions causing incessant flow of leakage current (LC) on their surface thereby leading to <b>insulator</b> ageing. Ceramic <b>glass</b> <b>insulators</b> are the oldest type of insulator and constitute a bulk number with some operating for decades and approaching their projected life span. A technique to assess the condition of these ageing insulators on-line or predict their remaining life span has till date not yet been possible.

In this work, field-aged transmission line <b>glass</b> <b>insulators</b> that have exhibited severe, mild and no degree of ageing with service history ranging from 0 â€“ 40 years were studied. The frequency components of the insulator LC were investigated under different electrical stresses and contamination level.

In addition, a pattern existed between the LC harmonics distribution of various aged insulators samples.
