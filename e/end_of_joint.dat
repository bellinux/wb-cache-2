5000|$|On June 20, 1632 Charles I of England (ignoring Native American land claims) gave 12000000 acre of land {{covering}} {{most of what}} is now {{the modern}} U.S. state of Maryland to Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore as a proprietary colony. The charter had originally been granted to Calvert's father, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, but the 1st Baron Baltimore died before it could be executed, so it was granted to his son instead. On September 4, 1663, a land patent was issued to Thomas Dent, Sr. for a tract known as [...] "Gisbrough". This tract was roughly in the area that is now Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling between Malcolm X Avenue SE/MacDill Boulevard SE and Giavannoli Street SW, the northern end of Bellevue, and the southern end of Congress Heights.

40|$|Abstract. For {{orthotropic}} {{steel bridge}} deck (OSD), principle tensile stresses near the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> of crossbeam web and longitudinal rib {{and at the}} edge of crossbeam cutout are dependent on the shape of crossbeam cutout to a great extent. They are results of many factors, among which bending-shearing effect and in-plane supporting effect are in-plane factors, unsymmetrical loading effect and relative longitudinal deformation effect are out-of-plane factors. Comparison study on stresses at some fatigue sensitive regions of orthotropic steel deck with six types of crossbeam web cutout indicates that the top height of cutouts determines the distance between the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> and the neutral axis, which affects the bending effect seriously, and the area of cutouts determines the shearing effect. When OSD system is affected by bending-shearing effect, increasing the top height decreases the principle tensile stresses near the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> but increases the stresses {{at the edge of}} cutout, and increasing the area increases the principle tensile stresses both near the end and at the edge of cutout. When the top height of cutouts increases, the contact area between crossbeam web drops, then the principle tensile stresses near the joint produced by in-plane supporting effect increases. When the side width of cutouts increases, the constraint effect of the crossbeam web to longitudinal rib decreases, then the principle tensile stresses near the joint produced by out-of-plane effects decreases. Generally, OSD system with stiff cutouts behaves well when affected by in-plane effects, and OSD system with flexible cutouts behaves well when affected by out-of-plane effects...|$|E
30|$|In {{recent decades}} adhesively bonded joints gained {{attention}} in many {{industries such as}} automotive, aeronautics and offshore, increasing structural mechanical repair services and thus promoting technological advances.

40|$|A {{method to}} predict the {{ultimate}} strength of adhesive joints has been evaluated for the quasi-static loading {{of a variety of}} cracked-lap shear (CLS) and single-lap shear (SLS) joints bonded with a high-strength, toughened epoxy adhesive. The adhesive strength was experimentally characterized in terms of the steady-state critical strain energy release rate, Gcs, {{as a function of the}} loading phase angle, using double cantilever beam (DCB) joints. Comparing the calculated energy release rate using the J-integral with the Gcs at the corresponding phase angle, the ultimate failure load in the fracture joint was predicted and compared with experimental results. When the toughening of the adhesive during subcritical crack growth (i. e. its R-curve behavior) was considered in the analysis, good agreement between the predicted and experimental failure loads was achieved, both for joints made with aluminum or steel adherends. The initial condition at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> overlap (fillet or precrack) did not affect the ultimate joint strength because of the significant amount of subcritical crack growth.

This paper presents {{an investigation of}} the use of a cohesive zone model in predicting the strong effects of stress concentration due to varying adherend thickness on the pull-off strength measured by the Pneumatic Adhesion Tensile Testing Instrument. A comparison is made with the point-strain-at-a-distance criterion, where the plastic deformation of the adhesive is analysed using a modified Drucker-Prager/cap plasticity material model. The fracture properties of the cohesive zone model were determined using double-cantilever and end-notch flexural specimens, and the cohesive strengths were measured using tensile and lap shear tests. Comparisons with experimental results reveal that the cohesive zone model with perfectly plastic (or non-strain-softening) cohesive law provides accurate predictions <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> strengths...|$|R
