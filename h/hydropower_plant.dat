5|$|This trend {{continued}} {{and increases in}} the production of hydroelectric power are directly related to industrial development. In 2005, Landsvirkjun produced 7,143 GWh of electricity total of which 6,676 GWh or 93% was produced via hydroelectric power plants. Additionally 5,193 GWh or 72% was used for power-intensive industries like aluminum smelting. In 2009 Iceland built its biggest hydroelectric project to date, a 690 MW hydroelectric plant to provide energy for another aluminum smelter — the Kárahnjúkar <b>Hydropower</b> <b>Plant.</b> This project was opposed strongly by environmentalists.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>hydropower</b> <b>plant</b> {{was built}} in 1904 by a local entrepreneur. It was located {{in a small town}} outside of Reykjavík and {{produced}} 9 kW of power. The first municipal hydroelectric plant {{was built in}} 1921, and it could produce 1 MW of power. This plant single-handedly quadrupled the amount of electricity in the country. The 1950s marked the next evolution in hydroelectric plants. Two plants were built on the Sog River, one in 1953 which produced 31 MW, and the other in 1959 which produced 26.4 MW. These two plants were the first built for industrial purposes and they were co-owned by the Icelandic government. This process continued in 1965 when the national power company, Landsvirkjun, was founded. It was owned by both the Icelandic government and the municipality of Reykjavík. In 1969, they built a 210 MW plant on the Þjórsá River that would supply the southeastern area of Iceland with electricity and run an aluminum smelting plant that could produce 33,000tons of aluminum a year.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s, {{thermoelectric}} {{generation has}} come to lead a system that was dominated by hydropower: <b>Hydropower</b> <b>plant</b> capacity has gone from 90 percent to only 30 percent. The reasons for this shift are twofold. First, hydroelectric development became more expensive when funding through interest-free loans for its development from International financial institutions was cut. Second, the lower risks and shorter maturity of thermal generation projects, as perceived by private investors, directed generation expansion towards the use of heavy fuel oil and medium speed diesels.|$|E

25|$|Brazil {{was faced}} {{with one of the}} most serious energy crises in its history in 2001-2002. The crisis was the direct result of a {{sequence}} of a few years drier than average in a country with over 80% of hydroelectric generation capacity. Additionally, several delays in the commissioning of new generation plants and transmission problems in the third circuit from the Itaipu <b>hydropower</b> <b>plant</b> accounted for a third of the energy deficit.

25|$|Generation {{capacity}} in Brazil {{is dominated by}} hydroelectric plants, which account for 77% of total installed capacity, with 24 plants above 1,000 MW. About 88 percent of the electricity fed into the national grid is estimated to come from hydroelectric generation, with over 25% coming from a single <b>hydropower</b> <b>plant,</b> the massive 14 GW Itaipu dam facility, located between Brazil and Paraguay on the Paraná River.

25|$|In December 2007, 33,678 people (13.5% of {{the total}} population) living in Iceland had been born abroad, {{including}} children of Icelandic parents living abroad. Around 19,000 people (6% of the population) held foreign citizenship. Polish people make up the largest minority group by a considerable margin, and still form {{the bulk of the}} foreign workforce. About 8,000 Poles now live in Iceland, 1,500 of them in Fjarðabyggð where they make up 75% of the workforce who are constructing the Fjarðarál aluminium plant. The recent increase in immigration has been credited to a labour shortage due to the booming economy at the time, {{as well as to the}} lifting of restrictions on the movement of people from the countries that were a part of the 2004 enlargement of the European Union. Large-scale construction projects in the east of Iceland (see Kárahnjúkar <b>Hydropower</b> <b>Plant)</b> have also brought in many people whose stay is expected to be temporary. Many Polish immigrants were also considering leaving in 2008 as a result of the Icelandic financial crisis.|$|E

25|$|He {{introduced}} and inaugurated several large-scale projects {{to stimulate the}} economy, such as the Ghazie-Barotah <b>Hydropower</b> <b>plant.</b> However, unemployment remained a challenge, therefore Sharif imported thousands of privatised Yellow-cab taxis to many young Pakistanis, but this program came at a cost. Few of the loans were repaid {{by the government and}} Sharif found it difficult to privatise these taxis at low rate, since the young and poor could not afford at higher price. However, Sharif indeed privatised these taxis at low rate and his steel industry was forced to pay the remaining cost. During his first and second term, Sharif intensified his policies of industrialisation and privatisation of major industries that were nationalised by former Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Undoing what was previously done in the 1970s remained a challenge for Sharif but, despite the economical slow down, Sharif reverted major policies of Bhutto and under short span of time, 90% of the industries were industrialised and privatised by him. This radical move had a positive impact on country's economy and the economy progressed at an appropriate level. Sharif policies were also continued by Benazir Bhutto, who nationalised only those industries that needed a government bail out plan, and by Pervez Musharraf and Shaukat Aziz in the 2000s who managed to privatised all of the major industries by the end his term in 2008.|$|E
