5000|$|The Paraho {{process can}} be {{operated}} in two different heating modes, which are direct and indirect. [...] The Paraho Direct process evolved from gas combustion retort technology and is classified as an internal combustion method. [...] Accordingly, the Paraho Direct retort is a vertical shaft retort similar to the Kiviter and Fushun retorts, used correspondingly in Estonia and China. [...] However, compared to the earlier gas combustion retorts the Paraho retort's raw oil shale feeding mechanism, gas distributor, and <b>discharge</b> <b>grate</b> have different designs. In the Paraho Direct process, the crushed and screened raw oil shale is fed {{into the top of}} the retort through a rotating distributor. The oil shale descends the retort as a moving bed. [...] The oil shale is heated by the rising combustion gases from {{the lower part of the}} retort and the kerogen in the shale decomposes at about [...] to oil vapour, shale oil gas and spent shale. Heat for pyrolysis comes from the combustion of char in the spent shale. The combustion takes place where air is injected at two levels in the middle of the retort below the pyrolysis section raising the temperature of the shale and the gas to [...] to [...] [...] Collecting tubes at the top of the retort carry shale oil mist, evolved gases and combustion gases into the product separation unit, where oil, water and dust are separated from the gases. For combined removal of liquid droplets and particulates, a wet electrostatic precipitator is used. Cleaned gases from the precipitator are compressed in a compressor. Part of the gas from the compressor is recycled to the bottom of the retort to cool the combusted shale (shale ash) and carry the recovered heat back up the retort. Cooled shale ash exits the retort through the <b>discharge</b> <b>grate</b> in the bottom of the retort. After processing, shale ash is disposed of. The liquid oil is separated from produced water and may be further refined into high quality products. The mixture of evolved gases and combustions gases is available for use as a low quality fuel gas for drying or power generation.|$|E
40|$|Pulp lifters, also known, as pan lifters are an {{integral}} part of the majority of autogenous (AG), semi-autogenous (SAG) and grate discharge ball mills. The performance of the pulp lifters in conjunction with grate design determines the ultimate flow capacity of these mills. Although the function of the pulp lifters is simply to transport the slurry passed through the <b>discharge</b> <b>grate</b> into the discharge trunnion, their performance depends on their design as well as that of the grate and operating conditions such as mill speed and charge level. However, little or no work has been reported on the performance of grate-pulp lifter assemblies and in particular the influence of pulp lifter design on slurry transport. Ideally, the discharge rate through a grate-pulp lifter assembly should be equal to the discharge rate through at a given mill hold-up. However, the results obtained have shown that conventional pulp lifter designs cause considerable restrictions to flow resulting in reduced flow capacity. In this second of a two-part series of papers the performance of conventional pulp lifters (radial and spiral designs) is described and is based on extensive test work carried out in a I m diameter pilot SAG mill.

40|$|The best {{accepted}} {{method for}} design of autogenous and semi-autogenous (AG/SAG) mills is {{to carry out}} pilot scale test work using a 1. 8 m diameter by 0. 6 m long pilot scale test mill. The load in such a mill typically contains 250, 000 - 450, 000 particles larger than 6 mm, allowing correct representation of more than 90 % of the charge in Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations. Most AG/SAG mills use <b>discharge</b> <b>grate</b> slots which are 15 mm or more in width. The mass in each size fraction usually decreases rapidly below grate size. This scale of DEM model is now within the possible range of standard workstations running an efficient DEM code. This paper describes various ways of extracting collision data front the DEM model and translating it into breakage estimates. Account is taken of the different breakage mechanisms (impact and abrasion) and of the specific impact histories of the particles {{in order to assess}} the breakage rates for various size fractions in the mills. At some future time, the integration of smoothed particle hydrodynamics with DEM will allow for the inclusion of slurry within the pilot mill simulation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Since their {{colonization}} of the Great Lakes, they have covered the undersides of docks, boats, and anchors. They have also spread into {{streams and rivers}} throughout the US. In some areas they completely cover the substrate, sometimes covering other freshwater mussels. They can grow so densely that they block pipelines, clogging water intakes of municipal water supplies and hydroelectric companies. Zebra mussels do not attach to cupronickel alloys, {{which can be used}} to coat intake and <b>discharge</b> <b>grates,</b> navigational buoys, boats, and motors where the species tends to congregate.|$|R
40|$|Slurry flow, {{including}} {{flow through}} the charge in the grinding chamber, through the <b>discharge</b> <b>grates,</b> along the pulp lifters and its discharge from the mill is an important contributor to {{the efficiency of the}} grinding process within a SAG mill. Poor transport of finer ground material can adversely affect grinding leading to excess energy consumption and over-grinding of fine material. This paper uses a 1 -way coupled DEM-SPH method in three dimensions to analyse the full slurry flow for a 1. 8 m diameter by 0. 6 m long AG/SAG pilot mill. This provides detailed information on the internal flow of slurry within a SAG mill, including the prediction of dry regions and of slurry pooling. The importance of the end walls in generating complex three dimensional recirculation patterns in the charge and its influence on axial flow is demonstrated. Such a full 3 D analysis ensures that the slurry is presented to the grate with a realistic spatial distribution and allows prediction of the {{flow through the}} grates and then within the pulp chamber. The rate of filling of the pulp chambers, the point of initiation of flow down along the rising pulp lifters, back flow into the grinding chamber and flow onto the discharge cone are all investigated. It is shown that the end wall lifters are critical to the flow through the grate generating pumping and shadowing effects which produce strongly non-uniform flow through different grate panels...|$|R
50|$|Sepro Tyre Driven Grinding Mills are {{designed}} for small and medium capacity grinding applications, specifically small tonnage plants, regrinding mills, reagent prep and lime slaking. Sepro Pneumatic Tyre Driven (PTD) mills provide an alternative to standard trunnion drive systems. The drive consists of multiple gears boxes and electric motors directly connected and controlled through an AC variable frequency drive. Shell supported mills such as the Sepro PTD mills minimize stress on the mill shell by spreading the power drive over {{the full length of}} the mill. Sepro Mills are suitable for Ball, Rod and Pebble charges and are available with overflow or <b>grate</b> <b>discharge</b> to suit the application. Shell supported Mills such as the Sepro PTD Grinding Mills minimize stress on the shell by spreading the power drive over the full length of the unit.|$|R
40|$|Discharge grates play an {{important}} role in determining the performance of autogenous, semi-autogenous and grate discharge ball mills. The flow capacity (grinding capacity) of these mills is strongly influenced by the <b>discharge</b> <b>grate</b> design-open area and position of apertures, as well as the performance of the pulp lifters. As mill sizes have progressively increased and closed-circuiting has become more popular the importance of grate and pulp lifter design has grown. Unfortunately very few studies have concentrated on this aspect of mill performance. To remedy this a series of laboratory and pilot-scale tests were undertaken to study both the performance of grates on their own and in conjunction with pulp lifters. In this first paper of a two-part series the results from the grate-only experiments are presented and discussed, whilst the performance of the grate-pulp-lifter system is covered in the second paper. The results from the grate-only experiments have shown that the build-up of slurry (hold-up) inside the mill starts from the shoulder of the charge, while the toe position of the slurry progressively moves towards the toe of the charge with increasing flowrate. Besides grate design (open area and position of apertures), charge volume and mill speed were also found to have a strong influence on mill hold-up and interact with grate design variables.

40|$|Although pulp lifters are an {{integral}} part of the majority of <b>grate</b> <b>discharge</b> grinding mills, the potential problems imposed due to their improper design have only come to light in recent years. Ideally, at a particular mill hold-up, the discharge rate through a grate-only assembly should be matched by the capacity of the pulp lifters. Recent industrial experience has suggested that this is not always the case and can lead to a dramatic reduction in mill capacity. A research program was therefore initiated at the JKMRC to study this aspect of mill operation. This paper presents the results obtained to date from experiments carried out in a laboratory SAG mill with grate-only as well as grate and pulp lifter arrangements. Scale models of industrial pulp lifter designs were used. The results illustrate the influence of pulp lifter chamber volume and show that over a wide range of values, the discharge capacity of the pulp lifter assembly was always less than that of a grate-only configuration. The cause of this problem is explained together with comparisions of different pulp lifter designs...|$|R
40|$|The {{difficulties}} {{associated with}} slurry transportation in autogenous (ag) and semi-autogenous (sag) grinding mills {{have become more}} apparent in recent years with the increasing trend to build larger diameter mills for grinding high tonnages. This is particularly noticeable when ag/sag mills are run in closed circuit with classifiers such as fine screens/cyclones. Extensive test work carried out on slurry removal mechanism in <b>grate</b> <b>discharge</b> mills (ag/sag) {{has shown that the}} conventional pulp lifters (radial and curved) have inherent drawbacks. They allow short-circuiting of the slurry from pulp lifters into the grinding chamber leading to slurry pool formation. Slurry pool absorbs part of the impact thus inhibiting the grinding process. Twin Chamber Pulp Lifter (TCPL) - an efficient design of pulp lifter developed by the authors overcomes the inherent drawbacks of the conventional pulp lifters. Extensive testing in both laboratory and pilot scale mills has shown that the TCPL completely blocks the flow-back process, thus allowing the mill to operate close to their design flow capacity. The TCPL performance is also found to be independent of variations in charge volume and grate design, whereas they significantly affect the performance of conventional pulp lifters (radial and curved).

40|$|AbstractBall mills {{are used}} for {{grinding}} of rocks, cement clinker and limestone from 10 to 100 mm feed sizes down to sub-millimetre product. They are typically rotating cylinders with diameters from 3 to 6 m and lengths from 6 to 12 m. The flow of particulate solids within these mills can be modelled using the discrete element method (DEM). Typically, such modelling is done for short durations of a few mill revolutions and either in two dimensions or using thin three-dimensional slices {{through the center of}} the mill with periodic boundary conditions in the axial direction. This facilitates an understanding of the radial motion of the charge, estimation of power draw and of liner wear, but it cannot provide information about axial transport within the mill. In this paper, we examine the axial transport in dry ball mills. This requires simulation of the entire mill and the full volume of the charge for significant periods of time (thousands of revolutions). We use a simple model for <b>grate</b> <b>discharge</b> that allows prediction of the time varying axial distribution of different particle sizes within a discharging ball mill. The distributions of sub-grate size ‘fines’ is shown to satisfy a one-dimensional diffusion equation with the diffusion coefficient decreasing with grate size. A pulse test, where a single mass of fines in injected at the feed end, is able to quantify the residence time distribution of the fines...|$|R
40|$|In mineral {{processing}} industries, grinding processes {{can be defined}} as the particles reduced in size by a combination of impact and abrasion. It is performed in tumbling mills that describe a class of mills delimited by a cylindrical chamber filled with balls and/or rock that rotate around its longitudinal axis. Tumbling mills, whether they are autogenous, semi-autogenous, ball or rod, are classed according {{to the nature of the}} discharge as centre peripheral discharge mills, end peripheral discharge mills, overflow mills, and <b>grate</b> <b>discharge</b> mills. These mills are used in at least three industries: mining, cement and metal powders industries to grind different materials (ore, clinker and metal powder) to desired quality specifications as principally described by a size distribution. These tumbling mills range in size from small 0. 3 m diameter lab mills to a 16 m diameter semi-autogenous industrial mill and are driven by chain and sprocket (lab mills), gear and pinion (pilot and industrial scale mills) and gearless drives in very large diameter mill (8 to 12 m dia.). All of these mill drives present advantages and limitations. In this thesis, we focus on the design and development of a cam-driven laboratory ball mill. An alternative drive system is presented that uses a newly patented speed-o-cam technology and applies it to a 5 ft diameter lab mill. We introduce polynomials to modify the cam profile around both the cusp and the blunt point of the profile to improve pressure angle and shock impact. We build models of mechanical systems, simulate the full-motion behavior of the models, and analyze multiple design variations. We integrate the theoretical, virtual and experimental analyses in order to design an optimal mechanical system. Moreover, the analysis of static and dynamic forces of cam mechanism is reported in the thesis...|$|R
