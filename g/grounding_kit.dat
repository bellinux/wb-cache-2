50|$|The clamps of the <b>grounding</b> <b>kits</b> / {{earthing}} kits {{are composed}} of an ozone- and UV-resistant rubber coat with a device where the ripple can be lodged. The tin-plated ripple with a special alloying enables the bridging over big tolerances between kit and coaxial cable which is important for a best possible voltage transmission. The ripple to the skinned coaxial cable has a low contact resistance between 0.10 to 0.15 mΩ. It also enables a better length compensation as well as even and low contact pressures, which avoids damages on the coaxial cable. These characteristics are known as relaxation behaviour.|$|R

40|$|The mission {{statement}} of the School of Dentistry, The University of Queensland, highlights research as a priority. Whilst undergraduate research is encouraged, first and second year students in dentistry and oral health are not exposed to research within their curricula. This study evaluated the effectiveness of embedding a community-integrated research project into {{the first and second}} year undergraduate curricula. The project required 96 first year oral health and dentistry students, and 24 second year oral health students to form their own research groups. Each group conducted questionnaire-based interviews to document differences in oral health beliefs and oral hygiene practices among an oral health or health professional group. Findings from each group were presented orally as part of the formal assessment. Data was obtained via a structured student experience questionnaire, student peer evaluations and student assessment marks. Most students rated this project as good (mean overall rating = 4 / 5) and agreed that the project enhanced their understanding, interest and appreciation of research, enriched student learning and professional development. Summative assessments gave mean student marks greater than 82 % and 77 % in first and second year cohorts, respectively. This community-integrated research project was effective in engaging students in research, in enhancing their research interest and in developing research and professional skills. © Common <b>Ground,</b> Annetta <b>Kit</b> Lam Tsang...|$|R

5000|$|In 1990, all Daytonas {{received}} an interior restyling, featuring a more modern-feeling cockpit style wraparound dashboard. Also in 1990, a Variable Nozzle Turbocharger (VNT Turbo IV) borrowed from Shelby's 1989 vnt csx, was {{offered in the}} Shelby model producing the same [...] as the Turbo II but, it eliminated turbo lag and improved driveability. Also for 1990 a 3.0 L SOHC V6 from Mitsubishi was made available, {{as well as a}} redesigned interior {{similar to that of the}} Chrysler LeBaron coupe and convertible. In addition, 1990 saw the introduction of a standard driver's side airbag to the Daytona. This was in keeping with Chrysler's decision to offer a driver's side airbags across most models. In 1991, the 2.2 liter turbo was dropped in favor of the new 2.5L [...] "High Torque Turbo." [...] Although sporting a lesser 152 hp, this power-plant offered 210 ft. lbs. of torque, exceeding that of the Turbo II. Also new was the addition of an IROC model with either the 3.0 v6 or the turbocharged 2.5 L engine. Visually, Iroc models differed from lesser models, having a <b>ground</b> effects <b>kit</b> and alloy wheels, among other differences. The Iroc Decals where added in halfway through 1991 even though all Shelby Daytona's from 1991 where considered to be an [...] "IROC", which could be revealed if one looked up their VIN # online. There are no difference between a 91 Shelby and Iroc besides the decals and the J in the vin sequence. On 1991 model Daytona Shelbys the vin had the sequence `G74J` and the Iroc's had the sequence G743. Over the years people have added the wrong shelby or iroc decals to their cars, one way to correct this is to check the vin sequence to determine what model it is.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, {{as part of}} Mayor Michael Bloomberg's {{gun control}} efforts, the city {{approved}} new legislation regulating handgun possession and sales. The new laws established a gun offender registry, required city gun dealers to inspect their inventories and file reports to the police twice a year, and limited individual handgun purchases to once every 90 days. The regulations also banned the use and sale of kits used to paint guns in bright or fluorescent colors, on the <b>grounds</b> that such <b>kits</b> {{could be used to}} disguise real guns as toys.

40|$|Schools in Europe {{actively}} {{participated in}} the educational project "Spaceship Earth", part of ESA astronaut André Kuipers’ PromISSe mission. The initiative, conceptualized by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Netherlands Space Office (NSO) also involved a unique collaboration of a team including NEMO Science Centre (Amsterdam, NL), Space Expo (Noordwijk, NL),World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the University of Amsterdam and the Vu-University of Amsterdam. André Kuipers launched from Baikonur to the ISS on 21 December 2011. By asking students aged 10 - 14 to ‘Join my mission’, he invited {{them to participate in}} "Spaceship Earth" or "Ruimteschip Aarde" (the Dutch version of "Spaceship Earth" specially targeting Dutch primary schools). Pupils were directly involved in this mission by following lessons developed by ESA and Science Center NEMO for the three Spaceship Earth themes: ‘Life’, ‘Biodiversity’ and ‘Weather and Climate’. Additionally the Spaceship Earth programme was represented in a longstanding exhibition in Space Expo, ESA’s Teacher Summer Workshop and the ESA Space Camp. A major part of Spaceship Earth project allowed students to compare results of experiments in the classroom with the results carried out by André in microgravity. To fulfil this objective, space hardware and <b>ground</b> demonstration <b>kits</b> were developed and delivered free of charge to schools that signed up to participate in the experiment. These kits enabled students to appreciate the role of gravity in the phenomena of convection and foam formation/stability. In addition, a direct interaction between the astronaut and the children during an inflight call allowed for a more direct contact to discuss the results both sets of experiments achieved - truly bringing the classroom into space. The NSO further tailored their Ruimteschip Aarde national programme by involving Dutch Schooltv and by maintaining a dedicated project website, where André challenged Dutch children with three specific problem solving tasks. The children submitted their solutions via short video clip or photo-shoot after which André selected the winners whilst in space. The teams with the best solution won a radio contact (ARISS) with the astronaut. The goals of the project were to make pupils, teachers and those in their social environment, aware of the conditions necessary for life and the systems that support these, both on Earth and the ISS. Furthermore the project was a tool to enhance interest in science and technology, bring attention to the importance of space exploration as well as highlight the beauty and vulnerability of planet Earth...|$|R

Aesthetically little changed from the other models other than a <b>ground</b> effects <b>kit</b> and taller rear spoiler. In 2000 a 4-door Z24 Sedan debuted, featuring the same mechanics but having a less sporty body. The Z24 trim also received several other upgrades including a wider front sway bar and FE2 Sports Suspension for better handling characteristics, and less aggressive ABS anti-lock braking system. In 2001, the 3-speed automatic was dropped from the base models equipped with the 2.2-L, and the 4-speed automatic became the main offering across the entire lineup, with 5-speed still available in the 2-door cars. Also, the RS was replaced by the LS Sport line, which featured the new Ecotec L61 motors ( [...] and 150 lbft Nm torque). These engines improved fuel economy, featuring the same displacement as the GM 122 Pushrod Engine (2.2 L OHV) while maintaining most {{of the power of the}} older LD9 motors.

Both his parents played cricket: his father for Westland Sports Club while his mother captained a nursing services team at Sherborne. Ian developed an eagerness for the game before he had started school: he would climb through the fence of the Yeovil Boys' Grammar School to watch the pupils play cricket. At the age of around four, he came home with a cricket ball and asked his mother [...] "Do you know how to hold a ball when you're going to bowl a daisy-cutter?"
