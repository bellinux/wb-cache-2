And <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> just to look at benefits; equal attention needs to be paid to costs, both the direct costs of the action under consideration but also the opportunity cost – that <b>is,</b> what will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> undertaken, because this program is undertaken.|$|R

25|$|The electoral {{district}} {{was created in}} 1952 from the former districts of Brandon and Souris. It has been held by a centre-right party for all but one term of its existence. This tradition was broken in 1993 when massive vote-splitting between the Progressive Conservatives and Reform allowed the Liberals to sneak up the middle and take the riding. However, the seat reverted to form in 1997 when the PCs reclaimed it. The PCs and their successors, the modern Conservatives, have held the seat ever since. While Brandon has some Liberal and NDP support, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> overcome the conservative bent in the more rural areas of the riding.|$|E

25|$|Between times 1 to 2 is {{termed the}} {{acquisition}} period. Between times 2 to 3 is termed the incubation period (1982: 520). Further, {{he states that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> consider only the time that has passed between 2 and 3 to make statements about attrition. It is also necessary to consider the duration, relative success, {{and nature of the}} acquisition period and the duration and content of the incubation phase (Gardner 1982: 520). The acquisition period is the time where language learning or language experience occurs, mainly from the first to the last lesson. During the incubation period, no language training or language usage occurs and the forgetting may begin. He says that now that language learning is not active anymore, a study about language attrition can be conducted (Gardner 1982a: 2).|$|E
25|$|Riot {{shotguns}} {{are also}} more limited in range than combat shotguns {{by the nature of}} their use. A combat shotgun is considered effective out to 75 yards (70 m) because on average at least 1 pellet of a 9 pellet 00 buckshot load will hit a human sized target at that range. This is enough to degrade the combat effectiveness of an enemy soldier, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> reliably disable an assailant in a defensive situation. For that, there must be multiple hits to the target, enough that one or more pellets will hit a vital region. Generally this is well under 27 yards (25 meters) with a cylinder bore barrel. Beyond this range, slugs and good iron sights are recommended, extending the range to over 109 yards (100 meters).|$|E

[...] After all, {{the form of a}} narrative is determined by its content. It is Sarah Woodruff [...] "the content of whose character produces multiple and contradictory possibilities" [...] for the narrative.|$|E

500|$|For artistic pursuits, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> promote {{such things}} generally, {{as it is}} too vague. A body for {{specific}} artistic purposes may be charitable, as in Royal Choral Society v IRC, as is the promotion of a particular composer, seen in Re Delius. For a gift to be charitable, the courts must be convinced that the subject of advancement be of artistic merit. This includes famous composers, as seen above, and social graces, as in Re Shaw's Wills Trust. When there is doubt, the courts ignore {{the opinions of the}} beneficiary and instead rely on experts, as in Re Pinion. This area is covered by the Charities Act 2006, which lists [...] "the advancement of citizenship or community development" [...] and [...] "the advancement of the arts, culture, heritage or science" [...] as valid types of charitable trust.|$|E
500|$|After the result's announcement, President Josipović {{commented that}} the day was of great {{significance}} to Croatia, defining the nation as one with a European future. Prime Minister Milanović welcomed the decision as historic and as the first such decision made by Croatians alone; {{he also said that}} the referendum represented a turning point for Croatia. Croatian Parliament Speaker Boris Šprem said that a new chapter of Croatian history and better fortune for the nation was dawning. The Croatian Minister of the Economy, Radimir Čačić, concluded that Croatia's credit rating would have been downgraded if the referendum had not passed. He also stated that, since the referendum passed, it was a good opportunity to upgrade the rating. Minister of Finance Slavko Linić stated that he was pleased with the result, but not with the voter turnout. He disagreed with Čačić that the credit rating could be saved by this result, since everybody had already counted on Croatian entry to the EU. Foreign and European Affairs Minister Vesna Pusić {{commented that the}} result was good news for Europe, which faced internal problems. Former Speaker Vladimir Šeks said that the low turnout was caused by external factors– the debt crisis in Europe and a loss of confidence in Croatian political parties and institutions. Luka Bebić, also a former speaker of the Parliament, added that it was good that Croats had voted to join the EU. Former Croatian foreign minister Gordan Jandroković commented that the result is especially important for the nation's youth, and former Croatian President Stjepan Mesić stated that Croatia should be competitive and use EU funds, adding that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be happy with entering the EU. He also commented on claims that joining the EU was tantamount to entering a new Yugoslavia, saying that [...] "only idiots think that Yugoslavia should be renewed".|$|E

2500|$|The {{religious}} revival {{known as}} the [...] Great Awakening reached Virginia when Henry was a child. His father was staunchly Anglican, but his mother often took him to hear Presbyterian preachers. Although Henry remained a lifelong Anglican communicant, ministers such as Samuel Davies taught him that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> save one's own soul, but one should help to save society. He also learned that oratory should reach the heart, not just persuade based on reason. His oratorical technique would follow that of these preachers, seeking to reach the people by speaking to them in their own language.|$|E

2500|$|According to Walter Kaufmann, {{the basic}} idea of Hegel's works, {{especially}} the Phenomenology of Spirit, is that a philosopher should not [...] "confine him or herself to views that have been held but penetrate these to the human reality they reflect." [...] In other words, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> consider propositions, or even the content of consciousness; [...] "it is worthwhile to ask in every instance what kind of spirit would entertain such propositions, hold such views, and have such a consciousness. Every outlook in other words, is to be studied not merely as an academic possibility but as an existential reality." [...] Walter Kaufmann has argued that as unlikely as it may sound, {{it is not the}} case that Hegel was unable to write clearly, but that Hegel felt that [...] "he must and should not write {{in the way in which}} he was gifted." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Everybody is {{born to be}} a genius. If a child's talent cannot blossom the way it should, {{that is not the}} child's fault, but {{the school}} system and the {{environment}} he lives in. The responsibility of the parent is tiny, because most parents have never been trained to be teachers. When something is wrong with our car, our watch or our house, we call a professional to fix it. No one wants to repair these himself. In modern society, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> love the children. No seed will become a flower just because it gets love. It also needs professional care and nursing to bloom. So if we do not nurse and protect the child's talent, he will become a gloomy adult and the whole world will be poorer. The true values of a nation are in the souls and minds of its people, not in the vaults of the National Bank." ...|$|E
2500|$|Particles {{that are}} {{produced}} in accelerators {{must also be}} observed, {{and this is the}} task of particle detectors. While interesting phenomena may occur when protons collide <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> just produce them. Particle detectors must be built to detect particles, their masses, momentum, energies, lifetime, charges, and nuclear spins. In order to identify all particles produced at the interaction point where the particle beams collide, particle detectors are usually designed in layers like an onion. The layers are made up of detectors of different types, each of which is designed to observe specific types of particles. [...] The different traces that particles leave in each layer of the detector allow for effective particle identification and accurate measurements of energy and momentum. (The role of each layer in the detector is discussed below.) As the energy of the particles produced by the accelerator increases, the detectors attached to it must grow to effectively measure and stop higher-energy particles. ATLAS is the largest detector ever built at a particle collider.|$|E
