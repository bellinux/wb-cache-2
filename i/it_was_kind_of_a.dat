[...] The name itself, inspired {{by the name of}} a Jim Dine painting depicting a comb and a few strands of hair, was a reaction to the restrictions of civilization and consumerism and a preference for naturalism. [...] Rado remembers that long hair [...] "was a visible form of awareness in the consciousness expansion. The longer the hair got, the more expansive the mind was. Long hair was shocking, and it was a revolutionary act to grow long hair. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flag, really." ...|$|E

[...] "Their biggest fear, and why <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stepchild project, [...] {{they were afraid of}} their core {{audience}} hating the film and not coming." [...] To convey Burton's' involvement and attract a wider audience, Disney marketed the film as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. Burton explained that,"...it turned more into more of a brand-name thing, it turned into something else, which I'm not quite sure about." [...] The film premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, and was given a limited release on October 15, 1993, before its wide theatrical release on October 29.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia. The opening sequence was filmed outside at night, though the subsequent sceneLucy's interrogation and executionoccurred in a motel set constructed on a sound stage. Atypical to the series, the motel room {{did not have a}} noticeable theme. Production designer John Marcynuk commented, [...] "That motel room was essentially a killing floor for the boys...and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cold interrogation scene, so we tried to keep it not so friendly. When you walked through it, it definitely felt like a place [...] a murder had been committed. It wouldn't have been the first time a murder had been committed in that room, either. It was the type of place where bad things happen." [...] Marcynuk took a different approach for Gordon's death scene, utilizing green tones and a cool color palette to create a greater visual contrast with the blood.|$|E

500|$|Nevermind was {{mastered}} on {{the afternoon}} of August 2 at The Mastering Lab in Hollywood, California. Howie Weinberg started working alone when no one else showed up at the appointed time in the studio; by the time Nirvana, Andy Wallace, and Gary Gersh arrived, Weinberg had mastered most of the album. One of the songs mastered at the session, a hidden track called [...] "Endless, Nameless" [...] intended to appear at the end of [...] "Something in the Way", was accidentally left off initial pressings of the album. Weinberg recalled, [...] "In the beginning, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> verbal thing to put that track at the end. Maybe I misconstrued their instructions, so you can call it my mistake if you want. Maybe I didn't write it down when Nirvana or the record company said to do it. So, when they pressed the first twenty thousand or so CDs, albums, and cassettes, it wasn't on there." [...] When the band discovered the song's omission after listening to its copy of the album, Cobain called Weinberg and demanded he rectify the mistake. Weinberg complied and added about ten minutes of silence between the end of [...] "Something in the Way" [...] and the start of the hidden track on future pressings of the album.|$|E
500|$|Futterman was {{impressed}} that in [...] "Without You", Glee crafted a [...] "cover to rival the original", {{and said it}} [...] "totally works".

Both Lynch and Chaney gave it a [...] "B", and the latter wrote [...] "I can't deny that she sang {{the heck out of}} it". Chaney was not so pleased with [...] "We Found Love", to which she gave a [...] "C". She wrote that it was [...] "part old Esther Williams movie, part classic 'SNL' sketch with Harry Shearer and Martin Short and part music video for 'Magic' by the Cars. In short, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> train wreck." [...] However, she and Stanhope, who said it was [...] "way too fast-paced", were in the minority. Lynch called it [...] "sheer pleasure" [...] and gave it an [...] "A−", and Slezak was even more enthusiastic with an [...] "A+" [...] grade and described it as a [...] "sublimely, ridiculously, excessively terrific production number" [...] which he placed [...] "in the show's all-time Top 10". VanDerWerff praised the [...] "nice sense of visual spectacle", and Hankinson called it [...] "really fantastic" [...] and [...] "something different". Futterman, after she admitted to her [...] "unabashed love" [...] of the song, noted that the show had [...] "found the trifecta of a current song that both fits the overall theme of the show and the characters singing it".|$|E
500|$|Madonna's company Maverick Records sent {{a promotional}} megamix titled [...] "GHV2 Megamix" [...] to radio {{stations}} {{in order to promote}} the compilation, on October 29, 2001.

Remixes were produced by Thunderpuss, Johnny Rocks & Mac Quayle and Tracy Young. Chris Cox from Thunderpuss explained, [...] "Basically, they were dong the greatest-hits album... and so they approached actually a couple of different remix entities to take a stab at doing a megamix, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cattle call, actually. They basically liked ours the best and so they put it out." [...] The remix peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in 2001. The [...] "GHV2 Megamix"s accompanying music video, directed by Dago Gonzalez of Veneno Inc., was compiled of images of Madonna's live performances and previous music videos and premiered on November 2, 2001, through Total Request Live (TRL) and MTV's website. Chuck Taylor from Billboard complimented the remix, saying that [...] "its quite a trip down 80s memory lane from an artist whose continually evolving body of work stands strong—even when summarized in this novel context." ...|$|E

500|$|Final Destination was {{conceived}} by writers Jeffrey Reddick, James Wong, and Glen Morgan from Flight 180, a spec script {{intended for use}} in The X-Files. The film premiered across the United States and Canada on March 17, 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally. The film's success inspired New Line Cinema then-President of Production Toby Emmerich to approach Reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively. Reddick asserted that he [...] "wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again.” Unfortunately, Wong and Morgan weren't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects The One and Willard. Instead, New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator David R. Ellis as director and writing partners Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber as co-writers. [...] "Second unit is like an extension of directing, you’re doing big action sequences on film {{and it was just}} something I was going after. Once I got the offer from New Line and we got a good script, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> natural transition," [...] Ellis professed. [...] "I wanted our film to be able to stand alone but I watched Final Destination to see what they did that was so successful. I tried to use some of that while trying to keep a stand-alone feel for our movie. I kind of took what worked and tried to improve on it," [...] Ellis added. [...] "We wanted to take what the first film did effectively, and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters. When we first started writing this, we were trying to think, 'How can we make Death just a total badass?' and to be perfectly honest, the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in!" [...] Bress uncovered. On the other hand, producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions also returned and helped on financing the film.|$|E

[...] Bush said he was [...] "disappointed and felt like they fumbled the—particularly the Saddam Hussein—execution.

2500|$|Emerson, Lake & Palmer {{conflicted}} between Emerson's {{interest in}} complex, classically-influenced music and Lake's more straightforward rock tastes. Lake complained that Emerson chose {{to play in}} keys that were not {{a good fit for}} his voice. During the making of the band's second album Tarkus, Lake initially rejected the title track, but was persuaded to record it following a band meeting with management, which ended in the addition of an original Lake tune, [...] "Battlefield", into the suite. Lake's track [...] "From the Beginning", released on Trilogy in 1972, had no particular source of inspiration; [...] "I just felt an inspiration to do it, and it flowed through me in a natural way. My hands fell upon these very unusual chords... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gift". It was released as a single, and reached number 39 in the US.|$|E
2500|$|On October 19, 2012, in an interview, West Coast rapper Kendrick Lamar {{revealed}} that he recorded a song with T.I. for the album. The song reportedly also features B.o.B and samples Gotye's hit single [...] "Somebody That I Used to Know". The song's mass appeal attracted T.I. to the sample: [...] "The record's just jamming. When I heard the twist they put on it, man, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> no-brainer." [...] T.I. also chose the record for its crossover ability, which {{he has always been}} successful with in the past: [...] "It sounds like hip-hop with an international twist to it, and I'm known for taking those types of records and bridging that gap between what we do and what they do," [...] he explained, dropping in a couple of examples. [...] "From M.I.A.'s 'Paper Planes' to 'Swagga Like Us,' we took [...] 'Gypsy Woman' for 'Why You Wanna.'" [...] Over the drum-heavy sample, Lamar and Bobby Ray join T.I. in sharing some nostalgic stories, which he says reminds him of some of a few renowned MCs and their classic projects: [...] " [...] taking turns on our story about a female that we knew years, years, years ago before we were who we are today. It kinda puts me {{in the mind of the}} 'Da Art Of Storytellin' [...] from Outkast and Slick Rick. It puts me in the mind of that." [...] The song, which failed to make the album's final track listing probably due to sample clearances, is titled [...] "Memories Back Then".

That was kind of the other thing, {{that was the first time}} we ever played with bands we don’t like. Up until then it was like you go on tour with bands you feel a kinship with and we had never been exposed to some like mass thing where you’re playing with a band like Puddle of Mudd or whoever it was at the time who made me feel like [...] "Oh I got to make some kind of a statement."
