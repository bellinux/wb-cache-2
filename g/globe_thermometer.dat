40|$|The ICube Laboratory (UMR 7357 University of Strasbourg - CNRS), in {{collaboration}} with the PIAF Laboratory (UMR 547 INRA) and the local association for atmospheric pollution monitoring (ASPA), has initiated in 2013 a fieldwork experiment to measure and monitor the urban climate of the city of Strasbourg, East of France, with a particular focus on the role of vegetation with respect to micro-climatic conditions suitable for human comfort. This fieldwork experiment is organized around four complementary objectives. At first, a detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal variability of the urban heat island effect is conducted through the deployment of a network of twenty-three weather stations in and around the city, monitoring standard parameters such as air temperature and humidity, as well as wind speed and direction. This network also contributes to the European INTERREG IV project “Atmo-IDEE”. Secondly, to allow for an in-depth analysis of the physical processes controlling the UHI, two sites have been equipped with a set of radiometers and eddy correlation sensors to measure the radiative and energy balance. The first site, located in a densely urbanized area, can be considered as mineral and has a large footprint since the sensors are installed 30 meters above ground. The second site is located in an urban park near the city center, and is equipped with the same set of instruments, here on top of a 20 meters high mast. The later site is used to fulfill the third objective, which is to closely keep track of the contribution of the vegetation to turbulent fluxes measured on top of the urban canopy. To do so, a group of six trees is equipped with sap flow sensors. Simultaneously, other sensors are monitoring the soil temperature and water content at seven levels, as well as the photosynthetically active radiation profile below, inside and on top of a tree. Additionally, the contribution of the soil and grass is measured during intensive observation periods using a closed transpiration chamber. The last objective of this experiment is to measure thermal comfort indices, combining integral radiation measurement methods, black <b>globe</b> <b>thermometers,</b> 38 mm flat <b>globe</b> <b>thermometers</b> and a dense set of twenty weather stations (UBIQUITY auto-communicating network). The entire experimental design is presented together with preliminary results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{analyzed}} how {{the variations}} of plant area index (PAI) and weather conditions alter {{the influence of}} urban green infrastructure (UGI) on micro-climate. To observe how diverse UGIs affect the ambi-ent microclimate through the seasons, microclimatic data were measured {{during the growing season}} at five sites in a local urban area in The Netherlands. Site Awas located in an open space; sites B, C, and D were covered by different types and configurations of green infrastruc-ture (grove, a single deciduous tree, and street trees, respectively); and site E was adjacent to buildings to study the effects of their façades on microclimate. Hemispherical photography and <b>globe</b> <b>thermometers</b> were used to quantify PAI and thermal comfort at both shaded and unshaded locations. The results showed that groves with high tree density (site B) have the strongest effect onmicroclimate conditions. Monthly variations in the differences of mean radiant temperature (ΔTmrt) between shaded and unshaded areas followed the same pattern as the PAI. Linear regression showed a signifi-cant positive correlation between PAI and ΔTmrt. The difference of daily average air temperature (ΔTa) between shaded and unshaded areas was also positively correlated to PAI, but with a slope coefficient below the measurement accuracy (± 0. 5 °C). This study showed that weather conditions can significantly impact the effectiveness of UGI in regulating microclimate. The results of this study can support the development of appropriate UGI measures to enhance thermal comfort in urban areas...|$|R

40|$|Assessing outdoor human {{thermal comfort}} and urban climate quality require {{experimental}} investigation of microclimatic conditions and their variations in open urban spaces. For this, {{it is essential}} to provide quantitative information on air temperature, humidity, wind velocity and mean radiant temperature. These parameters can be quantified directly except mean radiant temperature (Tmrt). The most accurate method to quantify Tmrt is integral radiation measurements (3 -D shortwave and long-wave) which require using expensive radiometer instruments. To overcome this limitation the well-known <b>globe</b> <b>thermometer</b> method was suggested to calculate Tmrt. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the possibility of using indoor <b>globe</b> <b>thermometer</b> method in predicting outdoor mean radiant temperature under Malaysia tropical microclimate. <b>Globe</b> <b>thermometer</b> method using small and large sizes of black-painted copper globes (50 mm, 150 mm) were used to estimate Tmrt and compare it with the reference Tmrt estimated by integral radiation method. The results revealed that the <b>globe</b> <b>thermometer</b> method considerably overestimated Tmrt during the middle of the day and slightly underestimated it in the morning and late evening. The difference between the two methods was obvious when the amount of incoming solar radiation was high. The results also showed that the effect of globe size on the estimated Tmrt is mostly small. Though, the estimated Tmrt by the small globe showed a relatively large amount of scattering caused by rapid changes in radiation and wind speed...|$|E

Entretanto, existe carência de informações comparando a temperatura da água entre os bebedouros mais comumente empregados em aviários de postura no Brasil. Neste trabalho, avaliou-se a variação da temperatura da água para dois tipos de bebedouro: "nipple" e calha. O experimento foi conduzido em uma instalação {{comercial}} de postura, localizada na região Oeste do Paraná. Para a determinação da temperatura da água, das 8 às 18 h, foram instalados termômetros de mercúrio com o bulbo inserido no interior da água em bebedouros tipo "nipple" e calha, em dois galpões idênticos. Foi estimado o ITGU do ambiente a partir de dados obtidos de termômetros de globo negro instalados em local próximo ao da coleta de temperatura da água, na região central dos galpões. Os maiores valores de temperatura da água foram observados no sistema "nipple", que atingiu 31 ºC às 16 h, em média, enquanto no sistema calha atingiu 26, 4 ºC. Observou-se a existência de relação entre a temperatura da água e os valores de ITGU, sendo o maior coeficiente de correlação encontrado para o sistema "nipple", de R² = 0, 9040, enquanto para o sistema de calha foi de R² = 0, 8424. Desconsiderando o aspecto sanitário, para as condições em que o trabalho foi desenvolvido, pode-se concluir que o melhor sistema, em termos de temperatura da água de bebida, foi o tipo calha.

In this research, drinking water temperature variation was evaluated considering two waterier systems: nipple and continuous. The trial was conduced in a laying hens commercial housing, located in the West region of Paraná State, Brazil. For the water temperature recording, thermometers were placed inside the water in the nipple and the continuous drinker systems, in two similar buildings, from 8 : 00 AM to 6 : 00 PM. The BGHI (black globe humidity index) was estimated using the obtained data from black <b>globe</b> <b>thermometers</b> placed near the place where water temperature was recorded, in the central area of the building. The highest water temperature values were observed in the nipple system, that reached 31 ºC at 4 : 00 PM (average values), while in the continuous system it reached 26. 4 ºC. A relation between water temperature and environmental BGHI values was calculated. The highest correlation coefficient was found for the nipple system. Without considering the sanitary aspect for the conditions in which the work was developed, it can be concluded that the best system is the continuous waterier, in terms of drinking water temperature...|$|R

An alternative to an appropriate destination of EVA waste is its use in {{the manufacture of}} blocks produced with lightweight concrete. The issue addressed in this study is related to the thermal gains made by vertical sealing and thermal comfort of built environments. The environments that do not have the appropriate type of masonry to its climate generate thermal comfort problems due to loss, or excessive heat gain, what happens in regions with predominantly hot dry weather wet hot, as is the case of Northeast Brazil. Considering the thermal discomfort of environments due to misuse elements appropriate in the walls of buildings, as well as the problem of disposal of waste EVA, this work is to extend the characterization of the thermal performance of the blocks composed of EVA. Therefore, we sought to analyze compared samples developed from EVA blocks with other components.

40|$|The mean radiant {{temperature}} (m. r. t.) {{is usually}} assessed as the radiation received at a point (or by a small sphere), but it is clearly important to know how adequately this parameter describes the heat load on a man, for {{in the presence of}} hot surfaces his shape and orientation may have significant effects. This paper presents the results of experiments designed to assess the radiant heat received by a man in a controlled temperature room in which non-uniform environments were achieved by locating a heated panel either overhead or on one wall.

40|$|Rapid {{urbanisation}} {{results in}} {{more complex and}} diverse alterations in city morphology. The urban microclimate is strongly influenced by terrestrial structures, which result in significant spatial non-uniformity and temporal fluctuations of the outdoor thermal environment. The study of outdoor thermal comfort has become an appealing academic topic alongside conventional research on the urban environment. A fundamental approach {{in the investigation of}} local outdoor phenomena is the fixed-point field measurement conducted according to the ‘Euler’ concept. Unfortunately existing meteorological sensors are either extremely cumbersome or single-function. There is a lack of convenient and economical measurement techniques, which greatly restricts high-density and massive field experiments. This study is motivated by a desire to facilitate the on-site observation of outdoor micrometeorological parameters that play the most important role in human thermal sensation. The <b>globe</b> <b>thermometer</b> {{has the potential to be}} developed into an integral instrument, as it measures the mean radiant temperature by responding to the combined influence of multiple environmental parameters. There have been a few impressive early attempts at its function extension. But being a simple apparatus originally invented for use indoors, its application in outdoor settings has sparked wide controversy in terms of accuracy. This thesis conducts a systematic investigation of how to obtain the correct globe temperature according to a comprehensive understanding of its principle and how to interpret implicit information using the wavelet method to extend the function of a <b>globe</b> <b>thermometer.</b> The thermal response of a <b>globe</b> <b>thermometer</b> is determined by environment parameters and influenced by its configuration. To ascertain the impact of intrinsic factors, time-domain observations were conducted in both static indoor conditions and the dynamic outdoor environment. The frequency-domain coupling between globe temperature and environmental parameters were tested by continuous wavelet transforms. The wind and radiation patterns which influence the globe’s thermal response were identified by discrete wavelet decomposition and correlation analysis. The effects of surface colour (emissivity), globe size, and material were generalised. The experimental results challenge the suitability of the commonly used acrylic <b>globe</b> <b>thermometer.</b> This study puts forward an emendation of the conventional calculation equation by redefining it in the frequency space directly related to radiant factors. The globe temperature couples with radiation and wind speed in distinctly different spaces of the frequency-domain, which suggests the causality between them exists in separate frequencies. The implicit information hidden in the fluctuant globe temperature is thus extracted, and it is used for empirical estimation of local radiant fluxes and the mean wind speed. By clarifying the essential configurations, this study corrects some common mistakes in the outdoor application of globe thermometers. For the first time, time-series of globe temperatures were analysed by wavelet transforms, based on which the accuracy of estimated mean radiant temperature is improved. An empirical method for estimating the local shortwave and longwave fluxes and wind speed by normal-sized, non-heated globe thermometers is proposed. It provides a heuristic method for future development of globe thermometers for multi-parameter outdoor observations. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

However, heatstroke onset depends largely on the physiological condition of the individual. Wearable thermal sensors can measure body temperature and heat rate, but failure to check sensor readings or ignoring alarms can lead to failure of such measures to prevent heatstroke.

Today's architectural solution of university schoolrooms is not {{in accord with the}} possibilities of natural ventilation. In today's university schoolrooms, we can use just the natural ventilation therefore schoolrooms must be correctly ventilated by windows and doors. Correct and sufficient natural ventilation of university schoolrooms is very important because students spend majority of their time in the university in those schoolrooms. In Slovak universities, the natural ventilation is incorrectly and insufficiently provided. The biggest problem is the winter season, when the natural ventilation is provided just by opening doors into the corridor. By this way, sufficient supply of oxygen is not provided, what causes distractibility and feeling of tiredness by students. Therefore, the research was focused on the comparison and analysis of different ways of natural ventilation in university schoolrooms. Experimental measurements in university schoolroom were carried out, where the parameters of thermal comfort were measured at different systems of natural ventilation with the device Almemo 2590. Measurements were carrying out in two height levels, which were enabled by the change of the position of tripod, on which were mounted: temperature and humidity sensor, <b>globe</b> <b>thermometer,</b> turbulence sensor.

40|$|Background The {{exposure}} {{of individuals to}} heat at different jobs warrants the use of heat stress evaluation indices. Objectives The {{aim of this study}} was to validate environmental stress index using an infrared radiation (IR) measurement instrument as a substitute for pyranometer in indoor workplaces. Methods This study was conducted on 2303 indoor workstations in different industries in Isfahan, Iran, during July, August, and September in 2012. The intensity of the Infrared Radiation (IR) (w/m 2) was measured at five-centimeter distances in six different directions, above, opposite, right, left, behind and below the <b>globe</b> <b>thermometer.</b> Then, the dry globe temperature (Ta), wet globe temperature (Tnw), globe temperature (Tg) and relative humidity (RH) were also simultaneously measured. The data were analyzed using correlation and regression by the SPSS 18 software. Results The study results indicate that a high correlation (r = 0. 96) exists between the environmental stress index (ESI) and the values of wet bulb globe temperature (P < 0. 01). According to the following equation, WBGT = 1. 086 × ESI - 1. 846, the environmental stress index is able to explain 91 % (R 2 = 0. 91) of the WBGT index variations (P < 0. 01). Conclusions Based on the results, to study heat stress in indoor workplaces when the WBGT measurement instrument is not available and also in short-term exposures (shorter than 30 minutes) when measuring the wet bulb globe temperature shows a considerable error, it is possible to calculate the environmental stress index and accordingly to the WBGT index, by measuring the parameters of dry bulb temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH), and infrared radiation intensity that can be easily measured in a short time...|$|E

The results from a monitoring of room temperatures in 21 office rooms during summer 2002 show that room temperatures exceeds 25 °C in less than 8 % of the working hours, even at high ambient air temperatures. In two offices, experiments were carried out {{in order to determine}} the efficiency of night ventilation dependent on air change rate, solar and internal heat gains. During the experiments, meteorological data, air change rates, air temperatures (incl. three-dimensional temperature field), surface temperatures (floor, ceiling, window, and internal wall) and the operative room temperature (<b>globe</b> <b>thermometer)</b> were measured. The aim is to identify two characteristic building parameters, i. e. the thermal loss factor H and the solar aperture G. Though the night ventilation effect is described only by the thermal loss factor H, the solar aperture G is necessary to determine the complete energy balance for the room. Thus, the night ventilation effect can be separated from other terms in the energy balance. The experiments (one room with and one without night ventilation) are evaluated by using both a parametric model and the ESP-r building simulation programme. While the results from the building simulation match the measurements but deals with many input parameters, the parametric model deals only with two building characteristics and few weather data but does not agree well with measurements at each time step. Therefore, both models are merged in order to develop a method for data evaluation in office buildings with night ventilation and to provide a simple model for integration in a building management system...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of climatic conditions on performance in a 50 km mountainous trail running race. Anecdotal evidence suggests that increased humidity in forested race courses is associated with increased heat stress and decreased performance in ultra-marathoners. We hypothesized that slower climb times would be associated with elevated ambient vapour pressure (VP) and temperature during an ultra-marathon course with heavy tree cover. The rationale follows from body heat loss and cooling being largely dependent on evaporation of eccrine sweat, which is directly proportional to the VP gradient between the ambient air and that on the skin surface. METHODS: Eight healthy males and one female volunteered for the study. Their mean height was 178. 3 ± 5. 5 cm (mean±SD), weight 71. 0 ± 8. 3 kg, Body Mass Index 22. 4 ± 2. 1 ml/kg 2, and age 49. 7 ± 8. 2 years. The office of research ethics at SFU approved the study. Dry bulb (DBT) and wet bulb temperatures were assessed as well as relative humidity (RH) with an electronic humidity sensor. From these ambient VP was determined from a psychometric chart. Wind velocity was assessed with an anemometer. Globe temperature was determined using a Vernon <b>globe</b> <b>thermometer.</b> Remote Omega sensors were used to measure temperature, RH and dew points at three course locations. The GPS coordinates of measurement sites were determined using a handheld instrument. First order linear regression analysis was employed for the analyses and the P value was set at 0. 05. RESULTS: Over the race duration there were progressive increases in DB temperature, RH and ambient VP. The mean DBT at the 3 maximum elevations in the race was 21. 52 ± 0. 57 °C and this was positively correlated to mean climb time of 72. 26 ± 9. 76 min with an R 2 = 0. 92, p 3 ̆c 0. 05.

40|$|Thermal {{environment}} (TE) in {{livestock production}} systems effects the animal’s thermal comfort, feed efficiency, and the producer’s operating costs. Accurate {{assessment of the}} radiative component of TE requires Mean Radiant Temperature (tmr) measurement with a Black <b>Globe</b> <b>Thermometer</b> (BGT); however, these devices are cost prohibitive (if multiple are needed), have limited commercial availability, and lack confidence {{for a range of}} conditions commonly found in a swine facility. The objectives were to design, construct and commission a novel and well-documented TE simulation system named Animal Thermal Environment Replication and Measurement System (AThERMS). Simulations of different combinations of dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity, and airspeeds while independently controlling chamber surface temperature (ts) can be evaluated. AThERMS is a 1. 04 x 1. 17 x 1. 04 m chamber inside a large Insulated Enclosure (IE) where air supplied by an air handling unit provides unique TEs to both AThERMS and the IE. Commissioning of AThERMS prior to BGT assessment included a qualitative (smoke visualization) and quantitative (three-dimensional traverse and CFD model) velocity characterization in the central region of the chamber and verification of similar and stable ts for all six surfaces. Analysis of velocity contours sliced in different x, y, z planes surrounding the BGT at three nominal flowrates indicated steady patterns and helped guide placement of the airspeed sensor used to derive the impact of convection on measured BGT temperature. Results also showed at three nominal ts (13 °C, 23 °C, and 33 °C), during a 2 h steady state operation, that maximum mean difference between any two ts measured by six digital IR sensors was 0. 26 °C with standard deviations less than 0. 11 °C. Determination of the time constant (t) for cooling and heating the surfaces showed the time to reach steady-state (3 t, ~ 95 %) to be 85. 4 and 42 min, respectively. AThERMS can be used to simulate different TEs a housed animal may experience and function as a reference to calibrate or verify TE measurements...|$|E

40|$|CAPÍTULO 2 : Avaliou-se o efeito da sombra, em confinamento {{comercial}} de bovinos, sobre o ganho de peso médio (GPM) e o rendimento de carcaça. Foram utilizados 156 animais nelores e anelorados, com peso inicial médio de 396 kg, divididos em dois currais, um sombreado com 90 animais e outro não sombreado com 66. O abate ocorreu em dois momentos, aos 77 dias e aos 118 dias de confinamento. A alimentação compunha-se de uma ração com uréia, farelo de soja e núcleo de uma empresa comercial, que era sobreposta à silagem de sorgo e acrescida de caroço de algodão e sorgo em grão triturado e fornecida &# 8213;ad-libitum&# 8214;. Determinaram-se as temperaturas extremas (máxima e mínima); temperatura do bulbo seco e bulbo úmido; temperatura do globotermômetro à sombra e ao sol; velocidade do vento e índice pluviométrico. Estes dados foram utilizados na determinação de quatro índices de ambiente térmico (Índice de Temperatura e Umidade - ITU; Índice de Temperatura e Globo Úmido - ITGU; Índice de Temperatura Equivalente - ITE e Índice de Carga Térmica - ICT) para verificação da possibilidade de estresse térmico. O desempenho animal foi obtido pela pesagem no início do confinamento e no momento da venda dos animais. Também foi considerado o rendimento de carcaça aos 118 dias. Aplicou-se análise de variância e Teste de Tukey a 5 %, sendo a variável ganho de peso corrigida pela covariância por meio do peso inicial. Concluiu-se que o acesso à sombra de animais da raça nelore e anelorados, confinados comercialmente, favorece maior ganho de peso aos 77 dias e maior rendimento de carcaça aos 118 dias de confinamento. CHAPTER 2 : It evaluated {{itself the}} effect of the shade, in commercial feedlot beef cattle, about the average weight gain (AWG) and performance of carcass. They were utilized 156 animals Nelores (Bos Indicus) and Nelore-cross, with average initial weight 396 kg, divided in two pens, a shading with 90 animals (handling) and another not shady with 66 (witness); counts on occurred in two moments to the 77 days and to the 118 days of confinement. The food composed itself of a feed with urea, crumb of soy and supplement premix of a commercial brand, that was placed on top to the sorghum tillage and added of lump of cotton and sorghum in grain shredded and supplied "ad-libitum". It determined itself the extreme temperatures (maximum and most minimum); temperature of the dry bulb and wet bulb; temperature of the Black <b>Globe</b> <b>Thermometer</b> in the shade and to the sun; speed of the wind and precipitation. These facts were utilized in the determination of four indices of thermal environment (Temperature-Humidity Index - THI; Wet Bulb Globe Temperature - WBGT; Equivalent Temperature Index - ETI and Heat Load Index - HLI) for verification of the possibility of thermal stress. The animal performance was obtained by the weighing {{in the beginning of the}} confinement and when the animals were sold; also was considered the performance of carcass to the 118 days, in the second counts on. It applied analysis of variance and Tukey´s Test at 5 %, being the variable I earn of weight corrected by the co-variance by means of the initial weight.

Foi conduzido um experimento nas instalações ao ar livre no setor de suinocultura da UAST/ UFRPE localizadas em Serra Talhada, região do Sertão do Pajeú no estado de Pernambuco. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi o inteiramente casualizado, com dois tratamentos e oito repetições para a avaliação dos parâmetros sanguíneos e dez repetições para avaliação do comportamento. Os tratamentos consistiram de dois grupamentos genéticos, sendo o primeiro grupo composto por cruzamento de raças melhorada Duroc, Pietran,Large White e Landrace e o segundo grupamento por animais nativos de raça Piau e Sem Raça Definida (SRD). Todos os animais eram fêmeas prenhes em segunda ordem de gestação, com peso médio de 198, 66 kg. Os parâmetros sanguíneos avaliados foram: glicose, ureia, creatinina e cortisol. Apenas a ureia não apresentou efeito significativo, os demais resultados apresentaram diferenças adaptativas dos diferentes grupos genéticos. O comportamento foi realizado durante três dias consecutivos com observações a cada dez minutos durante as 24 horas do dia. Os dias foram divididos em quatro períodos: manhã, tarde, noite e madrugada. Na descrição da influência do ambiente sobre a fisiologia dos animais, foram mensuradas a temperatura retal através de termômetro digital e frequência respiratória obtida por meio de contagem dos movimentos do flanco dos animais em descanso durante um minuto. Para avaliar as variáveis climáticas durante o período experimental foram instalados em um abrigo meteorológico o psicrômetro e o termômetro de globo negro (Gn). As leituras foram realizadas em intervalos de duas horas a partir do inicio do experimento. Diariamente, foram registrados os valores das temperaturas máximas e mínimas. O comportamento dos animais não apresentou fora do padrão, para as variáveis observadas, apesar das variáveis climáticas acusarem temperaturas acima das condições de conforto para que os animais desenvolvam as melhores condições de vida. As raças apresentaram boa condição de adaptabilidade quando comparada às raças nativas. Aiming {{to evaluate}} animal behavior and blood parameters, such as pigs animal welfare indicators reared outdoors, {{during the month}} of February 2014, was conducted an experiment in outdoor installations in the swine sector of UAST/UFRPE, located in Serra Talhada, Pajeú region of Sertão of Pernambuco. The experimental design was a completely randomized design with two treatments and eight repetitions for the evaluation of blood parameters and ten repetitions to evaluate performance. The treatments consisted of two experimental groups, the first group composed of intersection of improved breeds Duroc,Pietran,Large White and Landrace and the second group by native animals Piau breed and undefined breed (SRD). All animals were pregnant females in second order of pregnancy, with an average weight of 198. 66 kg. The evaluated parameters were blood glucose, urea, creatinine and cortisol. Just urea had no significant effect, the other results represented the adaptive differences of different genetic groups. The behavior was conducted during three consecutive days with observations every ten minutes in a 24 hours period. The days were divide into four periods:, morning, noon, night and morning. In the description of environmental influence on the physiology of the animals were measured via rectal temperature digital thermometer, and respiratory frequency obtained by counting the movements of the animals in the resting edge for one minute.

40|$|Resumo: No estudo do comportamento animal, semi-intensiva e in tensiva, existe um número muito grande de variáveis e parâmetros a serem considerados para se obter condições ambientais ideais a um custo razoável. Este trabalho de pesquisa procurou fornecer alguns dados iniciais para o estudo do microclima gerado dentro de uma estrutura a partir de dados ambientais. Construíram-se oito protótipos, sendo alguns com diferentes forma geométricas e outros com a mesma forma geométrica, porém todos apresentando a capacidade de volume interno de ar no valor de 1 metro cúbico. Em quatro protótipos foram estudados o efeito do tipo de forma geométrica na quantidade de calor radiante interno â estrutura, através do registro de temperaturas de mãxima e mini ma. Estes quatro protótipos foram colocados em área experimental, no sentido Norte-Sul para receber a maior quantidade de ra diação durante os meses em que foram realizados os experimentos, pois todos estes protótipos funcionavam como corpos negros. Após o registro das temperaturas, construíram-se Tabelas e Gráficos que demonstraram que a melhor forma geométrica para prover um conforto térmico, é a paralelepípeda com telhado em duas águas. Estudou-se, com três outros protótipos abertos com telhado em uma agua, o efeito do tipo de {{material}} de cobertura na quantidade de calor radiante interno â estrutura, através da leitura de temperaturas de máxima e mínima; e temperatura de Globo Preto. Os três materiais usados foram: telha cerâmica tipo capa e canal (paulista), telha de cimento amiante ondulado e telha de alumínio ondulado. Observou-se que a telha de cerâmica provia a estrutura de melhor conforto ambiental em relação as demais testadas. O terceiro estudo foi com o objetivo de se determinar, através de dois protótipos iguais em direções opostas: Leste-Oeste e Norte-Sul, o efeito do posicionamento da estrutura com relação ao Sol na quantidade de calor radiante interno. Abstract: There {{are many}} variables and parameters which {{have to be}} considered {{in order to determine the}} most economical factors of environmental conditions for the study of animal behaviors in confined and semi-confined areas. The purpose of this research is to determine the factors by analyzing the microclimate data generated in an animal housing subjected to environmental influences. Eight prototype simple structures with the same inner volume of 1 m were studied. The structures many have different shapes. The shape effects were determined in four prototype structures by means of calculating the amount of radiation heat transfered into the structure. A set of thermometers which can record the maximum and minimum temperatures were used. These four prototype structures were oriented in the direction of north-south orientation in order to receive the maximum amount of solar radiation. All the prototype structures were considered as black bodies. The results of temperature data shown in the Tables and Graphs indicated that the paralelepipoid shape with gable roof could generate the highest temperatures in the structure. There are three other prototype structures of one-side inclination roof and metal wire walls. Different materials were used for the roof of these structures. The roof materials were asbestos, cement, ceramic and aluminum. The amount of radiation heat received inside these structures were determined by the maxima-minima" thermometers and black <b>Globe</b> <b>thermometer.</b> The structure with the ceramic roof showed the most comfortable inner temperature as compared with other two structures. The influence of the orientation of the - prototype structures in the directions of north-south and east-west on the amount of radiation heat transfered inside the structure was also studied. It was found that the structure oriented in the east-west received more radiation heat. The reason is that the inner temperatures of these prototype structures are also functions of other parameters. Part of the reason is that the structures oriented in the E-W direction have larger wall areas than, those oriented in the N-S direction. However, it can not be, concluded that the structure for animal productions should be oriented in the E-W direction. On the other hand the structures of E-W orientation may receive a larger amount of solar radiation due to the fact that both north and south side of walls are exposed to the sun. The procedure results and discussions, conclusions and suggestions for future research are presented as follows...|$|E
