25|$|Alan Davidson led {{their attack}} {{in this and}} other Tests. He had a {{beautiful}} action, run-up and delivery and, besides being pretty fast, he made the ball swing into the batsmen very late.

500|$|Many reviews {{focused on}} the show's fusion of Wild West and outer space motifs.

Roush opined that the shift from space travel to horseback was [...] "jarring", but that once he <b>got</b> <b>used</b> to this, he found the characters cleverly conceived, and the writing a crisp balance of action, tension and humor. Several reviewers, however, criticized the show's setting; Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that the melding of the western and science fiction genres was a [...] "forced hodgepodge of two alarmingly opposite genres {{just for the sake}} of being different" [...] and called the series a [...] "vast disappointment", and Carina Chocano of Salon.com said that while the [...] "space as Wild West" [...] metaphor is fairly redundant, neither genre connected to the present. Emily Nussbaum of the New York Times, reviewing the DVD set, noted that the program featured [...] "an oddball genre mix that might have doomed it from the beginning: it was a character-rich sci-fi western comedy-drama with existential underpinnings, a hard sell during a season dominated by Joe Millionaire".|$|E

In 1989, Goater signed for Rotherham United in order to play first team football.

At first I thought the sun never shone and it wasn't for me." [...] However, he gradually <b>got</b> <b>used</b> to living in England, and over the course of seven seasons at Rotherham he gained a reputation as a reliable lower division striker, scoring 86 goals in 262 appearances, with a winner's medal for the 1996 Auto Windscreens Shield the highlight. A 1992 League Cup tie against Everton gave Goater his first experience of playing against a Premier League team. In the first leg, Goater scored the only goal of the game as Rotherham won 1–0. However, Everton won the return leg 3–0 and Rotherham were eliminated. In 1993, Goater also had a brief loan spell at Notts County, though he made only one appearance for the Nottingham club due to a work permit problem. Towards the end of the 1995–96 season, Goater had a disagreement with Rotherham manager Archie Gemmill, and decided his future lay elsewhere.|$|E
