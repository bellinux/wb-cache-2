500|$|In 1966, Norman {{recorded}} several tracks with Jimi Hendrix on {{session at}} Abtone Studio in New York: [...] "You're Only Hurting Yourself", [...] "Little Groovemaker" [...] and [...] "On You Girlie <b>It</b> <b>Looks</b> <b>so</b> Good". The second {{of these songs}} was retooled under the title [...] "Groove Maker" [...] and has been included {{on a number of}} Hendrix releases. According to Black Gold: The Lost Archives of Jimi Hendrix, Norman—not Lonnie Youngblood as popularly supposed—was the primary performer besides Hendrix on this song. Jimi Hendrix– From the Benjamin Franklin Studios 3rd Edition Part 1: The Complete Guide to the Recorded Work of Jimi Hendrix posits Youngblood on saxophone, but gives writing credit to Norman. Jimi Hendrix: Musician documents the confusion surrounding this and other Hendrix sessions of the time, including the difficulty in tracking contributions when they also rose from later manipulation of the material as Hendrix became famous. [...] "You're Only Hurting Yourself" [...] and [...] "Little Groovemaker" [...] were first released under Norman's name as Samar records single 112 in 1966 and never again released in original form. [...] "On You Girlie <b>It</b> <b>Looks</b> <b>so</b> Good" [...] remains unreleased.|$|E
2500|$|Reviewing the {{original}} DVD release in 2002, DVD Talk's J. Doyle Wallis gave the serial {{three out of}} five stars, describing it as a [...] "nice exploit" [...] with [...] "pretty neat villains", but criticising the little the Doctor had to do, despite it being his introduction. Ian Jane of the site was more positive when reviewing the serial for its 2012 re-release, giving it four stars. He praised Pertwee and John, {{as well as the}} suspense and pacing. SFX Ian Berriman was positive towards the serial when reviewing it in 2011 with Terror of the Autons, though he noted that Liz was [...] "so snarky she's annoying", the climax with the tentacles was [...] "risible in the extreme", and it was a [...] "shame <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> dull" [...] as it was shot on film.|$|E

6000|$|There is a thorn; <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> old, [...] In truth you'd {{find it hard}} to say, [...] How {{it could}} ever have been young, [...] <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> old and grey. [...] Not higher than a two years' child [...] It stands erect this aged thorn; [...] No leaves it has, no thorny points; [...] It is a mass of knotted joints, [...] A wretched thing forlorn. [...] It stands erect, and like a stone [...] With lichens it is overgrown.|$|E

60|$|The {{number of}} women in London who flirt with their own husbands is {{perfectly}} scandalous. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> bad. It is simply washing one's clean linen in public.|$|E

60|$|Gavin {{carried the}} cloak to his bed-room, {{thinking}} to lock {{it away in}} his chest, but <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> wicked lying there {{that he seemed to}} see it after the lid was shut.|$|R
60|$|The better life! Possibly, <b>it</b> {{would hardly}} <b>look</b> <b>so</b> now; <b>it</b> is enough if <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> then. The {{greatest}} obstacle to being heroic is the doubt whether one {{may not be}} going to prove one's self a fool; the truest heroism is to resist the doubt; and the profoundest wisdom to know when {{it ought to be}} resisted, and when to be obeyed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly not,' said Gillian, almost laughing; 'but {{you don't}} understand, Mysie. It was the taking {{him up and}} letting him down, and I could not explain <b>it,</b> and <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> nasty and capricious.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Then it is {{translated}} too. Never did <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>so</b> well on Philip! See, {{our mother}} is quite gracious to him; she speaks {{to him as}} though he were some noble visitor to my Lord.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That is very interesting," [...] I said. [...] "I {{wonder if}} there is {{anything}} in it? At first blush <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> logical; but is it? Or are you simply getting morbid? What is the error? What is your error?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> strange, {{there in}} public, {{on the walls}} of the Castle gallery, where in her {{lifetime}} she had seen so many pictures. And she glanced round to see if anyone had noticed her again in front of the same sketch.|$|R
