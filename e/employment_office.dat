5|$|In 1939 PahWongso {{expanded}} his school in Blandongan {{to include an}} <b>employment</b> <b>office.</b> Established with f.1,000, the office was located above the school and by November 1939 was training 22 job seekers. The Pah Wongso Crèches, meanwhile, served more than 200 ethnic Chinese and indigene students. He continued speaking out against the working conditions in the Indies, giving a lecture to a 1,000-strong audience at the Queens Theatre in Batavia in October 1939. He remained highly popular with the ethnic Chinese.|$|E
5|$|PahWongso {{continued}} operating {{his school}} and <b>employment</b> <b>office,</b> {{under the auspices}} of the PahWongso Foundation, into the 1970s. He touted that the foundation had found positions for 1,000 young women and 11,000 young men, and advertisements offering to place labourers were issued in Indonesian, English, and Dutch. The institution also provided printing services; wrote letters on demand in English, Dutch, and Indonesian; and provided wayang performances with four kinds of puppets. PahWongso died in Jakarta on 13 May 1975.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the Hollywood {{characters}} Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto {{were popular}} in the Indies, as were imported detective films in general; however, no films in that genre had yet been produced domestically. This led Jo to make a detective film which he thought would be successful with ethnic Chinese audiences. For this, he approached L.V. Wijnhamer, Jr., an Indo man who was popular within the ethnic Chinese community for his social work; Wijnhamer, better known as Pah Wongso, helped educate abandoned children, ran an <b>employment</b> <b>office,</b> and raised funds for Red Cross aid in war-torn China. Wijnhamer accepted the role.|$|E

40|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20 th century, state and local governments in the U. S. began to {{establish}} public <b>employment</b> <b>offices.</b> These non-profit governmental organizations match job seekers and businesses. One of the main objectives of these organizations was to protect job seekers from fraudulent activities by private employment agencies. In this paper, I propose a theory that describes malpractices of private employment agencies as a situation of asymmetric information between job seekers and private employment agencies which could cause adverse selection in the labor exchange market. The establishment of public <b>employment</b> <b>offices</b> {{can be viewed as a}} policy device to eliminate low quality private employment agencies that committed malpractices. I show that public <b>employment</b> <b>offices</b> helped lower the degree of asymmetric information. The majority of job seekers who used public <b>employment</b> <b>offices</b> were unskilled workers, immigrants or migrants who were vulnerable to exploitation by private employment agencies. I also find that the role of public <b>employment</b> <b>offices</b> was especially important for interstate migrants who were most lacking in information and networks in this new environment...|$|R

5|$|In late 1938, PahWongso used a {{legal defense}} fund, {{which had been}} raised {{for him when he}} was charged with extortion, in order to {{establish}} another school; this was followed by an employment center in 1939. In 1941, Star Film released two productions starring him and featuring his name in the title. During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, PahWongso was held in a series of concentration camps in South-East Asia. He returned to the then-independent Indies by 1948, and raised funds for the Red Cross and ran an <b>employment</b> <b>office</b> until his death.|$|E
5|$|PahWongso {{continued}} {{to raise money}} for the Red Cross by selling fried peanuts. He also {{continued to}} operate his school in Blandongan, as well as the <b>employment</b> <b>office,</b> which trained young men and women for positions such as maids, gardeners, and bellhops, then placed them with employers. Several of PahWongso's students came from islands other than Java. De Nieuwsgier gave the story of one young man, from Bengkulu, who had come to Java to study, been robbed of all his possessions while in Jakarta, then been helped by PahWongso to find work.|$|E

25|$|Historians {{have paid}} special {{attention}} to the efforts by Nazi Germany to reverse the gains women made before 1933, especially in the relatively liberal Weimar Republic. It appears {{the role of women in}} Nazi Germany changed according to circumstances. Theoretically the Nazis believed that women must be subservient to men, avoid careers, devote themselves to childbearing and child-rearing, and be a helpmate of the traditional dominant father in the traditional family. However, before 1933, women played important roles in the Nazi organization and were allowed some autonomy to mobilize other women. After Hitler came to power in 1933, the activist women were replaced by bureaucratic women who emphasized feminine virtues, marriage, and childbirth. As Germany prepared for war, large numbers were incorporated into the public sector and with the need for full mobilization of factories by 1943, all women were required to register with the <b>employment</b> <b>office.</b> Women's wages remained unequal and women were denied positions of leadership or control.|$|E

He eventually applied for a discharge from the army and decided to settle in Victoria. Later he moved to Tasmania where he took a job with the government and became a civil servant. He also became involved in the Boy Scouts and in 1933 he served as secretary and organiser of the first World Scout Jamboree to be held in Australia, taking place over Christmas 1933–34. On 28 April 1939, while he was working with the Youth <b>Employment</b> <b>Office</b> in Hobart, Harcourt was involved in a motor vehicle accident at Kings Meadows, Launceston. While attempting to take evasive action to avoid hitting a car that was driving {{on the wrong side of}} the road, Harcourt's car collided with a pedestrian who had been walking on the road. Although Harcourt rushed the pedestrian, an eight-year-old boy, to hospital, the boy's injuries proved fatal. An inquest was subsequently held and found that Harcourt was in no way to blame for the accident.|$|E
25|$|The Boarman family home, {{commonly}} known as the Boarman House, is an historical landmark in the state of West Virginia. It {{is one of the oldest}} brick buildings in downtown Martinsburg and part of the city's walking tour of Civil War landmarks. Originally built by Philip Nadenbousch, it was purchased by Lieutenant Charles Boarman in 1832 and remained in the Boarman family for over a century before being sold to the King’s Daughters Circle in December 1943, and then to the Sisters of the Holy Ghost in 1953; the building was used for apartments and various offices, including an <b>employment</b> <b>office</b> for returning World War II servicemen, during this time. It was purchased in 1980 by West Virginia nonprofit corporation Associates for Community Development and, after extensive restorations, housed the Boarman Arts Center and the Martinsburg-Berkeley County Convention and Visitors Bureau from 1987 to 2001; the building featured Boarman's navigator's log and two portraits, one when he bought the house as a young lieutenant and the other as an older officer. In October 2005, the house was sold to a Leesburg, Virginia couple, Chester and Jeanne Martin, who planned to turn it into the city's first bed and breakfast.|$|E
