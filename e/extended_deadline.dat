Both Russia and U.S. missed the CWC's <b>extended</b> <b>deadline</b> of April 2012 to destroy all of their chemical weapons.

Chemical weapons destruction resumed in 2015 with expected completion by 2023.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{a delayed}} reform {{schedule}} and a worsened economic recession, {{the new government}} immediately asked the Troika to be granted an <b>extended</b> <b>deadline</b> from 2015 to 2017 before being required to restore the budget into a self-financed situation; which in effect was equal to a request of a third bailout package for 2015–16 worth €32.6bn of extra loans. On 11 November 2012, facing a default {{by the end of}} November, the Greek parliament passed a new austerity package worth €18.8bn, including a [...] "labour market reform" [...] and [...] "midterm fiscal plan 2013–16". In return, the Eurogroup agreed on the following day to lower interest rates and prolong debt maturities and to provide Greece with additional funds of around €10bn for a debt-buy-back programme. The latter allowed Greece to retire about half of the [...] in debt that Athens owes private creditors, thereby shaving roughly [...] off that debt. This should bring Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio down to 124% by 2020 and well below 110% two years later. Without agreement the debt-to-GDP ratio would have risen to 188% in 2013.|$|E

2500|$|The novel {{has a very}} {{different}} tone from the previous books in the series. This is partly {{because it is a}} romance, and partly because the book bounces around in time more erratically than its predecessors. Adams even injects a humorous sub-plot. There is less outer-space time than in the previous books; Arthur leaves the new Earth only in the final chapters. The different tone also reflects the rushed nature of the writing; Adams' editor Sonny Mehta moved in with the author to ensure that the book met its (<b>extended)</b> <b>deadline.</b> As a result, Adams later stated that he was not entirely happy with the book, which includes several jarring authorial intrusions, which fellow author and Adams' biographer Neil Gaiman described as [...] "patronising and unfair".|$|E
2500|$|Hainkel was an {{opponent}} of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which was rejected in a key House committee in 1976. When the ERA failed to gain ratification after an <b>extended</b> <b>deadline,</b> Hainkel, then Speaker, addressed a gathering of the opponents held in Baton Rouge on June 30, 1982. Hainkel noted that many states [...] "unthinkingly" [...] ratified the ERA when it passed Congress early in 1972 because that [...] "was the thing to do" [...] then. Hainkel said that he objected to placing accession rights and family law subservient to federal law. [...] "Already in this state, credit laws have been changed, head and master changed to joint management, and through commerce and economics, we've addressed ourselves to problems. We've had increased equality {{on the basis of}} sex, but we've had it in the proper form, handled in the statutes of this state," [...] Hainkel said.|$|E

2500|$|More {{than the}} disapproval {{of all the}} four states of the new expert {{committee}} that was proposed, the proposal {{turned out to be}} a major embarrassment for the tribunal. [...] This was because, not only were the four states opposed to it even the Chief Judge of the tribunal was opposed to it. [...] However the other two assistant judges on 3-man adjudication team, overruled the opinion of the main Judge. [...] And all this was done in a packed courtroom and this led to petty bickering and heated arguments between the three judges in the packed courtroom. [...] This left everyone in the courtroom shocked and the Tamil Nadu counsel was moved to remark that it was embarrassing that the judges probably needed help settling their own disputes before adjudicating on the dispute at hand. [...] Nonetheless, the new expert committee was formed and carried out further assessments. [...] Subsequently, the <b>extended</b> <b>deadline</b> of the tribunal also passed and the tribunal was given yet another extension.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the post-electoral {{controversy}} {{revolved around}} Gore's request for hand recounts in four counties (Broward, Miami Dade, Palm Beach, and Volusia), as provided under Florida state law. Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris (also the co-chair of George W. Bush's election efforts in Florida) announced she would reject any revised totals from those counties {{if they were}} not turned in by 5:00p.m. on November 14, the statutory deadline for amended returns. The Florida Supreme Court extended the deadline to November 26, a decision later vacated by the U.S. Supreme Court. Miami-Dade eventually halted its recount and resubmitted its original total to the state canvassing board, while Palm Beach County failed to meet the <b>extended</b> <b>deadline,</b> turning in its completed recount results at 7:00p.m., which Harris indeed rejected. On November 26, the state canvassing board certified Bush the winner of Florida's electors by 537 votes. Gore formally contested the certified results. A state court decision overruling Gore was reversed by the Florida Supreme Court, which ordered a recount of over 70,000 ballots previously rejected as undervotes by machine counters. The U.S. Supreme Court halted that order the next day, with Justice Scalia issuing a concurring opinion that [...] "the counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to petitioner" [...] (Bush).|$|E
