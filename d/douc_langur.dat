40|$|Black-shanked <b>douc</b> <b>langurs</b> (Pygathrix nigripes) are Southeast Asian colobines {{about which}} primatologists know very little, {{but they are}} classed as {{endangered}} because of population decline due to habitat loss. Two preliminary {{studies have shown that}} this monkey is primarily folivorous, but there are few details of plant selection or seasonal changes in diet. We set out to observe <b>douc</b> <b>langurs</b> directly in the wild to quantify the diet during wet and dry seasons. We confirmed that the species relies on foliage throughout the year, but it includes significant proportions of fruit and flowers in its diet when those items are available. The <b>douc</b> <b>langurs</b> selected various parts from 152 species of plants in 2 national parks, but there {{did not appear to be}} favorite species that were heavily selected over others. In both the wet and dry seasons, the black-shanked <b>douc</b> <b>langurs</b> ate mostly leaves, but the diversity of plants consumed increased and the proportion of fruit eaten almost doubled in the wet season. There were diurnal shifts in food selection, but we found no evidence that the <b>douc</b> <b>langurs</b> were foraging strategically to maximize their protein or energy intake...|$|R

50|$|Bạch Mã National Park covers 22030 ha, and {{comprises}} three {{zones of}} a strictly protected core area, {{an administrative area}} and a buffer zone. Its habitat types vary from coastal lagoons to montane forest. The Mount Bạch Mã mountain is located within the park. It is the wettest park in Vietnam recording an annual rainfall of 7977 mm, It is considered a 'Centre of Plant Diversity' in Vietnam. The main vegetation type reported consists of moist evergreen forest and montane forest and scrub and grasslands. The park has endemic subspecies of silver pheasant (Lophura nycthemera beli) and Edwards's pheasant (Lophura edwardsi). Asian elephant, white-cheeked gibbons and red-shanked <b>douc</b> <b>langurs</b> are the mammal species recorded but detailed list of mammals in the park {{is yet to be}} prepared. Of the 43 bird species, endemic species of crested argus, the Annam partridge and Edwards's pheasant are reported.|$|R

50|$|Uhlenbroek {{introduces}} the second episode from amongst gelada baboons in the Simien Mountains of Ethiopia, demonstrating how monkeys are athletic, adaptable and social animals. The smallest monkeys are the marmosets and tamarins of South America and are unusual amongst primate because the fathers {{do most of}} the parenting. The pygmy marmoset and tassle-eared marmoset are shown. Other New World species are shown: spider monkeys, squirrel monkeys and black howler monkeys. Uhlenbroek calls to the howlers and ascends into the canopy to view them at close quarters. Monkeys originated in the Old World, and it is here that the greatest diversity of species are found. The black-and-white colobus of East Africa are leaf-eaters. Leaves contain many toxins, but the red colobus of Zanzibar have found an antidote in the form of charcoal. Diana monkeys belong to the guenons, a shy group of monkeys from the West African jungles. The patchwork jungle has led to many different species of guenon evolving. In South East Asia, the proboscis monkey eats tough mangrove leaves which it digests by fermentation. The langurs are another leaf-eating group: silvered monkeys from Malaysia, <b>douc</b> <b>langurs</b> from Vietnam and the rare golden monkeys of central China are all shown. Back in Africa, Uhlenbroek explains that it is the monkeys that have come out of the forest to live on the ground that are the most intelligent and have the most sophisticated societies as shown by the patas monkey and olive baboon.|$|R
40|$|Primates of the Colobinae {{subfamily}} {{are highly}} folivorous. They possess a sacculated foregut and {{are believed to}} rely on a specialized gut microbiota to extract sufficient energy from their hard-to-digest diet. Although many colobines are endangered and would benefit from captive breeding programs, maintaining healthy captive populations of colobines can be difficult since they commonly suffer from morbidity and mortality due to gastrointestinal (GI) distress of unknown cause. While there is speculation that this GI distress may be associated with a dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, no study has directly examined the role of the gut microbiota in colobine GI health. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing to examine the gut microbiota of three genera of colobines housed at the San Diego Zoo: doucs (Pygathrix) (N= 7), colobus monkeys (Colobus) (N= 4), and langurs (Trachypithecus) (N= 5). Our data indicated that GI-healthy <b>doucs,</b> <b>langurs,</b> and colobus monkeys possess a distinct gut microbiota. In addition, GI-unhealthy doucs exhibited a different gut microbiota compared to GI-healthy individuals, including reduced relative abundances of anti-inflammatory Akkermansia. Finally, by comparing samples from wild and captive Asian colobines, we found that captive colobines generally exhibited higher relative abundances of potential pathogens such as Desulfovibrio and Methanobrevibacter compared to wild colobines, implying an increased risk of gut microbial dysbiosis. Together, these results suggest an association between the gut microbiota and GI illness of unknown cause in doucs. Further studies are necessary to corroborate these findings and determine cause-and-effect relationships. Additionally, we found minimal variation in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota along the colobine GI tract, suggesting that fecal samples may be sufficient for describing the colobine gut microbiota. If these findings can be validated in wild individuals, it will facilitate the rapid expansion of colobine gut microbiome research...|$|R
