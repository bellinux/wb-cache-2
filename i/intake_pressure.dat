25|$|Throttle lag {{occurs because}} turbochargers {{rely on the}} buildup of exhaust gas {{pressure}} to drive the turbine. In variable output systems such as automobile engines, exhaust gas pressure at idle, low engine speeds, or low throttle is usually insufficient to drive the turbine. Only when the engine reaches sufficient speed does the turbine section start to spool up, or spin fast enough to produce <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> above atmospheric pressure.|$|E
25|$|Supersonic {{pressure}} recovery is {{addressed by the}} number of shock waves that are generated by the intake, the greater the number the higher the {{pressure recovery}}. Supersonic flow is compressed or slowed by changes in direction. The Concorde intake front ramps changed the flow direction causing oblique external shocks and isentropic compression in the supersonic flow. The TSR-2 had used a half-cone translating centre-body to change the direction. Subsonic pressure recovery is addressed by removal of the boundary layer (at the ramp bleed slot) and suitable shaping of the subsonic diffuser leading to the engine. The high pressure recovery for the Concorde intake at cruise gave an <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> ratio of 7.3:1.|$|E
25|$|As flight speed {{increases}} supersonically {{the shock}} system is initially external. For the SR-71 this was until about M1.6 to M1.8 and M2 for the XB-70. The intake {{is said to}} be unstarted. Further increase in speed produces supersonic speeds inside the duct with a plane shock near the throat. The intake {{is said to be}} started. Upstream or downstream disturbances, such as gusts/atmospheric temperature gradients and engine airflow changes, both intentional and unintentional(from surging), tend to cause the shock to be expelled almost instantaneously. Expulsion of the shock, known as an unstart, causes all the supersonic compression to take place externally through a single plane shock. The intake has changed in a split second from its most efficient configuration with most of its supersonic compression taking place inside the duct to the least efficient as shown by the large loss in pressure recovery, from about 80% to about 20% at M3 flight speeds. There is a large drop in <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> and loss in thrust together with temporary loss of control of the aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Like {{all such}} scoops, {{its purpose is}} to {{increase}} performance at high speed by a 'ram air' effect, delivering high pressure air to the engine. Unfortunately engines draw air in hundreds of cubic feet per minute so scoops are not practical to raise <b>intake</b> <b>pressures</b> significantly. Other benefits of a shaker hood include elevation to prevent water from being drawn on flooded terrain, a cooler source of air, and a more direct path to the engine's throttle plate.|$|R

2500|$|By comparison, a {{turbocharger}} {{does not}} place a direct mechanical {{load on the}} engine, although turbochargers place exhaust back pressure on engines, increasing pumping losses. This is more efficient because while the increased back pressure taxes the piston exhaust stroke, much of the energy driving the turbine {{is provided by the}} still-expanding exhaust gas that would otherwise be wasted as heat through the tailpipe. In contrast to supercharging, the primary disadvantage of turbocharging is what is referred to as [...] "lag" [...] or [...] "spool time". This is the time between the demand for an increase in power (the throttle being opened) and the turbocharger(s) providing increased <b>intake</b> <b>pressure,</b> and hence increased power.|$|E

40|$|The {{homogeneous}} charge {{compression ignition}} (HCCI) engine {{is an attractive}} technology because of its high efficiency and low emissions. However, HCCI lacks a direct combustion trigger making control of combustion timing challenging, especially during transients. To aid in HCCI engine control we present a simple model of the HCCI combustion process valid over a range of <b>intake</b> <b>pressures,</b> <b>intake</b> temperatures, equivalence ratios, and engine speeds. The model provides {{an estimate of the}} combustion timing on a cycle-by-cycle basis.

40|$|On {{turbocharged}} spark-ignited (SI) engines with wastegate {{the position}} of the wastegate changes the exhaust manifold pressure. A secondary effect of this is that the residual gas mass trapped inside the cylinder at exhaust valve closing changes and causes the volumetric efficiency to change. The volumetric efficiency is used to estimate air-mass-to-cylinder which is important for good air/fuel ratio control. Air-mass to-cylinder is not directly measurable so observers for air-mass flow to the cylinder are therefore often proposed. For observers with one state for <b>intake</b> manifold <b>pressure</b> and proportional feed-back from measured state, there is a tradeoff whether to estimate <b>intake</b> manifold <b>pressure</b> or air-mass-tocylinder. A new nonlinear air-mass-to-cylinder observer is suggested with two states: one for <b>intake</b> manifold <b>pressure</b> and one for the in-cylinder air-mass offset compared to expected using the volumetric efficiency. The exhaust manifold pressure can change rapidly in an engine with wastegate...|$|R

50|$|A {{sequential}} turbo {{can also}} be of use to a system where the output pressure must be greater than can be provided by a single turbo, commonly called a staged twin turbo system. In this case, multiple similarly sized turbochargers are used in sequence, but both operate constantly. The first turbo boosts pressure {{as much as possible}} (for example to three times the <b>intake</b> <b>pressure).</b> Subsequent turbos take the charge from the previous stage and compresses it further (for example to an additional three times <b>intake</b> <b>pressure,</b> for a total boost of nine times atmospheric pressure). This configuration is commonly found on piston engine aircraft which usually do not need to rapidly raise and lower engine speed (and thus where turbo lag is not a primary design consideration), and where the <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> is quite low due to low atmospheric pressure at altitude, requiring a very high pressure ratio. High-performance diesel engines also sometimes use this configuration, since diesel engines do not suffer from pre-ignition issues and can use significantly higher boost pressure than Otto cycle engines.|$|E
50|$|In {{turbocharged}} and supercharged engines {{with potential}} for abundant torque, an <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> regulation system often limits torque to a near-constant figure across the {{engine speed range}} to reduce stresses on the engine and provide consistent handling without decreasing peak power.|$|E

The results of a comparison made between model configurations with nominal combustion-chamber intake Mach numbers of 4 and 6 indicated that the hypersonic duct gives a better performance at flight enthalpies above 7 mJ/kg. It is argued that the lower temperatures associated with hypersonic flow produce more efficient combustion...|$|R
40|$|Observers for {{air mass}} flow to the {{cylinder}} is studied on a turbocharged SI-engine with wastegate. A position change of the wastegate influences the residual gas mass and causes the volumetric efficiency to change, which produces a transient in the {{air mass flow}} to the cylinder. Two standard methods of estimating air-to-cylinder are investigated. A new nonlinear air-to-cylinder observer is suggested with two states: one for <b>intake</b> manifold <b>pressure</b> {{and one for the}} offset in in-cylinder air mass compared to expected through the volumetric efficiency.

40|$|Stronger {{environmental}} awareness {{as well as}} actual and future legislations increase the demands on diagnosis and supervision of any vehicle with a combustion engine. Particularly this concerns heavy duty trucks, where it is common with long driving distances and large engines. Model based diagnosis is an often used method in these applications, since {{it does not require}} any hardware redundancy. Undesired changes in the <b>intake</b> manifold <b>pressure</b> can cause increased emissions. In this thesis a diagnosis system for supervision of the <b>intake</b> manifold <b>pressure</b> is constructed and evaluated. The diagnosis system is based on a Mean Value Engine Model (MVEM) of the <b>intake</b> manifold <b>pressure</b> in a diesel engine with Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) and Variable Geometry Turbine (VGT). The observer-based residual generator is a comparison between the measured <b>intake</b> manifold <b>pressure</b> and the observer based estimation of this pressure. The generated residual is then post treated in the CUSUM algorithm based diagnosis test. When constructing the diagnosis system, robustness is an important aspect. To achieve a robust system design, four different observer approaches are evaluated. The four approaches are extended Kalman filter, high-gain, sliding mode and an adaption of the open model. The conclusion of this evaluation is that a sliding mode approach is the best alternative to get a robust diagnosis system in this application. The CUSUM algorithm in the diagnosis test improves the properties of the diagnosis system further...|$|R

50|$|The series {{arrangement}}, {{the more}} common arrangement of twinchargers, is set up such that one compressor's (turbo or supercharger) output feeds the inlet of another. A sequentially-organized supercharger is connected to a medium- to large-sized turbocharger. The supercharger provides near-instant manifold pressure (eliminating turbo lag, which would otherwise result when the turbocharger {{is not up to}} its operating speed). Once the turbocharger has reached operating speed, the supercharger can either continue compounding the pressurized air to the turbocharger inlet (yielding elevated <b>intake</b> <b>pressures),</b> or it can be bypassed and/or mechanically decoupled from the drivetrain via an electromagnetic clutch and bypass valve (increasing efficiency of the induction system).|$|R

50|$|Forced {{induction}} {{is used in}} {{the automotive}} and aviation industry to increase engine power and efficiency. A forced induction engine is essentially two compressors in series. The compression stroke of the engine is the main compression that every engine has. An additional compressor feeding into the intake of the engine causes forced induction of air. A compressor feeding pressure into another greatly increases the total compression ratio of the entire system. This <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> is called boost. This particularly helps aviation engines, as they need to operate at higher altitudes with lower air densities.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{commonly}} related that [...] "stand off" [...] (air-fuel mix that gets pushed {{back out of}} the port, usually at full throttle / low rpm) is somehow captured by installing a longer intake pipe (stack). but, it is actually that the intake valve is closing too late and the combustion chamber is simply overfilling and blowing back out the intake port, before the intake valve closes. A longer inlet pipe will create a later <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> wave that will help keep the air in the chamber until the intake valve closes.|$|E
50|$|As flight speed {{builds up}} after take-off, the ram {{rise in the}} intake starts to have a {{significant}} effect upon nozzle pressure/temperature and intake airflow, causing nozzle gross thrust to climb more rapidly. This term now starts to offset the still increasing ram drag, eventually causing net thrust to start to increase. In some engines, the net thrust at say Mach 1.0, sea level can even be slightly greater than the static thrust. Above Mach 1.0, with a subsonic inlet design, shock losses tend to decrease net thrust, however a suitably designed supersonic inlet can give a lower reduction in <b>intake</b> <b>pressure</b> recovery, allowing net thrust to continue to climb in the supersonic regime.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A single {{cylinder}} engine with ability to controlled auto-ignition (CAI) combustion was used in order to study cycle-by-cycle combustion variability. The engine was operated in negative valve overlap (NVO) mode resulting with an internal gas re-circulation. Direct gasoline injection was applied in a single dose during the NVO period. Various <b>intake</b> <b>pressures</b> were applied, ranging from atmospheric aspiration to 0. 15 MPa boost pressure. The combustion timing was examined in terms of 5 % mass fraction burnt (MFB). Experimental results showed that cyclic variations of 5 % MFB demonstrate deterministic oscillations under boosted operation.

Moreover intermittent combustion behavior was demonstrated {{with the use of}} recurrence plots...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: For air/fuel control, {{where the}} {{cylinder}} air charge (CAC) estimation {{is based on}} <b>intake</b> manifold <b>pressure,</b> {{it is essential to}} reduce the noise from measured <b>intake</b> manifold <b>pressure</b> signals {{while at the same time}} keeping the phase delays low during transients. Observers provide means of filtering without introducing large delays and therefore an observer is developed with emphasis on CAC estimation for air/fuel ratio control. It also enables model based diagnosis opportunities. The observer is based on a nonlinear mean value engine model including the intake and exhaust side together with turbine shaft speed. The observer feedback gains are determined using an extended Kalman filter. Systematic methods are presented to determine the covariance matrices for the noise and as part of that a novel method is presented to determine the state noise based on the model quality. Additional performance benefits are demonstrated when the model is augmented with one state. The observer is evaluated using real engine data with feedback from measured <b>pressures</b> in the <b>intake</b> manifold and after the intercooler. It shows very good results for CAC estimation as it suppresses <b>intake</b> manifold <b>pressure</b> noise without introducing phase delays. It also provides an accurate estimate of turbocharger speed. Therefore it is highly suitable for control and diagnosis in turbocharged SI-engines...|$|R
