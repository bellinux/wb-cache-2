5|$|Already as a teenager, Sorabji {{took great}} {{interest}} in recent developments in art music—in the work of Schoenberg, Scriabin, Mahler and Debussy, among others—at {{a time when they}} received scant attention in the United Kingdom.

5|$|Each evening, Texas {{retired from}} her {{bombardment}} position close to Okinawa, but returned {{the next morning}} to resume her bombardments. The enemy ashore, preparing for a defense-in-depth strategy as at Iwo Jima, made no answer. Only air units provided a response, as several kamikaze raids were sent to harass the bombardment group. Texas escaped damage during those attacks. On 1 April, after six days of aerial and naval bombardment, the ground troops went ashore, and for almost two months, Texas remained in Okinawan waters providing gunfire support for the troops and fending off the enemy aerial assault. <b>In</b> <b>performing</b> the latter mission, she claimed one kamikaze kill on her own and claimed three assists.

5|$|In February 1866, having briefly {{served at}} Iași's Pantelimon Church, he was welcomed by hegumen Isaia Vicol Dioclias {{into the service}} of Golia Monastery.

After that moment, Creangă began losing {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>performing</b> his duties in the clergy, and, while {{doing his best to}} hide that he was no longer living with his wife, took a mistress. The marriage's breakup was later attributed by Creangă himself to Ileana's adulterous affair with a Golia monk, and rumors spread that Ileana's lover was a high-ranking official, the protopope of Iași. Creangă's accusations, Călinescu contends, are nevertheless dubious, because the deacon persisted in working for the same monastery after the alleged incident.|$|E

5|$|His {{introduction}} to films was unusual. When visiting an aunt {{who lived in}} Brooklyn opposite Vitagraph Studios, Cagney would climb over the fence to watch the filming of John Bunny movies. He became involved in amateur dramatics, starting as a scenery boy for a Chinese pantomime at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, {{one of the first}} settlement houses in the nation, where his brother Harry performed and his soon-to-be friend, Florence James, directed. He was initially content working behind the scenes and had no interest <b>in</b> <b>performing.</b> One night, however, Harry became ill, and although Cagney was not an understudy, his photographic memory of rehearsals enabled him to stand in for his brother without making a single mistake. Therefore, Florence James has the unique distinction of being the first director to put him on a stage. Afterward, he joined a number of companies as a performer in a variety of roles.|$|E
