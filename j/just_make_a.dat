Miller stated that the tone will be the same as the first two films. Cameron and Miller jointly acknowledged that the focus of the film is not to create more sequels or generate revenue, but to instead create the proper sequel, with the goal being to <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> good movie. However, there is a plan for a trilogy that would conclude the story should this first film prove successful.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{previous}} albums, Subterranean Jungle {{shifted the}} band's sound output focus towards {{getting back to}} their punk rock roots, {{rather than trying to}} expand fan-base by releasing more pop-oriented songs. This change is due to guitarist Johnny Ramone obtaining more priority over the style choice. Johnny felt as though the band needed to [...] "be focused and stop worrying about getting played [...] and <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> good record." [...] Since lead singer Joey Ramone was not given as much stylistic freedom, the album lacks the sense of pop-influence which previous releases had contained and instead was shaped mostly by Johnny's hard rock background.|$|E

They decided the two should get married after dating for only a short time because it was funny, it made sense with the characters' personalities, and it raised the stakes for future stories involving the two.

500|$|The 1974 {{documentary}} film Hearts and Minds, which {{was critical of}} the United States' role in the Vietnam War, featured Coker briefly. Coker, {{at the time of}} filming, had recently returned from {{six and a half years}} of internment in North Vietnamese camps for American prisoners of war– where he had endured torture and other mistreatment by his captors. The film shows a homecoming parade in his honor in his hometown of Linden, New Jersey, where he tells the assembled crowd on the steps of city hall that if the need arose, that they must be ready to send him back to war. Answering a student's question about what Vietnam looked like, he responded: [...] "Well, if it wasn't for the people, it was very pretty. The people over there are very backward and very primitive, and they <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> mess out of everything." [...] Time magazine's Stefan Kanfer criticized the lack of balance in the film's portrayal of Coker, noting that [...] "he camera, which amply records the agonies of South Vietnamese political prisoners, seems uninterested in the American lieutenant's experience of humiliation and torture." ...|$|E

500|$|Brian Linder of IGN commented [...] "2004's Greatest Hits: My Prerogative [...] {{captured}} the highlights from Britney's heyday, but lacks the more mature club-oriented material that she's churned out in recent years.

Mike Diver of BBC Online called it [...] "the definitive Britney album" [...] {{and added that}} [...] "these songs don't <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> mark, lingering in the memory– they are essential pieces of {{the past ten years}} of pop history, and deserve better than dismissal by so-called discerning listeners". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called the album [...] "a high-gloss collection of tunes that selectively sums up the career of one of the biggest female pop singers of the past decade. It's a disc that's light on filler [...] and heavy on Spears' more high-energy cuts, which, without question, play to her strengths as a performer". Sputnikmusic stated [...] "This is Britney's second greatest hits, and it's incredibly strong. It focuses mainly on her more upbeat, danceable numbers, with a few slower ones thrown in to change things up without disrupting the constant stream of quality pop songs" [...] and summarized the review adding [...] "As {{one of the most successful}} artists of the decade, is it any wonder this compilation is so good?".|$|E

In speaking on [...] "Sorry"'s release, Ciara stated that she viewed it and its follow-up [...] "Got Me Good" [...] as the album's dual lead singles, stating [...] "Those two <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> cool marriage. ‘Got Me Good’ is living in the moment of being ‘Got Good’.
