40|$|This review {{considers}} {{factors affecting}} the coexistence of closely related pathogen species on arable crops, with particular reference to data available at Rothamsted for Septoria tritici/Stagonospora nodorum (Mycosphaerella graminicola/Phaeosphaeria nodorum) (septoria leaf blotch diseases on winter wheat), Oculimacula yallundae/O. acuformis (<b>eyespot</b> disease <b>of</b> winter <b>cereals),</b> and Leptosphaeria maculans/L. biglobosa (phoma stem canker on winter oilseed rape). Factors affecting the short-term, medium-term, and long-term coexistence of such related pathogen species are reviewed, and their evolution from common ancestors considered. Small niche {{differences between the}} related pathogen species enable them to coexist on the same host. The niche differences result from small differences in their biology/epidemiology, leading to separation in space, time, or resource use. Changes in both natural (e. g., fluctuating temperature) and manmade (e. g., agronomic practices, pollution) factors influence the coexistence. Such factors may result in coexistence between the related species {{in some parts of}} the world, whereas in other parts only one species occurs. These principles illustrated with pathogens of arable crops are generic to other host-pathogen systems...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze the {{regional}} distribution <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> production, trade and consumption. Significant regional differences were registered with regard to output, structure and dynamics <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> production, trade and consumption from the standpoint of both continents and countries of the world. The differences may be attributed to numerous natural, social and economic factors. Countries having favorable environmental and climatic conditions, enhanced social, economic, scientific technical and technological standards are leading in both world production and export <b>of</b> <b>cereals.</b> In addition, thanks to the high standards of living the consumption <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> per capita in these countries is known to be comparatively low in relation to commodities of animal origin. On the other hand, underdeveloped and developing countries having unfavorable climatic conditions are known to produce a smaller part <b>of</b> the world <b>cereals</b> and to absorb a greater part of the world import <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> based commodities. Due to the lower living standard these countries are known to be considerable consumers <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> per capita whereas the consumption of commodities of animal origin is considerably low...|$|R

In this case, Dll expression that regulates the size <b>of</b> <b>eyespot</b> bodies probably coincides to a certain extent with the expression of unknown genes that regulate the size of white areas. Indeed, white spots are not likely affected much in Dll-deleted wings (Zhang and Reed 2016).|$|R

40|$|The {{nutritional}} quality <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> foods {{is directly related}} to the nature of nutrient storage in cereal grains. Most cereal nutrients, such as carbohydrates and minerals, are st ructurally bound. Processing alters the structural organization <b>of</b> the <b>cereal</b> grain. Results obtained from many nutritional studies indicate that the structure and physical form <b>of</b> a <b>cereal</b> food greatly influence the availability of its nutrients. Using oats and wheat as examples, this review demonstrates how microscopy contributes to understanding the relationship between cereal structures and the availability <b>of</b> nutrients in <b>cereal</b> foods. Various forms of food microscopy play important roles in revealing structural changes <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> foods that result from processing, cooking and enzymatic reactions. These changes directly affect the digestibility of starch, phytate and dietary fiber in oats and wheat. The present review also examines the effects of undigested fiber and phytate on the absorption of minerals in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. Food Microscopy is a potential tool for studying the mineral binding property <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> bran components...|$|R
