40|$|The {{apparent}} subunit {{sizes for}} pili of gonococci (Gc) have been visualized by using either Iodogen 125 I-labeled whole Gc or immunoblotting with antipilus antiserum.

40|$|The "classical model" for sexually {{transmitted}} infections treats partnerships as instantaneous events summarized by partner change rates, while individual-based and pair models explicitly account for time within partnerships and gaps between partnerships. We compared predictions from the classical and pair models over {{a range of}} partnership and gap combinations. While the former predicted similar or marginally higher prevalence at the shortest partnership lengths, the latter predicted self-sustaining transmission <b>for</b> gonorrhoea (<b>GC)</b> and Chlamydia (CT) over much broader partnership and gap combinations. Predictions on the critical level of condom use (C(c)) required to prevent transmission also differed substantially when using the same parameters.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{disentangle}} the relation between GC exception in the Emphasis of Matter of unqualified opinion, modified opinion <b>for</b> <b>GC</b> and the opening of insolvency proceedings. Using a unique hand-collected database on audit opinions of 326 Italian listed companies from 2007 to 2011, we analyze audit opinions first using a GLM with fixed effects and then we test our results adopting a hierarchical model with random effects. First, we find that the probability of opening an insolvency proceeding is higher following a modified opinion <b>for</b> <b>GC</b> than after a GC exception in the Emphasis of Matter of an unqualified opinion. Second, we identify a positive and significant relationship between a GC exception reported in the Emphasis of Matter of unqualified opinion at time (t- 1) and a modified opinion <b>for</b> <b>GC</b> at time (t). Overall, the findings suggest that going concern opinions have to be disentangled to really understand the risk of default.

With the exception of GCG, which did not differ among developmental stages, the highest concentrations of individual catechins were in new shoots. Furthermore, for new shoots, a general increase in the levels of individual catechins and total catechins was observed with increasing age of the leaves with an exception of C, whose concentration is highest in the buds. These results are similar with the results of two other studies (Eungwanichayapant and Popluechai 2009; Wei et al. 2011). In contrast, the total catechins in C. sinensis var. sinensis cultivar Zhenong 139 were found to slightly decline with increasing age of the leaves (Mamati et al. 2006). These differences might be explained by genetic variations or differences in the methods of cultivation, post-harvest treatment, environment or agricultural practices (Eungwanichayapant and Popluechai 2009; Wei et al. 2011).|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Acute {{cholecystitis}} is {{a common}} surgical condition, but not many {{are aware of the}} serious complication of gangrenous cholecystitis (GC). Presence of GC increases patients’ postoperative complications, morbidity and mortality. Predictive factors <b>for</b> <b>GC</b> include age > 45, male gender, white blood cell count > 13, 000 /mm 3 and ultrasound findings of a negative Murphy’s sign. Case presentation: (1) GW, 83 male with dull right upper quadrant pain and a negative Murphy’s sign with further imaging showing a thickened septated gallbladder suggestive of GC. Patient’s surgery was difficult and he received a cholecystostomy tube for drainage. (2) PH, 75 male with minimal right upper quadrant pain, equivocal ultrasound with a negative Murphy’s sign and computer tomography (CT) showing acute cholecystitis. Patient was taken to the operating room for cholecystectomy, with pathology consistent with gangrenous cholecystitis. Discussion: Multiple laboratory findings and imaging patterns {{have been found to be}} highly predictive of GC. Along with age and WBC, thickened gallbladder wall and lack of mucosal enhancement have been predictive of GC. On physical examination, lack of Murphy’s sign secondary to denervation from gangrenous changes also increases the index of suspicion <b>for</b> <b>GC.</b> Conclusion: GC is a serious complication of acute cholecystitis with increased morbidity and mortality.

40|$|The {{control of}} plant {{parasitic}} nematodes {{is an increasing}} problem. A key process during the infection is the induction of specialized nourishing cells, called giant cells (GCs), in roots. Understanding the function of genes required <b>for</b> <b>GC</b> development is crucial to identify targets for new control strategies. We propose a standardized method <b>for</b> <b>GC</b> phenotyping in different plant genotypes, like those with modified genes essential <b>for</b> <b>GC</b> development. The method combines images obtained by bright-field microscopy from the complete serial sectioning of galls with TrakEM 2, specialized three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction software for biological structures. The volumes and shapes from 162 3 D models of individual GCs induced by Meloidogyne javanica in Arabidopsis were analyzed {{for the first time}} along their life cycle. A high correlation between the combined volume of all GCs within a gall and the total area occupied by all the GCs in the section/s where they show maximum expansion, and a proof of concept from two Arabidopsis transgenic lines (J 0121 >> DTA and J 0121 >> GFP) demonstrate the reliability of the method. We phenotyped GCs and developed a reliable simplified method based on a two-dimensional (2 D) parameter <b>for</b> comparison of <b>GCs</b> from different Arabidopsis genotypes, which is also applicable to galls from different plant species and in different growing conditions, as thickness/transparency is not a restriction...|$|R

Identifying individual risk factors <b>for</b> repeated <b>GC</b> infection is essential so that infection control programs can develop better strategies for decreasing the incidence of GC infection.
