30|$|One {{possible}} {{approach to}} effectively model {{this type of}} problem (multilane and multiclass) could be microsimulation, in which single vehicle trajectories are modelled with a small time step resolution and with their interaction on the road. An extensive review of traffic modelling approaches {{can be found in}} [9], whereas a microsimulation model application example is reported by [10]. Although the microsimulation approach meets the principal requirements of the traffic model for CWD, it does not model vehicle behavior according to their energy needs. The current SOC level of the vehicles and the fleet operators’ eventual SOC target requirements influence drivers’ decisions concerning lane changing, i.e., vehicles try to enter into the charging lane or to exit according to their needs. Therefore, specific rules must be defined and implemented to obtain realistic results from the traffic model. In addition, the <b>detailed</b> <b>rules</b> <b>implemented</b> in a micro-simulation model usually require an accurate calibration process, aimed at replicating the actual driving in traffic. However, the calibration process can be compromised in a CWD scenario whenever various ADAS are available on-board because they affect driving and traffic. Consequently, a mesoscopic approach would be more accurate than a microscopic one, because the latter is too detailed for this preliminary stage of CWD technology. Further comments on this issue will be reported in Sect.  3. A framework of mesoscopic traffic models can be found in [11], whereas a recent application of this type of model was proposed in [12].|$|R
