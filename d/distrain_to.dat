50|$|Hot pursuit {{has long}} formed {{a part of}} English common law. The {{principle}} {{can be traced back}} to the doctrine of distress damage feasant, which allowed a property owner to detain animals trespassing on his land to ensure that he was compensated for the damage they had caused (though only during the trespass itself). In particular, a case in 1293 held that a property owner could also chase after trespassing animals leaving his land and catch them if he could.

50|$|In mortgages, an {{attornment}} clause is a clause whereby the mortgagor attorns tenant to the mortgagee, thus giving the mortgagee the right <b>to</b> <b>distrain,</b> {{as an additional}} security. As used in modern legal transactions, the term attornment refers to an acknowledgment {{of the existence of}} the relationship of landlord and tenant. A tenant often has the duty under the tenant's lease, particularly in commercial leases, to provide an attornment upon request, and is required by a creditor or potential buyer of property from the landlord to establish the nature of existing encumbrances on and income streams flowing from a property, as an element of the due diligence process associated with the transaction. Frequently, a tenant must declare the existence of any outstanding disputes with the landlord at the time the attornment is executed and waives any dispute not declared at that time.|$|R

[4] That Mr. Hugh Littlepage {{does not}} feel or express himself too {{strongly}} {{on the state of}} things that has now existed among us for long, long years, the following case, but one that illustrates the melancholy truth among many, will show. At a time when the tenants of an extensive landlord, to whom tens of thousands were owing for rent, were openly resisting the law, and defeating every attempt <b>to</b> <b>distrain,</b> though two ordinary companies of even armed constables would have put them down, the sheriff entered the house of that very landlord, and levied on his furniture for debt.

50|$|Bracton {{considers}} this problem: A enfeoffs to B to hold {{by a certain}} service and that B enfeoffs to C to hold the whole {{or part of the}} tenement by a less service. The law permits A <b>to</b> <b>distrain</b> C for the service due from B, but this violated equity. Then as to substitutions, even when B has done homage to A, nevertheless B may give A a new tenant by enfeoffing C to hold of A, and C will then hold of A whether A is agreeable to it or not. Bracton does not even expressly allow A to object that C is his personal enemy, or too poor to do the service. Pollock and Maitland consider this remarkable since Bracton does allow that the lord cannot substitute for himself in the bond of homage a new lord who is the enemy of the tenant, or too needy to fulfill the duties of warranty.|$|R
40|$|This Paper {{is written}} against the {{background}} of the need to strengthen Nigeria’s tax laws for optimum contribution to public revenue and economic development in an era of widespread tax evasion and economic recession. The Paper has found among other things that defects and loopholes that exist in the Companies Income Tax Act (CITA) is the occasion for widespread tax evasion, the arbitrary and discriminatory application of the Act, and the political manipulation of the process. The result is that the Act is completely encumbered in achieving its objectives. To eliminate these encumbrances, the paper has recommended, among other things, the amendment of the law to place the wide discretionary powers of the president to impose on or exempt companies from taxation under the supervision and authority of the National Assembly and to place the powers of the Federal Board of Inland Revenue <b>to</b> <b>distrain</b> properties of defaulters {{under the jurisdiction of the}} courts...|$|R

His creditors turned to the Jesuit procurator in Paris to demand payment, but he refused responsibility for the debts of an independent mission - though he offered to negotiate for a settlement. The creditors went to the courts and received a favorable decision in 1760 obliging the Society to pay, and giving leave <b>to</b> <b>distrain</b> {{in the case of}} non-payment.

However, Niall and Domhnall, like their lord the Earl of Carrick, were drifting towards rebellion.

In Spring 1305, Edward decided in favour of Keith, judging [...] "to allow Keith to have these children and <b>to</b> <b>distrain</b> Sir Dovenald Chambel and Sir Nel Chambel by their lands and bodies".
