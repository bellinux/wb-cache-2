500|$|The play {{ran for a}} month (and was Coward's {{first play}} seen in America), after which Coward {{returned}} to acting in works by other writers, starring as Ralph in The Knight of the Burning Pestle in Birmingham and then London. He did not enjoy the role, finding Francis Beaumont and his sometime collaborator John Fletcher [...] "two of the dullest Elizabethan writers ever known... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very,</b> very long part, but I was very, very bad at it". Nevertheless, The Manchester Guardian thought that Coward got {{the best out of}} the role, and The Times called the play [...] "the jolliest thing in London".|$|E
500|$|Hepburn {{is one of}} {{the most}} celebrated American actresses, but she has also been criticized for a lack of versatility. Her {{on-screen}} persona closely matched her own real personality, something Hepburn admitted herself. In 1991 she told a journalist, [...] "I think I'm always the same. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> definite personality and I liked material that showed that personality." [...] Playwright and author David Macaray has said, [...] "Picture Katharine Hepburn in every movie she ever starred in and ask yourself if she's not playing, essentially, the same part over and over... Icon or no icon, let's not confuse a truly fascinating and unique woman with a superior actress." [...] Another repeated criticism is that her demeanor was too cold.|$|E

I worked up on another idea and brought {{together}} a featured band for her to see. I did it all in front of me. [...] In retrospect, it feels good, the video we have done much better suited to the track than the first ideas. [...] has an incredible track on everything she is doing. Style, music, business— she has a mental track of every single thing and won't give up until she is completely satisfied. And on music videos there is nothing she does {{with one hand on}} her back— she's engaged to one hundred percent.|$|E

500|$|Until now, Cardinale's {{own voice}} {{had not been}} used in her Italian films, as it was {{considered}} too hoarse, and owing to [...] her French accent, insufficiently Italian. Not until 8½ was she allowed to use her own voice. Cardinale explained: [...] "When I arrived for my first movie, I couldn't speak a word. I thought I was on the moon. I couldn't understand {{what they were talking}} about. And I was speaking in French; in fact I was dubbed. And Federico Fellini was the first one who used my voice. I think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> strange voice." [...] With her portrayal of Angelica in The Leopard and her brief appearance as herself in 8½, Cardinale achieved the definitive status of a top-ranking star.|$|E
500|$|In 1938, Leopoldo Torres Ríos gave Bence {{her first}} {{starring}} role in film in Adiós Buenos Aires, where she played a showgirl [...] "Luisita" [...] living a bohemian life. In November 1938, she {{attracted the attention of}} the public and press when she starred in the play Mujeres at the Smart Theatre, (currently Multiteatro) located on Avenida Corrientes. The play was written by American writer and actress Clare Boothe Luce and also starred Mecha Ortiz. In one of the scenes, Bence appeared bathing in a tub full of foam. She said: [...] "I wore nylon mesh, it was very modest but, as was logical, it did not go unnoticed. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> big impact {{as a result of that}} scene... so much so that, the Teatro Maipo... made a parody of it". [...] The work was described as [...] "original, fresh, and modern", reaching 250 performances. It was revived at the Teatro Fénix de Flores.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in just three weeks at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California. The album was co-produced by Lewis's boyfriend Johnathan Rice, former Beachwood Sparks and All Night Radio member Dave Scher, and Under the Blacklight producer Jason Lader. Lewis attempted to record {{as many of the}} songs live as possible. [...] "We did it in the studio for my 32nd birthday," [...] according to Lewis, [...] "and we had a great time, collaborating with a bunch of friends. It was definitely a lot less focused than Rabbit Fur Coat. With that record <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> specific vision, [...] but with this record it was really more about the vibe, the songs and the collaborations". A source quoted by Entertainment Weekly said that the album [...] "all sounds super natural, nice, and simple. Like it doesn't belong in any decade. It's just timeless." [...] The album was inspired by a variety of musical styles, including alternative country, Americana, indie rock, and soul.|$|E

500|$|Although {{there had}} been stress and {{conflict}} during the recording of other Chili Peppers albums, the Mother's Milk sessions were uncomfortable due to Beinhorn's incessant desire to create a hit. He recalled {{that he and the}} band were at odds: [...] "Suffice to say that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> intense personal relationship [...] and somewhere along the line I fell out with [...]" [...] Beinhorn constantly clashed with Frusciante over guitar effects. According to Kiedis, [...] " [...] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones." [...] Frusciante was frustrated with the producer's attitude and ultimately resented his playing on the record, feeling it was too [...] "macho". Kiedis recalled that, in the end, [...] "I couldn't tolerate his direction any longer. He was trying to squeeze something out of me that I wasn't feeling, and we got in a fight and I knew that I was done with him." ...|$|E
500|$|The box set's {{release was}} {{confirmed}} on Wainwright's official site on March 21, 2011. Only 3,000 copies were produced for worldwide distribution. Box sets were sold for £150 in the United Kingdom, €170 throughout Europe, and were available as imports in the United States for $350. As {{part of the}} marketing strategy to promote the collection and concert series, Universal Music Catalogue developed a [...] "treasure hunt" [...] video for YouTube where visitors identified clues, and navigated links within a collage of Wainwright's music videos. According to Wainwright, the rarities box set was a [...] "little Rufus blast" [...] before he began work on his next pop album. Wainwright also said the following of the collection: [...] "There's my old demos, {{a lot of them}} were recorded in Montreal... when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very,</b> very different voice, I kind of sounded like a little old man. There's that and there's a lot of fabulous collaborations with my mother, my father and some other great artists." [...] Wainwright had originally intended to call the box set The Rufus Cycle. After being told the title was [...] "too sophisticated", he went with House of Rufus, partly inspired by Lady Gaga's Haus of Gaga. Wainwright claimed the box set's release shortly after his father's (Loudon Wainwright III) box set 40 Odd Years was [...] "totally serendipitous".|$|E
2500|$|After {{having done}} acting for some years, Chang went into {{directing}} theatre. She made the career change because [...] "it {{was a chance}} to work on projects that resonate deeply and personally and highlighted my world [...] of coming from a divided China that was still in the throes of revolution but steeped in culture and history. As a director, I had more autonomy in choosing projects, and felt I was contributing to American theatre with stories drawn from China's vast literary legacy. I had been acting and dancing professionally for 10 years on and off-Broadway, so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good immersion into mainstream theatre. With directing, I can help shape what the audience experiences and walks away with." ...|$|E

2500|$|He was re-elected {{eight times}} from the Brooklyn and Queens-based district, which changed numbers twice in his tenure (it was {{numbered}} the 16th from 1981 to 1983, the 10th from 1983 to 1993 and the 9th from 1993). In 1982, {{as a result}} of redistricting, Schumer faced a potential matchup with veteran Brooklyn congressman Steve Solarz, although the matchup did not actually materialize. In preparation, Schumer [...] "set about making friends on Wall Street, tapping the city's top law firms and securities houses for campaign donations. 'I told them I looked like <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> difficult reapportionment fight. If I were to stand a chance of being re-elected, I needed some help,' he would later tell the Associated Press." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1930, Darger {{settled into}} a second-floor room on Chicago's North Side at 851 W. Webster Avenue in the Lincoln Park section of the city, near the DePaul University campus. It was in this room for the next 43 years that Darger would imagine and write his massive tomes (in {{addition}} to a 10-year daily weather journal and assorted diaries) {{until his death in}} April 1973 in St. Augustine's Catholic Mission home (the same institution in which his father had died). In the last entry in his diary, he wrote: [...] "January 1, 1971. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> poor nothing like Christmas. Never had a good Christmas all my life, nor a good new year, and now... I am very bitter but fortunately not revengeful, though I feel should be how I am..." ...|$|E
2500|$|I was {{not more}} than {{thirteen}} years old, when in my loneliness and destitution I longed for some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend. He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners {{in the sight of}} God: that they were by nature rebels against His government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ. I cannot say that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> distinct notion of what was required of me, but one thing I did know well: I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise.I consulted a good old colored man named Charles Lawson, and in tones of holy affection he told me to pray, and to [...] "cast all my care upon God." [...] This I sought to do; and though for weeks I was a poor, broken-hearted mourner, traveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden lightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever. I saw the world in a new light, and my great concern was to have everybody converted. My desire to learn increased, and especially, did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the Bible.|$|E

2500|$|Tendulkar's {{allegations}} {{were supported by}} former teammates such as Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and V. V. S. Laxman. Zaheer called Chappell a [...] "control freak" [...] and said, [...] "After he was appointed {{the coach of the}} Indian team, he once came upto me and told [...] "Zaheer, you will not be playing for India till I remain the coach". He also added that the two-year term under Chappell was [...] "easily the worst and darkest phase" [...] that he could remember. Harbhajan said, [...] "Chappell destroyed Indian cricket {{to such an extent that}} it required at least 3 years to again get back on track. The worst part was some players in that team, who sucked upto the coach and would supply selective misinformation creating bigger rifts". He also talked about the email leak, [...] "Sourav was batting out there in the middle and this man was typing a critical e-mail against Sourav, sitting right there in that dressing room. He had no interest in the proceedings of the match. There were seven guys that he wanted to get rid of. Sourav was his primary target followed by myself, Virender Sehwag, Ashish Nehra, Zaheer Khan and Yuvraj Singh". Laxman was also critical of Chappell in saying that Chappell took Indian cricket [...] "backwards" [...] during his coaching tenure. Laxman also recalled an incident from 2006, [...] "This happened in 2006 at the Wankhede Stadium when India played versus England. Yuvraj Singh was picked ahead of me. We were going to the West Indies for a four-Test series after that and he asked me if I would open. I mentioned in 2000 I had decided I would not open anymore after it didn't work for me in the first four years. I was consistent in the middle order since 2000. Chappell asked me my age and said - Don't you think 31 is too young an age to sit at home? I was astonished to hear this. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good run under him.
