5|$|A {{public meeting}} in February 1919 {{established}} a consensus {{to create a}} monument and a fund {{for the families of}} wounded servicemen. The meeting agreed to commission Lutyens to design the monument. <b>His</b> <b>design</b> for a bridge over the River Roch was abandoned after a local dignitary purchased a plot of land adjacent to Rochdale Town Hall and donated it for the site of the memorial. Lutyens revised <b>his</b> <b>design</b> and Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby, unveiled the memorial on 26 November 1922. It is a Grade I listed structure, having been upgraded in 2015 when Lutyens' war memorials were declared a national collection.|$|E
5|$|After McDougall {{was unable}} to persuade {{existing}} shipbuilders to try his designs, he founded the American Steel Barge Company in Superior, Wisconsin in 1888, and built them himself. McDougall actively promoted <b>his</b> <b>design</b> and company by sending the SS Charles W. Wetmore to London, and starting another shipyard in Everett, Washington, which built the SS City of Everett. When the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, {{to be held in}} Chicago, Illinois, was in the planning stages, McDougall recognized another opportunity to publicize <b>his</b> <b>design.</b> The Columbus, conceived as an elaborate ferry, was intended to demonstrate that the whaleback design would work well in passenger service, and would be able to travel at high speed. The ship's name honored the explorer Christopher Columbus as did the World's Columbian Exposition itself, timed to coincide with the 400th anniversary of his first voyage to the New World.|$|E

5|$|Bhunivelze's {{physical}} form for Lightning Returns {{was designed by}} Toshitaka Matsuda.

50|$|While {{employed}} at the railroad, Griggs filed several patents of <b>his</b> own <b>design</b> for items {{as varied as}} brake systems, driving wheels, and the firebrick arch. <b>His</b> <b>designs</b> were so successful that the B&P continued building locomotives to <b>his</b> <b>designs</b> {{for a few years}} after his death in 1870.|$|R

50|$|Blakely {{tried to}} {{interest}} the British government in <b>his</b> <b>designs</b> but without success. <b>His</b> <b>designs</b> involved a cast-iron core with wrought-iron or steel banding {{to reinforce the}} breech. The design {{is similar to that}} of the Armstrong guns of Sir William George Armstrong. Blakely believed that Armstrong had infringed upon his patents, so when Armstrong became superintendent of the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, Blakely stopped offering <b>his</b> <b>designs</b> to the British Army.|$|R
5|$|Dodd {{submitted}} a scheme for a bridge at Vauxhall of 13 arches. However, {{soon after the}} 1809 Act was passed, he was dismissed by the Vauxhall Bridge Company and <b>his</b> <b>design</b> was abandoned.

5|$|In 1872, {{architect}} Elijah E. Myers of Springfield, Illinois, {{was commissioned}} {{to design the}} new capitol building and the design committee selected <b>his</b> <b>design</b> named Tuebor, which means I will defend.

The cornerstone was laid on October 2, 1873, with about 7,000 Lansing residents and some 30,000 to 50,000 visitors attending. Construction and finishing work were completed by late 1878.

2500|$|Influenced by {{classical}} Greek {{and contemporary}} Modernist architecture, Langer developed a sophisticated hybrid of classical and modern <b>design</b> principles. With <b>his</b> civic <b>designs,</b> Langer explored {{the idea of}} the conjunction of landmark and landscape and <b>his</b> <b>designs</b> typically incorporated a harmonious setting for the architecture. Inspired by Queensland's flora, fauna and climate, <b>his</b> <b>designs</b> worked with the context in complementary ways and his work on climatic design in architecture has been called [...] "pioneering". Fundamental to <b>his</b> <b>designs,</b> he sited buildings and outdoor spaces for optimum orientation, ensured interiors had high levels of natural daylighting and ventilation, and incorporated gardens of Australian plants for the occupation and enjoyment of the users. <b>His</b> <b>designs</b> were typified by modern, highly functional spaces that were fit for purpose, yet, had a degree of flexibility of use. Langer set new standards for design in Queensland.|$|R

5|$|After de l'Orme died in 1570, Catherine {{abandoned}} <b>his</b> <b>design</b> for a freestanding {{house with}} courtyards.

Bullant attached columns to his pavilion, as advocated in his 1564 book on the classical orders, to mark proportion. Some commentators have interpreted his different approach as a criticism of de l'Orme's departures from the style of Roman monuments.|$|E
5|$|After {{the signing}} of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato on December 14, 1897, General Aguinaldo, after their {{voluntary}} exile, visited the Agoncillo residence in Hong Kong.
