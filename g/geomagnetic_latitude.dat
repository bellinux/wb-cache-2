The flux is dependent on <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>latitude,</b> with a maximum near the magnetic poles. At solar minimums, due to lower solar magnetic field shielding, the flux is about twice as high vs the solar maximum. It also dramatically increases during solar flares.

50|$|During World War II, {{magnetic}} pistols often exploded prematurely {{or not at}} all. The {{reason was}} that magnetic lines are more horizontal close to the equator than towards the poles. For example, the US Mark 6 magnetic pistol was designed and tested only once at 41° latitude (60° <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>latitude)</b> at Narragansett Bay, but was primarily used in equatorial latitudes. At the equator, the signal strength to the Mark 6 magnetic pistol was only about half that of where the Mark 6 was tested.

30|$|Earth’s {{ionosphere}} is {{the single}} largest contributor to the GNSS error budget and the phenomenon of scintillation in particular poses the most degrading effects. Scintillation is characterised by rapid fluctuations in the amplitude and phase of transionospheric radio signals as they pass through small-scale plasma density irregularities in the ionosphere (Kintner et al. 2001, and references therein). The occurrence of scintillation shows large day-to-day variability with local time, season, latitude, longitude, as well as solar and geomagnetic activity. The global morphology of ionospheric scintillation occurrence is well known (Basu et al. 2002; Liu et al. 2016) with occurrence peaks at auroral to polar latitudes (65 °– 90 ° <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>latitudes)</b> and the equatorial bands (extending from 20 °N to 20 °S <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>latitudes).</b> In these two regions, however, the processes governing the generation of irregularities causing scintillation are quite different, thereby leading to {{significant differences in the}} observed characteristics of the scintillation effects.|$|R

5000|$|During the Maunder Minimum aurorae {{had been}} {{observed}} seemingly normally, {{with a regular}} decadal-scale cycle. This is somewhat surprising because the later, and less deep, Dalton sunspot minimum is clearly seen in auroral occurrence frequency, at least at lower geomagnetic latitudes. [...] Because <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>latitude</b> {{is an important factor}} in auroral occurrence, (lower-latitude aurorae requiring higher levels of solar-terrestrial activity) it becomes important to allow for population migration and other factors that may have influenced the number of reliable auroral observers at a given magnetic latitude for the earlier dates. Decadal-scale cycles during the Maunder minimum can also be seen in the abundances of the beryllium-10 cosmogenic isotope (which unlike carbon-14 can be studied with annual resolution) [...] but these appear to be in antiphase with any remnant sunspot activity. An explanation in terms of solar cycles in loss of solar magnetic flux was proposed in 2012.|$|E
50|$|The Space Test Program {{spacecraft}} P78-1 or Solwind {{was launched}} on February 24, 1979 and continued operating until September 13, 1985, {{when it was}} shot down in orbit during an Air Force ASM-135 ASAT test. The platform was of the Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO) type, with a solar-oriented sail and a rotating wheel section. P78-1 was in a noon-midnight, Sun-synchronous orbit at 600 km altitude. The orbital inclination of 96° implied that a substantial fraction of the orbit was spent at high latitude, where the particle background prevented detector operation. In-flight experience showed that good data were obtained between 35° N and 35° S <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>latitude</b> outside the South Atlantic Anomaly. This yields an instrument duty cycle of 25-30%. Telemetry data were obtained for about 40-50% of the orbits, yielding a net data return of 10-15%. Though this data rate appears low, it means that about 108 seconds of good data reside in the XMON data base.|$|E

40|$|The {{response}} of the mid-latitude ionosphere to geomagnetic storms depends upon several pre-storm conditions, the dominant ones being season and local time of the storm commencement (SC). The difference between a site's geographic and <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>latitudes</b> is also of major importance since it governs the blend of processes linked to solar production and magnetospheric input, respectively. Case studies of specific storms using ionospheric data from both hemispheres are inherently dominated by seasonal effects and the various local times versus longitude of the SCs. To explore inter-hemispheric consistency of ionospheric storms, we identify "geophysically-equivalent-sites" as locations where the geographic and <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>latitudes</b> have the same relationship {{to each other in}} both hemispheres. At the longitudes of the dipole tilt, the differences between geographic and <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>latitudes</b> are at their extremes, and thus these are optimal locations to see if pre-conditioning and/or storm-time input are the same or differ between the hemispheres. In this study, we use ionosonde values of the F 2 -layer maximum electron density (NmF 2) to study geophysical equivalency at Wallops Island (VA) and Hobart (Tasmania), using statistical summaries of 206 events during solar cycle # 20. We form average patterns of ΔNmF 2 (%) versus local time over 7 -day storm periods that are constructed in ways that enhance the portrayal of the average characteristic features of the positive and negative phases of ionospheric storms. The results show a consistency between four local time characteristic patterns of storm-induced perturbations, and thus for the average magnitudes and time scales of the processes that cause them in each hemisphere. Subtle differences linked to small departures from pure geophysical equivalency point to a possible presence of hemispheric asymmetries governed by the non-mirror-image of geomagnetic morphology in each hemisphere...|$|R
30|$|Polar-orbit {{satellites}} at low altitudes {{provide a}} uniform spatial coverage of observations from both hemispheres, although they cannot yield a uniform time series {{at a fixed}} location. However, spacecraft recordings of sufficient length give a reliable average description, as shown by Juusola et al. (2009), who studied five years of CHAMP data to determine auroral ionospheric currents (altitude adjusted corrected <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>latitudes</b> 55 – 76.5 deg). They included about 20000 overflights across the northern auroral region and about 24000 in the south.|$|R
5000|$|The K-scale is quasi-logarithmic. The {{conversion}} table from maximum fluctuation R (in units of nanoteslas, nT) to K-index, varies from observatory to observatory {{in such a}} way that the historical rate of occurrence of certain levels of K are about the same at all observatories. In practice this means that observatories at higher <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>latitude</b> require higher levels of fluctuation for a given K-index. For example, at Godhavn, Greenland, a value of K = 9 is derived with R = 1500 nT, while in Honolulu, Hawaii, a fluctuation of only 300 nT is recorded as K = 9. In Kiel, Germany, K = 9 corresponds to R = 500 nT or greater. The real-time K-index is determined after the end of prescribed intervals of 3 hours each: 00:00-03:00, 03:00-06:00, ..., 21:00-24:00. The maximum positive and negative deviations during the 3 hour period are added together to determine the total maximum fluctuation. These maximum deviations may occur any time during the 3 hour period.|$|E
50|$|The excess {{relative}} to natural abundance of cosmogenic nuclides {{in a rock}} sample is usually measured by means of accelerator mass spectrometry. Cosmogenic nuclides such as these are produced by chains of spallation reactions. The production rate for a particular nuclide {{is a function of}} <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>latitude,</b> the amount of sky that {{can be seen from the}} point that is sampled, elevation, sample depth, and density of the material in which the sample is embedded. Decay rates are given by the decay constants of the nuclides. These equations can be combined to give the total concentration of cosmogenic radionuclides in a sample as a function of age.The two most frequently measured cosmogenic nuclides are beryllium-10 and aluminum-26. These nuclides are particularly useful to geologists because they are produced when cosmic rays strike oxygen-16 and silicon-28, respectively. The parent isotopes are the most abundant of these elements, and are common in crustal material, whereas the radioactive daughter nuclei are not commonly produced by other processes. As oxygen-16 is also common in the atmosphere, the contribution to the beryllium-10 concentration from material deposited rather than created in situ must be taken into account. 10Be and 26Al are produced when a portion of a quartz crystal (SiO2) is bombarded by a spallation product: oxygen of the quartz is transformed into 10Be and the silicon is transformed into 26Al. Each of these nuclides is produced at a different rate. Both can be used individually to date how long the material has been exposed at the surface. Because there are two radionuclides decaying, the ratio of concentrations of these two nuclides can be used without any other knowledge to determine an age at which the sample was buried past the production depth (typically 2-10 meters).|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} of these dating {{techniques}} is Cosmogenic radionuclide dating.Earth is constantly bombarded with primary cosmic rays, high energy charged particles [...] - [...] mostly protons and alpha particles. These particles interact with atoms in atmospheric gases, producing {{a cascade of}} secondary particles that may in turn interact and reduce their energies in many reactions as they pass through the atmosphere. By the time the cosmic ray cascade reaches the surface of Earth it is primarily composed of neutrons. When one of these particles strikes an atom it can dislodge one or more protons and/or neutrons from that atom, producing a different element or a different isotope of the original element. In rock and other materials of similar density, most of the cosmic ray flux is absorbed within the first meter of exposed material in reactions that produce new isotopes called cosmogenic nuclides. At Earth's surface most of these nuclides are produced by neutron spallation. Using certain cosmogenic radionuclides, scientists can date how long a particular surface has been exposed, how long a certain piece of material has been buried, or how quickly a location or drainage basin is eroding. The basic principle is that these radionuclides are produced at a known rate, and also decay at a known rate. Accordingly, by measuring the concentration of these cosmogenic nuclides in a rock sample, and accounting for the flux of the cosmic rays and the half-life of the nuclide, {{it is possible to}} estimate how long the sample has been exposed to the cosmic rays.The cumulative flux of cosmic rays at a particular location can be affected by several factors, including elevation, <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>latitude,</b> the varying intensity of the Earth's magnetic field, solar winds, and atmospheric shielding due to air pressure variations.Rates of nuclide production must be estimated in order to date a rock sample. These rates are usually estimated empirically by comparing the concentration of nuclides produced in samples whose ages have been dated by other means, such as radiocarbon dating, thermoluminescence, or optically stimulated luminescence.|$|E
30|$|In interhemispheric comparisons, it {{is crucial}} to use geomagnetically {{conjugate}} sites connected by the same field line. Conjugacy is typically determined with statistical models describing the average field topology in the near-space. As noted by Kozyreva et al. (2006), the concept of conjugacy makes sense only in a closed magnetosphere. In the polar caps that are projected on the geomagnetic field open lines, it is more logical to use the term symmetry, referring to the corresponding <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>latitudes</b> and longitudes calculated according to a selected field model.|$|R
