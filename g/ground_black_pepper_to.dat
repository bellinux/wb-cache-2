5000|$|Like most {{characters}} in Watchmen, Rorschach has no obvious [...] "superpowers". He merely has his strong will, peak-human physical strength, and finely-honed sense of timing and precision. Rorschach is very resourceful and creative, adapting ordinary household objects into tools or weapons, {{such as the}} use of a can of aerosol spray in combination with multiple matches to set fire to a police officer and throwing <b>ground</b> <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> <b>to</b> blind another police officer, during a confrontation at Moloch's house. During the series he is shown to use cooking fat, a toilet bowl, a cigarette, a fork and his jacket all as weapons; he is also shown using a coat hanger as a makeshift measuring device. He owns a gas-powered grappling gun, which he uses to climb buildings (and once as a makeshift harpoon gun against a police officer), as seen in Chapter One, which was designed and built by Nite Owl II.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a large}} {{variety of}} lecsós, the base of all being a mixture of {{tomatoes}} and peppers (both sweet and hot), onions, spiced with salt, some variants also sugar, {{a fair amount of}} red paprika powder and often garlic. Some recipes may also use bay leaf, <b>ground</b> <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> or thyme. <b>To</b> make the perfect lecsó base, one must render the lard from the smoked bacon (if that is used instead of oil, which is also common), and fry the onion slices until the edges become slightly brownish. Next the pepper slices must be added and fried until crisp. The tomatoes come last because, if added at the beginning, they would soak the onions and the peppers.|$|R

5000|$|Traditionally, chả lụa {{is made of}} lean pork, potato starch, garlic, <b>ground</b> <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> and nước mắm (fish sauce). The pork has to be pounded {{until it}} becomes pasty; it cannot be chopped or ground as the meat would still be fibrous, dry, and crumbly. Near {{the end of the}} {{pounding}} period, a few spoonfuls of nước mắm are added to the meat for flavour, but salt, <b>ground</b> <b>black</b> <b>pepper,</b> and sugar can also be added. The meat is now called giò sống, meaning “raw sausage”, and can be used in other dishes as well.|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science - Animal Sciences and IndustryJ. Scott SmithHeterocyclic amines (HCAs) are a {{class of}} {{mutagenic}} and carcinogenic chemical compounds formed {{on the outside of}} meat and fish when cooked at high temperatures. 2 -amino- 1 -methyl- 6 -phenylimidazo[4, 5 -b]pyridine (PhIP) is the most abundantly formed HCA. HCAs have been found to cause cancer in mice and rats; PhIP specifically has been found to cause breast, rectal, prostate, and colon cancers. Model systems are often used to replicate the HCA chemical reactions in meat products without causing the many side reactions when meat is cooked at high temperatures. Model systems are also a useful way to study the effects of different variables and compounds on the formation of HCAs without using meat. A model system using amounts of 0. 2 mmol glucose, 0. 4 mmol creatinine, and 0. 4 mmol phenylalanine in 10 : 90 water/diethylene glycol (v/v) was used to study the formation of PhIP. Differing levels of <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> oil, <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> extract, and rosemary extract (36, 71, 142, 285, 550 μL), synthetic antioxidants BHT and TBHQ (0. 05 mmol, 0. 1 mmol, 0. 2 mmol, 0. 4 mmol), and piperine (4. 02 mg, 8. 04 mg, 16. 14 mg, 31. 14 mg) were added to the model system to study their effect on PhIP formation. PhIP formation with added BHT (0. 2 and 0. 4 mmol) and TBHQ (0. 4 mmol) were not significantly different from the control. All other added compounds decreased PhIP formation significantly from the control at p < 0. 05. Solid phase micro extraction (SPME) headspace analysis was conducted on <b>ground</b> <b>black</b> <b>pepper,</b> <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> oil, and <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> extract <b>to</b> determine possible components responsible for PhIP inhibition. Six volatile compounds were found in common between <b>ground</b> <b>black</b> <b>pepper,</b> <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> oil, and <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> extract: 1 R-α-pinene, 3 -carene, caryophyllene, α-caryophyllene, cyclohexene, and D-limonene. D-limonene and caryophyllene had the largest peak areas, suggesting those compounds may play a part in PhIP inhibition in model systems...|$|R
