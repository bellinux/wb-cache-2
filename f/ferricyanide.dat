5|$|Osmium tetroxide {{has been}} used in {{fingerprint}} detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy. As a strong oxidant, it cross-links lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them. Because osmium atoms are extremely electron-dense, osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of biological materials. Those carbon materials have otherwise very weak TEM contrast (see image). Another osmium compound, osmium <b>ferricyanide</b> (OsFeCN), exhibits similar fixing and staining action.|$|E
5|$|The older {{writing was}} first noticed by Pierre Allix, a Protestant pastor. Jean Boivin, {{supervisor}} of the Royal Library, made the first extracts of various readings of the codex (under the notation of Paris 9) to Ludolph Küster, who published Mill's New Testament in 1710. In 1834–1835 potassium <b>ferricyanide</b> was used to bring out faded or eradicated ink, which {{had the effect of}} defacing the vellum from green and blue to black and brown.|$|E
25|$|Ammonia reacts violently {{with the}} halogens. Nitrogen triiodide, a primary high {{explosive}}, is formed when ammonia {{comes in contact}} with iodine. Ammonia causes the explosive polymerisation of ethylene oxide. It also forms explosive fulminating compounds with compounds of gold, silver, mercury, germanium or tellurium, and with stibine. Violent reactions have also been reported with acetaldehyde, hypochlorite solutions, potassium <b>ferricyanide</b> and peroxides.|$|E
500|$|Prussian blue, Fe43, is {{the most}} famous of the cyanide {{complexes}} of iron. [...] Its formation {{can be used as a}} simple wet chemistry test to distinguish between aqueous solutions of Fe2+ and Fe3+ as they react (respectively) with potassium <b>ferricyanide</b> and potassium ferrocyanide to form Prussian blue.|$|E
2500|$|Most glucometers today use an {{electrochemical}} method. Test strips {{contain a}} capillary that sucks up a reproducible amount of blood. The glucose {{in the blood}} reacts with an enzyme electrode containing glucose oxidase (or dehydrogenase). The enzyme is reoxidized with an excess of a mediator reagent, such as a <b>ferricyanide</b> ion, a ferrocene derivative or osmium bipyridyl complex. The mediator in turn is reoxidized by reaction at the electrode, which generates an electric current. [...] The total charge passing through the electrode {{is proportional to the}} amount of glucose in the blood that has reacted with the enzyme. The coulometric method is a technique where the total amount of charge generated by the glucose oxidation reaction is measured over a period of time. The amperometric method is used by some meters and measures the electric current generated at a specific point in time by the glucose reaction. This is analogous to throwing a ball and using the speed at which it is travelling at a point in time to estimate how hard it was thrown. The coulometric method can allow for variable test times, whereas the test time on [...] a meter using the amperometric method is always fixed. Both methods give an estimation of the concentration of glucose in the initial blood sample.|$|E

50|$|Except for {{polysulfide}} toners, sepia toning is done {{in three}} stages. First the print is soaked in a potassium <b>ferricyanide</b> bleach to re-convert the metallic silver to silver halide. The print is washed to remove excess potassium <b>ferricyanide,</b> and then immersed into a bath of toner, which converts the silver halides to silver sulfide.|$|E
50|$|The {{association}} of phosphorylation and {{the reduction of}} an electron acceptor such as <b>ferricyanide</b> increase similarly {{with the addition of}} phosphate, magnesium (Mg), and ADP. The existence of these three components is important for maximal reductive and phosphorylative activity. Similar increases in the rate of <b>ferricyanide</b> reduction can also be stimulated by a dilution technique. The dilution technique will not cause a further increase in the rate in which <b>ferricyanide</b> is reduced with the accumulation of ADP, phosphate, and Mg to a treated chloroplast suspension. ATP has been shown to inhibit the rate of <b>ferricyanide</b> reduction. By the studies of light intensities, it is concluded that the effect is largely on the light-independent steps of the Hill reaction. These observations are explained in terms of a proposed method in which phosphate esterfies during electron transport reactions, leading to the reduction of <b>ferricyanide,</b> and the rate of electron transport is limited by the rate of phosphorylation. If there is an increase in the rate of phosphorylation, then there will be an increase in the rate by which electrons are transported in the electron transport system.|$|E
50|$|Ferrocyanide and its {{oxidized}} product <b>ferricyanide</b> cannot freely {{pass through}} the plasma membrane.

50|$|Different {{blueprint}} processes {{based on}} photosensitive ferric compounds have been used. The best known {{is probably a}} process using ammonium ferric citrate and potassium <b>ferricyanide.</b> In this procedure a distinctly blue compound is formed and the process {{is also known as}} cyanotype. The paper is impregnated with a solution of ammonium ferric citrate and dried. When the paper is illuminated a photoreaction turns the trivalent (ferric) iron into divalent (ferrous) iron. The image is then developed using a solution of potassium <b>ferricyanide</b> forming insoluble ferroferricyanide (Turnbell's blue identical to Prussian blue) with the divalent iron. Excess ammonium ferric citrate and potassium <b>ferricyanide</b> are then washed away.|$|E

50|$|The {{compound}} has {{widespread use}} in blueprint drawing and in photography (Cyanotype process). Several photographic print toning processes involve {{the use of}} potassium <b>ferricyanide.</b> Potassium <b>ferricyanide</b> is used as an oxidizing agent to remove silver from negatives and positives, a process called dot etching. In color photography, potassium <b>ferricyanide</b> is used {{to reduce the size}} of color dots without reducing their number, as a kind of manual color correction. It is also used in black-and-white photography with sodium thiosulfate (hypo) to reduce the density of a negative or gelatin silver print where the mixture is known as Farmer's reducer; this can help offset problems from overexposure of the negative, or brighten the highlights in the print.|$|E

Potassium <b>ferricyanide</b> reacts with ferrous iron in acidic solution to produce the insoluble blue pigment, {{commonly referred to as}} Turnbull's blue or Prussian blue. To detect ferric (Fe3+) iron, potassium ferrocyanide is used instead in the Perls' Prussian blue staining method.
