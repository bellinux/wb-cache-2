40|$|Perinatal {{exposure}} to Dutch background dioxin levels is rather high. Studies of calamities {{have shown that}} dioxins negatively influence the respiratory system. It was hypothesized that perinatal {{exposure to}} background dioxin levels leads to lung suboptimality, probably through developmental interference. This study aimed to assess lung function in relation to perinatal dioxin exposure. Spirometry was performed in 41 healthy children (aged 7 - 12 y. mean 8. 2 y) with known perinatal dioxin exposure. The ratio of forced expiratory volume in I s to forced vital capacity (FEV 1 /FVC ratio) was determined. A complete medical history was taken.

The exposure scale of color reversal film is less than that of color negative film, and the procedure for exposure usually is different, favoring highlights rather than shadows; the shadow values then fall where they will.

40|$|Long-term dietary {{exposure}} to lead in children aged 1 up to 14 years living in 12 different European countries was estimated using daily food consumption patterns and mean lead concentrations in various food commodities. Food consumption data were all categorised according to a harmonised system to allow for linkage with lead concentration data in a standardised way. Two different models {{were used for the}} calculations: the beta-binomial-normal (BBN) model and the observed individual means (OIM) model. For both models the lower bound <b>exposure</b> <b>ranged</b> from 0. 4 to 1. 7 µg/kg bw per day for median consumers. For 99 th percentile consumers however the exposure differed between the two models with a lower bound <b>exposure</b> <b>ranging</b> from 0. 7 to 4. 1 µg/kg bw per day with the BBN model and 0. 9 to 7. 9 µg/kg bw per day with the OIM model. Upper bound exposures were on average a factor 1. 8 higher for both models. Exposures on a body weight basis were higher in younger compared to older children. To assess the long-term {{exposure to lead}} in European children, a model, such as the BBN model, that corrects for the within-person variation is the preferred method to be used. The OIM method results in an overestimation of the percentage of the population exceeding a provisional tolerable weekly intake which is of relevance for risk management decisions...|$|R
5000|$|A more {{technical}} approach recognises that a photographic film (or sensor) has a physically limited useful <b>exposure</b> <b>range,</b> sometimes called its dynamic range. If, for {{any part of}} the photograph, the actual exposure is outside this range, the film cannot record it accurately. In a very simple model, for example, out-of-range values would be recorded as [...] "black" [...] (underexposed) or [...] "white" [...] (overexposed) rather than the precisely graduated shades of colour and tone required to describe [...] "detail". Therefore, the purpose of exposure adjustment (and/or lighting adjustment) is to control the physical amount of light from the subject that is allowed to fall on the film, so that 'significant' areas of shadow and highlight detail do not exceed the film's useful <b>exposure</b> <b>range.</b> This ensures that no 'significant' information is lost during capture.|$|E

40|$|Overexposure to {{formaldehyde}} {{and related}} health complaints {{have long been}} associated with dissection of embalmed human cadavers. Previous studies have shown exposure levels exceeding current occupational health criteria and standards. However, published reports regarding proven effective control methods and technologies are limited. Given this shortage of information, various methods to control formaldehyde exposure at a medical school gross anatomy laboratory were evaluated through personal exposure measurements. Several interim controls were sequentially implemented, including increased dilution ventilation, general and local filtration with treated charcoal, and modified embalming methods. All {{were found to be}} inadequate. Special local exhaust work tables and a controlled supply air system were ultimately installed. Standard dissection tables were modified with slot exhausts on both sides, providing up to 1200 cfm exhaust per table. Air is supplied in a fairly laminar flow from above the tables. The system includes simple controls which reduce system energy consumption in unoccupied times and encourage system use. The laboratory accommodates 35 cadavers and is used by approximately 100 students and instructors. Personal samples collected before the final system installation, showed TWA formaldehyde <b>exposures</b> <b>ranging</b> from 0. 01 ppm to 4. 0 ppm, with an average of 1. 1 ± 0. 8 (n = 56).
