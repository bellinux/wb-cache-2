The Lord hath joined us together, and wo be to them that should part us. I said, I rather chuse to dye there with my friend, than to part from her. He was smitten, and went away, and came no more in five weeks... they did not part us till ten Weeks after: But oh the dark clouds and the sharp showers the Lord did carry us through! Death it self had been better than to have parted in that place.|$|E
500|$|There {{was this}} one time where I {{had to take a}} blind lady across the street and I’d never done that before. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> hand which is so {{obviously}} wrong! You don’t take a stranger’s hand! Like a 45-year-old woman! But once you take someone’s hand you can’t just let go because then you’re admitting your own awkwardness. I just held her hand {{and in the middle of}} the street she turns around and is like, ‘Do you mind if we don’t hold hands.’ ...|$|E
500|$|No {{lingering}} {{about was}} allowed, no gossiping {{with the other}} actors; the women’s dressing-rooms were {{on one side of}} the stage, the men's on the other, and when we were not actually playing we had to mount at once our respective narrow staircases– sheep rigorously separated from the goats! [...] Once, when my mother came to see me in London, expecting to find me dwelling in haunts of gilded luxury, and far down the road to perdition, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> behind the scenes and showed her the arrangements for the actors and actresses, conventual in their austerity. ... I think there never was a theatre run on lines of such strict propriety; no breath of scandal ever touched it in all the twenty years of my experience. [...] Gilbert would suffer no loose word or gesture either behind the stage or on it, and watched over us young women like a dragon.|$|E

500|$|DreamWorks {{announced}} Burton's {{appointment in}} August 2006, and Johnny Depp was cast as Todd. Christopher Lee, Peter Bowles, Anthony Head, {{and five other}} actors were set to play the ghost narrators, but their roles were cut (Head does appear in an uncredited cameo as a gentleman who congratulates Depp after the shaving contest). According to Lee, these deletions were due to time constraints caused by a break in filming during March 2007, while Depp's daughter recovered from an illness. Burton's domestic partner Helena Bonham Carter was cast in October 2006, as well as Sacha Baron Cohen. In December 2006, Alan Rickman was cast. In January 2007, Laura Michelle Kelly was cast as Lucy Barker. Timothy Spall {{was added to the}} cast, and said he was urged to audition by his daughter, who wanted him to work with Depp. He recalled, [...] "I really wanted this one – I knew Tim was directing and that Johnny Depp {{was going to be in}} it. My daughter, my youngest daughter, really wanted me to do it for that reason – Johnny Depp was in it. (She came on set to meet Depp) and he was really delightful to her, she had a great time. Then, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> to the junket – and (Depp) greeted her like an old pal when he saw her. I've got plenty of brownie points at the moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{has claimed}} to be the {{biological}} father of baby Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern. Following the death of the baby's half-brother Daniel Wayne Smith, Smith put his name on the disputed second birth certificate issued for the baby then known as Hanna Rose. Stern's sister, Bonnie, says Smith told her months before the birth that Birkhead could be the father. [...] "When I spoke to (Smith) in March, when she found out she was pregnant, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> shopping, and she told me the baby was due in mid-October, and that one other person could have been the father and that was Larry Birkhead, but nobody else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gray {{revealed}} {{the most memorable}} thing anyone has said about her work {{in an interview at}} The Eternal Night, a book review site in Britain. Says Gray, [...] "Well, a few years ago, I submitted a story to an editor who wrote back and said it was the sickest thing she ever read, but then she said it was [...] "sick in the best sense of the word". I may be warped, but knowing that the editor had seen a lot of bizarre stuff in her career, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> comment as a huge compliment, especially since the story was as psychological as it was gritty-physical. I went on to sell it elsewhere (twice!), and it received a Stoker recommendation, so I guess others thought it [...] "sick" [...] as well." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{incidents}} in the Genesis narrative demonstrate that adultery was understood to be a natural phenomenon. [...] These occur in the times of the Patriarchs over a span of about 200 years, the last one occurring more than 400 years before the giving of the law through Moses. In Genesis 12, Abram’s wife Sarai is taken into the Egyptian Pharaoh’s palace after Abram does not disclose her marital status. God inflicts “serious diseases on Pharaoh and his whole household.” Pharaoh realizes it is because Sarai is actually Abram’s wife and tells him, [...] "What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell {{me that she was}} your wife? Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to his {{acceptance}} speech for the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1998, Ron's interest in writing mathematics textbooks started the summer after his sophomore year in college. [...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told me that she had no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E
