40|$|Several {{technologies}} {{have been tested}} to reduce enteric methanogenesis, but very few have been successfully used in practical conditions for livestock. Furthermore, the consequences of reduced rumen methane production on animal performance and milk quality are poorly understood. The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} effect of feeding bromochloromethane (BCM), a <b>halogenated</b> <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> with potential antimethanogenic activity, to dairy goats on rumen methane production, fermentation pattern, the abundance of major microbial groups, and on animal performance and milk composition. Eighteen goats were allocated to 2 experimental groups of 9 animals each: treated (BCM+) or not (BCM?) with 0. 30 g of BCM/ 100 kg of body weight per day. The BCM was administered per os in 2 equal doses per day from parturition to 2 wk postweaning (10 wk). After weaning, methane emissions were recorded over 2 consecutive days (d 57 and 58 on treatment) in polycarbonate chambers. On d 59, individual rumen fluid samples were collected for volatile fatty acid (VFA) analysis and quantification of bacterial, protozoal, and archaeal numbers by real-time PCR. On d 69 and 70, daily milk production was recorded and samples were collected for determination of fat, protein, lactose, casein, and total solids concentration by infrared spectrophotometry, and fatty acid composition by gas chromatography. Treatment with BCM reduced methane production by 33 % (21. 6 vs. 14. 4 L/kg of DMI) compared with nontreated animals, although it did not affect the abundance of rumen bacteria, protozoa, and total methanogenic archaea. The observed improvement in the efficiency of digestive processes was accompanied by a 36 % increase in milk yield, probably due to the more propionic type of rumen fermentation and an increase in VFA production. The increase in milk yield was not accompanied by any changes in the concentrations or yields of fat, protein, or lactose. Despite the substantial decrease in methane production, only minor changes in milk fatty acid profile were observed, suggesting that ruminal biohydrogenation pathways were not affected. Compounds that influence terminal biochemical pathways for methane production deserve further development for future application in the dairy goat sector. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|An {{enzyme that}} {{is capable of}} hydrolytic {{conversion}} of <b>halogenated</b> <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> to their corresponding alcohols was purified from a 1, 6 -dichlorohexane-degrading bacterium. The dehalogenase was found to be a monomeric protein of relative molecular mass 28000. The affinity for its substrates was relatively low with Km values for short-chain haloalkanes in the range 0. 1 - 0. 9 mM. The aliphatic dehalogenase showed a much broader substrate range than has been reported for halidohydrolases so far. Novel classes of substrates include dihalomethanes, C 5 -C 9 1 -halo-n-alkanes, secondary alkylhalides, halogenated alcohols and chlorinated ethers. Several of these compounds are important environmental pollutants, e. g. methylbromide, dibromomethane, 1, 2 -dibromoethane, 1, 3 -dichloropropene, and bis(2 -chloroethyl) ether. The degradation of chiral 2 -bromoalkanes appeared to proceed without stereochemical preference.

40|$|Plants are {{increasingly}} being employed to clean up environmental pollutants such as heavy metals; however, a major limitation of phytoremediation is the inability of plants to mineralize most organic pollutants. A key component of organic pollutants is <b>halogenated</b> <b>aliphatic</b> compounds that include 1, 2 -dichloroethane (1, 2 -DCA). Although plants lack the enzymatic activity required to metabolize this compound, two bacterial enzymes, haloalkane dehalogenase (DhlA) and haloacid dehalogenase (DhlB) from the bacterium Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ 10, {{have the ability to}} dehalogenate a range of <b>halogenated</b> <b>aliphatics,</b> including 1, 2 -DCA. We have engineered the dhlA and dhlB genes into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum ‘Xanthi’) plants and used 1, 2 -DCA as a model substrate to demonstrate the ability of the transgenic tobacco to remediate a range of <b>halogenated,</b> <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> DhlA converts 1, 2 -DCA to 2 -chloroethanol, which is then metabolized to the phytotoxic 2 -chloroacetaldehyde, then chloroacetic acid, by endogenous plant alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities, respectively. Chloroacetic acid is dehalogenated by DhlB to produce the glyoxylate cycle intermediate glycolate. Plants expressing only DhlA produced phytotoxic levels of chlorinated intermediates and died, while plants expressing DhlA together with DhlB thrived at levels of 1, 2 -DCA that were toxic to DhlA-expressing plants.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of obtaining microbial cultures for {{the degradation of}} <b>halogenated</b> <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> is mainly determined by the diversity and activity of catabolic enzymes that exist in nature. If a suitable organism is available, applications {{for the treatment of}} different waste streams can be developed. The relation between the kinetic parameters of the key enzymes and the properties of the organisms relevant for such applications is discussed, both for growth supporting and cometabolic degradation. When growth on a chlorinated aliphatic compound is possible, development of a biological remediation process is likely to be relatively easy. This is illustrated with the degradation of 1, 2 -dichloroethane, a synthetic compound that can be mineralized by specific cultures. Closely related compounds may be recalcitrant, which can be understood from an examination of the degradative pathways. The development of biological treatment processes based on cometabolic degradation is more demanding because selection of the proper organisms and maintaining them in the process are not straightforward. The range of compounds that can be degraded cometabolically is significantly larger. The potential of obtaining improved degradation by genetic adaptation and the use of biofilms is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Among one of {{the first}} {{particles}} removed from the aerogel collector from the Stardust sample return mission was an approx. 5 micron sized iron sulfide. The majority of the spectra from 5 different sections of this particle suggests the presence of aliphatic compounds. Due to the heat of capture in the aerogel we initially assumed these aliphatic compounds were not cometary but after comparing these results to a heated iron sulfide interplanetary dust particle (IDP) we believe our initial interpretation of these spectra was not correct. It has been suggested that ice coating on iron sulfides leads to aqueous alteration in IDP clusters which can then lead to the formation of complex organic compounds from unprocessed organics in the IDPs similar to unprocessed organics found in comets [1]. Iron sulfides have been demonstrated to not only transform <b>halogenated</b> <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> but also enhance the bonding of rubber to steel [2, 3]. Bromfield and Coville (1997) demonstrated using Xray photoelectron spectroscopy that "the surface enhancement of segregated sulfur to the surface of sulfided precipitated iron catalysts facilitates the formation of a low-dimensional structure of extraordinary properties" [4].

40|$|Dry {{cleaning}} facilities using tetrachloroethene, {{also known}} as perchloroethylene (PCE) produce a solid waste consisting of spent filtering powder, mainly calcined diatomaceous earth, benthonites or other absorbent materials. These powders are normally used during dry washing for the organic solvent filtration and discoloration prior to its recovery by distillation and condensation with refrigerating fluid. Therefore spent filtering powder contains high concentrations of PCE, together with dyes and non-volatile residues. PCE is a compound belonging to the class of <b>halogenated</b> <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> suspected of being carcinogenic and mutagenic to humans. For this reason spent filtering powders from dry cleaning are considered as hazardous waste, whose disposal in landfill is not allowed and for whom incineration represents the only viable alternative.

The objectives of this research were the characterization of a solid waste from dry cleaning activities, the evaluation of the organic solvent removal and recovery by means of different heat treatments with the aim of a reduction of the harmfulness of this waste for a possible landfill disposal as an alternative to combustion.

A previous study of chick embryos demonstrated that when injected into the air sacs of fertilized eggs trichloroethylene produced {{more than three times}} the number of cardiac defects that are found in control embryos. This mammalian study demonstrates similar effects of trichloroethylene and dichloroethylene when applied under provocative circumstances (that is, solutions delivered through a catheter into the gravid uterus from an intraperitoneal osmotic pump) to the developing rat fetus in utero during the period of organ differentiation and development. Furthermore, the effect is dose dependent for both agents. Although only a very small number of congenital heart anomalies (3 %) were found in the control group, 9 % and 12. 5 % were found in the lower dose trichloroethylene and dichioroethylene groups and 14 % and 21 % in the higher dose groups, respectively (p < 0. 05). A variety of cardiac defects were found. Dichloroethylene appears to be at least as great a cardiac teratogen as trichloroethylene even though it was administered at a 10 -fold lower concentration. These agents appear to be specific cardiac teratogens because only a single noncardiac anomaly was found.

40|$|Wetland systems {{provide both}} {{anaerobic}} (reducing) and aerobic (oxidizing) zones for the biodegradation of chlorinated <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (CAH). In particular, wetland plant roots provide micro-oxidizing environments for methanotrophic bacteria from {{the presence of}} methane, which is produced in anaerobic zones, and oxygen, which is brought to the subsurface by roots of wetland plants; this shows the potential for cometabolic degradation of common organic pollutants. This study explored the natural attenuation of CAHs by methanotrophic bacteria naturally associated with roots of the common wetland plant, Carex comosa. Root microcosms were amended with varying concentrations of methane; trichloroethene; cis 1, 2 -dichloroethene; 1, 2 -dichloroethane; or dichloromethane. Transformation Yield (Ty) increased with increasing CAH concentration. Ty and pseudo first-order degradation rate constants were often at least one order of magnitude lower than published values. A suite of <b>halogenated</b> <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (HAH) were studied in bench scale root microcosms for their potential to be cometabolically degraded by methanotrophic bacteria naturally associated with the roots of Carex comosa. Among the HAHs investigated, 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane, 1, 2 -dichloropropane, and 1, 3 -dichloropropene did not cometabolically degrade in the aerobic microcosm systems. However, four trihalomethanes (chloroform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, and bromoform) as well as 1, 1 -dichloroethene; 1, 2 -dichloroethane, and 1, 2 -dibromoethane were found to cometabolically degrade in the systems. Ty as well as pseudo first-order degradation rate constants normalized to biomass (k 1 -CAH) were calculated for compounds that did degrade. Past studies have explored the possibility of plant-microbe interactions for the bioremediation of harmful pollutants in soil. In this study, numerous chlorinated <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> were examined for their potential to cometabolically degrade by aerobic bacteria naturally associated with Carex comosa. The bacteria present along with the roots were able to degrade trichloroethene and cis 1, 2 -dichloroethene as well as low amounts of 1, 1 -dichloroethene; trans 1, 2 -dichloroethene; and 1, 2 -dichloroethane {{without the need for}} added growth substrate or an incubation period. Carbon tetrachloride and chloroform did not degrade in the systems. Ty was determined for compounds that did degrade but were often one to two orders of magnitude lower than published values. The growth substrate naturally present in the microcosm systems was unclear. Immediate degradation of chlorinated ethenes and removal of low levels of other types of CAHs indicates that cometabolic microorganisms are naturally present in and around the roots of wetland plants-even if the wetland system has not been previously exposed to chemical pollutants. Results of this study help to fill in key data for cometabolism of emerging pollutants by methanotrophic bacteria naturally associated with wetland plant roots. Results provide support for the use of wetland systems as means of natural attenuation of contaminated groundwater and provide more realistic degradation rate constants for natural attenuation...|$|R

40|$|Bench-scale microcosms with wetland plant roots were {{investigated}} {{to characterize the}} microbial contributions to contaminant degradation of <b>halogenated</b> <b>aliphatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (HAHs) with ammonium. The batch system microcosms consisted of a known mass of wetland plant roots in aerobic growth media where the roots provided both an inoculum of root-associated ammonium-oxidizing microorganisms and a microbial habitat. Aqueous growth media, ammonium, and HAHs including trichloroethene (TCE), cis- 1, 2 -dichloroethene (cis-DCE), chloroform (CF), 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane (1, 1, 2 -TCA), ethylene dibromide (EDB, or 1, 2 -dibromoethane, 1, 2 -DBA) and 1, 2 -dichloroethane (1, 2 -DCA) were replaced weekly in batch microcosms while retaining roots and root-associated biomass. Molecular biology results indicated that ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were enriched from wetland plant roots while analysis of contaminant and oxygen concentrations showed that those microorganisms can degrade HAHs by aerobic cometabolism. Cometabolism of TCE, at 29 and 46 µg/L, was sustainable {{over the course of}} 9 weeks, with 20 - 30 mg/L ammonium-N. However, at 69 µg/L of TCE, ammonium oxidation and TCE cometabolism were completely deactivated in two weeks. This indicated that between 46 and 69 µg/L TCE with 30 mg/L ammonium-N there is a threshold [TCE] below which sustainable cometabolism can be maintained with ammonium as the primary substrate. However, cometabolism-induced microbial deactivation of ammonium oxidation and TCE degradation at 69 µg/L TCE did not result in a lower abundance of the amoA gene in the microcosms. In the following experiments with TCE and elevated concentration of 75 mg/L ammonium-N, the deactivation of cometabolism with TCE was observed again when TCE reached from ~ 50 to ~ 70 µg/L. The cometabolic system was activated again one week after the system was replaced by a TCE-free medium culture. Rate constants did not change significantly during the inactivation cycle if normalized by X. It can be inferred that the drop in ammonium and TCE degradation at certain [TCE] are due to the activity shut down by ammonia oxidizers. Similar deactivation trends were observed in microcosm amended with cis-DCE, 1, 1, 2 -TCA and EDB when HAHs concentration increased above ~ 150 µg/L. No deactivation was observed in the reactors with CF and 1, 2 -DCA. A shift of ammonium oxidation production from nitrite of nitrate after HAHs were added was observed in all the HAHs batch systems and those shifts all coincided with a moderate decrease in ammonium and HAHs degradation kinetics. Following sequencing analysis on a cometabolic system with TCE showed that the relative abundance of nitrite oxidizers (especially Nitrospira) changed significantly after 14 weeks, which suggest that the microbial community changed with the addition of elevated concentration of TCE. The relative abundance of previous dominance genera Nitrosomonas decreased at higher TCE concentrations while the abundance of nitrite oxidizers Nitrospira increased significantly due to the weakened competence for oxygen from Nitrosomonas. This research indicates that microorganisms associated with wetland plant roots can assist in the natural attenuation of HAHs in contaminated aquatic environments, such as urban or treatment wetlands, and wetlands impacted by industrial solvents...|$|R

For monohalogenated ethanes, acetaldehyde was the major organic product and little or none of any of the alternate predicted products (2 -halogenated alcohols) were detected.

In addition, the amount of substrate required for the highest rate of haloethane oxidation increased with decreasing halogen molecular weight. For the n-chlorinated alkanes, the rate of dechlorination, as measured by the appearance of the corresponding aldehyde product, was greatest for chloroethane and decreased dramatically for chloropropane and chlorobutane (118, 4, and 8 nmol of aldehyde formed per min per mg of protein, respectively).
