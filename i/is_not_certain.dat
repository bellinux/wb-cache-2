5|$|By the 12th century, Islam was the {{dominant}} {{religion in the}} Middle East. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>certain,</b> however, {{if it was the}} religion of the majority outside the Arabian Peninsula. Arabic was the language of high culture and of the urban population, although other languages dating to pre-Islamic rule were still being used to a certain extent. Most Egyptians were speaking Arabic by the time the Ayyubids took power there.|$|E

5|$|Coutances {{started his}} career as a clerk to King Henry II of England in the royal chamber. He {{probably}} owed the position to his brother, who was already in royal service. Coutances may have been associated with the Beaumont family faction at court before beginning work for the king, but this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>certain.</b>|$|E
5|$|De Coventre {{received}} a B. A. under John de Waltirstone from the University of Paris by Lent, 1333. Although he had probably completed a Licentiate in the Arts and a Master of Arts by 1335, because of {{gaps in the}} Paris records it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>certain</b> {{that he was a}} Master until April 1345.|$|E
5|$|Despite the hectic {{schedule}} {{during this}} short visit, Wolfgang still {{found time to}} write his Symphony in F, K.112 (No.13). He contrived a further symphony from the Ascanio overture, by adding a finale to the two existing movements. Another symphony, K.96/111b, in C major, is sometimes allocated to this visit to Milan, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>certain</b> when (or indeed whether) Wolfgang actually wrote it.|$|E

It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>certain</b> what {{happened}} next, but an insertion in the Chronicle of Melrose states that Donald forced his three nephews into exile, {{although he was}} allied with another of his nephews, Edmund. John of Fordun wrote, centuries later, that an escort into England was arranged for them by their maternal uncle Edgar Ætheling.|$|E
5|$|Even {{once the}} mysteries were established, {{they were not}} {{performed}} everywhere Isis's cult was present. The only known sites for her mystery cult were in Italy, Greece, and Anatolia, although she was worshipped in nearly every province of the Roman Empire. In Egypt itself, only a few texts and images from the Roman period refer to the mysteries of Isis, and it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>certain</b> that they were ever performed there.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>certain</b> what {{significance}} {{the classic}} Maya {{gave to the}} 13th b'ak'tun.

5|$|The surname Golding {{is synonymous}} {{with a variety of}} hop known as Goldings and, {{although}} it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>certain</b> who discovered the hop, it has been accredited to John Golding (who died some time before 1811), the great nephew of Thomas and the owner of Ditton Court, or to his son John (who died at Ditton Place in 1851).|$|E
5|$|While {{the period}} when the name Cabernet Sauvignon became more {{prevalent}} over Petite Vidure <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>certain,</b> records indicate that the grape was a popular Bordeaux planting in the 18th century Médoc region. The first estates known to have actively grown the variety (and the likely source of Cabernet vines for other estates) were Château Mouton and Château d'Armailhac in Pauillac.|$|E
5|$|A map of Kintzheim in Alsace from 1348 {{contains}} the text zu dem Russelinge, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>certain</b> that this reference {{is to the}} grape variety. However, in 1477, Riesling was documented in Alsace under the spelling Rissling. In Wachau in Austria, {{there is a small}} stream and a small vineyard both called Ritzling, which are claimed locally to have given Riesling its name. However, {{there seems to be no}} documentary evidence to back this up, so this claim is not widely believed to be correct.|$|E

5|$|Dinheirosaurus is not {{extremely}} well known, {{and as a}} consequence, its phylogenetic position <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>certain.</b> In 2012 during a redescription of the taxon by Philip Mannion et al., it was recovered, in both cladograms, to be sister species to Supersaurus vivianae and together forming the most basal diplodocines. A 2012 cladogram, published by Mannion et al. and using a modified matrix of Whitlock (2011) found that Dinheirosaurus was more primitive than Torneria and more derived than Apatosaurus. However, a cladogram from 2014 found that their group was supported, but in fact more primitive than Apatosaurus, and therefore outside Diplodocinae.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the ship's light {{anti-aircraft}} armament was augmented several times. Improved 2cm C/38 guns {{replaced the}} original C/30 guns and three additional guns were added sometime in 1941. The two {{guns on the}} aft shelter deck were replaced by a single 2cm quadruple Flakvierling mount, probably sometime during 1942. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>certain</b> if the improved 3.7cm SK M/42 gun replaced her original 3.7cm guns, but Theodor Riedel had one quadruple, two twin and six single mounts for 2cm guns {{by the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|For hand weapons, most Roman foot {{carried a}} thrusting-spear (hasta) and a sword (spatha). Among the Alamanni, spears were the {{universal}} weapon, swords were probably less common. Nobles (optimates) {{and the professional}} warrior-retainers of ringgivers certainly had them. For the lower ranks the position <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>certain.</b> Ammianus' report on the battle implies that many in the Alamanni ranks carried swords. Those that did not were armed with a seax (long pointed Germanic knives with some types being shortswords) {{as well as a}} spear and/or battle axe.|$|E
