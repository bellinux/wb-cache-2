40|$|Abstract This paper shows {{a concept}} for parallelization of double <b>Divide</b> <b>and</b> Conquer and its {{preliminary}} result. For singular value decomposition, double <b>Divide</b> <b>and</b> Conquer was recently proposed. It first computes singular values by a compact version of <b>Divide</b> <b>and</b> Conquer. The corresponding singular vectors are then computed by twisted factorization. The speed {{and accuracy of}} double <b>Divide</b> <b>and</b> Conquer are as well or even better than standard algorithms such as QR <b>and</b> <b>Divide</b> <b>and</b> Conquer. In addition, {{it is expected that}} double <b>Divide</b> <b>and</b> Conquer has great parallelism because each step is theoretically parallel and heavy communication is no required. However, any parallel model of double <b>Divide</b> <b>and</b> Conquer has not been studied yet. In this paper, policy of the parallelization is discussed. Then, a parallel implementation with MPI is tested on a distributed memory parallel computer. It successfully shows a high parallelism...|$|R

5|$|Germany {{had been}} de facto <b>divided,</b> <b>and</b> two {{independent}} states, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic were created within {{the borders of}} Allied and Soviet occupation zones, accordingly. The rest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet spheres of influence. Most eastern and central European countries fell into the Soviet sphere, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities. As a result, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Albania became Soviet satellite states. Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy, causing tension with the USSR.|$|E

Some of the finest Baroque villas and palazzi, including the Palermo palace of the Prince of Lampedusa, are still in ruins following the United States bombing raids of 1943. In many cases, no attempt has been made to restore or even secure them. Those that survived the raids in good repair are often sub-divided into offices or apartments, their Baroque interiors dismantled, <b>divided,</b> <b>and</b> sold.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The parity based <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> conquer {{recursion}} {{trees are}} introduced where {{the sizes of}} the tree do not grow monotonically as n grows. These non-monotonic recursive functions called fogk(n) and ˜fogk(n) are strictly less than linear, o(n) but greater than logarithm, Ω(log n). Properties of fogk(n) such as non-monotonicity, upper and lower bounds, etc. are examined and proven. These functions are useful to analyze computational complexities of certain algorithms, especially problems of finding various properties of k-ary <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> conquer trees or size balanced k-ary trees. Several integer sequences based on the <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> conquer recursive relations are newly discovered as well.

30|$|To {{solve the}} state {{transition}} {{problem in a}} more efficient manner, we use the <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> conquer method [25] in this paper. In computer science, <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> conquer is an important algorithm design paradigm based on multi-branched recursion. The <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related types, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to solve the original problem.|$|R

It changed leaders five times {{in less than two}} months, and in the 2002 general election decreased its share of the vote to 10.2%, almost two-thirds less than its previous share. Most of its voters sided with the ÖVP, which became the largest party in Austria with 43% of the vote. Nevertheless, the coalition government of the ÖVP and FPÖ was revived after the election; however, there was increasing criticism within the FPÖ against the party's mission of winning elections at any cost.|$|E

5|$|Isopogon anethifolius, {{commonly}} known as narrowleaf- or narrow-leafed drumsticks, is a shrub in the family Proteaceae. The species is found only in coastal areas near Sydney, Australia, and to the immediate west. It occurs naturally in woodland, open forest and heathland on sandstone soils. An upright shrub, it can reach to 3m (10ft) in height, with terete leaves that are <b>divided</b> <b>and</b> narrow. The yellow flowers appear from September to December and are prominently displayed. They are followed by round grey cones, which give the plant its common name of drumsticks. The small hairy seeds {{are found in the}} old flower parts.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on digital <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> e-readiness in different fields {{with an eye to}} identifying trends and gaps in prominent research areas. In this study, 411 articles, conference papers, master's and doctoral dissertations, textbooks, and working papers on digital <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> e-readiness are classified and elaborated and their results are presented. Drawing upon this literature review and analysis of digital <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> e-readiness, several important research areas surrounding digital <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> e-readiness are discussed and examined from a critical standpoint. In the paper, a comprehensive list of references is presented and, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the most complete study of digital <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> e-readiness, even in the field of IT, in terms of its references. This paper reviews {{the literature on}} the digital <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> e-readiness from three perspectives with the purpose of identifying trends and gaps in this field: definition, methodology and scale. This review reveals that most modelers do not take sound theoretical and policy concerns into consideration, rather they tend to provide an empirical summarized measure for digitalization. Also, they develop digital <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> e-readiness models by building static composite indexes from individual indicators and tend to apply dynamic models to a lesser degree. Finally, {{there is a lack of}} research in the micro level vis-à-vis macro level that the authors attempt to compensate for. © 2013, IGI Global. All rights reserved...|$|R

The Korean War broke out only days after the primaries, and both Nixon and Douglas contended that the other had often voted with Marcantonio {{to the detriment of}} national security. Nixon's attacks were far more effective, and he won the November 7 general election by almost 20percentage points, carrying 53 of California's 58counties and all metropolitan areas.|$|E

5|$|This superficially {{impressive}} list {{of units}} overstates the actual {{capability of the}} armed forces at the time. Apart from privileged formations such as the Presidential Division and the 31st Airborne Brigade, most units were poorly trained, <b>divided</b> <b>and</b> so badly paid that they regularly resorted to looting. What operational abilities the armed forces had were gradually destroyed by politicisation of the forces, tribalisation, and division of the forces, included purges of suspectedly disloyal groups, intended to allow Mobutu to divide and rule. All this occurred against the background of increasing deterioration of state structures under the kleptocratic Mobutu regime.|$|E

The Jurchen, a subject tribe of the Liao, rebelled against them and formed their own state, the Jin dynasty (1115–1234). The Song official Tong Guan (1054–1126) advised Emperor Huizong (1100–1125) to form an alliance with the Jurchens, and the joint military campaign under this Alliance Conducted at Sea toppled and completely conquered the Liao dynasty by 1125.|$|E

Having captured Antananarivo by 1793 and transferred his capital from Ambohimanga to Antananarivo the following year, Andrianampoinimerina established new structures on the Rova grounds that would become imbued with the political and historic significance of his reign. In keeping with the tradition of Merina sovereigns before him, each building was assigned a name by which it could be distinguished. Several of the buildings were used interchangeably by the king as personal residences, including Manjakamiadana ("Where It is Pleasant to Rule"), Besakana, Manatsaralehibe ("Vast Improvement", also called Manatsara)—which he alone was authorised to enter—and Marivolanitra ("Beneath the Heavens"), a building reportedly designed with a staircase leading to a rooftop observation deck from which the king could observe the town and plains below.|$|E
