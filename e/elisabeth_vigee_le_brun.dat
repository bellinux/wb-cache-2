Around the same time, Jeanne de Valois-Saint-Rémy escaped from prison and fled to London, where she published damaging slander concerning her supposed amorous affair with the queen.|$|E

Madame Vigée Le Brun vividly describes the empress in her memoirs: [...] "the sight of this famous woman so impressed me that I {{found it impossible to}} think of anything: I could only stare at her. Firstly I was very surprised at her small stature; I had imagined her to be very tall, as great as her fame. She was also very fat, but her face was still beautiful, and she wore her white hair up, framing it perfectly. Her genius seemed to rest on her forehead, which was both high and wide. Her eyes were soft and sensitive, her nose quite Greek, her colour high and her features expressive. She addressed me immediately in a voice full of sweetness, if a little throaty: [...] "I am delighted to welcome you here, Madame, your reputation runs before you. I am very fond of the arts, especially painting. I am no connoisseur, but I am a great art lover." ...|$|E

This allowed further purchases of land in St. Petersburg, including the Krestovsky island as well as further additions to the Belosselsky Belozersky palace.|$|R
40|$|<b>Elisabeth</b> Louise <b>Vigee</b> <b>Le</b> <b>Brun</b> may be {{considered}} one of the most celebrated women artists of eighteenth century France. The elegance of her style and her ability to produce idealized images of her noble sitters made her increasingly popular within royalist circles. She was particularly favoured by the Queen Marie Antoinette whom she painted in a manner that provoked controversy among the critics and the public. <b>Vigee</b> <b>Le</b> Brun’s approach to her royal subject was very sentimental as it can be seen from her statements in her autobiography, the “Memoirs”. After the outbreak of the Revolution, <b>Vigee</b> <b>Le</b> <b>Brun</b> fled to Italy where she continued to paint portraits in the line of the Baroque rather than the Rococo tradition. Her reputation may be seen within the context of the influential role of the salon society of eighteenth century France. This society included women writers, painters and famous patrons of the arts. Their liberal behavior has become the topic of an extensive survey by contemporary feminist writers...|$|R

50|$|<b>Vigée</b> <b>Le</b> <b>Brun,</b> as {{her career}} blossomed, {{was invited to}} the Palace of Versailles granted {{patronage}} by Marie Antoinette. So pleased was the queen that {{during a period of}} six years, <b>Vigée</b> <b>Le</b> <b>Brun</b> would paint more than thirty portraits of the queen and her family, leading to her being commonly viewed as the official portraitist of Marie Antoinette. <b>Vigée</b> <b>Le</b> <b>Brun</b> helped to improve Marie Antoinette's image by painting portraits that included her children and worked towards making her more relatable to the public, in hopes to counter the bad press and judgement the queen had recently received. She received commission for the portrait Marie-Antoinette and her Children (1787) in 1785, which portrayed Marie Antoinette as a devout and loving mother figure.|$|R
50|$|Her artistic {{style is}} {{generally}} {{considered part of the}} aftermath of Rococo, while she often adopts a neoclassical style. <b>Vigée</b> <b>Le</b> <b>Brun</b> cannot be considered a pure Rococo or Neoclassical painter. Her subject matter and color palette can be classified as Rococo, however, her style is aligned with the emergence of Neoclassicism. <b>Vigée</b> <b>Le</b> <b>Brun</b> created a name for herself in Ancien Régime society by serving as the portrait painter to Marie Antoinette.|$|R
50|$|While in Saint Petersburg, <b>Vigée</b> <b>Le</b> <b>Brun</b> {{was made}} {{a member of the}} Academy of Fine Arts of Saint Petersburg. Much to <b>Vigée</b> <b>Le</b> Brun's dismay, her {{daughter}} Julie married a Russian nobleman.|$|R

50|$|Since <b>Vigée</b> <b>Le</b> <b>Brun</b> {{was close}} to the royal family, she was in danger during the French Revolution. In 1789, after the arrest of the royal family during the French Revolution, <b>Vigée</b> <b>Le</b> <b>Brun</b> fled France with her young {{daughter}} Julie. She lived and worked for some years in Italy (1789-92), Austria (1792-95), and Russia (1795-1801), where her experience in dealing with an aristocratic clientele was still useful. In Rome, her paintings met with great critical acclaim and she was elected to the Roman Accademia di San Luca.|$|R

50|$|In Russia, {{where she}} stayed from 1795 until 1801, she was {{received}} by the nobility and painted numerous aristocrats, including the last king of Poland Stanisław August Poniatowski {{and members of the}} family of Catherine the Great. Although the French aesthetic was widely admired in Russia, there remained various cultural differences as to what was deemed acceptable. Catherine was not initially happy with <b>Vigée</b> <b>Le</b> Brun's portrait of her granddaughters, Elena and Alexandra Pavlovna, due to the area of bare skin the short sleeved gowns revealed. In order to please the Empress, <b>Vigée</b> <b>Le</b> <b>Brun</b> added sleeves, thereby giving the work its characteristic look. This tactic seemed effective in pleasing Catherine, as she agreed to sit herself for <b>Vigée</b> <b>Le</b> <b>Brun</b> (although Catherine died of a stroke before this work was due to begin).|$|R
