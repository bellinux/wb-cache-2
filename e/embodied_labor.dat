5000|$|In simple models (e.g., that of Leontief), the {{definition}} of 'labor embodied in goods' is straightforward. With more complicated production sets, it is not, and hence {{the definition}} of exploition is not obvious. Roemer's program was then to propose definitions of <b>embodied</b> <b>labor</b> time, for economies with more general production sets, which would preserve the CECP. This led to the observation that, for general production sets, <b>embodied</b> <b>labor</b> time cannot be defined before one knows equilibrium prices. Thus, contrary to Marx, labor value is not a concept which is more fundamental than prices.|$|E

Relative advantage simply meant that the ratio of the <b>labor</b> <b>embodied</b> in the two commodities differed between two countries, such that each country would have at least one commoditiy where the relative amount of <b>labor</b> <b>embodied</b> would be less than that of the other country.|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of making economical use of society's material resources will grow with {{the scale of}} production, {{not only because of}} the absolute increase in the mass of raw materials, supplies, fuel, and fixed capital involved in the production process, but also because the growth of the social productivity of labor will mean a relative increase in the share of <b>embodied</b> <b>labor</b> and a reduction in the share of live labor per unit of output. Despite the systematic rise in the wage level, between 1932 and 1975 the share of wages in costs per unit of industrial output was reduced by more than half, whereas the share of raw materials, fuel, supplies, and power increased from 52. 2 to 74. 4 %.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to cost structure analysis {{by the use of}} input-output methods is proposed and applied to the investigation of post-war technological progress in the Japanese economy. The analysis is based on seven comparable input-output tables for 1951 - 1980. The methodology employed has two key steps. First, the input coefficients a are divided into two distinct components, one representing inputs of materials that are embodied in the product of the industry, and the other representing inputs of capital goods to replace capital "consumed" in the production process. The second step is to determine the corresponding indirect labor contributions (for "materials" and capital). Thus, total labor requirements for each sector are divided into three components: direct <b>labor,</b> <b>labor</b> <b>embodied</b> in purchased materials, and <b>labor</b> <b>embodied</b> in capital depreciation. The reduction of the total labor requirements for 18 industries from 1950 through 1988 is then disaggregated into direct labor savings, material savings, and capital savings components. The relative importance of these three cost-saving elements is analyzed from the viewpoint of long waves...|$|R

40|$|The net {{imports of}} <b>labor</b> <b>embodied</b> in {{international}} trade has been a fairly small and stable share of the US labor force. From this some conclude that trade {{has not been a}} major contributor to the income inequality trends. This is a non sequitur. The <b>labor</b> <b>embodied</b> in trade is jointly determined by tastes, technologies, factor supplies and the external goods market. Although it is impossible to use factor contents to disentangle trade from technology, the factor contents can be used to suggest the change of earnings shares if the country were to close down external trade entirely. However, this is a proper application of factor contents only if tastes and technologies are log-linear, if trade is balanced and if foreign input intensities are used to compute factor contents of non-competing imports. Factor contents are virtually useless if technologies and tastes are not log-linear, or if the external deficit is substantial and variable. Factor contents do not tell us anything about earnings levels as opposed to shares. They also do not inform us of the impact of partial trade barriers that change relative product prices but do not completely eliminate trade. In other words, the title question is rhetorical. ...|$|R

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} find {{that as of}} 2015, a {{significant}} share of working-age adults in the United States participates in nonstandard work arrangements. Such arrangements tend to lack long-term employment contracts and are {{often referred to as}} "gig economy" jobs. This paper investigates the implications of nonstandard or "informal" work for the measurement of employment status and labor market slack. Using original survey data, we find that as of 2015 roughly 37 percent of nonretired U. S. adults participated in some type of informal work, and roughly 20 percent participated in informal incomegenerating activities that did not exclusively involve renting out their own property or selling their own goods. The survey also elicits an individual's employment status according to the definitions of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). While not the majority, a significant share of those who engage in informal work are classified as not being in the labor force; if all informal workers were counted as employed, the U. S. labor force participation rate (as of 2015) would have been 2 percentage points higher. In addition, individuals who are classified as working "part-time for economic reasons" - those who would like a full-time job but cannot obtain full-time hours - have the highest participation rate in informal work and the highest average hours per month. This latter finding suggests that informal work <b>embodies</b> <b>labor</b> market slack, and we offer several pieces of evidence that support the thesis that workers engage in informal work as a way to compensate for weak labor demand and may therefore drop informal work as formal labor market conditions improve. To estimate the amount of <b>labor</b> market slack <b>embodied</b> in informal work, we convert the total hours of informal work performed by those classified as employed part-time into a number of full-time job equivalents. This exercise yields a figure that ranges from roughly 275, 000 to roughly 400, 000, depending on the specifics of the calculation. At the same time, we point out that a significant share of informal work hours offer higher wages than what the same individuals earn in their formal jobs. Therefore, formal wages may need to increase by a relatively large margin moving forward in order to attract additional labor into the formal sector...|$|R
40|$|The {{output of}} {{transport}} is created and consumed at {{one and the}} same time. This occurs in the very process of the work of transport, the useful effect of which is inseparable from the production process. Economically this is expressed in the fact that expenditures of live and <b>embodied</b> <b>labor</b> on transport do not create new material goods even though they increase the social value of products. The latter circumstance is also very important, in particular, in the study of rent relations in agriculture. Agricultural production is performed on land, various plots of which differ from one another {{not only in terms of}} fertility and climatic features but also in terms of distance from points of product delivery and points for obtaining various supplies. As a result, other things being equal, the difference in transport costs associated with the shipment of freight exerts an influence â sometimes a very substantial influence â on the cost of agricultural products produced at different enterprises. The problem of equalizing the economic conditions on collective and state farms cannot be successfully resolved without consideration of the transport factor, the significance of which can be judged, e. g., on the basis of the data in Table 1. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a series}} of visual representations of illegalized migration in order to consider how they respond {{to the presence of}} labor within global systems of economic exchange. Through an examination of the aesthetic qualities of these images it suggests that the worker’s body is repeatedly represented as a kind of specter or ghost. The paper considers how far this depiction {{is a product of the}} technical limitations on imaging migrants as they covertly pass across national borders and also how far it is a result of the bureaucratic restriction upon the attempts to record such images. It concludes that while these images partly demonstrate the forms of power that are exercised in policing the border they also question some of the key assumptions that sit at the heart of neoliberal trading regimes. In particular, the paper indicates how the separation of labor and freight, which command quite different treatment in narratives of market freedom, is undermined by the visual blending of the workers body with cargo. In reading these images through the figure of the ghost, the paper argues that the commoditization of labor power is made explicit by the reappearance of <b>embodied</b> <b>labor</b> in the spaces for traded goods. In such a way, these images implicitly re-articulate the Marxist critique of the commodity’s fetish-like character by highlighting the invisibilities that this involves...|$|E
