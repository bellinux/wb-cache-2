Such flow is called viscous <b>drag</b> <b>flow</b> or laminar flow, {{as opposed to the}} turbulent flow measured by orifice plates, Venturis and other meters mentioned in this section, and is characterized by Reynolds numbers below 2000. The primary flow element may consist of a single long capillary tube, a bundle of such tubes, or a long porous plug; such low flows create small pressure differentials but longer flow elements create higher, more easily measured differentials. These flow meters are particularly sensitive to temperature changes affecting the fluid viscosity and the diameter of the flow element, {{as can be seen in}} the governing Hagen-Poiseuille equation.|$|E

The purpose of this research is to describe the <b>flow</b> <b>drag</b> and heat transfer reduction characteristics of organic (potassium acetate) and inorganic (calcium chloride) brine solutions. The nonionic surfactant oleyl dihydroxyethyl amine oxide (ODEAO) is used as a drag-reducing additive. The pipe friction coefficient and heat transfer coefficient are investigated experimentally in a straight pipe for each type of solution with ODEAO. These coefficients are found to be lower than those of water in the turbulent flow range. However, the rod-like micelles of ODEAO, which are necessary to induce the <b>flow</b> <b>drag</b> reduction effect, are not readily formed in these solutions. Hence, the <b>flow</b> <b>drag</b> and heat transfer reduction effects are measured only under limited conditions {{and it is difficult to}} apply these solutions practically as heat transfer media...|$|R

By applying the concept of elastic shear stress or the Reynolds shear stress deficit, the equations of velocity distribution and friction factor in turbulent <b>drag</b> reducing <b>flows</b> are derived. Based on the derived equations, the onset Reynolds number for drag reduction is discussed which shows that the onset of drag reduction depends on the polymer type and its concentration. The optimal polymer concentration for Maximum Drag Reduction (MDR) is obtained, and it depends only on the polymer species.

Particles are injected into a carrier flow that passes through the separation chamber, with an external separating force (a DEP force) being applied perpendicular to the flow. By means of different factors, such as diffusion and steric, hydrodynamic, dielectric and other effects, or a combination thereof, particles (<1 Î¼m in diameter) with different dielectric or diffusive properties attain different positions away from the chamber wall, which, in turn, exhibit different characteristic concentration profile. Particles that move further away from the wall reach higher positions in the parabolic velocity profile of the liquid flowing through the chamber and will be eluted from the chamber at a faster rate.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} drag on an {{idealized}} relativistic MHD wind of radial geometry are studied. The astrophysical motivation {{is to understand}} the effects of radiation drag on the dynamics of a jet or wind passing through the intense radiation field of an accreting compact object. From a critical point analysis, {{it is found that}} a slow magnetosonic point can appear in a <b>dragged</b> <b>flow</b> {{even in the absence of}} gravitational force, as a result of a balance between the drag force and the combination of thermal pressure and centrifugal forces. As in the undragged case, the Alfven point does not impose any constraints on the flow. Although it is formally possible for a <b>dragged</b> <b>flow</b> to possess more than one fast magnetosonic point, it is shown that this is unlikely in practice. In the limit of a 'cold', centrifugally driven flow, it is shown that the fast magnetosonic point moves to infinite radius, just as in the drag-free case. For a given mass flux, the total energy output carried to infinity, and the final partition between the kinetic energy and the Poynting flux, are the same for the dragged and the drag-free flows. The main effects of radiation drag are to increase the amount of energy and angular momentum extracted from the source and to redistribute the regions where acceleration occurs in the flow. This is accomplished through the storage and release of magnetic energy, as a result of additional winding and compression of the field caused by the action of the drag. For a relativistic wind, the dissipated energy can exceed the final kinetic energy of the flow and may be comparable to the total flow energy (which is dominated by Poynting flux). The energy lost to radiation drag will appear as a Doppler-boosted beam of scattered radiation, which could dominate the background radiation if the flow is well-collimated...|$|R

A previous work has shown that flow is generated from {{the tips of the}} projections of the emitter electrode towards the smooth electrodes because of ion drag phenomenon and that the flow may detach part of the contaminant particles captured on the smooth electrodes and may be the principal cause of the saturation of the filtration speed at higher applied voltages and oil temperatures. In order to minimize the bad influence of the ion <b>drag</b> <b>flow</b> on the filter performance, {{it is important to be}} able to predict the flow in filters of various configurations by numerical simulation.

40|$|The {{surfactant}} used in {{this study}} is well known as an additive for drag reduction in straight (non-swirling) pipe flow. This paper deals with swirling flow characteristics of a surfactant solution. We investigated the effects of surfactant concentration and Reynolds number on flow characteristics. It is shown that the drag reducing effect is less than in straight pipe flow, and that the surfactant solution must be highly concentrated with great elasticity in order to produce a drag reduction. As the results of velocity measurement by LDV and wall pressure measurement in the axial direction, it is expected that the swirl intensity of the <b>drag</b> reducing swirling <b>flow</b> with a surfactant decays more quickly as the flow progresses downstream. And we propose that this mechanism helps create the drag reduction in swirling flow. For the velocity profiles of <b>drag</b> reducing swirling <b>flow,</b> only the forced-vortex type is observed in this experiment. This suggests that the velocity profiles of <b>drag</b> reducing swirling <b>flow</b> change more quickly to a forced-vortex type from a Rankin's combined vortex type.

30|$|As the {{dominant}} transport fluid property, high crude oil viscosity poses great challenges to oil production, refining and transportation through wells and pipeline. The viscous drag, wall friction and {{pressure drop in}} the pipeline are much higher in heavy oil compared to conventional light oils. The drag {{is the result of}} stresses at the wall due to fluid shearing causing a drop in fluid pressure (Martinez-Palou et al. 2011). This makes it challenging to pump the oil through a long distance. Therefore, drag reduction is a lubrication technique based on core-annular flow to reduce pressure in the transport of heavy oil via pipelines. The commonly used techniques to lower the friction to enhance pipeline transportation of heavy crude oil include drag-reducing additives and core-annular flow. Both technologies reduce <b>flow</b> <b>drag</b> by varying the velocity field such as dampening the turbulent fluctuation in the near wall region of the pipeline, while the flow in the heavy oil pipeline is laminar or slightly turbulent with minimum flow resistance based on viscosity influence on <b>flow</b> <b>drag</b> (Chen et al. 2009). However, most studies on <b>flow</b> <b>drag</b> reduction pay attention mainly to reducing the viscosity by physical or chemical methods, but according to Newtonâs viscosity law <b>flow</b> <b>drag</b> depends upon fluid viscosity and velocity profile.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{principle}} of separating the cells inside CCE is {{the balance between}} centrifugal force and the counter <b>flow</b> <b>drag</b> force. When the cells enter the elutriation chamber, all the cells will stay at {{the outer edge of}} the chamber due to centrifugal force. Then when we increase the flow rate of the buffer solution, due to the special design of the CCE, the solution tends to push the cells towards the middle of the CCE: we call this counter <b>flow</b> <b>drag</b> force. As the flow rate of the buffer solution increase, when the counter <b>flow</b> <b>drag</b> force outweigh the centrifugal force the smaller cells will be driven by the net force and leave the chamber first. In contrast the larger cells will stay within the elutriation chamber. So the cells escape from the elutriation chamber can be collected in the exit of the system.|$|R

40|$|This paper conducts an {{analysis}} of convective heat transfer of magnetic nanofluids in an isothermally heated microtube. The main purpose is to investigate the influences of particle volume fraction and external magnetic field strength on the fluid velocity, temperature, pressure, pressure drop, <b>flow</b> <b>drag,</b> and heat transfer rate. Firstly, a flow and heat transfer model is built. A water-based magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) nanofluid is then pre-pared, and a thermal flow test system is further de-signed, so as to verify the theoretical model with experimental data. Finally, the thermal flow fields and the corresponding characteristics are numerically analyzed by using the marching implicit (MI) procedure. The results reveal that when the particle volume fraction is increased, the average <b>flow</b> <b>drag</b> also increases while the average heat transfer rate goes down. Furthermore, as the external magnetic field strength is increased, the average <b>flow</b> <b>drag</b> rises and the average heat transfer rate also rises in the general case...|$|R

Drag depends on the surface wetting, nanobubbles, surface charge and boundary slip. Some researchers have focused on the relationship between these interface properties. In this review, the influence of an applied voltage on the surface wettability, nanobubbles, surface charge density and slip length are discussed. The contact angle (CA) and contact angle hysteresis (CAH) of a droplet of deionized (DI) water on a hydrophobic polystyrene (PS) surface were measured with applied direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) voltages. The nanobubbles in DI water and three kinds of saline solution on a PS surface were imaged when a voltage was applied. The influence of the surface charge density on the nanobubbles was analyzed.
