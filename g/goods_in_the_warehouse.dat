But if too much inventory, it will cause harm to the company because the company has issued a number of costs for treatment of the goods. In addition, the company's funds will be allocated to carry too much inventory purchases. Based on research that has been done, there are some problems faced by the Regional Water Company (PDAM) Tirta Sakti related to inventory management. The problem is the difficulty of PDAM Tirta Way office in determining whether certain types of goods are still available at eight branches or warehouses. This could be due to the unclear recording of goods {{in and out of the}} barn. In addition, other problems are frequent delays in the procurement process that resulted in running out of stock of goods in a warehouse in central and branch warehouses. This has happen because there is no clear safety stock that can be used as a basis when to re-order goods. The absence of a good coding system of goods also causes problems. This is due to the items contained in the warehouse is well organized neatly so many different kinds of goods are mixed with each other. As a result, the warehouse had difficulty in determining whether the item is still available in the warehouse or not. Therefore, inventory management information system design is to overcome the above problems.

Besides the integration of Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors to localize objects and find locations outdoor, the number of applications collecting indoor location related information is uncountable. Currently developed applications are designed to incorporate indoor location depending functionality. nbsp;example one can use a mobile guide to accompany visitors in an exhibition, monitor elderly people at home or trace <b>goods</b> <b>in</b> a <b>warehouse.</b> <b>The</b> needed localization accuracy is strongly application dependent.
