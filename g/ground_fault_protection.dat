25|$|High-resistance {{grounding}} (HRG) systems use an NGR {{to limit}} the fault current to 25A or less. They have a continuous rating, and are designed to operate with a single-ground fault. This means that the system will not immediately trip on the first ground fault. If a second ground fault occurs, a <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> <b>protection</b> relay must trip the breaker to protect the circuit. On an HRG system, a sensing resistor is used to continuously monitor system continuity. If an open-circuit is detected (e.g., due to a broken weld on the NGR), the monitoring device will sense voltage through the sensing resistor and trip the breaker. Without a sensing resistor, the system could continue to operate without ground protection (since an open circuit condition would mask the ground fault) and transient overvoltages could occur.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} stator <b>ground</b> <b>faults</b> <b>protection</b> schemes {{available}} in the industry. These schemes relatively perform well in detecting the faults in the stator winding. The protection of the neutral point vicinity is the challenge because of the low voltage induced in that area. The 100 % stator protection concept {{has been around for}} a long time. However, these schemes sometimes have limitations. The fact that stator <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> detection in generators depends on many factors like the generator design, the generator loading, and the equivalent capacitance of the generator?s windings and the apparatus connected to it, occasionally caused these schemes to fail to detect the winding faults near the neutral or to miss-operate during normal system disturbance. In this dissertation, an electromagnetic analysis of the synchronous generators stator winding <b>ground</b> <b>faults</b> is presented. A mathematical model for the synchronous generator under stator winding fault is being derived. In addition, a study is conducted using 2 D FEA simulation and verified using experimental testing on the third harmonic ratio under-voltage protection scheme. Another study focuses on finding a unique signature for the stator <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> using wavelet transform. This analysis is an attempt to understand this phenomenon from the machine design point of view by looking at the generator terminal and neutral voltages. The analysis presented in this dissertation shows that the protection schemes perform positively in detecting stator <b>ground</b> <b>fault.</b> However, it does not show reliable performance under system disturbances. On the other hand, the wavelet method shows better performance and it reflects robustness against these disturbances...|$|R

40|$|In {{electrical}} power systems, the fault frequently involves arcing and burning {{for all the}} wiring exposed to mechanical damage and other insulation stresses including wiring not fixed and connected by flexible cords and cables. The IEC Standard 60364 stops the design of electric power systems at the outlets of branch circuits or at the fixed equipment. A complete design instead should {{take care of the}} connections of the portable equipment and of extension cords (as requested by NFPA 70) that are exposed to arc-faults and may cause fire and/or electric shock hazard. The cords supplying the Class II equipment are without a grounding protection conductor, so the failure of the double insulation, caused by external damage, can't be expected to be easily detected as a <b>ground</b> <b>fault.</b> A <b>protection</b> must be provided to prevent the fault from extinguishing itself without being detected and remaining energized, thus presenting an electric shock hazard by direct contact with a live part, rendered accessible after local insulation failure.

The methods of connecting the generator terminal also influence the range of third harmonic voltage at the stator terminal and neutral. An investigation into the compatibility of particular generator configuration with the third harmonic scheme is important to prevent protection mal-operation since the scheme is hampered in performance by certain factors which include grounding method employed and generator terminal connection among others.
