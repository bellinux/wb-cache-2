Rotordynamics constraints {{to meet a}} design objective maximum operating speed of 18000 rpm resulted in a rotor with a 51. 0 in bearing span and 5. 0 in diameter tilting pad journal bearings. This configuration yielded a design with projected bearing loads of less than 25 psi, and journal surface speeds that could approach 400 ft/sec. Under these conditions, the applicable limits of conventional style tilting pad journal bearings are stretched, since operation is well into the turbulent flow regime. This can result in significantly higher than predicted operating pad temperatures and increased frictional losses. Furthermore, at very light pad loads, bearing dynamic performance and influence on rotor behavior often does not correlate well with theory. For this application, high efficiency leading <b>edge</b> <b>groove</b> bearings (journal and thrust) were used, due to their preferred steady state operating characteristics at high speed. However, as is often observed with lightly loaded conventional style journal bearings, dynamic performance did not precisely match that predicted by theory. This was investigated by profiling the exit side of the leading <b>edge</b> <b>groove</b> with both a tapered and pocket geometry. Two case histories are presented demonstrating their effect on rotor-bearing stability and unbalance response.

50|$|Nearly all {{small bore}} firearms, with the {{exception}} of shotguns, have rifled barrels. The rifling imparts a spin on the bullet, which keeps it from tumbling in flight.

40|$|The {{presence}} of debris, defects and deformations of endodontic reciprocating instruments {{before and after}} chemical-mechanical preparation (MCP) was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The following 26 instruments were divided into 2 groups: Waveone (n= 13) and Reciproc (n= 13) and examined by SEM (150 x magnification) prior to canal preparation at 2 and 4 mm from the tip.

40|$|Time-resolved {{diffraction}} microscopy {{technique has}} been used to observe the formation of laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) from the interaction of a single femtosecond laser pulse (pump) with a nano-scale groove mechanically formed on a single-crystal Cu substrate.

The LIPSS ripples are observed to form sequentially outward from the <b>groove</b> <b>edge,</b> with the first one forming after 50 ps.

40|$|It is {{generally}} acknowledged {{that in most}} circumstances, some special treatment of an asphalt surface is required to improve aircraft braking in wet conditions. It is increasingly common for transverse grooves to be sawn in the runway surface for this purpose. Grooves introduce a number of potential distress mechanisms that are not present in an ungrooved surface including, rubber filling the grooves, reduction of groove depth due to surface erosion, <b>groove</b> <b>edge</b> break and <b>groove</b> closure. Groove loss by closure is the most concerning form of distress as this usually occurs early in the surface's life and cannot be corrected by re-sawing the grooves. Asphalt resurfacing and regrooving after removal of the closed grooves is required. In addition, maintenance activities such as crack filling, surface rejuvenation sprayed treatments, patching and resurfacing, require additional consideration when grooves are present. Despite the difficulties associated with grooves, sawing of grooves is now the most common method used for improving aircraft braking performance on wet asphalt runways...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{theoretically}} {{study the}} influence of a nonmagnetic spacer between ferromagnetic dots and a ferromagnetic matrix on the frequency dispersion of the spin-wave excitations in two-dimensional bicomponent magnonic crystals. By means of the dynamical matrix method we investigate structures that are inhomogeneous across the thickness represented by square arrays of cobalt or permalloy dots in a permalloy matrix. We show that the introduction of a nonmagnetic spacer significantly modifies the total internal magnetic field, especially at the <b>edges</b> of the <b>grooves</b> and dots. This permits the manipulation of the magnonic band structure of spin waves localized either {{at the edges of the}} dots or in matrix material at the <b>edges</b> of the <b>grooves.</b> According to the micromagnetic simulations two types of end modes were found. The corresponding frequencies are significantly influenced by the end modes’ localization region. We also show that, with the use of a single ferromagnetic material, it is possible to design a magnonic crystal preserving the properties of bicomponent magnonic crystals and magnonic antidot lattices. Finally, {{the influence of}} the nonmagnetic spacers on the technologically relevant parameters such as group velocity and magnonic bandwidth are discussed...|$|R

40|$|A new {{directional}} {{acoustic lens}} is introduced. The geometry {{is very similar}} to the line-focus lens except the lens cavity, which is shaped as a groove with flat-bottom V cross section. The slanted planar <b>edges</b> of the <b>groove</b> are inclined in order to generate waves incident on the object surface at a critical angle. Hence, the <b>edges</b> of the <b>groove</b> act like two wedge transducers facing each other. The cross section of the lens is {{the same as that of}} the Lamb Wave Lens. Therefore, it enjoys the same sensitivity to surface wave excitations. On the other hand, since the cross section remains the same along one of the lateral directions, it has directional properties very similar to that of the Line Focus Beam Lens. The waves normally incident on the object surface generated from the flat-bottom, interfere with those at the critical angle, giving rise to a V(Z) effect. Calculated responses of the lens are presented for silicon (001) surface as a function of crystal orientation. The calculated curves are compared with measurement results. The leaky wave velocities are extracted from the measurement results using the conventional FFT algorithm. A new model based algorithm is proposed for extracting the velocity information from V(Z) data...|$|R
