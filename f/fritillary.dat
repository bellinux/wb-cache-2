5|$|Chaparral {{is a type}} of shrubland, {{receiving}} {{very little}} precipitation. Sclerophyllous plants such as manzanita and buckbrush grow in this area, both relying on fire to reproduce. The rare Gentner's <b>fritillary</b> also grows in this region.|$|E
5|$|Cheddar Wood and {{the smaller}} Macall's Wood form a {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest from {{what remains of the}} wood of the Bishops of Bath and Wells in the 13thcentury and of King Edmund the Magnificent's wood in the 10th. During the 19thcentury, its lower fringes were grubbed out to make strawberry fields. Most of these have been allowed to revert to woodland. The wood was coppiced until 1917. This site compromises a wide range of habitats which include ancient and secondary semi-natural broadleaved woodland, unimproved neutral grassland, and a complex mosaic of calcareous grassland and acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. Cheddar Wood is one of only a few English stations for starved wood-sedge (Carex depauperata). Purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum), a nationally rare plant, also grows in the wood. Butterflies include silver-washed <b>fritillary</b> (Argynnis paphia), dark green <b>fritillary</b> (Argynnis aglaja), pearl-bordered <b>fritillary</b> (Boloria euphrosyne), holly blue (Celastrina argiolus) and brown argus (Aricia agestis). The slug Arion fasciatus, which has a restricted distribution in the south of England, and the soldier beetle Cantharis fusca also occur.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{species at}} the gorge include dormice, yellow-necked mice, slowworms and adders and the rare large blue {{butterfly}} (Maculinea arion), and small pearl-bordered <b>fritillary</b> (Boloria selene).|$|E
25|$|Gulf <b>fritillaries</b> {{are found}} in open habitats, like in {{moderately}} sunny areas near open grasslands, parks, and woodlands. Gulf <b>fritillaries</b> are also commonly seen in local butterfly gardens across the U.S.|$|R

5|$|Quants, a {{grassland}} clearing in a forestry plantation {{well known}} for its butterflies including Duke of Burgundy, marsh <b>fritillary</b> and wood white, {{is a candidate for}} Special Area of Conservation (cSAC). These are designated under the European Commission Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) as internationally important habitats.|$|E
5|$|The birds seen on Brean Down include {{peregrine}} falcon, jackdaw, kestrel, collared {{and stock}} doves, common whitethroat, common linnet, stonechat, dunnock, rock pipit and– in 2007 – Britain's {{first and only}} Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross. There are also several species of butterfly, including chalkhill blue, dark green <b>fritillary,</b> meadow brown, marbled white, small heath, and common blue.|$|E
5|$|Wildflowers, which bloom {{mainly in}} the spring and early summer, include pincushions, golden bee plant, dwarf purple monkey flower, and {{sagebrush}} mariposa lily at the Painted Hills Unit. Munro's globemallow, lupines, yellow <b>fritillary,</b> hedgehog cactus, and Applegate's Indian paintbrush are commonly seen at the Clarno and Sheep Rock units.|$|E
25|$|Gulf <b>fritillaries</b> have a {{chemical}} defense mechanism {{in which they}} release odorous chemical sin response to predator sightings. Common predators learn to avoid this species. Pheromones {{play a critical role}} in male-female courtship behaviors, with male gulf <b>fritillaries</b> emitting sex pheromones that contribute to mate choice in females.|$|R

5|$|Nearby is the Dunster Park and Heathlands Site of Special Scientific Interest {{noted for}} nationally {{important}} lowland dry heath, dry lowland acid grassland, wood-pasture with veteran trees and ancient semi-natural oak woodland habitats. The fauna of the lowland heath includes the heath <b>fritillary</b> (Mellicta athalia), a nationally rare butterfly. The assemblage of beetles {{associated with the}} veteran trees is of national significance because of the variety and abundance of species.|$|E
5|$|One of the project's {{goals is}} to protect, restore and create areas of reedbed, grazing marsh, fen, raised bog, lowland meadow, purple moor grass and rush {{pastures}} and wet woodland. Species of conservation concern (UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species) {{that are likely to}} benefit from this project include plants such as: divided sedge (Carex divisa), English sticky eyebright (Euphrasia anglica), greater water parsnip (Sium latifolium), lesser butterfly orchid (Platanthera bifolia), marsh stitchwort (Stellaria palustris) and tubular water dropwort (Oenanthe fistulosa). The flora provides a habitat for several species of invertebrates. These include moths such as the argent and sable moth (Rheumaptera hastata), narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus) and narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus). While butterfly species include the small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), pearl-bordered <b>fritillary</b> (Boloria euphrosyne) and small pearl-bordered <b>fritillary</b> (Boloria selene). Beetles found in the valley include the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides) and one-grooved diving beetle (Bidessus unistriatus). There are also shining ram's-horn snails (Segmentina nitida) and shrill carder bees (Bombus sylvarum).|$|E
5|$|Rare vagrant species {{spotted in}} the area include lesser yellowlegs, white-rumped sandpiper, Pallid Harrier (in spring) and Richard's pipit (in autumn). The birds seen on Brean Down include {{peregrine}} falcon, jackdaw, kestrel, collared and stock doves, whitethroat, linnet, stonechat, dunnock and rock pipit. There are also several species of butterfly, including chalkhill blue, dark green <b>fritillary,</b> meadow brown, marbled white, small heath, and common blue.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of host plants for gulf <b>fritillaries</b> come from Lantana and Passiflora, two genuses of flowering {{plants in the}} Verbenaceae and Passifloraceae families, respectively. Many of the adult butterflies use Lantana plants as their main nectar and food source whereas the Passiflora plants serve as the main resource and foodplants for the larvae. The Passiflora host plants are frequently called passion vines; in some Texan counties where this butterfly's population is high, gulf <b>fritillaries</b> will feed on specific species such as Passiflora lutea and Passiflora affinis. These passion vine plants are suitable host plants as they provide a good structure for larval host habitats which enables young populations of gulf <b>fritillaries</b> to be sufficiently nurtured and protected. The role of host plants is also integral to the oviposition of gulf <b>fritillaries,</b> as the female butterflies lay their eggs {{on or near the}} host plant.|$|R

50|$|Near to {{the town}} of Bluden, it is found with <b>fritillaries,</b> Tulipa and Romula.|$|R
5|$|The varied age and canopy {{structure}} of woodland encourages a high diversity of butterflies, nationally scarce species including the white-letter hairstreak (Strymonidia walbum) and high brown <b>fritillary</b> (Argynnis edippe), while {{species such as}} the chalkhill blue (Lysandra coridon) and brown argus (Aricia agestis) occur on the limestone grassland. Greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and lesser horseshoes (Rhinolophus hipposideros) regularly use sites in the Gorge as hibernacular roosts. The site also supports birds of prey and a few red deer.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are almost}} {{invariably}} laid on plants. Each species of butterfly {{has its own}} host plant range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family. In some species, such as the great spangled <b>fritillary,</b> the eggs are deposited close to {{but not on the}} food plant. This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses its leaves in winter, as do violets in this example.|$|E
5|$|Several rare {{butterflies}} are {{indigenous to}} the area, including the nationally scarce pearl-bordered <b>fritillary</b> (Boloria euphrosyne), Duke of Burgundy (Hamearis lucina), and white-letter hairstreak (Satyrium w-album). The {{large blue butterfly}} (Maculinea arion) became extinct in the hills in the late 1970s, since when a research project has been undertaken into its ecology and reintroduction. The white-clawed crayfish is also nationally rare and is a declining species with small populations in {{a tributary of the}} Mells River and the River Chew.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>fritillaries</b> contain {{poisonous}} alkaloids such as imperialin {{and some}} {{may even be}} deadly if ingested in quantity.|$|R
25|$|In {{form and}} appearance, the pupae of gulf <b>fritillaries</b> are not recognizably uniform, but rather can vary in both {{coloring}} and physical size. The average {{duration of the}} pupal stage in gulf <b>fritillaries</b> is roughly between 7 and 12 days depending on {{the temperature of the}} environment. Colder temperatures are associated with the shorter time frame whereas warmer temperatures are associated with the longer pupal stage time frame.|$|R
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{discovered}} that this butterfly only mates one time in June or July and lays its eggs. [...] It does not provide any protection to these eggs or care for the offspring. [...] As adults, the Glanville <b>fritillaries</b> are short lived; they {{spend most of their}} lives as caterpillars. As caterpillars, Glanville <b>fritillaries</b> enter a stage of diapause, which is a period of suspended development, during the winter time.|$|R
5|$|The {{watershed}} {{is covered}} predominantly by temperate coniferous forest, which makes up approximately 64 {{percent of the}} total area. The primary species in these areas are Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, madrone, and incense-cedar. Buckbrush and manzanita grow in the drier chaparral regions. Several rare plants including Gentner's <b>fritillary,</b> oblongleaf stonecrop, Siskiyou lewisia, clustered lady's slipper, and splithair Indian paintbrush also grow in the watershed. Seven species of noxious weeds have been identified: three species of thistles, medusahead rye, Scotch broom, St. Johns wort, and tansy ragwort.|$|E
5|$|Still {{other animals}} seem to thrive {{regardless}} of the maturity of the forest or {{the presence of the}} understory. Common animals found in Quehanna include chipmunks, porcupine, and beaver, omnivores such as the black bear and raccoon, and predators like bobcat, red fox, and coyote (which has been in Pennsylvania since the 1930s). Many of the streams in Quehanna Wild Area are known for trout (brook, brown and rainbow); some populations are wild and others are stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association. The wild area is also home to timber rattlesnake, eastern garter snake, and spring peeper (a type of frog), as well as butterflies like great spangled <b>fritillary,</b> monarch, red-spotted purple, and black, eastern tiger, and spicebush swallowtails. Any of these mammals, especially the white-tailed deer, can carry ticks, and such tick-borne diseases as Lyme disease are a health concern for hikers.|$|E
5|$|Tessellations are {{patterns}} {{formed by}} repeating tiles all over a flat surface. There are 17 wallpaper groups of tilings. While common {{in art and}} design, exactly repeating tilings are less easy to find in living things. The cells in the paper nests of social wasps, and the wax cells in honeycomb built by honey bees are well-known examples. Among animals, bony fish, reptiles or the pangolin, or fruits like the salak are protected by overlapping scales or osteoderms, these form more-or-less exactly repeating units, though often the scales in fact vary continuously in size. Among flowers, the snake's head <b>fritillary,</b> Fritillaria meleagris, have a tessellated chequerboard pattern on their petals. The structures of minerals provide good examples of regularly repeating three-dimensional arrays. Despite {{the hundreds of thousands}} of known minerals, there are rather few possible types of arrangement of atoms in a crystal, defined by crystal structure, crystal system, and point group; for example, there are exactly 14 Bravais lattices for the 7 lattice systems in three-dimensional space.|$|E
25|$|Both {{male and}} female gulf <b>fritillaries</b> possess certain {{defensive}} glands located on their abdomens that serve as a defense mechanism against predators, especially avian predators such as birds. When the butterflies sense danger in the area or are suddenly disturbed, these glands emit a distinct and obvious odor which is composed of several different types of chemicals, such as 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one and hexadecyl acetate. The summation of these chemical compounds released from the glands leads to birds preferentially avoiding the gulf <b>fritillaries</b> in favor of other prey. In some cases, gulf <b>fritillaries</b> can sometimes be subjected to competition and fighting from other butterfly species, such as Heliconius charithonia vazquezae and Dryas iulia moderata when those species have breeding populations in similar areas and within the same geographic range.|$|R
50|$|The scarlet {{lily beetle}} (Lilioceris lilii) eats <b>fritillaries,</b> and {{may become a}} pest where these plants are grown in gardens.|$|R
2500|$|Heath <b>fritillaries</b> {{typically}} fly {{close to}} the ground, with characteristic [...] "flits" [...] and glides. Colonies tend to be compact, centred on favoured breeding areas. Heath <b>fritillaries</b> are highly sedentary for the most part, adults rarely moving more than 100m; however, some have been recorded dispersing up to 2km. For a species of often short-lived habitats, it has remarkably limited colonizing ability; suitable habitats over 600m from an existing colony are colonized slowly.|$|R
25|$|Brackens of the Northern Hemisphere {{are used}} as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} dark green <b>fritillary,</b> dot moth, high brown <b>fritillary,</b> gold swift, map-winged swift, pearl-bordered <b>fritillary,</b> orange swift, small angle shades, small pearl-bordered <b>fritillary.</b> They also form an important ecological partnership with plants such as violet and cow-wheat (Melampyrum pratense) for various Boloria <b>fritillary</b> species.|$|E
25|$|Rare {{plants that}} occur in Wanister Bog include devil's-bit scabious, Succisa pratensis, and marsh violet, Viola palustris. The former is the food plant of the marsh <b>fritillary,</b> Euphydryas aurinia, and the narrow-bordered bee hawk-moth, Hemaris tityus, while the latter is the food plant of the pearl-bordered <b>fritillary,</b> Boloria euphrosyne, and the small pearl-bordered <b>fritillary.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{parasitoid}} C. melitaearum can {{be extremely}} detrimental to Glanville <b>fritillary</b> populations if {{it is able to}} become well established. This species is able to increase its own parasitism if the <b>fritillary</b> population is also increasing in size and age, but will decrease if said population becomes isolated. Thus, in well established <b>fritillary</b> populations there is a risk of local extinction by the C. melitaearum parasitoid.|$|E
5|$|Medicinal plants include <b>fritillaries</b> (fritillaria), {{stonecrop}} (rhodiola), Indian barberry (berberis aristata), Chinese caterpillar fungus (ophiocordyceps sinensis), codonopsis and Lingzhi mushroom (ganoderma).|$|R
50|$|The adult {{butterflies}} may feed on {{a variety}} of nectar plants and their availability throughout the summer flight time can be as important as the presence of larval food plants in determining whether an area can support populations of butterfly species (Selby 2007). Milkweeds, thistles, coneflowers, blazing-stars, bergamots, clovers, goldenrods, and ironweeds {{are some of the most}} important nectar sources for adult regal <b>fritillaries.</b> Milkweeds and thistles have been observed to be the preferred nectar source throughout the regal <b>fritillary's</b> range (Selby 2007). These two types of plants provide a constant supply of nectar due to their staggered growth times. Common milkweed starts blooming when male regal <b>fritillaries</b> begin to emerge early in the summer and thistles tend to bloom later in the season which is crucial to females approaching oviposition (Selby 2007).|$|R
50|$|The upperside of {{the wings}} is pale orange with strong blackish brown markings, the {{underside}} has silvery spots, common to many <b>fritillaries.</b>|$|R
