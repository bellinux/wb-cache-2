5|$|Along with {{offering}} {{emotional support}} {{to both the}} patient and family, palliative care serves {{an important role in}} addressing goals of care. People with Parkinson's may have many difficult decisions to make as the disease progresses such as wishes for feeding tube, non-invasive ventilator, and tracheostomy; wishes for or against cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and when to use hospice care. Palliative care team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>make</b> the best decision based on their own values.|$|E
25|$|Takenaga's troops {{managed to}} shake off pursuit by the Australians, but decided that they would surrender. They took a leaflet {{containing}} a notice of surrender {{that one of the}} soldiers had been carrying, added some conditions underneath in English, tied it to a pole for the Australians to find, and left the area. Scouts from Miles' platoon then found the leaflet and brought it back with them. On 2 May, the Australian platoon spotted Takenaga's unit near Womgrer village, and asked a native to <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>make</b> contact. Two truce bearers from the Japanese side came to the Australians to negotiate, and on the following day Takenaga's unit surrendered at Womgrer and were disarmed. At the time of surrender, Takenaga's unit consisted of 42 men: 5 officers (including Takenaga), 4 warrant officers, and 33 non-commissioned officers and soldiers. They were equipped with 5 light machine guns, 17 rifles, 5 pistols, and 750 rounds of ammunition. The prisoners, escorted by Miles' platoon, marched for three days in an orderly fashion to Maprik Airport, and were then transported to Aitape.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{depictions of}} {{earthquakes}} in film are {{variable in the}} manner in which they reflect human psychological reactions to the actual trauma that can be caused to directly afflicted families and their loved ones. Disaster mental health response research emphasizes the need to be aware of the different roles of loss of family and key community members, loss of home and familiar surroundings, loss of essential supplies and services to maintain survival. Particularly for children, the clear availability of caregiving adults who are able to protect, nourish, and clothe them in the aftermath of the earthquake, and to <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>make</b> sense of what has befallen them has been shown even more important to their emotional and physical health than the simple giving of provisions. As was observed after other disasters involving destruction and loss of life and their media depictions, recently observed in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, it is also important not to pathologize the reactions to loss and displacement or disruption of governmental administration and services, but rather to validate these reactions, to support constructive problem-solving and reflection as to how one might improve the conditions of those affected.|$|E

500|$|The next day, Wendy and Max {{plan their}} lives together, asking Veronica to <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>make</b> Wendy [...] "disappear" [...] from her former life. A {{battered}} prostitute appears at Logan’s door and takes Wendy away, citing {{problems with their}} pimp, leaving Max heartbroken. Veronica finds a stain of purple makeup on a towel, and she immediately deduces that Wendy conned Max out of $1,000. Veronica blackmails a judge {{in order to secure}} the $1,000 back. Veronica and Logan ask each other personal questions in an attempt to become more intimate, but it fails. At the bus locker at which Veronica instructed the judge to leave the money, she instead finds a note that tells Veronica and Max to get in a limo. In the limo, they find Wendy’s pimp, who is actually a woman. She tells them that she actually did fall in love with Max, but that she needed money for other reasons.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{although}} the number of identified diagnoses has increased by more than 300% (from 106 in DSM-I to 365 in DSM-IV-TR), psychiatrists such as Zimmerman and Spitzer argue it almost entirely represents greater specification of the forms of pathology, thereby allowing better grouping of more similar patients. However, William Glasser refers to the DSM as [...] "phony diagnostic categories", arguing that [...] "it was developed to help psychiatrists – to <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>make</b> money". In addition, the publishing of the DSM, with tightly guarded copyrights, has in itself earned over $100million for the APA.|$|E

Named after Kmart's well-known [...] "Blue Light Specials", Mr. Bluelight was a talking cartoonish blue light bulb who gave customers ideas to <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>make</b> {{the most of}} their Kmart experience. Mr. Bluelight appeared in several television commercials. Specials associated with Mr. Bluelight inside Kmart stores were advertised as [...] "Blue Light Finds" [...] (marked-down merchandise) and [...] "Best of Blue" [...] (higher-end products, often brand-name). In late 2011, Kmart retired Mr. Bluelight.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the skill}} set {{of those in}} the {{ambulance}} increased, so did the importance of information. [...] Ambulance service moved from 'first come...first served' or giving priority to whoever sounded the most panicked, to {{trying to figure out what}} was actually happening, and the assignment of resources by priority of need. [...] This occurred slowly at first, with local initiatives and full-time ambulance dispatchers making best guesses. [...] Priority codes developed for ambulance dispatch, and became commonplace, although they have never been fully standardized. [...] As it became possible for those in the ambulance to actually save lives, the process of sending the closest appropriate resource to the person in the greatest need became very important. Dispatchers needed tools to <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>make</b> the correct decisions, and a number of products initially competed to provide that decision-support.|$|E

60|$|Now, {{here was}} Tom's bomb-shell to explode in their midst, {{carrying}} widespread destruction, perhaps; for though one swallow {{does not make}} a summer, one engagement is apt to make several, and her boys were, most of them, at the inflammable age when a spark ignites the flame, which soon flickers and dies out, or burns warm and clear for life. Nothing could be done about it but to <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>make</b> wise choices, and be worthy of good mates. But of all the lessons Mrs Jo had tried to teach her boys, this great one was the hardest; for love is apt to make lunatics of even saints and sages, so young people cannot be expected to escape the delusions, disappointments, and mistakes, as well as the delights, of this sweet madness.|$|E

We have to darn socks, and yet we're not content to think of nothing but socks and darning-cotton. I'd demand all I could get--whether I finally settled down to designing frocks or building temples or pressing pants. What if you do drop back? You'll have had the adventure. Don't be too meek toward life! Go! You're young, you're unmarried. Try everything!

60|$|Mrs. Bunker, or Mother Bunch, as Lucy and her {{brothers}} and sisters called her, was housekeeper to their Uncle Joseph. He was really their great uncle, and they thought him any age you can imagine. They {{would not have been}} much surprised to hear that he sailed with Christopher Columbus, though he was a strong, hale, active man, much less easily tired than their own papa. He had been a ship's surgeon in his younger days, and had sailed all over the world, and collected all sorts of curious things, besides which he was a very wise and learned man, and had made some great discovery. It was not America. Lucy knew that her elderly brother understood what it was, but it was not worth troubling her head about, only somehow it made ships go safer, and so he had had a pension given him as a reward. He had come home and bought a house about a mile out of town, and built up a high room from which to look at the stars with his telescope, and to try his experiments in, and a long one besides for his museum; yet, after all, he was not much there, for whenever there was anything wonderful to be seen, he always went off to look at it, and, whenever there was a meeting of learned men--scientific men was the right word--they always wanted him to <b>help</b> <b>them</b> <b>make</b> speeches and show wonders. He was away now. He had gone away to wear a red cross on his arm, and help {{to take care of the}} wounded in the sad war between the French and the Germans.|$|E
