[...] "It started off really good for us, unfortunately they just got a couple more runs than us and that's the way it goes sometimes. They played a great game. We stuck together 12 deep from the second the buzzer started, to that end buzzer and no one gave up. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> hold our heads high because of that. I guess the plan is, next four years, Rio we go one more." ...|$|E

She has shown herself a very fast boat the few times she has been raced, but so have we, and taking the line through boats <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have both sailed against, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{ought to be able to}} beat her." ...|$|R

"No doubt, sir--no doubt," [...] replied Chauvelin {{with more}} than his {{accustomed}} blandness; [...] "if you will hold yourself entirely at our disposition, Mademoiselle Lange will be set free to-morrow. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> safely promise that, citizen Heron, can we not?" [...] he added, turning to his colleague.|$|E
60|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> explain almost, if not quite, {{all that}} we know about earthquakes, if we believe that on the whole they are caused by steam and other gases expanding, that is, {{spreading}} out, with wonderful quickness and strength. Of course there must be something to make them expand, and that is heat. But we will not talk of that yet.|$|E

6000|$|But {{in writing}} of Synge I have run far ahead, for in 1896 he was but one picture among many. I am often {{astonished}} when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> meet unmoved some person, or pass some house, that {{in later years}} is to bear a chief part in our life. Should there not be some flutter of the nerve or stopping of the heart like that Macgregor experienced at the first meeting with a phantom? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{more quickly}} {{recognise}} this human {{interest in a}} flower, due to its colour, and best appreciate its æsthetic value from this cause, when we turn from the blues, purples, and reds, to the whites and the yellows. The feeling these last give us is distinctly different in character from that produced by the others. They are not like us, nor like any living sentient thing we are related to: there is no kinship, no human quality.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} your feeling, Mrs. Renshaw, {{and it is}} quite natural. I do think that everyone who can carry a musket ought to join in this expedition, and I flatter myself that Wilfrid's rifle and mine are allies not to be despised. Anyhow, Mrs. Renshaw, I promise you {{that we will not}} do what are called rash things. We won't try to capture Te Kooti single-handed, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> be much more useful covering an attack than leading an assault." ...|$|E

Say two of the wounded won't be able to lend a hand, that makes us twenty, {{to say nothing of}} Jake and Pedro. So, even if you took four hands, we should be pretty even in numbers; and if our men could not each whip two Belgians, they had better give up the sea." ...|$|E

"If the Prince of Orange did {{not find}} him too young to act in matters in which the {{slightest}} indiscretion might bring a score of heads to the block, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> trust him, my lord. In some respects his youth will be a distinct advantage. Did we send a personage of age and rank to Holland it might be suspected {{that he had a}} special mission from us, and our envoy might complain that we were treating behind his back; but a young officer like this could come and go without attracting observation, and without even Philip's spies suspecting that he was dabbling in affairs of state." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{seems to}} me that the god that is {{commonly}} worshipped in civilized countries is not at all divine, though he bears a divine name, but is the overwhelming authority and respectability of mankind combined. Men reverence one another, not yet God. If I thought that I could speak with discrimination and impartiality of the nations of Christendom, I should praise them, but it tasks me too much. They seem to be the most civil and humane, but I may be mistaken. Every people have gods to suit their circumstances; the Society Islanders had a god called Toahitu, [...] "in shape like a dog; he saved such as were in danger of falling from rocks and trees." [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do without him, as we have not much climbing to do. Among them a man could make himself a god out of a piece of wood in a few minutes, which would frighten him out of his wits.|$|E

If they talk to each other, no one will be able to divide them. I hope I will leave from Khartoum with positive results on the relations between Chad and Sudan, results which we will consolidate in Dakar."

5000|$|Concluding a theme {{brought up}} most {{explicitly}} in the Analogies of the Sun and Divided Line in Book VI, Socrates finally rejects {{any form of}} imitative art and concludes that such artists {{have no place in}} the just city. He continues on to argue for the immortality of the psyche and even espouses a theory of reincarnation. He finishes by detailing the rewards of being just, both in this life and the next. Artists create things but they are only different copies of the idea of the original. [...] "And whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all the arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single thing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man—whoever tells us this, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only imagine to be a simple creature who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and whom he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyze the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation." ...|$|E

5000|$|Kennedy {{delivered}} his first campaign speech on March 18 at Kansas State University, {{where he had}} previously agreed to give a lecture honoring former Kansas governor and Republican Alfred Landon. At Kansas State, Kennedy drew a [...] "record-setting crowd of 14,500 students" [...] for his Landon Lecture. In his speech, Kennedy apologized for early mistakes and attacked President Johnson's Vietnam policy saying, [...] "I was involved {{in many of the}} early decisions on Vietnam, decisions which helped set us on our present path." [...] He further acknowledged that [...] "past error is not excuse for its own perpetration." [...] Later that day at the University of Kansas Kennedy spoke to an audience of 19,000—one of the largest in the university's history. During that speech he said, [...] "I don't {{think that we have to}} shoot each other, to beat each other, to curse each other and criticize each other, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do better in this country. And that is why I run for President of the United States." [...] From Kansas, Kennedy went on to campaign in the Democratic primaries in Indiana, Washington, D.C., Nebraska, Oregon, South Dakota, and California.|$|E
5000|$|The {{team also}} found {{evidence}} of four older layers of turbidite, suggesting that such collapses have been a recurrent event since Lake Geneva formed {{at the end of}} the last Ice Age some 19,000 years ago. It is not yet known how frequently they have occurred - further investigation will be required to answer this question - but researcher Guy Simpson says, [...] "It's certainly happened before and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> expect that it will probably happen again sometime." [...] Although most people's focus has been on marine tsunamis such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the March 2011 tsunami in Japan, lakeside cities such as Geneva, 275 km from the sea, are also at risk. Katrina Kremer notes that the risk of a fresh tsunami still exists, not just in Lake Geneva, but in other mountain lakes as well: [...] "We have recognised that a tsunami risk applies to all lakes that have unstable slopes along the shore." [...] However, she warns, [...] "the risk is underestimated because most people just do not know that tsunamis can happen in lakes." [...] The risk is particularly pronounced for the city of Geneva, given its position on low ground at the funnel-shaped end of the lake, which magnifies the effects of a tsunami. The impact of a new tsunami on the whole of Lake Geneva would be far more severe now than in 563, as over a million people now live along the lake's shores.|$|E
30|$|Well, we {{are very}} strong in this area: “How is the life of our clients shifting?

And {{if we do not}} reflect this in our teams, then we will probably miss both potential trends as well as risks (Expert F).|$|E
