5000|$|The {{hepatitis}} B {{surface antigen}} (HBsAg) is {{most frequently used}} to screen {{for the presence of}} this infection. It is the first detectable viral antigen to appear during infection. However, early in an infection, this antigen may not be present and it may be undetectable later in the infection as it is being cleared by the host. The infectious virion contains an inner [...] "core particle" [...] enclosing viral genome. The icosahedral core particle is made of 180 or 240 copies of the core protein, alternatively known as <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>core</b> <b>antigen,</b> or HBcAg. During this 'window' in which the host remains infected but is successfully clearing the virus, IgM antibodies specific to the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>core</b> <b>antigen</b> (anti-HBc IgM) may be the only serological evidence of disease. Therefore, most hepatitis B diagnostic panels contain HBsAg and total anti-HBc (both IgM and IgG).|$|E

All were negative for HBV DNA. Nine (52. 9 %) of those vaccined had anamnestic response, mainly those with positive anti-HBe (8 / 10; 80 %). “Anti-HBc alone ” was compatible {{with low levels of}} anti-HBs in half of the patients, and probably with false positive results for anti-HBc in the others.

A HBcAg gene fragment was cloned into a pcDNA 3 eukaryotic expression vector.

Four-to 6 -week-old Balb/c mice were immunized with HBcAg expressing plasmids and the anti-HBcAg antibody responses of the mice were evaluated by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The results of this study indicated that HBcAg expressed from pcDNA 3 based eukaryotic expression vector induced an anti-HBcAg response when introduced intramuscularly into Balb/c mice.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} whether <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus (HBV) could induce a <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus <b>core</b> <b>antigen</b> (HBcAg) -specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in vitro by dendritic cells (DCs) transduced with lentiviral vector-encoding ubiquitinated <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus <b>core</b> <b>antigen</b> (LV-Ub-HBcAg). METHODS: Recombinant LV-Ub-HBcAg were transfected into highly susceptible 293 T cells to obtain high virus titres. Bone marrow-derived DCs isolated from BALB/c mice were cultured with recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and recombinant interleukin (IL) - 4. LV-Ub-HBcAg, lentiviral vector-encoding <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus <b>core</b> <b>antigen</b> (LV-HBcAg), lentiviral vector (LV) or lipopolysaccharide {{were added to}} induce DC maturation, and the DC phenotypes were analyzed by flow cytometry. The level of IL- 12 in the supernatant was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). T lymphocytes were proliferated using Cell Counting Kit- 8. DCs were cultured and induced to mature using different LVs, and co-cultured with allogeneic T cells to detect the secretion levels of IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 10 and interferon-&#x 3 B 3; in the supernatants of T cells by ELISA. Intracellular cytokines of proliferative T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, and specific CTL activity was measured by a lactate dehydrogenase release assay. RESULTS: LV-Ub-HBcAg-induced DCs secreted more IL- 12 and upregulated the expression of CD 80, CD 86 and major histocompatibility class II. DCs sensitised by different LVs effectively promoted cytokine secretion; the levels of IL- 2 and interferon-&#x 3 B 3; induced by LV-Ub-HBcAg were higher than those induced by LV-HBcAg. Compared with LV-HBcAg-transduced DCs, LV-Ub-HBcAg-transduced DCs more efficiently stimulated the proliferation of T lymphocytes and generated HBcAg-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

40|$|<b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus <b>core</b> <b>antigen</b> (HBcAg) {{is thought}} to be a major target for {{specific}} cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) in <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus infections. A single dose of hepatitis C virus nonstructural 3 / 4 A DNA (! 5 mg) effectively primes functional specific CTLs, independently of CD 4 + T helper cells and by different routes of immunization. In contrast, HBcAg-specific CTL priming was T helper cell dependent and highly sensitive to the dose and route of delivery. Although CTL priming was improved 10 -fold by codon optimization and in vivo electro-poration, low levels of DNA still failed to prime CTLs effectively. Only high doses (5 mg) of codon-optimized HBcAg delivered by in vivo electroporation primed in vivo lytic and polyfunctional CTLs. The ability of endogenous HBcAg to prime CTLs is surprisingly inefficient and differs from that of nonstructural 3 / 4 A. This has important implications for the design of HBcAg-based therapeutic vaccines in humans. <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus <b>core</b> <b>antigen</b> (HBcAg) {{is thought to}} be a key target for the host immune response in con-trolling the infection [1].

40|$|Background: The {{details of}} liver {{histology}} {{of patients with}} precore and core promoter mutations are still not clear. Aim: To determine the role of precore and core promoter mutations in liver histology in Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B. Patients and methods: Intrahepatic hepatitis B virus DNA (by COBAS Amplicor hepatitis B virus Monitor test) and precore and core promoter mutations (by a line probe assay) were measured in 54 chronic hepatitis B patients. Expression of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>core</b> <b>antigen,</b> hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B surface antigen was determined by immunohistological staining. Histological activity index was scored according to Knodell's criteria. Results: Compared with patients without core promoter mutations, patients with core promoter mutations had more severe intrahepatic inflammation and fibrosis, and more cytoplasmic expression of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>core</b> <b>antigen</b> (P = 0. 028). No such {{differences were found in}} patients with and without precore mutations. Logistic regression showed that core promoter mutations were independently associated with cytoplasmic expression of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>core</b> <b>antigen</b> (P = 0. 026). Intrahepatic hepatitis B virus DNA levels correlated with serum hepatitis B virus DNA levels (r = 0. 71, P < 0. 001) and the percentage of hepatitis B core antigen-positive hepatocytes (r = 0. 37, P = 0. 047), but had no correlation with serum alanine aminotransferase levels nor the degree of inflammation and fibrosis.
