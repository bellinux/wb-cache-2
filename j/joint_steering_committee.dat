While a number of possible models were considered, including that of a loose federation, the solution finally adopted was that of an integrated institution, Concordia University, operating under the existing charter of Sir George Williams University. Following several revisions in November 1972, the document became the main plan of the proposed merger. It was accepted by both institutions, which began the process of consolidating their operations.|$|E
500|$|The Planning Authority {{established}} the Anstey Hill <b>Joint</b> <b>Steering</b> <b>Committee</b> in 1981, initially {{to prepare a}} concept plan for development of the reserve. The draft report was published in late 1981 with a proposal to spend up to $3.5million establishing the park. Uses were explored including: a rock climbing area, motocross circuit, kiosk, cycle track, horse riding area, caravan and camping grounds and a restaurant. In 1983, the then state Department of Environment and Planning published the final concept plan for the [...] "Anstey Hill Regional Park". The plan indicated that a caravan park, or possibly a velodrome, might be an appropriate development. There was significant interest by developers to use parts of the park commercially. Increasing public opposition to this concept led to the declaration of the entire reserve as a public recreation park. The Friends of Anstey Hill Recreation Park volunteer group was formed in 1990. Most of the then [...] park was proclaimed on 31 August 1989 with a smaller [...] addition in October 2001. It was officially opened by Environment and Planning Minister Susan Lenehan in a ceremony on 17 September 1989. The Department for Environment and Heritage added one last section to the park in 2003. A wedge of land [...] remained from a purchase by George Dickerson in 1857. This land formed part of a cliff and had long been managed {{as part of the}} park. No known current owner was found and the Department compulsorily acquired the land and added it to the Recreation Park.|$|E

40|$|Reviewing {{progress}} to date an ECDPM review concludes {{that there has}} been 'little progress' in the EPA negotiations. A considerable divergence of views exists on: the modalities for concluding phase 1 (with the ACP wanting a formal agreement); the definition of the parties signatory to the EPAs in phase 2; additional funds beyond the EDF; a <b>joint</b> ACP-EU <b>steering</b> <b>committee</b> on WTO negotiations. In addition there is no agreement on either the approach or content of the discussions on development issues. The European Commission considers that the Cotonou Agreement adequately covers this dimension while the ACP believes that it is still inadequately addressed, and needs to be discussed separately. Similarly there is no agreement on discussing agricultural or service issues as distinct topics. To date no substantive issues have been discussed in phase 1, causing concern within the ACP. This situation needs to be seen {{in the context of the}} EC's opposition from the start to a substantive first phase at the all-ACP level. The paper maintains that the slow progress can also be attributed in part to the lack of capacity and experience with trade negotiations in many ACP countries. This is compounded by the sheer size of the ACP Group, which makes reaching a consensus very difficult. Reviewing {{progress to}} date an ECDPM review concludes that [...] ...|$|R
