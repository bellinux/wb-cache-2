5000|$|Émile Durkheim was {{concerned}} {{with the question of}} how certain societies maintain internal stability and survive over time.

Durkheim used the term mechanical solidarity to refer to these types of [...] "social bonds, based on common sentiments & shared moral values, that are strong among members of pre-industrial societies". In modern, complex societies, members perform very different tasks, resulting in a strong interdependence. Based on the metaphor above of an organism in which many parts function together to sustain the whole, Durkheim argued that complex societies are held together by organic solidarity, i.e. [...] "social bonds, based on specialization and interdependence, that are strong among members of industrial societies".|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a novel technique for identifying semantically <b>equivalent</b> <b>parts</b> in images {{belonging to the}} same object class, (e. g. eyes, license plates, aircraft wings etc.). The visual appearance of such object parts can differ substantially, and therefore traditional image similarity-based methods are inappropriate for this task.

We then use the context fragments in new images to infer the most likely position of <b>equivalent</b> <b>parts.</b> Given a set of image examples of objects in a class, the method can automatically learn the part structure of the domain – identify the main parts, and how their appearance changes across objects in the class. Two applications of the proposed algorithm are shown: the detection and identification of object parts and object recognition. 1...|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{mechanical}} design {{focuses on a}} single com-pletely specified nominal shape that is later toleranced to al-low for variations in form. The corresponding design pro-cesses usually involve arbitrary decisions affecting the geom-etry and do not support systematic generation of alternative shapes satisfying identical or altered functionalities. This places a serious handicap on the design cycle of a product, since most new designs are obtained by modifying existing products to comply with new functional specifications. Since the functionality of a part does not usually define all of its geometry, a more coherent approach would be to de-sign classes of equivalent mechanical parts that satisfy a given functionality. We show here that, by replacing the completely specified geometry of the traditional approaches with par-tial geometry and functional specification, we can generate classes of mechanical parts that are equivalent, {{in the sense that}} all members of the class satisfy the same functional spec-ifications. Ability to define, compute, and represent classes of func-tionally <b>equivalent</b> <b>parts</b> will allow one to generate, compare and modify functionally equivalent designs, perhaps having dissimilar geometries. We identify three such equivalence classes for artifacts with parts moving in contact, which pre-sume, at the very least, contact between parts, spatial contain-ment during their relative motion, and external loads applied on the moving parts. We show that these classes of function-ally <b>equivalent</b> <b>parts</b> are computable and may be represented unambiguously by maximal elements of each class...|$|E

When using model checking to verify such systems, {{this leads to a}} redundant search over <b>equivalent</b> <b>parts</b> of the state-space. Verification can even be intractable for concurrent systems due to the state-space explosion problem which model checking suffers from. Considerable memory savings can be achieved by using symmetry reduction when verifying systems which contain symmetries. However, sometimes verification time can significantly increase with symmetry reduction because of the time required to compute representatives of equivalent states. Therefore we investigate the efficient use of state symmetries. The use of state symmetries aims to avoid redundant computations of representatives. ...|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder that {{is characterized by the}} cerebral deposition of amyloid fibrils formed by Aβ peptide. Despite their prevalence in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, important details of the structure of amyloid fibrils remain unknown. Here, we present a three-dimensional structure of a mature amyloid fibril formed by Aβ(1 - 40) peptide, determined by electron cryomicroscopy at ≈ 8 -Å resolution. The fibril consists of two protofilaments, each containing ≈ 5 -nm-long regions of β-sheet structure. A local twofold symmetry within each region suggests that pairs of β-sheets are formed from <b>equivalent</b> <b>parts</b> of two Aβ(1 - 40) peptides contained in each protofilament. The pairing occurs via tightly packed interfaces, reminiscent of recently reported steric zipper structures. However, unlike these previous structures, the β-sheet pairing is observed within an amyloid fibril and includes significantly longer amino acid sequences...|$|E

However, in a special scaling limit our solution reproduces the supergravity background found by Maldacena and Russo.

40|$|The {{youngest}} {{parts of}} clonal plants benefit from substantial physiological support from older parts, but {{the extent to}} which this physiological dependence persists through time is poorly understood. The development of autonomy among connected subunits was therefore analysed in the clonal species Glechoma hederacea. The stolons of a series of clonal fragments with differing numbers of primary ramets were severed at a fixed point relative to the four oldest primary ramets. The subsequent growth of both parts of the severed fragments was compared with that of a series of intact fragments. The growth of apical stolon portions that included five or more rooted primary ramets at the time of severing was unaffected by severing. Apical portions with three or fewer rooted ramets at the time of severing produced fewer new primary ramets than <b>equivalent</b> <b>parts</b> of intact fragments, while apical portions with four or fewer rooted ramets produced less above-ground mass than equivalent apical portions of intact clonal fragments. Basal portions of clonal fragments severed when there were one or two rooted ramets in the apical portion produced more secondary ramet mass than <b>equivalent</b> <b>parts</b> of intact fragments. The gain in mass of secondary ramets in the basal portions of severed fragments matched the reduction in mass of secondary ramets in the apical portions. However, severing caused an overall loss of mass when apical portions had three or fewer rooted ramets at the time of severing, because the mass of primary ramets in basal portions did not increase following severing. Severing had little impact on the allometry of the apical portions. The relationship between mass in secondary ramets and mass in primary ramets was similar in the apical portions of severed and intact clonal fragments. None of the severing treatments increased the total mass of secondary ramets, suggesting that apical dominance in this species only affects branches very close to the apex. These observations, combined with existing knowledge of vascular architecture in G. hederacea, demonstrate that, whether or not physical connections persist between ramets, growing stolons rapidly develop into physiologically autonomous segments. This may be a characteristic of species that exploit disturbed, spatially heterogeneous habitats through rapid multiplication of ramets connected by long, aerial runners or stolons...|$|E
