40|$|During {{the fall}} of 2005 and spring of 2006, habitat {{assessments}} and rapid bioassessments were conducted at six sites on 100 m reaches on <b>Five</b> <b>Mile</b> Creek in Jefferson County, Alabama and two sites on neighboring rural streams that were used as references. Habitat scores and index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores for the fish communities were calculated for all sites. The IBI scores on <b>Five</b> <b>Mile</b> Creek did not compare well {{with one of the}} reference streams and suggest impairment. The habitat scores for the <b>Five</b> <b>Mile</b> Creek sites were similar to the scores of the reference streams. The IBI scores and habitat scores for the <b>Five</b> <b>Mile</b> Creek sites were not significantly correlated, suggesting that the impairment of the fish populations is due mainly to poor water quality. IBI scores were highest at the three downstream sites, furthest away from urbanization and industrialization. Land use data on the surrounding area of <b>Five</b> <b>Mile</b> Creek illustrated that there was a much higher proportion of the land designated as residential and industrial in the upper regions of the stream. This implies that urban and industrial pollution are the main sources of water quality impairment on <b>Five</b> <b>Mile</b> Creek. ...|$|R

5|$|As {{with local}} Tamils, the {{preferred}} marriage pattern {{is based on}} cross cousin preference. Parallel cousins are considered {{brothers and sisters and}} are ineligible as partners.

Within a village, most of the residents are related and this carries on over to villages that are three to <b>five</b> <b>miles</b> away as well. The longer the distance the more distantly are the villagers related to each other. Related lineages also maintain places of worship that are the private property of the family group.|$|E
