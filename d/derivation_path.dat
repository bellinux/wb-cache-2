Usual abduction in logic programming is used to complement unknown information and used in one <b>derivation</b> <b>path</b> in a search tree. We call this kind of abduction local abduction. In this paper, we propose another abduction which is used over paths in a search tree for search control. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to formalize a search control in a logical way. We discuss applications of global abduction by using examples; a formalization of don't-care nondeterminism and a formalization of reuse of the previously obtained result in a di#erent search path...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{semantics}} of LOTOS {{are defined}} in terms of axioms and inference rules which generate, from a given behaviour expression, the next possible actions and their resulting behaviour expressions. In this paper, we present a new type of inference rules, which are capable of generating traces of actions leading to a pre-selected action in the specification. These inference rules are guided by the static <b>derivation</b> <b>path</b> of the pre-selected action, which locates the action in the abstract syntactic tree of the current behaviour statically. This allows a considerable reduction of the search space. Such a technique often permits the analysis of divergent specifications that are generally beyond the capabilities of verification tools based on traces...|$|E

Provenance information is essential if experiments are to be validated and verified by others, or even by those who originally performed them. In this article, we give an overview of our initial work on the provenance of bioinformatics e-Science experiments within myGrid. We use two kinds of provenance: the <b>derivation</b> <b>path</b> of information and annotation.

40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of a LOTOS specification {{can be described}} as a tree, called behaviour tree, where the nodes represent the states of the behaviour, and the branches represent the possible next actions. Unfortunately, the behaviour tree for a realistic size LOTOS specification can be very large and often has no finite representation. This is the major limitation for the existing LOTOS verification techniques. The main goal of this thesis is to provide a new behaviour tree exploration technique, called Goal-Oriented Execution, {{that can be used to}} check properties of LOTOS specifications by narrowing exploration to a meaningfully selected subset of the tree. In this execution technique, the system derives traces (i. e paths in the behaviour tree) satisfying certain assertions that express temporal ordering of actions and data values properties. Goal-Oriented Execution is a combination of three techniques. The first technique is an automatically generated ADT evaluator/narrower engine. It is capable of evaluating an expression based on a rewriting rule approach, borrowed from functional programming, and deriving solutions to a set of constraints using a narrowing technique, borrowed from logic programming. The second technique is a static analyzer that determines where the given assertions are likely to hold, producing static information called static <b>derivation</b> <b>paths.</b> The third technique, called guided-inference system, involves a new type of inference rules that derive traces using static <b>derivation</b> <b>paths</b> to resolve most non-determinism. Implementation issues of this technique are also discussed, and examples of its usage are provided. The technique is now included in ELUDO, the University of Ottawa LOTOS interpreter...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is {{collection}} and storage of the provenance data in a Grid system. Provenance is defined as <b>derivation</b> <b>path</b> {{of a piece of}} data. Nowadays Grid systems are equipped with tools and components forming collaborative space for science, called virtual laboratories. These modern scientific environments allows for executing in silico experiments in such disciplines as biochemistry, astronomy or quantum physics. In each of those cases, scientists are highly interested in resem-blances between experiments and results, tracing data entities or attaching metadata to obtained results. All these requirements can be fulfilled by tracing, storing and querying provenance in the system. This thesis presents PROToS- provenance tracking system designed to meet specific requirements of the ViroLab virtual laboratory. It is based around semantic modelling of provenance and systemâ€™s data and motivated by the Semantic Grid vision. Apart from design and implementation of the PROToS, also integration in challenging envi-ronment of the ViroLab is presented...|$|E
40|$|Managing {{semantic}} heterogeneity is {{a complex}} task. One solution involves matching like terms to each other. We view Match as an operator that takes two graph-like structures (e. g., concept hierarchies or ontologies) and returns a mapping between the nodes of the graphs that correspond semantically to each other. State of the art matching systems (e. g., Cupid) perform well for many real world applications. However, matching systems may produce mappings {{that may not be}} intuitively obvious to human users. In order for users to trust the mappings (and thus use them), they need information about them. Users need access to the sources that were used to determine semantic correspondences between terms and potentially they need to understand how deductions are performed. In this paper we describe how matching systems can explain their answers using the Inference Web (IW) infrastructure. There, S-Match, asemantic matching system, produces proofs for mappings it has discovered. Using the IW browser, users may visualize different explanations including provenance information, the <b>derivation</b> <b>path</b> of the mappings, etc. Thus users can make informed decisions about them. ...|$|E

40|$|Two main {{aspects of}} Partial Evaluation for Prolog {{programs}} are considered: treatment of cuts {{and control of}} recursion. The analysis about cut is exhaustive: we consider occurrences of cut within both conjunctions and disjunctions. We show which restrictions are necessary to safely deal with cut in Partial Evaluation and which transformations are allowed. We define a set of conditions for compile-time execution and remotion of cuts. The safety of these conditions is formally proved. Some interesting results {{about the impact of}} mode inference techniques within this framework are finally drawn. As for control issues, we address a new approach to the problem of detecting infinite <b>derivation</b> <b>paths.</b> It is based on a theoretical characterization of non-termination and provides a general technique whose effectiveness does not depend on the structure of program domains. ...|$|R

In this paper we enrich the Structured Entity-Relationship Model with appropriate extensions for data warehousing design (e. g. derivation rules and schema aggregation) and adapt a commercial CASE toolset to support such extended conceptual modeling.

40|$|Recent {{approaches}} for protecting information in data outsourcing scenarios exploit the combined use of access control and cryptography. In this context, {{the number of}} keys to be distributed and managed by users can be maintained limited by using a public catalog of tokens that allow key derivation along a hierarchy. However, the public token catalog, by expressing the key derivation relationships, may leak information on the security policies (authorizations) enforced by the system, which the data owner may instead wish to maintain confidential. In this paper, we present an approach to protect {{the privacy of the}} tokens published in the public catalog. Consistently with the data outsourcing scenario, our solution exploits the use of cryptography, by adding an encryption layer to the catalog. A complicating issue in this respect is that this new encryption layer should follow a <b>derivation</b> <b>path</b> that is "reversed" with respect to the key derivation. Our approach solves this problem by combining cryptography and transitive closure information. The result is an efficient solution allowing token release and traversal of the key derivation structure only to those users authorized to access the underlying resources.

The provenance logs of workflow executions are recorded as RDF graphs.

The nature of bioinformatics data and services, however, makes this difficult.

The ability to overcome this problem means that the provenance of workflows in bioinformatics and other domains can be themselves exploited to enhance the practice of e-Science. ...|$|R

40|$|The numerals {{that exist}} in natural {{languages}} {{can be divided into}} different classes of numerals, of which the most common are cardinals, ordinals, fractionals, multiplicatives, approximatives, collectives and distributives. Often in studies on numerals, it is (implicitly) assumed that the numeral classes, if morphologically derived, are universally derived from cardinals, and the exceptions to this are overlooked or ignored. In this thesis the numeral classes are morphologically analysed in a sample of five structurally and genetically unrelated languages: Dutch, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Japanese and Adyghe. What patterns of derivation can be observed? And what can these patterns tell us about the morphology and meaning of numerals of different classes? The results do not support the â€˜naiveâ€™ picture. Ten non-typical <b>derivation</b> <b>paths</b> were attested. Four of them connect the fractional denominator and the ordinal numerals. Four others connect the multiplicative to cardinals, ordinals, approximatives and distributives respectively. Two of them connect the multiplicative and the fractional denominator. Cognitively, the numerals below 4 are processed by the Object Tracking System (OTS), and the numerals 5 and higher are processed by the Approximate Number System (ANS), according to Spelke (2011). Ordinal and fractional constructions in my sample seem to reflect this distinction: only the forms involving lower numerals have suppletive forms. It is also reflected in the numeric scope of the derivational rules for multiplicatives and collectives. My sample does not exhaust all derivational possibilities.
