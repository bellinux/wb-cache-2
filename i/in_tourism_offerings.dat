40|$|The {{value of}} tourism from a {{consumer}} perspective {{occurs when the}} tourist interacts with people, objects, and surroundings before, during and after an experience. However these encounters are not only important for the tourist's value of the experience but it also creates value for the service provider, other tourists, local residents and the destination as a whole. The value occurs in the co-creation, {{and an understanding of}} this co-creation of value is a key issue in order to develop theory on tourism experiences. The paper presents an example of how a conceptual grid proposed by Eide and Mossberg (2013) can be used to understand co-creation of value in tourism by referring to a case of destination development in Dunga beach, Kisumu, Kenya. The purpose is to understand different degrees of co-creation <b>in</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>offerings</b> and to give implications for how the grid {{can be used as a}} base for developing co-created experiences. The main implications are that the grid visualises the performance of tourism offerings in both a holistic and particular way. By these visualisations it is possible to study and analyse the present state of the tourist offerings as well as to elaborate on movements in the grid to enhance idea generation, which may result in new or improved co-created experiences. Using different types of interactions in the grids reveals for example that the roles of the guides are closely related to and differ depending on the degree of co-creation. In a fully co-created experience, the guides' roles are not only facilitators but as friends on an equal level of knowledge and performance. It also exposes that tourists' interactions with residents are important for mutual understanding, not least in developing countries such as Kenya, where it is seen as important to include local residents in tourism development, from planning to implementation...|$|E
40|$|Touring ‘blockbuster’ {{exhibitions}} (TBEs) {{are major}} international exhibitions that present collections {{of works of}} art, cultural objects, natural history or memorabilia. These exhibitions are of a limited duration, occur infrequently and attract local residents and tourists who travel specifically to view them. TBEs offer exciting experiences and may positively affect {{the profile of a}} host city. Although touring blockbuster exhibitions possess the attributes of special events, these exhibitions have received little attention in the event and tourism studies literature, or in the field of destination marketing. The primary research question this study addresses is: How do touring blockbuster exhibitions contribute to city tourism marketing? The growing importance of the creation and delivery of memorable experiences in tourism, and the increasing awareness of the long term effects that events have on a host city’s identity and image, underpin the research. An exploratory qualitative multiple case study was conducted in four cities: Auckland and Wellington in New Zealand, and Canberra and Melbourne in Australia. The chosen methodology allowed an investigation of TBEs within four diverse settings, enabled {{a deeper understanding of the}} processes within each case and was beneficial for drawing commonalities and variations across the cases. The Melbourne case proved to be the most advanced in terms of hosting of TBEs, while Auckland has yet to find ways to exploit the potential of these events. Policy planners in the capital cities support TBEs not only to attract tourists but are also guided by the rationale of being the centre of the nation and the country. The methods of data collection included qualitative interviewing and document analysis. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with city policy makers and cultural institutions that have hosted TBEs. The interviews helped to access the information pertinent to the ways city tourism and events authorities approach TBEs and utilise these exhibitions in city marketing. Documents were used to navigate the specifics of the contexts, define the questions for interviews and provide supplementary and corroborative data. Thematic analysis was applied to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the topic and address the research objectives. An integrative model is developed that reveals the ways TBEs can contribute to the experiential dimension of a city’s tourism offering, its tourism product mix, brand image and long term tourism marketing objectives. The findings demonstrate that TBEs can be valuable assets for city event planners and destination marketers. The brand stature of these events is remarkably powerful; they can provide enriching and engaging experiences for visitors. This research reconceptualises the TBE as a major city event. The results present an important contribution to the events and tourism literature in advancing understanding of the role TBEs can play <b>in</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>offerings,</b> city events agendas and the marketing of cities. The research offers a new perspective on the problematics of major city cultural events, such as high-profile international exhibitions, and reveals the dynamics that affect their hosting and legacy. Practical implications relate to the hosting of TBEs in a way that supports city identity and enhances city competitiveness...|$|E

A questionnaire technique was used to meet the {{objective of the}} study, in which the residents’ perceptions were measured on a five-point Likert scale. A total of 246 respondents were interviewed, with the findings proving that their perceptions about <b>tourism</b> <b>offerings</b> were generally negative. The results show that the highest perception score was for the item “the current tourism policy of Harare allows for the residents to engage <b>in</b> <b>tourism</b> activities” (2. 72), whereas the lowest perception score was for the item “I am happy with the current quality of <b>tourism</b> <b>offerings</b> <b>in</b> Harare” (1. 88).

This allows the researcher to obtain insight in relation to the status quo <b>in</b> the <b>tourism</b> product <b>offering,</b> whether registered or not with an affiliated body. These facts and feedback that relate to the small to medium business sector <b>in</b> <b>tourism</b> provide rich data for recommendations for a collaborative approach for a future sustainable development plan. In relation to the research both qualitative and quantitative analysis was carried out. Statistical analysis was also carried out using frequencies and percentages in order to examine trends among the participant’s responses. The launch of WAW by Tourism Ireland/Failte Ireland, offers a unique opportunity to Donegal. It may open the “flood gates”; allowing access to mainstream tourism, previously concentrated on the lower counties. The impact of the recession in Ireland and particularly the Northwest from 2008, has resulted in closure of many facilities; hotels, B&Bs and businesses in general. Regeneration <b>in</b> the <b>tourism</b> sector is imperative for Donegal to reach its potential, in terms of provision of services, employment and income. The introduction of the WAW is an inspiration for surrounding communities; a vision for a sustainable future. A review of the literature indicates that developing rural tourism and marketing through its stakeholders, Donegal will need to meet the emerging needs of independent travellers in terms of accommodation, activities, access natural resources, countryside and local culture. With the development of the Roadmap initiative “The WAW”, it is anticipated that the number of visitors will increase in Donegal. This will require additional accommodation and facilities.

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} {{has become the}} main objective of the policy agenda for many governments and a key principle that underpins the planning process in the UK. Likewise, the concept of sustainable tourism has been widely embraced by managers and planners of tourist destinations, as it provides a platform for different stakeholders <b>in</b> the <b>tourism</b> industry to interact and discuss the impacts of their activities. Yet, despite the attention this concept has received, there still seem to be many gaps {{in the understanding of}} sustainable tourism development, {{especially when it comes to}} its implementation. This process is considered particularly difficult due to the conflicting interests that exist between the main stakeholders involved <b>in</b> <b>tourism.</b> Nevertheless, it has been suggested that local authorities can bring together and facilitate the cooperation between all these stakeholders, and therefore can play an essential role in the sustainable development of <b>tourism</b> <b>in</b> a destination. However, when it comes to large cities, even though they are important tourist destinations and attract many visitors, the concept of sustainable <b>tourism</b> <b>in</b> urban environments has received little attention from researchers and policy makers. Therefore, this thesis aims to address in part the current gaps <b>in</b> <b>tourism</b> research by <b>offering</b> an insight into sustainable <b>tourism</b> planning <b>in</b> urban areas. Using a case study approach, it seeks to develop the current knowledge and understanding of whether local authorities in London have embraced and implemented strategies and measures to promote sustainable development of tourism. To achieve this, the research uses a comparative framework to examine how the London boroughs have integrated policies for sustainable tourism development into their main planning documents. This analysis is developed further through a discussion of the findings of an online survey conducted with representatives of the local authorities in London, and the results of semistructured interviews with representatives of public and private organisations involved <b>in</b> <b>tourism</b> development <b>in</b> the capital. The research found that even though most policy makers consider sustainable tourism important and recognise its benefits, only a small number of London boroughs promote its principles in their planning policy documents for tourism, and even fewer have put in place initiatives to implement strategies for sustainable tourism development. To help understand why this is the case, the study identifies drivers of success and constraints perceived by both, the survey participants and interview respondents, which influence the implementation of sustainable tourism policies at the local level. Considering these factors may help local authorities design and enact measures for sustainable <b>tourism</b> development <b>in</b> a destination...|$|R

Because {{of the many}} impacts that tourism can have, {{it is important to}} understand if museums, operating under the paradigm shift of the new museology, are attempting to take action to minimize the negative impacts of tourism and embrace responsible tourism. Through document evaluation of marketing material offered by institutions executing travel programs, types of potential participation <b>in</b> responsible <b>tourisms</b> were identified. Programs with specific mention of responsible planning, goals or outcomes were also highlighted. A secondary method, a survey, established the certain areas that these institutions are focusing on with regards to implementing responsible tourism. This research provided evidence that these institutions discuss responsible tourism behavior at different times with their tourists and some create the programs specifically to counteract negative impacts of tourism. Museums and like institutions are beginning to practice responsible <b>tourism</b> <b>in</b> various ways with their travel program, especially zoos and aquariums. However, the field, brokers, tourists and locals could benefit from a more direct and consistent approach to encouraging responsible tourism...|$|R
