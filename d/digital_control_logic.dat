40|$|We {{introduce}} an Impulse Radio Ultra-Wide Band (IR-UWB) {{radio transmission}} scheme for miniaturized biomed-ical applications {{based on a}} dynamic and adaptive voltage thresholding of surface Electro Myo Graphy (sEMG) signals. The amplified sEMG signal is compared to a DAC-generated threshold computed from the previous 1 -bit history by custom <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> running at 2 kHz clock and implementing an ad-hoc algorithm (Dynamic Average Threshold Crossing, D-ATC). The resulting events and the associated digitized voltage level can be both asynchronously radiated through IR-UWB. Analyzes show that the scheme is robust w. r. t. the sEMG signal variability and correlates by ~ 96 % with regard to raw muscle force information after signal is recomputed at the RX. This paper compares D-ATC with regard to a fixed threshold system and an Average Threshold Crossing (ATC) demonstrating improved robustness, and introduces the thresholding algorithm verified on a dataset of 190 sEMG recorded signals. The applied threshold resolution has been optimized to both minimize the size of transmitted data and to guarantee good correlation performance.

The pressure sensors built using this option consists of polysilicon diaphragm over active areas, together forming a capacitor whose capacitance depends on the deformation of the diaphragm by ambient pressure. The change in capacitance, {{which is on the}} order of a few hundred femtofarads over the full pressure range of the sensor, must be converted into an electrical output signal.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} the analysis and development of an integrated receiver front-end module for high gain active antenna systems at the K-band (20 GHz). In the design of conventional satellite receivers (such as reflector antennas), the system is usually specified by the gain/directivity, gain-to-temperature ratio (G/T) and radiation pattern requirements. The challenge in high gain active antenna systems development, in addition to beam-forming/beam-steering requirements, is to develop transmit/receive modules which will meet the power, noise and radiation pattern requirements of the conventional antenna. In order to guarantee an optimal design, {{it is important to be}} able to translate the specifications from the system level to the transistor level. The focus is on the development of a single-channel CMOS-based integrated receiver module. The G/T requirement is analysed to derive the noise figure and gain specifications for the low noise amplifier(LNA). An LNA design in 65 nm CMOS is demonstrated to achieve a 2. 6 dB noise figure and uses only 7 mW of DC power. The digital phased shifter specifications are studied. The generation of "quantization lobes" is analysed and used to estimate the number of bits based on side-lobe level requirements. The design of a 5 -bit digital phase shifter based on quadrature signal modulation and a unique <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> is presented and tested at 20 GHz.

40|$|Resistive-type sensors such as gas sensors {{are widely}} used to monitor the environment. In most resistive-type sensor applications, none or very simple signal {{processing}} circuits are used. In this work, we apply modem signal processing circuitry to the resistive-type gas sensors. We tailored the signal processing circuitry to the special nature of these SnO 2, based resistive-type sensors, with the eventual goal of integrating the signal processing circuitry and the CMOS compatible gas sensor on a single silicon chip. SnO 2, is a popular metal-oxide sensor used to detect combustible gases such as CO, H 2 and methane. The operation of the metal-oxide sensor {{is based on the}} decrease of resistance when these gases are introduced in the ambient atmosphere. The resistive sensor can be modelled as a gas sensitive variable resistor. Analysis shows that the resistance varies inversely with the square root of the partial pressure of the gas which gives Rsensor[proportional to] 1 [division slash][square root[gas]] A current-mode interface circuit for integrated resistive-type gas-sensor application, followed by signal processing circuits, is described. Analysis shows that current mode operation out performs other operation modes. The base-band resistive signal is first chopped to higher frequency to minimize the interference of flicker noise, converted to current and amplified. This configuration takes advantage of the property of Equation (l), to increase the dynamic range. After filtering, the chopped signal is demodulated back to base-band signal. Unlike conventional lockin amplifier technique that the AC signal is demodulated by only a single demodulator, two demodulators with 90 [spacing ring above] phase difference are used in the circuit to (1) increase base-band magnitude, (2) reduce ac component, (3) double the frequency of the ac fundamental and harmonics and (4) reduce noise caused by difference in phase. Measurement shows that AC harmonics interference over base-band signal ratio at output is reduced by two thirds. The circuit is realized with 1. 2 μm CMOS process. The use of switched-current technique in filter and phase shifter design requires only a single poly layer. Hence, it can be implemented on standard digital CMOS process, with other <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> <b>logic,</b> without extra cost of an analog process.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{the outcome of}} a thesis work done at Linköpings University, campus Norrköping. The thesis work was part of the {{development}} of a RF transceiver chip for implantable medical applications. The development was done in cooperation with Zarlink Semiconductor AB, located in Järfälla, Stockholm. The transceiver is divided into three main blocks, which are the wakeup block, the MAC block and the RF block. The wakeup block is always operating and is awaiting a wakeup request in the 2, 45 GHz ISM-band. The RF-block is operating in the 400 MHz ISM-band and is powered up after wakeup The MAC is the controller of the whole chip. All three blocks in the transceiver structure should be integrated on the same chip, using TSMC 0, 18 µm process design kit for CMOS (Mixed Signal /RF). The purpose of the thesis work was to develop the wakeup circuit for the transceiver. The main purpose was to develop the <b>digital</b> <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> in the circuitry, using RTL-coding (mainly VHDL) but the thesis work also included a system analysis of the whole wakeup block, including the front-end, for getting a better overview and understanding of the project. A complete data packet or protocol for the wakeup message on 2, 45 GHz, is defined in the report {{and is one of the}} results of the project. The packet was developed continuously during progress in the project. Once the data packet was defined the incoming RF stage could be investigated. The final proposal to a complete system design for the wakeup block in the RF transceiver is also one of the outcomes of the project. The front-end consists mainly of a LNA, a simple detector and a special decoder. Since the total power consumption on the wakeup block was set to 200 nA, this had to be taken under consideration continuously. There was an intention not to have an internal clock signal or oscillator available in the digital part (for keeping the power consumption down). The solution to this was a self-clocking method used on the incoming RF signal. A special decoder distinguishes the incoming RF signal concerning the burst lengths in time. The decoder consists of a RC net that is uploaded and then has an output of 1, if the burst length is long enough and vice versa. When it was decided to use a LNA in the front-end, it was found that it could not be active continuously, because of the requirements on low power consumption. The solution to this was to use a strobe signal for the complete front-end, which activates it. This strobe signal was extracted in the digital logic. The strobe signal has a specific duty cycle, depending on the time factors in the detector and in the decoder in the front-end. The total strobing time is in the implemented solution 250 µs every 0, 5 s. The digital implementation of the control logic in the wakeupblock was made in VHDL (source code) and Verilog (testbenches). The source code was synthesized against the component library for the process 0, 18 µm from TSMC, which is a mixed/signal and RF process. The netlist from the synthesizing was stored as a Verilog file and simulated together with the testbenches using the simulator Verilog-XL. The results from the simulations were examined and reviewed in the program Simvison from Cadence. The result was then verified during a pre-layout review together with colleagues at Zarlink Semiconductor AB. During the implementation phase a Design report was written continuously and then used for the pre-layout review.

One of the challenges is the efficient development of the <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> for the distributed control systems that are often used to control the manufacturing equipment in the industry. Formal methods are mathematical frameworks that might be useful for overcoming that challenge. The <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> is often developed using the IEC 61131 standard that is focused on programming languages for non-distributed control systems. However, the new IEC 61499 standard provides the communication support as well as the programming units, i. e. function blocks, that are aimed at the <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> development for the distributed control systems. In the thesis, it is shown that the unclear specification of the function block scheduling order in the IEC 61499 might result in the <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> not being portable across IEC 61499 implementations. Therefore, the block scheduling order has to be considered during the <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> development.

The contributions may help developers to concentrate on the high-level <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> since {{they may be able to}} use the formal methods to reduce the possible impact that the block scheduling orders, used in different IEC 61499 implementations, might have on the correctness of their <b>control</b> <b>logic.</b> Therefore, the developers may receive some benefits of the formal methods for the efficient development of the IEC 61499 <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> for the distributed control systems...|$|R

40|$|DE 102008035654 A 1 UPAB: 20090222 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} determining {{a change}} in a configuration of a system, and testing whether the changed configuration {{of the system is}} retrievably stored, where the configuration of system is associated with a proper configuration of <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> of the system. The configuration of <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> that is associated with the changed configuration of system is retrieved, if the changed configuration of system is stored for the system. The <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> is adjusted to the changed configuration of the system. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a computer program with a program code for executing a method for adjusting a <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> of a system. USE - Method for adjusting a <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> of a system e. g. materials handling equipment, transportation system, vehicle, or support system for elderly/disabled persons. ADVANTAGE - The method allows retrieval of the configuration of <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> that is associated with the changed configuration of system, if the changed configuration of system is stored for the system, and adjusts the <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> to the changed configuration of the system, thus enabling adding, removal or change of a unit of the system in a simple manner...|$|R

The link is preferably realized by variations in a physical parameter of the storage medium (101) that exhibit a modulation pattern representing a necessary parameter for obtaining access to the <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> data. Alternatively, the link is realized by an integrated circuit (201) on the storage medium (101) which contains the necessary parameter. The necessary parameter may comprise a decryption key or authentication data...|$|R
40|$|A {{design study}} of {{adaptive}} <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> suitable for implementation in modern airborne digital flight computers was conducted. Both explicit controllers which directly utilize parameter identification and implicit controllers {{which do not}} require identification were considered. Extensive analytical and simulation efforts resulted in the recommendation of two explicit digital adaptive flight controllers. Interface weighted least squares estimation procedures with <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> were developed using either optimal regulator theory or with <b>control</b> <b>logic</b> based upon single stage performance indices...|$|R
