25|$|Hidden {{headlamps}} (also {{known as}} pop-up lights) {{were introduced in}} 1936, on the Cord 810/812. They were mounted in the front fenders, which were smooth until the lights were cranked out - {{each with its own}} small <b>dash-mounted</b> crank - by the operator. They aided aerodynamics when the headlamps were not in use, and were among the Cord's signature design features.|$|E
25|$|The {{vehicle was}} the second mass-produced hybrid on the American market, after the two-seat Honda Insight. While the larger Prius could seat five, its battery pack {{restricted}} cargo space. The vehicle interior featured a <b>dash-mounted</b> shift lever, and a small touch screen with a hybrid powertrain display. This feature showed the vehicle operation regarding the interplay between gasoline engine, battery pack, and electric motors, and could also show a bar graph of fuel economy results.|$|E
5000|$|Radio models used {{in these}} systems {{included}} the names, [...] "Classic", [...] "Corona", [...] "Centura", generally referred to as 3C radios. While most radio models were sold with a speaker and microphone, some had a telephone handset and cradle attached {{to the front of}} the <b>dash-mount</b> radio housing. There was an earlier trunk-mount model that looked like a MASTR Executive II with the name Mastr. A MPR-series hand-held model was offered for GE Marc V trunked systems. Later models included a Japanese-made radio with model numbers beginning with TMX (mobiles) and TPX (portables). Certain later models of PCS and MDX radios were dual-mode, supporting GE Marc V and EDACS.|$|R
25|$|The $162 Super Sport {{package was}} {{available}} on the upscale Malibu two-door hardtop and convertible models; the option added special exterior brightwork with SS emblems and the 14-inch full-disc wheel covers from the Impala SS. Inside, the vinyl bucket-seat interior featured a floor console for models equipped with the optional Muncie aluminum four-speed-manual or Powerglide two-speed automatic instead of the standard three-speed manual. Malibu SS also came with a four-gauge cluster in place of engine warning lights, and a <b>dash-mounted</b> tachometer was optional. The available 283-cubic-inch four-barrel V8 engine rated at 220-horsepower was the same rating as the 1957 Chevy Power-Pak 283 engine.|$|E
2500|$|Shelby American started 2015 Shelby GT by {{incorporating}} {{a more aggressive}} style with carbon fiber enhancements: hood, rockers, splitters, spoiler and diffuser. Shelby GT also features cold air intakes, custom 20" [...] WELD Venice wheels with high-grip Michelin tires, Ford Performance supercharger, Wilwood brakes, adjustable rear control arms, <b>dash-mounted</b> 3-gauge pod for track boost, fuel & oil pressure, race seats, roll cage and harness.|$|E
2500|$|Entirely {{incorporated}} {{within the}} engine bay, the combined {{heating and cooling}} system had cold air for passengers enter through <b>dash-mounted</b> vents. Nash's exclusive [...] "remarkable advance" [...] {{was not only the}} [...] "sophisticated" [...] unified system, but also its US$345 price was significantly less than all the other systems. The optional air conditioning system offered by Oldsmobile cost $199 more and it weighed twice as much as the integrated Nash unit that added only [...]|$|E
2500|$|AMC {{broadened the}} car's market appeal by {{lowering}} the base price to US$2,601 (US$ in [...] dollars) and offering more options. For example: high-level trim packages {{that had previously been}} standard, as well optional floor or center console mounted 4-speed manual transmission and a <b>dash-mounted</b> tachometer, affected small changes in pricing and equipment that paralleled the competition. By comparison, Chrysler did a similar thing with the pricing and content of its Dodge Charger from the 1966 to the 1967 model years. Despite these changes, Marlin production fell to 4,547 in 1966.|$|E
2500|$|The E-body coupes were {{converted}} to unibody construction and further downsized for 1986, to a [...] wheelbase shared with the Buick Regal. The V6 was now the only engine, rated initially at [...] SAE and [...] of torque. It used the Turbo-Hydramatic 440-T4 automatic with a 2.84:1 final drive ratio. [...] This generation was noted for advanced electronic instrumentation displayed on a <b>dash-mounted</b> [...] CRT. The CRT controlled the vehicle's climate control system and stereo, and also supplied advanced instrumentation such as a trip computer and maintenance reminder feature. Four-wheel disc brakes were standard. With a choice of three suspension packages available, up to the performance oriented FE3 setting, handling was notably improved. The Riviera placed fourth for Motor Trends 1986 Car of the Year contest.|$|E

50|$|Virtual Reality Heads-up Display : Rather than <b>dash-mounted</b> CRT displays, the Knight 4000 uses {{a virtual}} reality heads-up display {{employing}} the entire windshield as video monitor.|$|E
50|$|The {{system used}} a <b>dash-mounted</b> {{push button control}} panel where the driver could select forward or reverse and a {{governor}} that sensed vehicle speed and throttle position.|$|E
50|$|By 1927 {{the company}} was {{offering}} a wide variety, but the motometer became soon obsolete when <b>dash-mounted</b> temperature gauges appeared around 1930. Boyce had such a device patented as early as 1917.|$|E
50|$|Track Condition Radio - helps alert {{drivers with}} {{critical}} information by transmitting messages from race {{control to the}} racecar. A <b>dash-mounted</b> display communicates messages including safety warnings, track condition and pits opened/closed.|$|E
50|$|Two {{transmissions}} were offered: a three-speed manual with optional overdrive and Chrysler's two-speed PowerFlite automatic. The PowerFlite {{was controlled}} by a <b>dash-mounted</b> lever, though this was changed to a push-button setup for 1956.|$|E

5000|$|The basic [...] "Custom" [...] {{model was}} {{eliminated}} for 1983, {{and a new}} Select-Trac system became standard equipment. A <b>dash-mounted</b> control allowed the driver to change between two- and four-wheel drive. The switch activated a vacuum-activated spline clutch that was built into the front axle assembly.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the Mark VII and VIII predecessors, the Borg Warner DG {{automatic}} gearbox started in first gear {{and had a}} <b>dash-mounted</b> switch to allow second gear to be held indefinitely. Once in third gear, a series of clutches engaged to allow direct drive rather than through the torque converter.|$|E
50|$|While the {{equivalent}} U.S. Market Chevy Nova featured changes in safety and emissions equipment during its relatively short 1968-1974 run (it {{had a total}} restyle for 1975), the Argentina version retained the 1968 car's features throughout its entire run, including a <b>dash-mounted</b> ignition switch and smaller side marker lights.|$|E
50|$|The 2010 RX Remote Touch system {{operates}} {{in conjunction with}} a 228 mm forward <b>dash-mounted</b> display, along with organic light-emitting diode (OLED) instrument cluster and optional white LED heads-up display (HUD), while the 2010 HS Remote Touch system uses a 228 mm pop-up navigation screen along with the OLED display and optional HUD.|$|E
50|$|The Chevrolet Express is {{a concept}} car created in 1987 by Chevrolet. The car {{featured}} a roof which opened to allow entry, ran on a gas turbine engine, was capable of 150 miles per hour, and was made of carbon fiber. The car had drive-by-wire controls, instrumentation and three <b>dash-mounted</b> screens, and cameras replacing mirrors.|$|E
5000|$|The V8 engine came to Chrysler of Canada's low-priced {{models in}} 1955. [...] The engines were {{imported}} from Detroit with various covers, manifolds, electrical pieces and rubber parts added in Windsor. Only the Mayfair offered the V8. And both Plymouth and Dodge offered PowerFlite, 2-speed automatic {{with its new}} <b>dash-mounted</b> control lever. The Hy-Drive unit was eliminated.|$|E

50|$|As {{well as a}} full body, the {{standard}} Leader features included a headlight trimmer, an extendable lifting handle for easy centrestand use, and a permanent windscreen mounting. Factory listed options included: integrated-design hard-luggage 'panniers', the first flashing indicators on a British motorcycle, a <b>dash-mounted</b> parking light, windscreen top-extension (adjustable on the move), a rear rack and a clock aperture built into a 'dashboard' (closed-off by an Ariel badge when not fitted).|$|E
50|$|The fuel {{sending unit}} {{assembly}} {{may be a}} combination of the electric fuel pump, the filter, the strainer, and the electronic device used to measure the amount of fuel in the tank via a float attached to a sensor which sends data to the <b>dash-mounted</b> fuel gauge. The fuel pump by itself is a relatively inexpensive part. But a mechanic at a garage might have a preference to install the entire unit assembly.|$|E

50|$|Since its beginnings, the Georgia State Patrol {{has been}} one of the leading law {{enforcement}} agencies in the country with regards to new technology and innovations. Georgia State Patrol was the first agency to equip all of its patrol cars with <b>dash-mounted</b> cameras. Each trooper on patrol in Georgia has specialized training in the Pursuit Immobilization Technique (P.I.T.). This method allows Troopers to end pursuits quickly by putting the fleeing vehicle in a controlled spin.|$|E

50|$|In 2001 GM {{announced}} that the Eldorado's 50th model year (2002) would be its last. To {{mark the end of}} the nameplate, a limited production run of 1,596 cars in red or white—the colors available on the original 1953 convertible—were produced in three batches of 532, signifying the Eldorado's first year of production. These last cars featured specially tuned exhaust notes imitating their forerunners from a half-century earlier, and a <b>dash-mounted</b> plaque indicating each car's sequence in production.|$|E
50|$|A {{power antenna}} is an {{electrically}} motorized automotive radio antenna that raises and lowers either manually with a <b>dash-mounted</b> switch or automatically {{by turning the}} radio on or off. The automatic kind will also lower when the ignition switch is turned off. Unlike most car antennas adjusted directly by hand, power antennas retract completely beneath the surface that they are mounted on. This convenience appeared on luxury cars {{as early as the}} mid-1950s. The automatic power antenna first appeared in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Things {{changed in}} 1956 when Chrysler of Canada {{opened a new}} V8 engine plant. The Mayfair was now V8 only, while the lower-priced Dodge Crusader and Dodge Regent could be had with either the six or V8.
