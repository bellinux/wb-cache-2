500|$|In 1803, Ezra <b>I</b> <b>earned</b> the nickname, [...] "King Caesar", {{partly due}} to his ambitious character, but also due to his victory in a local {{political}} conflict that year involving {{the construction of the}} first Bluefish River Bridge in Duxbury. Ezra I succeeded in pushing the expensive project through town meeting, much to the consternation of his opponents. When Ezra I died in 1822, the nickname passed to Ezra Weston II.|$|E
500|$|In 1917, Jolin {{rented a}} studio at Kungsbroplan in Stockholm and painted diligently. At {{the end of}} that year he was visited by Herman Gotthardt, a {{wholesaler}} from Malmö, who had recently taken up art collecting as a hobby. He studied Jolin's numerous works and, as at this time the artists sold very few paintings, it came as a surprise to him when Gotthardt bought 16 canvases. Jolin received seven thousand crowns (sek) for the paintings, and at home the same evening he was able to show his parents the money from his first major sales, saying: [...] "Look here, this is what <b>I</b> <b>earned</b> today".|$|E

500|$|Walters re-signed {{with the}} Eagles before {{training}} camp in 1983. He played in the first preseason game against the Detroit Lions, but {{had to leave the}} game due to an injury. Three days later, on August 8, he announced his retirement from football, saying [...] "After 12 years of playing in the NFL, <b>I</b> <b>earned</b> the right to go to my head coach and just say I've fought my battle. It's over." [...] However, when his replacement, Dean Miraldi, suffered a sprained knee in the next preseason game, Walters ended his week-long retirement to re-join the Eagles on August 15. The contract offered to him included a clause that the organization would put up a barn next to his house. He re-injured his knee against the St. Louis Cardinals on September 25 and had to leave the game. Before the November 20 game against the New York Giants, Walters was benched, along with four other starters, by head coach Marion Campbell in an attempt to rejuvenate the team with younger players after five straight losses. He finished the season with ten starts in twelve games. He ended a streak of 122 consecutive starts at left tackle for the Eagles during the 1983 season.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{academic}} {{administrators have}} discussed the correlation between economics, college choice, and the rankings. David McGrath, emeritus professor of English, College of DuPage, discussed his own decision to attend Chicago State University in the 24 July 2007 Chicago Tribune article, Ode to a fourth-tier college. Of this decision, he noted that, [...] "I qualified for admission elsewhere, but CSU was close to my part-time job, and it was cheap [...] I never required a student loan since <b>I</b> <b>earned</b> enough as a grocery bagger to pay tuition and fees in 1970 that totaled $300 per year. All told, a pretty good value, even for a fourth-tier school." [...] McGrath considered it a [...] "good value," [...] because, [...] "CSU eventually led to a teaching career, and my working alongside professors from Princeton, Northwestern, and the University of Chicago. <b>I</b> <b>earned</b> the same ample salary and benefits as they, and, more important, was privileged {{to engage in the}} same kind of fulfilling work." [...] He also referenced the 2000 Krueger-Dale study (which compared groups of students who received the same SAT scores, attended both high and low-income schools, and found no difference in post-graduation success rates [...] ) and noted that, [...] "too often, it seems, students choose colleges the way they choose jeans or athletic shoes. They would rather bust the family budget than be caught dead in sweats bearing an unrecognizable school logo. But it's their ability, work ethic and dedication that determine the height of their achievement." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull led to speculation that LaBeouf {{will take over}} the franchise from Ford. In an interview with IGN, [...] "Spielberg indicated that LaBeouf has to make multiple Transformers movies before he can move over and take on the fedora and bullwhip of Indiana Jones." [...] The actor himself said, [...] "Am I into it? Who wouldn't be? I don't think that's reality. It's a fun rumor." [...] Ford said he would return for a fifth film {{if it does not}} take another twenty years to develop, while Spielberg responded it would happen [...] "only if you [...] want more". [...] In an interview with Time, when asked about passing the fedora to LaBeouf in the next film, Ford said, [...] "What are you talking about? It's mine. I would love to do another Indiana Jones movie. George Lucas is working on an idea now. Shia can get his own hat. <b>I</b> <b>earned</b> that hat." ...|$|E

2500|$|In fact, {{for playing}} {{a major role}} in repulsing the Western Chalukyas under Someshvara I, whose son Vikramaditya VI and Someshvara II were leading the Chalukyas, Kulottunga <b>I</b> <b>earned</b> the title 'Viruduraja Bhayankara' meaning the 'reason for the {{frightening}} of Viruduraja (Vikramaditya VI), the Chalukyan prince. For most of his rule, he succeeded in keeping up the successes of the Cholas over the Chalukyas. There was only the temporary loss of Vengi in 1118 to Vikramaditya VI when Kulottunga I was unwell and recalled his third son Vikrama Chola, a favourite of his, for appointing him as heir to the Chola throne. [...] When Vikrama Chola left for Gangaikonda Cholapuram from Vengi, of which part he was the ruler under Kulottunga I, the Chalukyan armies invaded Vengi, taking advantage of the Cholas being busy with the coronation preparations of Vikrama Chola and for about 4 years, Vengi passed to the Chalukyas. [...] However, Vikrama Chola, after succeeding father Kulottunga I, swiftly consolidated his position and he too was benefited because by 1125–26 Chalukya Vikramaditya VI himself was old, ailing and close to death.|$|E
