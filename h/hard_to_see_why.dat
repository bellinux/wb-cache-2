40|$|An {{attack on}} the unions won’t {{necessarily}} have the expected political impact. FOR BOTH sides of Australian politics, the 1980 s has assumed {{the status of a}} heroic age. Among Labor figures, this is hardly surprising, since the era was marked by a string of election victories, significant policy innovation and economic transformation, led by two charismatic personalities – Bob Hawke and Paul Keating – and supported by many talented ministers. For the Liberals and Nationals, it is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> the period should be celebrated, except as a magnanimous tribute to the past achievements of their opponents, which they can then, not so magnanimously, contrast with Labor’s recent performance. But not so, for the conservatives have come to regard the 1980 s as the happy era in which they waged war on the “Industrial Relations Club. ” The term is Gerard Henderson’s, from a 1983 essay in Quadrant in which he claimed that employer groups, unions, the federal industrial relations department and the Arbitration Commission formed a largely Melbourne-based club that controlled Australian industrial relations. The individuals running these organisations, he wrote, had a “vested interest” in an IR system based on pragmatic deal-making between contending parties. They acted without regard for the economic effects of their decisions, or for the national interest more generally. In a recent speech to the Sydney Institute, employment minister Eric Abetz compared Henderson (who now presides over that very institute) to Martin Luther nailing his Ninety-Five Theses to the church door in Wittenberg five centuries ago. Abetz claimed that Henderson, like Luther, caused reverberations that led to a “Thirty Years War. ” (The real Thirty Years War actually broke out a century after Luther’s famous protest, but things presumably moved at a slower pace in those days.) … Read the full articl...|$|R
2500|$|While Schiller felt greatly {{indebted to}} the pragmatism of William James, Schiller was {{outright}} hostile to the pragmatism of C.S. Peirce. Both Schiller and James struggled with what Peirce intended with his pragmatism, and both were often baffled by Peirce's insistent rebuffing of what they both saw as the natural elaboration of the pragmatist cornerstone he himself first laid down. On {{the basis of his}} misunderstandings, Schiller complains that for Peirce to merely say [...] "'truths should have practical consequences'" [...] is to be [...] "very vague, and hints at no reason for the curious connexion it asserts." [...] Schiller goes on to denigrate Peirce's principle as nothing more than a simple truism [...] "which hardly deserves a permanent place and name in philosophic usage". After all, Schiller points out, [...] "t is <b>hard</b> [...] <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> even the extremest intellectualism should deny that the difference between the truth and the falsehood of an assertion must show itself in some visible way." ...|$|R
60|$|Lighting his pipe, George leaned contentedly on the rail. Then {{remembering what}} the Canadian had said, {{he thought of}} his old friend Marston, a man of charm and varied talents, whom he had long admired and often rather humbly {{referred}} <b>to.</b> It was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> understand how Dick had failed in Canada, and <b>harder</b> still <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> he had made his plodding comrade his executor; for George, having seldom had occasion to exert his abilities, had no great belief in them. He had suffered keenly when Sylvia married Dick, but the homage he had offered her had always been characterized by diffidence, springing from a doubt that she could be content with him; and after a sharp struggle he succeeded in convincing himself that his wound did not matter if she were happier with the more brilliant man. He had entertained no hard thoughts of her: Sylvia could do no wrong. His love for her sprang rather from respect than passion; in his eyes she was all that a woman ought to be.|$|R

500|$|In 1968, Wright {{commented on}} Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: [...] "It's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> we were {{cast as the}} first British {{psychedelic}} group. We never saw ourselves that way... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted... the emphasis... firmly on spontaneity and improvisation." [...] Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: [...] "There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all {{so we had to}} do something stupid and 'experimental'...Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't {{want to go back to}} playing [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] for hours and hours." [...] Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|Alan Baker broadly agrees, stating, [...] "There is no {{evidence}} that this was common practice among gladiators. As far as we know, the only time this phrase was used was at an event staged by Claudius." [...] Plass notes that [...] "it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> or how the phrase came to be used on this occasion if it was not a regular formula. On the other hand, if it was something that Claudius might expect to hear it would more naturally serve in its role as a feed line for his repartee portraying his invincible gaucherie." [...] He comments on the distancing effect of the Latin source and the first person of the Greek source and notes that the interpretation and response by the fighters [...] "seems to be a maneuver within rules governing clemency in the arena".|$|E
500|$|The {{reviewer}} for Time {{acknowledged the}} critical storm around Fleming and Dr. No, but was broadly welcoming of the book, writing that while [...] "not all readers will agree that Dr. No... is magnificent writing,... pages of it, at least, qualify for Ezra Pound's classic comment on Tropic of Cancer: 'At last, an unprintable {{book that is}} readable'." [...] In The New York Times, Anthony Boucher—described by Fleming's biographer John Pearson as [...] "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—was again damning of Fleming's work, saying [...] "it's <b>harder</b> than ever <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> an ardent coterie so admires Ian Fleming's tales". Benson described Boucher's critique as [...] "true to form" [...] and [...] "a tirade" [...] as Boucher concluded his review by saying: [...] "it is 80,000 words long, with enough plot for 8,000 and enough originality for 800." ...|$|R
40|$|Thomas(1) {{and later}} Fermi(2) have {{attempted}} to determine the time average electrical potential around the nucleus of a heavy atom. They treat the electrons as if they formed an ideal degenerate Fermi gas which becomes statistically distributed in the steady field due to the nucleus plus the locally rapidly fluctuating field due to the electrons themselves. This method is apparently fully justified and it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> at first, <b>why</b> the numerical solutions given by the above writers {{turn out to be}} so roughly approximate, especially for heavy atoms with many electrons. The following investigation purports to show that the roughness of the method is due to the unjustified, except for approximation purposes, use of the statistical distribution law of an ideal gas in a steady field in the case where the field is steady only when averaged over a sufficiently long time interval and is locally fluctuating...|$|R

500|$|Kennet Allott, in {{defending}} against any possible harsh criticism of [...] "Ode to Psyche", {{argues that the}} poem [...] "is the Cinderella of Keats's great odes, but it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> it should be so neglected, {{and at least two}} poets imply that the conventional treatment of the poem is shabby and undeserved". Allott then cites Bridges and Eliot as views that he sympathizes with, and he believes that the poem [...] "is neither unflawed nor the best of odes, but to me it illustrates better than any other Keats's possession of poetic power in conjunction with what was for him an unusual artistic detachment, besides being a remarkable poem in its own right. This may be another way of saying that it is the most architectural of the odes, as it is certainly the one that culminates most dramatically." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Ryce of Resident Advisor gave [...] "Harlem Shake" [...] {{a rating}} of three-and-a-half out of five and found its musical climax [...] "admittedly satisfying—that is, until it resumes {{flailing}} like a novelty track", writing that [...] "it's not <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> the track is well-liked, but its snowballing ubiquity {{is a bit of}} a head-scratcher, simply because it's not all that interesting." [...] Similarly, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said that, after hearing a minute of it being played during Power 105.1 FM's mixshow, the song [...] "felt more like a novelty than like part of a strategy." [...] Caramanica felt that its success, along with that of Macklemore's 2012 song [...] "Thrift Shop", reflects a [...] "centerless future" [...] for hip hop and stated, [...] "Depending on your lens, this reflects a tremendous cultural victory for hip-hop or the moment when hip-hop, as a construct, begins to lose meaning." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amichai {{poetry in}} English {{appeared}} in {{the first issue of}} [...] "Modern Poetry in translation" [...] edited by Daniel Weissbort and Ted Hughes in 1965. In 1966 he appeared at the Spoleto poetry festival with Ezra Pound, W.H. Auden, Pablo Neruda and others. In 1968, he appeared at the London Poetry Festival. His first book in English, Selected Poems (1968), was translated by Assia Guttman, (Hughes' lover and mother to his daughter Shura). Referring to him as [...] "the great Israeli poet," [...] Jonathan Wilson wrote in The New York Times that he [...] "is one of very few contemporary poets to have reached a broad cross-section without compromising his art. He was loved by his readers worldwide...perhaps only as the Russians loved their poets {{in the early part of}} the last century. It is not <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>why.</b> Amichai's poems are easy on the surface and yet profound: humorous, ironic and yet full of passion, secular but God-engaged, allusive but accessible, charged with metaphor and yet remarkably concrete. Most of all, they are, like the speaking persona in his Letter of Recommendation, full of love: Oh, touch me, touch me, you good woman! / This is not a scar you feel under my shirt. / It is a letter of recommendation, folded, / from my father: / 'He is still a good boy and full of love.'
