40|$|Main goal of {{this work}} is the {{analysis}} of the interaction of participants of freight forwarding activities. Research methods included analysis of scientific literature, theory of systems and systems analysis, methods of induction and deduction. As sources of information used and applied work of fundamental importance known foreign and local scientists and regulatory and legislative documents of Ukraine for the state transport policy. In the article the basic interactions of participants of freight forwarding activities. Classified components freight forwarding services. Assign the concept freight forwarding system and its aim. Established element and forms of cooperation in the freight forwarding system. The main task of forwarding companies are organizing, coordinating and ensuring the <b>delivery</b> from shipper <b>to</b> <b>consignee.</b> Freight forwarding company responsible for the timely delivery of the goods on the condition of preservation of the quantity and quality specified time conditions. Currently used methods are uneffective decision-making, leading to losses. These circumstances require improvement methodology management of freight forwarding companies. This is possible only using modern mathematical methods and information technologies that will improve the operation of freight forwarding companies. The article presents a theoretical exposition of the basic processes of interaction between participants in freight forwarding system. The article may be of interest to specialists of freight forwarding companies...|$|R

In every colony except Massachusetts, protesters were able to force the tea <b>consignees</b> <b>to</b> resign or to return the tea to England.

40|$|A yard in a {{container}} terminal is a temporary storage space before containers are loaded onto the target vessel or de-livered <b>to</b> <b>consignees.</b> For improving the utilization of the space {{in the yard and}} the efficiency of loading and discharg-ing operations, it is important that operation plans must be carefully constructed in advance. A heuristic method is suggested to solve operation space planning problems considering workloads on handling equipment as well as space availabilities. The operation plans in this paper includes quay crane (QC) schedules and space plans for multiple ves-sels considering the workload in the container yard of container terminals. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a space planning method and the performance of a new QC scheduling method using a simulation model...|$|R

40|$|Everybody {{agrees that}} {{containers}} are a "good thing";the actual advantages of transporting cargo, and in particular, dry cargo, in containers over {{other forms of}} transport have, to our knowledge, nowhere been stated in quantitative terms. It is claimed that containers will reduce the turn-round time of ships, ease congestion in the docks, speed-up total transit time of cargo, {{reduce the risk of}} pilferage, reduce packaging cost and reduce total handling effort in all stages of transit. Given that all these advantages are real, it is obvious that they do not accrue in equal measure to all parties concerned in the movement of goods from consignor <b>to</b> <b>consignee.</b> There is indeed a likelihood of a conflict of interest between these parties. In this report we shall try to delineate the various problem areas, indicate the quantitative information that needs to be collected in order to decide how to solve these problems and outline an approach to such solutions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a normative model for efficient goods movement promoting supply chain integration in developing economies. Supply chains encompass a holistic throughput of goods movements {{to and from}} partner organisations including internal and external suppliers. Similarly, multimodal freight transport re{{presents a}}n integrated system for moving goods quickly and inexpensively from shipper <b>to</b> <b>consignee</b> by at least two different modes under a single contract. The initial discussion considers the influence of containerisation on international freight transport and some benefits and limitations of multimodalism. A trend towards supply chain integration and the implications for intermediaries and shippers or manufacturers in freight transport systems are discussed. Various barriers to supply chain integration in developing economies are presented. A case study of the scope for developing multimodal transport is reviewed {{in the light of}} particular national transport problems facing Bangladesh. Conclusions note the potential for multimodal freight transport to provide a catalyst for removing trade barriers and offer a model for achieving supply chain integration in such economies.

5000|$|A {{straight}} {{bill of lading}} by land or sea, or {{air waybill}} are not documents of title to the goods they represent. They do no more than require delivery of the goods <b>to</b> the named <b>consignee</b> and (subject <b>to</b> the shipper's ability to redirect the goods) to no other. This differs from an [...] "order" [...] or [...] "bearer" [...] bill of lading which are possessory title documents and negotiable, i.e. they can be endorsed and so transfer the right <b>to</b> take <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> the last endorsee. This aspect of shipping law is regulated by the Hague Rules, and the laws of individual countries, e.g. the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 and the U.S. Pomerene Act 1916. There is some international dispute as <b>to</b> whether the <b>consignee</b> on a straight bill must produce the bill in order <b>to</b> take <b>delivery.</b> The U.S. position is that the person taking delivery must prove his or her identity but, as in Hong Kong, {{there is no need to}} present the bill itself. In the UK there are conflicting obiter dicta in [...] "The Rafaela S" [...] 2003 2 Lloyd's Rep. 113 and [...] "The Happy Ranger" [...] 2002 2 AER (Comm) 23, so the matter must remain unclear even though there are serious problems, for example, arising from the everyday occurrence of cargo being discharged against letters of indemnity when original bills of lading are not yet available to be presented at the discharge port.|$|R
