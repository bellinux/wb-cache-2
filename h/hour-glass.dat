2500|$|When the {{frock coat}} was first worn, correct daytime full dress was a dress coat. The frock coat {{began as a}} form of undress, the {{clothing}} worn instead of the dress coat in more informal situations. [...] The coat itself was possibly of military origin. [...] Towards the end of the 1820s, it started to be cut with a waist seam to make it more fitted, with an often marked waist suppression and exaggerated flair of the skirt. This <b>hour-glass</b> figure persisted into the 1840s. As the frock coat became more widely established around the 1850s, it started to become accepted as formal day time full dress, thus relegating the dress coat exclusively to evening full dress, where it remains today as a component of white tie. At this period, the frock coat became the most standard form of coat for formal day time dress. Through most of the Victorian era it continued to be worn in similar situations those in which the lounge suit is worn today such as in weddings, funerals, and by professionals. It was the standard business attire of the Victorian era.|$|E
2500|$|The Crow People {{are well}} known for their intercut beadwork.

The Crow are an innovative people and are credited with developing their own style of stitch-work for adhering beads. [...] This stitch, which is contemporarily called the over-lay, is still also known as the [...] "Crow Stitch". In their beadwork, geometric shapes were primarily used with triangles, diamonds and <b>hour-glass</b> structures being the most prevalent.

Originally men's knowledge of weights and forces {{was in the same}} condition as their knowledge of smells and tastes is now--a knowledge not extending beyond that given by the unaided sensations; and it remained so until weighing instruments and dynamometers were invented. Before there were <b>hour-glasses</b> and clepsydras, most phenomena could be estimated as to their durations and intervals, with no greater precision than degrees of hardness can be estimated by the fingers. Until a thermometric scale was contrived, men's judgments respecting relative amounts of heat stood on the same footing with their present judgments respecting relative amounts of sound. And as in these initial stages, with no aids to observation, only the roughest comparisons of cases could be made, and only the most marked differences perceived; it is obvious that only the most simple laws of dependence could be ascertained--only those laws which, being uncomplicated with others, and not disturbed in their manifestations, required no niceties of observation to disentangle them. Whence it appears not only that in proportion as knowledge becomes quantitative do its previsions become complete as well as certain, but that until its assumption of a quantitative character it is necessarily confined to the most elementary relations.|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} the present thesis is the {{implementation}} of nonlinear isochoric-volumetric decoupled material laws into large deformation finite elements. With restriction to the isothermal isotropic case the material behaviour is described for elasticity, elastoplasticity and elastoviscoplasticity. The finite elements considered are three-dimensional solids and so-called 'solid-shell' elements of low order. The {{focus is on the}} application of the derived material laws to elements with selective reduced integration of the volumetric terms. In the case of nearly incompressible materials these elements lead to a significant reduction of the volumetric locking behaviour in combination with a simple and efficient implementation. The kernel of the method is the additive split of the stress tensor and the tangent moduli tensor in deviatoric and volumetric parts. Starting point of the split is an isochoric-volumetric decoupled energy function and a yield condition of the deviatoric type. By means of examples the selectively reduced integrated element is compared with alternative formulations including a modified volumetric part of the deformation gradient or independent internal dilatation and pressure variables. The numerical results are nearly identical. However, all of the described elements can lead to <b>hour-glassing,</b> which can be easily removed by modification of the selective reduced integration rule. The method developed in this work can be used for the numerical treatment of large plastic deformations of metals (e. g. metalforming). The method is not suitable to materials with pressure-dependent yield condition (e. g. geomaterials). (orig.)

60|$|In my {{walks through}} the burial-ground of Edgartown,--where the dead have lain so long that the soil, once enriched by their decay, has {{returned}} to its original barrenness,--in that ancient burial-ground I noticed much variety of monumental sculpture. The elder stones, dated a century back, or more, have borders elaborately carved with flowers, and are adorned with a multiplicity of death's-heads, cross-bones, scythes, <b>hour-glasses,</b> and other lugubrious emblems of mortality, with {{here and there a}} winged cherub to direct the mourner's spirit upward. These productions of Gothic taste must have been quite beyond the colonial skill of the day, and were probably carved in London, and brought across the ocean to commemorate the defunct worthies of this lonely isle. The more recent monuments are mere slabs of slate, in the ordinary style, without any superfluous flourishes to set off the bald inscriptions. But others--and those far the most impressive, both to my taste and feelings--were roughly hewn from the gray rocks of the island, evidently by the unskilled hands of surviving friends and relatives. On some there were merely the initials of a name; some were inscribed with misspelt prose or rhyme, in deep letters, which the moss and wintry rain of many years {{had not been able to}} obliterate. These, these were graves where loved ones slept! It is an old theme of satire, the falsehood and vanity of monumental eulogies; but when affection and sorrow grave the letters with their own painful labor, then we may be sure that they copy from the record on their hearts.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Such are {{the results}} of education,’ thought I as I passed beside them and came fairly among the tombs. Here, at least, there were no commonplace politics, no diluted this-morning’s leader, to {{distract}} or offend me. The old shabby church showed, as usual, its quaint extent of roofage and the relievo skeleton on one gable, still blackened with the fire of thirty years ago. A chill dank mist lay over all. The Old Greyfriars’ churchyard was in perfection that morning, and one could go round and reckon up the associations with no fear of vulgar interruption. On this stone the Covenant was signed. In that vault, as the story goes, John Knox took hiding in some Reformation broil. From that window Burke the murderer looked out many a time across the tombs, and perhaps o’ nights let himself down over the sill to rob some new-made grave. Certainly {{he would have a}} selection here. The very walks have been carried over forgotten resting-places; and the whole ground is uneven, because (as I was once quaintly told) ‘when the wood rots it stands to reason the soil should fall in,’ which, from the law of gravitation, is certainly beyond denial. But it is round the boundary that there are the finest tombs. The whole irregular space is, as it were, fringed with quaint old monuments, rich in death’s-heads and scythes and <b>hour-glasses,</b> and doubly rich in pious epitaphs and Latin mottoes—rich in them {{to such an extent that}} their proper space has run over, and they have crawled end-long up the shafts of columns and ensconced themselves in all sorts of odd corners among the sculpture. These tombs raise their backs against the rabble of squalid dwelling-houses, and every here and there a clothes-pole projects between two monuments its fluttering trophy of white and yellow and red. With a grim irony they recall the banners in the Invalides, banners as appropriate perhaps over the sepulchres of tailors and weavers as these others above the dust of armies. Why they put things out to dry on that particular morning it was hard to imagine. The grass was grey with drops of rain, the headstones black with moisture. Yet, in despite of weather and common sense, there they hung between the tombs; and beyond them I could see through open windows into miserable rooms where whole families were born and fed, and slept and died. At one a girl sat singing merrily with her back to the graveyard; and from another came the shrill tones of a scolding woman. Every here and there was a town garden full of sickly flowers, or a pile of crockery inside upon the window-seat. But you do not grasp the full connection between these houses of the dead and the living, the unnatural marriage of stately sepulchres and squalid houses, till, lower down, where the road has sunk far below the surface of the cemetery, and the very roofs are scarcely on a level with its wall, you observe that a proprietor has taken advantage of a tall monument and trained a chimney-stack against its back. It startles you to see the red, modern pots peering over the shoulder of the tomb.|$|R
