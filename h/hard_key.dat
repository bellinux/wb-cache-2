50|$|A softkey or {{soft key}} is a button {{flexibly}} programmable to invoke {{any of a}} number of functions rather than being associated with a single fixed function or a fixed set of functions. A softkey is often located alongside a display device of a portable device such as a cellular phone, where the button invokes a function described by the text at that moment shown adjacent to the button on the display. However, softkeys are also found away from the display device, for example on the sides of cellular phones, where they are typically programmed to invoke functions such as PTT, memo, or volume control. Softkeys are generally found on keyboards (e.g. the F keys), cellular phones, Automated Teller Machines, Primary Flight and Multi-Function Displays, although they are also found elsewhere. <b>Hard</b> <b>key</b> is the contrary term, which means a hard-coded key such as a number key pad or the Send/End key of a mobile phone. Depending on the development company, cellular phone softkeys are often called F1(Left), F2(Right).|$|E

40|$|The fiber {{spinning}} process of a viscoelastic liquid modeled by the constitutive {{theory of the}} Maxwell fluid is analyzed. The governing equations are given by one-dimensional mass, momentum and constitutive equations which arise in the slender body approximation by cross-sectional averaging of the two-dimensional axisymmetric Stokes equations with free boundary. Existence, uniqueness and regularity results are proved by means of fixed point arguments, energy estimates and weak/weak ∗ convergence methods. The difficulty in this problem lies with the constitutive model of the Maxwell fluid: when both the outflow velocity at the spinneret and the pulling velocity at take up are prescribed, a boundary condition can be imposed for {{only one of the}} two elastic stress components at the inlet.

40|$|Surface {{reconstruction}} is a <b>hard</b> <b>key</b> {{problem in}} the industrial core domain of computer-aided design (CAD) applications. A workpiece must be represented in some standard CAD object description format such that its representation can be efficiently used in a CAD process like redesign. To that end, a digitizing process represents the object surface as a weakly-structured discrete and digitized set of 3 D points. Surface reconstruction attempts to transform this representation into an efficient CAD representation. Certain classic approaches produce inefficient reconstructions of surface areas that do not correspond to construction logic. Here, a new reconstruction principle along with empiric results is presented which yields logical and efficient representations. This principle is implemented as a Genetic-Programming/Evolution-Strategy-based software system. Genetic programming (GP) [Banzhaf et al., 1998] is an evolutionary search process that generates structures of arbitrary shape and size.

40|$|In this work, {{we explore}} {{simultaneous}} designs of materials selection and structural optimization. As the material selection {{turns out to}} be a discrete process that finds the optimal distribution of materials over the design domain, it cannot be performed with common gradient-based optimization methods. In this paper, material selection is considered together with the shape and sizing optimization in a framework of multiobjective optimization of tracking the Pareto curve. The idea of mixed variables is often introduced in the case of mono-objective optimization. However, in the case of multi-objective optimization, we still face some <b>hard</b> <b>key</b> points related to the convexity and the continuity of the Pareto domain, which underline the originality of this work. In addition to the above aspect, there is a lack in the literature concerning the industrial applications that consider the mixed parameters. Continuous variables refer to structural parameters such as thickness, diameter and spring elastic constants while material ID is defined as binary design variable for each material. Both mechanical and thermal loads are considered in this work with the aim of minimizing the maximum stress and structural weight simultaneously. The efficiency of the design procedure is demonstrated through various numerical examples. Aerospace StructuresAerospace Engineerin...|$|E

30|$|This paper proposes an {{experimental}} demonstration of a wireless hyperchaotic communication based on wireless communication protocols suitable for secure real-time data or image transmissions in wireless sensor networks. We {{have proposed a}} new digital synchronized modulation based on FHS through a DFM technique between two hyperchaotic generators. The choice of a DFM principle for implementing the FHS between two identical hyperchaotic systems of Lorenz in FPGA shows more robustness than the classic chaotic masking while allowing high transmission rates. In practice, we have associated and adapted the hyperchaotic communication principle with the XBee RF modules by developing a reconfigurable VHDL-based hardware architecture implemented on FPGA technology. Indeed, the proposed system {{can be used as}} <b>hard</b> <b>key</b> generator in a hyperchaotic synchronized data or image stream cipher/decipher, and it can be used for synchronizing any four-dimensional continuous chaotic system (such as hyperchaotic Lorenz system) where the master chaotic system is embedded in the proposed FPGA transmitter side and the slave chaotic system is embedded in the FPGA receiver side. Many real-time transmission tests are carried out between two distanced Virtex II-Pro Xilinx FPGA platforms. The obtained real-time results show the efficiency of the proposed idea consisting on associating the hyperchaotic communication, and the ZigBee or Wi-Fi communication protocols characterized by high immunity against channel noise. Indeed, we could recover correctly the information data on the distance about 20 m using the XBee RF modules at - 2 dBm with a PER of 0 %. Note that these performances can be improved using the most recent XBee modules. Experimental results applied to image encryption have demonstrated that our approach exhibits attractive performances and is useful in the field of real-time secure wireless data communications. The proposed technique may make it more applicable in such field (video, image, internet, etc.) and for all type of wireless network. Indeed, thorough experimental tests have been carried out with detailed numerical analysis, demonstrating the high security of the new data or image encryption scheme. More precisely, the proposed approach used to design a secure symmetric image encryption increases its resistance to various attacks such as statistical and key analysis attacks and can avoid the hidden security attacks in real-time applications. Finally, our perspective for the presented work consists on developing and realizing a secure wireless hyperchaotic communication network using the proposed modulation system.|$|E

40|$|The exact {{hardness}} {{of computing}} a Nash equilibrium {{is a fundamental}} open question in algorithmic game theory. This problem is complete for the complexity class PPAD. It {{is well known that}} problems in PPAD cannot be NP-complete unless NP = coNP. Therefore, a natural direction is to reduce the hardness of PPAD to the hardness of problems used in cryptography. Bitansky, Paneth, and Rosen [FOCS 2015] prove the hardness of PPAD assuming the ex-istence of quasi-polynomially hard indistinguishability obfuscation and sub-exponentially hard one-way functions. This leaves open the possibility of basing PPAD hardness on simpler, poly-nomially hard, computational assumptions. We make further progress in this direction and reduce PPAD hardness directly to polyno-mially hard assumptions. Our first result proves hardness of PPAD assuming the existence of polynomially hard indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and one-way permutations. While this improves upon Bitansky et al. ’s work, it does not give us a reduction to simpler, polynomi-ally hard computational assumption because constructions of iO inherently seems to require assumptions with sub-exponential hardness. In contrast, public key functional encryption is a much simpler primitive and does not suffer from this drawback. Our second result shows that PPAD hardness can be based on polynomially <b>hard</b> public <b>key</b> functional encryption and one-way permutations. Our results further demonstrate the power of polynomially <b>hard</b> public <b>key</b> functional encryption which is believed to be weaker than indistinguishability obfuscation...|$|R
