5|$|According to Diane Dimond of Hard Copy, Torbiner's {{records show}} that Robinul and Vistarol was {{administered}} instead of sodium amytal. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was investigating Torbiner's administration of drugs in house calls, where he mostly gave patients morphine and <b>Demerol.</b> His credentials with the Board of Dental Examiners indicated that he was restricted by law to administering drugs solely for dental-related procedures, {{but he had not}} adhered to those restrictions. For instance, he had given general anesthetic to Barry Rothman during hair-transplant procedures. Torbiner had introduced Chandler and Rothman in 1991, when Rothman needed dental work.|$|E
25|$|Two small, {{placebo-controlled}} {{trials have}} been conducted to assess the efficacy of ondansetron for postanesthetic shivering, a common occurrence after surgery. Ondansetron {{was found to be}} as effective as pethidine (meperidine, <b>Demerol)</b> when given as a single intravenous dose before anesthesia.|$|E
25|$|Hydrazine sulfate {{is also a}} {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI), and is incompatible with alcohol, tranquilizers and sleeping pills (benzodiazepines and barbiturates), and other psycho-active drugs, with pethidine (meperidine, <b>Demerol),</b> and with foods containing significant amounts of the amino acid breakdown product tyramine, such as aged cheeses, raisins, avocados, processed and cured fish and meats, fermented products, and others.|$|E
25|$|Pethidine, {{also known}} as {{meperidine}} and sold under the brand name <b>Demerol</b> among others, is a synthetic opioid pain medication of the phenylpiperidine class. Synthesized in 1939 as a potential anticholinergic agent by the German chemist Otto Eisleb, its analgesic properties were first recognized by Otto Schaumann while working for IG Farben, Germany. Pethidine is the prototype of a large family of analgesics including the pethidine 4-phenylpiperidines (piminodine, anileridine and others), the prodines (alphaprodine, MPPP, etc.), bemidones (ketobemidone, etc.) and others more distant, including diphenoxylate and analogues.|$|E
25|$|Shipman studied {{medicine}} at Leeds School of Medicine and graduated in 1970. He started working at Pontefract General Infirmary in Pontefract, West Riding of Yorkshire, and in 1974 {{took his first}} position as a general practitioner (GP) at the Abraham Ormerod Medical Centre in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. In 1975, he was caught forging prescriptions of pethidine (<b>Demerol)</b> for his own use. He was fined £600 and briefly attended a drug rehabilitation clinic in York. He became a GP at the Donneybrook Medical Centre in Hyde near Manchester, in 1977.|$|E
500|$|According to Dr. Nader Kamangar, a {{sleeping}} expert at UCLA, {{drugs such as}} <b>Demerol</b> can cause insomnia. In the case of Jackson, insomnia could {{have been caused by}} [...] "anxiety for performing" [...] as well.|$|E
500|$|Following Jackson's death, {{reports of}} {{his use of}} {{pethidine}} (<b>Demerol)</b> surfaced. Cherilyn Lee, a nurse who provided nutritional counseling to Jackson, said that on April 12, 2009, he asked her for unspecified [...] "products for sleep." [...] On April 19, 2009, he told her the only medicine that would help was propofol. Lee refused, telling him, [...] "Michael, {{the only problem with}} you taking this medication ... is you're going to take it and you're not going to wake up." [...] Jackson dismissed the warning, telling her he had been given the drug before by IV injection and that his doctor told him it was safe. He did not name the doctor. [...] An overdose of propofol can cause the patient to stop breathing, leading to a shortage of oxygen and a buildup of carbon dioxide in the body which can lead to arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.|$|E
500|$|Jackson's health had {{deteriorated}} {{to the extent}} that he cancelled the remainder of his tour and flew with friends Elizabeth Taylor and her husband to London. When the singer arrived at the airport, he had to be held up by his two friends; he was then rushed to the home of Elton John's manager and then to a clinic. He was searched for drugs on entry; vials of medicine were found in a suitcase. He took over the fourth floor of the hospital and was put on Valium IV to wean him from painkillers. The singer's spokesperson then told reporters that Jackson was [...] "barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level." [...] While in the clinic, Jackson took part in group and one-on-one therapy sessions. According to Taraborrelli, in January 2004, as his trial approached, Jackson became dependent on morphine and <b>Demerol</b> [...] and was being treated for this dependency by herbalist Alfredo Bowman in Colorado.|$|E
500|$|In January 2010, Montag {{revealed}} to People {{that she had}} undergone ten cosmetic surgery procedures {{in a single day}} two months prior, performed by Frank Ryan. Among the procedures were brow-lifts, ear-pinnings, a chin reduction, as well as a second rhinoplasty and second breast augmentation. She commented that she almost died from too much <b>Demerol,</b> reducing her heart rate to five beats per minute. Her debut studio album Superficial was digitally released later that month to an overwhelmingly negative critical response from critics. The self-funded record cost nearly $2 million and sold approximately 1,000 copies in first-week downloads, failing to earn back the money spent making it. In May, she and Pratt made their final appearance on The Hills halfway through the sixth and final season. In December 2013, Montag stated that she and Conrad have [...] "talked a few times" [...] since the series' conclusion, elaborating that [...] "it's unfortunate things happened the way that it did, but we're both different people now, older and more mature." [...] However, in 2015, Montag angrily excoriated Conrad when she appeared on Marriage Boot Camp, during a sequence where the contestants were asked to forgive someone who had hurt them in the past; Montag told a stand-in for Conrad that Conrad had [...] "ruined my life with her lies", said that Conrad DID have a sex tape and had falsely blamed it on her, and that she [...] "forgave" [...] Conrad for being terrible and trying to ruin her life. Montag was universally lambasted for bringing up the sex tape lies anew, parroting the views of Pratt (who Conrad actually blamed for spreading the false rumors; Conrad felt Montag knew he was lying but took Pratt's side because she loved him) and trying to use Conrad's name to get publicity for herself.|$|E

Cade mentioned, [...] "If you told a football player that you were giving him <b>Demerol</b> to relieve pain and you gave him a placebo instead, there's about a 30% chance that the placebo will relieve the pain as much as taking <b>Demerol</b> would have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Even more sensational accusations {{were made}} by a nurse, Tammy Payette, who contended that Lafferty and a {{prominent}} Beverly Hills physician, Dr. Charles Kivowitz, had conspired to hasten Duke's death with morphine and <b>Demerol.</b> [...] In 1996, the year Lafferty died, the Los Angeles District Attorney's office ruled there was no firm evidence of foul play.|$|E
2500|$|The third {{degree murder}} charge relates to Karnamaya Mongar; {{according}} to prosecutors, Gosnell's staff gave the 90-pound woman a lethal dose of anesthesia and painkillers. [...] Gosnell's lawyer asserts that Karnamaya Mongar also {{had in her}} system other drugs that {{did not come from}} Gosnell's clinic, and that none of the infants were born alive. The claim was rejected by the Grand Jury, based upon expert testimony that [...] "it was the overdose of <b>Demerol,</b> not some mystery pill, that killed Mrs. Mongar." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the {{procedure}} {{the patient is}} often given sedation intravenously, employing agents such as fentanyl or midazolam. Although meperidine (<b>Demerol)</b> {{may be used as}} an alternative to fentanyl, the concern of seizures has relegated this agent to second choice for sedation behind the combination of fentanyl and midazolam. [...] The average person will receive a combination of these two drugs, usually between 25 and 100µg IV fentanyl and 1–4mg IV midazolam. [...] Sedation practices vary between practitioners and nations; in some clinics in Norway, sedation is rarely administered.|$|E

"Morphine"'s central themes is {{the drug}} usage of <b>Demerol.</b> In the track, he sings, [...] "Trust in me/Just in me/Put all your trust in me/You're doin' morphine...Go on babe/Relax/This won't hurt you/Before I put it in/Close {{your eyes and}} count to ten/Don't cry/I won't convert you/There's no need to dismay/Close your eyes and drift away". [...] "Scream Louder" [...] {{contains}} elements from [...] "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)", performed by Sly & the Family Stone. [...] "2 Bad" [...] contains a recreation of a melody line of Jackson's 1983 hit [...] "Beat It" [...] {{as well as a}} rap by John Forté and guitar solo by Wyclef Jean.|$|E
2500|$|Itching and {{flushing}} {{and other}} effects of blood vessel dilation are also common side-effects, due to histamine release {{in response to}} the drug using one or more types of receptors in the CNS or other responses elsewhere in the body. [...] First-generation antihistamines such as tripelennamine (Pyrabenzamine), clemastine (Tavist), hydroxyzine (Atarax), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), cyproheptadine (Periactin), brompheniramine (Dimetapp), chlorphenamine (Chlor-Trimeton), doxylamine (NyQuil) and phenyltoloxamine (Percogesic Original Formula) not only combat the histamine-driven side-effects, but are analgesic-sparing (potentiating) in various degrees. The antihistamine promethazine (Phenergan) may also {{have a positive effect on}} hepatic metabolism of dihydrocodeine as it does with codeine. Higher doses of promethazine may interfere with most other opioids with the exception of the pethidine family (<b>Demerol</b> and the like) by this or other unknown mechanisms.|$|E
2500|$|By 1959, Flynn's {{financial}} difficulties {{had become so}} serious that he flew to Vancouver, British Columbia on 9 October to negotiate the lease of his yacht Zaca to the businessman George Caldough. As Caldough was driving Flynn and the young actress Beverly Aadland, who had accompanied him on the trip, to the airport on 14 October for a Los Angeles-bound flight, Flynn began complaining of severe pain in his back and legs. Caldough transported him to the residence of a doctor, Grant Gould, who noted that Flynn had considerable difficulty negotiating the building's stairway. Gould, assuming that the pain was due to degenerative disc disease and spinal osteoarthritis, administered 50 milligrams of <b>demerol</b> intravenously. As Flynn's discomfort diminished, he [...] "reminisced at great length about his past experiences" [...] to those present. He refused a drink when offered it.|$|E
2500|$|Lillian and Bela, {{as well as}} his mother, vacationed {{on their}} lake {{property}} in Lake Elsinore, California (then called Elsinore), on two lots between 1944 and 1953. Bela Lugosi Jr. attended the Elsinore Naval & Military School in Lake Elsinore. Lillian and Béla divorced in 1953, at least partially because of Béla's jealousy over Lillian taking a full-time job as an assistant to Brian Donlevy on the sets and studios for Donlevy's radio and television series Dangerous Assignment – Lillian eventually did marry Brian Donlevy, in 1966. Lugosi married Hope Lininger, his fifth wife, in 1955; they remained married until his death. She had been a fan, writing letters to him {{when he was in the}} hospital recovering from addiction to <b>Demerol.</b> She would sign her letters [...] "A dash of Hope".

Despite having reached an agreement with her doctor about what drugs she was to be given during the procedure, while {{in the early stages of}} labor Ostriker inadvertently consented to being injected with <b>Demerol,</b> a sedative, thinking it was a local analgesic. Under the effects of the <b>Demerol,</b> Ostriker then consented to receive a spinal anesthetic, which left her unable to feel anything from the waist down. Upon waking, Ostriker was furious about being deprived of the experience of natural childbirth and relates the invasion of her body by the medical professionals who delivered the child to the US invasion of Cambodia.|$|E
50|$|First to {{take the}} stand was Dr. Robert Waldman, a {{physician}} specializing in internal medicine, Nephrology and Addiction medicine, has been involved in addiction medicine and treating patients who have addiction diseases for 23 years but is not board-certified in it. He described to the court what happens to a patient during addiction and withdrawal, including the tell-tale signs, the symptoms and the drugs that can be involved. Dr. Waldman stated that the side effects of withdrawal of drugs are sweating, increase heart rate, nausea, cramp, insomnia, temperature deregulation and tremendous anxiety. It was heard that the addict's biggest fear is that you're not going to respect the amount of discomfort they'll go through during treatment and detoxing process. It was also heard that rapid detox is not a treatment. It uses high levels of sedation intravenously and it is a process that uses general anesthesia to help tolerate the discomfort. It was heard that Dr. Waldman's opinion is that there is evidence to suggest Jackson was dependent (not addicted) on <b>Demerol</b> (pethidine) due to the frequent high doses he received in May 2009 indicated by Dr. Klein's medical records of Omar Arnold (an alias of Jackson's). It was heard that Dr. Klein's medical records indicate that in April 2009, Jackson received 775 mg of <b>Demerol</b> for Botox and Restylane procedures. During the three days in beginning of May 2009, Jackson received another 900 mg of <b>Demerol</b> for Botox and Restylane procedures. Dr. Waldman said being injected during 6 days with very high doses of <b>Demerol</b> would create opioid dependency in anyone of us.|$|E

50|$|As another example, in {{anesthesia}} (particularly IV anesthesia {{and general}} anesthesia) multiple agents {{are almost always}} required - including hypnotics or analgesic inducing/maintenance agents such as Versed or Diprivan, usually an opioid analgesic such as morphine or <b>Demerol,</b> a paralytic such as vecuronium, and in inhaled general anesthesia generally a halogenated ether anesthetic such as sevoflurane or desflurane.|$|E
