40|$|AbstractThe {{analysis}} of the required skills and knowledge for every field of study {{is of paramount importance}} specifically <b>for</b> <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>fields</b> such as translation. These skills and knowledge are broadly termed as competence by scholars. As a complex term, the definition of translation competence as well as the categorization of its components has been subject to changes since its infancy. Some of the newer models viewed translation competence as a linguistic competence or as a supercompetence; while, in more recent models a multicomponential view is taken to identify the several competences included in translation competence. Consequently, the present paper seeks to provide a general review of the varying insights of the term and the numerous models provided by translation scholars...|$|E

40|$|Cognitive Hearing Science or Auditory Cognitive Science is an {{emerging}} field of interdisciplinary research concerning {{the interactions between}} hearing and cognition. It follows a trend over {{the last half century}} <b>for</b> <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>fields</b> to develop, beginning with Neuroscience, then Cognitive Science, then Cognitive Neuroscience, and then Cognitive Vision Science. A common theme is that an interdisciplinary approach is necessary to understand complex human behaviors, to develop technologies incorporating knowledge of these behaviors, and to find solutions for individuals with impairments that undermine typical behaviors. Accordingly, researchers in traditional academic disciplines, such as Psychology, Physiology, Linguistics, Philosophy, Anthropology, and Sociology benefit from collaborations with each other, and with researchers in Computer Science and Engineering working on the design of technologies, and with health professionals working with individuals who have impairments. The factors that triggered the emergence of Cognitive Hearing Science include the maturation of the component disciplines of Hearing Science and Cognitive Science, new opportunities to use complex digital signal-processing to design technologies suited to performance in challenging everyday environments, and increasing social imperatives to help people whose communication problems span hearing and cognition. Cognitive Hearing Science is illustrated in research on three general topics: (1) language processing in challenging listening conditions; (2) use of auditory communication technologies or the visual modality to boost performance; (3) changes in performance with development, aging, and rehabilitative training. Future directions for modeling and the translation of research into practice are suggested.

40|$|Conservation {{behavior}} {{is a relatively}} new <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>field</b> aimed at investigating how proximate and ultimate aspects of animal behavior can be of value in preventing the loss of biodiversity. This new discipline’s usefulness in promoting practical conservation-matters is subject to debate, with some scientists arguing that the importance of behavior in conservation practice is overemphasized. Here, we propose a conceptual model that identifies the key linkages between animal behavior and conserva-tion biology. The model is a simply structured, hierarchical, and parsimonious framework that will help bridge the gap between the 2 disciplines and establish a common ground on which the field of conservation behavior can evolve and from which paradigms can be developed. Key words: adaptive behavior, behavior-based management, behavioral indicators, conceptual model, conservation behavior.

30|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigated}} f-divergences that originate from the Csiszár functional and their {{link to the}} Jensen inequality with {{a specific type of}} the Jensen-type interpolating inequalities. By means of these inequalities we derived new bounds for f-divergences in general via the Csiszár functional and in particular for the Kullback–Leibler divergence, Hellinger distance, Bhattacharyya distance (coefficient), χ^ 2 -divergence, total variation distance and triangular discrimination. Consequently, we deduced analogous results {{in the light of the}} well-known Zipf–Mandelbrot law, with the adequate probability mass functions and the adjusted form of the Csiszár functional. The Zipf–Mandelbrot law was analyzed as a more general form of the Zipf law, for which we also gave the corresponding results and an application in linguistics in order to accentuate its experimental character. Thus this paper includes three important and widely investigated issues: the Jensen inequality, the divergences (for probability distributions) and the Zipf–Mandelbrot law with its less general, but not less important form, the Zipf law. In this way, the paper can be of an interest for mathematicians who investigate any of these fields with an accent put on mathematical inequalities, as well as <b>for</b> the <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>fields</b> (e.g. linguistics was involved in this case).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>fields</b> of migration and mobilities research by temporalizing understandings of their boundaries – places where differences have been entrenched and some concepts have remained beyond negotiation or dialogue. While the creativity and boundary-crossing potential of <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>fields</b> is often set in opposition to disciplines, which define and regulate appropriate concepts and knowledge, such characterizations obscure how <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>fields</b> have boundaries that change over and in relation to time. This paper therefore uses three temporal dynamics – a/synchronicity, sequencing, and accumulation over time – to consider the evolving boundaries that have limited collaboration between these fields. By tracing past discussions of concepts such as ‘transnationalism’, ‘mobility’ and ‘methodological nationalism’, it highlights the contingency and complexity of dialogue between these fields, and how they, like disciplines, ‘define what it is permissible not to know’ (Abbott, 2001, p. 130). The new concept of ‘migrant exceptionalism’ is introduced to acknowledge the boundaries created through privileging ‘migrants’ as unique and continuously relevant subjects. Both migration and mobilities scholars are seen to perpetuate migrant exceptionalism, and countering it through the study of sometimes-migrants is identified {{as a means of}} modulating existing boundaries and opening new spaces <b>for</b> <b>interdisciplinary</b> dialogue...|$|R
