5|$|Players {{control a}} monocle- and pith helmet–wearing Velociraptor driving a jeep. The {{aim of the}} game is to attain a high score by {{performing}} stunts, damaging the jeep during collisions, collecting orbs, and killing the other Velociraptor which run around the area. The vehicle is equipped with a spiked ball and chain which can be deployed from the tailgate as many times as the player wishes. Deploying the spiked ball increases the difficulty of maneuvering the vehicle. The ball can be released from the chain at any time, if done so during a turn the weapon is launched forward. Players kill other Velociraptor by ramming them with the jeep or crushing them with the spiked ball which is dragged behind the vehicle. Slain dinosaurs can be dragged to <b>exporters</b> by the spiked ball and chain to gain extra points. <b>Exporters</b> are teleporting devices which transport the slain dinosaurs to the future.|$|E

5|$|In the 2005–2014 petrodollar surge, {{financial}} decision-makers {{were able}} to benefit somewhat from the lessons and experiences of the previous cycle. Developing economies generally stayed better balanced {{than they did in}} the 1970s; the world economy was less oil-intensive; and global inflation and interest rates were much better contained. Oil <b>exporters</b> opted to make most of their investments directly into a diverse array of global markets, and the recycling process was less dependent on intermediary channels such as international banks and the IMF.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of {{intervention}} in the foreign exchange market by national government authorities, the exchange rate of a country's currency is determined, in general, by market forces {{of supply and demand}} at a point in time.

5|$|The foreign {{exchange}} rules also oblige Icelandic residents to deposit any new foreign currency they receive with an Icelandic bank. There is anecdotal evidence that some Icelandic <b>exporters</b> had been operating an informal offshore {{foreign exchange}} market, trading pounds and euros for krónur outside {{the control of}} any regulator and starving the onshore market of foreign currency. Hence the Central Bank had to sell €124 million of currency reserves in November 2008 {{to make up the}} difference, compared with an estimated trade surplus of €13.9 million.|$|E

50|$|While {{a seller}} (or <b>exporter)</b> can require the {{purchaser}} (an importer) to prepay for goods shipped, the purchaser (importer) {{may wish to}} reduce risk by requiring the seller to document the goods that have been shipped. Banks may assist by providing various forms of support. For example, the importer's bank may provide a letter of credit to the <b>exporter</b> (or the <b>exporter's</b> bank) providing for payment upon presentation of certain documents, such as a bill of lading. The <b>exporter's</b> bank may make a loan (by advancing funds) to the <b>exporter</b> {{on the basis of}} the export contract.|$|R

5|$|A {{report in}} 2010 by Nekaris etal. {{reported}} that Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand {{were the primary}} <b>exporters</b> of slow lorises, with Singapore and Malaysia also involved. China and Indonesia were also known for international trade, although their local trade was more significant. Slow loris parts were typically exported from Thailand and Cambodia, but Malaysia and Singapore primarily exported live animals. The most noteworthy importer was Japan, followed by the United States and then the European Union. More than half of 400illegal imports were live animals (238), while the rest were either body parts (122) or unspecified (40).|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Iron Curtain and the {{economic}} and political barriers that followed, central and eastern European countries with local mushroom harvesting traditions, such as Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia, developed into <b>exporters</b> of porcini, concentrating primarily on the Italian market. Exported porcini and other wild fungi are also destined for France, Germany and other western European markets, where demand for them exists, but collection on a commercial scale does not. Picking B.edulis has become an annual seasonal income earner and pastime in countries like Bulgaria, especially for many Roma communities and the unemployed. A lack of control has led to heavy exploitation of the mushroom resource.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the crisis}} in Europe, the {{modernization}} of sericulture in Japan made it the world's foremost silk producer. By the early 20th century, rapidly industrializing Japan was producing as much as 60 percent of the world's raw silk, most exports shipping through the port of Yokohama. Italy managed to rebound from the crisis, but France was unable. Urbanization in Europe saw many French and Italian agricultural workers leave silk growing for more lucrative factory work. Raw silk was imported from Japan to fill the void. Asian countries, formerly <b>exporters</b> of raw materials (cocoons and raw silk), progressively began to export more and more finished garments.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the financing terms that support {{international trade and}} sheds light on how and why these arrangements affect trade. Using detailed transaction level data from a U. S. based <b>exporter</b> of frozen and refrigerated food products, primarily poultry, it begins by describing broad patterns {{about the use of}} alternative financing terms. These patterns help discipline a model in which the trade finance mode is shaped by the risk that an importer defaults on an <b>exporter</b> and by the possibility that an <b>exporter</b> does not deliver goods as specified in the contract. The empirical results indicate that transactions are more likely to occur on cash in advance or letter of credit terms when the importer is located in a country with weak contractual enforcement and in a country that is further from the <b>exporter.</b> Letters of credit, however, are rarely used by the <b>exporter.</b> As an importer develops a relationship with the <b>exporter,</b> transactions are less likely to occur on terms that require prepayment. During the recent crisis, the <b>exporter</b> was more likely to demand cash in advance terms when transacting with new customers, and customers that traded on cash in advance terms prior to the crisis disproportionately reduced their purchases. These results can be rationalized by the model whenever (i) misbehavior {{on the part of the}} <b>exporter</b> is of little concern to importers, and (ii) local banks in importing countries are typically more effective than the <b>exporter</b> in pursuing financial claims against importers. ...|$|R
5|$|In 1999, 220 coffee growers {{formed an}} {{association}} in the Maraba district (part {{of the former}} Butare Province) to tackle this problem. Many of these farmers had lost family members during the 1994 genocide, while others had husbands in prison, accused of participating in the killings and due to face trial in the traditional gacaca courts. They named the association Abahuzamugambi, a Kinyarwanda word for people who work together to achieve a goal. The farmers hoped that by forming the association, they would increase revenue by selling directly to <b>exporters</b> in Kigali instead of through an intermediary transport company. They divided their profits and used them to buy tools, fertilisers and seeds to increase yields.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to his}} August 1990 Invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein {{was pushing}} OPEC to end {{overproduction}} and to send oil prices higher, {{in order to help}} OPEC members financially and to accelerate rebuilding from the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War. But these two Iraqi wars against fellow OPEC founders marked a low point in the cohesion of the organization, and oil prices subsided quickly after the short-term supply disruptions. The September 2001 Al Qaeda attacks on the US and the March 2003 US invasion of Iraq had even milder short-term impacts on oil prices, as Saudi Arabia and other <b>exporters</b> again cooperated to keep the world adequately supplied.|$|E

Sectors of the economy were to have progressively entered the NZ ETS, with forestry the first from January 2008 and agriculture last in January 2013. Allocation rules varied between sectors. In general, participants who could pass on costs of the ETS, such as fuel companies, would not be allocated free units. Participants such as <b>exporters</b> with products that are priced internationally, would be allocated free units.|$|E

5|$|The Dead Sea is {{receding}} at {{an alarming}} rate. Multiple canals and pipelines were proposed to reduce its recession, which had begun causing many problems. The Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance project, carried out by Jordan, will provide water to neighbouring countries, while the brine will be carried to the Dead Sea to help stabilise its levels. The {{first phase of the}} project is scheduled to begin in 2018 and to be completed in 2021.

5|$|There are {{alternative}} uses of {{food power}} as well. An importer can refuse to continue import unless political concessions are made. This {{would have the}} same effects that an exporter refusing to export would have. An example of this would be American reduction of the Cuban sugar quota. In simple terms, the demand concentration (one importer being the dominant buyer) and supply dispersion (several <b>exporters</b> competing to sell the same product) an importer can try to use this exchange politically to their favor; this is especially effective if the exporter has little else so export (low action independence).|$|E
5|$|Although the durian is not {{native to}} Thailand, {{the country is}} {{currently}} {{one of the major}} <b>exporters</b> of durians, growing 781,000 tonnes of the world's total harvest of 1,400,000 tonnes in 1999, 111,000 tonnes of which it exported to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Canada. Malaysia and Indonesia follow, both producing about 265,000 tonnes each. Of this, Malaysia exported 35,000 tonnes in 1999. Chantaburi in Thailand each year holds the World Durian Festival in early May. This single province is responsible for half of the durian production of Thailand. In the Philippines, the centre of durian production is the Davao Region. The Kadayawan Festival is an annual celebration featuring the durian in Davao City. Other places where durian farms are located include Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, India, the West Indies, Florida, Hawaii, Papua New Guinea, the Polynesian Islands, Madagascar, southern China (Hainan Island), northern Australia, and Singapore.|$|E

5|$|Canada {{is one of}} the few {{developed}} nations that are net <b>exporters</b> of energy. Atlantic Canada possesses vast offshore deposits of natural gas, and Alberta also hosts large oil and gas resources. The vastness of the Athabasca oil sands and other assets results in Canada having a 13% share of global oil reserves, comprising the world's third-largest share after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies are one of the most important global producers of wheat, canola, and other grains. Canada's Ministry of Natural Resources provides statistics regarding its major exports; the country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal and lead. Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustainable because of nearby mines or sources of timber. Canada also has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries.|$|E
5|$|Mason {{was named}} one of his state's delegates to the Constitutional Convention and {{traveled}} to Philadelphia, his only lengthy trip outside Virginia. Many clauses in the document bear his stamp, as he {{was active in the}} convention for months before deciding that he could not sign it. He cited the lack of a bill of rights most prominently in his Objections, but also wanted an immediate end to the slave trade and a supermajority for navigation acts, which might force <b>exporters</b> of tobacco to use more expensive American ships. He failed to attain those objectives there, and again at the Virginia Ratifying Convention of 1788, but his prominent fight for a bill of rights led fellow Virginian James Madison to introduce one during the First Congress in 1789, and it was ratified in 1791, a year before Mason died. Obscure after his death, in the 20th and 21st centuries, Mason has come to be recognized for his contributions to the United States, and to Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The {{college is}} {{actively}} involved in the development and use of assistive technology to aid visually impaired people in their everyday lives. For example, working with a United States-based software engineer, RNC produced the T3 (Talking Tactile Tablet), a touch sensitive device for interpreting tactile images such as diagrams, charts and maps. The device is connected to a computer and run with a programme CD, and has a tactile surface which produces touchable icons that provide audio feedback when they are pressed. The device was originally developed for educational purposes but can be adapted for other uses. In 2005 Hereford Museum and Art Gallery became the first in the United Kingdom to invest in the technology.
