5|$|Goeben {{returned}} fire {{shortly afterward}} and hit Evstafi {{in the middle}} funnel; the shell detonated after it passed through the funnel and destroyed the antennae for the fire-control radio, which meant that Evstafi could not correct Ioann Zlatousts inaccurate range data. The other ships either used Ioann Zlatousts <b>incorrect</b> <b>data</b> or never saw Goeben and failed to register any hits on the German ship. Goeben hit Evstafi four more times, although one shell failed to detonate, before Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon decided to turn away and break contact after fourteen minutes of combat. Evstafi suffered 34 killed and 24 wounded from those hits, and only fired between 12 and 16 twelve-inch shells, as well as 14 eight-inch and 19 six-inch shells. Ioann Zlatoust fired only six shells from her main armament.|$|E

25|$|On 12 July 2008 an <b>incorrect</b> <b>data</b> table {{disabled}} {{an estimated}} 72,000 Oyster cards, including Travelcards, staff passes, Freedom Passes, child Oyster cards and other electronic tickets. The Oyster system {{was shut down}} and later restarted during traffic hours. Some customers already in the system were overcharged. Refunds were given to those affected and all disabled cards were replaced. Freedom Pass holders had to apply to their local authority for replacement passes (as these are not managed by TfL).|$|E
25|$|Studies {{were also}} carried out {{that showed that}} aircrew could have {{difficulty}} recognising that <b>incorrect</b> <b>data</b> had been entered in avionic equipment resulting in poor take-off performance.

A lock is a programming language construct that allows one thread to take control of a variable and prevent other threads from reading or writing it, until that variable is unlocked. The thread holding the lock is free to execute its critical section (the section of a program that requires exclusive access to some variable), and to unlock the data when it is finished. Therefore, to guarantee correct program execution, the above program can be rewritten to use locks: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{accident}} {{started at}} 12:40:26 WST {{when one of}} the aircraft’s three air data inertial reference units (ADIRU) started providing <b>incorrect</b> <b>data</b> to the flight computer. In response to the anomalous data, the autopilot disengaged automatically, and a few seconds later, the pilots received electronic messages on the aircraft ECAM, warning them of an irregularity with the autopilot and inertial reference systems, and aural stall and overspeed warnings. During this time, the pilot took control of the aircraft, increasing the altitude to 37,180 ft. The autopilot was then re-engaged and the aircraft started to return to the prior selected flight level. The autopilot was disengaged by the crew after about 15 seconds and would remain disengaged {{for the remainder of the}} flight.|$|E
2500|$|The State Supervisory Commission for Flight Safety board cited {{among the}} causes of the crash {{included}} failure of the artificial horizon, poor visibility from the cockpit, and lack of warnings indicating the failure of the artificial horizon. [...] Due to the damage to the aircraft caused by the crash, it was impossible to determine if the ailerons were functioning correctly at the time. [...] The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorders were both missing the last six seconds of data, presumably as result of the damage in the post-crash fire. [...] The board concluded that the crew demonstrated excellent calm in the emergency in their efforts to fly with <b>incorrect</b> <b>data</b> from the aircraft; weather was not determined to be a primary cause of the crash. [...] It is worth noting that one member of the board, Markov, disagreed with the findings of the report and attributed the accident to pilot error; [...] but he was overruled by Gosavianadzor who sided {{with the rest of the}} board.|$|E
