30|$|Despite {{particular}} concern, {{the availability}} of information regarding <b>developmental</b> <b>neurotoxicity</b> of chemicals is very limited, even for humans. In a systematic literature review considering the neurotoxic potential of industrial chemicals to human populations, Grandjean and Landrigan identified 201 proven human neurotoxicants [34] and, moreover, they estimate that there are over 1000 compounds which were neurotoxic in laboratory animals, respectively [21]. Five of the 201 chemicals identified as human neurotoxicants were also classified as developmental neurotoxicants, while the other compounds could not be classified {{due to lack of}} experimental data [34]. Such low numbers demonstrate a clear lack of <b>developmental</b> <b>neurotoxicity</b> assessment studies. Additionally, a 2009 report indicated that only around 110 chemicals had been tested for potential human <b>developmental</b> <b>neurotoxicity</b> following respective OECD or US-EPA guidelines [35, 36]. As a consequence, there is a demand for time and cost-efficient testing methods capable of evaluating large numbers of chemicals for <b>developmental</b> <b>neurotoxicity.</b> Such methods may include in vitro and in silico tools as well as in vivo studies with alternative model species such as zebrafish (Danio rerio) [36]. Based on the 2009 reports [35, 36], an international collaboration was started led by Prof. E. Fritsche (IUF) with the goal to assemble a <b>developmental</b> <b>neurotoxicity</b> (DNT) testing battery for regulatory purposes.

Arsenic contamination of shallow groundwater is a natural occurring problem that has been further made worse by the use of tube wells, which extract groundwater. Since the 1970s, the government started instituting the use of shallow tube wells to avoid the consumption of surface water, which is often contaminated with various bacteria. These tube wells, however, reached the arsenic-contaminated groundwater. This issue is more prevalent in inland areas and for rural areas, where 97% of the population uses tube wells.

30|$|Perfluorinated {{compounds}} [PFCs] {{have found}} a wide use in industrial products and processes and in {{a vast array of}} consumer products. PFCs are molecules made up of carbon chains to which fluorine atoms are bound. Due to the strength of the carbon/fluorine bond, the molecules are chemically very stable and are highly resistant to biological degradation; therefore, they belong to a class of compounds that tend to persist in the environment. These compounds can bioaccumulate and also undergo biomagnification. Within the class of PFC chemicals, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorosulphonic acid are generally considered reference substances. Meanwhile, PFCs can be detected almost ubiquitously, e.g., in water, plants, different kinds of foodstuffs, in animals such as fish, birds, in mammals, as well as in human breast milk and blood. PFCs are proposed as a new class of 'persistent organic pollutants'. Numerous publications allude to the negative effects of PFCs on human health. The following review describes both external and internal exposures to PFCs, the toxicokinetics (uptake, distribution, metabolism, excretion), and the toxicodynamics (acute toxicity, subacute and subchronic toxicities, chronic toxicity including carcinogenesis, genotoxicity and epigenetic effects, reproductive and <b>developmental</b> toxicities, <b>neurotoxicity,</b> effects on the endocrine system, immunotoxicity and potential modes of action, combinational effects, and epidemiological studies on perfluorinated compounds).|$|R

Although their acute neurotoxicity to adults has been well characterized, information regarding the potential <b>developmental</b> <b>neurotoxicity</b> of this class of compounds is limited. There is a large age dependence to the acute toxicity of pyrethroids in which neonatal rats are at least an order of magnitude more sensitive than adults to two pyrethroids.

The carcinogenicity, reproductive and <b>developmental</b> toxicity, <b>neurotoxicity</b> and chronic toxicity toward humans and animals have been experimentally proven. RhB cannot be effectively removed by biological treatment due to the slow kinetics. Therefore, RhB is chosen as a model pollutant for liquid phase plasma (LPP) treatment in the present investigation. Results: This paper presents experimental results for the bleaching of RhB from aqueous solutions {{in the presence of}} TiO 2 photocatalyst with LPP system.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Fish {{and seafood}} provide {{important}} nutrients {{but may also}} contain toxic contaminants, such as methylmercury. Advisories against pollutants may therefore conflict with dietary recommendations. In resolving this conundrum, most epidemiologic studies provide little guidance because they address either nutrient benefits or mercury toxicity, not both. OBJECTIVES: Impact on the same health outcomes by two exposures originating from the same food source provides a classical example of confounding. To explore the extent of this bias, we applied structural equation modeling to data from a prospective study of <b>developmental</b> methylmercury <b>neurotoxicity</b> in the Faroe Islands. RESULTS: Adjustment for the benefits conferred by maternal fish intake during pregnancy resulted in an increased effect of the prenatal methylmercury exposure, {{as compared with the}} unadjusted results. The dietary questionnaire response is likely to be an imprecise proxy for the transfer of seafood nutrients to the fetus, and this imprecision may bias the confounder-adjusted mercury effect estimate. We explored the magnitude of this bias in sensitivity analysis assuming a range of error variances. At realistic imprecision levels, mercury-associated deficits increased by up to 2 -fold when compared with the unadjusted effects. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that uncontrolled confounding from a beneficial parameter, and imprecision of this confounder, may cause substantial underestimation of the effects of a toxic exposure. The adverse effects of methylmercury exposure from fish and seafood are therefore likely to be underestimated by unadjusted results from observational studies, and the extent of this bias will be study dependent...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{contamination}} has exposed {{humans to}} various metal agents, including mercury. It {{has been determined}} that mercury is not only harmful {{to the health of}} vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and children, but is also toxic to ordinary adults in various ways. For many years, mercury was used {{in a wide variety of}} human activities. Nowadays, the exposure to this metal from both natural and artificial sources is significantly increasing. Recent studies suggest that chronic exposure, even to low concentration levels of mercury, can cause cardiovascular, reproductive, and <b>developmental</b> toxicity, <b>neurotoxicity,</b> nephrotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. Possible biological effects of mercury, including the relationship between mercury toxicity and diseases of the cardiovascular system, such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, and myocardial infarction, are being studied. As heart rhythm and function are under autonomic nervous system control, it has been hypothesized that the neurotoxic effects of mercury might also impact cardiac autonomic function. Mercury exposure could have a long-lasting effect on cardiac parasympathetic activity and some evidence has shown that mercury exposure might affect heart rate variability, particularly early exposures in children. The mechanism by which mercury produces toxic effects on the cardiovascular system is not fully elucidated, but this mechanism is believed to involve an increase in oxidative stress. The exposure to mercury increases the production of free radicals, potentially because of the role of mercury in the Fenton reaction and a reduction in the activity of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase.

40|$|Pyrethroid {{insecticides}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} commonly used residential and agricultural insecticides. Based on the increased use of pyrethroids and recent studies showing that pregnant women and children are exposed to pyrethroids, there are concerns over the potential for <b>developmental</b> <b>neurotoxicity.</b> However, there have been relatively few studies on the <b>developmental</b> <b>neurotoxicity</b> of pyrethroids. In this study, we sought to investigate the developmental toxicity of six common pyrethroids, three type I compounds (permethrin, resmethrin, and bifenthrin) and three type II compounds (deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and λ-cyhalothrin), and to determine whether zebrafish embryos may be an appropriate model for studying the <b>developmental</b> <b>neurotoxicity</b> of pyrethroids. Exposure of zebrafish embryos to pyrethroids caused a dose-dependent increase in mortality and pericardial edema, with type II compounds being the most potent. At doses approaching the LC 50, permethrin and deltamethrin caused craniofacial abnormalities. These findings are consistent with mammalian studies demonstrating that pyrethroids are mildly teratogenic at very high doses. However, at lower doses, body axis curvature and spasms were observed, which were reminiscent of the classic syndromes observed with pyrethroid toxicity. Treatment with diazepam ameliorated the spasms, while treatment with the sodium channel antagonist MS- 222 ameliorated both spasms and body curvature, suggesting that pyrethroid-induced neurotoxicity is similar in zebrafish and mammals. Taken in concert, these data suggest that zebrafish may be an appropriate alternative model to study the mechanism(s) responsible for the <b>developmental</b> <b>neurotoxicity</b> of pyrethroid insecticides and aid in identification of compounds that should be further tested in mammalian systems...|$|E
40|$|In general, it is {{believed}} that the possibility of an adverse developmental outcome following conception is relatively high. In most cases, the cause of the defect is not clear, although exposure to chemical agents at a critical period during development has been proposed to play a significant role.

40|$|The {{developing}} {{brain is}} the most susceptible target for methylmercury (MeHg) toxicity. Typical features of <b>developmental</b> MeHg <b>neurotoxicity</b> include the delayed onset of symptoms and the persistency of dysfunction. One of the factors which may modulate MeHg neurotoxicity is co-exposure to other neurotoxic pollutant, e. g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from the same dietary sources. Because PCBs themselves can induce subtle neurodevelopmental deficiencies, recent epidemiological and research {{studies have focused on}} the potential hazard resulting from mixtures of PCBs and MeHg. This work summarizes our experimental findings on several endpoints of the cholinergic and aminergic systems in the developing rat brain, following two distinct perinatal co-exposure protocols involving low to moderate doses of MeHg and PCB 153 or PCB 126. The neurochemical modifications induced by either agent, alone or combined, involved monoamineoxidase type-B activity, biogenic amine levels (e. g., serotonin and dopamine), total cholinergic muscarinic receptors (MRs) and M 1, M 2 and M 3 subtypes. The effects were brain region-, age- and gender-dependent. Some early-onset changes (weaning) persisted until puberty, while other alterations became manifest only at the advanced time point, when the brain levels of Hg, PCB 153, and PCB 126 had declined. The results of the combined exposure ruled out synergistic interactions between MeHg and PCB 153 or PCB 126 on every neurochemical endpoint tested. This applied to all pups regardless of the (i) regimen of exposure, (ii) gender, (iii) age, and (iv) brain area. The co-treatment with either PCB 153 or PCB 126 sometimes masked MeHg-induced changes on selected neurochemical endpoints. Nevertheless, this cannot be viewed as a protective effect.

This introduction summarizes the working group process and the four reports from the expert working group addressing: the use of positive controls, understanding variability, appropriate statistical techniques, and interpretation. The reports address the 1991 US Environmental Protection Agency standardized protocol for evaluation of <b>developmental</b> <b>neurotoxicity</b> (DNT) and the 2007 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Test Guidelines for DNT. The EPA protocol is comprised of tests for evidence of deficits in neurobehavioral function, including auditory startle habituation, motor activity, associative learning and memory, and neuropathologic examination, including simple morphometric analysis...|$|E
40|$|To protect {{public health}} the German Joint Working Group on Indoor Guidelines of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency and the States' Departments of Health is issuing indoor air {{guideline}} values {{based on a}} fixed procedure published in 1996 in the German Bundesgesundheitsblatt (39 : 422 - 426). Regarding dearomatized hydrocarbon solvents/white spirits (DAWS - CAS-No. 64742 - 47 - 8, 64742 - 48 - 9, 64742 - 88 - 7, 64741 - 65 - 7) no human data are available. From animal studies, <b>neurotoxicity,</b> <b>developmental</b> toxicity and reproductive toxicity were identified as critical endpoints. For risk evaluation the Hass et al. (2001) study {{was used as the}} pivotal study. Based on effects at 4680 mg DAWS/m 3 for the end point developmental toxicity, the lowest adverse effect level for chronic exposure is assessed as 400 mg DAWS/m 3. By applying an interspecies factor of 10, an intraspecies factor of 10 and an additional factor 2 referring to the special physiology of children (higher breath rate comp ared to adults) a so-called health hazard value of 2 mg DAWS/m 3 indoor air and a so-called health prevention value of 0. 2 mg DAWS/m 3 are obtained...|$|R
40|$|Bac k g r o u n d: The {{underlying}} genetic mechanisms {{specific to}} subtle neurological alterations associated with environmental lead (Pb) exposures {{have not been}} clearly elucidated. Objectives: The goal {{of this study was}} to identify novel gene targets and the underlying genetic mechanisms associated with <b>developmental</b> Pb <b>neurotoxicity.</b> Met h o d s: We first exposed zebrafish embryos to a range of Pb concentrations throughout early development to establish relative toxicity. Using the data from that experiment, we exposed another group of zebrafish embryos to a sublethal dose of Pb (100 ppb) immediately after fertilization through 72 or 120 hr postfertilization (hpf). Global gene expression was then analyzed for molecular pathways and gene ontology enrichment, and Western blot analysis was performed to investigate the translation of gene expression changes to protein levels. Res u l t s: After 72 hpf, we identified 231 probes representing 90 nonredundant genes with wellestablished function or orthology to human genes as being altered by Pb exposure. This gene set was both confirmatory and novel in nature and was highly enriched for neurological development, function, and disease. Moreover, gene changes at this time point were correlated to altered protein levels. Alternatively, the gene set at 120 hpf did not share association with neurological development. Con c l u s i o n s: Global gene expression alterations associated with developmental Pb exposure were dynamic and dependent on developmental stage. Gene expression alterations at the 72 ‑hpf time point were highly enriched with genes and molecular pathways associated with neurological development and disease. Moreover, we identified a number of novel targets for future exploration into their role in the genetic mechanisms underlying Pb-induced neurological alterations.

40|$|AbstractThe Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) {{concept has}} {{recently}} been proposed to support a paradigm shift in regulatory toxicology testing and risk assessment. This concept {{is similar to the}} Mode of Action (MOA), in that it describes a sequence of measurable key events triggered by a molecular initiating event in which a stressor interacts with a biological target. The resulting cascade of key events includes molecular, cellular, structural and functional changes in biological systems, resulting in a measurable adverse outcome. Thereby, an AOP ideally provides information relevant to chemical structure-activity relationships as a basis for predicting effects of structurally similar compounds. AOPs could potentially also form the basis for qualitative and quantitative predictive modeling of the human adverse outcome resulting from molecular initiating or other key events for which higher-throughput testing methods are available or can be developed. A variety of cellular and molecular processes are known to be critical for normal function of the central (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems (PNS). Because of the biological and functional complexity of the CNS and PNS, it has been challenging to establish causative links and quantitative relationships between key events that comprise the pathways leading from chemical exposure to an adverse outcome in the nervous system. Following introduction of the principles of MOA and AOPs, examples of potential or putative adverse outcome pathways specific for <b>developmental</b> or adult <b>neurotoxicity</b> are summarized and aspects of their assessment considered. Their possible application in developing mechanistically informed Integrated Approaches to Testing and Assessment (IATA) is also discussed...|$|R
