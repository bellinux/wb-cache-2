5|$|Although the {{majority}} of his works were in Polish, he tried his <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> several works in French language (Le roi de Landawa, Beatrice Cenci). Many of his works were published only posthumously, often under arbitrary titles, as Słowacki never named them himself. He also left notes on works that he never began or never completed. Słowacki is also considered the father of modern Polish drama.|$|E

5|$|Living {{alone in}} Mysore, Narayan {{developed}} {{an interest in}} agriculture. He bought an acre of agricultural land and tried his <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> farming. He was also prone to walking to the market every afternoon, {{not so much for}} buying things, but to interact with the people. In a typical afternoon stroll, he would stop every few steps to greet and converse with shopkeepers and others, most likely gathering material for his next book.|$|E

5|$|After the {{experience}} of assisting and acting in his cousin Aditya Chopra's directorial debut, the romance film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Karan Johar was encouraged to try his own <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> directing. With Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, he chose to pair up the same lead actors, Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, for his own romance film.

5|$|Following his {{resignation}} in 1926 to allow Margaret Bondfield {{to take a}} seat in Parliament, Hastings returned to {{his work as a}} barrister, and was even more successful than before his entry into the House of Commons. His cases included the Savidge Inquiry and the Royal Mail Case, and before his full retirement in 1948 {{he was one of the}} highest paid barristers at the English Bar. As well as his legal work, Hastings also tried his <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> writing plays. Although these had a mixed reception, The River was made into a silent film in 1927 named The Notorious Lady. Following strokes in 1948 and 1949, his activities became heavily restricted, and he died at home on 26 February 1952.|$|E

5|$|He practiced at the Bhiwani Boxing Club, where former national-level boxer and Jagdish Singh {{recognised}} his talent. Working part-time, he {{even tried}} his <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> modelling to financially support his coaching. The first recognition for Vijender {{came when he}} won a bout in the state level competition. Vijender won a silver medal in his first sub-junior nationals in 1997 {{and went on to}} bag his first gold medal at the 2000 Nationals. In 2003, he became the all-India youth boxing champion. The turning point, however, came in the 2003 Afro-Asian Games. Despite being a junior boxer, Vijender took part in the selection trials and was picked for the meet where he fought valiantly to win a silver medal.|$|E
5|$|His season's best {{came under}} unusual {{circumstances}} at the British Grand Prix – {{due to a}} system malfunction he was initially timed by <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> dead on ten seconds, which was amended to 9.96s after video evidence was consulted. He could not match that form at the World 100m final: Kim Collins, Darrel Brown, Darren Campbell, and Chambers all finished within a split second {{of each other and}} Chambers was adjudged to have finished fourth. Chambers squandered his anchoring lead in the 4×100m relay, allowing Joshua J. Johnson of the United States team to beat him to the finish line. In spite of his close fourth and a relay silver medal, {{there was a sense of}} disappointment in the press that Chambers' record breaking claims and gold medals had not materialised.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Miloš's {{descendant}} King Alexander visited Jovanović at his Vienna {{studio and}} requested {{a painting of}} the revolt to commemorate its 75th anniversary. With his rise in stature, the artist had found himself producing numerous replicas of his earlier Orientalist works. According to biographer Nikola Kusovac, Jovanović grew bored with painting replicas and considered taking up a different genre. Alexander's request presented Jovanović {{with an opportunity to}} deviate from Orientalism and try his <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> history painting. The Takovo Uprising was his first historical composition.|$|E

5|$|In Montenegro, Bond and Vesper {{meet their}} MI6 contact, René Mathis. Bond gains the upper <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> {{the start of}} the game. During a break, Obanno, infuriated, ambushes Le Chiffre in his suite. After Obanno leaves Le Chiffre's room, Bond engages him and {{strangles}} him to death. Vesper is traumatised by the encounter, but Bond comforts her. When the tournament resumes, Bond loses his initial stake, and Vesper refuses to fund further playing. Frustrated, Bond is about to kill Le Chiffre when he meets Felix Leiter, a fellow player and CIA agent who is on the same mission as Bond. Leiter, on the verge of losing, agrees to stake Bond on the condition that the CIA takes custody of Le Chiffre after his defeat.|$|E
5|$|In Ong Ah Chuan and the {{subsequent}} decision Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor (1981), the Privy Council declined to set out a comprehensive list of fundamental rules of natural justice and merely stated some principles {{to deal with the}} issues at <b>hand.</b> <b>At</b> a 2000 conference, the Attorney-General Chan Sek Keong, who became Chief Justice in 2006, remarked that this gives the Court of Appeal a free hand to determine the scope of the fundamental rules of natural justice unencumbered by precedent.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of sound cinema, among the various {{distinguished}} composers ready to try their <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> film music, Prokofiev was not an obvious choice for the commission. Based in Paris for almost a decade, he had a reputation for experimentation and dissonance, characteristics at odds with the cultural norms of the Soviet Union. By early 1933, however, Prokofiev was anxious to return to his homeland, and saw the film commission as an opportunity to write music in a more popular and accessible style.|$|E

Denard Robinson gained 192 yards of total offense against the Buckeyes, but left the game {{during the third}} quarter due to two dislocated fingers on his left <b>hand.</b> <b>At</b> {{the end of the}} regular season, Robinson had 1,643 rushing yards, which moved him into fifth place on U-M's all-time season rushing yardage list.

5|$|James and comedian Jimmy Kimmel co-{{hosted the}} 2007 ESPY Awards. In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd-season premiere of Saturday Night Live. He has also tried his <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> acting, {{appearing}} in a cameo {{role on the}} HBO series Entourage. In 2015, he played himself in the Judd Apatow film Trainwreck, receiving positive reviews for his performance. That same year, James' digital video company, Uninterrupted, raised $15.8 million from Warner Bros. Entertainment and Turner Sports to help expand the company's efforts to bring athlete-created content to fans. It is hosted on Bleacher Report and is used by several other athletes including New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski and Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy was {{admitted}} to the Massachusetts Bar in 1959. In 1960, his brother John ran for President of the United States and Ted managed his campaign in the Western states. Ted learned to fly and during the Democratic primary campaign he barnstormed around the western states, meeting with delegates and bonding with them by trying his <b>hand</b> <b>at</b> ski jumping and bronc riding. The seven weeks he spent in Wisconsin helped his brother win the first contested primary of the season there and a similar time spent in Wyoming was rewarded when a unanimous vote from that state's delegates put his brother over the top at the 1960 Democratic National Convention.|$|E
