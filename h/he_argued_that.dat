5|$|In 1865, the English {{economist}} William Stanley Jevons {{observed that}} technological improvements that increased {{the efficiency of}} coal-use led to the increased consumption of coal {{in a wide range}} of industries. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that,</b> contrary to common intuition, technological progress could not be relied upon to reduce fuel consumption.|$|E
5|$|In his High Court appeal Dietrich was {{represented}} by David Grace, QC. The main argument advanced on Dietrich's behalf was that his trial was a miscarriage of justice, since {{he did not have}} legal representation. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> he should have been provided with counsel at public expense, given the seriousness of the crime with which he was charged. Alternatively, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the judge should have stayed or adjourned the trial until he was able to obtain counsel himself. His argument was based on the common law tradition that an accused is entitled to a fair trial.|$|E
50|$|He {{says this}} because <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> our moral sense is {{composed}} of the narratives from which we draw conclusions, and by which we locate ourselves {{in relation to other}} people. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> because narrative is morality, the normative universe must rest on narrative. Since we also construct our view of the universe physically from narrative, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> the normative universe {{is as much a part}} of our existence as the physical universe.|$|R
50|$|Malcolm was {{the major}} African American thinker that {{influenced}} me in terms of nationalism and Pan-Africanism. As you know, towards the end, when Malcolm is expanding his concept of Islam, and of nationalism, he stresses Pan-Africanism in a particular way. And <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that,</b> {{and this is where}} we have the whole idea that cultural revolution and the need for revolution, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> we need a cultural revolution, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> we must return to Africa culturally and spiritually, even if we can’t go physically. And so that’s a tremendous impact on US.|$|R
50|$|Lippmann {{examines}} how, {{especially in}} an increasingly complex world, fear prevents society from addressing problems rationally. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> removing everyday concerns and fears will lead to greater rationality and boldness {{on the part of}} citizens. Invoking Freud, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> constructed fears unconsciously hold people and society back from achievement.|$|R
5|$|A limited {{operation}} {{was supported by}} Egyptian armed forces Chief of Staff Saad El Shazly. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Israel has two fatal weaknesses. The first of which is inability to sustain high human casualties due to limited available manpower. The second is inability to sustain a prolonged war for it mobilizes around 18% of the Jewish population. A prolonged limited defensive war can best capitalize both weaknesses.|$|E
5|$|After the Stuxnet attack, Kaspersky {{proposed}} that the Internet needed more regulation and policing. One idea was to have {{some parts of the}} Internet anonymous, while more secure areas require user identification. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> anonymity mostly benefited cybercriminals and hackers. For example, accessing a nuclear power plant network could require a verified identity through a digital passport.|$|E
5|$|As a Liberal MP he {{supported}} Irish Home Rule, trade unions, {{free trade and}} welfare reforms. Leading up to the First World War <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Britain should adopt a more sympathetic approach towards Germany, including naval disarmament. When war did break out, Brunner was resolute in the opinion {{that it should be}} fought and won. In addition to the production of alkali, his factories were making other chemicals for use as explosives. He also built a new factory to purify trinitrotoluene.|$|E

United States (1967), in which the Court held that warrantless wiretapping violated the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the Fourth Amendment only protected tangible items from physical searches or seizures. Thus, he concluded that telephone conversations were not within the scope of the amendment, and that warrantless wiretapping was consequently permissible.|$|E
5|$|By saying this, Kennedy was admonishing {{people not}} to riot in wake of King's death and in effect equating their actions {{to that of the}} civil rights leader's assassin. After quoting Abraham Lincoln, he portrayed the American public as a people {{increasingly}} succumbing to its violent tendencies that undermined its national ideals. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> all deaths degraded American society, thereby assuming an uncompromising stance that any and all acts of violence were unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|Christian Analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga criticized Malcolm's and Hartshorne's arguments, {{and offered}} an alternative. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that,</b> if Malcolm does prove the {{necessary}} {{existence of the}} greatest possible being, it follows {{that there is a}} being which exists in all worlds whose greatness in some worlds is not surpassed. It does not, he argued, demonstrate that such a being has unsurpassed greatness in this world.|$|E

50|$|Minds, Machines and Gödel is J. R. Lucas's 1959 {{philosophical}} {{paper in}} which <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> a human mathematician cannot be accurately represented by an algorithmic automaton.

5|$|Despite the evident {{conflicts}} between amateurism and the Soviet {{system in which}} athletes received stipends, jobs, and housing at state expense, Brundage took no action against the USSR or Warsaw Pact nations with similar systems; when challenged on this point, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Western nations had similar abuses, such as athletic scholarships. The Soviet system remained in place, though Western nations reacted by giving their athletes greater state support.|$|E
5|$|Espejo {{attacked}} Barreto's {{report in}} three ways. First, {{he claimed that}} Barreto, supposed author of the report, was not capable of writing it. Then <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the allegations were exaggerated semi-truths or outright lies. And finally he claimed that the economic problems of Quito could not be solved by exploiting its human resources (the Indians) but by planning and {{taking advantage of the}} natural resources of the region.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{wanted to}} {{maintain}} the threat of invasion by continuing air attacks on military targets in the British capital. Hans Jeschonnek still pushed for attacks on civilian morale. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> military and civilian industries were located too far apart to achieve a collapse of morale by attacking the former. Instead, he pressed for attacks against residential areas. Hitler refused. He ordered that only military targets in London were to be attacked.|$|E

50|$|Pilkington <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> economists do not {{actually}} {{understand what they}} are doing when they build economic models. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> this is because economists have no coherent epistemology. In order to ground economics in a proper epistemology and render it useful and clear he draws on the work of the philosophers George Berkeley and Immanuel Kant. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> economics should move away from models altogether and toward a form of schematism as outlined in the philosophy of Kant. <b>He</b> also <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> since economists deal with abstractions they must be careful {{in order to ensure that}} their theories remain close to reality.|$|R
50|$|Espen <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> it is {{a market}} failure that young people have more {{difficulties}} in accessing microfinance services than their ‘adult’ counterparts. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> young people are just as capable of maintaining and successfully repaying a loan as adults. Furthermore, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> the development return of investing in young people is very high, and that young people have important characteristics and attributes that can add value to the development process. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> as a consequence, the development community needs to ensure that young people and their needs are being included in any development programs in order to alleviate the market failure and thus optimize the positive impact that young people can have on economic and social development.|$|R
5|$|In 1912 the Reformist Party was founded, which {{attracted}} intellectuals. Figures {{like its}} leader, Alejandro Lerroux, helped attract wide {{support from the}} working class. His advocacy of anti-clericalism made him a successful demagogue in Barcelona. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the Catholic Church was inseparable from the system of oppression the people were under. It was around this time that republicanism came to the fore.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, W.D. Hamilton {{proposed}} a specific but widely applicable handicap mechanism, parasite-mediated sexual selection. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> in the never-ending co-evolutionary race between hosts and their parasites, sexually selected signals indicate health. This idea was tested in 1994 in barn swallows, a species where males have long tail streamers. Møller {{found that the}} males with longer tails, and their offspring, did have fewer bloodsucking mites, whereas fostered young did not. The effect was therefore genetic, confirming Hamilton's theory.|$|E
5|$|In Capitalism and Freedom, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{conscription}} is inequitable and arbitrary, preventing {{young men}} from shaping their lives as they see fit. During the Nixon administration he headed the committee to research a conversion to paid/volunteer armed force. He would later state that his role in eliminating the conscription in the United States was his proudest accomplishment. Friedman did, however, believe a nation could compel military training as a reserve in case of war time.|$|E

5|$|In {{his book}} The Technology Edge, {{published}} in 1983, O'Neill wrote about economic competition with Japan. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the United States {{had to develop}} six industries to compete: microengineering, robotics, genetic engineering, magnetic flight, family aircraft, and space science. He also thought that industrial development was suffering from short-sighted executives, self-interested unions, high taxes, and poor education of Americans. According to reviewer Henry Weil, O'Neill's detailed explanations of emerging technologies differentiated the book from others on the subject.|$|E
5|$|In his {{dissertation}} <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the iron ore near Clinton was a primary sediment; {{at the time}} the deposits were believed to be secondary nodules formed by replacement of primary limestone. His Princeton graduate student Hayes proved a similar result about the iron ores of his native Wabana, Newfoundland and Labrador. In 1919, Smyth showed that a green mineral in the Clinton ores was chamosite and also a primary sediment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the police}} commissioner's Annual Report for 1919, Curtis {{presented}} {{his view of}} the strike. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> he had not even needed the requested State Guards for the strike's first night because the city remained quiet and he had reports that many policemen would not join the strike. By {{the end of the year}} the strikers had formed a new organization called the Association of Former Police of the City of Boston.|$|E
5000|$|Toynbee <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> civilizations {{are born}} out of more {{primitive}} societies, not {{as the result of}} racial or environmental factors, but as a response to challenges, such as hard country, new ground, blows and pressures from other civilizations, and penalization. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> for civilizations to be born, the challenge must be a golden mean; that excessive challenge will crush the civilization, and too little challenge will cause it to stagnate. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> civilizations continue to grow only when they meet one challenge only to be met by another, in a continuous cycle of [...] "Challenge and Response". <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> civilizations develop in different ways due to their different environments and different approaches to the challenges they face. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> growth is driven by [...] "Creative Minorities": those who find solutions to the challenges, who inspire (rather than compel) others to follow their innovative lead. This is done through the [...] "faculty of mimesis." [...] Creative minorities find solutions to the challenges a civilization faces, while the great mass follow these solutions by imitation, solutions they otherwise would be incapable of discovering on their own.|$|R
