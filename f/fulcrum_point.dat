50|$|Tweezers {{make use}} of two third-class levers {{connected}} at one fixed end (the <b>fulcrum</b> <b>point</b> of each lever), with the pincers at the others.|$|E
50|$|Sherman {{released}} his first album, <b>Fulcrum</b> <b>Point</b> featuring Marc Gould, Delmar Brown, Rael Wesley Grant and Kenwood Denard, on Unisphere records in 1980. This recording {{turned out to}} be an unknown fusion classic.|$|E
50|$|The power {{afforded to}} the inner mallets allows the player to utilize all four mallets when playing melodies, rather than just two leading mallets. This is {{achieved}} by smoothly transitioning between the two <b>fulcrum</b> <b>points</b> and various spreads to use each mallet comfortably and efficiently.|$|R
50|$|Assuming {{the lever}} does not {{dissipate}} or store energy, the power into the lever must equal the power {{out of the}} lever. As the lever rotates around the <b>fulcrum,</b> <b>points</b> farther from this pivot move faster than points closer to the pivot. Therefore, a force applied to a point farther from the pivot must be less than the force located at a point closer in, because power {{is the product of}} force and velocity.|$|R
50|$|Friction-disc {{clutches}} {{generally are}} classified as push type or pull type depending on {{the location of the}} pressure plate <b>fulcrum</b> <b>points.</b> In a pull-type clutch, the action of pressing the pedal pulls the release bearing, pulling on the diaphragm spring and disengaging the vehicle drive. The opposite is true with a push type, the release bearing is pushed into the clutch disengaging the vehicle drive. In this instance, the release bearing can be known as a thrust bearing (as per the image above).|$|R
50|$|A {{contrast}} between this design and other successful bolt {{actions of the}} time, such as the Mausers and US Springfield, is the rear locking lug. This puts the lug close to the bolt handle, where the pressure is applied by the operator; in essence the force {{is close to the}} <b>fulcrum</b> <b>point.</b> Without great explanation, this results in an easier and swifter operation versus the Mauser design, resulting in a greater rate of fire. However, the sacrifice is strength as the <b>fulcrum</b> <b>point</b> has moved away from the force of the explosion, thus making the length of the bolt a lever working against the holding power of the rear lug. This was a limiting factor in the ballistics capacity of this design.|$|E
50|$|A {{program for}} brass and {{percussion}} players from Youth Symphony and Philharmonia. The Brass Choir performs {{in all three}} EYSO season concerts, as well as presenting its own spring concert and masterclass, featuring prominent brass guest artists such as <b>Fulcrum</b> <b>Point</b> New Music Ensemble and the Wisconsin Brass Quintet.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, Vivian {{traveled}} to Southwest China for ethno-musicological research to study minority music and {{cultures in the}} Yunnan province. It was {{a continuation of the}} research that previously inspired 'Yunnan Folk Songs' (2011). The project was commissioned by <b>Fulcrum</b> <b>Point</b> New Music in Chicago with support from the MAP Fund.|$|E
50|$|Another type of tremolo is the locking tremolo. These bridges {{have a sort}} of vise in each saddle which clamps {{the string}} into place (usually with an Allen key). The end of the string has a clamp, which holds the string in place, {{stopping}} it from slipping. It is especially useful for songs that require tapping or heavy/hard playing styles. Once set up for tuning stability, locking tremolos are very good. However, their <b>fulcrum</b> <b>points</b> offer extremely minute contact with the body, which may disturb sound transfer.|$|R
5000|$|The {{stroke of}} each mallet in this grip {{utilizes}} a vertical motion, with the mallet acting {{as an extension}} of the forearm. This eliminates the supinated, rotating motion of the forearm used by many four-mallet players which can lead to wrist, elbow, and arm injuries. Because of the looseness of the grip, the mallets are commonly wrapped with tape to increase friction and diameter size. This also helps to reduce clicking sounds between the sticks.Two <b>fulcrum</b> <b>points</b> are used, each relating to a mallet interval spread: [...] "small to mid-range" [...] and [...] "mid-range to large.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The lever is a movable {{bar that}} pivots on a [...] {{attached}} to or positioned on or across a fixed point. The lever operates by applying forces at different distances from the fulcrum, or pivot. As the lever pivots on the <b>fulcrum,</b> <b>points</b> farther from this pivot move faster than points {{closer to the}} pivot. The power {{into and out of}} the lever is the same, so must come out the same when calculations are being done. Power is the product of force and velocity, so forces applied to points farther from the pivot must be less than when applied to points closer in.|$|R
50|$|Chicago {{also has}} a {{thriving}} and youthful contemporary classical scene. Major venues for new music include concerts by the International Contemporary Ensemble, Ensemble Dal Niente, Third Coast Percussion, <b>Fulcrum</b> <b>Point</b> and the CSO's MusicNOW series. Composers of note include Augusta Read Thomas, Lee Hyla, Marcos Balter, Kirsten Broberg, Hans Thomalla, Jay Alan Yim and Shulamit Ran.|$|E

5000|$|Haque {{wrote the}} [...] "Lahara Double Concerto" [...] for guitar, sitar, and tabla. He {{performed}} it in 2004 with the Chicago Sinfonietta and tabla musician Ustad Zakir Hussain. He composed the [...] "Gamelan Concerto" [...] as a commissioned classical guitar {{piece for the}} <b>Fulcrum</b> <b>Point</b> Ensemble. With the Chicago Philharmonic he gave a concert in which he performed both the Villa Lobos and Aranjuez guitar concertos.|$|E

50|$|This {{equation}} {{shows that}} if the distance a from the <b>fulcrum</b> to the <b>point</b> A where the input force is applied {{is greater than the}} distance b from <b>fulcrum</b> to the <b>point</b> B where the output force is applied, then the lever amplifies the input force. If the opposite is true that the distance from the fulcrum to the input point A is less than from the fulcrum to the output point B, then the lever reduces the magnitude of the input force.|$|R
40|$|The Cambrian ‘explosion’ {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the <b>fulcrum</b> <b>points</b> in the history of life, yet its origins and causes remain deeply controversial. New data from the fossil record, especially of Burgess Shale-type Lagerstätten, indicate, however, that the assembly of bodyplans is not only largely a Cambrian phenomenon, but can already be documented in fair detail. This speaks against a much more ancient origin of the metazoans, and current work is doing much to reconcile the apparent discrepancies between the fossil record, including the Ediacaran assemblages of latest Neoproterozoic age and molecular ‘clocks’. Hypotheses to explain the Cambrian ‘explosion’ continue to be generated, but the recurrent confusion of cause and effect suggests that the wrong sort of question is being asked. Here I propose that despite its step-like function this evolutionary event is the inevitable consequence of Earth and biospheric change...|$|R
50|$|A {{rotation}} flap is a semicircular {{skin flap}} that is rotated into the defect on a <b>fulcrum</b> <b>point.</b> Rotation flaps provide {{the ability to}} mobilize large areas of tissue with a wide vascular base for reconstruction. The flap must be adequately large, and a large base is necessary if a back-cut {{will be needed to}} lengthen the flap. If the flap is too small, the residual defect can be covered by mobilizing the surrounding tissue.|$|E
50|$|The {{freehand}} {{technique is}} a unique method used by percussion to produce a fast drum roll with a single hand. It is based around using the rim of a snare drum as the <b>fulcrum</b> <b>point</b> of the drumstick. By doing this, a drummer can produce two strikes of the drum with each full motion (one on the down stroke, {{and one on the}} upstroke). The technique is also known amongst many drummers as the gravity blast.|$|E

5000|$|If one {{consciously}} locks their wrist, elbow, {{and shoulder}} {{so that they}} remain stationary, the only degree of freedom left to move the stick is the finger lever. The <b>fulcrum,</b> or <b>point</b> of rotation, will be located approximately where the pad of the thumb meets the stick. The thumb acts as the fulcrum while the other 4 fingers can apply mechanical forces to the stick.|$|R
5000|$|Geoffrey Gordon's list {{of works}} {{includes}} orchestral and chamber music—vocal and instrumental—as well as scores for theater, dance and film. His {{music has been}} called [...] "darkly seductive" [...] (The New York Times), “brilliant” (Boston Globe), “stunning” (Milwaukee Journal), “wonderfully idiomatic” (Salt Lake Tribune), “haunting” (Strings Magazine) and “remarkable” (Fanfare). Chicago Tribune music critic John von Rhein called Mr. Gordon’s lux solis aeterna, premiered by the acclaimed <b>Fulcrum</b> <b>Point</b> New Music Project, “a cosmic beauty … of acutely crafted music.” And music critic Lawrence Johnson, of Classical Review, called Mr. Gordon’s work Tiger Psalms, “a very impressive and significant world premiere … the composer makes the music sing magnificently.” ...|$|E

John Von Rhein of the Chicago Tribune called the festival “an ambitious, eclectic, barrier-blasting, uneven, ultimately wonderful cornucopia of Beethoveniana” [...] and Mia Clarke of Time Out Chicago called it “the unexpected smash of the season!" [...] and [...] "Chicago’s hippest and most inclusive classical festival to date." ...|$|E
50|$|Most {{prevalent}} work {{principle for}} CSH is Bell Crank Mechanism. The Bell crank lever rotates around the <b>Fulcrum</b> <b>point.</b> One {{end of the}} Bell crank lever {{is connected to the}} pipe ‘P’, the other end is connected to the spring by the tie rod. Thus when the pipe moves down from cold to hot condition, the point P moves down, and as it moves down the Bell crank lever will rotate in the anti clock wise direction & tie rod connected to the spring will be pulled in, by which the spring gets further compressed. When the pipe moves up the bell crank lever will rotate (in the clock wise direction) & the tie rod connected to spring will be pushed out thus allowing the spring to expand or relax.|$|E

40|$|Beverly Massachusetts {{is a small}} City {{with wide}} income {{disparity}} and prohibitive housing costs. The dramatic rise in housing prices over the last 5 - 10 years has {{made it impossible for}} low-income people to purchase homes. The Homeownership Continuum is an attempt at melding new and existing resources to leverage homeownership opportunities for low -income people. The HC provides low-income families with a viable path toward homeownership by addressing each barrier to ownership with pertinent resources. Financial limitations are addressed by the establishment of the Section 8 Mortgage program, the creation of an IDA savings program and the application of existing down payment programs. Limited understanding about credit, basic finance and mortgage processes is dealt with through educational workshops and targeted marketing. The IDA program will offer monthly workshops on these topics. A certified homebuyer class will be offered by the Community Outreach Program in conjunction with a local realtor and local bankers. In addition, information regarding existing first-time buyer programs will be distributed in low-moderate income neighborhoods. Finally, the local affordable housing developers will commit to considering first-time buyer projects as part of their efforts to address the affordable housing shortage. All these <b>fulcrum</b> <b>points</b> are necessary to leverage first time buyer opportunities for low and moderate income families. (Author abstract) DeFranza, A. (2004). Homeownership continuum.

50|$|The Cembalet is an {{electro-mechanical}} piano requiring amplification {{to produce}} a usable sound level. Cembalets have 61 keys and a keyboard range of C2 to C7 (65.4 Hz - 2093 Hz). The Cembalet had ground stainless steel reeds and a pick-up using variable capacitance. The keyboard action is very simple. Each key is a single lever element pivoted on a <b>fulcrum</b> <b>point</b> with a spring to {{return it to the}} rest position. The key is extended at the rear so that a plectrum and damper pad can be mounted {{at the end of a}} tuned spring steel reed. This plectrum lifts and releases the reed causing it to vibrate when the key is depressed. The vibration of the reed is converted to an electrical signal by a pick-up. The unique playing feel of a Cembalet comes from the resistance of the steel reeds until they reach their point of release.|$|E
50|$|The Pianet is an {{electro-mechanical}} piano requiring amplification {{to produce}} a usable sound level. Pianets in {{the first group of}} models have 61 keys and a keyboard range of F1 to F6 (43.6 Hz - 1396.9 Hz). The second group have 60 keys and finish at E6 (1318.5 Hz). The keyboard action is very simple. Each key is a single lever element pivoted on a <b>fulcrum</b> <b>point</b> with a spring to return it to the rest position. The key is extended at the rear so that a pad can be mounted over a tuned spring steel reed. This pad adheres to the reed when at rest, and lifts and releases the reed causing it to vibrate when the key is depressed. The vibration of the reed is converted to an electrical signal by a pick-up. The unique playing feel of a Pianet comes from the activation pads adhering to the steel reeds until they reach their point of release.|$|E
5000|$|In 1989, Amsallem's {{composition}} [...] "Obstinated" [...] {{was performed}} by the Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra, {{now known as the}} Vanguard Jazz Orchestra. He has since written, conducted and recorded big band music for the Köln Radio Jazz Orchestra (WDR), the Orchestre National de jazz (France), chamber cross-over music for the Prism Saxophone Quartet, Chicago's chamber ensemble <b>Fulcrum</b> <b>Point,</b> and cross-over symphonic pieces as well as big band music for the Mancini Institute. He has taught or given workshops at Roosevelt University, New York's 92Y, Paris' CNSM, CRR, the Royal conservatory in Den Haag, and in many other countries. His 1990 recording debut, Out a Day, featuring Gary Peacock on bass and Bill Stewart on drums, was produced at the Clinton Recording Studios in Manhattan. The album was reviewed by the Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings, which gave it four stars (maximum rating). To date, he has recorded a total of 10 albums under his name.|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} of the {{mitral valve}} apparatus was assessed on 100 normal left ventriculograms. Four distinct types of mitral valve were identified {{according to the}} position of the mitral <b>fulcrum</b> (the <b>point</b> of attachment of the leaflets to the annulus) and the configuration of the adjacent left ventricular wall (left ventricular fornix) during diastole. Types I and II closely simulated prolapse of the mitral valve (pseudoprolapse) in the right anterior oblique projection during the ejection period. Measurements showed that contraction of the ventricle failed to reduce the diameter of the mitral valve annulus in 26 per cent of normal left ventricles...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanics}} of a beam balance are little appreciated and seldom understood. We here consider {{the conditions that}} result in a stable balance, with center of gravity below the <b>fulcrum</b> (pivot <b>point),</b> while an unstable balance results when {{the center of gravity}} is above the fulcrum. The highly sensitive drinking-straw microbalance, which uses a plastic drinking straw as a rigid beam, is briefly described with some slight convenient modifications. Different placements of the center of gravity are considered analytically to explain the equilibrium neutrality, stability, and instability of such beam balances as the microbalance, the playground “seesaw” or “teeter-totter,” the “dipping bird,” and other toys and magic tricks...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>fulcrum</b> is the <b>point</b> {{of balance}} in a pivot. Fulcrum chose this name because {{it seeks to}} renew the evangelical {{tradition}} at {{the centre of the}} Church of England. According to its website, [...] "Fulcrum embraces an historic orthodoxy that is generous in spirit, confident in the contribution evangelicals can make to Anglicanism". In the current climate of uncertainty in the Anglican Communion, Fulcrum seeks to promote an unpolarised evangelicalism.|$|R
