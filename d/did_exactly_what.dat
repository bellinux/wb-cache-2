5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Harwich Force sortied {{on the night}} of 23–24 October in {{response}} to the German transfer of two flotillas of torpedo boats to Zeebrugge, in occupied Belgium, but failed to make contact with the German ships. The Admiralty ordered Tyrwhitt to detach Carysfort and four destroyers to reinforce Vice-Admiral Reginald Bacon's Dover Patrol as they feared that the transfer was in preparation for a concerted attack on the shipping protected by the latter. Three nights later, the newly arrived German destroyers <b>did</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the Admiralty feared and attacked. Carysfort played no role in the resulting action, but was kept in reserve and helped to search for damaged vessels the following morning. German destroyers made another attack {{on the night of}} 20/21 April 1917 and were driven off, losing two destroyers, without the cruiser's intervention.|$|E
25|$|When {{only four}} fresh eggs were {{available}} one morning at a London hotel, he awarded {{them to the}} bowlers because Lancashire {{were likely to be}} fielding all day. His team respected and liked him, and he <b>did</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> an amateur should: he declared boldly to give the opposition a chance and his bowlers time to take their wickets. The crowds returned to Old Trafford, and the team were slightly unlucky to finish only third.|$|E
25|$|The system <b>did</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> {{had been}} asked of it; it {{provided}} very accurate range measurements {{on the order of}} 50yards. However, in the field it became clear that this was simply not enough. By late 1939 the spectre of night bombing was a major concern, and as the GL system could not provide accurate bearing information, and no elevation, it was unable to direct the guns at night. Instead the World War I style of operation was used, with searchlights hunting for targets largely at random, and conventional optical instruments being used to determine bearing and elevation once a target was lit up.|$|E

500|$|There was a {{negative}} fan {{reaction to the}} design of Enterprise, and criticism of the efforts of Drexler and the other designers. When questioned about this, Geoffrey Mandall stated in an interview, [...] "Having been around then, I also know that Doug Drexler and John Eaves <b>did</b> <b>EXACTLY</b> <b>what</b> the producers asked them to: Rick and Braga had very strong opinions, and knew exactly what they wanted." ...|$|E
500|$|Once again, the {{selection}} {{and management of the}} Australian team to tour England in 1909 caused friction between leading players and the Board of Control. [...] Clem Hill, unwilling to tour on the terms offered by the Board, withdrew his name from consideration. [...] Regardless, the tour was a success, both for the Australians, who won the series two-one, and for Armstrong, who made 1,451runs at an average of just under 44 and took 133wickets at an average of 16.40 [...] Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described his role in the tour as [...] "to keep the side together by means of his impregnable defence, and he <b>did</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> was required, only on rare occasions giving free play to his hitting power. [...] When he likes to let himself loose there is no harder driver in the world".|$|E
500|$|This {{proved a}} {{tactical}} blunder: when a British army under General John Burgoyne arrived in July 1777, Burgoyne <b>did</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> Kościuszko had warned of {{and had his}} engineers place artillery on the hill. With the British in complete control of the high ground, the Americans realized their situation was hopeless and abandoned the fortress with hardly a shot fired in the Siege of Ticonderoga. The British advance force nipped hard {{on the heels of}} the outnumbered and exhausted Continentals as they fled south. Major General Philip Schuyler, desperate to put distance between his men and their pursuers, ordered Kościuszko to delay the enemy. [...] Kościuszko designed an engineer's solution: his men felled trees, dammed streams, and destroyed bridges and causeways. Encumbered by their huge supply train, the British began to bog down, giving the Americans the time needed to safely withdraw across the Hudson River.|$|E

500|$|Julia Glum, in {{an article}} in the International Business Times, wrote that the [...] "mascot for the Olympic Games is almost always strange-looking, and Rio de Janeiro is no exception. ... though they're by far not the craziest Olympic animals to ever exist ..." [...] In an article {{published}} by Mic, Brianna Provenzano referred to the mascots as [...] "lovable", describing their appearance as [...] "sweet and simple" [...] and highlighting their symbolisms for the animals and plants of Brazil. However, Charlotte Wilder, a writer on USA Todays sports column For The Win, was unimpressed by Vinicius's design, stating, [...] "Whoever was in charge of coming up with this creature of the huge hands and feet <b>did</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> it looks like, which is mash up a bunch of animals, video game characters, and cartoons, stuff it with some synthetic filling, and call it day." [...] Robert John Young, Professor of Wildlife Conservation at the University of Salford, criticized Rio 2016 for failing to capitalize on environmental protection by [...] "inventing" [...] mascots, rather than using actual animal species. Young also criticized the organizers for not offering a female name in the public vote.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} studies focused on the {{allegation}} that law enforcement favored Jews over African Americans, including one that refuted the allegation. An interview with Rabbi Shmuel Butman, published in 1991, mentions a police directive to Hatzolah to transport Lifsch, along with Jews already injured by rioters, without transporting either of the Cato children. [...] "We <b>did</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the police officers wisely advised us." ...|$|E
