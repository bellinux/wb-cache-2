[...] The SI unit of particle displacement is the metre (m). In most cases this is a longitudinal wave of pressure (such as sound), {{but it can also}} be a transverse wave, such as the vibration of a taut string. In the case of a sound wave travelling through air, the particle displacement is evident in the oscillations of air molecules with, and against, the direction in which the sound wave is travelling.|$|E

40|$|The higher-order {{acoustic}} nonlinear {{parameters are}} considered effective damage indices {{in the field}} of nondestructive evaluation (NDE). They are defined by using the <b>displacement</b> <b>amplitudes</b> of the fundamental frequency and the harmonics, which are called the absolute nonlinear parameters. Generally, however, it is difficult to measure the very small <b>displacement</b> <b>amplitudes</b> of high-frequency harmonics. Therefore, the simplified parameters using the detected wave signal amplitudes, which are known as the relative nonlinear parameters, have been widely used, although their applications are limited to the relative comparison of before and after damage of a single material under consistent experimental circumstances. In this paper, in order to make clear the concept of relative parameter, we presented first that the relative ratio of the simplified parameters is identical to that of the absolute parameters when the detected signal amplitudes are linearly proportional to the actual <b>displacement</b> <b>amplitudes</b> with respect to the fundamental frequency and the harmonics. In addition, the new relationship between the relative ratio of simplified second-order parameter and the relative ratio of simplified third-order parameter was derived from the relationship between the absolute second-and third-order parameters. This new relationship was successfully verified based on experimental results obtained from Al 6061 -T 6 processed for different heat treatment times, where it was confirmed in advance that the PZT detection signal amplitudes at the fundamental frequency and its second-and third-order harmonics were linearly proportional to the <b>displacement</b> <b>amplitudes.</b> (C) 2014 Elsevier B.

The free reed of the harmonium is riveted from a metal frame and is subjected to airflow, which is pumped from the bellows through the reservoir, pushing the reed and bringing it to self-exciting oscillation and to sound production {{in the direction of}} airflow. This particular aerodynamics is nonlinear in that the maximum <b>displacement</b> <b>amplitude</b> in which the reed can vibrate is limited by fluctuations in damping forces, so that the resultant sound pressure is rather constant.

So the specific acoustic impedance of water is 3,500 times higher than that of air. This means that a sound in water with a given pressure amplitude is 3,500 times less intense than one in air with the same pressure. This is because the air, with its lower z0, moves with a much greater velocity and <b>displacement</b> <b>amplitude</b> than does water. Reciprocally, if a sound in water and another in air have the same intensity, then the pressure is much smaller in air. These variations lead to important differences between room acoustics or atmospheric acoustics on the one hand, and underwater acoustics on the other.|$|E

The device is necessary because the amplitudes provided by the transducers themselves are insufficient for most practical applications of power ultrasound. Another function of the ultrasonic horn is to efficiently transfer the acoustic energy from the ultrasonic transducer into the treated media, which may be solid (for example, in ultrasonic welding, ultrasonic cutting or ultrasonic soldering) or liquid (for example, in ultrasonic homogenization, sonochemistry, milling, emulsification, spraying or cell disruption). Ultrasonic processing of liquids relies of intense shear forces and extreme local conditions (temperatures up to 5000 K and pressures up to 1000 atm) generated by acoustic cavitation.|$|E
40|$|Most primary {{accelerometer}} calibrations, or absolute calibrations, {{are currently}} performed using laser interferometry under the guideline {{of the international}} standard (ISO 16063 - 11, 1999). Due to rocking motion of vibration shakers, however, the measured accelerometer sensitivities at different laser incidence points can vary {{for up to a}} few percent. For the accurate determination of rocking motion on the effect of calibration results, a dual-beam laser interferometer was developed at National Research Council Canada. This paper describes the method and apparatus for simultaneous measurements of <b>displacement</b> <b>amplitudes</b> and its distribution along a straight line using a dual-beam laser interferometer. The interferometer directs two beams that are incident at distinct points on a moving surface. A separation distance between the two sensing spots on the moving surface is provided. In the present setup, the separation distance is adjustable along a straight line. This feature allows the interferometer to measure the displacement distribution along a line. To reduce the measurement uncertainty a model-based estimation is used to accurately determine the <b>displacement</b> <b>amplitudes</b> from the current outputs of photo diodes. This paper also presents the measurement results showing the difference of <b>displacement</b> <b>amplitudes</b> due to rocking motion.

40|$|Two methods {{based upon}} the {{digitized}} modulation phase of a single channel laser interference photo signal are derived to compute the <b>displacement</b> <b>amplitude</b> of an accelerometer. One is an analytical method that can easily calculate the <b>displacement</b> <b>amplitude</b> of an accelerometer from digitized modulation phase by simple algebraic equations as long as these modulation phases {{are in the same}} 2 u argument and the signal is noise free. The other method is using least squares to curve fit the digitized modulation phases ofa laser interference signal with noise. The advantages of these methods are that, without changing any experimental setup, one can use the existing primary calibration laser interferometer system that follows the ISO 16063 - 1 1 and the phase mismatch and amplitude mismatch of a two-beam laser system can be avoided.

The overall results of waveform simulation analysis allow the conclusion that this inversion approach is reliable in retrieving the geometrical aspects of the seismic source. Inversions for the pure-shear mechanism and a general mechanism, including a tensile component, are shown to be robust for various wave-type solutions, under reduced array coverage, hypocentral mislocation, and the addition of Gaussian normally distributed noise.
