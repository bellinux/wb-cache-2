5|$|By 1972, Diefenbaker {{had grown}} disillusioned with Trudeau, and campaigned wholeheartedly for the Tories in that year's election. Diefenbaker was reelected comfortably {{in his home}} riding, and the Progressive Conservatives came within two seats of {{matching}} the Liberal total. Diefenbaker was relieved both that Trudeau had been humbled and that Stanfield <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>denied</b> power. Trudeau regained his majority two years later in an election that saw Diefenbaker, by then the only living former Prime Minister, have his personal majority grow to 11,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|Chinese-American cook Wong Kim Ark, who {{was born}} in San Francisco in 1873, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>denied</b> {{re-entry}} to the United States after a trip abroad, under a law restricting Chinese immigration and prohibiting immigrants from China (the Great Qing) from becoming naturalized U.S. citizens. He challenged the government's refusal to recognize his citizenship, and the Supreme Court ruled in his favor, holding that the citizenship language in the Fourteenth Amendment encompassed the circumstances of his birth and could not be limited in its effect by an act of Congress.|$|E

5|$|The {{mandate of}} the OSCE mission in Georgia expired on 1 January 2009, after Russia vetoed its extension. OSCE {{monitors}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>denied</b> access to South Ossetia since the war. The {{mandate of the}} UNOMIG expired on 16 June 2009; its extension was also vetoed by Russia, which argued that the mandate did not properly reflect Russia's position of recognising Abkhazia as an independent state. According to UN mission head Johan Verbeke, about 60,000 ethnic Georgians in Abkhazia became vulnerable after the mission's end.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech and Auburn each earned {{automatic}} {{spots in}} a BCS bowl game {{due to their}} status as conference champions, and were selected by the 2005 Sugar Bowl. Virginia Tech finished the season 10–2 and was named ACC football champion its first year in the conference. Auburn, meanwhile, finished the season undefeated at 12–0, and was named champion of the SEC. Controversy erupted around Auburn's selection, as the Tigers <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>denied</b> {{a spot in the}} national championship game in favor of two other undefeated teams: the University of Southern California (USC) and Oklahoma.|$|E
5|$|While the Beatles were there, the Maharishi was {{negotiating}} with the Indian government to use some nearby parkland for an airstrip for a plane {{which he had been}} given; a deal which several thousand landless peasants objected to as they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>denied</b> the use of the land for farming. The ashram was surrounded by barbed wire and the gates were kept locked and guarded. While the Maharishi kept the media away from his famous students, he himself gave interviews to the press.|$|E

5|$|After her graduation, Simone {{spent the}} summer of 1950 at the Juilliard School, as a student of Carl Friedberg, {{preparing}} for an audition at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. Her application, however, was denied. As her family had relocated to Philadelphia in the expectation of her entry to Curtis, the blow to her aspirations was particularly heavy, and she suspected that her application <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>denied</b> because of racial prejudice. Discouraged, she took private piano lessons with Vladimir Sokoloff, a professor at Curtis, but never re-applied to the institution. She {{took a job as}} a photographer's assistant, but also found work as an accompanist at Arlene Smith's vocal studio and taught piano from her home in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|During Willis's term, state revenue {{increased}} {{because of}} to wartime inflation, increased federal money, {{and the relative}} prosperity of the state's economy. The state budget was $31 million when Willis took office; {{by the time he}} left office, it had expanded to $52 million. Much of these funds were devoted to education. Expenditures per pupil nearly doubled, as did teacher salaries. The school year was lengthened from seven to eight months. Counties were also allowed to double their school tax rate. He created a Commission on Negro Affairs, appointed the first African-American to the state Board of Education, and increased state aid to pay out-of-state tuition to minorities who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>denied</b> admission to professional programs in the state universities.|$|E
5|$|On 28 December 1263 Henry {{left for}} France {{to present his}} case to King Louis. Montfort was {{prevented}} from attending by an accident, and he was represented by Peter de Montfort and others. Henry had already tried once before, in September, {{to appeal to the}} French king. That time Louis had been sympathetic to Henry's cause, but decided in favour of maintaining the provisions. At Amiens Henry argued that his right to appoint his own ministers and officials <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>denied</b> him, in violation of the royal prerogative. He also accused his opponents of destroying royal castles and laying waste to royal lands. For his injuries he demanded a compensation of the barons of £300,000 and 200,000 marks. Referring to the papal writ of annulment, Henry asked the French king to free him from observing the provisions forced upon him by the barons.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 20 June, two armed Protestant corps coming from Montbéliard and Neuchâtel were {{travelling}} to Besançon. However, some of the troops from the Neuchâtel group decided to abandon the battle, as their request for extra pay <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>denied.</b> The other soldiers continued upstream. The remaining soldiers from Neuchâtel {{got into a fight}} with the inhabitants of Morteau; after a fierce battle, they were forced to retreat. After waiting for the group from Neuchâtel, which could not be found, Capitaine Paul de Beaujeu decided to continue with the plan. By midnight, the soldiers had reached Palente, and they hid in the forests of Chalezeule while establishing a plan of attack. With the help of a dozen small boats laid end-to-end, the soldiers crossed the Doubs. To continue the attack, the soldiers would need the help of the townspeople.|$|E
5|$|Since {{free speech}} may be {{exercised}} during assemblies and gatherings, Article 14(1)(b) of the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of assembly, is relevant. Prior to October 2009, the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act ("PEMA") required a licence to {{be obtained from}} the Public Entertainments Licensing Unit (PELU) of the Singapore Police Force before talks, discussions or similar events open to the public were held. Holding an event without a licence would result in a fine or imprisonment. Members of opposition parties claimed that PELU acted inconsistently in issuing licences, and that they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>denied</b> licences without reason. The Workers' Party was fined $800 after a dinner event in 1986, at which the Party's Secretary-General J.B. Jeyaretnam had given a speech. PELU decreed that since the publicly delivered speech had been unrelated to the festivities, a separate licence from the dinner itself was needed. In addition, the Act exempted public entertainments provided by or {{under the auspices of the}} Government, thus allowing MPs from the ruling PAP to speak without a licence in their capacity as grassroots advisors.|$|E
5|$|The Senators' owners {{decided to}} move the {{franchise}} to St. Louis, Missouri, and the transfer {{was approved by the}} league on May 14, 1934. Thomas Franklin Ahearn resigned as president of the Ottawa Auditorium and Redmond Quain became president. Quain transferred the players' contracts and franchise operations to a new company called the Hockey Association of St. Louis, Inc. Eddie Gerard was hired to coach the new team. The club was renamed the Eagles, inspired by the logo of the Anheuser-Busch brewing company, which was founded in St. Louis. The Senators name and logo remained in Ottawa and would be used by a senior amateur team until 1954. At the time, St. Louis was the seventh largest city in the United States, with over 800,000 inhabitants— over seven times larger than Ottawa. Despite this, St. Louis <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>denied</b> an NHL franchise in 1932 because travel to the Midwest was considered too expensive during the Great Depression.|$|E

5|$|The Veterans Administration (VA), {{charged with}} {{implementing}} {{the provisions of}} the G.I. Bill, denied benefits to blue-discharge veterans, despite the Bill's explicit language that made only a dishonorable discharge grounds for denying benefits to a veteran. In 1945, the VA issued a directive that all blue-discharges for homosexuality would be denied benefits. On December 22, 1955, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an appeal from Raymond W. Longernecker, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>denied</b> his G.I. Bill benefits by the VA because of his blue discharge. The Court found that the VA had discretion in awarding benefits and that Congress had specifically foreclosed the courts from overruling it. Nevertheless, the Court noted that the denial of benefits should only have occurred if Longernecker had been dishonorably discharged and that the VA Administrator was acting without authority in treating a blue discharge as if it were dishonorable.|$|E
5|$|After withdrawing, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau rendezvoused with Nürnberg and Titania at Nuku Hiva, {{where they}} resupplied and their crews took shore leave {{before moving on}} to meet the rest of the {{squadron}} at Easter Island. Although the Germans had destroyed the shipping at Papeete and wreaked havoc in the town, they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>denied</b> their primary objective of seizing the French coal piles and replenishing their own stocks. Von Spee's raid allowed the British Admiralty to receive word on his position and heading, allowing them to inform Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock of the German intentions thus leading to the Battle of Coronel. Another effect was the reduction of ammunition available to the two German cruisers. The hundreds of shells fired by von Spee's ships at Papeete were irreplaceable. The depletion of ammunition {{as a result of the}} action at Papeete contributed to the German East Asia Squadron's failure to adequately defend itself at the Battle of the Falkland Islands against British battlecruisers. Lieutenant Destremau was chastised by his misinformed superior officer for his actions during the defense of Papeete and for the loss of the gunboat Zélée. He was summoned back to Toulon under arrest to be court-martialled, but died of illness in 1915 before the trial. In 1918, Destremau was finally recognized for his actions at Papeete and was posthumously awarded the Légion d'honneur.|$|E
