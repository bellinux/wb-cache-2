5|$|A {{subsequent}} poll by The Straits Times {{found that}} while many Singaporeans knew what the anthem generally meant, only seven out of 35 persons interviewed knew the meaning of each word. However, all but three of those interviewed agreed that the anthem {{should continue to be}} sung in Malay. The three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in English because that was the language most commonly used in Singapore. All the interviewees, including those who did not know the meaning of the lyrics, said they felt a sense of pride when they <b>heard</b> <b>or</b> sang the national anthem.|$|E
5|$|Research by the Glasgow Media Group {{indicates}} that coverage of Sinn Féin by the BBC before the ban was minimal. In 1988 Sinn Féin was only <b>heard</b> <b>or</b> {{seen on television}} 93 times, had only 17 of the 633 formal BBC interviews as compared to 121 interviews with the Conservative Party and 172 with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the civil service, and were never interviewed in the studio like many other participants. However, after the ban there was a steep decline in coverage of Sinn Féin and Republican views, with television appearances being reduced to 34 times in the following year, and the delays and uncertainties caused by ambiguities, voice-overs and subtitles often led to coverage and films being dropped entirely.|$|E
5|$|In some of Messiaen's scores, he notated the colours in {{the music}} (notably in Couleurs de la cité céleste and Des canyons aux étoiles...)—the purpose being to aid the {{conductor}} in interpretation rather than to specify which colours the listener should experience. The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen's synaesthesia, which he said caused him to experience colours when he <b>heard</b> <b>or</b> imagined music (he {{said that he did}} not perceive the colours visually). In his multi-volume music theory treatise Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d'ornithologie ("Treatise of Rhythm, Colour and Birdsong"), Messiaen wrote descriptions of the colours of certain chords. His descriptions range from the simple ("gold and brown") to the highly detailed ("blue-violet rocks, speckled with little grey cubes, cobalt blue, deep Prussian blue, highlighted by a bit of violet-purple, gold, red, ruby, and stars of mauve, black and white. Blue-violet is dominant").|$|E

25|$|According to the Antisymmetry theory {{proposed}} by Richard Kayne, {{there is no}} head-directionality parameter as such: it is claimed that at an underlying level, all languages are head-initial. In fact, {{it is argued that}} all languages have the underlying order Specifier-Head-Complement. Deviations from this order are accounted for by different syntactic movements applied by languages. Kayne argues that a theory that allows both directionalities would imply an absence of asymmetries between languages, whereas in fact languages fail to be symmetrical in many respects. Kayne argues using the concept of a probe-goal search (based on the ideas of the Minimalist program), whereby a head acts as a probe and looks for a goal, namely its complement. Kayne proposes that the direction of the probe-goal search must share the direction of language parsing and production. Parsing and production proceed in a left-to-right direction: the beginning of sentence is <b>heard</b> <b>or</b> spoken first, {{and the end of the}} sentence is <b>heard</b> <b>or</b> spoken last. This implies (according to the theory) an ordering whereby probe comes before goal, i.e. head precedes complement.|$|E
25|$|The American {{soap opera}} Guiding Light (originally titled The Guiding Light until 1975) {{started as a}} radio drama in January 1937 and {{subsequently}} transferred to television in June 1952. With the exception of several years in the late 1940s, during which creator Irna Phillips {{was involved in a}} dispute with Procter & Gamble, Guiding Light was <b>heard</b> <b>or</b> seen nearly every weekday from 1937 until 2009, making it the longest story ever told in a broadcast medium.|$|E
25|$|Local ambiguities persist {{only for}} {{a short amount of}} time as an {{utterance}} is <b>heard</b> <b>or</b> written and are resolved during the course of the utterance so the complete utterance has only one interpretation. Examples include sentences like The critic wrote the book was enlightening, which is ambiguous when The critic wrote the book has been encountered, but was enlightening remains to be processed. Then, the sentence could end, stating that the critic is the author of the book, or it could go on to clarify that the critic wrote something about a book. The ambiguity ends at was enlightening, which determines that the second alternative is correct.|$|E

25|$|A notable {{amount of}} medieval {{literature}} is anonymous. This {{is not only}} {{due to the lack}} of documents from a period, but also due to an interpretation of the author's role that differs considerably from the romantic interpretation of the term in use today. Medieval authors often deeply respected the classical writers and the Church Fathers and tended to re-tell and embellish stories they had <b>heard</b> <b>or</b> read rather than invent new stories. And even when they did, they often claimed to be handing down something from an auctor instead. From this point of view, the names of the individual authors seemed much less important, and therefore many important works were never attributed to any specific person.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternate}} {{version of}} this theory is that authorities were aware of Sydney being attacked {{at the time of}} or shortly after the battle, but deliberately delayed organising searches for survivors. There is no evidence that anybody ashore knew of the battle until Trocas found German survivors and informed the authorities. The Sydney Research Group allege that Sydney attempted to radio Darwin to report that the cruiser was on fire and being abandoned. Other individuals or groups have made claims that they <b>heard</b> <b>or</b> witnessed the receipt of messages (either voice or morse) from Sydney, or saw transcripts of these messages. All claims state that transcripts and other evidence were later destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Another survey {{conducted}} in 2006 by researchers from Australia's Monash University {{sought to determine}} what types of phenomena that people claim to have experienced and the effects these experiences have had on their lives. The study was conducted as an online survey with over 2,000 respondents {{from around the world}} participating. The results revealed that around 70% of the respondents believe to have had an unexplained paranormal event that changed their life, mostly in a positive way. About 70% also claimed to have seen, <b>heard,</b> <b>or</b> been touched by an animal or person that they knew was not there; 80% have reported having a premonition, and almost 50% stated they recalled a previous life.|$|E
25|$|Witnesses saw Moseley {{enter his}} car, drive away and return ten minutes later. Shadowing {{his face with}} a wide-brimmed hat, he {{systematically}} searched the parking lot, the train station and an apartment complex, eventually finding Genovese, who was barely conscious and lying in a hallway {{at the back of the}} building, where a locked door had prevented her from going inside. Out of view of the street and of those who may have <b>heard</b> <b>or</b> seen any sign of the initial attack, Moseley stabbed Genovese several more times before raping her, stealing $49 from her and running away again. The attacks spanned approximately half an hour, and knife wounds in Genovese's hands suggested that she attempted to defend herself from him. A neighbor, Sophia Farrar, found her shortly after and held her in her arms.|$|E
25|$|Kristiansen's mother testified {{during the}} trial that she saw her son {{arriving}} and walking in the backyard {{on the evening of}} the murders, and as such could not have been at the murder-site. This statement also matched the measurements in the telecommunication reports since the cell cite connected to Kristiansen's phone was close to his home, a fact Kristiansen's mother couldn't have known about since the cell phone alibi wasn't discovered until the trial was almost over. Furthermore, a witness saw a man together with two girls right before the crime. The description he gave matched Andersen and the victims. He did not see a second man, and it's unlikely that the witness saw Kristiansen instead of Andersen since Kristansen is a short and thin while Andersen is tall and big. Despite extensive public outreach for everyone who was in the area to contact the police, no other people matched this description. This witness, a commercial airline pilot, was not called as witness to the trials. Additional 5 people that <b>heard</b> <b>or</b> saw relevant activity that did not fit the timeline created by the police were not called as witness to the court either.|$|E

Stephen Tropiano called this episode [...] "the definite highlight of Season One" [...] in PopMatters and, in the 2002 book The Prime Time Closet, Tropiano called it a moral lesson about judging a person based on appearances. Nevertheless, Tropiano said that the fictional baseball player Tom Kenderson is typical of gay characters who are related to a series regular, appear just once, are exploited for delivering a message about homosexuality to the audience, and are then discarded, never to be [...] "seen, <b>heard,</b> <b>or</b> mentioned again".|$|E
