This unbalanced moment is distributed to members BA and BC in accordance with the distribution factors [...] and [...] Step 2 ends with carry-over of balanced moment [...] to joint C. Joint A is a roller support which has no rotational restraint, so moment carryover from joint B to joint A is zero.* Step 3: The unbalanced moment at joint C now is the summation of the <b>fixed</b> <b>end</b> moments , [...] and the carryover moment from joint B. As in the previous step, this unbalanced moment is distributed to each member and then carried over to joint D and back to joint B. Joint D is a fixed support and carried-over moments to this joint will not be distributed nor be carried over to joint C.* Step 4: Joint B still has balanced moment which was carried over from joint C in step 3. Joint B is released once again to induce moment distribution and to achieve equilibrium.* Steps 5 - 10: Joints are released and fixed again until every joint has unbalanced moments of size zero or neglectably small in required precision. Arithmetically summing all moments in each respective columns gives the final moment values.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{mechanical}} behaviour of cohesive soil at relatively high stresses {{with a particular}} emphasis on the significance of specimen end restraint on the interpretation of triaxial test results. Undrained triaxial shear tests have been performed on specimens K 0 consolidated to stresses ranging from 0. 6 to 10 MPa. Behaviour is examined at three well-defined OCRs of 1, 2 and 4 in compression mode of shear. The tests were performed on Resedimented Boston Blue Clay (RBBC), a low plasticity illitic clay resedimented in the laboratory from natural Boston Blue Clay. The triaxial test results demonstrate a significant and consistent decrease in normalized undrained strength, initial stiffness and friction angle with increasing stress level at each OCR. These trends are observed regardless of specimen end condition and {{are consistent with the}} results of previous studies performed on RBBC as well as on other resedimented clays. Previous investigations which have examined behaviour at high stresses through a program of laboratory triaxial testing have all involved the use of <b>fixed</b> <b>ends</b> in the triaxial device, i. e. the ends of the specimen are restrained from radial deformation by rough porous stones. Problems associated with specimen end restraint can be minimized by using smooth end platens in the triaxial device. The impact of end restraint has been examined by comparing the results of triaxial tests performed using smooth ends with corresponding results obtained using conventional <b>fixed</b> <b>ends.</b> When shearing is carried out at a relatively slow rate, the use of <b>fixed</b> <b>ends</b> has been shown to result in a small but consistent underestimation of undrained strength at each OCR tested. In addition, the use of <b>fixed</b> <b>ends</b> results in the measurement of misleadingly high pore pressures during undrained shearing, even when shearing is performed at a slow rate and pore pressure equalization is allowed to occur throughout a specimen. Slip surfaces were not found to develop during shearing for tests performed with smooth ends, although they do occur if <b>fixed</b> <b>ends</b> are used. The occurrence of a slip surface in resedimented clay is believed to be caused by the boundary conditions of the test. by Brendan Casey. Thesis (S. M.)
