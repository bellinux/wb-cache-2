5|$|As The World Ends with You {{focuses on}} the {{character}} of Neku Sakuraba, {{in order to create a}} believable story the developers put a lot of focus on his development, such as how he would feel, what thoughts lie behind his actions, how he interacted with other characters, and how the people around <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> about him. The developers included aspects and daily concerns, hoping that they could be things that players would have to deal with their personal lives and therefore would let them relate with Neku.|$|E

5|$|Donald Petrie was {{originally}} signed {{to direct the}} episode, but dropped out to direct the film Mystic Pizza. Executive producer Robert Justman brought in Rob Bowman to direct his first Star Trek episode. Justman later {{said that this was}} one of his most-significant achievements on The Next Generation. Bowman worked on storyboards and set blocking for twenty days before shooting the episode. He was initially nervous about working on the show, and felt he had to prove himself because of his relative inexperience as a director.

He went on to direct twelve more episodes of The Next Generation.|$|E

His two sons were the first in the McCartney family line to buy cars. When The Beatles became successful, Jim had to leave Forthlin Road because fans used to stand outside and stare through the windows, which made <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> uncomfortable and nervous.

5|$|The divorce proved {{difficult}} for Jackson, who spent several weeks lamenting his loss. Presley {{was the first}} person with whom he had connected on such a high level. She had supported him as he faced allegations and became dependent on pain medication. It was also {{the first time that the}} pop singer had had a sexual chemistry with another. Presley was able to make him open up and express himself through their physically intimate moments together. At the time, Jackson was afraid there would never be another who made <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> the way his ex-wife had. He eventually realized he had to move on; he had a world tour coming up and music to work on. Jackson also knew that Presley would never make him a father, which he longed to be.|$|E

5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) are dating each other, {{which they have}} been holding in secrecy from him in order to make his breakup with Erin easier. Andy {{attempts}} to fire Pete, but Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) points out that he can not do this since Pete and Erin already disclosed their relationship. Erin and Pete then both lecture Andy about moving on, claiming that working alongside one's ex-lover {{does not have to be}} awkward. To refute this claim, Andy hires both Pete's ex-girlfriend Alice (Collette Wolfe) and Erin's ex-boyfriend Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). After giving Pete and Erin time to appreciate how uncomfortable this is, he holds a meeting with them and their ex-lovers, leading the two couples to argue with each other.

5|$|Frustrated that Gee {{refuses to}} {{consider}} the possibility of a police shooting, Pembleton assures him he will get a confession out of Staley, whether he did it or not. Pembleton starts the interrogation calm and polite, but gradually becomes angrier, frightening Staley. Pembleton makes <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> responsible for allowing Cox to be at the crackhouse, and uses that guilt to break Staley down and confess, even though he is obviously innocent. Pembleton gives the confession to Gee, who is conflicted, especially when Pembleton compares it to past police practices of white detectives getting confessions from black suspects no matter what the cost. Ultimately, Gee tears up the confession and instead visits Staley at jail. Staley admits to Gee that Lt. Jimmy Tyron (Michael S. Kennedy) shot Cox in the back without warning while Cox was running away. Pembleton and Bayliss arrest Tyron at his home, where they confiscate a gun and bullets that appear to match those used against Cox. The arrest deeply saddens Howard, who had previously had an affair with Tyron. The affair ended because Tyron was married with children, but Howard continues to harbor romantic feelings for him.|$|E
5|$|Gee (Yaphet Kotto) {{informs the}} detectives that Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) {{has been shot}} in the head, and he orders an {{immediate}} investigation.

Crosetti comforts Thormann's wife Eva (Edie Falco), but is privately told by Dr. Eli Devilbiss (Sean Whitesell) that Thormann may be blind or mentally disabled, even if he survives. Crosetti begs Gee to give him the case and, even though Gee believes he is too emotionally involved, he gives in when Crosetti tries to make <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> guilty by showing him his previous gunshot wounds. When an investigation at the crime scene turns up nothing, Lewis catches Crosetti praying with a rosary in the locker room. Crosetti convinces a skeptical Lewis to pray with him for help in the investigation.|$|E
50|$|After {{a failed}} {{uprising}} in 1893, Alem saw {{many of his}} supporters leave <b>him.</b> <b>Feeling</b> disappointed and betrayed, he killed himself on 1 July 1896, by shooting himself in his right temple inside a carriage.

He is ordered to defend her and tells Sarah and his friends, who are shocked to hear this.|$|R
5|$|Having {{worked with}} Cary Guffey on Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Spielberg felt {{confident}} {{in working with}} a cast composed mostly of child actors. For the role of Elliott, he auditioned hundreds of boys before Jack Fisk suggested Henry Thomas for the role because Henry had played the part of Harry in the movie Raggedy Man which Jack Fisk had directed. Thomas, who auditioned in an Indiana Jones costume, did not perform well in the formal testing, but got the filmmakers' attention in an improvised scene. Thoughts of his dead dog inspired his convincing tears. Robert MacNaughton auditioned eight times to play Michael, sometimes with boys auditioning for Elliott. Spielberg felt Drew Barrymore had the right imagination for mischievous Gertie after she impressed him with a story that she led a punk rock band. He enjoyed working with the children, and he later said that the experience made <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> ready to be a father.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 until mid-1947, the Piccards were {{consultants}} to General Mills (the cereal company and dominant industry in Minneapolis) working under Otto Winzen, who Jean had met through the university. Winzen and Jean proposed a stratosphere flight with 100 cluster balloons and secured a government {{contract with the}} Navy. Featured in Navy press releases, Jean was named a project scientist responsible for gondola design and for testing the balloon film materials. But he balked, both at making weekly status reports that made <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> like a lower-level employee, and {{at the prospect of}} General Mills owning the patents to his ideas. Working as a consultant, Jeannette threatened to break off ties with the Navy and General Mills unless she was allowed to fly with Jean. Unfortunately this began a rift between General Mills and the Piccards. They were both were fired in 1947, for they were too critical of Winzen and General Mills staff.|$|E
5|$|Sigi Schmid {{was born}} in TÃ¼bingen, West Germany, on March 20, 1953. At the age of four, he moved {{with his family to}} the United States; they took up {{residence}} in Torrance, California, in 1962. Schmid's father, Fritz, who had been a prisoner of war during World War II, worked at Pabst Brewing; his mother, Doris, ran a Los Angeles-based German deli, where Schmid worked on weekends. Schmid's family spoke German at home, making <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> German despite spending so much of his life in America. He began school in the United States with little understanding of English and a stuttering speech disorder he did not overcome until high school. In his youth, Schmid visited Germany every summer, playing soccer with the local children and watching Bundesliga clubs play exhibition matches in neighboring towns. In 1964, Schmid played for the inaugural American Youth Soccer Organization team, an achievement for which he was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1996.|$|E

5|$|Things {{come to a}} {{head the}} day after the party. As Cassandra uses a voodoo doll on Masha, trying to dissuade {{thoughts}} of selling the house, Sonia receives {{a phone call from a}} man she met at the party, requesting a date. Hesitantly, she accepts. Vanya, who is secretly writing a play inspired by Konstantin's imagined symbolist drama in The Seagull, is convinced by Nina to let her read it in front of the others. During the reading (which stars Nina as a molecule and takes place after the destruction of the earth), Spike rudely answers a text on his phone, and dismisses Vanya's suggestion of a handwritten response. Vanya reacts by launching into an impassioned rant, criticizing America's cultural regression in communication and media, while fondly and wistfully recalling the surroundings and memories of his childhood. Concluding that the intent of such progress seems to make people like <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> lost and forgotten, he retreats into the kitchen in tears.|$|E
5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins to look as if it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get a second job and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with the people around him who, in trying to help him, make <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is the very real possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E
25|$|Sassoon {{refers to}} Edward Carpenter's writing on {{sexuality}} The Intermediate Sex, {{and it is}} implied that Sassoon is a homosexual because he states that such works made <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> normal about his sexuality.|$|E

60|$|Saying those words, he {{took off}} his hat with a sardonic {{assumption}} of respect; and, holding her arm in his, forced her to walk on abruptly with <b>him.</b> <b>Feeling</b> certainly assured by this time that the man was no other than Van Brandt, I was on the point of answering him sharply, when Mrs. Van Brandt checked the rash words as they rose to my lips.|$|R
