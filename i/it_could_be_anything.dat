60|$|The captain sent Bub {{below for}} his night-glasses. Everybody crowded to the lee-rail {{to gaze at}} the {{suspicious}} stranger, which already began to loom up vague and indistinct. In those unfrequented waters the chance was one in a thousand that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> else than a Russian patrol. The captain was still anxiously gazing through the glasses, when a flash of flame left the stranger's side, followed by the loud report of a cannon. The worst fears were confirmed. It was a patrol, evidently firing across the bows of the Mary Thomas {{in order to make}} her heave to.|$|E
60|$|His {{thoughts}} {{suddenly turned}} to the girl by his side. He looked at her pityingly,--looked at her, too, with curiosity. She had accepted his coming almost {{as a matter of}} course. All the time, though he had known well that she was suffering, she had been wordless, as though her grief were something so great that no outward sign of <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> else but pitifully inadequate. In her quiet, graceful walk, the very reserve, the negativeness, so to speak, of her coloring, her speech, her looks, she still represented to him an insoluble enigma. Was it possible, now that her brother had gone, that she would speak? In any case, the silence between them could not continue much longer, for already they were down on the marshes, and, as though by common consent, had turned seaward, towards where the lonely gray tower stood out on its little sandy eminence.|$|E

60|$|Once she had {{a terrible}} alarm, on a Sunday. Letty came rushing to her, declaring that Jumbo, dear Jumbo, and a gentleman were in the front court. Was it really Jumbo? Come and see! No, she durst not, and Fay almost {{instantly}} declared that Madge had shut them out. The children both insisted that Jumbo it was, but Aurelia would not believe that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> but an attempt of her enemies. She interrogated Madge, who had grown into a certain liking for one so submissive and inoffensive. Madge shook her head, could not guess how such folks had got into the court, was sure they were after no good, and declared that my Lady should hear of all the strange doings, and the letters {{that had been left}} with her. Oh, no, she knew better than to give them, but my Lady should see them.|$|E
60|$|That was it. A little nearer. Whereas if we {{had only}} had a little more wind, only a very little more, we might, we should, have been abreast of Liant by this time and {{increasing}} our distance from that contaminated shore. And {{it was not only}} the distance. It seemed to me that a stronger breeze would have blown away the contamination which clung to the ship. It obviously did cling to the ship. Two men. One burning, one shivering. I felt a distinct reluctance to go and look at them. What was the good? Poison is poison. Tropical fever is tropical fever. But that it should have stretched its claw after us over the sea seemed to me an extraordinary and unfair license. I could hardly believe that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> worse than the last desperate pluck of the evil from which we were escaping into the clean breath of the sea. If only that breath had been a little stronger. However, there was the quinine against the fever. I went into the spare cabin where the medicine chest was kept to prepare two doses. I opened it full of faith as a man opens a miraculous shrine. The upper part was inhabited by a collection of bottles, all square-shouldered and as like each other as peas. Under that orderly array there were two drawers, stuffed as full of things as one could imagine--paper packages, bandages, cardboard boxes officially labelled. The lower of the two, in one of its compartments, contained our provision of quinine.|$|E
6000|$|... "The crisis came," [...] Mrs Boulnois continued, [...] "when I persuaded John {{to let me}} {{take down}} some of his speculations {{and send them to}} a magazine. They began to attract attention, {{especially}} in America, and one paper wanted to interview him. When Champion (who was interviewed nearly every day) heard of this late little crumb of success falling to his unconscious rival, the last link snapped that held back his devilish hatred. Then he began to lay that insane siege to my own love and honour which has been the talk of the shire. You will ask me why I allowed such atrocious attentions. I answer that I could not have declined them except by explaining to my husband, and there are some things the soul cannot do, as the body cannot fly. Nobody could have explained to my husband. Nobody could do it now. If you said to him in so many words, 'Champion is stealing your wife,' he would think the joke a little vulgar: that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>anything</b> but a joke--that notion could find no crack in his great skull to get in by. Well, John was to come and see us act this evening, but just as we were starting he said he wouldn't; he had got an interesting book and a cigar. I told this to Sir Claude, and it was his death-blow. The monomaniac suddenly saw despair. He stabbed himself, crying out like a devil that Boulnois was slaying him; he lies there in the garden dead of his own jealousy to produce jealousy, and John is sitting in the dining-room reading a book." ...|$|E

50|$|When {{looking at}} all of the major {{movements}} of avant-garde that were influential from this time period, almost all of these art forms trace back to earlier avant-garde art forms, namely Dadaism. For instance, in practice, Abstract Expressionism was influenced by Dada {{by the fact that the}} art form had its similarities not in the way that the art was constructed, but rather from the concept that the genres exemplify. Pop Art also marks its influences from Dada because, like the “ready-mades” which used commonplace items in a way that they were not originally intended. For the case of Dada, the “ready-mades” consisted of items such as toilets as art. For the case of pop art, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> <b>anything</b> that proved influential in popular culture, whether it be comic strips, soup cans, or magazine advertisements.|$|R
