5|$|There {{were several}} avenues of appeal {{available}} to the Bali Nine. Lawyers had seven days post-sentencing to lodge appeals. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> limit for those convicted to request clemency from the President of Indonesia, but this requires an admission of guilt and had never been granted for a drug crime until 2009. All appealed to overturn their sentence. The sentences of Chen, Czugaj, Nguyen, Norman and Stephens stand at life imprisonment and Lawrence's sentence remains at 20 years after appeal. In May 2011, Rush's death sentence was reduced to life after he launched a final appeal in August 2010.|$|E
5|$|This <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for men {{who oppose}} Senator McCarthy's methods to keep silent, or for those who approve. We can deny our {{heritage}} and our history, but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. There is no way for a citizen of a republic to abdicate his responsibilities. As a nation we have come into our full inheritance at a tender age. We proclaim ourselves, as indeed we are, the defenders of freedom, wherever it continues {{to exist in the}} world, but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home.|$|E

She was, the slyly watchful Diana observed, very white and tired. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to think of nice conduct. There was Richard to be saved." ...|$|R

25|$|General {{anesthesia}} may {{be necessary}} because of specific risks to mother or child. Patients with heavy, uncontrolled bleeding may not tolerate the hemodynamic effects of regional anesthesia. General anesthesia is also preferred in very urgent cases, such as severe fetal distress, when there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to perform a regional anesthesia.|$|E
25|$|The {{first four}} {{phases of the}} game, if the player uses the editors only minimally, will take up to 15 hours to complete, but can take as little as one or two hours. Note that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> limit for any stage: the player may stay in a single stage {{as long as they}} wish, and {{progress}} to the next stage when ready. At the end of each phase, the player's actions cause their creature to be assigned a characteristic. Each phase has three characteristics, usually based on how aggressively or peacefully the phase was played. Characteristics determine how the creature will start the next phase and give it abilities that can be used later in the game.|$|E
25|$|The rules {{may create}} social {{problems}} in some situations, {{especially for the}} widow. For example, among observant Jews, if the brother on whom the yibbum obligation falls is too young to marry, the widow would need {{to wait until the}} brother reaches marriage age or the age at which he may opt out of the marriage. The widow would not know if the brother would even opt out of the marriage. Furthermore, in either event, by that stage the widow may be past her child-bearing age, and still be subject to the possible obligation to marry the brother. Also, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> limit on the indication of the brother's intention as to whether he will proceed with the marriage or opt out, and the brother may already be married.|$|E

25|$|The dojo has {{a league}} also. Each of the {{students}} competes. The stronger a player is, the fewer games they have to play. Two different time limit rules {{are used in the}} league games. There is a longer time limit where each player has a minute to move, and hayago where the players are given just 10 seconds to make a move. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> limit, so any given player can play 1 or 10 games in one day. The league also has a rating system. The ratings are based on the players' winning percentages. There is a handicap, but one that was very different than the orthodox system of allowing the opponent to place the number of stones to the difference in rank. The stronger player gets 10 seconds less in their time for every number difference in rank. There is also a reverse komi rule. 0 komi, —3 komi, —5 komi, and —8 komi.|$|E
25|$|We want {{every man}} and woman in these two {{counties}} to recall the dates of these murders and also to recall whether or not any person close to them was missing or out of pocket during those nights. Persons who have such information and have been withholding it when they know they should report it are leaving themselves open to possible charges of complicity in event the slayer is captured. Make no mistake {{about the fact that}} the slayer will be captured because we will not give up this hunt until he has been captured or killed. All information received will be treated confidentially. We urge you to come in and tell what you know. Don't be hesitant or fear that you are causing an innocent man embarrassment and trouble in as much all investigation will be confidential. This <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to take any chance on information which might lead us to the slayer. This maniac must be captured. We believe that we are justified in going to any ends to halt this chain of murder. Bear in mind--this killer may strike at any one. He may strike at persons close to him. For that reason, we believe any person with information that may lead us to the murderer should act in the interest of self-preservation.|$|E

She wrote in the e-mail, [...] "The people of Massachusetts didn't send me to Washington to roll over and play dead while Donald Trump and his team of billionaires, bigots, and Wall Street bankers crush the working people of our Commonwealth and this country," [...] and [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to quit." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 2011, Kowalewicz {{stated that}} [...] "At this point there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> frame for touring, as our main {{priority}} is finishing writing and recording this new record". Kowalewicz also stated [...] "the songs this far are unlike anything we've ever done before yet it {{still seems to}} capture the urgency of our first record". Kowalewicz stated, in an interview, that the first three albums would form a trilogy and that the new album would not be named Billy Talent IV.|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from its}} {{predominantly}} nonverbal storytelling, Mysts gameplay is unusual among adventuring computer games in several ways. The player {{is provided with}} very little backstory {{at the beginning of}} the game, and no obvious goals or objectives are laid out. This means that players must simply begin to explore. There are no obvious enemies, no physical violence, and no threat of [...] "dying" [...] at any point, although it is possible to reach a few [...] "losing" [...] endings. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> limit to complete the game. The game unfolds at its own pace and is solved through a combination of patience, observation, and logical thinking.|$|E
500|$|The book's {{endpapers}} {{had been}} overlooked. Potter {{wrote to the}} firm: [...] "I conclude there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to get an end-paper design done—unless Mr. Stokoe has already designed one—I do not mind one way or another; I had begun to scribble something but it looks a bit stiff." [...] Mr. Stokoe apparently did not design one because the endpapers were either plain white or mottled lavender. Several years later, they were replaced with a design featuring a pie and a patty-pan and the cover illustration changed to Ribby sitting by the fire. In the 1930s, the book's size was reduced to bring it into line {{with the rest of}} the Peter Rabbit books. The title was changed at that time to The Tale of the Pie and the Patty-Pan.|$|E

500|$|There {{are plans}} {{to connect the}} two segments, but there were {{insufficient}} funds available to complete the nearly [...] project and right-of-way needs to be acquired. [...] TxDOT only has $7.7 million of the $30 million required for construction costs. [...] Bexar County {{will pay for the}} balance of the project costs with TxDOT reimbursing the County when funds become available. [...] Relocation assistance is being provided to landowners to persuade them to sell their property for the highway. [...] With a shortage of funds and the right-of-way not purchased, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> table for construction. [...] Local opposition to the extension cite greater highway needs elsewhere, environmental concerns in the corridor, and a reluctance to sell land needed for the highway as chief concerns of the highway. [...] Once completed, the highway is believed to provide relief to nearby Loop 1604.|$|E
500|$|Juliet {{explains}} that Ethan kept {{a stash of}} the serum at a nearby drop point. She goes out into the jungle and retrieves the serum, but Sayid and Sawyer have followed her, and they want answers. Juliet tells them there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time,</b> and realizing {{they are not going}} to budge, she stands up to them and says she finds it interesting that they are the camp's moral police, considering their violent pasts. She takes the serum back to the beach and gives it to Jack. He warns her that if anything happens to Claire, he will not be able to protect her against the will of the survivors any longer and she would be alone, to which Juliet states that she already is. At the camp, Claire wakes up. She is feeling and looking much better. Juliet is now on the path to being trusted by the survivors. Jack brings her supplies to set up her tent area and tells her eventually everyone will need answers. Juliet asks why Jack trusts her and does not ask for answers. He says because when the submarine exploded, he saw in her eyes that she wanted to get off this island more than anything. That makes her [...] "one of us." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the opinion}} of Robin Fedden, a diplomat, and later Deputy General Secretary of the National Trust {{and author of the}} Trust's first guidebook for Chartwell, the house became [...] "the most {{important}} country house in Europe". A stream of friends, colleagues, disgruntled civil servants and concerned military officers came to the house to provide information to support Churchill's struggle against appeasement. At Chartwell, he developed what Fedden calls, his own [...] "little Foreign Office... the hub of resistance". The Chartwell visitors' book, meticulously maintained from 1922, records some 780 house guests, not all of them friends, but all grist to Churchill's mill. An example of the latter was Sir Maurice Hankey, Clerk of the Privy Council, who was Churchill's guest for dinner in April 1936. Hankey subsequently wrote, [...] "I do not usually make a note of private conversations but some points arose which gave an indication of the line which Mr Churchill is likely to take in forthcoming debates (on munitions and supply) in Parliament". A week later, Reginald Leeper, a senior Foreign Office official and confident of Robert Vansittart, visited Churchill to convey their views on the need to use the League of Nations to counter German aggression. Vansittart wrote, [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to lose. There is indeed a great danger that we shall be too late".|$|E

It {{is a time for}} us to mourn." [...] Phiyega presented aerial photography of the events which she claimed demonstrated that the strikers had advanced on the 500 strong police force before they had opened fire.|$|E
