40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedIn recent years {{a significant number}} of digital devices and systems have been added to receiving and data-processing sites. These additions have enhanced the ability of the sites to accomplish their mission. They have also introduced new kinds of electromagnetic interference (EMI) into these sites along with accompanying performance degradation problems. In this thesis one specific case of EMI is considered. It is EMI from a digital climate-control system of a building housing a <b>data-processing</b> <b>facility.</b> The digital system generated excessive amounts of EMI. The EMI was conducted throughout the site over power and control conductors. Electromagnetic fields from EMI current flowing in these conductors coupled the EMI into other nearby conductors. Integrated barrier, filter, and ground techniques were used to reduce the conducted and radiated EMI to harmless levels. U. S. Army (USA) autho...|$|R

40|$|The MonALISA (Monitoring Agents using a Large Integrated Services Architecture) {{framework}} {{provides a}} distributed service system capable of controlling and optimizing large-scale, data-intensive applications. An {{essential part of}} managing large-scale, distributed <b>data-processing</b> <b>facilities</b> is a monitoring system for computing facilities, storage, networks, and the {{very large number of}} applications running on these systems in near realtime. All this monitoring information gathered for all the subsystems is essential for developing the required higher-level services—the components that provide decision support and some degree of automated decisions—and for maintaining and optimizing workflow in large-scale distributed systems. These management and global optimization functions are performed by higher-level agent-based services. We present several applications of MonALISA's higher-level services including optimized dynamic routing, control, data-transfer scheduling, distributed job scheduling, dynamic allocation of storage resource to running jobs and automated management of remote services among a large set of grid facilities...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} {{program has been}} written for off-line calculation of relative and absolute percentages of the five serum protein fractions usually seen on cel-lulose acetate electrophoretograms, with use of manually observed peak heights on densitometer scans. With myeloma-like peaks, both peak height and width at half-peak height must be measured. Routine application of the program saves technician time and decreases the number of large random errors. Additional Keyphrases relative and absolute percentages #{ 149 }myelorna pii electrophoresis on cellulose acetate T IME-CONSUMING, error-prone counting and cal-culating procedures are required for transform-ing densitometer output into reportable form. This problem has been met by more sophisticated instrumentation that combines the photometric and arithmetic functions (1 - 3). Such equipment is costly. Therefore, we studied the feasibility of performing off-line calculations, by use of the hospital’s central <b>data-processing</b> <b>facilities.</b> The procedure evolved requires visual measure-ment only of peak heights of the five normally observed fractions. When myeloma or macro-globulin fractions (M-proteins) occur, both peak height and width at half-peak height are recorded. A description of the procedure and experimental justification for its adoption are presented...|$|R

Former state Senator Henry Kirksey {{and the police}} association put their weight behind Ditto {{in the last couple}} of weeks of the Democratic runoff. Ditto is credited with the creation of many initiatives during his 8-year tenure including revitalization of the Farish Street Neighborhood Historic District, revitalization of the train station, and active support of private business improvement districts. In his first year as mayor he proposed that the city government work closely with Jackson State University on long range planning. In particular, he proposed a new African studies institute that would foster trade and academic exchange with the continent. Ditto pushed minority-owned and small business venture financing investigations and efforts to expand medical and <b>data-processing</b> <b>facilities</b> near downtown. He wanted a spacious convention center downtown and the re-opening of Lake Hico to citizens for recreation. He has been a strong supporter of downtown Jackson and critical of businesses leaving the area for the suburbs.|$|R

40|$|Applications {{to quality}} {{control of a}} laboratory’s own {{individual}} frequency distribution curves are described. The method has recently become feasible for routine use, since the curves can now be compiled automatically {{by means of an}} <b>electronic</b> <b>data-processing</b> system. Applications described include verification of the validity of results generated by a given method in terms of the frequency distributions obtained for each type of diagnostic classification, and the determination of the constancy of these distributions. The relative value of different test methods can be compared by the success which is achieved in distinguishing diagnostic classifications (as measured by the overlaps of different frequency distribution curves). Individual frequency distribu-tions {{can also be used to}} determine the precision required for given test, in order to avoid any loss in the discrimination which can be achieved. A S THE VARIETY and number of tests done in clinical laboratories in-creases, the role of quality control becomes more important. With in-creasing work loads, an inaccurate procedure can lead to a larger num-ber of answers which are incorrect or of little value. Effective quality control is difficult to achieve, however, for the following reasons (1). Limitations of time or personnel may restrict the selection of methods to those which are simpler to perform, or which lend themselves to automation. Accurate standards are not always available (2), and some test results may be affected by other substances in serum in addi...|$|R
40|$|By {{its very}} nature, {{meteorology}} is global and transboundary in scope. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) exists, therefore, essentially {{to facilitate the}} international coordination, standardisation and maintenance of meteorological observing, data exchange and <b>data-processing</b> <b>facilities,</b> directed ultimately at the provision of meteorological data and services {{for the benefit of}} mankind. It does this, inter alia, through providing assistance, as required, in the development of national facilities and human resources to allow every national Meteorological Service to both participate in and benefit from the global systems and programmes. National Meteorological Services have traditionally been concerned with the collection of meteorological and oceanographic data at sea and with the provision of meteorological and related services for the mariner. This involvement has expanded rapidly {{over the past two decades}} with expanding utilisation of the oceans and concern for the sustainable management of the marine environment, as well as an increasing realisation of the critical role of the oceans in the global climate system. WMO's efforts to strengthen national Meteorological Services have therefore included an important element of marine capacity building. This paper gives an overview of WMO's technical cooperation and education and training activities in general, before outlining in more detail the requirements for and activities of the Organisation in marine capacity building. These activities are illustrated through three specific case studies, giving three different types of assistance and three different degrees of success. The paper concludes by analysing the reasons for success or failure and drawing lessons from these for the future directions of our work in marine capacity building. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} {{and application of}} simulation models in traffic engineering has taken a rapid upswing with the availability of efficient <b>electronic</b> <b>data-processing</b> systems. For different application purposes thereby a multiplicity of models have been developed, each of them obviously covering more or less smaller subsectors or problem definitions. This situation analysis gives a neutral technical overview of available models. The {{focal point of the}} investigation is in road traffic models. Models mostly simulating individual traffic; rail transport are analyzed in a separate section. Apart from model developments in Germany models are considered which has been developed by international groups of researchers. For the analysis of the individual simulation models a questionnaire was developed and dispatched to all model developers. For the situation analysis a good information basis resulted which can be regarded as almost completely; altogether information from 105 models is present. The present models are predominantly shaped by their monomodal adjustment. The increasing meaning of short time and short period prognoses for the traffic condition in larger regional or closely meshed networks in the city make linkages of models of the different levels necessary. Apart from this integration of models a multi-modal approach to analyse traffic systems wins increasingly importance. Research and developping needs exists in two different aspects - application-oriented, regarding linkages and integrations of models as well as scientifically, regarding the development of new program modules and the updating and supplement of the 'state of the art' in subranges.
