5|$|Blackman's <b>guilty</b> <b>verdict</b> led to {{a showing}} of {{public support for the}} Marine, with people {{creating}} social media groups and online petitions alternately asking that he be given a lenient sentence and calling for his release. The Daily Telegraph supported one Change.org petition for leniency.|$|E
5|$|Amid the {{continuing}} uproar, Playford decided to grant clemency. The Royal Commission {{concluded that the}} <b>guilty</b> <b>verdict</b> was sound. Although a majority of those who spoke out against {{the handling of the}} matter—including Dunstan—thought that Stuart was probably guilty, the events provoked heated and bitter debate in South Australian society and destabilised Playford's administration, while bringing much publicity to Dunstan.|$|E
50|$|The AFL {{suspended}} Dank from {{involvement in}} the sport for life {{as a result of}} the <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts.</b> Dank was found not guilty of twenty-one other charges, including trafficking charges and all charges related to administering the supplements. Dank appealed the ten <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts</b> against him, but the appeals were dismissed after Dank failed to attend the session scheduled for him with the AFL appeals board in November 2016. WADA lodged an appeal against the twenty-one not <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts</b> in June 2015, and these appeals remain open as of August 2017.|$|R

5|$|During closing arguments, {{defense counsel}} John Pope {{attempted}} to discredit Darby; the latter reacted by assaulting one of Pope's co-counselors with a cane. The trial lasted thirteen days, {{and despite the}} absence of any physical evidence, including a murder weapon, the jury returned a <b>guilty</b> <b>verdict</b> after only an hour of deliberation on May 19. Beauchamp was sentenced to be executed by hanging on June 16, 1826.|$|E
5|$|Eighty-nine {{per cent}} of courts martial {{returned}} a <b>guilty</b> <b>verdict,</b> {{the vast majority}} of cases being for offences such as Absence Without Leave (the most common offence), drunkenness and insubordination. Terms of imprisonment were often suspended, to discourage soldiers from committing an offence to escape the front lines, but also to give a convicted man a chance to earn a reprieve for good conduct.|$|E
5|$|Harry Innes' {{libel suit}} against Joseph Street was not fully {{adjudicated}} in the Jessamine County Circuit Court until 1811. The jury found in Innes' favor and awarded $750 in damages, although Innes' counsel, Henry Clay and Robert Wickliffe, insisted that Innes only desired the vindication of a <b>guilty</b> <b>verdict</b> against Street {{and would not}} collect the damages. Soon after, Street shuttered the Western World and moved to Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Five {{defendants}} were then indicted for stealing £50 {{from the house}} of Robert Edwards in Ely. Mr Gurney addressed the jury at length describing the events occurring {{in the town of}} Ely {{on the morning of the}} 23 May 1816. Eight witnesses were called. The jury returned <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts</b> against Dennis, Jefferson, and Rutter. Hopkin and Cammell were given not <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 25 June 2009, the Supreme Court {{overturned}} the not <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts</b> {{and ordered a}} retrial for three men on charges related to her murder.|$|R
25|$|Experts {{believed}} Skilling's {{best chance}} was in citing a parallel appeals court decision that had dismissed <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts</b> on three Merrill Lynch bankers accused of helping Enron to inflate profits.|$|R
5|$|On August 26, the {{day after}} the <b>guilty</b> <b>verdict</b> was reached by the jury, Judge Roan brought counsel into private {{chambers}} and sentenced Leo Frank to death by hanging with the date set to October 10. The defense team issued a public protest, alleging that public opinion unconsciously influenced the jury to the prejudice of Frank. This argument was carried forward throughout the appeal process.|$|E
5|$|On 30 July 1987, Wood {{was convicted}} on {{two counts of}} murder, one of {{attempted}} murder and one of theft, after a week-long trial. He had {{pleaded not guilty to}} the murder of Danielle, instead submitting a manslaughter plea claiming he killed her to complete a suicide pact. An appeal against the <b>guilty</b> <b>verdict</b> was filed a month later and rejected in 1989. The case impacted upon British firearms policy, especially the manner in which regional police forces communicate over firearm ownership.|$|E
5|$|Opinion polling {{regarding}} Croatian EU membership was regularly {{carried out}} by the CRO Demoskop, Ipsos Puls and Mediana Fides agencies. Since 2008, these polls overall indicated support for Croatian EU membership; in May 2011 and after, support ranged between 55% and 63%. The highest support since 2008 was 64% {{in the first half of}} November 2010. The lowest level of EU membership support (between 23% and 38%) was reported on 15–16 April 2011 in the wake of the ICTY's <b>guilty</b> <b>verdict</b> for Generals Gotovina and Markač.|$|E
5|$|The jury in Hayes' {{case was}} {{composed}} of seven women and five men. Following {{the completion of the}} trial, the jury deliberated for about four hours to reach its <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts.</b>|$|R
25|$|The trial lasted 3 {{months from}} September until November 19, 1986 when the jury {{came back with}} their <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts</b> for all eight {{defendants}} on all 151 counts in the indictment.|$|R

5|$|The first Castellania {{was built}} in 1572, during the magistracy of Grand Master Jean de la Cassière, and was likely {{designed}} by Girolamo Cassar, similar to other Valletta buildings of the late 16th century. The building had a military appearance, with the corners designed with massive quoins, typical of Cassar. The Castellania made use of bells to attract people and inform about an event, such as a <b>guilty</b> <b>verdict.</b> Similar to other prominent buildings, the Castellania was provided with water within its courtyard by connection to the Wignacourt Aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|At the International Criminal Tribunal for {{the former}} Yugoslavia, the trial of Milan Martić {{resulted}} in a <b>guilty</b> <b>verdict</b> with regard to Martić's involvement on Kijevo, and {{the findings of the}} Trial Chamber in 2007 regarding Kijevo were confirmed by the Appeals Chamber in 2008, based on witness testimonies about it being ethnic cleansing. The siege of Kijevo was the first instance of application of the strategy of ethnic cleansing in the Yugoslav Wars. The events at Kijevo {{were not included in the}} indictment at the trial of Ratko Mladić, but the Croatian judiciary tried Mladić in absentia for war crimes committed in Kijevo. He was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison.|$|E
5|$|Brought {{to the bar}} {{next was}} Henry Benson, a farmer who was out on bail, charged with inciting to riot. Benson was held in surety for £400 plus two other sureties for £200 each. He was to appear for trial at the next assizes. Richard Cooper the elder and Richard Cooper the younger were also bound over to the next assizes. Father and son, William Beamiss the elder and the younger, were then brought in and charged with assaulting and {{stealing}} from Robert Cheesewright the younger, of Littleport, in the Isle of Ely. Mr Gurney addressed the jury. Mr Burrough summed up and the jury gave their <b>guilty</b> <b>verdict</b> to both prisoners shortly after.|$|E
50|$|The {{crime of}} {{genocide}} in the Srebrenica enclave was confirmed in several <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts</b> handed down by the ICTY, most notably in the conviction of the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.|$|R
5|$|Between 1790 and 1797, only 143 or 147 {{criminal}} cases {{were brought in}} the circuit courts, and 56 of those cases were brought in the Pennsylvania circuit court concerning the Whiskey Rebellion. And, between 1790 and 1801, only 426 {{criminal cases}} were brought in all federal courts (the district courts and the circuit courts combined). Between 1801 and 1828, a total of 2,718 criminal indictments were returned in the circuit courts: 596 resulted in <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts</b> by juries; 479, not <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts</b> by juries; 902, nolle prosequi; and 741, other (either no disposition recorded, abated, quashed, discharged, discontinued, or prison break).|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{following}} the <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts</b> handed down to 34 {{past and present}} Essendon players in January 2016 for doping violations, Essendon was {{given the opportunity to}} recruit top-up players between January and March 2016.|$|R
5|$|During the September term, a {{jury was}} finally selected, {{and the trial}} {{consumed}} {{the rest of the}} term. Much of the same evidence was presented, and the second jury also voted for a <b>guilty</b> <b>verdict.</b> The date for Desha's execution was set for July 14, 1826. Harry O. Brown, the judge in the case, had been temporarily appointed by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. He set aside the verdict, ruling that the prosecution had failed to prove that the murder occurred in Fleming County, as charged in the indictment. The prosecution unsuccessfully argued that because a change of venue had already been granted, the place of the murder was immaterial.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, the {{prosecution}} alleged bribery and witness tampering {{attempts by the}} Frank legal team. Meanwhile, the defense requested a mistrial because it believed the jurors had been intimidated by the people {{inside and outside the}} courtroom, but the motion was denied. Fearing for the safety of Frank and his lawyers in case of an acquittal, Roan and the defense agreed that neither Frank nor his defense attorneys would be present when the verdict was read. On August 25, 1913, after less than four hours of deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous <b>guilty</b> <b>verdict</b> convicting Frank of murder.|$|E
5|$|Martić {{was tried}} at the International Criminal Tribunal {{for the former}} Yugoslavia (ICTY) on several {{different}} charges of war crimes including, {{his involvement in the}} siege of Kijevo. The trial resulted in a <b>guilty</b> <b>verdict,</b> and the findings of the Trial Chamber regarding Kijevo, made in 2007, were confirmed by the ICTY Appeals Chamber in 2008, based on witness testimonies about it being ethnic cleansing. The siege was the first instance of use of the ethnic cleansing in the Yugoslav Wars. Croatian authorities tried Mladić in absentia and convicted him for war crimes committed in Kijevo.|$|E
50|$|Shkreli’s attorney, Benjamin Brafman, {{told reporters}} that five not-guilty {{verdicts}} is positive, and said he thinks that the three <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts</b> -- if they survive post-trial motions -- {{will lead to a}} lenient sentence.|$|R
50|$|On 20 May {{the trial}} finished, {{with the jury}} {{returning}} <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts</b> on all participants on 22 May. In total the judge handed out sentences totalling 106 years, with Green alone jailed for 18 years.|$|R
2500|$|On 21 and 22 November {{the jury}} {{returned}} <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts</b> for all ten murders. Terming her crimes [...] "appalling and depraved", the judge sentenced Rosemary {{to life in}} prison, emphasising that she should never be paroled.|$|R
5|$|On May 24, 1913, Frank {{was indicted}} {{on a charge}} of murder and the case opened at Fulton County Superior Court on July 28. The {{prosecution}} relied heavily on the testimony of Conley, who described himself as an accomplice to the murder, and who the defense at the trial argued was in fact the perpetrator of the murder. A <b>guilty</b> <b>verdict</b> was announced on August 25. Frank and his lawyers made a series of unsuccessful appeals; their final appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States failed in April 1915. Considering arguments from both sides as well as evidence not available at trial, Governor John M. Slaton commuted Frank's sentence from capital punishment to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Pitt's {{administration}} {{took the}} <b>guilty</b> <b>verdict</b> in Paine's trial {{as a sign}} that further prosecutions for sedition were possible, and began many. In the 17 months following the trial, 11 publishers of the Rights of Man were prosecuted, receiving prison sentences of up to 4 years. These acted as a prelude to the 1794 Treason Trials, in which a dozen reformers were indicted for allegedly conspiring to bring about a revolution. Erskine played a prominent role in defending many of them, including Thomas Hardy, John Horne Tooke and John Thelwall, all three of whom were acquitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{use of a}} {{military}} tribunal provoked criticism from Edward Bates and Gideon Welles, who believed that a civil court should have presided; but Attorney General James Speed pointed to the military nature of the conspiracy and the facts that the defendants acted as enemy combatants and that martial law was in force {{at the time in}} the District of Columbia. (In 1866, in Ex parte Milligan, the United States Supreme Court banned the use of military tribunals in places where civil courts were operational.) Only a simple majority of the jury was required for a <b>guilty</b> <b>verdict,</b> and a two-thirds for a death sentence. There was no route for appeal other than to President Johnson.|$|E
50|$|In September 2012, Italy's highest court, the Court of Cassation, {{upheld the}} <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts</b> {{that had been}} handed down by lower courts. The Italian {{government}} has not stated whether it would seek extradition of the convicted Americans.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{the impact of a}} judicial warning, witness age, and the method of testimony presentation on mock jurors' perceptions of credibility of witnesses and accused, and on <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts.</b> The participants were 435 undergraduate university students who listened to an audio-taped summary of a theft trial followed by abbreviated instructions to the jury. Witness age was 7, 10, or 23, the jury warning was either present or absent when witnesses were children, and the testimony by the prosecution eyewitness and accused were either presented or summarized. For the taped testimony conditions, the mock witnesses and the accused read a fact pattern describing the events in the case and were audio-taped as they answered a series of questions, which constituted direct and cross-examination. The testimony of the 7 -year-old child, compared to the 10 -year-old, was associated with lower cognitive competence and higher suggestibility, but also with higher accuracy of recall (lower mistaken recollection) and lower credibility of accused. The pattern of results for appraisal of the older child was more similar to that of an adult witness. The young adult was judged to be less trustworthy than children of either age. While the presence of a warning had no impact on <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts</b> when a 7 -year-old was a witness, there were fewer <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts</b> when a witness was 10 years old. Participants also made fewer <b>guilty</b> <b>verdicts</b> when a young adult's testimony, compared to conditions involving child witnesses, was presented, but not when it was summarized...|$|R
