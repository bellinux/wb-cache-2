There was the sense, profound and wordless, that if He knew everything I {{did not have to}} know everything, and that, in seeking to know everything, I'd been, all of my life, missing the entire point. No social paradox, no historic disaster, no hideous record of injustice or misery should keep me from Him. No question of Scriptural integrity, no torment over the fate of this or that atheist or gay friend, no worry for those condemned and ostracized by my church or any other church should stand between me and Him. The reason? It was magnificently simple: He knew how or why everything happened; He knew the disposition of every single soul. He wasn't going to let anything happen by accident! Nobody {{was going to go to}} Hell by mistake." ...|$|E

As I rushed upon him he put out his hands and clutched at my shotgun. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> both barrels, and he tumbled down dead and mangled at my feet." ...|$|E

There came a {{point in my life}} where <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> of some of that baggage. When it comes to that whole side, there's a back story that involves my group dealing with a case three years ago. I kind of reached a resolution with that. Coincidentally, the bunny tried to make another cameo appearance when we were filming the final investigation of the season, but we just told it to go to you-know-where. I hope it makes the cut!".|$|E
