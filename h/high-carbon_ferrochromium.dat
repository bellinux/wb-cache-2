40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a detailed description}} of the process of creation of a surface alloy layer (using <b>high-carbon</b> <b>ferrochromium)</b> on the cast steel casting. The mechanism of the surface alloy layer is based on the known theories [5, 6]. The proposed course of formation of the layers has been extended to decarburization stage of steel. The research included proving the presence of carbon-lean zone. The experiment included the analysis of the distribution of elements and microhardness measurement...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{research results}} of microstructure and selected mechanical properties of alloy layer. The {{aim of the}} researches {{was to determine the}} influence of Ni, Mo, Si and Ti with <b>high-carbon</b> <b>ferrochromium</b> (added separately to pad) on the alloy layer on the steel cast. Metallographic studies were made with use of light microscopy. During studies of usable properties measurements of hardness, microhardness and abrasive wear resistance of type metal-mineral for creation alloy layer were made. As thick as possible composite layer without any defects and discontinuity was required. The conducted researches allowed to take the suitable alloy addition of the pad material which improved the quality of the surface alloy layer...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, many {{investigations}} {{have been conducted}} on the <b>high-carbon</b> <b>ferrochromium</b> forhard-facing cladding to improve the hardness and wear resistance of industrial parts. In high-carbon Cr-basedhard-facing alloys with hypereutectic composition, the microstructure contain great amounts of (Cr,Fe) 7 C 3 carbides and slight amounts of Fe-Cr solid solution matrix phases. (Cr,Fe) 7 C 3 carbide and Fe-Cr phase havelower toughness result in the cladding of hypereutectic composition has a terrible brittle surface. The wearresistance of the cladding lowers because the initial position of wear generates in the surface area with crack. In first year, this investigation adds various amounts of pure Ti and Ag into the high-carbon Cr-basedhard-facing alloys with hypereutectic composition to improve the terrible brittle surface. The analysis of thecladding consists of hardness test, chemical composition analysis, microstructure observation and evaluationof crack. This purpose is to discuss the effect of various Ti and Ag contents on the properties and crackimprovement of the cladding. In second year, this plan adds various kinds and amounts of flux into the high-carbon Cr-basedhard-facing alloys with hypereutectic composition to improve the terrible brittle surface. This purpose is todiscuss the influence of various kinds and amounts of fluxes on the properties and crack improvement of thecladding. In third year, the direction {{of this study is}} to continue the first and second years. The work is todiscuss the improvement method and reason of various pure elements and fluxes on crack in high-carbonCr-based hard-facing alloys with hypereutectic composition. Besides, the schematic diagram of theory toimprove the crack is built. 近年來，許多研究已經成功地將高碳鉻基硬面合金銲覆在較軟的基材表面上，來改善工業用件表面之硬度值與抗磨耗能力。在高碳鉻基硬面合金中，當成份落在過共晶成份範圍內時，顯微結構會形成大量的(Cr,Fe) 7 C 3 碳化物與少量的Fe-Cr 固溶基地相，因Fe-Cr 固溶基地相為體心立方結構(BCC) ，其韌性較差，再加上(Cr,Fe) 7 C 3 碳化物為硬脆的相，故在此成份下所得到的銲覆層表面脆裂程度相當嚴重，而表面所產生的裂縫處，便是磨損所造成的起始位置，使整體銲覆層的抗磨耗能力下降。本計畫第一年是將不同含量的鈦與銀元素添加到過共晶具有初晶(Cr,Fe) 7 C 3 碳化物的高碳鉻基硬面合金中，來改善硬面層表面的脆裂程度，並針對銲覆層做硬度測試、成分分析、微結構分析與裂縫評估，探討不同鈦與銀含量對銲覆層性質與裂縫改善成效之影響。第二年則是將不同種類與含量的助銲劑添加到過共晶具有初晶(Cr,Fe) 7 C 3 碳化物的高碳鉻基硬面合金中，來改善硬面層表面的脆裂程度，探討不同種類與含量的助銲劑對銲覆層性質與裂縫改善成效之影響。第三年的研究方向是延續第一年與第二年的研究，針對不同純元素與助銲劑對銲覆層表面裂縫改善的方法與原因作探討，並建構出裂縫改善的方法與原因機制圖...|$|E
