5|$|As {{predicted}} {{through the}} actions of the boys in the film, there were numerous news reports of underage South Park fans engaging in unsuccessful attempts to gain entrance to the film at theaters. There were reports of adolescents purchasing tickets for WB's own Wild Wild West and instead sitting in to see South Park. This came {{as a result of a}} movie-industry crackdown that would make <b>it</b> <b>tougher</b> for children to sneak into R-rated films, as proposed by President Bill Clinton at the time in response to the moral panic generated by the Columbine High School massacre, which occurred two months before the film's release. South Park was cited, along with American Pie, as an explicit film released in the summer of 1999 tempting teens to sneak into theaters. When the film was released in the United Kingdom in August 1999, there were similar reports of the film drawing an underage crowd.|$|E

Some writers discuss how the font size is at times worse than that of the first generation Kindle. It appears that whether the Kindle 2 is clearer or fuzzier than the prior model depends on the font size.|$|E
2500|$|Boros {{preferred}} {{to refer to}} himself an advocate of base running: [...] "I've always been a strong advocate of base running, not necessarily base stealing, but base running. Because ultimately, you win because you score more runs, and what I want is to be 90-feet smarter and 90-feet more aggressive than the other team." [...] Always {{a student of the}} game, Boros' attitude toward the stolen base had changed by 1986. In an interview that year, Boros said: [...] "The science against stealing has evolved radically in {{the last four or five}} years. That has made <b>it</b> <b>tougher</b> than ever to steal. Pitchers have quicker deliveries, step off and quick pitch, hold the ball. Catchers pitch out much more often. Now you've got pitching coaches with stopwatches timing pitchers' deliveries, while other coaches are timing catchers' throws to second base." ...|$|E

2500|$|Not {{everyone}} has embraced the Sport Bowling concept. PBA Hall of Famer Johnny Petraglia argues that Sport Bowling combats changes in bowling balls simply by making <b>it</b> <b>tougher</b> to roll a {{shot into the}} [...] "pocket" [...] (the 1–3 pins for a right-hander, 1–2 pins for a left-hander). According to Petraglia, Sport Bowling is merely an attempt to [...] "create the scores that were shot 30 years ago. The problem is, 30 years ago the game wasn't tougher. You could hit the pocket as easily as you do now, but you couldn't knock over the same [...] of pins with a rubber bowling ball. Sport bowling is, for the first time, intentionally {{trying to make the}} lanes tough." [...] Petraglia's suggestion to combat high-tech bowling balls is to use heavier pins that are single-voided on the bottom (versus double-voided), making them less top-heavy.|$|E
2500|$|Wallace {{previously}} {{stated that}} filming the baby swap storylines [...] "did not stretch her acting abilities". She told Buzz: [...] "None of it's been really tough for me, {{to tell you}} the truth. I go in, do my scenes and then I go home. As an actress you want to get roles you can get your teeth into. I leave it at the gates when I leave work. Years ago, with the storyline when Kat told Zoe Slater she was her real mother, I found <b>it</b> <b>tougher</b> because I was new to the game. But I've been doing it a lot longer now, and can detach myself from it. You have to." [...] On a lighter note, Wallace added: [...] "There are two babies playing Tommy, called Ralph and Shane, and they're dressed in outfits like zebra-skin babygros and little denim jackets – that's the Alfie (Shane Richie) influence. They keep going for Kat's big earrings and they're always grabbing at the chicken fillets I have to wear." ...|$|E
2500|$|After taking office, Ali {{was interviewed}} by the Associated Press while [...] "holding his snoozing 8-month-old {{daughter}} outside the House chamber". When asked about the anti-Muslim protester during the campaign, Ali said the protester “was an exception to his experience on the campaign. 'It was disappointing {{that that kind of}} bigotry would still rear its head, but I understand it was an isolated incident. Occasionally people would ask if I was Muslim, {{but most of the time}} it was a curiosity, not an obstacle.'" [...] Ali did not want to be seen as just a novelty because of his religion, he said he'd “like to work on transportation matters and to pass a bill making <b>it</b> <b>tougher</b> for companies to track information and buying habits of private citizens." [...] He wanted his constituents to know he's one of them and said, [...] "I will represent the Muslims, but more importantly, I will represent all the people. I’m a Muslim, but I’m also a resident." [...] In other interviews that asked the same question, Ali replied “I'm Muslim, and that'll always be the case, but I'm here to push good issues and good policy for all Marylanders.... We're looking for good ideas", and [...] "I'm here to push good ideas, not so much to push my faith." ...|$|E
