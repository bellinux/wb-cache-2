Imagine that you and a peer form an opinion in isolation about whether P in response to mutually shared evidence, and you take your peer {{to be just as}} reliable as you about matters of this kind.

Advocates of the Equal Weight view state that in light of known peer disagreement about whether P, you ought to <b>revise</b> <b>your</b> opinion <b>in</b> {{such a way as to}} “split the difference” between your own view and that of your peer’s. 1 Let us call this the Equal Weight rule, or EWR.

Would you also <b>revise</b> <b>your</b> belief that it causes you to lose weight? Experiment 1 shows that our belief that Mark will lose weight is reduced after encountering the contradiction.
