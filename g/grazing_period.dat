5|$|Livestock {{depredation}} {{has been}} one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves, and can pose a severe problem for wolf conservation: as well as causing economic losses, the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found. Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programmes or state insurance. Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves, as they have evolved under constant human protection, and are thus unable to defend themselves very well. Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted: in Eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock, while such incidences are rare in North America, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored. The majority of losses occur during the summer <b>grazing</b> <b>period,</b> with untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation. The most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep (Europe), domestic reindeer (northern Scandinavia), goats (India), horses (Mongolia), cattle and turkeys (North America). The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus. Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing, though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures. In some cases, wolves do not need to physically attack livestock to negatively affect it: the stress livestock experiences in being vigilant for wolves may result in miscarriages, weight loss and a decrease in meat quality.|$|E

50|$|Rabbits graze {{heavily and}} rapidly for roughly the first half-hour of a <b>grazing</b> <b>period</b> (usually {{in the late}} afternoon), {{followed}} by {{about half an hour}} of more selective feeding. In this time, the rabbit will also excrete many hard fecal pellets, being waste pellets that will not be reingested. If the environment is relatively non-threatening, the rabbit will remain outdoors for many hours, grazing at intervals. While out of the burrow, the rabbit will occasionally reingest its soft, partially digested pellets; this is rarely observed, since the pellets are reingested as they are produced. Reingestion is most common within the burrow between 8 o'clock in the morning and 5 o'clock in the evening, being carried out intermittently within that period.|$|E
50|$|Rabbits are herbivores {{that feed}} by grazing on grass, forbs, and leafy weeds. They graze heavily and rapidly {{for about the}} first half-hour of a <b>grazing</b> <b>period</b> (usually in the late afternoon), {{followed}} by {{about half an hour}} of more selective feeding. If the environment is relatively non-threatening, the rabbit remains outdoors for many hours, grazing at intervals. Their diet contains large amounts of cellulose, which is hard to digest. Rabbits solve this problem by using a form of hindgut fermentation. They pass two distinct types of feces: hard droppings and soft black viscous pellets, the latter of which are known as caecotrophs and are immediately eaten (coprophagy). Rabbits reingest their own droppings (rather than chewing the cud as do cows and many other grazer) to digest their food further and extract sufficient nutrients.|$|E

40|$|Management-oriented {{models of}} cattle habitat use often treat grazing {{pressure}} {{as a single}} variable summarizing all cattle activities. This paper addresses the following questions: How does the spatial pattern of cattle effects vary between cattle activities in a highly heterogeneous landscape? Do these patterns change over the grazing season as forage availability decreases? What are the respective roles of natural and management-introduced structures? We estimated the intensity of herbage removal, dung deposition and trampling after each of three <b>grazing</b> <b>periods</b> on a grid of 25 m × 25 m cells covering an entire paddock in the Swiss Jura Mountains. We found no significant positive correlations between cattle effects. Spatial patterns weakened through the season for grazing and trampling, whereas dunging patterns changed little between <b>grazing</b> <b>periods.</b> Redundancy analysis showed that different cattle effects were correlated with different environmental variables and {{that the importance of}} management-introduced variables was highest for herbage removal. Autocorrelograms and partial redundancy analyses using principal coordinates of neighbour matrices suggested that dunging patterns were more coarse-grained than the others. Systematic differences in the spatial and seasonal patterns of cattle effects may result in complex interactions with vegetation involving feedback effects through nutrient shift, with strong implications for ecosystem management. In heterogeneous environments, such as pasture-woodland landscapes, spatially explicit models of vegetation dynamics need to model cattle effects separately...|$|R
5000|$|Grazing switchgrass {{calls for}} watchful {{management}} practices to ensure {{survival of the}} stand. It is recommended that grazing begin when the plants are about 50 cm tall, and that grazing be discontinued when the plants have been eaten down to about 25 cm, and to rest the pasture 30 - 45 days between grazing periods. Switchgrass becomes stemmy and unpalatable as it matures, but during the target <b>grazing</b> <b>period,</b> it is a favorable forage with a relative feed value (RFV) of 90-104. [...] The grass's upright growth pattern places its growing point off the soil surface onto its stem, so leaving 25 cm of stubble is important for regrowth. When harvesting switchgrass for hay, the first cutting occurs at the late boot stage - around mid-June. This should allow for a second cutting in mid-August, leaving enough regrowth to survive the winter.|$|E

5000|$|Nomadic {{pastoralism}} {{is a form}} of pastoralism when livestock are herded {{in order}} to find fresh pastures on which to graze. Strictly speaking, true nomads follow an irregular pattern of movement, in contrast with transhumance where seasonal pastures are fixed. [...] However this distinction is often not observed and the term nomad used for both—in historical cases the regularity of movements is often unknown in any case. The herded livestock include cattle, yaks, sheep, goats, reindeer, horses, donkeys or camels, or mixtures of species. Nomadic pastoralism is commonly practised in regions with little arable land, typically in the developing world, especially in the steppe lands north of the agricultural zone of Eurasia. Of the estimated 30-40 million nomadic pastoralists worldwide, most are found in central Asia and the Sahel region of West Africa. Increasing numbers of stock may lead to overgrazing of the area and desertification if lands are not allowed to fully recover between one <b>grazing</b> <b>period</b> and the next. Increased enclosure and fencing of land has reduced the amount of land available for this practice. There is substantive uncertainty over {{the extent to which the}} various causes for degradation affect grassland. Different causes have been identified which include overgrazing, mining, agricultural reclamation, pests and rodents, soil properties, tectonic activity, and climate change. Simultaneously, it is maintained that some, such as overgrazing and overstocking, may be overstated while others, such as climate change, mining and agricultural reclamation, may be under reported. In this context, there is also uncertainty as to the long term effect of human behavior on the grassland as compared to non-biotic factors.|$|E

More particulate organic matter accumulated in proportion to the below-ground phytomass, whereas the C:N ratio remained constant. Testing treatment effect at similar species composition and plant community effect within the same treatment showed that: (1) the increase in POM residence time was mainly due to the changes in species composition, (2) the decrease in nitrification activity resulted mainly from a direct effect of the treatment, and (3) a compensation between a direct positive and an indirect negative effect of the treatment resulted in no change in extractable N.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the effect of three different intensive silvopastoral systems (ISPS) on cattle animal welfare (AW) in Colombia. The three ISPS differed in area, plant composition, and grazing periods as follows: ISPS 1 - low plant diversity in paddocks of 1200 m 2, with <b>grazing</b> <b>period</b> of 24 h; ISPS 2 - middle plant diversity in paddocks of 600 m 2, with <b>grazing</b> <b>period</b> of 12 h; and ISPS 3 - high plant diversity in paddocks of 600 m 2, with <b>grazing</b> <b>period</b> of 24 h. Animal welfare was assessed using a wide range of criteria, which were integrated using L-spline functions and Choquet integrals to generate overall values. It was found that AW was good in all ISPS; the highest scoring criteria was for food and water, with 99, 97, and 100 points from a maximum of 100 for ISPSs 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Comfort showed values of 100 for all three systems, but good health was the most problematic criteria of the AW features with scores of 25, 40, and 36 for ISPSs 1, 2, and 3, respectively. All three ISPS showed excellent scores for appropriate behavior (82, 88, and 89). The welfare problems shown here were not specific to the individual ISPS, but were common to all livestock systems in the region.
