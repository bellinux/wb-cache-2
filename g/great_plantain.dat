Using Growing Degree Days (GDD) for estimating the phonological growth stages is more valid instead of calendar time. In order to study effect of salinity on growth analysis in three different plantago species, a greenhouse experiment was conducted in Vali-e-Asr University of Rafsanjan in 2009. The study was carried out factorial experiment based on RCBD design with 4 replications to {{determine the influence of}} salinity (9, 15, 21 dS/m and control with distilled water) and three plantago species (Isabgul, French psyllium, <b>Great</b> <b>plantain).</b> Polynomial equations with the 88 to 98 distinction coefficient (R 2) were known as the best indicator for interpreting of growth indices fluctuation to GDD. In all three species, the highest dry matter accumulation, leaf area, Crop growth rates (CGR) were observed in 900 - 1000 GDD at all salinity levels and in higher GDD, the decreeing trend of dry matter accumulation, leaf area and CGR were observed in all salinity levels. The lowest relative growth rate, crop growth rate, Leaf area ratio, dry matter accumulation were observed in 21 dS/m NaCl salinity. Results also indicated that maximum dry matter accumulation was observed in 800, 900 and 1100 degree day in Isabgul, French psyllium, <b>Great</b> <b>plantain,</b> respectively.

40|$|Leaves {{and seeds}} of Plantago major (common <b>plantain</b> or <b>greater</b> <b>plantain)</b> {{have been used}} for centuries to treat {{diseases}} relating to skin, digestive organs and blood circulation like wounds, inflammation and hypertension. Either whole or crushed leaves have been used to treat for example burns and all kinds of wounds to enhance the healing process, and to stop bleeding. To treat superficial wounds it is sufficient to apply the juice from the leaves. Both polysaccharides and polyphenols may have a synergistic effect on wound healing and other biological activities. Polyphenols extracted from leaves and seeds of P. major have been reported to have bioactive effects especially on wound healing, and to have antiulcerogenic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticarcinogenic and antiviral activity. Three subspecies have been described of P. major, two of which have been subjected to genetic and phytochemical analysis. Plantago major subsp. major is naturalized almost throughout the world and is mainly found as an agronomic weed. There has been little work emphasizing the utilization of the bioactive compounds from P. major in modern medicine. Similarly, the effects of genetic and environmental factors on the occurrence of these bioactive compounds have not been reported. The main emphasis of the introductor y paper is to highlight some factors that may be important for the utilization of Plantago major as a medicinal herb, providing the scope for the Ph. D. study.

40|$|A <b>great</b> many <b>plantain</b> {{varieties}} are cropped in West and Central Africa, {{and there is}} a lack of information about their production potential and suitability for cropping system environments. To obtain benchmark data for the production potential of plantain varieties, experimental and modelling approaches were combined to determine intrinsic growth parameters and to increase understanding of factors affecting yield. Five real plantains commonly cropped in Cameroon and representative of plantain group diversity (Batard, Big Ebanga, Essong, French clair and Mbouroukou n° 3) and four plantain-like hybrids (CRBP 39, D 248, D 535 and FHIA 21) were studied. A process-based growth model (the AAB model) was developed that accounts for specific characteristics of the plantain crop that includes parameters affecting growth, development and yield. Varietal-specific parameters were determined in a field experiment conducted under nearly non-limiting production conditions while general parameters were drawn from the literature. Parameters describing the conversion of intercepted radiation into dry matter were evaluated by model fitting. Photosynthetic efficiency was significantly higher for real plantains than for plantain-like hybrids. The model realistically simulated development, growth and bunch production for five varieties. These results are the first step in developing a useful tool for assessing the suitability of plantain varieties to different environments. The current study highlights the need for <b>greater</b> knowledge of <b>plantain</b> physiology in order to better model plantain growth and develop variety-specific production approaches.

40|$|Plantago major L. (<b>greater</b> <b>plantain,</b> common plantain) {{has been}} used as a wound healing remedy in {{different}} parts of the world for centuries. Different bioactive compounds have been proposed to contribute to the wound healing properties of this plant. The present study was undertaken to investigate the impact of some genetic and environmental factors on the wound healing activity of common plantain. Seeds of P. major were collected from five populations in different parts of Sweden, and were germinated and grown in a greenhouse. As expected for an inbreeding species, RAPD analyses demonstrated considerable between-population variation but very sparse within-population and within-subpopulation variation. Six major phenolic compounds were encountered in samples of P. major, four of which were identified for the first time in this thesis; PLMA 1 –PLMA 4. Between-population and sub-population differences in the contents of these chemical compounds showed no correlation with RAPD-based estimates of genetic relatedness. The contents of these compounds differed greatly between different plant organs of P. major. The highest concentration of plantamajoside and PLMA 2 was found in leaves whereas the highest concentration of verbascoside was found in flower stalks and seeds. Contents were significantly higher in freeze-dried leaf samples compared to samples dried at higher temperatures. Both water and ethanol-based extracts of P. major leaves stimulated the cell proliferation and migration in an in vitro scratch assay, and also showed anti-inflammatory activity in an in vitro NF-kB assay with oral epithelial cell cultures. Similarly, these extracts stimulated wound healing activities in ex vivo tests using detached pig ears. Further breeding efforts aimed at developing P. major as a crop plant, and medicinal research aimed at elucidating and optimizing extracts with wound healing properties, are thus warranted...|$|R
40|$|Varietal {{mixture is}} a {{cultural}} technique in which the genetic and functional diversities of varieties are used to manage pests and diseases. This strategy is commonly used on grass crops such as rice, barley, maize, and wheat to mitigate some windborne and soilborne pathogens. The effects of varietal mixtures on the number and community structure of pests, including plant-feeding nematodes (PFNs), however, have rarely been studied. In experiments conducted in Martinique, we evaluated the effect of varietal mixtures of bananas on PFN communities. A growth chamber experiment {{was used to measure}} the susceptibility of three banana cultivars dessert banana cv. 902 (Musa AAA, Cavendish subgroup); a new synthetic hybrid cv. FB 924 (Musa AAA); and a plantain cv. Creole blanche (Musa AAB, French Horn) to the two major PFNs. The multiplication rates of Radopholus similis and Pratylenchus coffeae were substantially different on the three varieties; for example, the multiplication rate was up to 10 times <b>greater</b> on <b>plantain</b> cv. Creole blanche than on hybrid cv. FB 924. In a field experiment, we planted the three varieties in pairs that included all six possible combinations. Banana varietal mixtures significantly affected both PFN densities and community composition. Differences in community composition among the pairs involved a shifting equilibrium among nematode species and an interspecific competition for food resources. The relative abundance of the spiral nematode Helicotylenchus multicinctus increased while that of the burrowing nematode R. similis, which is the most damaging species on bananas, decreased. The use of a varietal mixture in which one variety supports a low PFN multiplication rate appears to have practical relevance, especially in systems based on very susceptible cultivars such as plantains. The use of varietal mixtures should not create management problems, especially for plantations that produce bananas for local markets. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} explore the {{importance}} of indigenous agroforestry systems for biodiversity conservation, we compared the abundance, species richness and diversity of dung beetles and terrestrial mammals across a gradient of different land use types from agricultural monocultures (plantains) to agroforestry systems (cocoa and banana) and forests in the BriBri and Cabécar indigenous reserves in Talamanca, Costa Rica. A total of 132, 460 dung beetles of 52 species and 913 tracks of 27 terrestrial mammal species were registered. Dung beetle species richness and diversity were greatest in the forests, intermediate in the agroforestry systems and lowest in the plantain monocultures, while dung beetle abundance was <b>greatest</b> in the <b>plantain</b> monocultures. The number of mammal tracks per plot was significantly higher in forests than in plantain monocultures, whereas mammal species richness was higher in forests than in either cocoa agro-forestry systems or plantain monocultures. Species composition of both terrestrial mammals and dung beetles also varied across the different land use types. Our study indicates that indigenous cocoa and banana agroforestry systems maintain an intermediate level of biodiversity (which is {{less than that of}} the original forest but significantly greater than that of plantain monocultures) and provide suitable habitat for a number of forest-dependent species.

We then went on a little way, and in the evening anchored again. When going to bed for the night, I put out my candle, there being still a glimmering lamp burning, and, missing my handkerchief, thought I saw it on a box which formed one side of my bed, and put out my hand to take it. I quickly drew back on feeling something cool and very smooth, which moved as I touched it. [...] "Bring the light, quick," [...] I cried; [...] "here's a snake." [...] And there he was, sure enough, nicely coiled up, with his head just raised to inquire who had disturbed him. It was mow necessary to catch or kill him neatly, or he would escape among the piles of miscellaneous luggage, and we should hardly sleep comfortably. One of the ex-convicts volunteered to catch him with his hand wrapped up in a cloth, but from the way he went about it I saw he was nervous and would let the thing go, so I would mot allow him to make the attempt. I them got a chopping-knife, and carefully moving my insect nets, which hung just over the snake and prevented me getting a free blow, I cut him quietly across the back, holding him down while my boy with another knife crushed his head. On examination, I found he had large poison fangs, and it is a wonder he did not bite me when I first touched him.|$|R
40|$|The {{quality and}} {{production}} of ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) /white clover (Trifolium repens) pastures are seasonal in New Zealand. Earlier research showed that a sward mix of plantain (Plantago lanceolata), chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), white- and red-clover (Trifolium pratense) resulted in greater lamb live weight gains {{in the late summer}} early autumn period. However, this has not been tested across all the seasons in New Zealand. Therefore, research was undertaken for two consecutive years (2011 / 2012 and 2012 / 2013) on three sward mixes; Pasture mix, Plantain mix and Chicory mix in early spring, late spring and early summer (late spring), summer and autumn. The Pasture mix consisted of perennial ryegrass and white clover. The Plantain mix consisted of plantain, white- and red-clover. The Chicory mix consisted of plantain, chicory, white- and red-clover. It was hypothesised that lamb performance (live weight, live weight gain (LWG) and carcass weight) and apparent carcass weight production per ha would be <b>greatest</b> in the <b>Plantain</b> and Chicory mixes in all four periods. Secondly it was hypothesised that Plantain and Chicory mixes would have lower feed conversion ratios (FCR) with higher herbage utilization efficiencies (EHU%) than the Pasture mix. In each period weaned lambs were reared in the three herbage treatments for a maximum of two months. Lambs were weighed fortnightly and they were slaughtered within 12 hours of being off the pasture {{at the end of the}} experiment. Carcass weights were obtained from the abattoir. The Plantain and Chicory mixes had a higher feeding value than the Pasture mix during early spring to autumn. Both Plantain and Chicory mixes produced heavier (P< 0. 05) lambs, higher (P< 0. 05) live weight gains (LWG) and carcass weights compared to the Pasture mix in all periods. Total apparent carcass weight production per ha were 407, 748 and 709 kg/ha in year one and 474, 607 and 642 kg/ha in year two in the Pasture mix, Plantain mix and Chicory mix, respectively. Both Plantain and Chicory mixes had lower (P< 0. 05) feed conversion ratios (FCR) and higher (P< 0. 05) herbage utilization efficiencies (EHU%) compared to the Pasture mix. This research has shown that sheep farmers in New Zealand can finish lambs at a faster rate for heavier carcasses using herb-clover mixes from spring to autumn than on ryegrass/white clover pastures...|$|R
