Usually, domestic laundering {{will be carried}} out frequently to clean these protective garments. However, little research on the performance durability of this type of fabrics after domestic laundering has been reported. This paper selected fabrics of 8 types of cotton and its blend fibers, which were treated with flame retardants Pyrovatex CP, Proban, CFR- 201, SCJ- 968 respectively. The <b>damaged</b> <b>length,</b> after flame time, after glow time, TPP value, thermal resistance value, weight, thickness, air permeability and water vapor permeability (WVP) of the samples were measured before and after 15 cycles domestic laundering cycles. Results show that the flame retardancy of the 8 fabrics reduce with launderings as measured by the increase in <b>damaged</b> <b>length</b> and after glow time. The TPP increase probably resulted from the increase in the thickness and thermal resistance of the finished fabrics. Domestic laundering resulted in only a slight change in the comfort properties of the fabrics. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-A new {{characterization}} method is proposed {{to study the}} relationship between the hot-carrier-induced interface state I V ~ ~ (X) and the device drain current degradation of submicron LDD n-MOSFET’s. In this method, by making use of the con-ventional charge pumping measurement in combination with the power-law dependence of interface damages on stress time, the spatial distribution ATlt (x) and the effective <b>damaged</b> <b>length</b> &am can be easily extracted. The time evolution of the interface state generation and its correlation with the device degradation can then be well explained. It is worthwhile to note that this newly-developed method requires no repetitive charge pumping measurements, and hence avoids he likely imposition of re-stress on tested devices. By combining the characterized Ldam and quantitatively, the results show that the damage at T’GS z T/bs/ 2 is most highly localized among various stress biases, which can explain why the generated interface states will dominate the device drain current degradation at this bias after long-term operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|Master thesis in Offshore technologyThe {{combination}} {{of oil and}} gas reservoirs in sea areas with high shipping traffic brings some challenges for engineers. One of these challenges is related to subsea pipeline systems specially where water depth is classified as shallow or intermediate. Due to large number of vessels passing the area with shallow water depth, interaction between anchors of these vessels and the offshore pipeline can occur. If a dragging anchor hits and subsequently hooks the pipeline, the pipeline could be ruptured. When an offshore pipeline ruptures while it is in operational mode, the operation must be stopped immediately and a repair team has to repair the pipeline system as quick as possible. On the key steps for repairing the pipeline is to remove and replace <b>damaged</b> <b>length</b> of the pipeline. Hence evaluation of the damage length is important. In this project, the response of a ruptured pipeline by an anchor load was studied to predict and define the <b>damaged</b> <b>length.</b> In order to solve the problem, the solution method is split in three parts. In first step, the flow condition of hydrocarbons inside the pipeline as well the fluid interaction with the pipeline is calculated using one dimensional pipe flow software OLGA. During the second step, the mechanical response of the pipeline to load applied by the caught anchor is determined. The reaction of the pipeline from the moment after impact until rupture is studied using finite element analysis. ANSYS Workbench 14 software is used in this step. The third step determines the deformation of the subsea pipeline after rupture. A jet of released hydrocarbons will lead to a thrust force on the ruptured cross‐section. This force causes the ruptured pipeline to buckle. Purpose of this part is to identify where local buckling occurs and whether the pipeline collapses due to buckling or not. If the pipeline fails at buckled region, pipe’s sections from the buckled pipe’s cross‐section to ruptured pipe’s cross‐section have to be cut. This step is also done with finite element analysis using the ANSYS software. In this project a pipe section with length of 3000 m and outer diameter of 42 ’’ is modelled in ANSYS. Obtained results show that the displacement of the pipeline before rupture is already severe. According to the results, after rupture, the result is thrust force leads to either sides of the ruptured pipeline to buckle and fail at two regions. Hence, repair team has to cut the pipeline from the buckled pipe’s crosssections. The thrust force from the escaping fluid jet leads to additional length of pipe to be cut...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the scattering of the fundamental Lamb, shear horizontal and edge-guided Rayleigh-type wave modes from sub-surface and hard-to-inspect damage on cavities representative of fuel weep holes in integral stiffeners. Detection, localisation and characterisation of scattered elastic guided wave fields can assist with improving the reliability and probability of detection of health monitoring systems through informed placement of actuators and sensors. The combination of the experimental-computational-analytical approach gives rise to new insights and guidance for the quantification of defects located in hard-to-inspect regions with actuators and sensors placed in easily accessible locations. Three-dimensional laser vibrometry is used to confirm that ultrasonic guided plate waves, generated by permanently bonded low-profile surface-mounted piezoceramic disc transducers, are able to form edge-guided Rayleigh-type waves on the free surface of open cavities. The behaviour of the propagating ultrasonic guided waves around cavities and their interaction with simulated fatigue damage emanating from the cavities is visualised. In situ non-destructive evaluation of the airframe stiffener is shown to be viable using symmetric guided waves given that the strength of the characteristic scattered spiralling guided wave field maintains its form and grows in amplitude as the <b>damage</b> <b>length</b> in increased. In contrast to the high frequency bulk-wave wedge transducer methodology traditionally used for weep hole inspection, the length-scales of the in situ technique are such that the wavelength of the incident guided waves are comparable with the hole diameter, and larger than the defect length. The monitoring of upward growing hidden damage from circular weep holes in integral stiffeners using symmetric guided waves is unique in that the received energy, that is the measured surface velocity on the accessible surface, monotonically increases with respect to increasing <b>damage</b> <b>length.</b> A series of computational studies with a three-dimensional finite element model is conducted to understand how and why scattered plate waves from the defect can be detected on the accessible surface. The ability to accurately model acousto-ultrasonic elastic wave dynamics is crucial for future developments in this research field. The computational results are compared with the experimental laser vibrometry data for model validation. It is concluded that the boundary conditions for wave scattering from the hidden notch are a complex combination of the incident wave field and the dispersive edge-guided Rayleigh-type wave that is formed on the free surface of the cavity...|$|R

40|$|International audienceEmploying a pump-probe polarization-based two-frame shadowgraphy setup, the {{formation}} of filamentary damage induced in bulk fused silica by a nanosecond pulse at 1064 nm is investigated with a picosecond probe. Three different phases are exhibited in the damage experiments. The first phase is {{the formation}} of a micrometric plasma channel along the laser direction during the beginning of the pulse likely caused by multi-photon ionization. This channel exhibits growth during similar to 400 ps, and the newly grown plasma is discrete. Then, during the end of the pulse, this channel evolves into a tadpole-like morphology showing an elliptical head upstream the laser flux followed by a thin tail. This observed asymmetry is attributed to shielding effects caused by both the plasma and hot modified silica. Once the damage shows its almost final morphology, a last phase consists in the launch of a pressure wave enlarging it after the laser pulse. The physical mechanisms that might be involved in {{the formation of}} plasma channels are discussed. The experimental data are first confronted to the moving breakdown model which overestimates the filamentary <b>damage</b> <b>length.</b> Finally, taking into account the temporal shape of the laser pulses, the coupling between Kerr-induced self-focusing and stimulated Brillouin scattering is discussed to interpret the observations.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{increasing}} number of significant and violent tornado events in the United States have been documented and mapped at extremely high resolution by government, research and private entities using remotely sensed and post-event damage surveys; however, these assessments often generate inconsistent spatial measures of tornado strength, even for the same event. This investigation assembles a portfolio of contemporary tornado events that contain spatially comprehensive damage and/or wind velocity information from a diverse set of sources. Thereafter, the relationship between land-use/cover and tornado intensity is examined in order to quantify spatial measures of damage indicator bias in post-event tornado damage surveys. A climatology of both significant and violent tornado intensity assessments is then created, promoting the generation of synthetic, or model, paths with observationally constrained <b>damage</b> <b>length</b> and width metrics by the Enhanced Fujita scale magnitude. Results from the climatology and collection of synthetic paths are compared to previous observed, empirical and theoretical assessments, revealing differences in the spatial scale of the overall tornado footprint, as well as percentage contribution of swaths by Enhanced Fujita scale magnitude. The range of synthetic paths produced {{may be used to}} assess potential tornado damages to the population, the built environment and insurance portfolios...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{academic}} {{project was}} to {{study the effects of}} several variables on the damage progression within a mechanically fastened joint. The variables tracked included the composite layup, loading configuration (single shear vs. double shear), R value, stress level, and damage mechanisms observed in each specimen. In-situ x-ray of the individual laminates recorded the extent of damage, mostly longitudinal splitting and bearing, {{as a function of the}} cycle count. The following lay-ups were included: [04 / 45 / 03 / 90 / 0]s, [45 / 90 /- 45 / 02 / 45 / 02 /- 45 / 0]s, [± 5 / 65 /(± 5) 2 /- 65 /± 5]s, and [± 5 / 65 /(± 5) 2 /- 65 / 5 / 65]s. The stress levels at which detectable damage develops was determined. The researchers chose to apply 50, 000 cycles at each stress level. Once damage was detected, the stress level was typically raised 2. 5 ksi. Another 50, 000 cycles was then applied until the bolt hole diameter elongated by 10 % of it’s original <b>length.</b> The <b>damage</b> <b>length</b> versus stress level is plotted as a way to compare damage onset stresses and growth as a function of lay-up, stress ratio...|$|R
30|$|Quasi-brittle {{structures}} {{are characterized by}} {{the existence of a}} non-negligible fracture process zone. Linear elasticity fracture mechanics (LEFM) does not apply as it requires this zone to be negligible. In cohesive zone models (CZM), it is assumed that the process zone is concentrated over a line (2 D problems) or a surface (3 D), that defines the crack path. Damage models make no strong assumption on its size and shape; <b>damaged</b> zone <b>length</b> and width are a priori not negligible compared {{to the size of the}} material domain.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Vessels {{are rarely}} {{subjected}} to accidental loads {{such as the}} collision, grounding and stranding. But these accidental loads {{cause a lot of}} damages to hull structure including a large deformation, fracture, tearing and so on. In case of carrying dangerous goods such as crude oil, these accidents can induce a serious environmental pollution. All ocean-going vessels were made by welding. The welding residual stress is a significant shortcoming of welding remains at the hull structure, even though welding technology in shipbuilding field has provided a variety of advantages, e. g. remarkable shortening of the shipbuilding time. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the effects of the residual stress in a grounding accident. When a ship runs aground against a sea-obstacle like a rock, this accident can be classified as a grounding. Among parameters of grounding accident scenarios such as the ship speed, the initial striking point, and loading conditions of the ship, only ship speed varies from 10 to 15 knots under ballast condition with/without consideration of residual stress(this sentence is not clear to the read). The initial striking point is at the bow of the center line of ship. A series of nonlinear numerical simulations with large deformation and fracture were carried out using LS-DYNA. As a result, two cases with residual stress have longer <b>damage</b> <b>length.</b> The difference seems to be relatively small, but not negligible...|$|R
