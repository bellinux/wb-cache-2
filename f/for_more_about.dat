Apart from his stories for The Earlsfield Chronicle, his sole prior experience of magazine writing had been an article entitled [...] "Camping Out", for the Edinburgh-based young peoples' magazine Morning of Life. This account of a boating excursion on the Thames had appeared in 1875. For the first issue of the B.O.P., Reed wrote a school story, [...] "My First Football Match" [...] which, accompanied by a half-page illustration, appeared on the front page [...] "by An Old Boy". The story was very well received, and prompted demands <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> [...] "Parkhurst", the school where the football match was played. Reed responded with several more tales, among which were [...] "The Parkhurst Paper Chase" [...] and [...] "The Parkhurst Boat Race".|$|E
