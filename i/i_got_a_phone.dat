While visiting the company's recording studios on Sunset Boulevard, Crosby was asked to provide guide vocals for Meat Loaf, who was recording [...] "I'd Do Anything for Love".

500|$|Peterborough's Director of {{football}} Barry Fry criticised Nottingham Forest's owners for {{pulling out of}} the deal to sign Boyd, and chairman MacAnthony said, [...] "I'm devastated for George. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> call off him in bits... He said that he passed the medical then they made him do an eye test. He's played 300 matches and scored from the halfway line the other month, but Forest say he has an eyesight problem. The whole thing stinks. Alex McLeish wanted to sign him. It's the most ridiculous thing that's happened to me." [...] Peterborough subsequently said that with Boyd's contract expiring in the summer, they would be prepared to offer him a new contract or let him leave on loan when the emergency loan window opened, with at least one club having signalled their interest in doing so.|$|E

Chapman stated that he found out about his character's death the night before the initial table read for the season, saying [...] "I was in my hotel, minding my own business, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> call. I picked up the phone, and instantly, I knew it was coming. It was David Benioff and Dan Weiss, the two creators of the show, and they stated the facts. But they did it really nice. I couldn't have asked for a better way to have that news broken to me. Them telling me beforehand really helped me out, otherwise I would have been in a state when I read it in the scripts.

5000|$|Guido Coen (1915-2010) was an Italian-born British film {{producer}} and film subtitler. He {{and his family}} were interned in Douglas on the Isle of Man during the Second World War. He began his career working for Filippo Del Giudice and Two Cities Films. When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: <b>I</b> finally <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly [...] I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles ... I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught. And that was how we started.Coen later founded his own company Kenilworth Film Productions and spent most of the post-war years producing second features. He made a dozen films in partnership with the director Charles Saunders. He later produced the 1971 horror film Burke & Hare and the comedies Au Pair Girls and Intimate Games.|$|R

2500|$|The {{second half}} of the 1990s saw Moby in career turmoil after years of being a {{successful}} techno wunderkind. The release in 1996 of Animal Rights, a dark, eclectic, guitar-fueled record built around the punk and metal records that he loved as a teenager, proved a critical and commercial disaster that left him considering quitting music altogether and going back to school to study architecture. He explained: [...] "I was opening for Soundgarden and getting shit thrown at me every night onstage. I did my own tour and was playing to roughly fifty people a night." [...] However, he claimed, [...] "I got one piece of fan mail from Terence Trent D'Arby and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> call from Axl Rose saying he was listening to Animal Rights on repeat.

The two fishermen later gets in trouble, as it turns out that Irena is being chased by members of the russian mafia. This was the fifth time Floberg played in a film directed by Erik Gustavson, who praised him: [...] " [...] is my Robert De Niro. Our fifth film together. It has always gone well". Floberg, on the other hand, dryly commented: [...] "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> call [...] this time too". In an interview with Verdens Gang, he elaborated on his relationship with Gustavson: [...] "We have a really good understanding. We talk a lot in codes, and save a lot of time. Besides, I really like the way Erik works". Floberg also expressed his satisfaction with playing a [...] "good guy" [...] for once, humorously acknowledging that he is probably considered Norway's [...] "number one movie-psycho". Co-star Scorupco, on the other hand, characterized Floberg as charming, and [...] "easy to fall in love with". In Misery Harbour, a Scandinavian/Canadian collaboration from the same year, Floberg returned to playing a negative character. He received critical acclaim for his depiction of the arrogant literary critic Johan Hoeg, being described as [...] "brilliant", and [...] "taking on the role (...) with razor-sharp spitefulness".|$|E
