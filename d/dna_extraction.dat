5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} Hydnellum are {{hindered}} {{by the fact}} that some species are difficult to discriminate in the field, making it hard to determine an appropriate conservation status. Techniques based on species-specific PCR primers and <b>DNA</b> <b>extraction</b> from soil have been developed to detect the mycelia of various Hydnellum species without having to rely on the presence of fruitbodies, which may help conservation efforts as well as improve understanding of below-ground ecology. Similar techniques have been used to show that, in the case of H.aurantiacum and H.caeruleum, the fungus can persist below the ground for at least four years without producing fruitbodies.|$|E

40|$|Extractions from {{non-invasive}} hair samples usually yield low {{amounts of}} highly degraded DNA. Previously developed mammal molecular sexing methods were not designed with such sub-optimal conditions in mind. We developed {{a simple and}} reliable PCR-based sexing method aimed at degraded, low yield <b>DNA</b> <b>extractions</b> from the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). Comparisons of this new primer set with others showed that the reliability of sex determination from low-yield, degraded <b>DNA</b> <b>extractions</b> was improved if; amplification products were short (< 170 bp); and the Y-chromosome amplification product was shorter than the X-chromosome amplification product. The primers developed in this study appear useful for sex determination in other bear species...|$|R
25|$|Whether DNA testing {{can confirm}} the {{identity}} of the male: According to the experts, the use of ancient DNA technology in archaeological research has yet to be fully developed so there may be technical difficulties. Besides, the male skeleton was not well preserved so the <b>DNA</b> <b>extraction</b> procedure may be very complicated. Even if the technology is fully functional, scientists still require DNA samples from a verified living descendant of Cao Cao to confirm the results. It is very difficult to find a living descendant of Cao Cao and verify that he/she is really a descendant of Cao Cao.|$|E
25|$|A stool {{culture can}} detect the bacterium, {{although}} it is not a routine test and so must be specifically requested. The sample is cultured on sorbitol-MacConkey (SMAC) agar, or the variant cefixime potassium tellurite sorbitol-MacConkey agar (CT-SMAC). On SMAC agar O157 colonies appear clear due to their inability to ferment sorbitol, while the colonies of the usual sorbitol-fermenting serotypes of E. coli appear red. Sorbitol nonfermenting colonies are tested for the somatic O157 antigen before being confirmed as E. coli O157. Like all cultures, diagnosis is time-consuming with this method; swifter diagnosis is possible using quick E. coli <b>DNA</b> <b>extraction</b> method plus PCR techniques. Newer technologies using fluorescent and antibody detection are also under development.|$|E
25|$|Several {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} that increase accuracy of NGS platforms such as barcoding techniques and circle sequencing method. The data generated by these methods the same as NGS platforms originate from single strand of DNA and therefore the errors that are introduced during PCR amplification, tissue processing or <b>DNA</b> <b>extraction</b> can still be distinguished as a true variant. Duplex sequencing method solve this problem {{by taking advantage of}} complementary nature of two strands of DNA and confirming only variants that are present in both strands of DNA. Since the probability of two errors happening at the same exact base pair in both strands and resulting in a complementary basepair is very low, duplex sequencing increases the accuracy of sequencing significantly.|$|E

25|$|Newton, et al. cultured L. jordanis {{and various}} other species of Legionella in BCYE or ACES broth. <b>DNA</b> <b>extraction</b> and PCR {{amplification}} were done under standard conditions. However, due to low GC-content and the mismatching of base pairs, the temperature used during subtractive hybridization was adjusted to 35°C. Small amounts of biosynthetic enzymes L-cysteine synthase and acetyltransferase were detected in L. jordanis and L. pneumophila; 19 open reading frames (ORFs) were found in L. jordanis, {{with a range of}} punitive functions making up around 47.5% of the 41 sequences represented by 40 ORFs. L. jordanis was found to contain the gene loci sidH, sidE, sidB, and sidG which express an Dot/Icm effector protein. This effector protein is essential for L. pneumophila to infiltrate host cells, so it is thought {{to be used as a}} virulence factor in L. jordanis, also. Both strains of L. jordanis tested positive for proteolysis and hemolysis. They did not test positive for cytotoxicity. Several species of Legionella “produced different proteolytic cleavage patterns on synthetic peptide substrates.” This suggests some genetic differences exist between the proteases produced by the different species of Legionella, despite them having some similarities. L. jordanis also appears to contain complex chains of lipopolysaccharides. Legionella species use amino acids as both carbon and energy sources.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the police}} now had Taylor's DNA profile {{they were able}} to review other unsolved sex attacks in the {{locality}} where forensic evidence was still available for <b>DNA</b> <b>extraction.</b> Two rapes in particular stood out as they had both been committed on the estate where Taylor lived. The first took place on 18 October 1988 when a 32-year-old woman was attacked as she walked across Houghley Gill to collect her children from school. Taylor, who was wearing a mask and armed with a knife, forced her to carry out oral sex and then raped her. The second rape took place on 1 March 1989 when Taylor, again masked and wielding a knife, broke into the home of a 21-year-old woman {{in the middle of the}} day. He forced her into the bedroom, where he undressed her, blindfolded and gagged her, and then forced her to commit oral sex before raping her. Her small child was present in the house at the time. Taylor was formally rearrested in October 2002 and charged with the rapes. Although Taylor initially refused to cooperate with the police, the DNA evidence was overwhelming, and he eventually pleaded guilty to both rapes on 4 February 2003 at Leeds Crown Court. Judge Norman Jones QC, the Recorder of Leeds, sentenced him to two terms of life imprisonment and [...] "expressly dis-applied early release provisions". Det. Supt. Gregg said: [...] "We are still concerned that there may be other victims and families who have been affected by Taylor's actions" [...] and revealed that a diamante necklace found in his car at the time of his 2001 arrest may have belonged to another victim as they were still unable to find out where it came from or who it belonged to. Taylor is known to have travelled across the country to meet women he had contacted through personal ads and also in his parcel delivery work, and with the solving of the two rape cases police discounted his insistence that Tiernan's murder was an isolated case and that he had taken his dog for a walk and [...] "just snapped". They maintained that Taylor could have been a serial sex attacker for twenty years. Taylor has denied involvement in any other crimes.|$|E

40|$|All known {{species of}} Fergusonina flies (Fergusoninidae) {{participate}} in an obligate mutualism with Fergusobia nematodes (Neotylenchidae). From dissections, {{it is believed that}} all female third-instar larvae, pupae and adult female flies carry nematodes internally, while male adults and larvae do not. This observation of sex-limited association was tested using a molecular diagnostic approach. Nematode-specific primers were used for polymerase chain reaction amplification of a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene in order to screen <b>DNA</b> <b>extractions</b> from flies for the presence of nematode DNA. Consistent with evidence from dissections, nearly all extractions from adult female flies were positive for nematode DNA, while all <b>DNA</b> <b>extractions</b> from adult male flies were negative. Nearly half of late-instar larvae screened showed evidence of nematode DNA, consistent with the hypothesis that nematodes are only present within females.

To clarify their phylogenetic position, we amplified and sequenced the SSU rRNA gene obtained from four independent <b>DNA</b> <b>extractions</b> of A. flavum and three independent <b>DNA</b> <b>extractions</b> of A. wrightianum.

This newly described clade we named Amphitremida is diverse genetically, ecologically and physiologically.

This study compares HPC to culture-independent techniques for enumeration and identification of bacteria in environmental samples. Drinking water samples were collected from four different sites at two different times of year and analyzed using HPC, bacterial identification from 16 s ribosomal RNA gene sequences, and direct cell counts from epifluorescence microscopy. No significant correlation was found between HPC measurements and either direct cell counts or measures of sample biodiversity from sequence analysis. 16 s rRNA gene sequences from bulk <b>DNA</b> <b>extractions</b> reveal microbial communities in drinking water to comprise a broad array of bacterial diversity, including microbes of potential concern to human health such as mycobacteria.
