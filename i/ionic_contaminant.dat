50|$|When {{current is}} applied, by the direct power source, to the electrodes, {{migration}}s occur beneath the soil surface. Although {{there are many}} types of migrations that occur {{in tandem with the}} current there are two driving migrations within electrokinetics; ionic migration and electrophoresis. When the electrolytic solution is injected within the soil part of the ionic solution forms a diffuse double layer with soils and contaminants. This diffused double layer will aid in the ionic drift that will occur as the current passes though the soil and surrounding liquid, this process is called electroosmosis. The thickness of the diffused double layer is a function of ionic composition of bulk solution and the average charge density of hydration products. As the electrolyte concentration increases the diffuse double layer thickness decreases.Electrophoresis is the mass flux of charged particles under an electric field. Both processes work at the same time but in a counter current manner. The charged particles driven by electrophoresis flow from the cathode to the anode while electrolytic solution flows from the anode to the cathode. Of the two main processes electrophoresis (or electromigration) is more dominant than electroosmosis. Electrophoresis servies as the driving factor that induces the flow of electroosmosis in the opposite direction. Electromigration also serves as the major component for <b>ionic</b> <b>contaminant</b> removal. For electromigration to occur absorbed material must be dissolved to an ionic form whether they are metals, organic or inorganic particles. Electroosmotic flow between the electrodes promotes the development of a low-pH environment in the soil. This low pH environment inhibits metallic contaminants from being sorbed onto soil particle surfaces which aids in the formation of compounds making electrokinetics possible. By this thought it is possible to acidify the soil and induce the release of absorbed heavy metals.|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of groundwater resources {{is very important}} in the semiarid Sahel region, which is experiencing rapid urban development. Impacts of urbanization on groundwater resources were investigated in the unconfined aquifer of the Continental Terminal beneath the city of Niamey, Niger, using water level and chemical data. Hydrodynamic and chemical changes are best described by a combination of factors including the historical development of the city, current land use, water-table depth and topography. Seasonal groundwater recharge occurs with high spatial variability, as indicated by water-level monitoring in all wells, but there was no interannual trend over the 5 -year study period. Groundwater salinity shows high spatial variability and a minor rising trend. The highest salinity is in the old city centre, with Na-NO 3 dominant, and it increases seasonally with recharge. Salinity is much lower and more variable in the suburbs (Ca-HCO 3, Ca-NO 3, and Na-NO 3 dominant). Nitrate is the main <b>ionic</b> <b>contaminant</b> and is seasonally or permanently above the international guidelines for drinking water quality in 36 % of sampled wells, with a peak value of 112 mg L- 1 NO 3 -N (8 meq L- 1).

Therefore, {{it is essential}} to understand the level of ionic species on the electronic circuitry as well as the reliability risks caused by these contaminants. There are a number of approaches available in the industry to assess the reliability risks; for example, the water drop test (WDT) is one of the techniques used to determine the propensity of an <b>ionic</b> <b>contaminant</b> to cause electrical short failures by dendrite formation. The objective of this research is to determine the time to cause the failures, known as electrochemical migration (ECM) failures. A test vehicle was developed for the WDT to obtain the time to cause ECM failure in presence of different anions. The time to form dendritic bridges that cause short circuits was determined {{as a function of the}} different anions and the spacings between PCB pads. The experimental method involved dispensing aqueous solutions containing common inorganic and organic acid anions onto test vehicles, applying electrical bias voltages and measuring the time to form dendrites. Specially designed test structures cells were created to contain the test solutions. At each of the test cells, a cavity held the solution and constant current was applied through different metal geometries. To be representative of popular board finishes, test vehicle boards incorporated both Sn-Pb Hot Air Soldering Level (HASL) and Pb free HASL surface finishes...|$|E
40|$|In {{semiconductor}} manufacturing, a {{large amount}} (50 billion gallons for US semiconductor fabrication plants in 2006) of ultrapure water (UPW) is used to rinse wafers after wet chemical processing to remove ionic contaminants on surfaces. Of great concern are the contaminants left in narrow (tens of nm), high-aspect-ratio (5 : 1 to 20 : 1) features (trenches, vias, and contact holes). The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) stipulates that <b>ionic</b> <b>contaminant</b> levels be reduced to below ~ 10 ¹⁰ atoms/cm². Understanding the bottlenecks in the rinsing process would enable conservation of rinse water usage. A comprehensive process model has been developed on the COMSOL platform to predict the dynamics of rinsing of narrow structures on patterned SiO₂ substrates initially cleaned with NH₄OH. The model considers the effect of various mass-transport mechanisms, including convection and diffusion/dispersion, which occur simultaneously with various surface phenomena, such as adsorption and desorption of impurities. The influences of charged species in the bulk and on the surface, and their induced electric field that affect both transport and surface interactions, have been addressed. Modeling {{results show that the}} efficacy of rinsing is strongly influenced by the rate of desorption of adsorbed contaminants, mass transfer of contaminants {{from the mouth of the}} feature to the bulk liquid, and the trench aspect ratio. Detection of the end point of rinsing is another way to conserve water used for rinsing after wet processing. The applicability of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to monitor rinsing of Si processed in HF with and without copper contaminant was explored. In the first study, the effect of the nature of surface state (flat band, depletion, or accumulation) of silicon on rinsing rate was investigated. The experimental results show that the state of silicon could affect rinsing kinetics through modulation of ion adsorption. In the second study, silicon was intentionally contaminated by spiking HF with copper ions, cleaned in dilute HCl and then rinsed, and the entire process was followed by continuous impedance measurements. The measured impedance values at different stages have been correlated to the nature of the silicon surface, as characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) methods...|$|E
40|$|In silicon processing, {{contamination}} control {{is very important}} in each of the processing steps to ensure device reliability and enhance yield. There are many different types of contamination that are introduced at different processing steps from different sources. Industrial practice regarding {{contamination control}}, while effective, is not guided by a fundamental understanding of the systems involved. The objective of this work is to utilize the capability of a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) to investigate the fundamentals of contaminant adsorption and desorption, taking sulfate ion and benzotriazole (BTA) as examples, where the sulfate is a type of <b>ionic</b> <b>contaminant</b> and BTA is an organic contaminant. The study of sulfate adsorption onto silicon dioxide films was investigated in the context of front-end-of-line (FEOL) wet cleaning, specifically organic removal with a sulfuric acid/peroxide mixture (SPM). During SPM cleaning, high concentrations of sulfuric acid are used, and residual sulfate on the surface is generally removed by deionized (DI) water rinsing. The amount of sulfate adsorbed from potassium and sodium sulfate solutions was studied with QCM-D. The adsorption of sulfate was shown to result in the formation of multilayers with co-adsorption of cations. This adsorbed sulfate multilayered film was shown to be viscoelastic. The amount adsorbed increases linearly with sulfate concentration in the solution. The effect of temperature was studied, and sulfate uptake decreased with temperature, indicating sulfate adsorption is an exothermic reaction with a heat of adsorption in the range of − 15 − 11 kJ/mole. The desorption kinetics of sulfate during DI water rinsing was also investigated, and desorption rate constants were calculated to be 0. 04 s− 1 and 0. 12 s− 1, respectively, at two different DI water flow rates of 0. 2 mL/min and 1. 0 mL/min. The effect of temperature on sulfate desorption was shown to be minimal in the range of 22 to 50 °C. The study of BTA adsorption onto copper surfaces was investigated in the context of back-end-of-line (BEOL) wet processing, especially barrier chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) and post-CMP cleaning. BTA inhibits copper corrosion during barrier CMP by adsorbing onto copper surfaces to form a complex with copper. BTA adsorption from alkaline solutions was studied with QCM-D. Two types of oxides, Cu 2 O and CuO, were investigated. It was determined that BTA adsorption was highly dependent on the oxidation state of copper. BTA adsorbed much more onto the Cu 2 O surface than onto the CuO surface, indicating Cu(I) -BTA complex formation is the dominating passivation factor for copper. For both type of oxides, Cu 2 O and CuO, the adsorbed BTA layers were shown to be rigid and compact. The adsorption of BTA onto Cu 2 O in the presence of hydrogen peroxide was also measured. BTA complexing with Cu(I) dominated over the oxidation of Cu(I). BTA removal was studied by rinsing with tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and acetohydroxamic acid (AHA), and the QCM-D results indicate that BTA removal by pH 10 TMAH was not complete, whereas 1 ppm AHA solution was able to completely remove BTA in 10 min...|$|E

Experiments using 18 emerging contaminants were performed using membranes NF 200 and NF 90 at bench-scale units, and for a more complete study, results of NF and RO pilot and fullscale experiments where compared to our experimental results. The removal results showed that NF can remove many emerging contaminants.

Although reduction of water consumption by the industry is challenging, it {{can be accomplished by}} implementation of different strategies such as the reuse and recycling of water, the development of more efficient wet cleans and wet processes, and the conversion to dry process. The lack of a systematic approach to determine the optimum combination of water recycling and reusing and the optimum type of process configuration for recycle treatment need to be addressed in order to achieve more efficient water conservation. Specifically, multi-component interactions in ion exchange processes and the effect of these interactions on the separation efficiency have been neglected when dealing with water reusing and recycling. Ion exchange resins initially containing different concentrations of impurities were utilized in experiments to determine the effect that organic and <b>ionic</b> <b>contaminants</b> initially contained in the ion exchange resin have on the adsorption of ionic compounds. Experiments were performed with the tested ion exchange resins to determine the effect of organic compounds in the liquid phase. A combination of experimental and modeling methods were utilized to determine the fundamental equilibrium and kinetic parameters for ion-ion and/or ion-organic interactions. The concentrations under investigation are relevant to the ion exchange application in industrial ultra-pure water plants with. Experiments showed that adsorption of ionic compounds were affected by the amount of organic and <b>ionic</b> <b>contaminants</b> initially contained in the ion exchange resin. Additionally, experiments showed that the adsorption of organic compounds affects the capacity of the ion exchange resin, thus changing the efficiency of the system. The effect of organic impurities is not only due to the degradation of the exchange media, but also due to specific chemical interactions. These chemical interactions may enhance the adsorption kinetics; however, even in the case of kinetic enhancement, the key inhibition effect appears to be due to ionic transport effects, which cause pore and/or site blockage.

The system provides an alternative between high-frequency fiber-optic methods and low-frequency dielectric methods, combining optical-style precision and miniaturization with electrode simplicity and robustness. The system is important in overcoming quality control problems and improving uniformity in composite manufacture, particularly in critical structures, and in increasing production speed...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} accumulation f chloride {{and other}} ions on indoor zinc and aluminum surfaces in 15 U. S. cities has been measured. For most <b>ionic</b> <b>contaminants,</b> he accumulation zinc and aluminum surfaces is similar, suggesting that partic-ulate deposition isthe most likely mode of accumulation. Chloride accumulation aluminum occurs by particulate depo-sition, but on zinc surfaces, attack by reactive chlorine containing gases also contributes toaccumulation. I New York City and Philadelphia, chloride accumulation is very rapid on all zinc surfaces {{but not on}} aluminum surfaces. Volatilization of chloride, probably as HC 1 or NH 4 C 1, seems {{to contribute to the}} low chloride concentrations observed on aluminum surfaces in these cities. In Wichita and Houston, deposition of coarse chloride containing particulates produces rapid accumulation of chloride on horizontal zinc and aluminum surfaces while chloride accumulation on vertical surfaces is low. As part of a broad study to determine the amounts and effects of major inorganic pollutants in indoor environments (1, 2), the long-term accumulation of chloride on indoor zinc and a luminum surfaces at tele-phone company switching centers in 15 U. S. cities has been measured (3). In the previous reports (1, 2) o...|$|R
40|$|AbstractProtective {{corrosion}} resistant coatings serve for decreasing {{the amount of}} <b>ionic</b> <b>contaminants</b> from Havar® entrance foils of the targets for [18 F] production. The corrosion damage of coated entrance foils is caused mainly by the diffusion of highly reactive products of water radiolysis through the protective film toward Havar® substrate. Since amorphous metal alloys (metallic glasses) are well-known to perform a high corrosion resistance, the glass forming ability, microstructure and diffusion barrier efficiency of binary alloys containing chemically inert Nb, Ta, Zr were investigated. Nb–Ta, Nb–Zr and Ta–Zr films of different alloy composition and ∼ 1. 5 μm thickness were co-deposited by magnetron sputtering. Diffusion barrier efficiency tests used reactive aluminum underlayer and protons of acid solution and gallium atoms at elevated temperature as diffusing particles. Though co-sputtered Nb–Ta and Nb–Zr alloy films of different contents were crystalline, Ta–Zr alloy was found to form dense amorphous microstructures {{in a range of}} composition with 30 – 73 % atomic Ta. The diffusion barrier efficiency of Nb–Zr and Nb–Ta alloy coatings decreased with increase of Nb content. The diffusion barrier efficiency of sputtered Ta–Zr alloy coatings increased with the transition from nanocrystalline columnar microstructure to amorphous for coatings with 30 – 73 at. % Ta...|$|R
40|$|Electrokinetic {{remediation}} {{is generally}} an in situ method using direct current electric potentials to move <b>ionic</b> <b>contaminants</b> and/or water to collection electrodes. The method {{has been extensively}} studied for application in saturated clayey soils. Over the past few years, an electrokinetic extraction method specific for sandy, unsaturated soils has been developed and patented by Sandia National Laboratories. A RCRA RD&D permitted demonstration of this technology for the in situ removal of chromate contamination from unsaturated soils in a former chromic acid disposal pit was operated {{during the summer and}} fall of 1996. This large scale field test represents the first use of electrokinetics for the removal of heavy metal contamination from unsaturated soils in the United States and is part of the US EPA Superfund Innovative Technology Evaluation (SITE) Program. Guidelines for characterizing a site for electrokinetic remediation are lacking, especially for applications in unsaturated soil. The transference number of an ion is the fraction of the current carried by that ion in an electric field and represents the best measure of contaminant removal efficiency in most electrokinetic remediation processes. In this paper we compare the transference number of chromate initially present in the contaminated unsaturated soil, with the transference number in the electrokinetic process effluent to demonstrate the utility of evaluating this parameter...|$|R
40|$|Two {{test methods}} have been {{developed}} that detect and identify contaminants. T his article covers two test methods to detect and identify surface organic contamination on bare boards or assemblies that we feel are still not sufficiently known to this industry. They are excellent inspection and corrective action tools to help solve contamination problems. The “Detection ” method is simple and safe. {{and can be used}} right in the productionarea. with lirmted skilled personnel. The “Identification ” method is a little more complicated. The latter is a new laboratory analysis technique to identify the specific contaminant(s). After detecting surface contamination, the analysis pro-vides significant guidance to the process engineering and production groups for taking corrective action. The principle {{purpose of this article is}} to present a detailed iescription of the necessary materials and apparatus to perform 30 th test methods. Until now. the printed circuit industry has only had a practical neans for detecting <b>ionic</b> <b>contaminants.</b> Now, for the first ime (thanks to work done by Dr. Bill Kenyon and Ron Kiaer If DuPont Laboratories), we have these new and practical nethods. Both test {{methods have been}} approved by the IPC/ANSI and he Defense Electronics Supply Center for military specificaions...|$|R
30|$|Biochar is one {{emerging}} adsorbent {{formed via}} pyrolysis of biomaterials. Biochar has both high internal surface area and microporosity, {{and can be}} used as an adsorbent in separation and purification processes for gases, liquids, and colloidal solids (Zhang et al. 2013 a, b; Alslaibi et al. 2014; Gwenzi et al. 2014). The large surface area and cation or anion exchange capacity, determined to a large extent by feedstocks and pyrolysis conditions, enable enhanced sorption of both organic and inorganic contaminants to biochar surfaces. Although biochar has been reported to effectively remove cationic species, other studies (Wang et al. 2015) show that it has relatively low adsorption capacity for anions. One option to enhance anion adsorption capacity is to develop hybrid adsorbents incorporating a biochar matrix and metal oxide crystals. Metal oxide–biochar nano-composites represent an emerging group of adsorbents for removal of neutral and <b>ionic</b> <b>contaminants</b> in aqueous solutions. We tested the hypothesis that metal oxide–biochar nano-composites has higher adsorption capacity than biochar due to their hybrid nature comprising two solid phases (Zhang et al. 2012); a biochar matrix and nanocrystals of metal oxides, both of which contribute to adsorption of contaminants. Therefore, the objectives of the current study were: (1) to synthesise and characterise Fe 2 O 3 –biochar nano-composites; and (2) to evaluate their capacity to adsorb methyl orange dye using kinetic and equilibrium batch studies.|$|R
