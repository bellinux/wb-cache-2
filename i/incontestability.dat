During this period, a trademark owner may concurrently opt to file a Section 15, Declaration of <b>Incontestability.</b> A mark declared incontestable is immune from future challenge, except in instances where the mark becomes generic, the mark is abandoned, or if the registration was acquired fraudulently. Note, if the Section 8 Affidavit is filed during the 6-month grace period additional fees to file the Affidavit with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will apply.|$|E

Nevertheless, modern environmental legislation contains judicial review schemes similar to that upheld in Yakus.|$|E
5000|$|The {{terminology}} of acquired distinctiveness {{is accepted}} in the European Union and Commonwealth jurisdictions such as Australia, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom, and the common law jurisdiction of the United States (which also uses the term secondary meaning). In the U.S., if a trademark {{has been used for}} a continuous period of at least five years after the date of registration, the right to use the mark and the registration may become [...] "incontestable" [...] (e.g. invulnerable to cancellation for non-use, but not for becoming generic). In such cases the USPTO checks and confirms whether the request for <b>incontestability</b> meets formality requirements, but whether a registration is incontestable at law can only be determined during legal proceedings involving the registration.|$|E

5000|$|As {{with other}} {{insurance}}, {{an insurance policy}} {{is part of the}} insurance transaction. In mortgage insurance, a master policy issued to a bank or other mortgage-holding entity (the policyholder) lays out the terms and conditions of the coverage under insurance certificates. The certificates document the particular characteristics and conditions of each individual loan. The master policy includes various conditions including exclusions (conditions for denying coverage), conditions for notification of loans in default, and claims settlement. The contractual provisions in the master policy have received increased scrutiny since the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States. Master policies generally require timely notice of default include provisions on monthly reports, time to file suit limitations, arbitration agreements, and exclusions for negligence, misrepresentation, and other conditions such as pre-existing environmental contaminants. The exclusions sometimes have [...] "incontestability provisions" [...] which limit the ability of the mortgage insurer to deny coverage for misrepresentations attributed to the policyholder if twelve consecutive payments are made, although these <b>incontestability</b> provisions generally don't apply to outright fraud.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>incontestability</b> in American {{trademark}} law has caused great confusion ever since its adoption {{as part of}} United States trademark law in 1946. This Article is first {{a study of the}} rational basis for <b>incontestability</b> in American trademark law. The role of <b>incontestability</b> in the larger regime of American trademark law is established in order to understand <b>incontestability</b> as it fits within the history of the common law of trademarks. This is fundamental {{in order to understand the}} significance of the thesis that <b>incontestability</b> is illegitimate. Next, acquisition of <b>incontestability</b> is presented in order to show how simple it is to attain incontestable status and to put in perspective the resulting advantages. This also demonstrates the fact that <b>incontestability</b> is a radical departure from the common law of trademarks. This Article concludes with an analysis of trademarks themselves as property. Because the concept of <b>incontestability</b> was adopted without reference to the common law, and because it attempts to create property rights in a trademark itself, this Article concludes that <b>incontestability</b> is jurisprudentially illegitimate and should be repealed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Incontestability</b> is {{a nearly}} unique feature of American {{trademark}} law, {{with a unique}} American implementation. The concept of <b>incontestability</b> allows a trademark registrant to overcome arguments that a symbol is merely descriptive of features or qualities of the registrant’s goods or services—for example, “Juicy” for apples. <b>Incontestability</b> provides a nearly irrebuttable presumption of trademark meaning, which is {{a powerful tool for}} trademark owners. Unfortunately, <b>incontestability</b> is not granted as carefully as its power would counsel. Courts may misunderstand either the prerequisites for, or the meaning of <b>incontestability,</b> allowing trademark claimants to assert rights that they don’t actually have <b>Incontestability</b> needs clearer signals about what it is and when it is available. In the absence of serious substantive examination of <b>incontestability</b> at the PTO—which seems unlikely to materialize any time soon—changes designed to increase the salience of incontestability’s requirements to filers and to courts could provide some protection against wrongful assertions. <b>Incontestability</b> can only serve the trademark system if it is granted properly and consistently...|$|E
40|$|It is unchanging black letter {{law that}} a {{contract}} of insurance is {{a transfer of}} risk. The insurer collects premiums from a group and pools them to cover the losses and the operating costs of the insurer. Individuals fund the operation {{of a system that}} achieves a social good in an effective and efficient manner. The perfect operation of the system can be thwarted by free riders in two ways. First, when individuals who have chosen not to participate in the group attempt to transfer risk for a loss that already has occurred, the prevalence of the risk is altered in the group. Second, the system also is defeated to the extent that legitimate losses are not indemnified. Judicial doctrines have attempted to find solutions that balance the desire to protect innocent insureds with the desire to avoid encouraging insurance fraud. One of those doctrines is the so-called “first manifest” doctrine. This doctrine uses policy language to avoid <b>incontestability</b> facilitated fraud by allowing coverage, but limits the risks transferred to those intended by the contract. The doctrine allows the insurer to deny a specific claim for a concealed condition while allowing the insured to keep coverage under the policy in effect for any condition that was unknown to the applicant. This article discusses a recent leading case in the area, Paul Revere Life Insurance Co. v. Haas. Haas represents an example of a state supreme court making new law to achieve policy objectives. Analysis of Haas and similar cases in other jurisdictions suggests that the relevant policy factors behind both <b>incontestability</b> and exceptions to <b>incontestability</b> can be described in equation form. A review of historical trends suggests that those variables leading to legislative recognition of <b>incontestability</b> have been supplanted by other factors. In contrast, those variables leading to judicial exceptions to <b>incontestability,</b> including insurance fraud, have become more prominent. This perspective suggests that recent first manifest cases represent a judicial balancing of an equation thrown out of balance by rising insurance fraud. Finally, the economic perspective suggests that the doctrine is a more efficient way to achieve multiple policy goals than the legislative alternative available in some states...|$|E
40|$|The {{payment of}} life {{insurance}} policy benefits to the insured’s suriving spouse or child is something with which most people are both familiar and comfortable. However, when those benefits are instead paid to a third party investor who {{has no interest in}} the insured’s life, some people cry foul. Yet this is the basic premise of the secondary market for life insurance. In this market, insured individuals assign their policy benefits to an investor who agrees to pay the insured a lump sum of money in addition to assuming responsibility for the policy’s premiums. While the underlying concepts that support the secondary market for life insurance policies are not new, the young and imperfectly regulated market has been strained by an increase in supply and demand for these products. Because of the limited guidance within the market, fraud and uncertainty have pervaded many transactions. As a result, many validly settled policies may face challenges in the courts. In an effort to help stabilize and legitimize the secondary market, this Comment recommends coupling a strict judicial interpretation of the <b>incontestability</b> periods contained in many life insurance policies with a five year holding period on newly issued life insurance policies. This framework will help deter fraudulent transactions while promoting certainty among investors...|$|E
40|$|The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals’ {{trademark}} jurisprudence {{has been}} truly {{fair and balanced}} since the 1946 passage of the Lanham Act. The court has created this fair and balanced jurisprudence by creating firm standards and sticking to them. Although not the most popular circuit in which to find a trademark case, the Eighth Circuit has kept a constant vigil to assure that trademark plaintiffs do not dominate over trademark defendants. This balanced approach to trademark law {{is consistent with the}} Minnesota Supreme Court, which recently held that “advertising injury” included trademark infringement, and therefore the defendant’s insurance carrier had to defend a trademark infringement lawsuit against it. The Eighth Circuit appears mindful of the need to maintain an even playing field so that trademark owners’ rights can be respected but trademark defendants’ ability to compete is not unduly burdened. This conclusion is supported by the heightened scrutiny of secondary meaning, the improbability of finding a trademark diluted, the strict standard on infringement, the consistent application of the <b>incontestability</b> doctrine, and by the data regarding reported success rates of trademark infringement cases. In the end, this article concludes that the Eighth Circuit’s trademark jurisprudence will lead to further and faster economic recovery than other circuits because the courts protect legitimate trademark rights but not at the expense of competition...|$|E
40|$|American {{trademark}} law is expanding. The expansion {{began with}} {{the adoption of the}} Lanham Act in 1947. At that time and ever since, commentators and law makers alike referred to the Lanham Act as a codification of the existing common law. In fact, this codification was a selection and expansion of the common law. The United States has continued to expand trademark jurisprudence: from <b>incontestability,</b> to cybersquatting, to dilution - the notion {{of what it means to}} protect a trademark has continued to expand. During this time, the Commerce Clause on which American federal trademark protection is based has not changed. The result of this inextricable expansion is that trademark jurisprudence in the United States is becoming muddled. Originally, trademark protection was justified as a right of exclusion that was granted to the user of a sign for their exclusive use for as long as they used it and to the extent they used it. Now, the trademark right has come to resemble the moral right of attribution andlor integrity of civil law copyright systems. This may be appropriate if the nation had a purposeful debate or discussion on turning the United States trademark system into a system of moral rights. However, no such discussion has taken place. Rather, Congress has enlarged the trademark right at the behest of special interests without paying attention to the consequences. One consequence is that trademark jurisprudence now has a striking resemblance to that of the protection offered by moral rights in civil law countries...|$|E
40|$|This {{collection}} of arresting and innovative chapters applies {{the techniques of}} anthropology in analyzing {{the role played by}} Islam in the social lives of the world’s Muslims. The volume begins with an introduction that sets out a powerful case for a fresh approach to this kind of research, exhorting anthropologists to pause and reflect on when Islam is, and is not, a central feature of their informants’ life-worlds and identities. The chapters that follow are written by scholars with long-term, specialist research experience in Muslim societies ranging from Kenya to Pakistan and from Yemen to China: thus they explore and compare Islam’s social significance {{in a variety of settings}} that are not confined to the Middle East or South Asia alone. The authors assess how helpful current anthropological research is in shedding light on Islam’s relationship to contemporary societies. Collectively, the contributors deploy both theoretical and ethnographic analysis of key developments in the anthropology of Islam over the last 30 years, even as they extrapolate their findings to address wider debates over the anthropology of world religions more generally. Crucially, they also tackle the thorny question of how, in the current political context, anthropologists might continue conducting sensitive and nuanced work with Muslim communities. Finally, an afterword by a scholar of Christianity explores the conceptual parallels between the book’s key themes and the anthropology of world religions in a broader context. This volume has key contemporary relevance: for example, its conclusions on the fluidity of people’s relations with Islam will provide an important counterpoint to many commonly held assumptions about the <b>incontestability</b> of Islam in the public sphere...|$|E
40|$|We {{review the}} Bundeskartellamt (Federal Cartel Office Germany) {{decision}} on the proposed merger between Springer and ProSiebenSat. 1 from an economic point of view. In doing so, {{it is not our}} goal to analyse whether the controversial decision by the Bundeskar-tellamt has been correct or flawed from a legal point of view. Instead, we analyse whether the economic reasoning in the decision document reflects state-of-the-art economic theory on conglomerate mergers. Regarding such types of mergers, anticompetitive effects either do not occur regularly or are more often than not overcompensated by efficiency gains, so that a standard welfare perspective demands reluctance concerning antitrust interventions. This is particularly true if two-sided markets, like media markets, are involved. However, anticompe-titive conglomerate mergers are not impossible, in particular in neighbouring markets where there is some relationship between the products of the merging companies. In line with the more-economic approach in European merger control, a particular thorough line of argumen-tation, backed with particularly convincing economic evidence, is necessary to justify a pro-hibition of a conglomerate merger from an economic point of view. Against this background, we do not find the reasoning of the Bundeskartellamt entirely convincing and sufficiently strong to justify a prohibition of the proposed combination from an economic perspective. The reasons are that (i) the Bundeskartellamt fails to continuously consider consumer and customer welfare as the relevant standards, (ii) positive efficiency and welfare effects of cross-media strategies are neglected, (iii) in contrast, the competition agency sometimes ap-pears to view profitability of post-merger strategy options to be per se anticompetitive (effi-ciency offence), (iv) the <b>incontestability</b> of the relevant markets is not sufficiently substanti-ated, (v) inconsistencies occur regarding the symmetry of the TV advertising market duopoly versus the unique role of the BILD-Zeitung and (vi) the employment of modern economic instruments appears to be underdeveloped. Thus, we conclude that the Bundeskartellamt has not embraced the European more-economic approach in the analysed decision. However, one can discuss whether economic effects are overcompensated in this case by concerns about a reduction in diversity of opinion and threats to free speech. Similar to the Bundeskartellamt, we do not consider these concerns in our analysis. [...] merger control,media markets,more-economic approach,conglomerate mergers,cross-promotion...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{preliminary}} {{concern of}} this thesis {{is to show}} that the world of nature, upon which we as a species rely for our continuing survival, is being rapidly diminished. Given the <b>incontestability</b> of this deplorable state of current environmental degradation, the central objective of this thesis is to tease out the aetiology of the present environmental crisis by articulating the philosophical foundations upon which the purpose and pattern of our technological interactions with nature have been built. One of the fundamental causes of environmental destruction, I contend, is due to a philosophy of nature based upon our insatiable drive for power over nature. One facet of this drive for power is seen to emerge from both a contemporary western epistemology which sees knowledge as a form of power over nature, and a scientific methodology of reductio-mechanism which operates on the assumption that nature is a machine that can be pulled apart and then reassembled to suit human needs. Moreover, because the methodology of reductio-mechanistic science is one which has presupposed the separation of the ‘observer’ from the ‘observed’ (i. e. man from nature), we have further promulgated a sense of value neutrality in our technological interaction with the environment by affirming detachment, as opposed to participation, as the measure of ‘objectivity’ and ‘truth’. In contrast to this conventional position I submit that knowledge and its application is a value-laden process. The technologies of power which arise from the epistemology and methodology of power, have reconstructed and fabricated the world of nature in ways which make it more amenable to predictability. Laura has called this process ‘transformative subjugation’, and I shall argue that its implications for environmental education are momentous. One problem to be elaborated is that by virtue of reducing nature’s wholes into parts and then transforming or reconstituting those parts into inert, chemicalized, and even deadened things, we undermine the sense of conscience which attributes value to the integrity of functional wholes within nature and indeed to the whole of nature. We gain enormous control over the world by technologizing it. The problem is, however, that the control which we gain over nature comes at too high an ecological price. I shall argue in this thesis that the ostensible goal for environmental education is to serve the interests of ecological interconnectivity rather than the economic way of life dependent on the continual technologization of nature. It shall be made explicit that unless the form of educational knowledge we select is motivated by empathetic connectivity with nature rather than by a lust for power over nature, there is no place to go. Environmental education will simply reproduce, albeit in alluringly cosmetic ways, the same contexts of technological invasiveness and intrusion that have in the first place led to the desacrilization of nature...|$|E
