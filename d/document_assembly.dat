In large law firms <b>document</b> <b>assembly</b> systems are increasingly being used to systemise work, such as complex term sheets and the first drafts of credit agreements.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of the origin recognition complex (ORC) with replication origins is a critical parameter in eukaryotic replication initiation. In mammals the ORC remains bound except during mitosis, thus the localization of ORC complexes allows localization of origins. A monoclonal antibody that recognizes human ORC 1 was used to localize ORC complexes in populations of human MOLT- 4 cells separated by cell cycle position using centrifugal elutriation. ORC 1 staining in cells in early G 1 is diffuse and primarily peripheral. As the cells traverse G 1, ORC 1 accumulates and becomes more localized towards {{the center of the}} nucleus, however around the G 1 /S boundary the staining pattern changes and ORC 1 appears peripheral. By mid to late S phase ORC 1 immunofluorescence is again concentrated at the nuclear center. During anaphase, ORC 1 staining is localized mainly in the pericentriolar regions. These findings suggest that concerted movements of origin DNA sequences in addition to the previously <b>documented</b> <b>assembly</b> and disassembly of protein complexes are an important aspect of replication initiation loci in eukaryotes...|$|R
