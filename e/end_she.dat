5|$|SM U-22 {{was built}} at the Hungarian UBAG yard and was {{launched}} on 27 January 1917, {{the last of the}} class to be launched. The still-incomplete boat sank in the harbor at Fiume in June 1917, but was raised, repaired, and relaunched in October. From her November commissioning, U-22 conducted patrols off the Po River estuary and, later, northern Adriatic patrols from Trieste. After three months of repairs for her failed electric motor in mid 1918, U-22 resumed service, patrolling the Montenegrin coast out of Cattaro. In port at Cattaro at war's <b>end,</b> <b>she</b> was ceded to France as a war reparation and broken up. U-22 sank no ships during the war.|$|E
5|$|According to the London Naval Treaty, {{the ship}} was {{to be removed from}} front-line service. To this <b>end,</b> <b>she</b> had her main battery guns removed and she was {{converted}} into a radio-controlled target ship. She was redesignated AG-16, and served in this capacity after 1931. In the mid-1930s, she was rebuilt again, as an anti-aircraft gunnery training ship. In 1941, additional anti-aircraft guns were installed to increase her training capacity. Later in 1941, she was transferred to the US Pacific Fleet and based in Pearl Harbor. She was present in Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941; after having been hit by two torpedoes, she capsized and sank. A few years later, the hull was partially righted and towed closer to Ford Island, where the wreck remains today.|$|E
5|$|Following {{participation}} in the 1893 International Naval Review at Hampton Roads, Bennington moved north for operations {{along the coast of}} New England before beginning preparations for foreign service.

She cruised the Mediterranean, visiting various ports along its shores, for the next six months. In February 1894, orders arrived sending her to the Pacific. On the 18th, the gunboat transited the Strait of Gibraltar and headed back across the Atlantic. After steaming around Cape Horn and stopping at several Latin American ports, the warship finally arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 30 April.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to her law firm work, Sotomayor found visible public service roles. She was not connected to the party bosses that typically picked people for such jobs in New York, and indeed she was registered as an independent. Instead, District Attorney Morgenthau, an influential figure, served as her patron. In 1987, Governor of New York Mario Cuomo appointed Sotomayor {{to the board of}} the State of New York Mortgage Agency, which she served on until 1992. As part of one of the largest urban rebuilding efforts in American history, the agency helped low-income people get home mortgages and to provide insurance coverage for housing and AIDS hospices. Despite being the youngest member of a board composed of strong personalities, she involved herself in the details of the operation and was effective. She was vocal in supporting the right to affordable housing, directing more funds to lower-income home owners, and in her skepticism about the effects of gentrification, although in the <b>end</b> <b>she</b> voted in favor of most of the projects.|$|E
5|$|Lesbians {{depicted}} in literature were relatively {{rare in the}} 1950s. It was the publisher's policy in any novel involving lesbianism that the characters would never receive any satisfaction from the relationship. One or both usually ended up committing suicide, going insane, or leaving the relationship. Marijane Meaker discusses this in the 2004 foreword of Spring Fire: she was told by editor Dick Carroll that because the books were distributed by the U.S. Post Office instead of private companies delivering directly to stores, postal inspectors would send the books back to the publisher if homosexuality was depicted positively. The Postal Service relaxed their censorship after several First Amendment obscenity trials, including Roth v. United States and another regarding Allen Ginsberg's Howl in the mid-1950s, which gave Bannon a modicum of freedom in her plots. Although the ending to Odd Girl Out did not veer {{too far from the}} unsatisfactory resolution formula of Spring Fire, Women's Barracks, and Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness, it examined Laura's internal struggle in the realization that despite her femininity, she was deeply in love with another woman, and at the <b>end</b> <b>she</b> embraced it, which was rare in lesbian fiction.|$|E
5|$|On 17 August 1563, Charles IX was {{declared}} of {{age at the}} Parlement of Rouen, {{but he was never}} able to rule on his own and showed little interest in government. Catherine decided to launch a drive to enforce the Edict of Amboise and revive loyalty to the crown. To this <b>end,</b> <b>she</b> set out with Charles and the court on a progress around France that lasted from January 1564 until May 1565. Catherine held talks with Jeanne d'Albret, the Protestant queen regnant of Navarre (and the wife of Antoine de Bourbon) at Mâcon and Nérac. She also met her daughter Elisabeth at Bayonne near the Spanish border, amidst lavish court festivities. Philip II excused himself from the occasion. He sent the Duke of Alba to tell Catherine to scrap the Edict of Amboise and to find punitive solutions to the problem of heresy.|$|E

5|$|SM U-10 was {{the lead}} boat of the U-10 class of {{submarines}} for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, but was originally named UB-1 {{as a part of}} the German Imperial Navy. She was laid down on 1 November 1914 in Germany and shipped by rail to Pola where she was assembled and launched on 22 January 1915. Commissioned one week later as SM UB-1, she sank one Italian torpedo boat in her German service. In July, she was handed over to the Austro-Hungarian Navy and commissioned as SM U-10. She was the target of an unsuccessful torpedo attack by a British submarine in May 1917. In July 1918, U-10 hit a mine and was beached with heavy damage. She was towed to Trieste for repairs which remained unfinished at the war's <b>end.</b> <b>She</b> was handed over to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920.|$|E
5|$|The Countess {{was left}} rich under Leicester's will; yet the {{discharge}} of his overwhelming debts diminished her wealth. In 1604–1605 she successfully defended her widow's rights in court when her possessions and her good name were threatened by the Earl's illegitimate son, Robert Dudley, who claimed that he was his father's legitimate heir, thus implicitly declaring her marriage bigamous. Lettice Knollys was always close to her large family circle. Helpless at the political eclipse of her eldest son, the second Earl of Essex, she lost both him and her third husband to the executioner in 1601. From the 1590s she lived chiefly in the Staffordshire countryside, where, in reasonably good health until the <b>end,</b> <b>she</b> died at age 91 on Christmas Day 1634.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Traktor, and was developed as an independent video from the film but contained Bond influences. It depicts Madonna as a prisoner in a torture chamber, alternating with scenes of a fencing duel between good (clad in white) and evil (clad in black) personas of the singer. Wounds inflicted on both fencers are mirrored on the imprisoned Madonna, and in the <b>end</b> <b>she</b> escapes being electrocuted in the chamber. The usage of Jewish religious texts and objects in the music video led to controversy, with scholars of Judaism deeming it sacrilegious. Madonna has included the song on two of her world tours; the first being the 2004 Re-Invention World Tour and again as a video interlude on the 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour.|$|E
