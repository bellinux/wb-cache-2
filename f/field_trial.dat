5|$|Florence Nagle (26 October 1894– 30 October 1988) was {{a trainer}} and breeder of racehorses, a breeder of {{pedigree}} dogs, and an active feminist. Nagle purchased her first Irish Wolfhound in 1913, {{and went on}} to own or breed twenty-one United Kingdom Champions. Best in Show at Crufts in 1960 was awarded to Sulhamstead Merman, who was bred, owned and exhibited by Nagle. She also competed successfully in field trials with Irish Setters, from the 1920s until the mid-1960s resulting in eighteen <b>Field</b> <b>Trial</b> Champions. The male dog who was a linchpin in the 1970s revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed was descended from one of Nagle's Irish Setters.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009, India ordered 12 AW101 {{to serve}} as {{executive}} transport helicopters for the Indian President and Prime Minister. The selection followed <b>field</b> <b>trial</b> assessments between the AW101 and the Sikorsky S-92 held in 2008. However, the procurement was put on hold and subsequently cancelled due to the 2013 Indian helicopter bribery scandal, in which Finmeccanica, AgustaWestland's parent company, were accused of using bribery to win the contract. The three helicopters delivered {{as part of the}} contract may be returned to the manufacturer as part of the arbitration process.|$|E

5|$|Salk's vaccine {{was then}} {{used in a}} test called the Francis <b>Field</b> <b>Trial,</b> led by Thomas Francis, the largest medical {{experiment}} in history at that time. The test began with approximately 4,000 children at Franklin Sherman Elementary School in McLean, Virginia, and would eventually involve 1.8 million children, in 44 states from Maine to California. By {{the conclusion of the}} study, roughly 440,000 received one or more injections of the vaccine, about 210,000 children received a placebo, consisting of harmless culture media, and 1.2 million children received no vaccination and served as a control group, who would then be observed to see if any contracted polio.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} the <b>field</b> <b>trial</b> were {{announced}} 12 April 1955 (the tenth anniversary {{of the death of}} President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose paralytic illness was generally believed to have been caused by polio). The Salk vaccine had been 60–70% effective against PV1 (poliovirus type 1), over 90% effective against PV2 and PV3, and 94% effective against the development of bulbar polio. Soon after Salk's vaccine was licensed in 1955, children's vaccination campaigns were launched. In the U.S, following a mass immunization campaign promoted by the March of Dimes, the annual number of polio cases fell from 35,000 in 1953 to 5,600 by 1957. By 1961 only 161 cases were recorded in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Traditional desert farming {{systems have}} long been {{established}} in North Africa, irrigation being {{the key to success}} in an area where water stress is a limiting factor to growth. Techniques that can be used include drip irrigation, the use of organic residues or animal manures as fertilisers and other traditional agricultural management practises. Once fertility has been built up, further crop production preserves the soil from destruction by wind and other forms of erosion. It has been found that plant growth-promoting bacteria play a role in increasing the resistance of plants to stress conditions and these rhizobacterial suspensions could be inoculated into the soil {{in the vicinity of the}} plants. A study of these microbes found that desert farming hampers desertification by establishing islands of fertility allowing farmers to achieve increased yields despite the adverse environmental conditions. A <b>field</b> <b>trial</b> in the Sonoran Desert which exposed the roots of different species of tree to rhizobacteria and the nitrogen fixing bacterium Azospirillum brasilense with the aim of restoring degraded lands was only partially successful.|$|E

5|$|Herd numbers {{grew from}} 28 to over 165 between 1968 and 1997 and {{overgrazing}} negatively impacted their living environment. To manage population numbers, long-term, non-hormonal contraceptives have been employed, proving 95 percent effective over a seven-year <b>field</b> <b>trial.</b> The contraceptive, which {{began to be}} used at a management level in 1995 although it was used in smaller amounts as early as 1989, has also proven effective at improving the health and increasing the life expectancy of older mares through the removal of pregnancy and lactation-related stress. Since 1990, general herd health has improved, early mortality has decreased and older ponies are now found, with many {{over the age of}} 20 and some even over 25. No horse has ever been injured during the dart-administered treatments, although there is a 0.2 percent rate of abscess at the injection site, which normally heals within two weeks. Each mare between two and four years old is given contraceptives, and treatment is then withdrawn until she produces a foal. Once she has produced enough foals to be well represented genetically within the herd, she is placed on a yearly treatment plan until her death. After the introduction of the contraceptive, herd numbers continued to rise to a high of 175 in 2001 to 2005, but then dropped significantly to around 130 in 2009. In 2009, a study determined that mitochondrial DNA diversity in the herd was quite low, most likely due to their isolation, but that their nuclear genetic diversity remained at a level similar to that of breeds from the mainland.|$|E

40|$|All {{programmes}} set up {{to develop}} agricultural production have a common goal: the introduction of improved techniques which are adapted to the local climate, economically viable and acceptable to small farmers. Before laboratory results can be applied in the field, they must be tested under real growing conditions so their true value becomes clear and the optimal conditions for their widespread application can be determined. Such <b>field</b> <b>trials</b> must be planned, carried out and analysed in a methodical way. The West German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) has published a handbook on <b>field</b> <b>trials</b> by Klaus Rohrmosen, which CTA helped to make available in English. There are very few practical books on this subject, and the GTZ manual fills this gap. It covers all the basic procedures for conducting <b>field</b> <b>trials.</b> It {{can be used as}} a teachyourself handbook, or as a reference book, and is a useful guide to the different types of equipment needed for <b>field</b> <b>trials.</b> The section on the evaluation of results is presented very simply and limits itself to the essentials.
