5|$|Critics {{reported}} that players rarely {{need to use}} Undead Nightmare new weapons. Whitehead (Eurogamer) said that Marston's firearms are mostly indistinguishable apart from the blunderbuss, which is only useful when the player is overrun by zombies. GameSpot added that the game's combat is repetitive and less <b>fun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> expansion, as zombies barely pose a threat. The zombies, without guns, cover, horses, lack the complexities of cowboys and, apart {{from some of the}} special zombie types, are only a threat at short distances. The reviewer found little variation between weapons when firing at close range, which is more effective than aiming at a distance. The fun of the new guns quickly faded for the critic, who found little incentive to use traditional gunfight strategies. Whitehead (Eurogamer) too noted that the base game relied on its use of cover during gunfights, which the expansion jettisons altogether. Thus the player is forced into the technique of backtracking and turning to use the time-slowing Dead Eye mode to clear zombies with headshots. The reviewer also found the controls clumsy and often tripped on piles of zombie bodies or became stuck in doorways. While the idea of zombie animals scared Whitehead, he was both relieved and disappointed to find that bears and cougars, like the humans, died with a single bullet.|$|E

500|$|Grimaldi became [...] "easily {{the most}} popular English {{entertainer}} of his day". The Victoria and Albert Museum and the actor Simon Callow have both concluded that no other Clown achieved Grimaldi's level of fame. Richard Findlater, author of a 1955 Grimaldi biography, commented: [...] "Here is Joey the Clown, the first of 10,000 Joeys who took their name from him; here is the genius of English <b>fun,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> holiday splendour of his reign at Sadler's Wells and Covent Garden... during his lifetime [...] was generally acclaimed as the funniest and best-loved man in the British theatre." [...] A later biographer, Andrew McConnell Stott, wrote that [...] "Joey {{had been the first}} great experiment in comic persona, and by shifting the emphasis of clowning from tricks and pratfalls to characterisation, satire and a full sense of personhood, he had established himself as the spiritual father of all those later comedians whose humour stems first and foremost from a strong sense of identity." ...|$|E
500|$|Sam Wollaston for The Guardian said he {{was missing}} the interplay between Rodney and Del Boy from the original, {{and that the only}} <b>fun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> drama was [...] "recognising the nods, working out who's who and how it all fits into place. Otherwise, it's pretty lame." [...] The Daily Mirrors Jim Shelley didn't find the storyline [...] "interesting or convincing", finding Lyndhurst's {{performance}} as Freddie [...] "laughable" [...] and saying it was [...] "bizarre" [...] that the storyline [...] "virtually abandoned its main character (the young Del Boy) and its best actor (the engaging James Buckley from The Inbetweeners) who played him". In The Independent, Tom Sutcliffe said that [...] "the narrative's focus was blurred and the pacing weirdly off – quite {{a lot of the time}} you were well ahead of the drama and hanging around for it to catch up with you". Benji Wilson from The Daily Telegraph also wasn't impressed saying the viewer would have been disappointed if they [...] "tuned in wanting to be entertained, enthused, or anything in between", and that it was an [...] "ocean-going stinker".|$|E

We've been used to making a certain type of music and using sounds to accomplish that. So to break out of that and push ourselves to grow is definitely challenging." [...] Shinoda later said the album was not a concept record, saying, [...] "People asked us if it's a concept record, {{and in the middle of}} the process, we were contemplating whether or not that was what we wanted to do," [...] although he said that eventually, A Thousand Suns at its completion has no narrative and is [...] "more abstract" [...] than many concept albums.|$|E

The music was also a source of praise, and was noted as such in the IGN reviews and the GameSpot reviews, which called it an [...] "excellent symphonic soundtrack" [...] with terrific melodies. GameSpot, in their review, also praised the game's story as [...] "epic", in contrast to many of the other reviews, though they noted that Rush wasn't [...] "the most interesting leading man" [...] and preferred when the story focused on the Conqueror.|$|E

500|$|There's a Riot Goin' On was {{met with}} a divided {{reaction}} from fans and music critics, who {{were not used to}} the album's production and lyrical content.

Other major music publications praised this new direction: in his review for Rolling Stone magazine, Vince Aletti wrote that [...] "At first I hated it for its weakness and its lack of energy and I still dislike these qualities. But then I began to respect the album's honesty". Aletti cited it as [...] "one of the most important fucking albums this year" [...] and [...] "the new urban music... not about dancing to the music, in the streets. It's about disintegration, getting fucked up, nodding, maybe dying.

[...] A columnist for Hit Parader magazine gave Riot a favorable review, and stated that the album has [...] "a lot that makes Sly the in-person rave that he is." [...] In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said [...] "what's expressed is the bitterest ghetto pessimism", backed by [...] "subtle production techniques and jarring song compositions".

500|$|In 2010, Sheen had a {{supporting}} role in the science fiction sequel [...] Referring to his David Bowie-esque character, Sheen has said, [...] "I was paid to show off basically".

The Daily Telegraph felt his [...] "lively hamming as a cane-swishing nightclub owner merely underlines how impersonal—how inhuman—much else here is". However, USA Today felt his [...] "scenery-chewing performance ... is meant as comic relief, but this movie thunders along so seriously that the attempt at humor feels jarring". In other 2010 film work, Sheen provided the voices for characters in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland and Disney's Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue and appeared as a terrorist in Unthinkable. On television, Sheen's performance in the third instalment of Peter Morgan's Blair trilogy, The Special Relationship, was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor – Miniseries or Movie. The HBO film examined the [...] "special relationship" [...] between the US and the UK in the political era of Blair and Bill Clinton. It was the sixth collaboration between Sheen and Peter Morgan; both parties have since said they will not work together again [...] "for the foreseeable future". Sheen also made a guest appearance in four episodes of NBC's 30 Rock as Wesley Snipes, a love interest for Tina Fey's Liz Lemon. Fey, the sitcom's star and creator, has said that [...] "he was so funny and delightful to work with". In November 2010, Sheen received the BAFTA Britannia Award for British Artist of the Year.|$|E
500|$|To help {{train the}} dog playing Vincent for the episode's needed scenes, Madison {{was given the}} fake arm to take home and play with; when finally brought on the set, the crew had {{difficulty}} shooting her because Madison would bring and drop off the arm slightly differently each time, causing trouble recreating the same camera angles. Actor Daniel Dae Kim described their scenes with the beer in the DVD special features, [...] "The comedic scenes with Josh were {{so much fun to}} play because it was a lighter side. A nice change of pace." [...] Like their characters, the actors had not been in scenes together in a while, so Dae Kim thought it [...] "was fun to catch up and have <b>fun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process". The episode featured Hurley driving a bus down a hill. To create this scene, Garcia had to drive the bus down a small hill [...] "very stead" [...] to ensure the cameraman could record it all; towards the end however, they told Garcia to just [...] "go for it", allowing him to [...] "cut loose a little". For the close-up shots of Garcia and Dominic Monaghan, the production crew would shake the bus to simulate driving, and brush various pieces of foliage across the windshield to make it seem the bus was hitting bushes or trees. A stunt double standing in for Garcia performed the largest hill in the drive down; they were unable to rehearse due to getting rained out, so their first rehearsal was done on film. Dae Kim commented that [...] "it was just great to have as much fun on camera as we do off camera", {{and that there was no}} real acting that day, as they were all enjoying themselves as much as their characters.
