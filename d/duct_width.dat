RESULTS: We included 15 HP patients, with a mean age of 32. 5 years (range, 9 - 61 years) and mean disease duration of 24. 1 years (range, 6 - 42 years). In total, 152 imaging studies were reviewed.

Parametric studies were carried out using CFD simulations, and ANN models were trained using simulation results. A mathematical relationship was developed between six design parameters and area-weighted local average Nusselt numbers. It was observed that average Nusselt number was not affected by the turbulence intensity of air at the inlet, the surface temperature variation, nor the size of the outlet section of the duct. However, the heat convection was influenced by the <b>duct</b> length, <b>width,</b> and height; the size of the inlet; the temperature difference between inlet air and surface; air velocity; mode of operation.

It is assumed that a fully developed flow has already been set up in the duct before localised heating on one wall causes the flow to be changed by the action of buoyancy forces, as measured by the mixed convection parameter, lambda. An analytical solution is derived for the case when both the Peclet number, Pe, and lambda are of O(1). It is found that reversed flow appears at leading order when lambda > 2. This is confirmed by numerical integrations of the governing equations, for P = epsilonPe = 100 and a range of values of lambda, where epsilon [...] > 0 and Pe = O (epsilon(- 1)). The limiting cases of P 1 (boundary layer) with lambda variable and lambda [...] > infinity (free convection limit) are also studied.

We develop an accelerated boundary integral implementation adapted to general geometries and boundary conditions. A global spectral {{method is adopted}} to resolve {{the dynamics of the}} capsule membrane developing elastic tension according to the neo-Hookean constitutive law and bending moments in an inertialess flow. The simulations show that the trajectory of the capsule closely follows the underlying streamlines independently of the capillary number. The membrane deformability, on the other hand, significantly influences the relative area variations, the advection velocity and the principal tensions observed during the capsule motion. The evolution of the capsule velocity displays a loss of the time-reversal symmetry of Stokes flow due to the elasticity of the membrane. The velocity decreases while the capsule is approaching the corner as the background flow does, reaches a minimum at the corner and displays an overshoot past the corner due to the streamwise elongation induced by the flow acceleration in the downstream branch.

The slide rule, however, is also relatively inaccurate. This means the ductwork is designed with a higher static pressure and greater noise and turbulence than is necessary. A computer model helps to resolve these problems, reducing the fan horsepower needed to deliver the air. Computer optimization also reduces noise and the high rate of heat transfer caused by turbulent flow in abrupt dynamic transitions. The result is energy savings at the fan, chiller and boiler. There are also first cost savings because of smaller ducts and transitions. The design screen of the computer program is a simple Cartesian coordinate system with velocity and static pressure as the axes.

The purpose of this thesis work was to evaluate if the ESH could meet the European and Swedish passive house classification in Sibernik, Ljubljana, Lund, Östersund, Sundsvall and Kiruna. The purpose was also to make a sensitivity analysis of different energy efficiency measures in the energy performance of the building. This analysis was conducted to understand which of the selected energy efficiency measures made the most significant improvements in the results. The measures included in the sensitivity analysis were the building envelopes wall insulation thickness, changing the window frames, altering the ventilation air <b>duct</b> length and <b>width</b> as well as increasing the air duct insulation thickness. Finally, simulations with solar panels {{on the roof of the}} ESH were carried out. For the European passive house classification, the study involved constructing the model in the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) and simulating each region and energy efficiency measures separately. PHPP is however made specifically for verifying buildings according to the European passive house standard. So the demands for the Swedish passive house classification cannot be calculated in the PHPP simulations. Because of this, the data available through PHPP was used to manually calculate the Swedish passive house requirements. The results showed that the original ESH model, was only passive house certifiable according to the European classification in Sibernik. When including the additional energy efficiency measures it was possible for the ESH to become passive house certifiable in Lund, Ljubljana and Sibernik. The Swedish passive house classification results suggests that the ESH may be passive house certifiable in Lund. Also, with additional energy efficiency measures the ESH may meet the passive house requirements in Sundsvall and Kiruna. However, all the passive house classification parameters could not be considered in this study. Accordingly, additional analysis are required to draw final conclusions on whether the ESH building could meet the Swedish passive house certification in the different Swedish climate zones. The conclusions drawn were that all the energy efficiency measures contribute to reducing the primary energy demand, heating demand and the heating load. However, these same energy efficiency measures would at the same time increase the cooling demand. Because of this, it was discussed that specific regional models should be made. Because some regional models might benefit from not including the energy efficiency measures used in this thesis at all. They might instead benefit from finding and implementing energy efficiency measures that reduce the cooling demand...|$|R
