A new mathematical formulation for the CRAP is proposed which takes into account the regulations and the <b>internal</b> <b>agreements.</b> While current solutions make use of Artificial Intelligence techniques run on main frame computers, a low cost approach is proposed to provide on-line efficient solutions to face perturbed operating conditions. The proposed solution method uses a dynamic programming approach for the duties scheduling problem and when applied to the case of a medium airline while providing efficient solutions, shows good potential acceptability by the operations staff. This optimization scheme can then be considered as the core of an on-line Decision Support System for crew reserve assignment operations management...|$|R

500|$|It was {{announced}} for a release in North America {{under the title}} Muramasa: The Demon Blade in October 2008 for a release the following year. The game was originally being published by Xseed Games, but in April 2009 they announced that they were dropping the title from their schedule. Publishing rights were transferred to Ignition Entertainment. Ignition Entertainment later explained {{that it was in}} hot competition with Xseed and Atlus to acquire the American publishing rights, and after seeing Muramasa at TGS 2008 they were encouraged to apply for the rights. The change between publishers was an <b>internal</b> <b>agreement</b> between Xseed, their parent company Marvelous USA, and Ignition. The situation was amicably resolved as Xseed already had a large number of Wii titles lined up, and giving Muramasa to another publisher allowed multiple titles not to be overlooked when it came to Western publicity. The game released in North America on September 8, 2009. The game's localization was done by external localization companies in close collaboration with Ignition Entertainment. Due to the game's strong Japanese atmosphere, it was seen as a hard sell in the West, but during localization a lot of work went into preserving it rather than adjusting it for Western tastes. Due to this, the game was not dubbed into English, but instead retained its Japanese voice track while text was localized. An aspect Ignition worked hard with was to make sure the localization was of good quality by working closely with their chosen localization partners. This was due to backlash received by fans and critics over the [...] "lackluster" [...] localization of Lux-Pain, which had been beyond their control during development.|$|E

50|$|Notice {{that the}} {{guarantee}} just described embodies what {{may seem to}} be a contradiction. We know that timeout cannot be used to detect failures accurately. Yet virtual synchrony lets the user treat failure notifications (view changes) as trustworthy, infallible events. The key insight is that virtual synchrony is implemented by a software system that creates an abstraction within which the user's code is executed. Thus, failure detection by the platform (using timeouts) triggers an <b>internal</b> <b>agreement</b> protocol (within the platform). Only when this protocol terminates is a fault event delivered to the application. The application is spared from needing to implement the agreement mechanism, and sees a simple and seemingly accurate fault notification event.|$|E
