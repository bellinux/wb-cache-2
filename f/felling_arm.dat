5000|$|Caldbeck <b>Fells,</b> <b>Arm</b> Oâ€™Grain: A {{variety of}} {{supergene}} minerals occur as microscopic crystals at <b>Arm</b> O'Grain, Caldbeck <b>Fells.</b> These include mimetite, pyromorphite, vanadinite, duftite, plumbogummite and beudantite, {{as well as}} mottramite [...] Mottramite is the commonest of them. It occurs as black elongated boat shaped crystals up to about one mm long, scattered over white vein quartz. Occasionally, crusts of mottramite occur in cavities in the quartz that {{appear to have been}} formed by the dissolution of baryte. Mottramite was almost certainly produced by oxidation of galena.Journal of the Russell Society (2006) 9:44-53 ...|$|R

60|$|She turned; her <b>arm</b> <b>fell</b> {{over his}} shoulder; she buried {{her head in}} his breast.|$|R
60|$|He {{stretched}} his arm straight out, pointing abeam for a time, then his <b>arm</b> <b>fell</b> slowly.|$|R
60|$|The man ceased; his <b>arms</b> <b>fell</b> listlessly by his side, and {{his chin}} sank on his breast.|$|R
60|$|She sank on {{her knees}} {{by the side of}} his chair, and her <b>arms</b> <b>fell</b> upon his shoulders.|$|R

60|$|Wilding's hand <b>fell</b> on his <b>arm,</b> and its grasp was steady. Wilding's {{eyes met}} his, and their gaze was calm.|$|R
60|$|Then {{it seemed}} as if the room and {{everything}} in it swam round her, and she <b>fell</b> into Rachel's <b>arms.</b>|$|R
60|$|This was so {{unexpected}} {{that the}} prince's <b>arm</b> <b>fell</b> helplessly {{to his side}} at the sound, and he stood motionless.|$|R

60|$|A figure {{stepped out}} {{from among the}} trees, and Mary <b>fell</b> into his <b>arms.</b> A few minutes later, she re-entered the room.|$|R
60|$|But as {{he reached}} the palace there was a quick step behind him, and a hand <b>fell</b> upon his <b>arm.</b> He turned.|$|R
60|$|His <b>arm</b> <b>fell</b> {{downward}} by his side; he turned; {{and moved}} towards {{them with a}} steady step, the man he had been before.|$|R

60|$|Girty {{tried to}} strike the buzzard as he sailed close by, but his <b>arm</b> <b>fell</b> useless. He tried to scream, but his voice failed.|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him one moment with that still earnestness {{peculiar}} to herself, and then <b>fell</b> into his <b>arms.</b> [...] "O my son, my son!" ...|$|R
60|$|She also <b>fell</b> {{into the}} <b>arms</b> of Grace, {{and kissed her}} with effusion; and John saw the sisterly union, which he had anticipated, auspiciously commencing.|$|R

60|$|He stooped over her, and her raised <b>arms</b> <b>fell</b> {{upon his}} shoulders. He lifted her up, steadied himself {{and began to}} walk, looking {{straight}} before him.|$|R
60|$|The <b>arms</b> <b>fell</b> and {{the flame}} sank. Up they went again, and the broad tongue of fire shot up after them; {{and then again}} they fell.|$|R

Tensions rose at the junction of Tim Mei Avenue and Harcourt Road after the police used pepper spray. As night <b>fell,</b> <b>armed</b> riot police advanced from Wan Chai towards Admiralty and unfurled a banner that stated [...] "Warning, Tear Smoke". Seconds later, at around 6 pm, shots of tear gas were fired. The heavy-handed policing, {{including the use of}} tear gas on peaceful protesters, inspired tens of thousands of citizens to join the protests in Admiralty that night. Containment errors by the police - the closure of Tamar Park and Admiralty Station - caused a spill-over {{to other parts of the}} city, including Wan Chai, Causeway Bay and Mong Kok. 3,000 protesters occupied a road in Mong Kok and 1,000 went to Causeway Bay. The total number of protesters on the streets swelled to 80,000, at times considerably exceeding 100,000.|$|R

6000|$|... '"Father--devil!" [...] murmured the convict {{between his}} set teeth. He rushed wildly forward, and clenched {{the old man}} by the throat--but he was his father; and his <b>arm</b> <b>fell</b> {{powerless}} by his side.|$|R
