40|$|Background. Since 1996 {{there have}} been 446 {{patients}} (107 adults) operated for strabismus. This retrospective study (retrospection) indicated that out of those 107 adults 22 of them suffer from convergent concomitant strabismus, 29 from convergent paralytic strabismus, 42 from divergent concomitant strabismus and 14 from divergent paralytic strabismus. Three cases of strabismus surgery on adult patients are presented. Strabismus is a pathological deviation of one eye turning outwards, inwards, upwards or downwards that has severe consequences for sight and aesthetic appearance of a patient. Methods. Therapy consisted of ambulatory patient care, surgery and postoperative orthoptic-pleoptic training. In the first case of convergent paralytical strabismus with vertical component, the retroposition of internal rectus muscle, retroposition of inferior rectus muscle and resection of upper rectus muscle were performed. In the second case of divergent strabismus, resection of both internal rectus muscle and retroposition of <b>external</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> on left eye were performed by means of one surgery. In the third case of traumatic divergent paralytic strabismus, the late reconstruction and then resection of internal rectus muscle and retroposition of the <b>external</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> were performed. Results. Through operative treatment the objective squint angle was diminished and the aesthetic appearance was improved in all three cases. Conclusions. By means of strabismus surgery the aesthetic appearance of adult patients can be improved and by paralytic strabismus weak-sight (amblyopia), contraction of the eye muscles, ocular torticolis and psychic trauma can be prevented. In order to achieve a permanent result with surgical operation, the continuated postoperative orthoptic-pleoptic training is necessary. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine to what extent retinal image smearing during saccades provides information about the eye movement magnitude to the perceptual system. The technique involved obtaining measures of perceived movement when the total visual field was displaced in conjunction with saccadic eye movements. Trials with normal retinal smear were compared with trials on which smearing was greatly reduced or eliminated. The results are interpreted as showing {{that the absence of}} normal retinal smear during a saccade increases the uncertainty in the information available to the perceptual system and that this uncertainty results in a tendency to perceive smaller than veridical amounts of movement. Questions concerning the source of extraretinal information about eye position available to the perceptual system, and questions concerning the accuracy of such information, have been with us at least since Helmholtz (1867 / 1962). Accurate information about eye position might possibly be provided by input to the perceptual system from the muscle spindles or tendon organs of the extraocular muscles. Two major kinds of observation, however, persuaded Helmholtz that this was not the case. He pointed out that if a person with a paralyzed <b>external</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> of the right eye tries to move that eye to the right (left eye occluded), he sees the visual world jump to the right. In short, he perceives as if his eye did move to the right, and since the retinal image did not change, the world must have moved. If adequate "inflow" information were available to the perceptual system from the muscles that move th...|$|E

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{characteristics}} of excyclotropia correction through surgery on the inferior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> in patients with thyroid eye disease. This was a retrospective, observational study at a single institution. We reviewed 36 patients who had undergone unilateral inferior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> recession, with or without nasal inferior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> transposition. The following factors were investigated as possibly influencing excyclotropia correction: inferior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> thickness, degree of adipose change in the inferior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> smoking status, history of orbital radiotherapy, {{and the amount of}} inferior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> recession. Using T 1 -weighted coronal magnetic resonance imaging, we measured the cross-sectional area of the inferior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> at its largest point, as well as the bright-signal area of the inferior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> which reflects intermuscular adipose change. We then calculated the percentage internal bright-signal area at the point of the largest inferior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> cross-sectional area. The history of orbital radiotherapy was graded using a binary system. We evaluated correlations among excyclotropia correction, the amount of nasal inferior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> transposition, and the possible influencing factors listed, using stepwise multiple regression analyses. The multiple regression model demonstrated a significant relationship among excyclotropia correction, amount of nasal inferior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> transposition, and the amount of inferior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> recession (YCORRECTION = 8. 546 XTENDON WIDTH + 0. 405 XRECESSION- 0. 908; r = 0. 844; adjusted r 2 = 0. 695; P < 0. 001). Excyclotropia correction was correlated with the amount of nasal inferior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> transposition and the amount of inferior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> recession, but not with the other factors.

40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} the surgical method {{and extent of}} reoperation in the concomitant strabismus patients with surgical under-correction and over-correction. METHODS: Ninety-six concomitant strabismus patients with surgical under-correction and over-correction were recruited in this study, which included 41 males and 55 females, aged 21. 90 ± 14. 70. All individuals underwent routine eye examinations for strabismus before the surgery. Among the cases with concomitant esotropia, there were over-correction in 23 cases, under-correction in 15 cases. Among the cases with concomitant exotropia, there were over-correction in 28 cases, under-correction in 30 cases. The method of reoperation were based on angle of deviation, the method of original operation and acute visual acuity of patients. RESULTS:In over-correction cases with concomitant esotropia,medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> of 9 cases were advanced, the corrective extent was(5. 51 ± 2. 63) △ /mm; 9 cases were performed advance of medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> and recession of lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> the corrective extent was(6. 25 ± 1. 59) △ /mm; 3 cases were performed resection of medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> and recession of lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> the corrective extent was(4. 26 ± 1. 04) △ /mm; only 2 cases were performed recession of lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> the corrective extent was(4. 21 ± 1. 91) △ /mm. In under-correction cases with concomitant esotropia, 6 cases were performed resection of lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> the corrective extent was(4. 03 ± 0. 98) △ /mm; 6 cases were performed resection of lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> and recession of medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> the corrective extent was(6. 86 ± 1. 32) △ /mm; 3 cases were performed recession of medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> the corrective extent was(4. 33 ± 0. 29) △ /mm. In over-correction cases with concomitant exotropia, 16 cases were performed advance of lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> the corrective extent was(5. 37 ± 1. 56) △ /mm; 6 cases were performed recession of medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> the corrective extent was(6. 29 ± 3. 68) △ /mm; 5 cases were performed advance of lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> and recession of medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> the corrective extent was(5. 46 ± 1. 78) △ /mm; 1 case were performed resection of lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> the corrective extent was 5. 00 △ /mm. In under-correction cases with concomitant exotropia, 12 cases were performed resection of medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> the corrective extent was(4. 47 ± 0. 54) △ /mm; 16 cases were performed recession of lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> and resection of medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> the corrective extent was(5. 11 ± 0. 75) △ /mm; 2 cases were performed recession of lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> the corrective extent was(2. 65 ± 0. 42) △ /mm. CONCLUSION:In reoperation of concomitant strabismus patients with over-correction, weakening or/and strengthening the horizontal muscle which were performed surgery before has a greater and more unstable surgical corrective extent.

40|$|PurposeTo {{evaluate}} {{the effect on}} ocular alignment of Y splitting the lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> and then reattaching the 2 ends near the medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> insertion in patients with complete oculomotor nerve palsy. MethodsAll eyes with oculomotor nerve palsy treated between May 2008 and February 2010 with Y splitting and transposition of the lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> to the medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> were prospectively studied. In this procedure, the lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> was split: the upper half was transposed to the superior border and the lower half to the inferior border of the medial rectus insertion. For the muscles that had {{lost the ability to}} stretch and strain due to fibrosis, a hang-back technique was used. In some patients, the medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> of the same eye was subsequently strengthened or the lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> of the fellow eye was recessed. Final deviation from 0 Δ to 10 Δ was considered a successful result. ResultsA total of 10 patients were included. Patients had a preoperative horizontal deviation > 45 Δ (range, 45 Δ- 90 Δ). Of the 10 patients, 5 attained stable results following surgery, and 5 with postoperative undercorrection between 20 Δ and 30 Δ required further surgeries. Postoperatively, 2 patients improved their sensorial status in a very limited range of gaze and 2 patients had symptomatic diplopia.

40|$|Certain {{strabismus}} operations {{require a}} thorough {{knowledge of the}} anatomy of <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> insertions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Transposition {{techniques}} {{alter the}} muscle paths thereby creating new directions of muscle force. Extraocular muscle transposition procedures {{have been used}} to treat abducens palsy, Duane's retraction syndrome, double-elevator palsy and other complex ocular motility abnormalities. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the surgical and functional results of <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> transposition in patients with different aetiologies of severe ocular motility deficits. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1992 and 2008 <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> transposition surgery has been performed on 31 patients. In this retrospective case series one patient with an abducens nerve palsy is presented as an example. In addition, six patients with motility disorders of different aetiologies who had transposition manoeuvers were evaluated. Preoperative, surgical and postoperative data are reported. RESULTS: <b>Rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> transposition has been performed because of severe functional loss of the lateral <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> the superior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> or the medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> as well as in myopic strabismus fixus. One of the patients had traumatic sixth nerve palsy. The underlying pathology in patients who had superior transposition of the horizontal <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> were double-elevator palsy, congenital oculomotor nerve palsy and hypotropia caused by sphenoid wing hypoplasia. A nasal transposition of the vertical <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> was performed in traumatic and tumour-associated muscle loss of the medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle.</b> The large preoperative deviations were markedly reduced postoperatively and even ocular motility partially improved. CONCLUSIONS: Transposition surgery seems to be a suitable procedure for the treatment of complex ocular motility disorders. In cases of a complete lack of function of an extraocular muscle or in complex, uncommon conditions, which are difficult to treat with any other surgery, muscle transposition seems to be an effective procedure...|$|R

Observations: A 1 -year-old boy presented with esotropia. He had esotropia of 15 – 30 ° and intermittent left hypertropia. At the age of 3 years, the alternate prism cover test showed esotropia of 35 Δ and left hypertropia of 25 Δ.

DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative case series. METHODS: Multicenter study of 12 patients with apical orbital tumors removed using an endoscopic transethmoidal approach. The decision to detach the medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> with {{the addition of a}} transcaruncular approach was made during surgery for tumors largely lateral to the medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle.</b> Tumors adjacent to the medial orbital wall were removed via an endoscopic transethmoidal approach alone. RESULTS: Seven tumors were removed via an endoscopic transethmoidal approach combined with medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> detachment, whereas 5 patients underwent removal without detachment of the medial rectus. All patients had visual impairment. Complete excision of the hemangiomas was achieved in all patients and tumor size ranged from 6 × 5 mm to 20 × 12 mm. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 11. 8 ± 4. 3 months. At final follow-up, the best-corrected visual acuity improved in 11 patients. Three patients had transient horizontal diplopia resulting from partial paralysis of the medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> after detachment during surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The endoscopic transethmoidal approach with or without medial rectus detachment is a promising approach for selected small cavernous hemangiomas located at the deep medial orbital apex.
