Add Mother Nature to the equation and the challenge for some can be just too much! The impact of the physical symptoms faced by women who have reached leadership positions when the onset of menopause becomes a reality {{has been at the}} centre of recent Notre Dame PhD graduate, Dr Philippa Gavranich’s research. Dr Gavranich was awarded a doctorate from The University of Notre Dame Australia in July. Her thesis was titled: “Perceptions of women in leadership roles: Working through the change’. Over four years, Dr Gavranich has explored the perceived impact of perimenopausal symptoms on women in leadership roles: how they managed symptoms; the factors that influenced their decisions regarding treatment options and their recommendations for women in similar circumstances. “Participants reported that contending with the demands associated with a leadership role while experiencing these symptoms was often distracting and, for some a source of physical and emotional distress which had the capacity to undermine confidence and work performance,” <b>explains</b> <b>Dr</b> Gavranich. “Many reported feeling isolated because of the demands and status associated with their work. This isolation often restricted opportunities to gather and share information about symptoms with other women. ” Dr Gavranich says she hopes her research inspires women to become better informed about the nature and onset of perimenopausal symptoms. “It is important for them to be provided information about the most effective approaches to symptom management. ” Dean of the School of Health Sciences, Professor Helen Parker, said the results of Dr Gavranich’s research provided valuable insight into the experiences of a unique group of women. “Dr Gavranich’s findings have the potential to greatly assist health professionals who advise and support women in their management of perimenopausal symptoms,” Professor Parker said.

He remembers that it was Friday the 13 th {{when he and his}} wife, Mary, made the decision to drive from their home in Blackwood, New Jersey, to the Emergency Room at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. He says that {{by the time he had}} a CT scan, the stones seemed to have become lodged, reducing the intensity of his pain. But he and wife soon received shocking news: the scan showed that John had stage IV pancreatic cancer. That diagnosis started a journey at Jefferson that has lasted six years – and counting. His experience has included a Whipple procedure by Charles J. Yeo, MD, a series of eight chemoembolization treatments when the pancreatic cancer spread to his liver, an upper lobectomy performed by Nathaniel Evans, MD, when he was diagnosed with primary lung cancer and, most recently, 34 rounds of chemotherapy to combat a recurrence of pancreatic cancer. Despite the many challenges he has faced, John remains upbeat, optimistic and very grateful for the care he continues to receive at Jefferson. In fact, in June of this year, he sent a handwritten letter and generous gift to the Department of Surgery to recognize the individuals who have helped him along the way. The gift was split between the Pancreatic Research Fund and Thoracic Surgery Research 2 ̆ 6 Education Fund. “The Kesslers’ gift is supporting clinical research in lung and esophageal cancer,” <b>explains</b> <b>Dr.</b> Evans, Director of the Minimally Invasive Thoracic Surgery Program. “Ongoing research in our program is exploring the impact of minimally invasive techniques on patient outcomes and identifying risk factors for recurrence in early stage patients.

The aim of the grant is to support the recipients in their early post-doctoral career. Dr Hill is a Senior Lecturer in the School of Physiotherapy at The University of Notre Dame Australia (UNDA). Her recently completed PhD project, completed through The University of Queensland, was entitled: Falls prevention education for older patients designed using the Health Belief Model. She also holds the degree of Master of Physiotherapy from Curtin University of Technology and a Graduate Certificate in University Teaching from UNDA. Dean of the School of Physiotherapy, Professor Peter Hamer, says that Dr Hill’s ongoing success is recognition for her excellence in research. “Anne-Marie {{is one of only}} ten titled Gerontological Physiotherapists in Australia.

40|$|When the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) {{mandated}} residents’ {{involvement in}} quality improvement initiatives, Jefferson’s residents elected {{to do more}} than participate. They established Quality Based Improvement Resident Teams (QBIRT) and began taking a leadership role in improving the quality and safety of surgical care at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. “Each team decides which quality measure they’d like to better understand and then work to improve,” explains Associate Professor Scott W. Cowan, MD, FACS. “Some of the areas they’ve chosen to tackle include surgical site infections, urinary tract infections and central lineassociated bloodstream infections. ” Some of the teams’ projects align with the American College of Surgeons’ National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP®), giving them access to more data and opportunities for analysis. One example is the team led by PGY 3 resident Adam Johnson, MD, MPH, which is focusing on the high rate of post-surgical re-intubation and ventilator dependence – that is, reinsertion of a breathing tube and use of a machine to get air into and out of a patient’s lungs. “As residents, we’re {{on the front lines of}} healthcare delivery and can play an important role in identifying issues and helping design and implement solutions to systematically improve care,” says Dr. Johnson. “Postoperative pulmonary complications are luckily very rare but place a heavy burden on our patients and health system. They’ve been linked to high rates of patient mortality and rising healthcare costs. ” Johnson – Jefferson’s first Department of Surgery Quality and Safety Fellow as of July 1 – adds that the pathophysiology behind these events is complex and requires coordination among surgeons, anesthesiologists, pulmonologists, nurses and respiratory therapists. His team has analyzed NSQIP data and created a “risk score” to help stratify patients in terms of their risk for one of these two complications. “The aim is to proactively identify high-risk patients so we can potentially optimize their respiratory status before surgery,” <b>explains</b> <b>Dr.</b> Cowan, who serves as Jefferson’s NSQIP Surgeon Champion. “With a higher awareness of risk, we may be able to prevent re-intubation and respiratory complications by initiating intra- and postoperative pulmonary interventions in these high-risk patients. ” Another team, led by PGY 2 resident Brock Hewitt, MD, MPH, is focused on surgical site infections among colorectal surgery patients. “Our group identified an area where we felt we could have a significant impact on patient outcomes,” says Dr. Hewitt. “Using evidence-based interventions, we developed a surgical bundle aimed at decreasing surgical site infections from colon and rectal surgery. Over a six-month period we were able to decrease surgical site infections by nearly 60 percent. ” The bundle includes preoperative oral antibiotics, changing gowns and gloves before closure and utilizing a surgical closing tray. “To our knowledge, this is a unique bundle created by this team of Jefferson residents,” Dr. Cowan says, adding that the Department will soon expand NSQIP to Methodist Hospital, including implementing the surgical bundle for colorectal patients. “As a department, we’re focused on improving both quality and safety for our patients. ” Dr. Cowan says. “In the past, there was a ‘top-down’ approach to quality, with attending surgeons in charge. Now, our residents are very engaged, working directly with our attendings. We’re seeing great results. ...|$|E

40|$|A generous {{contribution}} via the Gail V. Coleman-Kenneth M. Bruntel Charitable Grant Fund (see “Those Who Give” on p. 4) {{has enabled}} Jordan M. Winter, MD, FACS, Associate Professor of Surgery, {{and his team}} to initiate two innovative studies in pancreatic cancer. Here, Dr. Winter {{provides an overview of}} the purpose – and potential impact – of each project. Studying Cancer Cell Metabolism As Dr. Winter explains, metabolism is a fundamental biologic process for the viability of any cell – including cancer cells. “If you {{can find a way to}} impair that biology, you have an opportunity to treat cancer by killing those cells,” he says. The challenge: Metabolism in cancer cells isn’t the same as in healthy cells. In pancreatic cancer cells, a protein called HuR appears to be an important regulator of metabolism – pancreatic cancer’s “secret weapon” in withstanding austere conditions. “Even with very low levels of oxygen and other nutrients, such as glucose and glutamine, pancreatic cancer cells not only survive but thrive,” Dr. Winter says. Prior work by Dr. Winter and Director of the Division of Surgical Research, Jonathan R. Brody, PhD, has focused on the role of HuR as a pro- survival protein. In other words, remove HuR and pancreatic cancer cells die. Thanks to the Coleman-Bruntel contribution, Dr. Winter and his laboratory team will be conducting a sophisticated metabolic experiment to better understand the “how” and “why” of HuR. They will do so by mapping the flow of carbon through metabolic pathways in cells with and without HuR. “Along with genetics and immunology, cancer cell metabolism is one of the hottest fields in cancer biology,” Dr. Winter notes. “This experiment is the first time anyone has examined how HuR affects metabolic pathways. It’s also the deepest exploration into how RNA biology plays a role in cancer cell metabolism. ” Understanding Chemotherapy Resistance The Coleman-Bruntel gift has also enabled Dr. Winter and his team to take on a second, more translational study – in other words, work that will be more directly applicable in patient care. This one aims to enhance understanding of the mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance in pancreatic cancer. “We’re studying patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who receive the most common treatment for stage 4 cancer, which is FOLFIRINOX” <b>explains</b> <b>Dr.</b> Winter. “About half of these patients have some benefit, with the tumor remaining stable or shrinking. Eventually, though, the biology of every tumor adjusts to develop resistance. ” The team wants to understand how the tumor adapts at the genetic level. For five to 10 patients, the team will first take a blood sample to obtain germline DNA to sequence (a laboratory process used to find mutations that may cause disease). Any mutations inherited from the germ cells (egg cell and sperm cell) of the patient’s parents will be found in this germline sequence. This will give the researchers a baseline for comparison. Second, the team will take a tumor biopsy prior to starting chemotherapy. They will grow the cell line in the lab, extract DNA and sequence the genome of the cancer before treatment. Finally, they will take a second biopsy during treatment once the tumor stops responding to chemotherapy and begins progressing. In other words, they will re-sample the tumor only after the biology of the cancer has changed – likely as a function of new mutations. “Analysis of the pre-treatment and post-progression biopsies will provide us with clues as to how the cancer evolves to gain resistance to the chemotherapy,” Dr. Winter explains. “A better understanding of which genes or pathways change may help in better targeting those pathways and, ultimately, in improving chemotherapy. ” Dr. Winter is quick to note that this is the first pilot of its kind and was made possible solely through the Coleman-Bruntel gift. It’s already serving as a springboard for further funding – and will likely be the first in a series of studies into chemotherapy resistance...|$|E
40|$|John Harbold is a busy guy. In 2013, he was 58 {{years old}} and {{teaching}} physical education, algebra and personal finance at a private Christian school near his hometown of Woodbury, NJ. He was also coaching the football team at Clearview Regional High School and working as a chaplain for the New Jersey Department of Corrections. By late summer, he started feeling very tired but chalked it up to “being an old guy running around with the young guys – nothing to worry about. ” Around that time, Harbold says, he started having bouts of hiccups lasting 10 to 15 minutes every time he ate. It was a nuisance but didn’t seem like an emergency. Then, in September, he awoke in the night sneezing and coughing. When he found a blood clot in his tissue, he {{got in touch with}} his family doctor. A blood test revealed that he was anemic, while other symptoms pointed to the need for a visit to his gastroenterologist, Howard Kroop, MD, at Jefferson. According to Harbold, the day after that visit is one he will never forget: “I was lying in my bed reading a book when my family doctor called and said, ‘John, you have cancer,’” he recalls. More specifically, he says, “It was adenocarcinoma of the esophageal-gastric junction – where the esophagus meets the stomach about 12 inches down from my Adam’s apple. ” Within days, Harbold was being seen by other physicians at the Jefferson Gastroesophageal Center, where the multi-disciplinary team was prepared to map out his treatment plan. He quickly underwent additional testing, which confirmed that his cancer was in an advanced stage. In a single day, he met with surgeon Ernest L. Rosato, MD, FACS, as well as radiation oncologist, Pramila Rani Anne, MD, and medical oncologist, Christina Brus, MD. He enrolled in a clinical trial and, in November 2013, started the first round of chemotherapy. At the end of those six weeks, a scan showed that the chemo had shrunk the tumor, and Harbold began a second, even more intense, round of chemotherapy plus radiation therapy. He recalls the extreme fatigue and numerous side effects but lauds Jefferson’s team. (“Every time I had a symptom, they had an answer,” he says.) Allowing six to eight weeks to recover from the second round of chemo and radiation therapy, Harbold was scheduled for an esophagectomy in April 2014 with Dr. Rosato and Nathaniel R. Evans, MD, FACS, FCCP. “An esophagectomy is a major procedure,” <b>explains</b> <b>Dr.</b> Rosato. “Dr. Evans and I were able to perform a minimally invasive esophagectomy to remove the tumor with a segment of esophagus and stomach as well as surrounding lymph nodes. This was all performed thoracoscopically and laparoscopically – by inserting scopes and instruments through small incisions into the chest and abdomen — without the need for any significant incisions. ” “The collaboration between general and thoracic surgeons allows us to tailor surgical therapy to the specific needs of each patient,” Dr. Evans notes. “The vast majority of our patients have minimally invasive surgery like Mr. Harbold. Smaller incisions mean less pain, so patients can get out of bed and get on the road to recovery sooner. ” Harbold spent almost two weeks recovering in the hospital before returning home to continue the process. “After surgery is a pretty difficult time,” he recalls. “Your body has to learn how to eat all over again, and just walking a few yards is a major event. ” He relied on Dr. Rosato and nurse practitioner Lori Pellegrino, MSN, CRNP, for answers to the many challenges he encountered along the way (see “On the Job” above). He also leaned heavily on his faith and his family, including his children and his ex-wife, all of whom have helped in providing his care. “The physical part is 50 percent – take the medication, take care of yourself, don’t push yourself,” he says. “But I think the biggest advice I would give to another patient is to prepare yourself emotionally and spiritually. Your faith either gets deeper or you find faith pretty quickly. You’re facing a very long recovery. ” These days, Harbold continues to be monitored by his team at Jefferson, but he is back to teaching and coaching, he’s exercising several times a week, and he’s even volunteering at the Jefferson Infusion Center – doing his best to give others hope and encouragement. He’s also active in a number of in-person and telephone-based support groups, including the one recently launched by the Gastroesophageal Center. “I can’t fight this thing alone, and the people who have helped me are just marvelous,” he says. “I thank God every day for the people at Jefferson!...|$|E
5000|$|The genomic {{information}} {{gives us}} {{a better understanding of}} what genes are important for different processes in the parasite's life cycle. So, it will now be possible to target these genes more specifically and interrupt its life cycle.

Scott, Ph.D., of the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University. [...] "Parasitic worms are a lot like foreign tissue that has been transplanted into the human body.
