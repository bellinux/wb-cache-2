An extension has been proposed for the Furuset Line to Lørenskog, which would give stations at Visperud, Lørenskog Centre and a new terminus at Akershus University Hospital (Ahus). The travel time from Ahus to Jernbanetorget would be 27 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{has participated}} in {{biathlon}} at every Olympics since 1984 except for 2002; Kerryn Rim's eighth place in 1994 in the 15km individual event was their best result. Cameron Morton represented Australia in 2006 and finished in the bottom 10% {{in each of his}} two races. In 2010, Australia's sole representative Alexei Almoukov came second last in his event—one competitor did not finish. Rim's result remains the only top-20 <b>finish</b> <b>by</b> an Australian in the discipline, and more than 80% of Australian entrants have finished in {{the bottom half of the}} field, including many in the bottom fifth.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Amuro and the {{children}} start marching and playing their instruments through downtown Los Angeles.

5|$|The casting {{equipment}} and the metal dies represent large capital costs and this tends to limit the process to high-volume production. Manufacture of parts using die casting is relatively simple, involving only four main steps, which keeps the incremental cost per item low. It is especially suited for a large quantity of small- to medium-sized castings, which is why die casting produces more castings than any other casting process. Die castings are characterized by a very good surface <b>finish</b> (<b>by</b> casting standards) and dimensional consistency.|$|E

5|$|In 2002–03, off-ice {{problems}} {{dominated the}} headlines. The Senators {{filed for bankruptcy}} on January 9, 2003, after {{a long history of}} debt. They continued regular season play after getting some emergency financing from the NHL. Despite the off-ice problems, Ottawa won the Presidents' Trophy, finishing with a franchise-record 113 points, making them the first Canadian team to win it since the Calgary Flames in 1989. This was also the highest <b>finish</b> <b>by</b> an Ottawa team in 77 years (since the original Senators finished first overall in 1926). In the 2003 playoffs, they defeated Yashin and his New York Islanders and the Philadelphia Flyers before coming within one game of making it into the Finals, falling to the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the New Jersey Devils.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{the turnpike}} {{commission}} {{announced plans to}} widen the Northeast Extension to six lanes between Mid-County and Lansdale. The project divided this stretch of highway into two sections. Work on the southern section began in January 2008 with the replacement of two bridges over the Northeast Extension to accommodate the widened highway. Construction on the actual widening phase commenced in January 2011. Completion was originally planned in 2013; however, construction fell a year behind schedule. The southern section finished up in October 2014, while work on the northern section started in May 2014. By this point the project scope was expanded to include the Lansdale interchange itself, the roadway to a point one mile north of the interchange, and two new E-ZPass-only ramps at the Lansdale interchange to relieve congestion at the toll plaza. This new northbound exit ramp opened December 4, 2016, and the companion southbound on-ramp opened a week later.. The northern section was originally planned to <b>finish</b> <b>by</b> the end of 2016 but was delayed until mid-2017. Construction is to be substantially complete, with all six lanes open, by August 31, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for {{electrification}} of the Meråker Line {{have been}} made since the 1940s. By then the Swedish side had been electrified. This was initially desired also by NSB {{in an effort to}} cut the high operating costs of steam trains. However, lines with higher traffic received priority. By 1971 the last steam trains were retired and issue of electrification for marginal lines were shelved. The issue was pressed by regional bodies from 1978 and 1992, and then again from the 2000s. This time the issue was successful and in 2013 the Parliament of Norway approved the electrification of the Meråker Line and the section from Trondheim to Steinkjer. The plan is to start the physical construction in 2017 and <b>finish</b> <b>by</b> 2022.|$|E

5|$|The Penguins {{clinched}} {{their second}} consecutive playoff berth on March 25 in a 2–0 {{victory against the}} New Jersey Devils and earned the second-seed in the Eastern Conference. Two years removed from their last-place Eastern Conference finish in 2006, the Penguins clinched the Atlantic Division {{for the first time}} ever, when they defeated the Philadelphia Flyers, 4–2. The division championship was the first for the Penguins since winning the Northeast Division in 1998. It was the best <b>finish</b> <b>by</b> the team since finishing second in the 1997–98 season. The 102 points the Penguins gained during the season was the team's fifth 100-point season. The Penguins raised banners for their top finish in the Atlantic Division and subsequent Eastern Conference playoff championship prior to the first Mellon Arena home game of the 2008–09 season.|$|E
5|$|When Westley {{took over}} the Hertfordshire club, Stevenage were sitting 21st in the Football Conference, and were six points adrift of safety. Unlike his {{position}} at his previous club, Westley was appointed as first-team manager, with no board involvement. He set about ensuring the club {{were still in the}} highest tier in non-league football, signing seven players from his previous club Farnborough, as well as his former assistant Graham Pearce and goalkeeping coach Graham Benstead. His first game in charge of the club was a 1–1 draw at home to Morecambe, before having to wait three games for his first win at the club – a 2–0 victory away at local rivals Barnet, thanks to a Dino Maamria brace. The victory sparked an eight-game unbeaten run, recording six victories on the bounce to ensure the club were safe from relegation. Westley had guided the club from 21st in the table to a respectable 12th-place <b>finish</b> <b>by</b> the end of the season. The 2003–04 season witnessed a much more consistent season under Westley's management, but the club were unable to make the play-offs and finished the campaign in 8th place, despite a positive start to the season.|$|E
