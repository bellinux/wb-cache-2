5|$|Cassandra {{demands to}} be killed by Mulder but, before he can do anything, the group is quarantined by Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers). Mulder, Cassandra, and Scully are taken to a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) {{facility}} at Fort Marlene, where Fowley tells the agents Cassandra is carrying a contagious organism. Meanwhile, Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) reports on Cassandra's <b>escape</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Syndicate, noting that the alien rebels want Cassandra kept alive. However, the Syndicate decides to turn Cassandra over to the colonists and save themselves by commencing colonization.|$|E

5|$|Judah Philip Benjamin, QC (August 11, 1811 – May 6, 1884) was {{a lawyer}} and {{politician}} who was a United States Senator from Louisiana, a Cabinet officer of the Confederate States and, after his <b>escape</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom {{at the end of}} the American Civil War, an English barrister. Benjamin was the first Jew to be elected to the United States Senate who did not renounce the religion, and the first of that faith to hold a Cabinet position in North America.|$|E
5|$|King Andrew died on 21 September 1235. Béla, {{who succeeded}} his father without opposition, was crowned king in Székesfehérvár on 14 October. He {{dismissed}} and punished {{many of his}} father's closest advisors. For instance, he had Palatine Denis blinded and Julius Kán imprisoned. The former was accused of having, in King Andrew's life, an adulterous liaison with Queen Beatrix, the King's young widow. Béla ordered her imprisonment, but she managed to <b>escape</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Empire, where {{she gave birth to}} a posthumous son, Stephen. Béla and his brother Coloman considered her son a bastard.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{considered}} attacking Camp Morton, the prisoner-of-war camp in Indianapolis, to free {{more than}} 5,000 Confederate {{prisoners of war}} imprisoned there, but decided against it. Instead, his raiders turned abruptly east and began moving towards Ohio. With Indiana's militia in pursuit, Morgan's men continued to raid and pillage their way toward the Indiana-Ohio border, crossing into Ohio on July 13. By the time Morgan left Indiana, his raid had become {{a desperate attempt to}} <b>escape</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> South. He was captured on July 26 in Ohio.|$|E

5|$|Set in 1920, {{the film}} follows the {{experiences}} of Tom Birkin (Colin Firth), who has been employed under a bequest to carry out restoration work on a Medieval mural discovered in a church in the small rural community of Oxgodby, Yorkshire. The <b>escape</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idyllic countryside is cathartic for Birkin, haunted by his experiences in World War I. Birkin soon fits into the slow-paced life of the remote village, and {{over the course of}} a summer uncovering a painting begins to lose his trauma-induced stammer and tics.|$|E
5|$|TCDD may in some {{conditions}} potentiate the carcinogenic {{effects of}} other compounds. An example is benzo(a)pyrene that is metabolized in two steps, oxidation and conjugation. Oxidation produces epoxide carcinogens that are rapidly detoxified by conjugation, but some molecules may <b>escape</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{nucleus of the}} cell and bind to DNA causing a mutation, resulting in cancer initiation. When TCDD increases the activity of oxidative enzymes more than conjugation enzymes, the epoxide intermediates may increase, increasing the possibility of cancer initiation. Thus a beneficial activation of detoxifying enzymes may lead to deleterious side effects.|$|E
5|$|The Grenztruppen {{were closely}} watched {{to ensure that}} they could not take {{advantage}} of their inside knowledge to escape across the border. Patrols, watchtowers and observation posts were always manned by two or three guards at a time. They were not allowed to go out of each other's sight in any circumstances. If a guard attempted to escape, his colleagues were under instructions to shoot him without hesitation or prior warning; 2,500 did <b>escape</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West, 5,500 more were caught and imprisoned for up to five years, and a number were shot and killed or injured in the attempt.|$|E
25|$|By War's end, the Ustaše {{had murdered}} more than 500,000 Serbs, {{approximately}} 40,000 Roma (Gypsies) and 32,000 Jews. Among Bosnian Jews, 10,000 of the pre-War Jewish population of 14,000 had been murdered. Most of the 4,000 who had survived {{did so by}} fighting with the Yugoslav, Jewish or Soviet Partisans or by <b>escaping</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Italian controlled zone (approximately 1,600 had <b>escaped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Italian controlled zone on the Dalmatian coast).|$|R

5|$|The {{recruitment}} of Rookwood, Tresham and Digby {{coincided with a}} series of meetings in various taverns across London, during which the last remaining details were worked out. Fawkes would light the fuse, and escape by boat across the Thames. An uprising would start in the Midlands, during which Princess Elizabeth was to be captured. Fawkes would <b>escape</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> continent and explain to the Catholic powers what had happened in England.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{controversy}} concerning the widely reported imbalance of the game, as the rules strongly favor the king, {{although there are}} several rule modifications that can produce more balanced play, such as a weaponless king (the king cannot participate in captures), <b>escape</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corners (rather than to the edges), or hostile attacker camps (the king and defenders may be captured against a vacant attacker camp square). Schmittberger (1992) even reveals some workarounds to produce more balanced play without modifying the rules of gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Using global geometry, some spacetimes can {{be shown}} to contain {{boundaries}} called horizons, which demarcate one region {{from the rest of}} spacetime. The best-known examples are black holes: if mass is compressed into a sufficiently compact region of space (as specified in the hoop conjecture, the relevant length scale is the Schwarzschild radius), no light from inside can <b>escape</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outside. Since no object can overtake a light pulse, all interior matter is imprisoned as well. Passage from the exterior to the interior is still possible, showing that the boundary, the black hole's horizon, is not a physical barrier.|$|E

50|$|Following the cataclysm {{that ended}} the Thurian age, these islands sank into the sea. <b>The</b> {{surviving}} Lemurians <b>escaped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east coast of the Thurian continent but were enslaved by an unnamed pre-human race. After enduring {{more than a thousand}} years of brutal slavery, the Lemurians were reduced to a state of savagery. They eventually rose up and destroyed their masters, the survivors of whom <b>escaped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of Thuria <b>to</b> form <b>the</b> nation of Stygia.|$|R
5|$|After {{the fall}} of his stronghold in Kediri, Trunajaya managed to <b>escape</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{mountains}} of eastern Java. VOC and the king's forces chased Trunajaya, who, isolated and deprived of food, surrendered to the VOC {{at the end of}} 1679. Initially, he was treated with respect as a captive of the VOC commander. However, during a ceremonial visit to the royal residence in Payak, East Java, on 2 January 1680, he was personally stabbed by Amangkurat, and the king's courtiers finished him off. The king defended this killing of a VOC prisoner by saying that Trunajaya had tried to kill him. The VOC was not convinced by this explanation, but it chose not to call the king into account. A romanticised account of Trunajaya's death appears in the 18th-century Central Javanese babads.|$|E
5|$|At 19:00, the German ships {{closed to}} attack. In {{the span of}} five minutes, the German cruisers' guns had seriously damaged Good Hope, which was {{destroyed}} by a magazine explosion. Monmouth attempted to <b>escape</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south; she was burning furiously and her guns had fallen silent. Nürnberg closed to point-blank range of Monmouth and poured shells into her. Glasgow was forced to abandon Monmouth after 20:20, before fleeing south and meeting with Canopus. Monmouth eventually capsized and sank at 21:18. Over 1,600men {{were killed in the}} sinking of the two armored cruisers, including Admiral Craddock; German losses were negligible. However, the German ships had expended over 40% of their ammunition supply.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00 on 16 December 1941, Corregidor {{left its}} dock in Manila in total darkness, loaded to {{overcapacity}} with Filipino civilians seeking to <b>escape</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southern Philippines {{after the war}} had started. It {{has been estimated that}} between 1,200 and 1,500 people were on board, including approximately 150 Philippine soldiers, 7 Americans, 5 Philippine legislators, and hundreds of college students who were traveling home after their schools had closed. Also aboard were military supplies as well the entire artillery complement of the Visayan-Mindanao Force of the Philippine Army. The owners of the ship failed to inform the Navy's Inshore Patrol of the ship's plan to leave Manila Bay.|$|E

5|$|Between 24 April and 1 May, the IX Army {{fought a}} desperate action {{to break out}} of the pocket in an attempt to link up with the XII Army. Hitler assumed that after a {{successful}} breakout from the pocket, the IX Army could combine forces with the XII Army and would be able to relieve Berlin. There is no evidence to suggest that Generals Heinrici, Busse, or Wenck thought that this was even remotely strategically feasible, but Hitler's agreement to allow the IX Army to break through Soviet lines allowed many German soldiers to <b>escape</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west and surrender to the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|Bond learns Blofeld {{has been}} curing {{a group of}} young British and Irish women of their {{livestock}} and food allergies. In truth, Blofeld and his aide, Irma Bunt, have been brainwashing them into carrying biological warfare agents back to Britain and Ireland in order to destroy the agricultural economy, upon which post-World War II Britain depends. Believing himself discovered, Bond escapes by ski from Piz Gloria, chased by SPECTRE operatives, a number of whom he kills in the process. Afterward, in a state of total exhaustion, he encounters Tracy. She is in the town {{at the base of the}} mountain after being told by her father that Bond may be in the vicinity. Bond is too weak to take on Blofeld's henchmen alone and she helps him <b>escape</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> airport. Smitten by the resourceful, headstrong woman, he proposes marriage and she accepts. Bond then returns to England and works on the plan to capture Blofeld.|$|E
5|$|Despite being neutral at {{the start}} of World War II, Belgium and its colonial {{possessions}} found themselves at war after the country was invaded by German forces on 10 May 1940. After 18 days of fighting in which Belgian forces were pushed back into a small pocket in the north-east of the country, the Belgian military surrendered to the Germans, beginning an occupation that would endure until 1944. The surrender of 28 May was ordered by King Leopold III without the consultation of his government and sparked a political crisis after the war. Despite the capitulation, many Belgians managed to <b>escape</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom where they formed a government and army-in-exile on the Allied side.|$|E
