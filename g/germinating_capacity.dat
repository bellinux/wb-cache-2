40|$|The goal of {{the study}} {{conducted}} in 2008 and 2010 at the Research Forage Production Station in Vatín {{was to investigate the}} influence of seed age and seed treatment by Proradix method on the germination dynamics, total <b>germinating</b> <b>capacity</b> and initial growth rate of selected meadow grass varieties. The testing was carried out in controlled conditions on the germinator. Our results indicate that the age of seed significantly affects both the germination dynamics and the total <b>germinating</b> <b>capacity.</b> On day 7 after the establishment of the trial, a significantly higher <b>germinating</b> <b>capacity</b> was observed in the 4 -year old seed (33. 3 %) as compared with the 2 -year old seed (17. 4 %). Nevertheless, from day 13, higher germination values were recorded in the younger seed and its total achieved <b>germinating</b> <b>capacity</b> was significantly higher too (+ 7. 2 %). Interesting was a finding that the older seed of most varieties showed a more readily oncoming germination, which may play a quite important role in some cases namely in meadow grass, which is known by slow initial growth. The older seed exhibited significantly lower values of both above-ground biomass and the biomass of roots. The Proradix method appeared as efficient in boosting the total <b>germinating</b> <b>capacity.</b> It significantly increased germination rate as well as total <b>germinating</b> <b>capacity.</b> At the same time, a positive effect was observed of treatment by this method on the length of both shoot and root parts; the difference was statistically insignificant though...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the iSeed method {{treatment}} on germination dynamics, total <b>germinating</b> <b>capacity</b> {{and the length of}} above-ground and root parts was studied in laboratory conditions for the Red fescue varieties Darwin and Moccasin, Kentucky bluegrass varieties Yvette and Miracle, Perennial ryegrass varieties Beatrice and Milan, and White clover varieties Pirouette and Pipolina. In the Perennial ryegrass, the iSeed treatment adversely affected the energy of germination in the first days of study. The <b>germinating</b> <b>capacity</b> gradually equalized during the experiment. Red fescue and Kentucky bluegrass did not show any response to the treatment. Similarly as the Perennial ryegrass, the two varieties of White clover exhibited higher energy of germination on the third day from the establishment. A demonstrably positive {{effect of the}} iSeed treatment was recorded on the number of germinated individuals. Particularly the variety Pirouette showed significantly higher <b>germinating</b> <b>capacity</b> until the tenth day of monitoring the treated seeds. The iSeed method had no statistically significant influence on the values of total <b>germinating</b> <b>capacity</b> in all tested species and varieties. The effect of the iSeed method treatment on the length of shoot and root parts was not statistically demonstrated. Some varieties showed a positive effect and some showed a negative effect. A significant difference was observed only in the untreated variety Moccasin whose above-ground part was by 14 [*]mm longer as compared with the treated variant...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, sorghum malts {{used for}} the chakpalo {{production}} are dried under the sun in not controlled conditions in Benin. In order to improve drying operation in a rural approach, a shell drier was tested {{and the quality of}} the dried malts was evaluated. The <b>germinated</b> <b>capacity,</b> thousand kernel weight, moisture, protein and fat contents of the red sorghum used for malting were respectively 94 %, 27. 81 %, 11. 65 %, 11. 4 % and 3. 57 %. The quality of the dried malt in the shell drier and those of the dried malt directly under the sun was compared. The results showed that the speed of malt drying was higher in the shell drier than under the sun. Indeed, the moisture contents of the dried malts directly under the sun and in the shell drier after 12 hours were respectively 12. 56 % and 7. 66 %. The microbiological quality of the dried malts in the shell drier was better. There were free of faecal coliforms. The results of this study indicate that the controlled drying of sorghum malts by using a shell drier improved the drying speed and the microbiological characteristics of the dried malts.

40|$|Application. Timing of {{prescribed}} {{burning in the}} Southeastern U. S. can be critical when used to enhance seedbeds for natural regeneration of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.). Since the majority of loblolly pine seeds are disseminated before January during average seed years on Coastal Plain sites, prescribed winter burns conducted after that date are likely to destroy most pine seeds deposited in the upper litter layer of the forest floor. Abstract. Stratified loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) seeds were placed at three depths in a reconstructed forest floor and subjected to simulated prescribed winter burns. Within the forest floor, pine seeds were placed at the L/upper-F interface, upper-F/lower-F interface, and lower-F/mineral-soil interface. Wind was generated by electric box-fans. Seeds that survived the burns were transferred to moist sand flats for 30 -day germination tests. About 96 % of seeds placed at the two upper layers in the forest floor were either destroyed by the fires or failed to <b>germinate.</b> Germinative <b>capacity</b> of seeds placed at the lower-F/mineral-soil interface averaged 79 % as compared to 97 % for unburned control seeds.

40|$|Siberian fir seeds often {{lose their}} <b>germinating</b> <b>capacity</b> during storage. This results from, among other factors, {{changing}} contents of nitrogen compounds in the seeds, {{especially those of}} protein fractions. This paper focuses on analyzing changes of these compounds in nonviable seeds of the species depending on ecological and conditions and stand location, {{as well as on}} tree growth class (Kraft growth classes I and IV). The contents of the total and protein nitrogen in the nonviable seeds of the trees of growth classes I and IV appeared to vary widely and to depend on stand location and seed location in the tree crown. The maximum contents were in the seeds located in {{the upper part of the}} crown. The seeds from the middle and lower crown parts contained much less total and protein nitrogen. The hard-to-solve protein fraction dominated over other protein fraction in the seeds from the upper part of the crowns of the trees of growth classes I and IV. However, this fraction, like prolamines, changed uniformly throughout the crowns, whereas seed glutelin content varied insignificantly among the crown parts. Albumins and globulins showed a uniform crown top-to-bottom decrease. A comparison of viable seed with unviable seeds for contents of the nitrogen forms revealed a marked decrease in the total and protein nitrogen in the latter, especially for the trees of growth class IV. The seeds that lost their <b>germinating</b> <b>capacity</b> exhibited increasingly hard-to-solve protein fraction and drastically decreasing albumins and globulins wherever the seeds were in the crown. Their glutelin and prolamine contents changed inconsiderably.

A significant correlation was demonstrated between pH, and fluorine and calcium content in the bark. On the other hand, sulphur content was dependent on the amount of Na, K and Ca. For demonstrating contamination of the surface bark layer a test was applied consisting in evaluation of the <b>germinating</b> and development <b>capacity</b> of seeds.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{attempt was}} made to evaluate germination performances of three lentil cultivars namely Nineveh, Adlib and Baraka, besides Common Vetch and Mungbeans under varying soil water availabilities. Soils were moistened to 100, 75, 50 and 25 % of its water available capacity and were used as germinating media. Germinating seeds in 0 % soil AWC depletion was surpassed over that of 25, 50 and 75 % depletion of AWC in terms of final germination percentage (2. 8, 13. 3, 53. 2 %, respectively), radical length (16. 6, 48 and 129. 1 %, respectively), plumule length (27. 5, 34. 8 and 128 %, respectively). This treatment also revealed substantial reductions in days required for peak germination (36, 50. 8 and 63. 9, respectively) and days required for first emergence (5. 6, 50 and 75 %, respectively). Thus, treatments can be arranged according to their adversities as below: 75 %> 50 %> 25 %> 0 % depletion out of soil AWC. Mungbean cultivar exceeded Nineveh, Adlib, Baraka and Common Vetch in terms of germination rate (59, 53. 6, 40. 4 and 124. 1 %, respectively), Furthermore, it profoundly shortened the days required for peak germination (34. 6, 40. 4, 19. 2 and 51. 9 %, respectively), days for first emergence (110, 105, 100 and 140 %, respectively) and radical: plumule lengths ratio (33. 9, 9. 3, 21. 4 and 33. 9 %, respectively). Therefore, detected cultivars can be arranged as follow: Mungbean> Baraka> Adlib> Nineveh> Common Vetch. The most effective dual interaction was Mungbean seeds <b>germinated</b> under field <b>capacity.</b> It manifested the best values in terms of final germination rate (100 %), germination time (1 day), and germination rate (100), plumule length (93. 75 mm). It had reduced days required for peak germination (1), days for first emergence (1).

40|$|UNESCO-UNEVOC International Centre and the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) UNEVOC National Centre Ireland jointly {{organised}} an International Expert’s Consultation seminar from 18 to 20 August, 2008 at DIT Aungier Street Campus, in Dublin, Ireland. Since DIT {{joined the}} UNEVOC Network in early 2007, Mr. Aidan Kenny, co-ordinator of the National UNEVOC Centre Ireland and Dr. L. Efison Munjanganja, Head, UNEVOC Networks had in conversations and in correspondence been keen {{about the idea}} of a consultative seminar on technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and capacity building in the UNEVOC Network. Central to the idea was the stimulation of capacity building, networking and enabling collaborative and scholarship activities focused on international TVET issues. The emerging idea of an expert’s consultation began to focus on a design to stimulate networking and capacity building within the UNEVOC Network by raising the awareness of the needs, interests and strengths of various UNEVOC Centres in developed countries the North and in developing countries the South. Developing relationships between the North and South were identified by the partners as an area for strategic action. There was a perceived gap between the expert knowledge and resources in some UNEVOC Centres and the needs of other UNEVOC Centres. The partners wanted to explore the magnitude of this perceived gap and identify opportunities and possible solutions to reduce this gap. A crucial focus was the disparity in expertise and resources between the North and South. The partners want to bridge this gap by facilitating an network event that could create relationships between UNEVOC Centres in the North and South In tandem to this the partners also wanted to <b>germinate</b> a <b>Capacity</b> Building process, offering space and providing opportunities to share information on innovations in technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and on possible contributions of UNEVOC Centres to knowledge building and knowledge sharing. It was felt at the time that by developing a structured event we could make a positive contribution to the stimulating of networking relationships, the sharing of experience and the deepening of understanding between UNEVOC Centres in both the North and South. From the on-set the partners operated from the principles of respect for diversity, inclusiveness, transparency and ethical governance. As the project had limited resources available to fulfil its goals, it was decided to strategically list UNEVOC Centres from both the North and South who would be invited to the seminar. Our priority was to identify UNEVOC Centres that could contribute to the process and gain positive outcomes from participating in the event. Over twenty UNEVOC Centres participated in the seminar form various countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and the United States of America. The list of the participants {{can be found in the}} appendix 1. From the feedback received before, during and after the seminar it would seem that collectively the process of strengthening the Network, stimulating capacity building activities and developing North-South relationships is moving in the right direction. The partners are committed to continuing this process and look forward to working with new colleagues in the future. The purpose of this report is to share the learning and outcomes that arose during the planning and implementation phases of this project and to begin to chart the strategic direction of where this project can move towards. The report is divided into three interconnected sections. Section 1 provides some background information on the emergence of the idea from concept to practice. Section two details the presentations that were made by speakers at the seminar. Section three details the findings and actions that come out of the workshshops and plenary sessions, it also summarised some of the key recommendations.

40|$|We have {{developed}} an approach combining physiology and quantitative genetics to enhance our understanding of nitrogen (N) metabolism during kernel germination. The physiological study highlighted {{the central role of}} glutamine (Gln) synthetase (GS) and Gln synthesis during this developmental process because a concomitant increase of both the enzyme activity and the amino acid content was observed. This result suggests that Gln is acting either as a sink for ammonium released during both storage protein degradation and amino acid deamination or as a source for amino acid de novo synthesis by transamination. In the two parental lines used for the quantitative genetics approach, we found that the increase in Gln occurred earlier in Io compared with F 2, a result consistent with its faster <b>germinating</b> <b>capacity.</b> The genetic study was carried out on 140 F 6 recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross between F 2 and Io. Quantitative trait locus mapping identified three quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to germination trait (T 50, time at which 50 % of the kernels germinated) that explain 18. 2 % of the phenotypic variance; three QTLs related to a trait linked to germination performance, kernel size/weight (thousand kernels weight), that explain 17 % of the phenotypic variance; two QTLs related to GS activity at early stages of germination that explain 17. 7 % of the phenotypic variance; and one QTL related to GS activity at late stages of germination that explains 7. 3 % of the phenotypic variance. Coincidences of QTL for germination efficiency and its components with genes encoding cytosolic GS (GS 1) and the corresponding enzyme activity were detected, confirming the important role of the enzyme during the germination process. A triple colocalization on chromosome 4 between gln 3 (a structural gene encoding GS 1) and a QTL for GS activity and T 50 was found; whereas on chromosome 5, a QTL for GS activity and thousand kernels weight colocalized with gln 4, another structural gene encoding GS 1. This observation suggests that for each gene, the corresponding enzyme activity is of major importance for germination efficiency either through the size of the grain or through its faster <b>germinating</b> <b>capacity.</b> Consistent with the possible nonoverlapping function of the two GS 1 genes, we found that in the parental line Io, the expression of Gln 3 was transiently enhanced during the first hours of germination, whereas that of gln 4 was constitutive...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Throughout {{the course}} of {{development}} wheat seeds undergo changes in both fresh and dry weight and in moisture content. Between 10 and 20 DAF, both fresh and dry weights increase very rapidly. Accumulation of dry matter ceases {{at the same time}} as the seed dried out at 40 DAF. The natural desiccation period for wheat seeds is established between 30 and 40 DAF. Freshly harvested wheat seeds are capable of germinating during the period between 20 and 30 DAF but <b>germinating</b> <b>capacity</b> is very low. Increased frequency of germination along with the increase in seed age was observed in case of artificially desiccated seeds. It is noteworthy that the capacity of desiccated seeds to germinate does not depend on the degree of desiccation but only on their age at harvest time. The amount of water absorbed by desiccated seeds during germination depends on developmental stage of seeds at harvest time. It was established that to the lower initial moisture content of desiccated seeds correspond higher amounts of water absorbed in {{the course of}} germination. Moreover for every investigated phase of seed development there is a determined degree of moisture and the water uptake of desiccated seeds can not overcome this value. Full maturity of field grown wheat seeds was reached at 50 DAF...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the general morphological aspects of Trifolium montanum L. and T. pannonicum Jacq. pollen with the diagnosis {{value of the}} respective taxa. It also {{presents the}} variability of pollen <b>germinating</b> <b>capacity</b> in the two taxons from the Fabaceae family, according to the factor of glucidic concentration in the artificial germination environment. We have tested germination in nutritive mediums lacking glucidic elements and in mediums with different sucrose concentrations, until 350 %. This paper presents the concentration of glucidic elements from mediums allowing pollen germination at minimum percentage, shows the sucrose concentrations for developing the germination process under best conditions and analyses the germination process in dynamics (after 3, 24, 48 and 72 hours since pollen inoculation in nutritive mediums). The obtained results may be correlated to the amplitude of the variability in pollen grain size, to the ecological plasticity typical of the two taxons, plasticity controlled by the genetic substratum typical of the two tightly related species. It was shown that the pollen germinating potential was different, being a species trait, with diagnosis value. The Trifolium montanum pollen having a higher germinating potential, it could be correlated to the vast spreading area of this species, which is represented in europe, caucasia, siberia, persia, america. the germinating potential of the Trifolium pannonicum pollen (with spreading area {{in europe and in}} north of northern of america), lower than of the other taxon, could be explained by the high polyploidy degree...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Modern {{ecological}} {{state of}} the environment and human unhealthy diet cause many diseases. A healthy diet is the one that contains adequate amounts of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, macronutrients and micronutrients. Photosynthesis i. e. the process by which plants produce organic compounds from carbon dioxide and water, is the source of life, the source of evolution and proliferation of life forms on the Earth. Thus, the juice made from sprouted barley provides physiologically active chlorophyll, macronutrients and micronutrients, vitamins А, В 2, В 3, В 5, В 6, В 8, Е and К. It is well known that light from a red laser with a wavelength of 638. 2 nm has a stimulating action on the germination energy, germination ability and productivity of seeds, and on the crop yields. Therefore, this research is of primary importance today. The research result produced a sharp decline in plant vigor and <b>germinating</b> <b>capacity</b> of barley when soaking in 1 n sodium carbonate solution, as well as changes in the ratio of potassium-sodium balance in plants. Thus at lower concentrations of sodium carbonate and 0. 1 n sodium increasing of pigment content in barley is observed on the seventh day. The red laser light has a similar stimulating action: the chlorophyll content of barley plants increased after the red laser treatment of barley seeds. However, the chlorophyll contents were depressed when the seeds were exposed to far red light with wavelengths of 754 ± 10 nm. Using these factors, one can manage the content of chlorophyll and sodium-potassium balance in the initial stages of barley ontogenesis in the technology of barley juice or the powder for a healthy and proper human diet...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{effectiveness}} of a seedfly, Pegohylemyia jacobaeae (Diptera: Anthomyiidae) as a biological control agent of ragwort, Senecio jacobaea. Seedfly populations were sampled from October to April in 1982 / 83 and 1983 / 84 at two sites in the central North Island, New Zealand. Supplementary laboratory experiments were conducted to clarify aspects of the seedfly/ragwort interaction. In the field a six week pre-oviposition period was recorded before ragwort flowered. The absence of ragwort flowers had no effect on ovary development in laboratory reared flies but the pre-oviposition period predicted by a day degree summation model was shorter than that observed in the field. The extended pre-oviposition period resulted in competition for oviposition sites when ragwort first flowered, with consequent low fecundity and multiple oviposition. This competition was higher in the second year due to a tenfold increase in the number of flies emerging compared with the previous year. The total number of ragwort seedheads was similar in both years but inflorescence development was faster in 1983 / 84. A combination of increased seedfly population, increased competition for oviposition sites and improved synchrony between emergence and ragwort flowering in 1983 / 84 resulted in a twofold increase in infestation levels compared to 1982 / 83. Estimates of seedfly mortality within the seedhead were 33 % and 60 % in 1982 / 83 and 1983 / 84 respectively but were affected by the variable length of the third larval instar. Laboratory and field data indicated that pupating third instar larvae leave the seedhead in conditions of high surface moisture and prolonged dry conditions resulted in high mortality. Pupal mortality ranged from 14. 3 to 57 % but this was also affected by estimates of third instar larvae. Pupal diapause is initiated at temperatures above 15 - 20 C and in the central North Island seedfly rarely diapause in winter. Seedfly infestation levels ranged from 10 % (1982 / 83) to 20 % (1983 / 84) and up to 200 seedheads/m 2 escaped predation. Ragwort seeds are long-lived, have a high <b>germinating</b> <b>capacity,</b> and uneaten seeds from seedfly infested seedheads were viable. It was concluded that at the study sites the seedfly's impact on the ragwort population was negligible...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was focused on {{breaking}} the long dormancy of harvested and treated seed of the Cornelian cherry. We used stratification, which accelerates ripening, enables rapid termination of dormancy and removes all obstacles to germination. The seeds were obtained from three localities (Tišnov, Lednice, Žabčice). Prior to stratification the seeds were soaked in water for 24 hours and then three stages of treatment were applied; 1 st control stage – cold stratification, 2 nd warm-cold stage – five-phase stratification and 3 rd stage – treatment with auxinoids. In stages 1 and 2 after stratification the seeds were sown in spring; in the 3 rd stage seeds were sown once again in autumn. In the 1 st control stage the seeds did not germinate. In the 2 nd stage after warm-cold stratification 14. 13 % plants of the Tišnovský 1 ecotype emerged; while only 6. 33 % plants of the Tišnovský 3 ecotype. In the 3 rd stage, after auxinoid treatment and autumn sowing, 13. 26 % and 10. 13 % plants of Lednický 1 and Lednický 2, respectively, emerged. In the 1 st control stage 3. 86 % of the Jaltský variety and 2. 80 % of Elegantní emerged. In the 2 nd stage after treatment applying warm-cold stratification the varieties achieved various degrees of emergence; Botanický 5. 66 %, Elegantní 5. 40 % and Fruchtal 5. 26 %. The highest proportion of germinating plants {{was seen in the}} 3 rd stage in the Jaltský variety, i. e. 16. 74 %, while the emergence of the varieties Fruchtal and Vydubecký was lower, i. e. 14. 25 % and 12. 20 %, respectively. In the 2 nd year after a lapse of one year of dormancy the <b>germinating</b> <b>capacity</b> ranged between 62. 30 and 76. 28 %. Evaluations of the growth parameters of the seedlings were focused on the height of the plants and diameter of the root collar. The height of the seedlings ranged between 0. 31 and 0. 38  m and the diameter of the root collar between 4. 12 and 4. 40  mm. The weight of the stones of the ecotypes was considerably lower and ranged between 0. 19 and 0. 25  g. On the other hand the weight of seeds of the varieties was higher and ranged between 0. 36 and 0. 60  g. The difference was statistically highly significant.

40|$|Introduction The {{data from}} the {{literature}} concerning insect killing Deuteromycetes are discussed. Stress is laid on many fundamental problems and on gaps in the scientific observations. Nomenclature It appears from a bibliographic survey that Metarrhizium brunneum PETCH, Metarrhizium album PETCH and Metarrhizium anisopliae (METSCHNIKOFF) SOROKIN most probably represent a single species. The conidial lengths divide the fourteen isolated strains into two groups; these conform to the 'forma major' and the 'forma minor' of JOHNSTON (1915). Because of the supposed absence of original type material of M. anisopliae the author fixed a neotype and deposited it in the Centraal Bureau voor Schimmelcultures at Baarn (The Netherlands). Isolation, development and growth, storing Conidiospores of M. anisopliae, isolated from 14 species of insects, were cultivated on cherry-agar, on the medium according to MARTIN (1950) or on a special isolation medium (VEEN & FERRON, 1966). In the last medium, actidione (cycloheximide) and chloramphenicol is added {{in order to prevent}} infections by bacteria and fungi. The fungus sporulates excellently in surface cultures when the Chapoteaut peptone composition is used as nutrient medium. The mass production of conidiospores has been carried out on boiled sterile rice. The formation of blastospores has been tested in shake cultures according to the Adamek (1967) method; this has been done with five strains of forma major and five of forma minor. Generally a concentration of 10 8 - 10 9 blastopores per ml. is obtained after 96 hours; one strain, however, sporulated only poorly. The strains could be successfully stored at + 4 °C for at least 20 months after culturing on egg-yolk coagulated at 80 °C. Lyophilization of conidial suspensions in skimmed milk did not affect the <b>germinating</b> <b>capacity</b> of the spores for six months. List of host insects Scrutiny of the literature revealed that at least 204 species of insects are susceptible to M. anisopliae under natural conditions. These are mostly Coleoptera of which the terricolous species predominate. Germination and development of germtubes Conidiospores of M. anisopliae germinate only in contact with water. Intersegmental folds of the host Schistocerca gregaria FORSK. prevented direct observations, but germination of the conidiospores on exposed parts of the cuticle apparently are not affected by the transpiration of the insect. Epicuticular lipids of fifth stage larvae evoke conidial germination, in contrast to beeswax. The composition of the nutrient medium used for sporulation, may likewise exercise great influence on germination of spores when transferred to an extraction of epicuticular lipids of locusts; the various strains of M. anisopliae however behave differently. Both in vivo and in vitro the germinated fungus forms structures analogous to 'appressoria'. But in vitro only rarely penetration tubes originate beneath the 'appressoria'. Also the latter structures are not always essential to the development of penetration tubes. Penetration and infection Histological sections show that the infection of second instar locust larvae by conidia of a race of M. anisopliae isolated from S. gregaria takes place after about 90 hours. The site of penetration of the hyphae is the mouth cavity, mainly the proximal part of the maxillary palps. The ambient relative humidity has no influence on this process. Penetration of exposed integument, however, occurs only if a water film is present. Experiments on third instar larvae have shown that the fungus has no preference for specific areas of the integument (as for instance the inter-segmental membranes) for penetration. Any area of the integument can be penetrated. It has been observed that both chemical and mechanical activities play a part in the penetration process. Phagocytosis of the fungus by haemocytes was never observed. Infection also takes place when conidiospores are injected in the rectum, but obviously this is of no importance under normal conditions when infection through the mouth prevails. Probably, blastospores are formed in the places where the penetrating mycelium. comes into contact with circulating haemolymph. The last stage of the disease When the insect dies, the amount of fungus material in the body is often relatively insignificant. Shortly before death the insects often behave abnormally. These observations suggest an action of toxins. Therefore, the toxicity of culture filtrates of ten strains of M. anisopliae was assayed on caterpillars of Galleria mellonella L. and larvae of S. gregaria. Considerable differences in activity between the strains were found. However, we were unable to establish a correlation between the production of toxins of the different strains and the degree of virulence for S. gregaria. Sporulation When locust larvae are kept in very high relative humidity, bacterial infections with a variable mortality are not uncommon. These unfavorable conditions obviously change the physiological condition of the insects. The early stages of an infection by M. anisopliae are also characterized by a reduced vitality of the host. In many cases blastospores as well as bacteria are found {{side by side in the}} haemolymph, even before death. A competition between these microorganisms then occurs after death. Under these conditions the sporulation of the fungus is inhibited, though to a different degree in different strains. This is also confirmed by the observation that bacterial colonies mainly (Aeromonas sp.) may locally suppress the growth of the fungus on a Sabouraud culture medium in Petri dishes. When few bacteria are present, sporulation on insect bodies only takes place in a high relative humidity. A relative humidity of 93 % is already below the limit necessary for sporulation. Concentration effects Experiments with spores in quantities sufficient to kill second instar hoppers have shown that considerable differences in activity exist within the twelve strains studied. The LD 50 of a strain isolated from Polyphylla olivieri CAST. has been determined. The inclination of the regression line representing the relation between the logarithm of the dose and the mortality in probits is fairly large and resembles the values obtained from the insect killing bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis BERL. In similar experiments the food of the hoppers was sprayed with a suspension of spores. These experiments have been performed on first, second and third instar larvae. It appears that the susceptibility of the hoppers to the fungus decreases only slightly during aging, but the incubation period becomes longer in older larvae. Dosage experiments may also be performed per os with blastospores from shake cultures. CONCLUSIONS In the past the use of insect killing materials, containing M. anisopliae gave only rather unsatisfactory results. However, from the present investigation it appears that the fungus possesses some features which may render it useful to control the desert locust especially larvae of the first and second instar. As it has been established that infection in this species may occur via the mouth, it is possible to induce a fungal infection even in air of a very low humidity, as is often found in the habitat of this insect species. The chance of inducing an epizootic, however, seems to be limited because sporulation of the fungus, essential for a spreading of the disease, requests a very high relative humidity. To determine the possibilities of oral infection in other insect species, it is necessary to study the conditions under which M. anisopliae becomes infectious. Also the doses of spores which are needed to cause high mortality within a short time should be determined. Only after this has been done it will be possible to derive the conditions for practical application of this biological control agent. Of course technical factors and production costs will be decisive for its eventual use. Fundamental research is needed in order to select highly virulent strains and to maintain their virulence or to increase it by physical or chemical methods. It is also essential to investigate the specificity of the various strains to harmful and useful insects, as well as their possible effects on vertebrates, though the latter seems unlikely in view of the existing literature. Technical possibilities and the economics of mass-production will finally be decisive for the use...|$|E
