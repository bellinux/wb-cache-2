500|$|The FBI speculated {{from the}} {{beginning}} that Cooper did not survive his jump. [...] "Diving into the wilderness without a plan, without the right equipment, in such terrible conditions, he probably never even got his 'chute open," [...] said Carr. Even if he did land safely, agents contended that survival in the mountainous terrain would have been all but impossible without an accomplice at a predetermined landing point. This would have required a precisely timed jump—necessitating, in turn, cooperation from the flight crew. There is no evidence that Cooper requested or received any such help from the crew, nor that he had any clear idea where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> jumped into the stormy, overcast darkness.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Jack's fiftieth {{birthday}} is approaching {{and he has}} received home movies {{of some of his}} earlier birthdays from his mother, Collen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch). While watching the tapes, Jack discovers just how happy <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was younger, and is determined to reclaim that happiness and innocence. After examining a list he made while he was younger, he discovers that he has done all of the things but one, befriending Batman. Thus, he arranges for actor Adam West, who played Batman, to come to his birthday party. At the party, however, West calls Jack by the wrong name, leading him to realize that he is in fact unhappy, despite his accomplishments. [...] In an effort to reclaim his happiness, Jack attempts to find the same toy that made him so happy on his tenth birthday, a model of an Apollo Lunar Module. He buys one from a vintage toy store, but still remains unhappy.|$|E
500|$|After {{a two-month}} break from their travels with the Doctor, his companions, Amy Pond and her husband, Rory Williams, receive a [...] "TARDIS blue"-coloured {{envelope}} providing a time, date and set of coordinates {{leading them to}} Utah. They arrive to meet River Song (Alex Kingston), who also received an envelope, and the Doctor, now 1,103 years old, 194 years older than <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> last saw them. He takes them to a picnic at a nearby lake, telling them he is taking them {{on a trip to}} [...] "Space 1969." [...] Amy catches a glimpse of a mysterious figure from a distance, but appears to immediately forget about it after she looks away. Later, a figure in an American astronaut suit emerges from the lake; the Doctor approaches it but warns his companions not to interfere. The astronaut shoots the Doctor, causing him to begin to regenerate, but his companions are horrified to witness the astronaut shoot him again, killing him before he can fully regenerate. The three are met by Canton Everett Delaware III (William Morgan Sheppard) who also received an envelope and was instructed to bring a can of gasoline, which the group then uses to give the Doctor a Viking-style funeral.|$|E

500|$|In recent years, {{the words}} of the hymn have been changed in some {{religious}} publications to downplay a sense of imposed self-loathing by its singers. The second line, [...] "That saved a wretch like me!" [...] has been rewritten as [...] "That saved and strengthened me", [...] "save a soul like me", or [...] "that saved and set me free". Kathleen Norris in her book Amazing Grace: A Vocabulary of Faith characterizes this transformation of the original words as [...] "wretched English" [...] making the line that replaces the original [...] "laughably bland". Part of the reason for this change has been the altered interpretations of what wretchedness and grace means. Newton's Calvinistic view of redemption and divine grace formed his perspective that he considered himself a sinner so vile that he was unable to change his life or be redeemed without God's help. Yet his lyrical subtlety, in Steve Turner's opinion, leaves the hymn's meaning open to a variety of Christian and non-Christian interpretations. [...] "Wretch" [...] also represents a period in Newton's life when he saw himself outcast and miserable, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was enslaved in Sierra Leone; his own arrogance was matched by how far he had fallen in his life.|$|E
2500|$|Constitution {{typically}} {{has implications}} for views on persistence: [...] how does an object persist over time if any of its parts (materials) change or are removed, {{as is the case}} with humans who lose cells, change height, hair color, memories, and yet we are said to be the same person today as we were when we were first born. For example, Ted Sider is the same today as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was born—he just changed. But how can this be if many parts of Ted today did not exist when Ted was just born? Is it possible for things, such as organisms to persist? And if so, how? There are several views that attempt to answer this question. Some of the views are as follows (note, there are several other views): ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2001 interview, Rowling said Voldemort {{was invented}} as a nemesis for Harry Potter (the protagonist of the novels), and she {{intentionally}} did not flesh out Voldemort's backstory at first. [...] "The basic idea [...] didn't {{know he was}} a wizard ... And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position {{to find out how}} that could be, that he wouldn't know what <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> ... <b>When</b> <b>he</b> was one year old, the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harry—he tried to curse him. ... Harry has to find out, before we find out. And—so—but for some mysterious reason the curse didn't work on Harry. So he's left with this lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard, who has been in hiding ever since." ...|$|E

2500|$|Douglas was {{nominated}} for an Academy Award for the role, with his costar Anthony Quinn winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar as Paul Gauguin, van Gogh's friend. Douglas won a Golden Globe award, although Minnelli said Douglas should have won an Oscar: [...] "He achieved a moving and memorable portrait of the artist—a man of massive creative power, triggered by severe emotional stress, the fear and horror of madness." [...] Douglas himself called his acting role as Van Gogh a painful experience: [...] "Not only did I look like Van Gogh, I was the same age <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> committed suicide." [...] His wife said he often remained in character in his personal life: [...] "When he was doing Lust for Life, he came home in that red beard of Van Gogh's, wearing those big boots, stomping around the house — it was frightening." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former Australian cricket team coach John Buchanan voiced {{his opinion}} that Tendulkar had become {{susceptible}} to the short ball early in his innings {{because of a lack}} of footwork. Buchanan also believes Tendulkar has a weakness while playing left-arm pace. He was affected by a series of injuries since 2004. Since then Tendulkar's batting has tended to be less attacking. Explaining this change in his batting style, he has acknowledged that he is batting differently because, firstly, no batsman can bat the same way for the entire length of a long career and, secondly, he is a senior member of the team now and thus has more responsibility. During the early part of his career, he was a more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball. Ian Chappell, former Australian player, remarked in 2007 that [...] "Tendulkar now, is nothing like the player <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was a young bloke".|$|E
2500|$|The {{publication}} of Sexual Behavior in the Human Female prompted even more intensive news coverage: Kinsey {{appeared on the}} cover of the August 24, 1953, issue of Time. The national news magazine featured two articles on the scientist, one focusing on his research, career and new book, the other on his background, personality, and lifestyle. In the magazine's cover portrait, [...] "Flowers, birds, and a bee surround Kinsey; the mirror-of-Venus female symbol decorates his bow tie." [...] The lead article concludes with the following observation: [...] "'Kinsey...has done for sex what Columbus did for geography,' declared a pair of enthusiasts...forgetting that Columbus did not know where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> got there.... Kinsey's work contains much that is valuable, but it must not be mistaken for the last word." [...] That same year, Kinsey appeared as a character in an episode of the Jack Benny TV program (September 15, 1953), in which he and his research were written into a sketch about Benny's 'fantasy' about Marilyn Monroe, a guest on the program.|$|E

Miriam then forces a now hugely stressed Annabel to tell her own [...] "ghost story" [...] of her marriage, insisting she needs to know now. So Annabel talks of how they met at a sales conference; how they saw films together, her liking romantic comedies, him liking violent blockbusters; how they started sleeping together and got married to formalise the arrangement; how one day he snapped over something trivial and hit her; how sweet <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> apologised afterwards; how distant he grew {{the rest of the}} time; how she ended up provoking him to get his attention this way. Miriam asks if she enjoyed being hit, adding that she doesn't know any more if she enjoyed what happened to her. She muses the people you hurt most are the people you love, and before returning indoors, says to Annabel: [...] "I love you".|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "Childe" [...] is an honorific once {{given to}} young aristocratic {{men who had}} not yet {{attained}} knighthood, and its use in the play's title is a reference to Lord Byron's poem, Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. [...] The drama begins with Ada, the Countess of Lovelace, writing her will. She is a mathematician and the daughter of the infamous George Gordon, Lord Byron, a man reputed to be [...] "mad, bad, and dangerous to know." [...] She is dying of a painful cancer at age thirty-six, the same age <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> died. [...] Separated from him while he lived, she now hates his memory. [...] As her own end is near, however, she desires {{to know more about the}} man. [...] Her medicines stimulate her imagination, and she envisions him alive again. [...] In incisive, witty dialogue she digs into the truth behind the legends surrounding her father. [...] Six other actors play a diverse range of characters as she observes scenes from Byron's life, including his youthful incestuous relations with his sister, his homosexual adventures, his foolish marriage, and the causes of his disapprobation by British society.|$|E
