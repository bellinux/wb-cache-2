It also features several clips from his time in The X Factor, from his first audition to the moment he was announced the winner and performed his single to close the series. Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne, Dannii Minogue, Louis Walsh, Dermot O'Leary and runner-up Rhydian Roberts all feature within the clips.|$|E
5|$|Two {{vertices}} in a {{directed graph}} {{are said to}} be strongly connected to each other if there is a directed path {{from one to the other}} and vice versa. This is an equivalence relation, and the vertices of the graph may be partitioned into strongly connected components, subsets within which every two vertices are strongly connected. There are several efficient linear time algorithms for finding the strongly connected components of a graph, based on depth first search: Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm and the path-based strong component algorithm each perform a single depth first search. Kosaraju's algorithm performs two depth first searches, but <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>simple.</b>|$|E

5|$|Poliomyelitis {{is caused}} by {{infection}} {{with a member of}} the genus Enterovirus known as poliovirus (PV). This group of RNA viruses colonize the gastrointestinal tract — specifically the oropharynx and the intestine. The incubation time (to the first signs and symptoms) ranges from three to 35 days, with a more common span of six to 20 days. PV infects and causes disease in humans alone. Its structure <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>simple,</b> composed of a single (+) sense RNA genome enclosed in a protein shell called a capsid. In addition to protecting the virus’s genetic material, the capsid proteins enable poliovirus to infect certain types of cells. Three serotypes of poliovirus have been identified—poliovirus type 1 (PV1), type 2 (PV2), and type 3 (PV3)—each with a slightly different capsid protein. All three are extremely virulent and produce the same disease symptoms. PV1 is the most commonly encountered form, and the one most closely associated with paralysis.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} helium {{that must be}} {{decanted}} <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>simple</b> to calculate: Multiply the desired gas fraction of helium (FHe) by the total filling pressure (Ptot) to get partial pressure of helium (PHe). In {{the case of the}} Tx 20/40, in a 230 bar cylinder, this would be 230bar x 40% = 92bar (or for a 3,000psi fill, it would require 3,000 x 40% = 1,200 psi of helium).|$|E

25|$|The synagogue was {{originally}} a single-storey building until a second-storey balcony was added. The balcony {{is reserved for}} female {{members of the community}} during the prayer service. Jewish women do not have the duty to learn Hebrew and read the Torah. Because the sacred duty of reading the Torah falls only on the men, the women's section <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>simple.</b> The section is also very small because few women attended the service. Jewish law exempts women because of their obligations at home.|$|E
25|$|The house <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>simple</b> in {{plan and}} elegant in execution. The main {{entrance}} accesses a foyer with steps {{leading up to}} the major circulation hall through wooden and stained-glass double-doors. A sweeping stairway, {{toward the back of the}} house on the left side of the hall accesses the second floor, which is similar in plan to the first. All floors within the house are parquet and ceilings are of hand-painted decorative pressed metal. The floors were installed during the last restoration and the pressed-metal ceilings are all original.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the grandness of Rosary Square and the various basilicas, the grotto at Massabielle where St Bernadette's visions took place <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>simple</b> and stark. The recess of the grotto itself is undecorated, although a plain stone altar and lectern have been placed there so that Mass can be celebrated. Above the main recess is the niche where the apparitions took place and Fabisch's statue now stands. A large stand of candles next to the altar is kept burning throughout the year. During the pilgrimage season, 2 pilgrimage masses are usually celebrated each morning at the grotto.|$|E
25|$|The second Versailles version (267 × 230cm; 105 × 90½in) shows a {{black and}} white horse with {{complete}} tack but lacking the martingale. The girth is red. The cloak is orange-red, the collar is black, and the embroidery of the gauntlet <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>simple</b> and almost unnoticeable. The scarf tied around Napoleon's waist is light blue. The officer with the sabre is again masked by the tail of the horse. Napoleon's features are older, he has shorter hair, and—as in the Charlottenburg version—there is the faint trace of a smile. The embroidery and the style of the bicorne suggest that the picture was completed after 1804. The picture is not dated but is signed L.DAVID.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} notion in CGT {{is that of}} the solved game. For example, tic-tac-toe {{is considered}} a solved game, as it can be proven that any game will result in a draw if both players play optimally. Deriving similar results for games with rich combinatorial structures is difficult. For instance, in 2007 it was announced that checkers has been weakly solvedoptimal play by both sides also leads to a drawbut this result was a computer-assisted proof. Other real world games are mostly too complicated to allow complete analysis today, although the theory has had some recent successes in analyzing Go endgames. Applying CGT to a position attempts to determine the optimum sequence of moves for both players until the game ends, and by doing so discover the optimum move in any position. In practice, this process is torturously difficult unless the game <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>simple.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{common loon}} is {{seasonally}} monogamous; pairs form and stay {{together for the}} breeding season and separate when they migrate in winter.

Copulation takes place ashore, often on the nest site, repeated daily until the eggs are laid. The preceding courtship <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>simple,</b> with mutual bill-dipping and dives. The displays towards intruders, such as bow-jumping (an alternation of fencing and bill-dipping postures) and rushing (running [...] "along the surface with its wings either folded or half-extended and flapping at about the same speed as when taking off") are often misinterpreted as courtship.|$|E

[...] She said that she thinks West is brilliant and praised him for speaking his mind all the time. Jack White, a vocal advocate of analog recording, remarked that the album [...] "is obviously recorded on Pro Tools but sounds unbelievable, because it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>simple</b> and there aren't a lot of components going on, and this really allows the songs to shine.

[...] Through his character of a bahuroopiya, Talpade was required to perform mimicry. While {{he was good at}} mimicry in college, it was during the filming of Iqbal, Kukunoor noted this talent of his and thus Dor came into Talpade's hands.
