Only nine other named storms are known to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so.</b> Irene {{was the first of}} three Atlantic-to-Pacific {{crossover}} tropical cyclones in the 1970s, all three of which took eastern Pacific names starting with the letter O.|$|E
5|$|Laurence Olivier's 1948 moody {{black-and-white}} Hamlet won Best Picture and Best Actor Oscars, and is still, , {{the only}} Shakespeare film to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so.</b> His interpretation stressed the Oedipal overtones of the play, and cast 28-year-old Eileen Herlie as Hamlet's mother, opposite himself, at 41, as Hamlet.|$|E
5|$|On 13 June the {{following}} year, at Euro 2016 Rosický became the oldest player to represent Czech Republic {{in the competition}} {{at the age of}} 35. The record is unique for Rosický as he also holds the record for being the youngest player to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so,</b> having featured at Euro 2000 for his nation as a 19-year old.|$|E
50|$|The Council {{has issued}} policy {{statements}} {{from time to}} time. on various issues.

5|$|Both Dr. Lee and Dr. Evans {{attempt to}} {{diagnose}} {{what is going}} on with Michael. They both see it as a coping mechanism, and both insist that the other reality is a dream. To try to prove this to Michael, Dr. Evans has Michael read a part of the United States Constitution, as if that reality was a dream, Michael could not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so,</b> unless he had memorized the Constitution. Michael learned that he had alcohol in his system the night of the car accident, with Dr. Lee hypothesizing that Michael has this dream because he feels guilty for killing his son.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 she {{published}} {{her second}} occult novel, The Winged Bull—which was again reviewed in The Times Literary Review—and in 1936 her third, The Goat-Foot God. In 1938 Fortune wrote a fourth occult novel, The Sea Priestess, which was eventually self-published through the Fraternity after being declined by Williams and Norgate, who had published the previous two. Her final novel, Moon Magic, was apparently left unfinished {{prior to the}} outbreak of the Second World War; a protégé later completed it, claiming to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> through channeling Blavatsky's disembodied spirit, and it was published posthumously.|$|E
5|$|India {{made its}} first tour of Australia in the 1947–48 season. On 15 November, Bradman made 172 against them for an Australian XI at Sydney, his 100th {{first-class}} century. The first non-Englishman to achieve the milestone, Bradman remains the only Australian to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so.</b> In five Tests, he scored 715 runs (at 178.75average). His last double century (201) came at Adelaide, and he scored a century in each innings of the Melbourne Test. On {{the eve of the}} Fifth Test, he announced that the match would be his last in Australia, although he would tour England as a farewell.|$|E

5|$|It {{must seem}} {{to the reader}} that this Colonel Beriah Norton was a traitor to his own people, but {{what could he do}} but give in to Grey's command! Grey had the force and the power and could have {{destroyed}} the towns on the island in half a day, and would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> if they had resisted in any way. In the diary, September 12th and 13th are omitted. Those were the days when the British troops were ravaging the island from Edgartown to Gay Head.|$|E
5|$|Like Lovinescu, other {{advocates of}} modernist {{literature}} rejected most of Cerna's contributions. One {{of the first}} to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> is Ovid Densusianu, who stated his belief that an artist's work should be separated from his life. Lovinescu, who commented on Densusianu and his thoughts on Cerna, opined that Densusianu had a tendency to reject all poets who registered popular success, and that he treated Dimitrie Anghel's work in much the same way.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Maastricht Treaty obliges most EU {{member states}} to adopt the euro upon meeting certain {{monetary}} and budgetary convergence criteria, although not all states <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so.</b> The United Kingdom and Denmark negotiated exemptions, while Sweden (which joined the EU in 1995, after the Maastricht Treaty was signed) turned down the euro in a 2003 referendum, and has circumvented the obligation to adopt the euro by not meeting the monetary and budgetary requirements. All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 have pledged to adopt the euro in due course.|$|E

5|$|Thieu then {{authorized}} Operation Cuu Long, {{in which}} ARVN ground forces, including mechanized and armoured units, drove west and northwest up {{the eastern side}} of the Mekong River from 9 May – 1 July. A combined force of 110 Vietnamese Navy and 30 U.S. vessels proceeded up the Mekong to Prey Veng, permitting IV Corps ground forces to move westward to Phnom Penh and to aid ethnic Vietnamese seeking flight to South Vietnam. Those who did not wish to be repatriated were then forcibly expelled. Surprisingly, North Vietnamese forces did not oppose the evacuation, though they could easily <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{he scored}} his debut hundred, Bangladesh's Mohammad Ashraful became the {{youngest}} player to score a century in Test cricket, {{at the age of}} 17 years and 61 days. Adam Voges is the oldest player to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so,</b> aged 35 years and 243 days when he scored 130 not out for Australia against the West Indies in June 2015. The 100th player to score a century on Test debut is South African Stephen Cook, who scored 115 against England in Centurion in January 2016. The most recent player to score a century on debut is the English batsman Keaton Jennings.|$|E
5|$|When {{it came to}} {{personal}} politics, Crawford aligned herself as a Democrat who greatly supported, and admired, the administrations of John F. Kennedy and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. She was once noted as saying: The Democratic party is one that I've always observed. I have struggled greatly in life from the day I was born and I am honored {{to be a part}} of something that focuses on working class citizens and molds them into a proud specimen. Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Kennedy <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> much in that regard for the two generations they've won over during their career course.|$|E

5|$|With his {{performance}} against Indiana, Robinson {{became the first}} player in Division I FBS history to have two regular season games with 200 yards rushing and 200 yards passing. Seven others have accomplished the feat (including Pat White, Vince Young and Antwaan Randle El), but none <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> {{more than once in}} the regular season. Vince Young accomplished this feat once in the regular season and once in the Rose Bowl.|$|E
5|$|You {{have more}} to do than simply abstain from riotous proceedings. You must not stand behind riots and let violators of the law promote the {{destruction}} of property. You are responsible for the violence that has been done, whether you were actually engaged in it or not. You on your part must drive away from you the evil-disposed people who <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> much harm, and discountenance in the plainest way everything tending to violence.|$|E
5|$|After his tournament {{victory in}} July 2007, Asashōryū decided {{to skip the}} {{regional}} summer tour of Tōhoku and Hokkaidō beginning on 3 August because of injury. The medical forms submitted to the Japan Sumo Association indicated that injuries to his left elbow and a stress fracture in his lower back would require six weeks of rest to heal. However, he was then seen on television participating in a soccer match for charity with Hidetoshi Nakata in his homeland of Mongolia. He was reported to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> {{at the request of}} the Japanese Foreign Ministry and the Mongolian government. However, the suggestion that he had exaggerated the extent of his injuries to avoid his duties on the exhibition tour caused a media storm.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{paleontology}} {{has often}} classified Archaeopteryx {{as the most}} primitive bird. It is not {{thought to be a}} true ancestor of modern birds, but rather, a close relative of that ancestor. Nonetheless, Archaeopteryx was often used as a model of the true ancestral bird. Several authors <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so.</b> Lowe (1935) and Thulborn (1984) questioned whether Archaeopteryx truly was the first bird. They suggested that Archaeopteryx was a dinosaur that was no more closely related to birds than were other dinosaur groups. Kurzanov (1987) suggested that Avimimus was more likely to be the ancestor of all birds than Archaeopteryx. Barsbold (1983) and Zweers and Van den Berge (1997) noted that many maniraptoran lineages are extremely birdlike, and they suggested that different groups of birds may have descended from different dinosaur ancestors.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers’ {{record for}} {{consecutive}} games {{lost in a}} single season would be surpassed twice; by the 2001 Carolina Panthers, who lost fifteen consecutive games after winning their opener, and the 2008 Detroit Lions, the only winless team to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> in a 16-game schedule. Ten NFL teams since the 1976 Buccaneers have lost 15 or 16 games in a season, but the Buccaneers’ 26-game losing streak from 1976 to 1977 still stands as the longest in modern NFL history. The aforementioned Detroit Lions have come the closest to matching the Buccaneers' losing streak, having lost 19 consecutive games between 2007 until finally winning in week 3 of the 2009 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{minister}} {{charged with}} responsibility for the Act is required to publish in the Government Gazette a list stating the Government departments which are authorized departments {{for the purposes of}} the Act, and the names and addresses for service of the solicitors for the departments. As of 7 December 2005, no such list had been published. For this reason, in Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs (2005), decided on that date, the High Court held that instead of instituting the action against the Minister for Home Affairs and the Commissioner of Police, the applicants should <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> against the Attorney-General. Nonetheless, the suit should not be dismissed as this was a procedural irregularity that could be cured by substituting the Attorney-General as the respondent.|$|E
