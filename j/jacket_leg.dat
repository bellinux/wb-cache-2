40|$|The {{recommended}} force-deformation curves for {{supply vessels}} collision presented in NORSOK N- 004 {{are based on}} simplified methods and tests developed more than 30 years ago. The purpose of this work is {{to contribute to the}} development of new design guidance by investigating the force-deformation relationships for a supply vessel of 2250 tons displacement colliding with an inclined <b>jacket</b> <b>leg.</b> Reviews of simple calculation models regarding ship side collisions and deformation of platform legs subjected to impact loads have been conducted. Finite element models of unstiffened columns and a side structure in the mid ship area of a supply vessel have been developed using the software Patran. Emphasis has been placed on choosing boundary conditions that reflect the behavior of the connected structures in a realistic way. The <b>jacket</b> <b>leg</b> has been constrained to small axial translation, were the translation is governed by an axial stiffness. The ship side model has been given a constant velocity of 2 m/s and the sides have been constrained from moving in any other degree of freedom than translation in the y-direction. Nonlinear finite element analyses of the ship side impacting a battered unstiffened <b>jacket</b> <b>leg</b> have been performed using the explicit solver LS-DYNA. 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0 m diameter columns with varying wall thicknesses have been used. Force- deformation and energy-deformation curves have been plotted and evaluated for all cases. Most of the analyses were found to be ductile or shared energy design, while the 2. 0 m diameter column with a shell thickness of 60 mm was found to be very close to strength design. Impact analyses with rigid columns of 1. 0, 1. 5 and 3. 0 m diameters were performed. The ship force-deformation relationship was found to not be affected by the increase in column diameter. The resistance to local denting of the <b>jacket</b> <b>leg</b> was evaluated and compared to the simplified calculation model in NORSOK N- 004. The NORSOK curves for maximum collision contact zone width fit well for the 1. 5 m diameter case, but were found to be non-conservative for the 1. 0 m diameter columns and too conservative for the 2. 0 m columns. The NORSOK curve corresponding to a point load fit well with the columns with small wall thicknesses, especially for small indentations. Analyses using a material model including initiation of fracture were conducted and evaluated. Fracture was in no case found in the <b>jacket</b> <b>leg,</b> but was initiated in the ship side. The overall effect of including fracture on the force- deformation curves proved to be rather small. Local buckling of the jacket leg?s cross section was briefly investigated. The effect on the load bearing capacity of the <b>jacket</b> <b>leg</b> was found to be small, but this was only considered for the analysis with 1. 5 m diameter and 30 mm wall thickness and a general conclusion could not be drawn. The recommended NORSOK curves for force-deformation were evaluated and found to underestimate the impact force of a supply vessel. The proposed curve for a 5000 tons displacement ship was found to be suitable for a supply vessel of 2250 tons. The results from rigid column impact implied that the NORSOK standard curves can be applied for 1. 0 and 2. 0 m diameter columns in addition to the standard 1. 5 m diameter. </p...|$|E

40|$|The jacket, or template, {{structures}} {{are still the}} most common offshore structures used for drilling and production. Some structures contain enlarged legs, which are suitable for self-buoyancy during its installation at the site. Fixed jacket structures consist of tubular members interconnected to form a three-dimensional space frame. Hence, the jacket structure can be categorized into a column structure. These structures usually have four to eight legs battered to achieve stability against not only toppling in waves but also axial compressive loads. Main piles which are tubular are usually carried with the jackets and driven through the <b>jacket</b> <b>legs</b> into the seafloor. The piles bear the axial compressive loads due to the component of the main deck and these loads are distributed to all the <b>jacket</b> <b>legs.</b> The configuration of a typical member on the jacket structure has significant influence to buckling strength. Horizontal and diagonal braces {{play an important role}} to resist the axial compressive load on the <b>jacket</b> <b>legs.</b> Although only the axial load acts on the <b>jacket</b> <b>legs,</b> the local and global deformation of the structural member due to this load must be taken into account.

Two kinds of fixed jacket offshore {{structures are}} taken as the object of the analysis. Only the axial load is considered and it is applied both two structures. The material and dimensions of the two structures are assumed to be constant and homogenous. The crack extension and corrosion are not considered in the analysis. To assess the buckling strength of these structures due to the configuration of symmetrical and asymmetrical shape, the Finite Element Method (FEM) is used. As a fundamental case, the buckling strength analysis is performed on these structures by taking two dimensional planes (2 D) into consideration to obtain the critical buckling load for local deformation of the structural member. The result obtained by FEA is compared with the analytical solution and the applicability of the FEM is further applied to investigate for the global structural deformation...|$|R

40|$|The {{assessment}} {{had been}} conducted for shipside collision against unstiffened, inclined <b>jacket</b> <b>leg</b> segment (column). The inclined column has been modelled with horizontal-to-vertical ratio of 1 / 7. Two types of boundary {{conditions of the}} column has been modelled; perfectly clamped boundary conditions (clamped or fixed) and boundary conditions with axial flexibility (axial spring). For clamped column, two different impact locations have been simulated, namely middle span impact and quarter span impact. For each impact location, three (3) design categories have been analysed; ductile design (Rigid Ship versus deformable column), integrated design (deformable ship versus deformable column), and strength design (Rigid column versus deformable ship). For rigid ship and integrated cases, three (3) column wall thicknesses had been simulated to present the transition from ductile to integrated and strength categories. From the force-displacement relationships, the force demanded to generate the same displacement both on the column and shipside is slightly higher for middle span impact than for quarter span impact, for all column wall thickness assessed herein. However, the resistance to indentation appeared to be significantly higher for middle span impact after the contact area had developed until over {{the height of the}} shipside. Considering the analysis results from fixed columns, the column with the wall thickness of 40 mm under middle span impact had been chosen as main representative model to reveal the influence of the axial flexibility to the capacity of the column. Two (2) types of the spring arrangement on each column-end have been modelled, namely the multiple springs and the single springs. For multiple springs type, two different spring coefficients have been evaluated, namely the equivalent and the unequal (nodal) spring stiffness. The spring coefficients are calculated according the analysis results generated on USFOS, taking only the linear elastic spring stiffness. The ‘real’ axial flexibility proved no major contribution to the overall resistance and deformation of the column. Therefore, assuming a fixed column is prudent for practical design. </p...|$|E

When transporting hydrocarbons from seabed to top side on a jacket platform {{there is always the}} need of a riser. Risers are attached to the platform leg or bracing by means of riser clamps. The riser loads together with environmental forces transfers large stresses to the clamps. To ensure that the clamps can withstand these loads over the design life, several analyses have to be performed. This thesis covers the design methodology and the most important analyses using a FE (Finite Element) tool, on one of the clamps designed by Subsea 7 for the Ekofisk 2 / 4 -B platform. Basically three analyses are performed; ULS (Ultimate Limit State) stress check and FLS (Fatigue Limit State) check for the clamp and the bolts, in addition to a non-linear slippage analysis. The action loads from the riser are given by the jacket operator. The environmental forces on the riser and the clamps are calculated to find the largest load combination in the horizontal- and vertical direction. For the various analyses different load- and material factors are applied to the forces. The worst load combination is applied in the analysis which is conducted in ANSYS, FE tool. The linear FE analysis has to be setup correctly to obtain good results. The results for the ULS stress check are in general within allowable limits, i. e. below design yield. There is however some peak stresses in local areas that are above design yield. Common practice is to conduct a non-linear analysis and check if the peak stresses are due to secondary effects. To disregard the secondary effects the plastic strain obtained in the non-linear analysis have to be insignificant. The results obtained indicate that the peak stresses are due to secondary effects, hence the clamp meets the requirements for the ULS criteria. In the FLS check three hot spots is checked including a weld. Stress ranges are obtained from the cyclical loads and the number of cycles during the design life calculated.

40|$|Ingenium AS is {{developing}} a new concept for transporting and installing fixed wind turbines, mainly jacket structures. As {{a part of the}} installation the jacket is lowered down to the seabed from a free hanging configuration, supported by a hydraulic frame. This operation is analyzed by use of the computer program Orcaflex, where the structure is modeled as rigid. Two critical scenarios are identified. In Scenario 1 a the jacket is 10 m above seabed. Here, the jacket may collide with the support frame if the motions are sufficiently large. In Scenario 2 a, the jacket is 3 m above seabed, and large motions may cause troubles under installation. Both these Scenarios are modeled and investigated by running response analyses in Orcaflex. The effect of applying a passive heave compensation system is also investigated. Damping characteristics for the system are provided by Ingenium. By these damping characteristics, the heave compensation system is implemented in the Orcaflex models. Contact between the support frame and the <b>jacket</b> <b>legs</b> may occur if the jacket motions are sufficiently large. The effect of applying a bumper system to reduce the stress in the <b>jacket</b> <b>legs</b> is investigated.

40|$|AbstractIn this article, a {{comparison}} of the moments and forces at the joints of a jacket structure is made between fully coupled aero-hydro-elastic simulations in HAWC 2 and uncoupled load predictions in the finite element software Abaqus. The jacket sub structure is modelled in moderate deep waters of 50 m and designed for the 5 MW NREL baseline wind turbine. External conditions are based on wind and wave joint distribution for a site in the North Sea. The turbulent wind field in HAWC 2 is generated by random values, defined by the Mann Turbulence model, for each operational mean wind speed. A four-legged jacket structure similar to the Upwind reference jacket is developed in the Abaqus environment, to which is added the transition piece and tower. The aeroelastic loads determined in normal operating conditions of the turbine is integrated and centralized as nodal forces and moments acting at the tower top of the finite element model. Hydrodynamic loads from the incoming waves are computed using the Morison equation and based on a nonlinear irregular wave field. Velocities, accelerations and amplitudes of the wave field as well as tower top forces and moments are used as inputs for the structural analysis in Abaqus. The fully coupled simulation is implemented and performed in HAWC 2. In the uncoupled case, the loads (wave loads and tower base loads) are analysed by an implicit structural Finite Element Analysis (Abaqus 6. 11 - 1). A subroutine is used as a preprocessor generating a beam element model and linking the loads to the components as nodal forces. In both simulation cases, the integrated loads acting on the <b>jacket</b> <b>legs</b> are computed as time series and as damage equivalent loading. The analysis and comparison of the fully coupled and decoupled simulation method show that the results vary depending on the structural stiffness and the applied wave loads. Variation in the amplitudes of the moments and forces on the <b>jacket</b> <b>legs</b> up to 25 % was observed between the results obtained from coupled and uncoupled simulations...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} modeling {{techniques of the}} local joint flexibility on the local dynamics of a jacket support structure for an offshore wind turbine is investigated. Two numerical models of a jacket supporting a generic turbine are analyzed in the aero-hydro-servo-elastic tool ADCoS-Offshore. The first model is set up with Euler-Bernoulli beam elements, while the second model utilizes superelements for the joints’ representation and Euler-Bernoulli beams for the remaining parts of the structure. Time-domain simulations are run for deterministic and stochastic load cases, and local jacket dynamics are investigated. The local response of the braces is compared with the global response at the <b>jacket</b> <b>legs</b> in terms of power spectral densities (PSDs). Damage equivalent loads (DELs) are calculated at several positions along the jacket to capture the impact of local and global dynamics on those loads. It is observed that the superelement model leads in general to higher fatigue loads than the beam model. A methodology to remove the global motion component from the displacement time history of the brace central joint is discussed. Larger displacements of the brace central joints are observed for the superelement model than for the beam model. It is recommended to use superelement modeling technique for a more accurate representation of joints in the jacket support structures...|$|R

40|$|Collision {{events may}} have severe consequences, {{and it is}} {{important}} to design both ship and offshore structures so that they have sufficient resistance to a collision event. The main purpose of the work herein is to improve the methods for description of the material behavior in nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA), and to study the physics of the collision process through numerical simulations of both experiments and full-scale scenarios. Simplified methods are proposed based on the findings. The shape of the stress-strain curve of the steel material is found to have a large effect on how strains localize in a deformation process, and thereby on the fracture initiation and propagation. Strain-rate hardening is found to be challenging with shell elements, especially w. r. t. dynamic fracture strain, and can increase the uncertainty if not carefully calibrated. Determination of the design material concept is discussed, ensuring that the materials representing load and resistance are given appropriate safety factors. A novel way of separating two different mesh scale effects termed geometric and material is proposed. The micromechanical process of fracture is discussed, and related to the macromechanical process that can be captured with coarse shell elements. The dependence of strain-state and length scale is investigated. Many of the popular fracture criteria are implemented in LS-DYNA and a large simulation program is conducted with different experiments and many mesh sizes. The accuracy of the fracture criteria is assessed. An extension of the BWH fracture criterion is proposed, in which post-necking effects can be included. Through a combination of coupled damage and a strainstate dependent erosion criterion, a more robust fracture prediction with reduced mesh dependence is achieved. NLFEA is used as virtual experiments to study supply vessel collisions with offshore platforms. A pressure-area relation is proposed for the pressures required to initiate crushing of the bulbous bow of a supply vessel. A simplified model is proposed for strength-design of stiffened panels, combining a roof-top mechanism with the stiffener shear capacity in an incremental approach. A refined method for strength-design of <b>jacket</b> <b>legs</b> and braces is proposed, based on the characteristic strength Rc. Various challenges related to simulation of ice collision events are discussed, especially with respect to the material behavior of ice during fast compressive loading. The material behavior of ice is not well known, and has large statistical variations in properties. During a collision with damage to the ship, the changed geometry of the ship side will increase the confinement of the ice, thereby increasing its crushing pressure. All ice loads given in current rules and standards disregard this effect. Two experimental campaigns are performed to study the coupled deformation process as both ice and structure deforms, thereby investigating the effect of the confinement. The load exerted from the ice increases significantly when the structure deforms plastically, indicating that the coupled effect is important. The effect should be considered in updated rules and standards...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of analyses and discussions regarding the collision between the offshore vessel Big Orange XVIII and Ekofisk 2 / 4 W the 8 th of June 2009. The collision caused {{the bow of}} Big Orange to deform three meters back from its original position. On the jacket installation, several braces were teared loose and the structure was pushed out of position. Although the installation endured large structural damages, it did not collapse. Based on the reported damage from NPD and the NORSOK design methods, the collision energy {{was estimated to be}} 58. 7 MJ. The collision analyses were performed by analyzing Big Orange and Ekofisk 2 / 4 W in two separate uncoupled analyses. A model of Big Orange was made in Patran and analyzed in LS-DYNA. The first model of Big Orange had a 450 mm mesh, but was refined to a 200 mm mesh. The model of Ekofisk 2 / 4 W was made and analyzed in USFOS. The results from LS-DYNA were implemented as non-linear springs in the collision model in USFOS. Technical specifications regarding the vessel were provided by Ulstein Hatlø. Damage reports and structural arrangements regarding Ekofisk 2 / 4 W were provided by Conoco Philips. The model of 2 / 4 W was analyzed in several conditions: Pushover analyses in undamaged and damaged condition Static and dynamic ship collision analysis Collapse analysis The pushover analyses were mainly performed to verify that the model behaved as to be expected for this type of structure, and that it could be used for ship impact analysis. The static and dynamic ship collision analyses in USFOS had the non-linear springs from LS-DYNA implemented at the collision points to simulate the deformation of the bow in the ongoing collision. Two different dynamic collision models were tested. One model was unsupported, while one model had supports form the north and south bridges. The first collapse analyses were carried out by increasing the collision energy. This was done by increasing the vessel mass or velocity. The last collapse analyses were performed by changing the collision characteristics. The deformation pattern for the unsupported model was similar to the reported damage both in response and in dissipated energy. Both the static and dynamic analyses dissipated the same collision energy that was estimated following the NORSOK methods. The structure had severe deformations when the collision energy was increased by 10 %. The vessel speed would have been 5. 019 m/s with this energy increase. The results obtained from the dynamic analysis were not so similar to the recommended design curves in NORSOK, but gave lower forces for displacements. They were however similar to the results Amdahl and Johansen obtained from simulations in 2002. Using LS-DYNA, they obtained load-deformation characteristics for collisions between a ship bow, and vertical leg columns and oblique braces. Improvements proposed to NORSOK could be to update the design curves for collisions with <b>jacket</b> <b>legs</b> and columns of similar diameters. The values for these collisions are the same as for large diameter columns, and are overly conservative if used for smaller diameters. Because the non-linear springs in USFOS were based on mass and velocity from the actual event, the results from the collapse analysis may deviate from the actual response. To address this problem, the LS-DYNA collision model could be improved to check the results. </p...|$|R

40|$|Vibrations {{in marine}} {{offshore}} marine structures, due to various environmental loads, can reduce platform productivity, endanger safety, affect serviceability {{of the structure}} and have been attributing factors in several major accidents and failures in the marine and offshore industry {{over the last few}} decades. Controlling the vibrations in marine offshore structures potentially due to self-excited nonlinear hydrodynamic forces, large deformations and highly nonlinear responses, is challenging. While general vibration control strategies have been investigated and demonstrated to be effective for structural vibration mitigation, there currently is limited research highlighting the specific methods available for design engineers and researchers concerned with vibrations of marine offshore structures. This paper provides a review of vibration control techniques and their application for marine offshore structures. Initially, a review of the general approaches following the conventional categorization of passive, active, semi-active and hybrid is presented. This is then followed by a review of the specific marine offshore vibration control methods and a comparison of the approaches. The marine offshore structures considered in this review include <b>jacket</b> structures, tension <b>leg</b> platforms (TLPs), spar structures, floating production storage and offloading vessels (FPSOs) and riser structures. It can be found that the general trend is progressing towards semi-active and hybrid vibration control from passive or active control, as they provide more practical approaches for implementation, possessing the advantages of passive and active control systems...|$|R
40|$|The purpose {{with this}} report is to verify that the Edvard Grieg jacket {{structure}} has sufficient strength to withstand the loads imposed during the load out operation at Kv&# 230;rner Verdal. The structural analysis has been performed using the SESAM program system, ref. [14], employing the programme modules GENIE and SESTRA. The jacket model used for load out {{is based on the}} model used for inplace analysis modified to fit the boundary conditions of the load out. A ?Weight not to be exceeded? (WNE) of 15 000 tonnes have been used, ref. [9]. In the load out analysis the jacket model is supported on top of 800 mm long box members (pins) at each <b>jacket</b> launch runner <b>leg</b> main- and intermediate nodes in the launch runner area, i. e. 12 supports at each leg, ref. Figure 10. Differential settlements are applied as prescribed displacements at bottom of support pin members to reflect requirements given in chapter 5. 2. 3 of document LUN-KVE-FD- 0131 ?Design brief ? Temporary Phases?, ref. [7]. Description of differential settlements applied is given in chapter 5. 1. 4. 2. 2. The code checks of the jacket are performed according to NORSOK standards, ref. [1, 2 and 3], using SESAM module GENIE. 								The Saipem barge S 600 will be used during load out and sea transportation. The barge will be safely moored and free floating with stern against quay front during load out. </p...|$|R
40|$|Offshore {{wind farming}} is an {{industry}} under development and involves challenges. The farms might be located close to ship trading routes. This {{increases the risk of}} ship-wind farm impact, causing economic losses, environmental pollution and human fatalities. The first part of this report describes various bottom supported wind farm technologies and presents a discussion of the risk picture considering oil spill due to this collision event. A review of relevant standards is enclosed. The main part of this thesis considers finite element modelling and simulations of impact between a jacket supported wind turbine and a large oil tanker. The goal with these analyses is to study the possibility of achieving the Bundesamt für Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie standard "Design of Offshore Wind Turbines", requiring minor oil spill due to ship-wind turbine collision involving ship kinetic energy larger than 500 MJ. The standard requires that a risk analysis is performed to demonstrate that either the collision energy is absorbed by the structures or that it results in collapse of the wind turbine without damage of the ship hull. The wind turbine model is received from the company Virtual Prototyping. Geometric and load modifications are performed in order to obtain realistic results representative for the North Sea. The global response of the jacket is studied using the computer program USFOS. The ship is modelled drifting towards the corner of the <b>jacket,</b> hitting one <b>leg.</b> The ship is assumed to be rigid, not contributing to dissipate the collision energy. The contact between the structures is represented by a nonlinear spring. Different impact locations on the jacket are considered. Both collapse due to overall deformation of the installation and local damage of the tower is studied. In addition, failure of the nacelle bolts is investigated in order to verify the possibility of the nacelle dropping on the deck, penetrating the cargo tanks. </p...|$|R
