50|$|A {{traditional}} sequence {{early in}} the 20th century would leave topics such as algebra or geometry entirely for high school, and statistics until college, but newer standards introduce the basic principles needed for understanding these topics very early. For example, most American standards now require children to learn to recognize and extend patterns in kindergarten. This very basic form of algebraic reasoning is extended in elementary school to recognize patterns in functions and arithmetic operations, such as the distributive law, a key principle for doing high school algebra. Most curricula today encourage children to reason about geometric shapes and their properties in primary school as preparation for more advanced reasoning {{in a high school}} geometry course. Current standards require children to learn basic statistical ideas such as organizing data with bar charts. More sophisticated concepts such as algebraic expressions with numbers and letters, <b>geometric</b> <b>surface</b> area and statistical means and medians occur in sixth grade in the newest standards.|$|E

The main question of this thesis is the following: how many points, {{depending on the}} sampling model and surface genus, are needed to confidently reconstruct the original <b>geometric</b> <b>surface.</b> First we present different sampling models of surface points — the uniform and the random sample. We use topological methods, in particular persistent homology, to process our data. Using Javaplex software package we construct a filtration with Vietoris-Rips simplicial complexes and consider the bar-code diagram of its Betti numbers.

40|$|The {{invention}} is {{a system}} and method of compressing a DTM {{to be used in}} an Auto-GCAS system using a semi-regular geometric compression algorithm. In general, the invention operates by first selecting the boundaries of the three dimensional map to be compressed and dividing the three dimensional map data into regular areas. Next, a type of free-edged, flat <b>geometric</b> <b>surface</b> is selected which will be used to approximate terrain data of the three dimensional map data. The flat <b>geometric</b> <b>surface</b> is used to approximate terrain data for each regular area. The approximations are checked to determine if they fall within selected tolerances. If the approximation for a specific regular area is within specified tolerance, the data is saved for that specific regular area. If the approximation for a specific area falls outside the specified tolerances, the regular area is divided and a flat <b>geometric</b> <b>surface</b> approximation is made for each of the divided areas. This process is recursively repeated until all of the regular areas are approximated by flat geometric surfaces. Finally, the compressed three dimensional map data is provided to the automatic ground collision system for an aircraft...|$|E

Quality assessment metrics may allow {{a wide range of}} processes to be guided and evaluated, such as level of detail creation, compression, filtering and so on. Most computer graphics assets are composed of <b>geometric</b> <b>surfaces</b> on which several texture images can be mapped to make the rendering more realistic. While some quality assessment metrics exist for <b>geometric</b> <b>surfaces,</b> almost no research has been conducted on the evaluation of texture-mapped 3 D models. In this context, we present a new subjective study to evaluate the perceptual quality of textured meshes, based on a paired comparison protocol. We introduce both texture and geometry distortions on a set of 5 reference models to produce a database of 136 distorted models, evaluated using two rendering protocols. Based on analysis of the results, we propose two new metrics for visual quality assessment of textured mesh, as optimized linear combinations of accurate geometry and texture quality measurements. These proposed perceptual metrics outperform their counterparts in terms of correlation with human opinion. The database, along with the associated subjective scores, will be made publicly available on-line...|$|R

Dissolution rates were normalized to initial and final BET surface area, <b>geometric</b> <b>surface</b> area, mass and (for biotite only) geometric edge surface area. Constant (within error) dissolution rates were only obtained by normalizing to initial BET surface area for biotite.

In this study, final <b>geometric</b> <b>surface</b> area gave the smallest variation for anorthite dissolution rates and final geometric edge surface area for biotite dissolution rates.

40|$|Electrodes for {{cortical}} stimulation need {{to deliver}} current to neural tissue effectively and safely. We have developed electrodes {{with a novel}} annular geometry for use in cortical visual prostheses. Here we explore a critical question on the ideal annulus height to ensure electrical stimulation will be safe and effective. We implanted single electrodes into the motor cortex of anesthetized rats and measured the current required to evoke a motor response to stimulation, and the charge injection capacity of the electrodes. We compared platinum iridium electrodes with different annulus heights, with and without a coating of porous titanium nitride. Threshold charge densities to evoke a motor response ranged from 12 - 36 µC. cm^- 2. ph^- 1. Electrodes with larger <b>geometric</b> <b>surface</b> areas required higher currents to evoke responses, but lower charge densities. The addition of a porous titanium nitride coating did not significantly influence the current required to evoke a motor response. The charge injection capacity of both electrode types was significantly reduced in-vivo compared with in-vitro measurements. The measured charge injection capacity was 72 and 18 µC. cm^- 2. ph^- 1 for electrodes with and without a titanium nitride coating respectively. These results {{support the use of}} platinum iridium annular electrodes with annulus heights greater than 100 µm (<b>geometric</b> <b>surface</b> area of 38, 000 µm^ 2).
