500|$|Playwright Alan Bennett was {{particularly}} repulsed by Witchfinder. In his regular column in The Listener, published eight {{days after the}} film's release, Bennett explained how he felt horror films should always be [...] "punctuated by belly laughs" [...] and attacked Reeves's completely humourless movie as [...] "the most persistently sadistic and morally rotten film I have seen. It was a degrading experience by which I mean {{it made me feel}} dirty." [...] Although Reeves was infuriated, his response indicated that he believed Bennett's reaction was proof that his decision to include such extreme violence was the correct approach to the material. In his letter published in The Listener, Reeves noted: [...] "Surely the most immoral thing in any form of entertainment is the conditioning of the audience to accept and enjoy violence... Violence is horrible, degrading and sordid. Insofar as one <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> it on the screen at all, it should be presented as such– and the more people it shocks into sickened recognition of these facts the better. I wish I could have witnessed Mr. Bennett frantically attempting to wash away the 'dirty' feeling my film gave him. It would have been proof of the fact that Witchfinder General works as intended." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{separate}} {{review in the}} St. Petersburg Times, Steve Persall did not view the film in high regard. [...] Persall noted that although Peter Alexander stated the film was a [...] "warning against the influence of religious cults," [...] and not based on Scientology specifically, he thought that [...] "The Profit is a rant against Hubbard and Scientology, {{no matter how many}} cults the filmmakers claim to have researched and incorporated into the story." [...] Persall expressed frustration when Alexander did not answer specific questions about his inspiration and influences used in the film, citing concerns that: [...] "the evil empire will jump all over whoever else <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> it next." [...] Though the review was not favorable, Persall wrote that the film would have been a more powerful piece as a truthful documentary, and not a parody, writing: [...] "The Profit would make a stronger statement if Alexander used his Scientology experience to produce a documentary or a no-holds-barred version of Hubbard's life that calls him Hubbard." ...|$|E

The performance closed with making the bird angry, and seeing him cling to a handkerchief upside down, pecking and [...] "clucking," [...] as Rob called it. He was allowed to fly after that, and settled himself on the bunch of pine-cones over the door, where he sat {{staring down at the}} company with an air of sleepy dignity that amused them very much.|$|E

60|$|But I {{think there}} is a limit, and a highly {{legitimate}} limit, to this process. I think a man may praise Pindar without knowing the top of a Greek letter from the bottom. But I think that if a man is going to abuse Pindar, if he is going to denounce, refute, and utterly expose Pindar, if he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> Pindar up as the utter ignoramus and outrageous impostor that he is, then I think it will be just as well perhaps--I think, at any rate, it would do no harm--if he did know a little Greek, and even had read a little Pindar. And I think the same situation would be involved if the critic were concerned to point out that Pindar was scandalously immoral, pestilently cynical, or low and beastly in his views of life. When people brought such attacks against the morality of Pindar, I should regret that they could not read Greek; and when they bring such attacks against the morality of Fielding, I regret very much that they cannot read English.|$|E
60|$|Put {{into the}} plainest of prose, then, {{we are saying}} that the {{government}} of every country ought to supply work and pay for the unemployed, maintenance for the infirm and aged, and education and opportunity for the children. These are vast tasks. And they involve, of course, a financial burden not dreamed of before the war. But here again the war has taught us many things. It would have seemed inconceivable before, that a man of great wealth should give one-half of his income to the state. The financial burden of the war, as the full measure of it dawned upon our minds, seemed to betoken a universal bankruptcy. But the sequel <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that the finance of the war will prove to be a lesson in the finance of peace. The new burden has come to stay. No modern state can hope to survive unless it meets the kind of social claims {{on the part of the}} unemployed, the destitute and the children that have been described above. And it cannot do this unless it continues to use the terrific engine of taxation already fashioned in the war. Undoubtedly the progressive income tax and the tax on profits and taxation of inheritance must be maintained to an extent never dreamed of before.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Thornbury had {{received}} a great many letters. She was completely engrossed in them. When she had finished a page she {{handed it to her}} husband, or gave him the sense of what she was reading in a series of short quotations linked together by a sound {{at the back of her}} throat. [...] "Evie writes that George has gone to Glasgow. 'He finds Mr. Chadbourne so nice to work with, and we hope to spend Christmas together, but I should not like to move Betty and Alfred any great distance (no, quite right), though it is difficult to imagine cold weather in this heat. [...] . Eleanor and Roger drove over in the new trap. [...] . Eleanor certainly looked more like herself than I've seen her since the winter. She has put Baby on three bottles now, which I'm sure is wise (I'm sure it is too), and so gets better nights. [...] . My hair still falls out. I find it on the pillow! But I am cheered by hearing from Tottie Hall Green. [...] . Muriel is in Torquay enjoying herself greatly at dances. She <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> her black put after all.' [...] . A line from Herbert--so busy, poor fellow! Ah! Margaret says, 'Poor old Mrs. Fairbank died on the eighth, quite suddenly in the conservatory, only a maid in the house, who hadn't the presence of mind to lift her up, which they think might have saved her, but the doctor says it might have come at any moment, and one can only feel thankful that it was in the house and not in the street (I should think so!). The pigeons have increased terribly, just as the rabbits did five years ago [...] .'" [...] While she read her husband kept nodding his head very slightly, but very steadily in sign of approval.|$|E
6000|$|Shelley's {{feeling as}} to Keats's final volume of poems is further {{exhibited}} in the following extracts, (To Thomas Love Peacock, November, 1820.) 'Among the modern things which have reached me is a volume of poems by Keats; in other respects insignificant enough, but containing the fragment of a poem called Hyperion, I dare say you have not time to read it; {{but it is certainly}} an astonishing piece of writing, and gives me a conception of Keats which I confess I had not before.' (To Mrs. Leigh Hunt, 11 November, 1820.) 'Keats's new volume has arrived to us, and the fragment called Hyperion promises for him that he is destined {{to become one of the}} first writers of the age. His other things are imperfect enough[9], and, what is worse, written in the bad sort of style which is becoming fashionable among those who fancy that they are imitating Hunt and Wordsworth.... Where is Keats now? I am anxiously expecting him in Italy, when I shall take care to bestow every possible attention on him. I consider his a most valuable life, and I am deeply interested in his safety. I intend to be the physician both of his body and his soul,--to keep the one warm, and to teach the other Greek and Spanish. I am aware indeed, in part, that I am nourishing a rival who will far surpass me; and this is an additional motive, and will be an added pleasure.' (To Peacock, 15 February, 1821.) 'Among your anathemas of the modern attempts in poetry do you include Keats's Hyperion? I think it very fine. His other poems are worth little; but, if the Hyperion be not grand poetry, none has been produced by our contemporaries.' There is also a phrase in a letter to Mr. Ollier, written on 14 May, 1820, before the actual publication of the Lamia volume: 'Keats, I hope, <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> himself a great poet; like the sun, to burst through the clouds which, though dyed in the finest colours of the air, obscured his rising.' ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{are plenty}} of {{difficulties}} in this immense task in England, and I {{am not sure that}} I will exclude Scotland, but I said England in order to save your feelings. One of the obstacles is the difficulty of finding out for certain what actually happens. Scare headlines in the bills of important journals are misleading. I am sure many of you must know the kind of mirror that distorts features, elongates lines, makes round what is lineal, and so forth. I assure you that a mirror of that kind does not give you a more grotesque reproduction of the human physiognomy, than some of these tremendous telegrams give you as to what is happening in India. Another point is that the Press is very often flooded with letters from Indians or ex-Indians--from Indicus olim, and others--too oftened coloured with personal partisanship and deep-dyed prepossessions. There is a spirit of caste outside the Hindu sphere. There {{is a great deal of}} writing on the Indian Government by men who have acquired the habit while they were in the Government, and then unluckily retain the habit after they come home and live, or ought to live, in peace and quietness among their friends here. That is another of our difficulties. Still, when all such difficulties are measured and taken account of, it is impossible to overrate the courage, the patience and fidelity, with which the present House of Commons faces what is not at all an easy moment in Indian Government. You talk of democracy. People cry, [...] "Oh! Democracy cannot govern remote dependencies." [...] I do not know; it is a hard question. So far, after one Session of the most Liberal Parliament that has ever sat in Great Britain, this most democratic Parliament so far at all events, has safely rounded an extremely difficult angle. It is quite true that in reference to a certain Indian a Conservative member rashly called out one night in the House of Commons [...] "Why don't you shoot him?" [...] The whole House, Tories, Radicals, and Labour men, they all revolted against any such doctrine as that; and I augur from the proceedings of the last Session--with courage, patience, good sense, and willingness to learn, that democracy, in this case at all events, has shown, and I think <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show,</b> its capacity for facing all our problems.|$|E
