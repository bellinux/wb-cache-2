5000|$|Jun's origin is unclear. It {{is thought}} to have {{originated}} in northern China and Tibet; many brewers and distributors claim stock originating from imported heirloom Chinese or Tibetan jun cultures and/or openly confess stock to have originated from contraband. According to food writer Sandor Katz, [...] "The lack of credible information on the history of Jun leads me to the conclusion that it is a relatively recent divergence from the kombucha family tree. Some websites claim that it comes from Tibet, where it has been made for 1000 years; unfortunately, books on Tibetan food, and even a specialized book on Himalayan ferments, contain no mention of it... The culture is somewhat obscure and hard to find, but its epicenter seems to be the Pacific Northwest, where the Eugene, Oregon-based Herbal Junction Elixirs produces it commercially." [...] Despite Katz's profession of a paucity of evidence for Jun's history, the oldest Tibetan tradition, the Bon, still today cultivate it.Katz's conjecture is also contravened by Chris Straight's observation that a refined ingredient like cane sugar, unavailable in the distant past of Jun's ostensible origin, couldn't plausibly be the original ferment's recipe, whereas raw honey is—as has it ever been—ready to use straight from the hive. Straight does note that today's commercially produced raw honey if unstrained has the potential to introduce contaminants such as bee parts but given honey's strong antiseptic properties notes his years of experience have never yet yielded a compromised batch (reputable suppliers of still raw but <b>filtered</b> <b>honey</b> are readily available for generally an only slight price premium over unfiltered raw sources).|$|E
40|$|International audienceAccording to {{both the}} European Council's Honey Directive 2001 / 110 /EC and the present Codex Aliminerius Honey Standard, {{filtration}} of honey is permitted. After this filtration process, the microscopic determination of the botanical and geographical origin of honeys {{is no longer possible}} since all the pollen has been removed. In many honey countries, there is a considerable difference in the price of honey depending on the botanical and geographical origin. There is the risk of fraud if expensive unfiltered honey is mixed with cheap <b>filtered</b> <b>honey.</b> In this research project, a method was developed that allows the detection of mixtures of filtered and unfiltered honey. Comparative tests showed that enzyme activities, mainly sucrase, were influenced by this process. The protein content did not decrease. Sucrase was isolated by gel chromatography and analysed by gel electrophoresis. One of the two dominating protein bands with 40 kDa and 65 kDa decreased significantly after filtration, which led to a shift in the natural ratio between them. The quantitative densitometric analysis of these two protein bands allows the detection of 15 % added <b>filtered</b> <b>honey...</b>|$|E

Turkey is second honey producer after China in World and is the first order at the honey production in Europe. In this research, some physicochemical properties of honey produced in Iğdır and region (Kağızman, Tuzluca, Aralık) were investigated. In research 30 <b>filtering</b> flower <b>honey</b> were used.

40|$|In the {{veterinary}} medicine the tetracyclines {{belong to the}} most often used animal antibiotics. Indeed, her use is not permitted {{in the area of}} the beekeeping to the honey production in Germany. In other countries, particular in North America and Central America, tetracyclines are frequently used, even to the preventive treatment against American foulbrood. The knowledge of occurred residues and possible appearing metabolites is as necessary as an existing powerful method for analysing tetracyclines in honey. A market survey of 359 honey of different origin was examined for residues of tetracyclines with ELISA and Charm II. All honeys from Germany are free of tetracyclines, 5 % of the European honey are positive and 24 % of all honeys with American origin were giving positive results. In a medication study several colonies of bees were treated with oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline. The honey produced by these colonies of bees was tested by ELISA, CHARM II, HPLC with solid-phase extraction and by HPLC in a commercial lab specified on honey analytics. The further used method which had been already applied successfully for analysing tetracyclines in eggs by dialysis preparation was not suitable, so the official method of the German food and commodities law was used. The colonies not treated with tetracyclines showed no residues of tetracyclines, so cross-contamination by drifting and robbery was not observed. The concentrations of chlortetracycline estimated with several techniques are matching each other and the amount of epi-chlortetracyline is similar to an additional analysed long time stored spiked honey. The honey of the colonies which had been treated with oxytetracycline no residues were more provable with the HPLC methods, while the immune-chemical methods still indicated the presence of tetracyclines, partially near the detection limit. It could be assumed that the immunochemical methods are able to detect tetracyclines, even if they are modified, because the binding-site is able to bind to a specific and not affected part of the molecule, while the sample preparation for the HPLC causes losses of chemical modified tetracyclines. The effect was also observed with a honey spiked with oxytetracycline and a spiked mixture of fructose and glucose, but not with a solution of oxytetracycline in water. With chlortetracycline no loss was determined. That entails that positive results of the frequently used screening tests showing residues of tetracyclines not confirmed by HPLC, meaning false-positive results are only indicating the further presence of oxytetracycline and unauthorised application could be possible. Additional, a simplification of the complicated sample preparation for the official method of the German food and commodities law was developed. The sequence of two solid-phase-extractions with the steps preparation, application of the probe, cleaning, eluting was carried out by an automatic sampling system, which is directly coupled with the HPLC-system. The manual steps are restricted to dissolving and <b>filtering</b> of the <b>honey.</b> This system works reliably, but the long time stability of this high complex technical apparatus is not sufficient...|$|R
40|$|Medicinal use {{of honey}} has re-emerged {{recently}} indicating that honey accelerates wound healing activity. Honey {{has been shown}} to stimulate TNF-α production from monocytes and macrophages which is apparently correlated with a high molecular weight fraction, and not lipopolysaccharide (LPS, an immunostimulatory endotoxin) levels. Cytokine production by honey has been attributed to the endotoxin content. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the ability of Comvita sourced honeys to elicit a TNF-α cytokine response from acute monocytic leukemia (THP- 1) cells as well as identify the responsible component. Five honey samples were used together with sugar and methylglyoxal controls. The samples were incubated with THP- 1 cells, with and without LPS. After incubation, the cell culture supernatants were collected and TNF-α was measured by the enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA). The most active honey samples were further heat-treated to remove enzyme/protein/peptide-like stimulation; the samples were treated with polymixin [i. e. polymyxin] B (PmB) to remove LPS-like stimulation and not protein fraction. The samples were then filtered by molecular weight centrifugal filters to separate constituents according to their size and the fractions were re-analysed. All five honey samples in the absence of LPS stimulated TNF-α release from THP- 1 cells, whereas untreated, sugar- and methylglyoxal-treated cells did not. The cytokine production was partially inhibited by heating, but mostly by PmB. In the <b>filtered</b> <b>honey</b> samples, the activity was observed in the > 30 kDa fraction. These results suggest that the activity may be associated with one or more components which are partially heat-labile, LPS-like stimulated with a high molecular weight. Further, honey samples were analyzed for the concentration of LPS present. The tests revealed that the cytokine stimulation was higher than would be expected from the concentration of LPS present in the honey. The possibility that this component was a plant-derived ß-glucan, which is known to have LPS-like activity and can interfere with detection of LPS in the LAL assay, was investigated. Subsequent analyses confirmed the presence of arabinogalactan, a large complex carbohydrate. The data presented in this study suggests that arabinogalactans in honey may stimulate inflammatory responses and the release of cytokines that are crucial in regulating wound- healing. This heralds a significant advancement in the usage and understanding of medicinal honey...|$|E
