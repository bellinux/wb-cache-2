40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} an initial simulation {{study of the}} propagation of Partial discharge (PD) Acoustic Emission (AE) signals from high voltage equipment. The paper helps to investigate the propagation behaviour of the AE waves at the interface of two different media namely oil and steel. Reflection, refraction and scattering of the PD shock waves are simulated and displayed. The initial {{results show that the}} signals as expected can alter significantly based on the properties of the oil and the steel. The Partial Differential Equations (PDE) describing the signals have been solved using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Through studying the theoretical aspects of PD AE signals, researchers and practitioners will better understand the properties and characteristic of PD experimental and practical high voltage <b>equipment</b> <b>signatures</b> e. g. power transformers...|$|R

50|$|Ted Kord was a genius-level {{inventor}} and {{a gifted}} athlete, sharing {{much more in}} common with the Fox original than did Charlton's earlier reimagining of the character. Kord's <b>signature</b> <b>equipment</b> was his bug-shaped personal aircraft, which he entered and exited typically with a cable suspended from the cockpit. He also generally eschewed personal weaponry, except for a pistol that made a blinding flash of light and, additionally, a strong airblast to gain the advantage when he closed in for hand-to-hand combat.|$|R
500|$|Box Car Racer was {{recorded}} over six weeks beginning in December 2001, primarily at Signature Sound in San Diego, California. Sessions commenced quickly, with producer Jerry Finn having sent one whole load of <b>equipment</b> to <b>Signature</b> {{ahead of his}} arrival. Barker and DeLonge worked out [...] "80 percent" [...] of the completed album in Barker's warehouse in Corona, California, two weeks prior to recording. When the musicians entered the studio, little was changed aside from certain lyrics, according to assistant engineer Sam Boukas. Barker completed his drum tracks in one day at two recording facilities in Los Angeles prior to the Signature sessions. DeLonge invited musician David Kennedy, whom he had met in the San Diego music circuit some years prior, to perform lead guitar parts on the album. Roger Joseph Manning Jr. plays keyboards on the record.|$|R

To determine the contribution of these electrical equipments to the total {{energy consumption}} is difficult and may require kWh meter to be installed in each of them. This paper presents Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) method to trace energy consumption of different electrical equipment by using the harmonics current originated from the <b>equipments</b> as their <b>signature.</b> The potential and feasibility of the method is tested through laboratory experiment. Three different set of electrical equipments being used i. e. Personal Computer (PC), fluorescent lamp (T 5 type) and compact fluorescent lamp (CFL).

2500|$|Since 1997, Slash has {{collaborated with}} Gibson on fifteen {{signature}} Les Paul modelsfive through Gibson USA; six through the Gibson Custom Shop; and four through the Gibson subsidiary Epiphone. He has also collaborated on <b>signature</b> <b>equipment</b> with other companies. In 1996, Marshall introduced the Marshall Slash Signature JCM2555, an authentic reissue of the Marshall [...] "Silver Jubilee" [...] JCM2555 released in 1987. It {{was the first}} signature amp ever produced by Marshall, with production limited to 3000. In 2007, Jim Dunlop introduced the Crybaby SW-95 Slash Signature Wah, designed after Slash's own custom-built Crybaby wah pedal. In 2010, Seymour Duncan introduced the Alnico II Pro Slash APH-2 pickups, which were designed to recreate the tone of Slash's main studio guitar. Also in 2010, Marshall introduced the Marshall AFD100, a recreation of the Marshall 1959 that Slash used for the recording of Appetite for Destruction, with production limited to 2300.|$|R

According to journalist Joe Shooman, while Box Car Racer was [...] "essentially an outlet for DeLonge's more esoteric leanings, it very quickly became obvious that this was an album destined for release," [...] largely due to Blink-182’s explosive popularity at the time. [...] "Any musical project with which any member was involved was very likely to fly off the shelves." [...] "I don’t think there was ever a doubt it was gonna be released — you have a project with two members of Blink-182 on it, it’s pretty hard not to turn a profit on that," [...] said engineer Sam Boukas. [...] "I guess if the record company wasn’t going to foot the bill, they were quite prepared to foot it themselves for Box Car Racer." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the legislation, doctrinal {{opinions}} and relevant case law regarding the validity of contracts concluded by electronic means (e-contracts) in Romania and to contribute to the current stage of knowledge in this matter. The objectives pursued by the author are: - identification of the peculiarities of the transposition of the E-Commerce Directive into Romanian legislation; - identification of problems that could arise from law’s interpretation; - analyzing the relevant case-law in this matter; - issuing of the de lege ferenda proposals. According to Romanian Law, an e-contract has the same effects as a contract concluded by traditional means, if the conditions of validity imposed by law have been observed. In Romanian legislation, the document in electronic form, to whom was incorporated, attached or logically associated an advanced electronic signature based on a qualified certificate not suspended or not revoked at that time and which was generated with the aid of a secure <b>equipment</b> of electronic <b>signature</b> creation is equated in terms of conditions and effects to a document under private signature...|$|R
5000|$|Many jobs in Payday 2 can be {{completed}} in stealth. If players avoid getting caught on camera, evade or silently kill security guards, and keep any civilian witnesses from calling the police, the alarm will not be raised and the players will receive an experience bonus. Otherwise, players will have to achieve their objectives, carry out any loot they find to a dropoff point, and then reach their escape point {{under the pressure of}} constant police assault waves. Most of the enemies are SWAT units sourced from DC Police, then FBI SWAT, GenSec private security contractors and finally the DHS as difficulty increases. Mixed in with these are special units; all versions of Payday 2 include the [...] "Shield" [...] and the [...] "Taser" [...] - both named for their <b>signature</b> <b>equipment,</b> the [...] "Bulldozer" [...] - a SWAT team member in a modified near-bulletproof bomb suit, and snipers. The Crimewave Edition and PC version include the [...] "Cloaker" [...] - an infiltration and hand-to-hand combat expert. Exclusive to the PC and Crimewave editions are near-indestructible SWAT van turrets, capable of area denial, a medic capable of returning an enforcer to full health with no status effects, and Captain Winters, a well-protected veteran police officer who sustains assaults and buffs enemies until he can be driven off.|$|R
50|$|In {{accordance}} with this view, post-Flixborough (and {{without waiting for}} the Inquiry Report), ICI Petrochemicals instituted a review of how it controlled modifications. It found that major projects requiring financial sanction {{at a high level}} were generally well-controlled, but for more (financially) minor modifications there was less control and this had resulted in a past history of 'near-misses' and small-scale accidents, few of which could be blamed on chemical engineers. To remedy this, not only were employees reminded of the principal points to consider when making a modification (both on the quality/compliance of the modification itself and on the effect of the modification {{on the rest of the}} plant), but new procedures and documentation were introduced to ensure adequate scrutiny. These requirements applied not only to changes to equipment, but also to process changes. All modifications were to be supported by a formal safety assessment. For major modifications this would include an 'operability study'; for minor modifications a checklist-based safety assessment was to be used, indicating what aspects would be affected, and for each aspect giving a statement of the expected effect. The modification and its supporting safety assessment then had to be approved in writing by the plant manager and engineer. Where instruments or electrical <b>equipment</b> were involved <b>signatures</b> would also be needed from the relative specialist (instrument manager or electrical engineer). A Pipework Code of Practice was introduced specifying standards of design construction and maintenance for pipework - all pipework over 3"nb (DN 75 mm) handling hazardous material would have to be designed by pipework specialists in the design office.The approach was publicised outside ICI; while the Pipework Code of Practice on its own would have combatted the specific fault(s) that led to the Flixborough disaster, the adoption more generally of tighter controls on modifications (and the method by which this was done) were soon recognised to be prudent good practice. In the United Kingdom, the ICI approach became a de facto standard for high-risk plant (partly because the new (1974) Health and Safety at Work Act went beyond specific requirements on employers to state general duties to keep risks to workers as low as reasonably practicable and to avoid risk to the public so far as reasonably practicable; under this new regime the presumption was that recognised good practice would inherently be 'reasonably practicable' and hence should be adopted, partly because key passages in reports of the Advisory Committee on Major Hazards were clearly supportive).|$|R
