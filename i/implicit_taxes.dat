Specifically, using futures market data to control for risk, we test whether the pre-tax returns on bonds are higher than the pre-tax returns on four stock indices during the period 1993 - 1999. We compare the risk-free stock index returns (on perfectly hedged portfolios) to risk-free returns on taxable bonds, and estimate <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> on equity. We find a moderate but significantly positive implicit tax for each stock index. Moreover, we find that cross-sectionally, <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> are much larger for the lowdividend NASDAQ 100 than for the other three, substantially higher dividend-yielding indices.

In this paper we use conventional tools of applied public finance to examine the <b>implicit</b> <b>tax</b> levied by lottery agencies through this fourth function. We examine the incidence of the <b>implicit</b> lottery <b>tax,</b> focusing on the dominant lottery games used in the 1980 s.

We then consider whether the <b>implicit</b> <b>tax</b> rate on lotteries is too high, comparing that rate to excise tax rates on alcohol and tobacco. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} {{on the existence of}} <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> in the corporate sector. With this finding, it provides support for the offsetting nature of explicit versus <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes.</b> Governments continuously provide tax preferences (tax incentives) to firms to induce these firms to alter their investment, production and financing decisions to reallocate resources towards outcomes that the government prefers. Tax preferences lead to lower explicit tax rates for firms that make use of these preferences. However (see Scholes and Wolfson (1992) and Wilkie (1992)), economic theory suggests that in equilibrium all firms must earn the same after-tax return (e. g. ROE). Hence high (low) <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> (tax preference induced adjustments of pre-tax returns) can be expected for firms with low (high) explicit taxes. This paper uses financial statements of 123 listed firms for six years (1991 - 1996) to provide empirical {{evidence on the}} existence of <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> in the corporate sector in the Netherlands. The paper finds that the inverse relation between implicit and explicit taxes exists, but is not a strong as expected, suggesting market frictions that prevent the equalisation of after-tax returns. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper takes a {{new look}} at the {{cross-border}} dividend-stripping transactions that gave rise to the Fifth Circuit’s opinion in Compaq v. Commissioner and the Eighth Circuit’s opinion in IES Industries v. Commissioner. In both cases, the circuit courts held for the taxpayers and rejected the Commissioner’s claim that the transactions lacked economic substance because the taxpayers were sure to lose money on the transactions before taxes. These cases generated extensive commentary that was split into two diametrically opposed camps. One group argued that the decisions were correct because the transactions were economically profitable business transactions. The other group argued that the transactions were blatant, abusive tax shelters; and that the courts should have struck them down. Because the commentators in the second group conceded that the transactions generated a pre-tax profit, these commentators also offered a range of proposals to modify or replace the pre-tax profit test. Although the tax benefit of crossborder dividend-stripping was sharply reduced by subsequent Congressional enactments, that action hid rather than resolved the issue whether the tax shelter jurisprudence is fundamentally flawed because there is a class of abusive transactions that produce a guaranteed profit before tax, but do not run afoul of the anti-abuse provisions in the tax law. This paper argues that the Compaq and IES Industries transactions do not reveal any fundamental failings with either anti-abuse jurisprudence generally or the pre-tax profit test in particular. This paper demonstrates that the circuit courts reached the wrong conclusions in those cases because the parties, the courts, and the commentators all ignored <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes.</b> That is not surprising because the <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> in these cases were difficult to see. These taxes were negative <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes,</b> which drove down the cum dividend price of the stripped stock, and therefore made the transactions appear profitable before taxes. However, once <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> are taken into account, the transactions in those cases are properly understood to be unprofitable before taxes. Finally, nearly ten years ago, Charlotte Crane observed that tax doctrine has all but ignored <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> and she challenged commentators, lawyers and judges to think carefully about how <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> can be incorporated into tax doctrine. My proposal to calculate pre-tax profit for the purpose of anti-abuse jurisprudence before both implicit and explicit taxes is, I believe, the first proposal to explicitly recognize <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> in tax doctrine...|$|E

We use the method introduced by Bertrand and Schoar (2003) to identify executives that have a significant influence on their company’s tax policy. Afterwards, we focus on this group of executives that have a significant influence on their company’s tax policy and relate them to four measures of <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> introduced by Jennings et al.

40|$|During {{the recent}} flat tax debate, {{interest}} rates on long-term municipal bonds rose relative to the rate on U. S. Treasury bonds. This was widely attributed to expectations of a reduction in future tax rates. While an axiom of finance states that current asset prices reflect expectations about future events, {{there is no consensus}} on how sensitive municipal bond yields are to expectations about future tax rates. This study assesses that question by examining the relationship between the <b>implicit</b> <b>tax</b> rate and actual future tax rates. > Efficient markets theory predicts that the <b>implicit</b> <b>tax</b> rate [...] the tax rate that equates the after-tax yield on a Treasury bond to the yield on a tax-exempt bond [...] will be an excellent predictor of future tax rates. The author finds that although the Efficient Markets prediction is not supported, <b>implicit</b> <b>tax</b> rates do contain some information about future tax rates. The information content in <b>implicit</b> <b>tax</b> rates is particularly high around the time of major tax debates that have resulted in significant changes in tax rates.

While the legislation was developed to better target Medicare services to individuals without access to employer-sponsored insurance, MSP creates a significant <b>implicit</b> <b>tax</b> on working beyond age 65.

40|$|Tax sparing {{occurs when}} {{a country with a}} {{worldwide}} tax system grants its citizens foreign tax credits for the taxes that they would have paid on income earned abroad, but that escapes taxation by virtue of foreign tax incentives. The supporters of tax sparing argue that it is a form of foreign aid, an obligation owed to developing countries, and a legitimate means of improving the competitiveness of resident investors. Tax sparing, however, has long been opposed by the United States {{on the grounds that it}} is an expensive and problematic concession to developing countries, inconsistent with basic and fundamental tax principles, and an inappropriate mechanism for improving the competitiveness of resident investors. The U. S. position appears to be carrying the day as tax sparing has been on the wane. In contrast with the emerging consensus, I offer a new argument for tax sparing. Drawing on the literature on <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes,</b> I argue that tax incentives produce <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes.</b> From the perspective of the investor, <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> are as real as traditional explicit taxes. Thus, tax sparing is best viewed as extending the foreign tax credit to include <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes.</b> Accordingly, I argue that tax sparing is consistent with the notion of a single level of taxation and the foreign tax credit. I also argue that tax sparing is necessary to prevent domestic investors from being disadvantaged by foreign tax incentives. In addition, I show that such arguments support a greatly expanded form of tax sparing. Finally, I demonstrate that the tax sparing credit, as currently calculated, will usually exceed the implicit tax paid and propose an alternative method of calculating the credit that will place investors residing in countries with worldwide tax systems on par with other investors...|$|E

This paper examines Callihan and White’s empirically-driven definition of implicit tax rates and points to the pitfalls of using this definition for firms that may possess market power. In particular, it is shown that, since the Callihan and White measure assumes that firms do in fact operate in perfectly competitive markets, it cannot validly be used to measure the magnitude of <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> in the presence of firm market power. Additionally, doubt is cast over the validity of Callihan and White’s finding that <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> are lower for firms possessing market power...|$|E

While the results suggest that greater use of after-tax measures in CEO compensation leads to higher tax savings, it is possible that these savings will lead to lower pre-tax returns, or <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes.</b> Therefore, I also examine {{the association between}} the use of after-tax incentives and <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> and find a positive association between the two. Finally, I find a significant positive relation between after-tax incentives and total CEO compensation, suggesting that CEOs who are compensated after-tax demand a premium for the additional risk they bear...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper has been to {{quantify}} and discuss the implications of <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> in Pakistan's agriculture. The methodology of the paper consisted of defining the import and export parity prices of major agricultural commodities grown in Pakistan, by comparing them with domestic procurement prices. Although the analysis covered only four commodities, implicit tax rates in some of the years from 1970 - 71 to 1989 - 90 were as high as 75 percent for certain commodities. It was only in the case of IRRI rice and sugarcane that domestic prices were above the world levels in some years of the period under consideration. When shown {{as a percentage of the}} value-added by agriculture, the taxes on these four commodities, net of the total budgetary subsidies on agricultural inputs, varied from 1. 9 percent to 14. 9 percent. These tax rates in agriculture compared favourably with the overall tax rates in Pakistan's economy for most of the years. Judged in the light of the relative taxable capacities of agriculture and Pakistan's economy as a whole, <b>implicit</b> <b>taxes</b> were much higher in agriculture than in the other sectors of the economy. ...|$|E

Medicaid's crowd-out effect stems from the large <b>implicit</b> <b>tax</b> (about 60 - 75 percent for a median-wealth individual) that Medicaid imposes on private insurance.
