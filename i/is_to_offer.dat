25|$|Serbian cuisine {{is largely}} heterogeneous, with heavy Oriental, Central European and Mediterranean influences. Despite this, it has evolved and {{achieved}} its own culinary identity. Food {{is very important}} in Serbian social life, particularly during religious holidays such as Christmas, Easter and feast days, i.e., slava. Staples of the Serbian diet include bread, meat, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. Traditionally, three meals are consumed per day. Breakfast generally consists of eggs, meat and bread. Lunch is considered the main meal, and is normally eaten in the afternoon. Traditionally, Turkish coffee is prepared after a meal, and is served in small cups. Bread is the basis of all Serbian meals, and it {{plays an important role in}} Serbian cuisine and can be found in religious rituals. A traditional Serbian welcome <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> bread and salt to guests, and also slatko (fruit preserve). Meat is widely consumed, as is fish. Serbian specialties include kajmak (a dairy product similar to clotted cream), proja (cornbread), kačamak (corn-flour porridge), and gibanica (cheese and kajmak pie). Ćevapčići, caseless grilled and seasoned sausages made of minced meat, is the national dish of Serbia.|$|E
