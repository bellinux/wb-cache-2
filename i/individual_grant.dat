50|$|During this time, Moore {{was also}} working {{on a series of}} {{photographs}} of grain elevators in Buffalo, New York with the assistance of a NYSCA <b>individual</b> <b>grant.</b> In Buffalo, Moore met a group of artists working with appropriated imagery, which inspired him to begin using mechanical and chemical processes to incorporate multiple negatives, paintings, drawings, and xeroxes into complex montage images outside of strict documentary practice. This method of recombination, in the era before Photoshop, created images of “convulsive beauty” and were the subject of Moore’s first solo exhibition in New York at Lieberman and Saul Gallery in 1986, following his first solo show at Real Art Ways in Hartford, CT in 1985.|$|E

5000|$|The {{personal}} name Gillanders is an Anglicised {{form of a}} Gaelic name meaning [...] "the servant of (St) Andrew". The Gaelic name was a common one in mediaeval Scotland. According to Grant, there are two men who appear in contemporary records in the 13th century, that may belong to the clan. These men are Gillanders MacIsaac, and Isaac MacGillanders, who {{are thought to be}} father and son. According to Grant, since Gillanders MacIsaac flourished in about 1231, this could make him a contemporary of the Gillanders recorded in the manuscript, and possibly could mean they are the same <b>individual.</b> <b>Grant</b> suggested that the lands of Gillanders MacIsaac may have been on the Black Isle, or lower Strathconon, or around Dingwall.|$|E
