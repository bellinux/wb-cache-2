5|$|Typhoon Gay, {{also known}} as the Kavali Cyclone of 1989, was a small but {{powerful}} tropical cyclone that caused more than 800fatalities in and around the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thailand</b> in November 1989. The worst typhoon to affect the Malay Peninsula in 35years, Gay originated from a monsoon trough over the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thailand</b> in early-November. Owing to favorable atmospheric conditions, the storm rapidly intensified, attaining winds of more than 120km/h (75mph) by 3 November. Later that day, Gay became the first typhoon since 1891 to make landfall in Thailand, striking Chumphon Province with winds of 185km/h (115mph). The small storm emerged into the Bay of Bengal and gradually reorganized over the following days as it approached southeastern India. On 8 November, Gay attained its peak intensity as a Category5–equivalent cyclone with winds of 260km/h (160mph). The typhoon then moved ashore near Kavali, Andhra Pradesh. Rapid weakening ensued inland, and Gay dissipated over Maharashtra early on 10 November.|$|E

40|$|This study aims at {{examining}} wintertime (December-January-February; DJF) climatology and spatio-temporal variability <b>of</b> <b>Thailand’s</b> {{total and}} extreme rainfall during 1970 - 2012. Analysis {{showed that the}} area along the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thailand’s</b> eastern coast not only received much amount of rainfall but also underwent great extremes and variances during the northeast monsoon (NEM) winters. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis similarly revealed that the leading mode of each DJF total or extreme rainfall index was marked by maximum loadings concentrated at the stations located at the exposed area of the NEM flow. Correlation analysis indicated that the leading EOF mode of DJF total and extreme indices in Thailand tended to be higher (lower) than normal during strong (weak) East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM). On longer timescales, the recent decadal change observed in the leading EOF mode of all rainfall indices has been coincident with re-amplification of the EAWM taken place since the early/mid 2000. The leading EOF mode of DJF total and extreme rainfall indices in Thailand also exhibited strong correlations with the tropical-subtropical Pacific Ocean surface temperatures. It was characterized as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) /El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) -related boomerang-shaped spatial patterns, resembling the typical mature phases of the La Niña event and the PDO cool epoch. Based on our analysis, {{it is reasonable to}} believe that the anomalies of the NEM and other key EAWM-related circulations are likely to be the possible causes of DJF total and extreme rainfall variations in Thailand. In addition, the ENSO and PDO as the primary global atmospheric external forcing are likely to exert their influence on wintertime Thailand’s climate via modulating the EAWM/NEM-related circulations anomalies...|$|R

5|$|On November2, a {{tropical}} depression, later named Gay, {{developed in the}} <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thailand</b> and favorable atmospheric conditions allowed the system to undergo rapid intensification. By November3, Gay had intensified to a Category3-equivalent typhoon before striking Thailand. Crossing the Kra Isthmus in approximately six hours, the system emerged into the Bay of Bengal as a Category1-equivalent cyclone and assumed a west-northwesterly track towards India. For the next four days, the storm gradually reorganized before reaching a small area favorable for more significant intensification late on November6. Hours before making landfall in India, Gay attained its peak intensity as a Category5-equivalent cyclone with winds estimated at 260km/h (160mph). Additionally, the IMD estimated that the storm had three-minute sustained winds of 240km/h (145mph), classifying Gay as a modern-day Super Cyclonic Storm. The powerful storm soon made landfall near Kavali, India, in Andhra Pradesh before rapidly weakening onshore. The system eventually dissipated over Maharashtra on November10.|$|E

5|$|Strengthening {{faster than}} anticipated, Gay {{attained}} typhoon status early on 3 November. Later that day, the storm developed an eye before passing over the Seacrest, an oil drilling ship. On 4 November, Gay's winds increased to 185km/h (115mph), {{equivalent to a}} Category3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, before making landfall in Chumphon Province, Thailand, at 0600UTC. The Japan Meteorological Agency assessed that the storm had ten-minute sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) and a pressure of 960mbar (hPa; 28.35inHg). Crossing the Kra Isthmus, Gay weakened to minimal typhoon status as it entered the Bay of Bengal. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Gay was the first typhoon since 1891 to form in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thailand</b> and enter the Bay of Bengal. Responding to a ridge to its north, Gay maintained a west-northwestward to northwestward track {{for the next four}} days. The storm gradually restrengthened as it moved through an area of low wind shear and warm waters; however, this was limited by restrictions to the cyclone's outflow.

5|$|Although it {{organized}} into a tropical cyclone in the Andaman Sea, {{the origins of}} the 1999Odisha cyclone {{can be traced back to}} an area of convection that began developing in the Sulu Sea on October21. Despite some signs of development, wind shear suppressed outflow and prevented any significant organization. Tracking westward, the disturbance encountered a more favorable environment in the South China Sea; as a result, thunderstorm activity began to increase. Prompted by these changes, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) at 02:00UTC on 23October. However, the system failed to develop any further before wind shear reemerged in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thailand,</b> causing convection to diminish and resulting in the cancellation of the TCFA. On 24October, the storm crossed the Malay Peninsula and moved into the Andaman Sea by 03:00UTC the following day. Although the environment remained moderately unfavorable for tropical cyclogenesis, the disturbance organized, developing fair outflow, a strong rainband, and additional convection. At 06:00UTC on 25October, the system became a tropical depression while centered 550km (340mi) east of Port Blair. As such, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as BOB03. With the storm now steadily organizing, the JTWC once again issued a TCFA at 19:30UTC on 25October; early the following day, the IMD assessed that the nascent depression had strengthened into a cyclonic storm. At the time, the storm was located 325km (200mi) south-southeast of Rangoon, Myanmar.|$|E

40|$|Global {{demands for}} {{agricultural}} and forestry products provide economic incentives for deforestation across the tropics. Much of this deforestation occurs {{with a lack}} of information on the spatial distribution of benefits and costs of deforestation. To inform global sustainable land-use policies, we combine geographic information systems (GIS) with a meta-analysis of ecosystem services (ES) studies to perform a spatially explicit analysis of the trade-offs between agricultural benefits, carbon emissions, and losses of multiple ecosystem services because of tropical deforestation from 2000 to 2012. Even though the value of ecosystem services presents large inherent uncertainties, we find a pattern supporting the argument that the externalities of destroying tropical forests are greater than the current direct economic benefits derived from agriculture in all cases bar one: when yield and rent potentials of high-value crops could be realized in the future. Our analysis identifies the Atlantic Forest, areas around the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Guinea, and <b>Thailand</b> as areas where agricultural conversion appears economically efficient, indicating a major impediment to the long-term financial sustainability of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) schemes in those countries. By contrast, Latin America, insular Southeast Asia, and Madagascar present areas with low agricultural rents (ARs) and high values in carbon stocks and ES, suggesting that they are economically viable conservation targets.
