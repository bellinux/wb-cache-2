40|$|The {{effects of}} self-interaction in {{classical}} physics, {{in the presence}} of closed timelike curves, are probed by means of a simple model problem: The motion and self-collisions of a nonrelativistic, classical billiard ball in a space endowed with a wormhole that takes the ball backward in time. The central question asked is whether the Cauchy problem is well posed for this model problem, in the following sense: We define the multiplicity of an <b>initial</b> <b>trajectory</b> for the ball to be the number of self-consistent solutions of the ball’s equations of motion, which begin with that trajectory. For the Cauchy problem to be well posed, all <b>initial</b> <b>trajectories</b> must have multiplicity one. A simple analog of the science-fiction scenario of going back in time and killing oneself is an <b>initial</b> <b>trajectory</b> which is dangerous in this sense: When followed assuming no collisions, the trajectory takes the ball through the wormhole and thereby back in time, and then sends the ball into collision with itself. In contrast with one’s naive expectation that dangerous trajectories might have multiplicity zero and thereby make the Cauchy problem ill posed ("no solutions"), it is shown that all dangerous <b>initial</b> <b>trajectories</b> in a wide class have infinite multiplicity and thereby make the Cauchy problem ill posed in an unexpected way: "far too many solutions. " The wide class of infinite-multiplicity, dangerous trajectories includes all those that are nearly coplanar with the line of centers between the wormhole mouths, and a ball and wormhole restricted by (ball radius) ≪(wormhole radius) ≪(separation between wormhole mouths). Two of the infinity of solutions are slight perturbations of the self-inconsistent, collision-free motion, and all the others are strongly different from it. Not all <b>initial</b> <b>trajectories</b> have infinite multiplicity: trajectories where the ball is initially at rest far from the wormhole have multiplicity one, as also, probably, do those where it is almost at rest. A search is made for <b>initial</b> <b>trajectories</b> with zero multiplicity, and none are found. The search entails constructing a set of highly nonlinear, coupled, algebraic equations that embody all the ball’s laws of motion, collision, and wormhole traversal, and then constructing perturbation theory and numerical solutions of the equations. A future paper (paper II) will show that, when one takes account of the effects of quantum mechanics, the classically ill-posed Cauchy problem ("too many classical solutions") becomes quantum-mechanically well posed in the sense of producing unique probability distributions for the outcomes of all measurements...|$|R

40|$|SummaryRecent {{theories}} of limb control emphasize motor cortex as a dynamical system, with planning setting the initial neural state, and execution {{arising from the}} self-limiting evolution of the intrinsic neural dynamics. Therefore, movements that share an <b>initial</b> <b>trajectory</b> but then diverge might have different neural states during {{the execution of the}} identical <b>initial</b> <b>trajectories.</b> We hypothesized that motor adaptation maps neural states to changes in motor command. This predicts that two opposing perturbations, which interfere when experienced over the same movement, could be learned if each is associated with a different plan even if not executed. We show that planning, but not executing, different follow-through movements allow opposing perturbations to be learned simultaneously over the same movement. However, no learning occurs if different follow throughs are executed, but not planned prior to movement initiation. Our results suggest neural, rather than physical states, are the critical factor associated with motor adaptation...|$|R
40|$|Sex {{differences}} in humans on virtual water maze navigation are well established when overall performance is measured, e. g., {{by the total}} time taken to find the hidden platform, total path length, or quadrant dwell time during probe trials. Currently, it is unknown whether males are better spatial learners than females, or if overall performance differences reflect {{other aspects of the}} task unrelated to spatial memory. Here, males and females were tested on a virtual analogue of the Morris water maze. We devised a novel method of analysis in which each trial was divided into an <b>initial</b> <b>trajectory</b> phase and search phase. We also implemented a new measure of spatial learning during early and late training, by including trials in which subjects were only required to indicate where they thought the hidden target zone was located. Consistent with previous reports, males outperformed females on overall measures of task performance. Males also performed significantly better on all <b>initial</b> <b>trajectory</b> phase variables. Interestingly, only small (non-significant) differences were observed during the search phase and when spatial learning was tested without the constraints of a typical water maze trial. Our results suggest that spatial knowledge regarding the location of the hidden target zone is not the main factor responsible for overall sex {{differences in}} virtual water maze performance. Instead, the largest sex differences were observed during the <b>initial</b> <b>trajectory</b> phase of the trial, which is thought to depend on effective processing of distal features of the environment. status: publishe...|$|R

A Lipschitzian trajectory x(t), (t< 0), with continuous derivative, on which the velocities do not exceed some limiting velocity v<c, where c denotes the speed of light, is called an <b>initial</b> <b>trajectory.</b> A locally Lipschitzian trajectory y(t) is called relativistically admissible if the velocities on it stay below the speed of light c. The author constructs operators Φ_j of a trajectory whose values Φ_j(y) (t) are linear transformations of R^ 3 into R^ 3. A point t=t_ 1 on a trajectory y is called singular if either some of the charges collide at the time t_ 1 or the determinant is zero for {{at least one of the}} transformations Φ_j(y) (t_ 1). The main result is the following: If x(t) (t< 0) is an <b>initial</b> <b>trajectory</b> with nonsingular point t= 0, then there exists a unique relativistically admissible trajectory y(t), defined for t in an interval I⊂ < 0,∞), extending the <b>initial</b> <b>trajectory</b> x(t) and having the following properties.

(2) The trajectory represents a unique solution of the Newton-Einstein momentum-force system of equations under Lorentz forces induced by electromagnetic field in accord to Feynman's law for moving point charges. (3) The trajectory y represents the maximal global solution of the system. Comment: 3 page...|$|R

Our aim in this paper is the synthesis of realistic, controllable motion for lightweight natural objects in a gaseous medium.

Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is used during optimization to produce fluid simulations at a reasonable computational cost, while interesting vortex-based fluid motion is generated by recording the presence of vortices in the <b>initial</b> <b>trajectories</b> and maintaining them through optimization. Object rotations are refined as a postprocess to enhance the visual quality of the results.
