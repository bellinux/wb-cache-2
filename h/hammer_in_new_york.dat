5000|$|In 1965 Roberts {{decided to}} sell the house, {{purchase}} a caravan, {{and move to the}} Isle of Arran in Scotland. Privations of life in the wilderness and a desire for company eventually led to another return to Sussex and the purchase of a house in Rye, together with a return to part-time teaching. The availability for purchase of a dilapidated coastguard cottage allowed both a return to beachside living at Fairlight and an opportunity to pay off the mortgage, allowing Roberts to work full time as an artist. Interest in his works increased, with exhibitions in London and an increasing number of visitors to his home. Further exhibitions followed at the Armand <b>Hammer</b> galleries <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City.|$|R

At one point, British Intelligence believed Hammer Galleries was a front for Soviet Intelligence. The Hammer brothers had been in contact with Soviet authorities for a number of reasons, such as famine relief as well as when the Soviets sought a buyer for the treasures of the Hermitage Museum as a way to earn hard currency. Victor was responsible for acquisitions for Hammer Galleries, including the so-called Romanov Treasures and Fabergé eggs. In 1937, Time Magazine described Victor and Armand as [...] "Two of the most startling characters in the U.

5000|$|Clark has had {{multiple}} museum exhibitions of his work, {{most recently in}} an exhibition of more than forty paintings, “In the Presence of Sacred Light”, at LUMA (the Loyola University Museum of Art) in Chicago May - August 2015. From November 2012 through February 2013 at the Laguna Art Museum in California. Organized by museum curator Janet Blake, the exhibition, [...] "Timothy J.

50|$|This {{sculpture}} is {{the second}} largest Hammering Man on the planet. A taller version is in Frankfurt, Germany. My {{goal is to have}} several different Hammering Men placed around the world-all working simultaneously. Other big outdoor versions of this work are in Japan and Switzerland. In the U.S. there are <b>Hammering</b> Men sculptures <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> Minneapolis, Los Angeles and Washington D.C., among other places. It's a concept which helps to connect all of us together and also gives each specific Hammering Man site the potential for its own personal interpretations. The State of Washington is known for its aerospace, electronics, timber, fishing, agriculture, and gold mining industries-people working with their hands, or manual labor. Let this sculpture be a symbol for all the people of Seattle working with others on the planet to create a happier and more enlightened humanity.|$|R

[...] The album, later named Channel Pressure, was recorded in improvised sessions over the course of three months at the studio and the headquarters of the label Mexican Summer, with the tracks later spliced, sampled and reconstructed. The press release described the record as [...] "an imaginary soundtrack for the adventure of Joey Rogers, a kid who gets brainwashed by a gigantic television", and musically categorized it as a post-pop album with elements of glitch, krautrock, synthpop, ambient music and progressive-fusion. In February 2011, the duo changed their name to Ford & Lopatin, reportedly to preempt legal issues with the Interscope Records artist Game, and also announced that they had founded a sub-label of Mexican Summer, named Software. Channel Pressure was the first release on the label.|$|R
5000|$|Young {{had some}} local success selling to Dallas area {{collectors}} and buyers {{from the late}} 1960s to the early 1990s, including Waxahachie-based outsider art collectors, Bruce and Julie Webb, who were early supporters of Young’s work. In addition to being featured in exhibitions at Chapman Kelly Studio, Young’s work was also shown through the nineteen-nineties and early 2000’s at Mason Murer Fine Art Gallery in Atlanta, at Webb Gallery in Waxahachie, and at Carl <b>Hammer</b> Gallery <b>in</b> Chicago. <b>New</b> <b>York</b> gallery Ricco Maresca mounted Young’s first solo exhibition in 1993, which was followed by another solo show in 1994 at the Goldie Paley Gallery at Moore College of Art and Design.

In 2009 his work {{was the subject of a}} retrospective curated by Edleeca Thompson at the African American Museum on Dallas, and in 2015 Young’s work was included in “Inside the Outside: Five Self-Taught Artists from the William Louis-Dreyfus Foundation” at the Katonah Museum of Art, an exhibition which will travel to both the Weatherspoon Museum in Greensboro and the Baker Museum in Naples. Sarah Gold, reviewing the “Inside the Outside Exhibition for the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Times, wrote of Young’s work: “His untitled pieces feature enigmatic objects — unrecognizable, but executed as carefully as medical illustrations — suspended in negative space, and all of them share a certain sort of clinical, sci-fi aspect. One drawing, of a segmented, horn-shaped form, might be a piece of armor worn by a futuristic warrior; another long-stemmed, geometric structure might be a space station on a distant planet. Still other shapes, bearing long articulated tendrils, suggest protozoan life-forms seen under a microscope.” ...|$|R
