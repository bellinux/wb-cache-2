40|$|The {{description}} {{relates to}} a process and a device or a tool for the fully automatic assembly of hose locking devices, in particular worm <b>drive</b> <b>hose</b> clips which are attached by a screw connection to lock a hose to a solid or hollow body such as a pipe socket or similar. The invention {{is characterized by the}} fact that an open, unscrewed hose locking device is bent at its point of fixture about the hose in a bending and shaping operation, the tip of the hose locking device is introduced into its lock, and the screw thread in the lock is tightened to secure the hose locking device. The assembly process or the corresponding tool are particularly suitable for a fully automated assembly of hose locking devices by means of an industrial robot, whereby hose assembly on the connecting sockets is fully separated from the following assembly of the hose locking device...|$|E
50|$|A Hose Reel is a {{cylindrical}} spindle made {{of either}} metal, fiberglass, or plastic {{and is used}} for storing a hose. The most common styles of hose reels are spring driven (which is self retracting), hand crank, or motor <b>driven.</b> <b>Hose</b> reels are categorized by the diameter and length of the hose they hold, the pressure rating and the rewind method. Hose reels can either be fixed in a permanent location, or portable and attached to a truck, trailer, or cart.|$|R
50|$|Edouard seemed {{destined for}} a career as an artist, but around 1888 {{he and his brother}} Andre {{returned}} to Clermont-Ferrand {{in order to try to}} save the failing family business, then a manufacturer of agricultural tools, <b>drive</b> belts and <b>hoses.</b> In 1889, he improved greatly on the design of the pneumatic tyre for bicycles, making tyres easier to change and repair. The invention proved its worth in the Paris-Brest cycle event organized by the newspaper Le Petit Journal in September 1891, and Michelin quickly adapted his inflatable tyres for use on motor vehicles, of which France was becoming the world's leading producer. Success came rapidly, and already in 1896 approximately 300 Paris taxis were running on Michelin pneumatic tyres. His company went on to experience tremendous growth serving the fledgling industry around the turn of the century and beyond.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine a}} {{competition}} between the whistler and Alfven fire <b>hoses</b> <b>driven</b> by bi-Maxwellian protons with p# > T p#, where p# and p# are proton temperatures, parallel and perpendicular to the background magnetic field, respectively. We extend the work of Hellinger and Matsumoto [2000] using a two-dimensional hybrid simulation that includes both the instabilities. In the simulation the whistler fire hose initially dominates and saturates in a quasi-linear manner. The Alfven fire hose is not strongly affected {{by the presence of}} the whistler fire hose and grows even when the former is saturated. However, as the Alfven fire hose grows and saturates via a conversion to Alfven waves that heat the protons, the waves driven by the whistler fire hose get strongly damped and disappear. The Alfven waves damp as well, so {{that at the end of}} the simulation the wave activity is low. The strong decay of the generated waves translates to an important decrease of the proton temperature anisotropy...|$|R
40|$|The {{urgency of}} {{developing}} space systems with hose pneumatic actuators. It is shown that an effective method of data research is mathematical modeling. An {{analysis of the}} literature substantiates the direction {{of research in the}} development of a mathematical model in the form of partial dynamic chain of spherical motion. The features developed spatial system <b>drives</b> with a <b>hose</b> pneumatic actuator. Based on the proposed dynamic model composed of a system of differential equations of motion of individual spherical partial subsystems. The structural and mathematical model calculations of the pole moving platform. Calculations are performed for different initial conditions and different loading schemes. It is shown that the formulation of emphasis on having cyclic ring moving platform. This trajectory has nested loops, which are caused by difference frequency partial subsystems platform and rod. The analysis of staging systems for emphasis. It is shown that the trajectory of the moving platform pole in this case is within the pole, which has a loop-shaped character. Cycle spherical moving platforms are within the specified bandwidth. ?????????? ???????????? ?????????? ???????????????? ?????? ???????? ? ?????????? ?????????????????. ????????, ??? ??????????? ??????? ???????????? ?????? ?????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????????????. ? ?????????? ??????? ???????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ? ???? ?????????? ?????????????? ?????? ? ???? ?????? ??????????? ???????????? ?????? ???????????? ????????. ??????????? ??????????? ????????????? ???????????????? ??????? ???????? ? ?????????? ?????????????????. ?? ?????? ???????????? ???????????? ?????? ?????????? ??????? ???????????????? ????????? ???????????? ???????? ????????? ??????????? ?????????. ??????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ?????? ? ????????? ??????? ??????????? ?????? ?????????. ??????? ????????? ??? ????????? ????????? ??????? ? ????????? ?????? ????????. ????????, ??? ??? ?????????? ??????? ?? ???? ????????? ??????????? ????????? ??????????? ?????????. ??? ???? ?????????? ????? ????????? ?????, ????????????? ????????? ?????? ??????????? ????????? ????????? ? ??????. ???????? ?????? ?????????? ??????? ?? ????. ????????, ??? ?????????? ??????????? ?????? ????????? ? ?????? ?????? ????????? ? ???????? ??????, ??????? ????? ????????????? ????????. ??????????? ??????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????? ????????? ? ???????? ????????? ??????...|$|R
40|$|In the FACET plasma-wakefield {{acceleration}} experiment a dense 23 GeV {{electron beam}} will interact with lithium and cesium plasmas, leading to plasma ion-channel formation. The {{interaction between the}} electron beam and the plasma sheath-electrons {{may lead to a}} fast growing electron hose instability. By using optics dispersion knobs to induce a controlled z-x tilt along the beam entering the plasma, we investigate the transverse behavior of the beam in the plasma as function of the tilt. We seek to quantify limits on the instability in order to further explore potential limitations on future plasma wakefield accelerators due to the electron hose instability. The FACET plasma-wakefield experiment at SLAC will study beam driven plasma wakefield acceleration. A dense 23 GeV electron beam will interact with lithium or cesium plasma, leading to plasma ion-channel formation. The interaction between the electron beam and the plasma sheath-electrons <b>drives</b> the electron <b>hose</b> instability, as first studied by Whittum. While Ref. [2] indicates the possibility of a large instability growth rate for typical beam and plasma parameters, other studies including have shown that several physical effects may mitigate the hosing growth rate substantially. So far there has been no quantitative benchmarking of experimentally observed hosing in previous experiments. At FACET we aim to perform such benchmarking by for example inducing a controlled z-x tilt along the beamentering the plasma, and observing the transverse behavior of the beam in the plasma as function. The long-term objective of these studies is to quantify potential limitations on future plasma wakefield accelerators due to the electron hose instability...|$|R
