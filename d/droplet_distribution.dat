40|$|AbstractSpray columns can {{potentially}} be utilized for absorbing CO 2 from large point {{sources such as}} flue gas exhausted by power plants. Low gas phase pressure drop, {{and the lack of}} internals which are susceptible to corrosion, make spray columns well suited for aqueous amine absorption. Design practices for spray columns are highly empirical and application specific. There is a paucity of data on absorption of CO 2 in aqueous amine sprays. Mass transfer data for CO 2 -amine systems is required for robust design of spray columns. Further, the absorption efficiency of sprays is greatly influenced by the surface area of drops, which in turn depends on the <b>droplet</b> size <b>distribution.</b> However, experimental data for <b>droplet</b> size <b>distributions</b> inside aqueous amine sprays is non-existent. Measurement of <b>droplet</b> size <b>distributions</b> is critical in providing a fundamental insight into spray absorption. This work presents molar flux data coupled with <b>droplet</b> size <b>distribution</b> data for CO 2 absorption into Monoethanolamine (MEA) spray. Both the molar flux measurements and the droplet size measurements are made inside a 0. 2 m glass column. The <b>droplet</b> size <b>distributions</b> are measured using a Phase Doppler Interferometer (PDI). Further, a novel method is utilized to quantify the available surface area from the <b>droplet</b> size <b>distribution</b> measurements.

40|$|To {{adapt to}} the trend toward {{low-energy}} precision irrigation, the <b>droplet</b> <b>distributions</b> for two new prototype sprinklers, outside signal sprinkler (OS) and fluidic sprinkler (FS), were compared with impact sprinkler (IS). A laser precipitation monitor {{was used to measure}} the <b>droplet</b> <b>distributions.</b> <b>Droplet</b> size and velocity distributions were tested under four operating pressures for nozzles 1. 5 m above the ground. For the operating pressures tested, the mean OS, FS and IS droplet diameters ranged from 0 to 3. 4, 0 to 3. 5, 0 to 4. 0 mm, respectively. The mean OS and FS droplet velocities ranged from 0 to 6. 3 m·s - 1, whereas IS ranged from 0 to 6. 3 m·s - 1. Being gas-liquid fluidic sprinklers, <b>droplet</b> <b>distributions</b> of the OS and FS were similar, although not identical. IS mostly produced a 0. 5 mm larger droplet diameter and a 0. 5 m·s - 1 greater velocity than OS and FS. A new empirical equation is proposed for determination of droplet size for OS and FS, which is sufficiently accurate and simple to use. Basic statistics for droplet size and velocity were performed on data obtained by the photographic methods. The mean droplet diameter (arithmetic, volumetric and median) decreased and the mean velocity increased in operating pressure for the three types of sprinkler...|$|R

40|$|Dispersed flow {{film boiling}} is {{characterized}} by liquid-phase droplets entrained in a continuous vapor-phase flow. In a previous work at MIT, a model of dispersed flow heat transfer was developed, called the Local Conditions Solution, which is amenable to hand calculation of wall temperatures. This solution identifies a single nonequilibrium parameter which depends solely on conditions at dryout, particularly a characteristic droplet diameter. Previous to the current study, no simple model including mechanisms occurring upstream of dryout had succeeded in predicting the <b>droplet</b> <b>distribution</b> at dryout. The Local Conditions Solution is rederived to identify which droplet diameter characterizes the distribution of droplets at dryout for purposes of dispersed flow heat transfer analysis. Based on mechanisms of droplet entrainment and deposition, the dryout <b>droplet</b> <b>distribution</b> is derived. This distribution is integrated to obtain the characteristic droplet diameter. A simple method of calculating the characteristic droplet diameter is presented. With the <b>droplet</b> <b>distribution</b> model, the Local Conditions Solution is compared with three correlations and seven data sets. In general, the Local Conditions Solution predicts wall temperature data to within about 5 % better than the three correlations. It is found that some data display a type of behavior not predicted by the Local Conditions Solution. This {{may be caused by}} the enhancement of droplet heat transfer by free stream turbulent fluctuations. Sponsored by National Science Foundation D. S. R. Projec...|$|E

40|$|A {{steady state}} model of {{co-current}} spray evaporator and air (de) humidifier for non-isothermal droplets {{has been developed}} to investigate the effect of polydispersity of droplet size on performance. The model is validated by comparison with results of Dickinson and Marshall (1968, AICHE J. 14, 541). It reveals that their ideal assumption of constant droplet temperature leads to significant error when the <b>droplet</b> size <b>distribution</b> is strongly polydisperse. Numerous simulation cases of the spray evaporator show that the average droplet diameter and <b>droplet</b> size <b>distribution</b> of water spray significantly affect {{the change in the}} air properties and the size, velocity and temperature of water droplets. For polydisperse droplets, a narrower <b>droplet</b> size <b>distribution</b> (# = 0. 2) shows a more rapid decrease in the diameter of the droplets, thus causing a more rapid temperature decrease and humidity increase of the air than the case of a broader <b>droplet</b> size <b>distribution</b> (# = 0. 4) with the same volume-averaged diameter.

The Eastern Pacific Emitted Aerosol Cloud Experiment and the Stratocumulus Observations of Los-Angeles Emissions Derived Aerosol-Droplets studies {{provided}} measurements in six {{case studies}} of cloud thermodynamic properties, initial particle number distribution and composition, and cloud drop distribution. In this study, we use simulations from a chemical and microphysical aerosol-cloud parcel (ACP) model with explicit kinetic drop activation to reproduce observed cloud <b>droplet</b> <b>distributions</b> of the case studies. Four cases had subadiabatic lapse rates, resulting in fewer activated droplets, lower liquid water content, and higher cloud base height than an adiabatic lapse rate. A weighted ensemble of simulations that reflect measured variation in updraft velocity and cloud base height was used to reproduce observed <b>droplet</b> <b>distributions.</b> Simulations show that organic hygroscopicity in internally mixed cases causes small effects on cloud reflectivity (CR) (< 0. 01), except for cargo ship and smoke plumes, which increased CR by 0. 02 and 0. 07, respectively, owing to their high organic mass fraction. Organic hygroscopicity had larger effects on droplet concentrations for cases with higher aerosol concentrations near the critical diameter (namely, polluted cases with a modal peak near 0. 1 [*]µm). Differences in simulated droplet spectral widths (k) caused larger differences in CR than organic hygroscopicity in cases with organic mass fractions of 60 % or less for the cases shown. Finally, simulations from a numerical parameterization of cloud droplet activation suitable for general circulation models compared well with the ACP model, except under high organic mass fraction...|$|R

40|$|Aims. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} in vivo the occurrence of outward fluid flow on primary tooth sound enamel surface. Methods. Sixty primary upper canines from preadolescent patients (mean age 8. 0 ± 1. 9) and 24 retained primary upper canines from adult subjects (mean age 35. 0 ± 1. 8). The enamel surface was gently polished and air dried for 10 s. An impression was immediately obtained by vinyl polyxiloxane. Replicas were then obtained by polyether impression material, gold coated and inspected under SEM. The hydrophobic vinyl polyxiloxane material enabled to obtain in situ a morphological image of the presence of droplets, most likely resulting from outward fluids flow through outer enamel. For each sample three different representative areas of 5 µ 2 in the cervical, medium and incisal third were examined and droplets presence values was recorded. All data were analyzed by by Fisher’s exact test. Results. Primary enamel showed a substantial permeability expressed as droplets discharge on its surface. <b>Droplets</b> <b>distribution</b> covered, without any specific localization, the entire enamel surface in all the samples. No signs of post-eruptive maturation with changes in <b>droplets</b> <b>distribution</b> were observed in samples from adult subjects. No statistically significant differences (P =. 955) were noted in the percentage distribution of enamel area covered with droplets among the two group studied. Conclusions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate a novel fiberoptic photometer for its ability to monitor physical instabilities occurring in concentrated emulsions during storage. For this, the fiber-optic photometer was used to measure transmission of oil-in-water emulsions stabilized with hypromellose (HPMC) as a function of oil volume fraction and <b>droplet</b> size <b>distribution</b> (DSD). To detect physical instabilities like creaming and coalescence, the transmissivity of the samples was studied at 2 different hight levels over a certain period of time. The corresponding <b>droplet</b> size <b>distributions</b> were determined by laser diffraction with PIDS. Transmissivity was found to depend on the number of dispersed droplets and thus is sensitive to both the variation of phase volume fraction as well as the emulsions <b>droplet</b> size <b>distribution.</b> At constant DSD, light transmission decreased linearly with increasing oil content within a large interval of phase volume fractions from 0. 01 to 0. 3. At constant phase volume fraction, an increase in droplet size increased light transmission. Investigation of creaming on emulsions with different <b>droplet</b> size <b>distributions</b> showed changes in the initial delay times and creaming velocities. In contrast to creaming phenomenon coalescence can be identified by height independent changes of the transmissivity. In conclusion, transmissivity of oil-in-water emulsions observed by the novel fiber-optic photometer is sensitive to phase volume fraction, <b>droplet</b> size <b>distribution,</b> and thus {{can be used as a}} tool for stability studies on concentrated emulsions...|$|R
40|$|An {{approximate}} numerical {{technique is}} used to investigate the influence of coagulation, sedimentation and turbulent motions on the observed <b>droplet</b> size <b>distribution</b> in the upper layers of the Venus clouds. If the cloud mass mixing ratio is less than 0. 000001 at 250 K or the eddy diffusivity throughout the cloud is greater than 1, 000, 000 sq cm per sec, then coagulation is unimportant. In this case, the observed <b>droplet</b> size <b>distribution</b> is the initial size distribution produced by the condensation of the droplets. It is found that all cloud models with droplet formation near the cloud top (e. g., a photochemical model) must produce the observed <b>droplet</b> size <b>distribution</b> by condensation without subsequent modification by coagulation. However, neither meteoritic or surface dust can supply sufficient nucleating particles {{to account for the}} observed droplet number density. If the cloud droplets are formed near the cloud bottom, the observed <b>droplet</b> size <b>distribution</b> can be produced solely by the interaction of coagulation and dynamics; all information about the initial size distribution is lost.
