The sentimental novel depicts the reality of slavery while also asserting that Christian love can overcome something as destructive as enslavement of <b>fellow</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b>|$|E
25|$|My {{sense of}} duty would not easily allow me to treat the unknown {{pathological}} state of my suffering brethren with these unknown medicines. The thought of becoming in this way a murderer or malefactor towards the life of my <b>fellow</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> was most terrible to me, so terrible and disturbing that I wholly gave up my practice {{in the first years}} of my married life and occupied myself solely with chemistry and writing.|$|E
25|$|By rationally {{seeking the}} truth, {{thinking}} freely, holding free discussions and testing teachings and authorities, freethinkers strive towards the full {{development of the}} human personality, {{with the emphasis on}} moral and rational conscience. This includes amongst other things an atheistic worldview, the choice for solidarity with <b>fellow</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> and the realisation that life is finite and a one-off occurrence. Also, physical and emotional development is considered important for a healthy and happy life. Precisely because life is finite, it is unique and valuable, and should be experienced to the fullest. Emotionally, one needs to cope with doubt, because the critical examination of one's own dearly held beliefs, and letting go of them if they turn out to be false, is necessary to seek the truth.|$|E

500|$|Andrew O'Malley {{writes in}} his survey of 18th-century children's literature, [...] "from helping poor animals [...] {{eventually}} makes a seamless transition to performing small acts of charity for the poor children he encounters". Charles learns to care for his <b>fellow</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> through his exposure to animals. Barbauld's Lessons is not, therefore, Romantic in the traditional sense; it does not emphasise the solitary self or the individual. As McCarthy puts it, [...] "every human being needs other human beings in order to live. Humans are communal entities".|$|E

500|$|The sensationalism in {{the press}} that started before the trial {{continued}} throughout the trial, the appeals process, the commutation decision, and beyond. At the time, local papers were the dominant source of information, {{but they were not}} entirely anti-Frank. The Constitution alone assumed Frank's guilt, while both the Georgian and the Journal would later comment about the public hysteria in Atlanta during the trial, each suggesting the need to reexamine the evidence against the defendant. [...] On March 14, 1914, while the extraordinary motion hearing was pending, the Journal called for a new trial, saying that to execute Frank based on the atmosphere both within and outside the courtroom would [...] "amount to judicial murder." [...] Other newspapers in the state followed suit and many ministers spoke from the pulpit supporting a new trial. L. O. Bricker, the pastor of the church attended by Phagan's family, said that based on [...] "the awful tension of public feeling, it was next to impossible for a jury of our <b>fellow</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> to have granted him a fair, fearless and impartial trial." ...|$|E

2500|$|Catherine Gee at the Daily Telegraph {{said that}} what Adam Curtis reveals, [...] "is the dangers of human beings at their most selfish and self-satisfying.

2500|$|To truly {{commemorate the}} victims of the Holocaust, we must harness the outrage of our {{memories}} to banish all human oppression from the world.

2500|$|The Lutheran Witness, a doctrinal {{document}} {{representing the}} Lutheran faith, supports {{the view that}} oaths should not generally be taken at all, except [...] "for the glory of God and the welfare of our neighbor." [...] Specifically, it states that proper use of God's name includes administration of oaths in court, and in swearing-in a spiritual or political leader to their respective offices, which include responsibilities toward God and <b>fellow</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Early Friends {{believed}} {{that it was important to}} avoid fanciness in dress, speech, and material possessions, because those things tend to distract one from waiting on God’s personal guidance. [...] They also tend to cause a person to focus on himself more than on his <b>fellow</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> in violation of Jesus’ teaching to [...] "love thy neighbor as thyself". [...] This emphasis on plainness, as it was called, made the Friends in certain times and places easily recognizable to the society around them, particularly by their plain dress in the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|E
60|$|Occupied is {{the correct}} word, for at first sight this man seemed to fill the room. Never since almost {{forgotten}} days when he used to frequent circuses and side shows, had Baxter seen a <b>fellow</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> so extraordinarily obese.

40|$|Properly {{understood}} speciesism regards {{membership in}} one's own species (e. g., <b>being</b> a <b>fellow</b> <b>human</b> <b>being)</b> as sufficient for sharing one's own moral status, but NOT as being necessary.

2500|$|... {{began to}} see Bismarck {{as a kind of}} malign genius who, behind the various postures, {{concealed}} an ice-cold contempt for his <b>fellow</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> and a methodical determination to control and ruin them. His easy chat combined blunt truths, partial revelations, and outright deceptions. His extraordinary double ability to see how groups would react and the willingness to use violence to make them obey, the capacity to read group behavior and the force to make them move to his will, gave him the chance to exercise what [...] called his [...] "sovereign self" ...|$|E
2500|$|Adam Susan, {{also known}} as the [...] "Leader", is the {{dictator}} of the puppet monarchy of Queen Zara, and leader of the Norsefire Party and its functions, although some of his power is ceremonial. Susan is in love with Fate (a computer system) and prefers its cold, mathematical companionship to that of his <b>fellow</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> Susan also expresses a solipsist belief that he and God (referring to the Fate computer) are the only truly [...] "real" [...] beings in existence, though he also believes that he must devote his life to leading his people. He is an adherent of fascism and racist notions of [...] "purity", and genuinely believes that civil liberties are dangerous and unnecessary. He appears to truly care for his people, however, and it is implied that his embrace of fascism was a response to his own loneliness. Before the War, he was a Chief Constable. He is assassinated by Rose Almond, the widow of one of his former lieutenants.|$|E
2500|$|Peace {{comes from}} God. [...] Meditation, {{the means of}} {{communicating}} with God, is unfruitful without the noble character of a devotee, {{there can be no}} worship without performing good deeds. Guru Nanak stressed now kirat karō: that a Sikh should balance work, worship, and charity, and should defend the rights of all creatures, and in particular, <b>fellow</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> They are encouraged to have a chaṛdī kalā, or optimistic - resilience, view of life. Sikh teachings also stress the concept of sharing—vaṇḍ chakkō—through the distribution of free food at Sikh gurdwaras (laṅgar), giving charitable donations, and working {{for the good of the}} community and others (sēvā). Sikhs believe that no matter what race, sex, or religion one is, all are equal in God's eyes. Men and women are equal and share the same rights, and women can lead in prayers. As with all Dharmic religions (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), ahimsa (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.|$|E

50|$|The {{difference}} between Mu'tazilis and other Muslim theologians is that Mu'tazilis consider al-nazar an obligation {{even if one}} does not encounter a <b>fellow</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> claiming to be a messenger from the Creator, and even if {{one does not have}} access to any alleged God-inspired or God-revealed scripture. On the other hand, the obligation of nazar to other Muslim theologians materializes upon encountering prophets or scripture.|$|R
2500|$|Fromm {{considered}} {{love to be}} an interpersonal creative capacity {{rather than}} an emotion, and he distinguished this creative capacity from what he considered to be various forms of narcissistic neuroses and sado-masochistic tendencies that are commonly held out as proof of [...] "true love". Indeed, Fromm viewed the experience of [...] "falling in love" [...] as evidence of one's failure to understand {{the true nature of}} love, which he believed always had the common elements of care, responsibility, respect, and knowledge. [...] Drawing from his knowledge of the Torah, Fromm pointed to the story of Jonah, who did not wish to save the residents of Nineveh from the consequences of their sin, as demonstrative of his belief that the qualities of care and responsibility are generally absent from most human relationships. Fromm also asserted that few people in modern society had respect for the autonomy of their <b>fellow</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> much less the objective knowledge of what other people truly wanted and needed.|$|E
2500|$|Not all {{interpretations of}} global {{citizenship}} are positive. For example, Parekh advocates {{what he calls}} globally oriented citizenship, and states, [...] "If global citizenship means being {{a citizen of the}} world, it is neither practicable nor desirable." [...] He argues that global citizenship, defined as an actual membership of a type of worldwide government system, is impractical and dislocated from one's immediate community. He also notes that such a world state would inevitably be [...] "remote, bureaucratic, oppressive, and culturally bland." [...] Parekh presents his alternate option with the statement: [...] "Since the conditions of life of our <b>fellow</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> in distant parts of the world should be a matter of deep moral and political concern to us, our citizenship has an inescapable global dimension, and we should aim to become what I might call a globally oriented citizen." [...] Parekh's concept of globally oriented citizenship consists of identifying with and strengthening ties towards one's political regional community (whether in its current state or an improved, revised form), while recognizing and acting upon obligations towards others {{in the rest of the}} world.|$|E
2500|$|Gellius {{says that}} in his day humanitas is {{commonly}} used as a synonym for philanthropyor kindness and benevolence toward one's <b>fellow</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean {{what we might call}} [...] "humane" [...] or [...] "polite" [...] learning, or the Greek equivalent Paideia. Yet in seeking to restrict the meaning of humanitas to literary education this way, Gellius was not advocating a retreat from political engagement into some ivory tower, though it might look like that to us. He himself was involved in public affairs. According to legal historian Richard Bauman, Gellius was a judge as well as a grammarian and was an active participant the great contemporary debate on harsh punishments that accompanied the legal reforms of Antoninus Pius (one these reforms, [...] for example, was that a prisoner was not to be treated as guilty before being tried). [...] "By assigning pride of place to Paideia in his comment on the etymology of humanitas, Gellius implies that the trained mind is best equipped to handle the problems troubling society." ...|$|E
50|$|The Water Splashing ceremony, however, is {{more than}} just good-natured fun; it also {{contains}} a religious element: water is regarded by the Dai as a symbol, firstly, of religious purity, but also of goodwill among people.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} how nurses in Kerala experience the caring of terminally ill patients and how the nurses provide care to promote the wellbeing among these patients. Being terminally ill is threatening for the quality of life and palliative care is important to promote the wellbeing of the patient. The number of immigrants in Sweden is increasing which makes it relevant to study various cultures to acknowledge patients’ different needs and wishes. Six registered nurses in one hospital in Kerala, India, were interviewed. All the nurses had experience of palliative care. The interviews were recorded and analyzed using an inductive approach. Three categories emerged from the analyzed material and they were; loneliness, wellbeing and dealing with work related emotions. It was evident in the result that the nurses found it important to care for the patient’s physical and psychological needs to promote the wellbeing. The result also showed that encountering patients like a <b>fellow</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> is essential when treating terminally ill patients, which is especially important to prevent feelings of loneliness. It is important to care for the patient’s emotional and basic needs. To care with a holistic perspective it is essential treat the patient like a <b>fellow</b> <b>human</b> <b>being...</b>|$|R
