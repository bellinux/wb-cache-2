50|$|In the belt-fed configuration, belt {{movement}} {{is produced by}} a roller riding in the channeled <b>feed</b> <b>arm</b> and is actuated by the reciprocating movement of the bolt. The spring-loaded <b>feed</b> <b>arm</b> is protected by a hinged top cover and is pivoted at its rear end. As the bolt travels back, {{the front end of}} the <b>feed</b> <b>arm</b> moves across the feed tray and operates a lever attached to a single set of spring-loaded pawls. These pawls move a cartridge and link over the feed tray’s stop pawl from where they are positioned onto the slotted feed path and held firmly in place by a spring-powered steel plate in the top cover. The cartridge is then pushed out of its link and the empty link is discarded through the link ejection port which is held closed by a spring-loaded dust cover.|$|E

50|$|Because the M2 was {{intentionally}} {{designed to}} operate in many configurations, it {{can be adapted to}} feed from the left or right side of the weapon by exchanging the belt-holding pawls, and the front and rear cartridge stops (three-piece set to include link stripper), then reversing the bolt switch.

40|$|The graptolites, {{known only}} from fossils, have been convincingly allied to the pterobranch hemichordates, {{a group of}} tiny, mostly colonial marine {{invertebrates}} bearing <b>feeding</b> <b>arms.</b> The phylogenetic position of pterobranchs has been subject to debate and revision for over a century. Their colonial lifestyle and <b>feeding</b> <b>arms</b> were originally seen as evidence placing them among the bryozoans, until later and more careful anatomical studies revealed more characters in common with acorn worms. Pterobranchs and acorn worms are now grouped as the phylum Hemichordata. For many decades, {{it was thought that}} pterobranchs were closer to the ancestral form of hemichordates, particularly because 'lophophorate'invertebrates also possess <b>feeding</b> <b>arms,</b> notably the phoronids and bryozoans, as do crinoid echinoderms. This traditional view has been challenged by recent molecular evidence. First, there is strong molecular evidence to indicate that lophophorates are very distant from hemichordates and echinoderms, in a different major branch of the animal phylogenetic tree. Therefore, similarities between the feeding structures must be due to convergent evolution. Second, there is strong evidence that hemichordates and echinoderms form a clade (Ambulacraria) within the deuterostomes, rather than hemichordates being closer to chordates. Third, there is weaker evidence that pterobranchs may be derived from acorn worms, and hence that the vermiform body plan may be ancestral within hemichordates. This suggestion warrants further testing. Here we review the evidence for these conclusions, highlight strengths and weaknesses in the data and analyses, and consider the implications for the origins of pterobranchs and graptolites. © Journal compilation © 2008 The Lethaia Foundation...|$|R
50|$|The SIG MG 710-3 is fed {{from the}} left side by either NATO {{standard}} disintegrating M13 (U.S.) or continuous link German DM1 belt, but only after swapping several parts in the feed block.

The feeding mechanism resembles the one used in the MAG machine gun (a simplified version of the MG 42's feed system) operated with a <b>feed</b> <b>arm</b> driven by the motion of the striker sleeve.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn {{order to improve}} the prompt response from an impulse radiating antenna (IRA) {{number of studies have}} suggested controlling the spatial distribution of the aperture fields by changing the <b>feed</b> <b>arm</b> angle.

This paper shows how the radiated prompt response can be maximized for a given <b>feed</b> <b>arm</b> configuration by shaping the aperture to eliminate fields orientated in the wrong direction. The percent increase in the prompt radiated electric field for a 200.

Commercial “Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) ” package, ANSYS Fluent was used to interpret the impact of flow features and heat transfer characteristics on surface deposition. The experimental data obtained in this work were used in a one dimensional heat transfer model for prediction of deposit thickness in simulated burner feed arms. Subsequently, the simulated burner <b>feed</b> <b>arm</b> with contraction/expansion structure were sectioned and prepared for deposit visualisation with “Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) ”. The results of visualised deposits are consistent with one dimensional heat transfer calculation.

40|$|Pterobranchs are of {{particular}} interest to evolutionary biologists because as members of the phylum Hemichordata, they share characteristics with vertebrate animals and other chordates. The focus of this study is an examination of the development, structure, and function of the <b>feeding</b> <b>arms</b> in several species of pterobranchs collected from depths greater than 500 m from waters surrounding Antarctica. Pterobranch zooids in the genus Cephalodiscus feed using a crown of arms held over the dorsal surface of the body to filter particles from the water. Larvae released from adult tubes are ciliated, but lack <b>feeding</b> <b>arms</b> and are thought to derive energy from internal yolk stores. However, we have observed larvae of at least one species respond to the presence of particulate food, suggesting that these developmental forms may feed without the aid of adult structures. The <b>feeding</b> <b>arms</b> develop on the dorsal side of the animal, often beginning with a pair near the central axis followed by pairs of arms to the left and right. Each arm develops from a trilobed bud. The adult feeding apparatus consists of up to twelve arms held in a sphere on the dorsal side of the animal. Each arm has multiple tentacles, which are paired {{along the length of the}} arm until the apical-most tip. Scanning electron microscopy reveals that a single tentacle has two tracts of cilia along its outer face which may beat to draw water across the tentacular net or capture food particles. Food particles, including bacteria and single-celled algae, may then be conveyed down the tentacle to a deep, thickly ciliated groove on the outer face of the arm central to the paired tentacles, and eventually to the mouth. Scanning electron and light microscopy have elucidated the structures associated with feeding, as well as unusual refractive spheres at the tip of each arm in some species...|$|R
40|$|We examine here {{a number}} of {{variations}} of Reflector Impulse Radiating Antennas (IRAs) that are useful when the feed arms are flexible. When feed arms are built using a conducting fabric or membrane, {{the end of the}} feed arms are often contained entirely within the radius of a circular reflector, to keep the feed arms under tension. This displaces the feed arms {{toward the center of the}} reflector from the standard position where the charge center of the feed arms intersects the reflector rim. We investigate here the effect of that <b>feed</b> <b>arm</b> displacement while varying the feed impedance and <b>feed</b> <b>arm</b> position. We also investigate the effect of shaping the reflector to exclude the portion of the aperture that contributes destructively to the radiated field. For each of these configurations, we calculate the effective height, antenna gain, and sidelobe level. In this paper, we consider {{a number of}} configurations of the Impulse Radiating Antenna (IRA) that are useful with flexible feed arms. These IRA variations include the Para-IRA [1] and the Membrane IRA [2]. In such designs, the feed arms must remain under tension, so it is often easier to place the feed arms such that their outside edge intersects the outer rim of the paraboli...|$|E
40|$|Two offset IRAs are numerically modeled and analyzed. The {{reflector}} of the offset IRA is an offset {{portion of}} a paraboloid that is carved out by {{the intersection of the}} paraboloid and a cone whose apex is at {{the focal point of the}} paraboloid. A pair of conical curved plates is placed on the surface of the cone as TEM feed arms. The TEM <b>feed</b> <b>arm</b> of the first IRA is conical throughout its length and terminated at the reflector through two electrically small resistors. The TEM <b>feed</b> <b>arm</b> of the second IRA is partly conical and tapered to one electrically small resistor.

The radiated waveforms both in the far- and near-zones, radiation patterns, impulse and prepulse amplitude distributions as functions of observation angle, spot sizes, and power budgets for the offset IRA and the center-fed IRA are presented and compared. The results show that the tail waveform of the offset IRA is significantly lower in amplitude and simpler in shape than that of the center-fed IRA. Both IRAs have a shadow behind the reflector...|$|E
