40|$|Commercial {{production}} of the <b>kiwiberry</b> (<b>Actinidia</b> <b>arguta)</b> is relatively new in northern and western Europe. When introducing the kiwiberry to a region where fruit growers have no experience with Actinidia, many challenges {{have had to be}} overcome. For instance, the profile of the growers willing to invest in this crop is very diverse, the geographic regions have their specific climatic and soil conditions and, clearly, cultivation of the kiwiberry has very specific requirements. Therefore, proper technical advice is extremely important to obtain productive orchards. Although A. arguta is quite hardy, spring frosts are a major concern and a strongly limiting factor for yields in Europe. In recent initiatives, different cultivars with a commercial potential are being screened for frost tolerance, but currently, frost protection using sprinkler irrigation is in many cases the only and most effective system. However, growing kiwiberries in greenhouses appears to be a valuable and commercially viable alternative in The Netherlands and Belgium. The combination of a recommended fertilizer program and irrigation management, artificial pollination methods, appropriate pruning and good training {{has proven to be a}} very successful approach with yields as high as 18 t/ha five years after planting. Apart from establishing productive orchards, the successful introduction of kiwiberry as a novel fruit onto the market involves other important issues as well. Since the price of new fruits is usually rather high, growers have to realize that a product quality is essential for long-term success. Therefore, much attention must be paid to efficient grading and stringent quality control...|$|E
40|$|Background: With its simple library {{preparation}} and robust approach to genome reduction, genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is a flexible and cost-effective strategy for SNP discovery and genotyping, provided an appropriate reference genome is available. For resource-limited curation, research, and breeding programs of underutilized plant genetic resources, however, even low-depth references {{may not be}} within reach, despite declining sequencing costs. Such programs would find value in an open-source bioinformatics pipeline that can maximize GBS data usage and perform high-density SNP genotyping {{in the absence of}} a reference. Results: The GBS SNP-Calling Reference Optional Pipeline (GBS-SNP-CROP) developed and presented here adopts a clustering strategy to build a population-tailored “Mock Reference” from the same GBS data used for downstream SNP calling and genotyping. Designed for libraries of paired-end (PE) reads, GBS-SNP-CROP maximizes data usage by eliminating unnecessary data culling due to imposed read-length uniformity requirements. Using 150 bp PE reads from a GBS library of 48 accessions of tetraploid <b>kiwiberry</b> (<b>Actinidia</b> <b>arguta),</b> GBS-SNP-CROP yielded on average three times as many SNPs as TASSEL-GBS analyses (32 and 64 bp tag lengths) and over 18 times as many as TASSEL-UNEAK, with fewer genotyping errors in all cases, as evidenced by comparing the genotypic characterizations of biological replicates. Using the published reference genome of a related diploid species (A. chinensis), the reference-based version of GBS-SNP-CROP behaved similarly to TASSEL-GBS in terms of the number of SNPs called but had an improved read depth distribution and fewer genotyping errors. Our results also indicate that the sets of SNPs detected by the different pipelines above are largely orthogonal to one another; thus GBS-SNP-CROP may be used to augment the results of alternative analyses, whether or not a reference is available. Conclusions: By achieving high-density SNP genotyping in populations for which no reference genome is available, GBS-SNP-CROP is worth consideration by curators, researchers, and breeders of under-researched plant genetic resources. In cases where a reference is available, especially if from a related species or when the target population is particularly diverse, GBS-SNP-CROP may complement other reference-based pipelines by extracting more information per sequencing dollar spent. The current version of GBS-SNP-CROP is available at [URL]...|$|E

40|$|A field {{experiment}} with <b>Actinidia</b> <b>arguta</b> and A. kolomikta cultivars purchased from a commercial nursery {{was conducted in}} Skierniewice, central Poland. Both <b>Actinidia</b> <b>arguta</b> and A. kolomikta cultivars were planted in June 2005 at a spacing of 3 × 2. 2 m. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the influence of climate conditions on the growth of eight cultivars of small kiwi fruit and to evaluate their usefulness for orchard culture in central Poland. After three years of growth in different climate conditions, including one of the coldest winters (2005 / 06) during the last years, and also severe late spring frosts (2007), some conclusion can be drawn. Two cultivars of Actinidia kolomikta have shown quite good resistance to winter and spring frosts, but the growth rate of these plants was rather slow. All the cultivars of <b>Actinidia</b> <b>arguta</b> were damaged by frost during the 2005 / 06 winter due to the snow-cover level, which was rather thick (24 cm). One year later all new shoots and leaves of <b>Actinidia</b> <b>arguta</b> cultivars were damaged completely by late spring frosts, which deleted flowering and fruit setting for at least one year. After three years of growth observations, the growth rate of small kiwi cultivars can be divided into three groups: fast growing with 'Jumbo' and 'Genewa'; moderate growing with 'Issai', 'Ken's Red' and 'Weiki' - male and female, and slow growing with A. kolomikta cultivars Dr Szymanowski and Sientiabrskaja...|$|R

The research of this species {{has been carried out}} at the Experimental station of the Institute of Genetics and Plant Physiology of the Academy of Scien ce of Moldova throughout in the period of eight years. Particular atten-tion was paid to optimization of the methods of vegetative propagation and conditions of cultivation of a perspective and highly productive clone named Tatiana, previously selected from the generative pro pa-gated plants. The apical meristems of adult plants served as source for elaborating the method of in vitro micropropagation. As a re sult of testing different nutrients, the cultural medium for in  vitro pro-pa gation (with the multiplication factor equal to seven) and orga-no ge nesis was elaborated. Plants adaptation to ex  vitro conditions was assured by gradually increasing the light intensity, reducing the relative humidity from 95 % to that of natural. In conditions of Cent ral Moldova the crop yield from one 5 – 7 -year plant of Tatiana clone was varying between 2 and 10  kg.

From these results, A. arguta fruit produced in Shinjo can be evaluated as vitamin C-rich fruit with abundant polyphenol substances, and several useful minerals such as Ca, Mg, and Mn. 岡山県新庄村で栽培されているサルナシ果実の健康食品としての評価を行うために，同地区のサルナシ園で生産された３品種（光香，峰香，在来種）の果実，及び近隣の山地で収穫された野生サルナシ果実の成分分析を行った．参考として，岡山市内のマーケットで購入された輸入のキウイフルーツ（ヘイワード），レモン（品種不明），及び国産のリンゴ（ふじ）の成分も調査した．サルナシ栽培品種では，収穫適期でも硬熟状態のものと軟熟状態のものが混在し，さらに普通の果実の半分程度の小果実（すべて軟熟）も混在した．果汁のビタミンＣ含量は，峰香の硬熟果と光香の小果で 220 ～ 260 ㎎/ 100 mLと非常に高い値を示した．市販のキウイフルーツのビタミンＣ含量は約 100 ㎎，レモンで 50 ㎎，リンゴは４㎎/ 100 mL程度であった．サルナシ果汁の全ポリフェノール含量とラジカル消去能はキウイフルーツと大差がなかったが，リンゴに比べれば有意に高かった．サルナシはキナ酸含量が最も高く，無機成分のN,Ca,Mg,Mn含量が高かったが，糖含量は低かった．本分析結果から，サルナシ果実はビタミンとポリフェノールが豊富で，現代人の食事で不足しがちなミネラルも多いことから，健康食品として評価されうる...|$|R
40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) is {{a chronic}} inflammatory skin disease, which requires {{safe and effective}} pharmacological therapy. We previously found that two preparations from <b>Actinidia</b> <b>arguta,</b> PG 102 T, and PG 102 E, could modulate Th 1 /Th 2 pathways and suppress IgE biosynthesis. This study was performed to assess the therapeutic effects of PG 102 T and PG 102 E {{on the development of}} dermatitis in NC/Nga mice, characterized by the spontaneous onset of AD along with an elevated level of IgE under conventional conditions. PG 102 T or PG 102 E administration significantly reduced dermatitis severity as well as scratching tendency in conventional mice. The suppression of dermatitis by PG 102 was accompanied by a decrease in the plasma level of IgE, IgG 1, and IL- 4 and also by an increase in that of IgG 2 a and IL- 12. The splenic level of IL- 4, IL- 5, and IL- 10 was downregulated, whereas that of IFN-γ and IL- 12 was increased. The number of eosinophils and the expression of eotaxin and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine were decreased by PG 102 T or PG 102 E. Histological findings also indicated that the thickening of epidermis/dermis and the dermal infiltration of inflammatory cells including mast cells were greatly inhibited. These data suggest that PG 102 may be effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of AD...|$|R
40|$|Actinidia species show a {{relatively}} high uptake of N, K, Cl and Ca. Nitrogen is an important nutrient for good cane growth, but too much nitrogen causes excessive vegetative growth, poor yields, and increased winter injury. Applications of nitrogen {{at the end of}} the fruiting season enhance fruit size but are discouraged as fruit then tend to store poorly. Special attention should also be paid to boron (B) and sodium (Na) as the kiwifruit is extremely sensitive to excess of both elements in the soil. Actinidia deliciosa needs comparatively high concentrations of chloride for optimum growth. Therefore, unless the natural soil is high in Cl (> 150 mg/kg) and/or low in N, K should be preferably applied as KCl. K is more readily absorbed by kiwifruit in its chloride form than as sulfate. Yield differences up to 30 % have been recorded in relation to the chloride content of the soil. Until now there were only few studies examining chlorine effects and content in <b>Actinidia</b> <b>arguta.</b> Some experiments with young plants in pot culture were performed. The vegetative plant parts were analyzed to study the effects of chloride on the growth and development of 3 cultivars ('Jumbo', 'Ken's Red' and 'Maki'). The results clearly show that also this species has a great demand of chloride for optimal growth...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{traditional}} {{systems of}} medicine, fruits, leaves, and stems of <b>Actinidia</b> <b>arguta</b> (Sieb. et Zucc.) Planch. ex Miq. {{have been used}} to treat various inflammatory diseases. The present study determined the proximate composition, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hypoglycemic potential of A. arguta stem. Phenolic composition of hot water extract and its sub-fractions was determined by Folin–Ciocalteu’s reagent method. In vitro antioxidant activities of the samples were evaluated using 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2, 2 ′-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) radical scavenging assays. Anti-inflammatory activity of different fractions was investigated through the inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide (1 μg/ml) stimulated RAW 264. 7 cells. In addition, inhibition of α-glucosidase activity of hot water extract was determined using p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG) as a substrate. Ethyl acetate (557. 23 mgGAE/g) fraction contains higher level of total phenolic content. The antioxidant activity evaluated by DPPH radical scavenging assay showed a strong activity for ethyl acetate (IC 50 of 14. 28 μg/ml) and n-butanol fractions (IC 50 of 48. 27 μg/ml). Further, ethyl acetate fraction effectively inhibited NO production in RAW 264. 7 cells induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) than other fractions (nitrite level to 32. 14 μM at 200 μg/ml). In addition, hot water extract of A. arguta stem exhibited appreciable inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase enzyme with IC 50 of 1. 71 mg/ml. The obtained results have important consequence of using A. arguta stem toward the development of effective anti-inflammatory drugs...|$|R
40|$|In vivo {{measurements}} of ¹⁴C tracer distribution have usually involved monitoring the b- particles produced as ¹⁴C decays. These particles are only detectable over short distances, limiting {{the use of}} this technique to thin plant material. In the present experiments, X-ray detectors were used to monitor the Bremsstrahlung radiation emitted since b- particles were absorbed in plant tissues. Bremsstrahlung radiation is detectable through larger tissue depths. The aim of these experiments was to demonstrate the Bremsstrahlung method by monitoring in vivo tracer-labelled photosynthate partitioning in small kiwifruit (<b>Actinidia</b> <b>arguta</b> (Siebold & Zucc.) Planch. ex Miq.) plants in response to root pruning. A source shoot, consisting of four leaves, was pulse labelled with ¹⁴CO₂. Detectors monitored import into a fruit and the root system, and export from a source leaf. Repeat pulse labelling enabled the comparison of pre- and post-treatment observations within an individual plant. Diurnal trends were observed in the distribution of tracer, with leaf export reduced at night. Tracer accumulated in the roots declined after approximately 48 h, which may have resulted from export of ¹⁴C from the roots in carbon skeletons. Cutting off half the roots did not affect tracer distribution to the remaining half. Tracer distribution to the fruit was increased after root pruning, demonstrating the higher competitive strength of the fruit than the roots for carbohydrate supply. Increased partitioning to the fruit following root pruning has also been demonstrated in kiwifruit field trials...|$|R
