5000|$|<b>Dollar</b> <b>diplomacy</b> of the United States—particularly during President William Howard Taft's term— {{was a form}} against American {{foreign policy}} to further its aims in Latin America and East Asia through use of its {{economic}} power by guaranteeing loans made to foreign countries. Historian Thomas A. Bailey argues that <b>dollar</b> <b>diplomacy</b> was nothing new, {{as the use of}} diplomacy to promote commercial interest dates from {{the early years of the}} Republic. However, under Taft, the State Department was more active than ever in encouraging and supporting American bankers and industrialists in securing new opportunities abroad. Bailey finds that <b>dollar</b> <b>diplomacy</b> was designed to make both people in foreign lands and the American investors prosper. [...] The term was originally coined by previous President Theodore Roosevelt, who did not want to intervene between Taft and Taft's secretary of state.|$|E

The policy opened the door for American banks to lend money to the Nicaraguan government, ensuring United States control over the country's finances.|$|E

5000|$|In essence, Roosevelt's Monroe Doctrine {{would be}} the basis for a use of {{economic}} and military hegemony to make the U.S. the dominant power in the Western Hemisphere. The new doctrine was a frank statement that the U.S. was willing to seek leverage over Latin American governments by acting as an international police power in the region. This announcement has been described as the policy of [...] "speaking softly but carrying a big stick", and consequently launched a period of [...] "big stick" [...] diplomacy, in contrast with later <b>Dollar</b> <b>Diplomacy.</b> Roosevelt's approach was more controversial among isolationist-pacifists in the U.S.|$|E

Theodore Roosevelt declared the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine in 1904, asserting the right of the United States to intervene to stabilize the economic affairs of states in the Caribbean and Central America if they were unable to pay their international debts. From 1909-1913, President William Howard Taft and his Secretary of State Philander C.

50|$|In foreign affairs, Taft {{focused on}} East Asia and {{repeatedly}} intervened {{to prop up}} or remove Latin American governments.

His administration followed a policy of <b>Dollar</b> <b>Diplomacy,</b> hoping to use U.S. investment to enhance U.S. influence in Latin America. The defense of the Panama Canal, which was completed in 1914, was central to Taft's foreign policy. The Taft administration also sought reductions to trade tariffs, then {{a major source of}} governmental income, but the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act of 1909 was heavily influenced by special interests.

50|$|A {{crisis in}} the Dominican Republic became the first test case for the Roosevelt Corollary. Deeply in debt, the nation {{struggled}} to repay its European creditors. Fearing another intervention by Germany and Britain, Roosevelt reached an agreement with Dominican President Carlos Felipe Morales to take temporary control of the Dominican economy, much as the U.S. had done on a permanent basis in Puerto Rico. The U.S. {{took control of the}} Dominican customs house, brought in economists such as Jacob Hollander to restructure the economy, and ensured a steady flow of revenue to the Dominican Republic's foreign creditors.

5000|$|<b>Dollar</b> <b>diplomacy</b> wasn't always peaceful. In Nicaragua, U.S. [...] "intervention {{involved}} {{participating in}} the overthrow of one government and the military support" [...] of another. When a revolt broke out in Nicaragua in 1912, the Taft administration quickly sided with the insurgents (who had been instigated by U.S. mining interests) and sent U.S. troops into the country to seize the customs houses. As soon as the U.S. consolidated control over the country, Secretary of State Philander C. Knox encouraged U.S. bankers {{to move into the}} country and offer substantial loans to the new regime, thus increasing U.S. financial leverage over the country. Within two years, however, the new pro-U.S. regime faced a revolt of its own; and, once again, the administration landed U.S. troops in Nicaragua, this time to protect the tottering, corrupt U.S. regime. U.S. troops remained there for over a decade.|$|E

After few days in Caracas burst the Libertadora Revolution a civil war, in which a coalition of regional caudillos headed by the wealthy banker Manuel Antonio Matos, allied with transnational corporations (New York & Bermúdez Company, Orinoco Steamship Company, and the French Cable among others), tried to overthrow the president Cipriano Castro. In some battles Castro personally participated at command of the government troops, including the most important such as [...] The siege of La Victoria in November, 1902, where with 6,500 men manages to defeat to the 14,000 revolutionaries who tried to take by force.

This thesis analyzes the United States' <b>Dollar</b> <b>Diplomacy</b> and its practices towards the Ottoman Empire during William Howard Taft's presidency. The United States {{was not quite}} interested in improving its economic and diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire, before the reopen of the Ottoman Parliament in 1908. On the other hand, the declaration of the Second Constitution and new parliamentary system grasped {{the attention of the}} US Government. From the American point of view, this new state system would be more open and acquiescent to adopt American institutions and cooperation in various fields, in the name of modernization. The United States commenced to increase its economic, diplomatic, and commercial relations with the Ottoman Empire, in this era. During Taft's presidency, American foreign policy concentrated on assisting and protecting any American commercial interests, around the world with the promotion of American businesses, investment, and trade. In his short term, Taft gave importance to conduct this policy, which cited as the <b>Dollar</b> <b>Diplomacy,</b> in the Ottoman Empire along with Central American states and China. This policy could not reach its ultimate success in the empire in aspect of promoting American investments intensely, in this country. As they experienced throughout the Chester Project, which was a significant railroad concession project in the Eastern Anatolia, the Ottoman Empire struggled with political problems in this era and its negative effect over the American investments were distinguishable. Still, this era witnessed significant progress in not only in aspect of promotion of American initiatives, as the Chester Project, but also economic and commercial relations {{with the help of the}} State Department. by Murat İplikçiM.

Two events catalyzed this evolution, both occurring in the Caribbean. The outcome of the Spanish-American War proved the first, with direct possession of Puerto Rico and other territories, as well as virtual control over Cuba as a protectorate. Soon thereafter, primarily associated with President William Howard Taft, <b>Dollar</b> <b>Diplomacy</b> provided a vehicle for U. S. sovereignty over the Dominican Republic and other areas of the Caribbean, substituting "dollars for bullets. " The U. S. projected its power into these arenas, seeking to reshape and develop regional Latin American polities into capitalistic, democratic nations in the American image.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the history of}} U. S. interventions in Latin America and attempts to explain their frequency by highlighting two factors – besides security and economic interests – that have made American interventions in Latin America so common. First, immense differences in size and influence between the United States and the States of Latin America have made interventions {{appear to be a}} low risk solution to crises that threaten American interests in the region. Second, when U. S government concerns and aspirations for Latin America converge with the general fears and aspirations of American foreign policy, interventions become much more likely. Such a convergence pushes Latin American issues high up the U. S. foreign policy agenda because of the region’s proximity to the United States and the perception that costs of intervening are low. The leads proponents of intervention to begin asking questions like “if we cannot stop communism/revolutions/drug-trafficking in Latin America, where can we stop it?” This article traces how these factors influenced the decision to intervene in Latin America during the era of <b>Dollar</b> <b>Diplomacy</b> and during the Cold War. It concludes with three possible scenarios {{that could lead to a}} reemergence of an American interventionist policy in Latin America. It makes the argument that even though the United Sates has not intervened in Latin America during the twenty-two years, it is far from clear that American interventions in Latin America will be consigned to the past...|$|E
