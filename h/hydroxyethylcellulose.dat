40|$|Modification {{of cement}} mortars with {{small amounts of}} {{water-soluble}} polymers (1 % of polyvinyl alcohol-acetate, methylcellulose or <b>hydroxyethylcellulose)</b> is studied. The effect of water-soluble polymers on the microstructure is twofold: cement hydration reactions can be influenced and polymer films or bridges can be formed. Cement hydration is studied at several time intervals by means of thermal analysis, XRD and FT-IR. The addition of small amounts of <b>hydroxyethylcellulose</b> strongly retards the cement hydration during the first 24 hours of hydration. After 48 hours, this delay is almost eliminated. Polymer modified mortars show a slightly higher amount of bound water than unmodified mortars. Nevertheless, the Ca(OH) 2 content is decreased by polymer modification. SEM investigation is used to characterize the morphology of the cement hydrates. A large crystal growth is noticed at the air void surfaces, where the presence of water-soluble polymers is expected because of their strong affinity to the gas-water phase. Mortars modified with methylcellulose, a polymer with a high swelling capacity, show an abundant Ca(OH) 2 efflorescence.

The effect of water-soluble polymers on the microstructure can be twofold: cement hydration reactions can be influenced {{and the formation of}} polymer films or bridges can take place. Cement hydration is studied by isothermal calorimetry and by thermal analysis (DTG and DSC) at several time intervals. At very early ages, a new peak in the DTG and DSC graphs of the polymer modified pastes is detected, pointing to a possible interaction between the polymers and the cement hydration reactions. The peak disappears when the hydration reactions are accelerated. The addition of small amounts of <b>hydroxyethylcellulose</b> strongly retards the cement hydration during the first 24 hours of hydration. Polymer modified cement pastes show a slightly higher amount of bound water than unmodified pastes after 90 days of hydration. Nevertheless, the Ca(OH) 2 content is decreased by polymer modification. Some indirect and direct indications of polymer film formation are presented. Mechanical strength tests show a major increase of the flexural strength of the polymer modified mortars when a dry curing, which favours the polymer film formation, is applied. By SEM investigation, the presence of polymer bridges between undistorted Ca(OH) 2 crystals and indications of the integration of polymers in the cement matrix are observed. status: publishe...|$|E
