A crew of eight pilot a colossal nuclear bomb aboard the {{spaceship}} Icarus II, {{with the intent to}} jump start the sun, and return to Earth. As they slingshot past Mercury, Icarus II discovers the <b>distress</b> <b>beacon</b> of Icarus I, the first ship to attempt their mission, which disappeared seven years earlier. Reasoning that two bombs {{have a better chance of}} success than one, physicist Capa recommends Captain Kaneda change course and commandeer Icarus I. Mace, the ship's engineer, opposes the deviation as risky. Navigator Trey calculates a trajectory to intercept Icarus I, but forgets to realign the shields that protect the ship from the sun, causing damage to four shield panels.|$|E

500|$|Cortana {{returns in}} the third {{installment}} in the Halo series, the 2007 Xbox 360 game Halo 3. During gameplay, Cortana appears to the player in broken transmissions, often reciting lines from Fall of Reach and earlier games. Cortana manages {{to send a message}} to the Master Chief on Earth through a [...] Flood-infected ship. In her message, she states that Gravemind is unaware of the portal opened by a Forerunner artifact on Earth. Cortana continues to appear to the Chief, who later recovers her from Flood-controlled High Charity. Surprised that the Chief has against all odds rescued her (as promised) Cortana produces the Index from Installation 04, which she has kept as a souvenir. With it, Cortana activates a new ringworld being constructed. While the Flood are destroyed as planned, the slipspace portal through which Master Chief, the Arbiter, and Cortana attempt to escape collapses, thus stranding the Chief and Cortana. Cortana activates a <b>distress</b> <b>beacon,</b> but she knows that years could pass before rescue comes. As the Master Chief prepares to go into cryonic sleep to await rescue, Cortana confides to him that she will miss him. He replies to wake him when she needs him.|$|E

500|$|Chief, Arbiter, Elites, Johnson, Keyes, and U.N.S.C. troops {{follow the}} Covenant [...] "Prophet of Truth" [...] through the portal, joined by 343 Guilty Spark, who aids the Chief {{as he has}} no {{function}} to fulfill after the destruction of his ringworld. During the ensuing battle between humans, Covenant, and the Flood on the Ark, Johnson is captured by Truth to activate the Halo rings. Keyes tries to intervene, but is killed. Master Chief and the Arbiter, aided by the Flood, kill Truth and rescue Johnson. After finding out that the Ark is constructing a replacement for Guilty Spark's Halo ring, Installation 09, Master Chief decides to fire the unstable Halo, destroying both the Flood and the Ark. After finding out about their plan, Guilty Spark kills Johnson and tries to kill Master Chief, but Master Chief destroys Guilty Spark and activates the Halo. Master Chief and the Arbiter escape on the UNSC frigate Forward Unto Dawn, but the slipspace portal closes with Master Chief's half trapped in space. After a memorial service on Earth {{for the victims of}} the Human-Covenant war, the Arbiter and his Elite brethren depart for their home planet. The rear half of Forward Unto Dawn floats in deep space. Cortana activates a <b>distress</b> <b>beacon</b> and the Chief goes into hibernation.|$|E
500|$|Back on Earth, the Master Chief {{helps to}} repel hostile Covenant forces from Mombasa, Kenya and Voi. With the Arbiter (a Covenant Elite who has sided with humanity) and fellow allies, the Chief leads {{the assault on}} a Forerunner {{artifact}} that the Covenant Prophet of Truth is attempting to activate. Soon after Truth escapes Earth through the slipspace portal opened by the artifact, the Flood lands on Earth. After helping to control the infestation, the Master Chief follows Truth to the Ark, an immense constructed world more than 262,144light-years {{from the center of}} the Milky Way galaxy and well beyond the range of any Halo. There, all the Halos can be remotely activated, thus killing all sentient life that could be infested by the Flood. It is discovered that a new Halo is being constructed to replace the one that the Master Chief destroyed in Halo: Combat Evolved. The Flood follow the Chief to the Ark, bringing High Charity through the slipspace portal to escape the range of the six original Halos. The allied Elites and humans decide to activate the new Halo in order to kill the Flood outside the galaxy, and thus preserve life there. 343 Guilty Spark opposes the premature activation of the incomplete installation and attempts to stop it. Master Chief destroys him, activates the ring, and escapes with Cortana and the Arbiter on the UNSC frigate Forward Unto Dawn. During the escape, the collapsing slipspace portal severs the Dawn in two, stranding Cortana and the Master Chief deep in space. While the Arbiter returns to Earth, Cortana activates a <b>distress</b> <b>beacon,</b> knowing that rescue could take years; the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep, telling Cortana, [...] "Wake me, when you need me."

50|$|Distress radiobeacons, also collectively {{known as}} <b>distress</b> <b>beacons,</b> {{emergency}} beacons, or simply, beacons, are those tracking transmitters that operate {{as part of}} the international Cospas-Sarsat Search and Rescue satellite system. When activated, these beacons send out a distress signal that, when detected by non-geostationary satellites, can be located by triangulation. In the case of 406 MHz beacons which transmit digital signals, the beacons can be uniquely identified almost instantly (via GEOSAR), and furthermore, a GPS position can be encoded into the signal (thus providing both instantaneous identification & position.) Distress signals from the beacons are homed by Search and Rescue (SAR) aircraft and ground search parties who can in turn {{come to the aid of}} the concerned boat, aircraft, and/or persons.|$|R
