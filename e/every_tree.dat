5|$|Although {{the storm}} {{affected}} several countries along its path, Waka left {{the most significant}} losses in Tonga, where it killed one person and wrought 104.2million paʻanga ($51.3million USD) in damage. Hundreds of structures, including 200 in the island's largest city, {{and much of the}} nation's agriculture were destroyed. Winds in excess of 185km/h (115mph) battered Vava'u, defoliating nearly <b>every</b> <b>tree</b> on the island. In addition to infrastructural and public losses, the environment was also severely affected; a native species of bat lost roughly 80% of its population {{due to the lack of}} fruit. Following the storm, Tonga requested international aid to cope with the scale of damage. Due to the severity of damage, the name Waka was later retired and replaced with Wiki. According to a study by Janet Franklin et al., storms similar in intensity to Waka, on average, strike Tonga once every 33years.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{reports from}} Nukuʻalofa on December31 {{indicated}} severe agricultural damage but few infrastructural losses. Following {{the passage of}} Waka, communication with Niuas and Vava'u were lost. According to local reports, high winds sandblasted Neiafu and downed nearly <b>every</b> <b>tree.</b> Surveys by the Red Cross revealed that roughly 200 homes in the city were severely damaged or destroyed and those left standing lost their roofs. Vava'u lost roughly 90% of its crops, including essential food crops such as taro, yams and bananas. In Ha'apai, one person died from cardiac arrest {{brought on by the}} storm. Fallen trees blocked numerous roads; power and water supplies were also interrupted to most residents. Severe damage also took place on Niuatoputapu where coastal homes were impacted by Waka's storm surge and several structures lost their roofs. In one instance, a yacht was brought onshore by the surge and crashed into a restaurant, destroying both.|$|E
