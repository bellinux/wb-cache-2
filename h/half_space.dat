25|$|Automorphic {{forms are}} a {{generalization}} of modular forms to more general analytic functions, perhaps of several complex variables, with similar transformation properties. The generalization involves replacing the modular group PSL2 (R) and a chosen congruence subgroup by a semisimple Lie group G and a discrete subgroup Γ. Just as modular forms {{can be viewed}} as differential forms on a quotient of the upper <b>half</b> <b>space</b> H = PSL2 (R)/SO(2), automorphic forms {{can be viewed as}} differential forms (or similar objects) on Γ\G/K, where K is (typically) a maximal compact subgroup of G. Some care is required, however, as the quotient typically has singularities. The quotient of a semisimple Lie group by a compact subgroup is a symmetric space and so the theory of automorphic forms is intimately related to harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces.|$|E

40|$|Recently {{dictionary}} screening {{has been}} proposed as {{an effective way to}} improve the computational efficiency of solving the lasso problem, {{which is one of the}} most commonly used method for learning sparse representations. To address today's ever increasing large dataset, effective screening relies on a tight region bound on the solution to the dual lasso. Typical region bounds are in the form of an intersection of a sphere and multiple <b>half</b> <b>spaces.</b> One way to tighten the region bound is using more <b>half</b> <b>spaces,</b> which however, adds to the overhead of solving the high dimensional optimization problem in lasso screening. This paper reveals the interesting property that the optimization problem only depends on the projection of features onto the subspace spanned by the normals of the <b>half</b> <b>spaces.</b> This property converts an optimization problem in high dimension to much lower dimension, and thus sheds light on reducing the computation overhead of lasso screening based on tighter region bounds...|$|R
