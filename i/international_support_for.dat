5|$|Miguel feigned {{compliance}} with PedroI's plans. As {{soon as he}} was declared regent in early 1828, and backed by Carlota Joaquina, he abrogated the Constitution and, supported by those Portuguese in favor of absolutism, was acclaimed King Dom MiguelI. As painful as was his beloved brother's betrayal, PedroI also endured the defection of his surviving sisters, Maria Teresa, Maria Francisca, Isabel Maria and Maria da Assunção, to MiguelI's faction. Only his youngest sister, Ana de Jesus, remained faithful to him, and she later traveled to Rio de Janeiro to be close to him. Consumed by hatred and beginning to believe rumors that MiguelI had murdered their father, PedroI turned his focus on Portugal and tried in vain to garner <b>international</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> MariaII's rights.|$|E
5|$|Norway was {{prior to}} 1920 {{extremely}} active in gaining <b>international</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Norwegian sovereignty, but following the treaty, Norwegian {{interest in the}} archipelago dwindled. From {{the start of the}} Cold War, Norwegian politicians wanted to avoid bringing the islands into superpower politics. This resulted in a policy of avoiding agitating the Soviet Union, which again resulted in the Norwegian authorities actively working against both Norwegian and foreign activities on Svalbard which could raise tensions. Compared to mainland relations, which were dominated by deterring through NATO membership, the Norwegian policy on Svalbard was related to calming the Soviet Union. Similarly, while a foreign presence was encouraged on the mainland, it was strongly discouraged on Svalbard.|$|E

In addition, an Inter-Ministry Committee was established with Niam Chiang Meng, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports as its chairman. Singapore also received some <b>international</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the Games preparations. The People's Republic of China, host of the 2008 Summer Olympics, expressed its desire to assist Singapore in its preparations. Sebastian Coe, Lord Coe, Chairman of the London Organising Committee for the 2012 Summer Olympics, announced that members of his organising team, including coaches and administrators, planned to attend the event. The Bid Committee secured 4,310 guaranteed rooms in 36 hotels. The official hotel partner for the Games was the Fairmont Singapore.|$|E

5|$|González-Gordon was {{involved}} with conservationism from an early age; {{he was also an}} avid bird watcher and would become an ornithologist. His family estate was located in the Coto Doñana, a wetland {{at the mouth of the}} river Guadalquivir, near Jerez de la Frontera, in southern Spain. Here González-Gordon became interested in the local ecosystem and invited European ornithologists to visit the area. When two Spanish ornithologists, Professor Francisco Bernis and José Antonio Valverde visited, González-Gordon served as their guide. The González-Gordon family saw that the wetlands were threatened by the planting of eucalyptus trees and large-scale drainage plans proposed by the government. Mauricio, together with his father, asked Bernis to try and influence Spanish dictator Francisco Franco into abandoning these proposals. The trio wrote a memorandum which was presented to Franco himself by Mauricio's father Manuel. By November 1953, Bernis had finished a report on the value of the Doñana, which showed that the area had exceptional ecological value. The group sought <b>international</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> their goals and found it. The efforts of González-Gordon to dissuade Franco exposed him to some danger, but the Franco government conceded and the drainage plans were aborted.|$|E
5|$|In 1830, the Belgian {{provinces of}} the Netherlands revolted in the Belgian Revolution and {{declared}} their independence. Despite widespread <b>international</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Belgian independence, fighting between Belgium and the Netherlands continued {{under the rule}} of King Leopold I. Belgian independence was finally recognized by the Dutch in 1839. Under Leopold I's reign, Belgium remained relatively stable and was only lightly affected by the Revolutions of 1848. On his death in 1865, his son Leopold II was inaugurated as King. Leopold II's reign was dominated by the rise of the Socialist party and calls for reform to the voting system and military as well as the Schools' War between Liberal and Catholic political factions. Although Belgian independence was briefly threatened during the Franco-Prussian War, under Leopold II's reign the country reached an unprecedented level of industrialization and prosperity, becoming the second most industrialized state in the world after Great Britain. The period was also marked by the creation of a personal colony by Leopold II, the Congo Free State. The subsequent international outcry over human rights abuses forced the Belgian state to annex the region in 1908, forming the Belgian Congo. In 1909, after his uncle's death, Albert I began his reign, which lasted until 1934. In the years leading up to the First World War, the process of military and voting reform begun in the 1880s was finally completed. Despite declaring neutrality, Belgium was invaded by the German Empire in August 1914, beginning the country's involvement in World War I.|$|E

The most widely publicized commentary on John Brown to reach American from Europe was a 1861 pamphlet entitled John Brown par Victor Hugo which included a brief biography and reprinted two letters written by Hugo, including that of December 9, 1859. The frontispiece of the pamphlet was an engraving of a hanged man by Hugo, which became famously associated with the execution.|$|E

Returning to China, he purchased several surplus military aircraft and created the Civil Air Transport, (later known as Air America). These aircraft facilitated aid to Nationalist China during the struggle against Chinese Communists in the late 1940s, and were later used in supply missions to French forces in Indochina and the Kuomintang occupation of northern Burma throughout the mid- and late-1950s, providing support for the Thai police force.

25|$|Honduran leaders {{refused to}} {{reinstate}} Zelaya before the elections, and <b>international</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the elections remained scant {{leading up to}} the polls. Many Hondurans sought to move past the crisis with the elections, which had been scheduled previous to Zelaya's ouster. While Zelaya had urged abstention from the vote, initial returns indicated a larger than usual turnout, around 60%, a figure which was subsequently revised downward to 49%. Zelaya also disputed those figures at the time. Some Honduran activists have ended daily protests demanding the reinstatement of Zelaya since he was ousted in a coup, saying they are moving on since Congress had voted to keep Manuel Zelaya out of office.|$|E
25|$|By 1961, the Netherlands {{government}} {{was struggling to}} find adequate <b>international</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> its policy to prepare West New Guinea for independent status under Dutch guidance. While the Netherlands' traditional Western allies—the United States, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand—were sympathetic to Dutch policy, they were unwilling to provide any military support {{in the event of}} conflict with Indonesia. On 26 September 1961, the Dutch Foreign Minister Joseph Luns offered to hand over West New Guinea to a United Nations trusteeship. This proposal was firmly rejected by his Indonesian counterpart Subandrio, who likened the West New Guinea dispute to Katanga's attempted secession from the Republic of Congo during the Congo Crisis. By October 1961, Britain was open to transferring West New Guinea to Indonesia while the United States floated the idea of a jointly-administered trusteeship over the territory.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Zulfikar Bhutto {{was overthrown}} in a {{military}} coup led by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the Chief of Army Staff. In July, Zia declared Pakistan to be under martial law. Zulfikar was then {{arrested and charged with}} the murder of Muhammad Ahmed Khan Kauri. After the coup, Bhutto's brothers were sent abroad to canvass <b>international</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> their father. Bhutto and her mother remained in Pakistan, although they were repeatedly detained for short periods. When she was able, Bhutto visited her father in prison. She also assisted in the preparation of his defence case, which was put before first the Lahore High Court, which sentenced him to death, and then the Supreme Court, which upheld that decision. Just before his execution, Zulfikar urged his wife and daughter to leave Pakistan, but they refused. He was executed in April 1979. Bhutto and Nusrat were then imprisoned for six months, before being released and placed under house arrest for a further six months. The pair were only fully released in April 1980.|$|E
40|$|This proposal’s key {{premise is}} the {{importance}} – and urgency – of creating favorable conditions for sustainable FDI flows to meet future investment needs. Governments must muster {{the political will to}} put an <b>international</b> <b>support</b> program <b>for</b> sustainable investment facilitation in place. Transitioning to a carbon-free world economy and meeting the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 requires, annually, trillions of dollars. Massive private investment, including foreign direct investment (FDI), has to be mobilized for this purpose. However, developing countries, especially the least developed countries, simply lack the capacity to compete successfully in the highly competitive FDI world market to obtain the required funds. They need assistance – not only to obtain more FDI but sustainable FDI. What is needed, therefore, is an <b>international</b> <b>support</b> program <b>for</b> sustainable investment facilitation...|$|R
