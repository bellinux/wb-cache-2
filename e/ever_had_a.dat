5|$|Nobel laureates {{receive a}} diploma {{directly}} {{from the hands of}} the King of Sweden, {{or in the case of}} the peace prize, the Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureates that receive them. The diploma contains a picture and text in Swedish which states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize. None of the Nobel Peace Prize laureates has <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> citation on their diplomas.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Pedro del Valle (1893–1978) was the {{commanding}} officer of the 11th Marine Regiment (artillery). Upon the outbreak of World War II, del Valle led his regiment during the seizure and defense of Guadalcanal, providing artillery support for the 1st Marine Division. In the Battle of the Tenaru, the firepower provided by del Valle's artillery units killed many assaulting Japanese soldiers—almost to the last man—before they reached the Marine positions. As {{a result of the}} outcome of the battle the Japanese commander, Colonel Kiyonao Ichiki, committed seppuku shortly afterwards. General Alexander Vandegrift, impressed with del Valle's leadership, recommended his promotion and on October 1, 1942, del Valle became a brigadier general. Vandegrift retained del Valle as head of the 11th Marines, the only time that the 11th Marines has <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> general as their commanding officer. In 1943, he served as commander of Marine Forces overseeing Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and the Russell and Florida Islands. Sergeant Silvio Sanguedolce was awarded the Navy Cross for their actions in Guadalcanal.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{relationship}} between Cohn, McCarthy and Schine remains unknown. Cohn and Schine were certainly close, {{and rather than}} work out of the Senate offices, the two rented nearby office space and shared bills. McCarthy commented that Cohn was unreasonable in matters dealing with Schine. It is unclear if Schine <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> romantic or sexual relationship with Cohn, who was a closeted homosexual. (Three years after the hearings, Schine married and eventually had six children.) Some have also suggested that McCarthy may have been homosexual, and even possibly involved with Schine or Cohn.|$|E

25|$|Torosaurus was a herbivorous dinosaur {{that lived}} during the Late Cretaceous Period about 70 {{million years ago}} {{in what is now}} North America. Torosaurus had an {{enormous}} head that measured 8 feet (2.5 m) in length. Its skull {{is one of the largest}} know up to date, no other land animal has <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> skull larger than Torosaurus. Torosaurus frill made up about one-half the total skull length. The first fossils of Torosaurus were discovered in 1889, in Wyoming by John Bell Hatcher. The American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh would later name the specimen Torosaurus latus, in recognition of the bull-like size of its skull and its large eyebrow horns. Ever since, the specimen has been in display at the Peabody Museum in New Haven, Connecticut.|$|E

He did not allow anyone else in or near the house, and kept his gun nearby in case someone did come. No one in the neighborhood knew about the abuse Genie's father carried out on his family, or was aware that Genie's parents <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> child besides their son. Throughout this time, Genie's father kept detailed notes chronicling his mistreatment of his family and his efforts to conceal it.|$|E

25|$|A later {{study from}} 2000-2003 showed that bowling actions that looked normal {{to the naked}} eye in many of the world's elite fast bowlers had, on average, 9 degrees of elbow {{extension}} during the bowling action. Some recorded elbow extension measuring between 10-15 degrees, yet none of these bowlers had <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> problem regarding the legality of their bowling action. This testing showed that a zero tolerance threshold, and the tiered thresholds implemented in the late 1990s, had no or little scientific merit. The study, conducted by the Australian Institute of Sport Biomechanics department, led by cricket biomechanist Dr. Marc Portus, involved taking three-dimensional video based biomechanical analyses during tour, test and one-day international matches in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. Results from this work indicated that video based measurement error in such a scenario, using best practice methodologies, was 3 degrees. This report was submitted to the ICC in 2003, which instigated the review of the illegal action definition and processes.|$|E
25|$|The Nets {{were founded}} as WTT's charter {{franchise}} for Cincinnati, Ohio in 1973, by Bill DeWitt, Jr. and Brian Heekin. Within weeks of being established, {{and before the}} team <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> name in Cincinnati, DeWitt and Heekin sold it to Cleveland radio executive Joseph Zingale who paid them the same $50,000 as the franchise fee they had paid to WTT. Zingale relocated the team to Cleveland {{with a plan to}} have it play its home matches at the Cleveland Public Hall starting with the league's inaugural 1974 season and name it the Cleveland Nets. Before the draft, Zingale spoke to Clark Graebner, a native of Cleveland, about playing for the team as well as to being its coach and general manager. Graebner insisted his wife, Carole, had to be drafted by the team as well. The Nets selected them both as a pair in the fourth round of the draft. No other WTT team objected to the Nets selecting two players with one draft choice. When Clark and Carole Graebner separated, Clark traded Carole to the Pittsburgh Triangles. The couple never divorced, and Carole Graebner died in 2008. Peaches Bartkowicz was a key women's doubles player for the 1974 Nets but quit the team during the season. Through all the drama, the Nets finished with 21 wins and 23 losses, third in the Atlantic Section and snuck into the playoffs.|$|E
