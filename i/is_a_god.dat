5000|$|The {{context of}} the novel - modern western {{characters}} in a Hindu-Buddhist-infused world - {{is reflected in the}} book's opening lines: His followers called him Mahasamatman and said he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>god.</b> He preferred to drop the - and the -atman, however, and called himself Sam. He never claimed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>god,</b> but then he never claimed not to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>god.</b>|$|R

5|$|Let {{it not be}} concluded, that I wish {{to invert}} the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the {{constitution}} of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain {{a greater degree of}} virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>God.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the Powhatan River, Smith, Rolfe, Percy, Walter, Larry, Robin, and Alice {{disembark}} from a barge as {{the chorus}} of soldiers and adventurers sing about the joy of reaching the shore. Larry, Walter, Alice (Walter’s wife), and Robin reminisce about love, and Robin admits to Larry his lustful feelings about Alice. Meanwhile, Nima is preparing a bridal gown for Pocahontas in the royal village of Werocomoco, but Pocahontas expresses displeasure about the arrangement her father made for her to marry Miami, a rival Indian prince. Smith is then attacked by a party of Indians, including Nantaquas, Pocahontas’s brother. Due to his fighting prowess, Nantaquas thinks he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>god,</b> but Smith explains he is only a trained warrior from across the sea. The Indians capture Smith {{to bring him to}} their chief. Back at the Powhatan River, Robin attempts to seduce Alice, but is foiled by Walter and Larry. When Walter tells the group about Smith’s capture, they depart to go after him. Before they leave, Rolfe tries to convince Percy to move on after his lover, Geraldine, apparently was unfaithful.|$|E
5|$|Using ten {{orichalcum}} beads at a {{time would}} enable them to control the water with the powers they gained, keeping the sea level down to prevent an impending catastrophe. Unknowingly, Indiana starts the machine with the stones, upon which Kerner, Ubermann, and the Nazi troops invade the place and announce their intention to use the machine to become gods. The machine was responsible for creating the mutated skeletons seen earlier, but the Nazis believe that it will work on them due to their Aryan qualities. Ubermann wants to use Jones as a test subject, but Kerner steps onto the platform first, claiming himself to be most suitable for godhood. Just as Ubermann wants to start the machine, Jones mentions Plato's tenfold error, which convinces Kerner to use one bead instead of ten. He is then turned into a horribly deformed and horned creature, and falls into the lava. Indiana is forced to step on the platform next but threatens Ubermann with eternal damnation once he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>god.</b> Fearing his wrath, Ubermann uses the machine on himself, feeding it one hundred beads. He is turned into a green ethereal being, but his form becomes unstable and he flies apart with an agonized scream.|$|E

He <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>God</b> Seed.|$|E
5000|$|The idiomatic {{interpretation}} of bhavissati can also refer to some uncertainty which <b>is</b> present. Thus, <b>a</b> translation which would interpret the future tense as indicative of some {{uncertainty in the}} questioner, the question might be translated as [...] "Whether the Buddha 'might' or 'would' <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>god,</b> <b>a</b> gandharva, a yaksha or a human". The answer would {{be put in the}} same way as the reply, giving the answer that [...] "I might not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>god,</b> gandharva, yaksha or human", or [...] "I would not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>god,</b> gandharva, yaksha or human", though this rendering is liable to other undesirable interpretations.|$|R

25|$|Today, theism {{is losing}} {{prevalence}} in Europe {{in favour of}} atheism and agnosticism, and religion is losing prevalence in favour of secularism.

25|$|In 2007, Flew {{published}} a book titled There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>God,</b> which was listed as having Roy Abraham Varghese as its co-author. Shortly after the book was released, the New York Times {{published a}}n article by religious historian Mark Oppenheimer, who stated that Varghese had been almost entirely responsible for writing the book, and that Flew was in a serious state of mental decline, having great difficulty remembering key figures, ideas, and events relating to the debate covered in the book. His book praises several philosophers (like Brian Leftow, John Leslie and Paul Davies), but Flew failed to remember their work during Oppenheimer's interview.|$|E

25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>God</b> in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E
