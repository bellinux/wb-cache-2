40|$|ABSTRACT: Indentation {{tests are}} used to detail {{firmness}} profiles from <b>intertidal</b> creek <b>deposits</b> and wave-exhumed substrates at Willapa Bay. Both of these sedimentological settings are characterized by occur-rences of modern Glossifungites assemblages. Firm substrates associ-ated with the intertidal-creek deposits are derived from dewatered modern sediments, whereas firmgrounds associated with wave erosion consist of dewatered and compacted Pleistocene strata. The Pleistocene firmgrounds are notably firmer than those derived from modern de-posits. A strong correlation between sediment firmness and burrowing behavior is evident in these deposits. In tidal-creek systems, the comparatively firm cutbank is character-ized by unlined, large-diameter, open burrows that form a Glossifun-gites assemblage. <b>Intertidal</b> point-bar <b>deposits</b> contain a softground suite consisting of mucous-lined, small-diameter, dominantly vertical traces.

On {{the strength of this}} evidence, a sea level highstand more than 20 m higher than present-day MSL was inferred for the MIS 11 interglacial, despite a lack of clear supporting evidence in the oxygen-isotope records of deep-sea sediment cores. We have critically re-examined the elevated marine deposits in Bermuda, and find their geological setting, sedimentary relations, and microfaunal assemblages to be inconsistent with intertidal deposition over an extended period. Rather, these deposits, which comprise a poorly sorted mixture of reef, lagoon and shoreline sediments, appear to have been carried tens of meters inside karst caves, presumably by large waves, at some time earlier than ca. 310 – 360 ka before present (MIS 9 – 11). We hypothesize that these deposits are the result of a large tsunami during the mid-Pleistocene, in which Bermuda was impacted by a wave set that carried sediments from the surrounding reef platform and nearshore waters over the eolianite atoll. Likely causes for such a megatsunami are the flank collapse of an Atlantic island volcano, such as the roughly synchronous Julan or Orotava submarine landslides in the Canary Islands, or a giant submarine landslide on the Atlantic continental margin...|$|R

In particular, the paper scrutinizes in situ log-grounds from two intertidal zones situated immediately seaward of low-lying, supratidal, forested marshlands that are fed by small streams. Vestiges of remnant marshes and streams are preserved on intertidal flats as in-situ roots, broken stumps, strewn logs, abundant organic detritus, and organic sandy mud. Xylic material and organic sedi-ment were {{deposited in the}} supratidal marshes: tide and wave processes truncated the swamps, exposing in situ tree-root networks and the lowermost supratidal sediments. Stream and swamp deposits overlie and incise older Pleis-tocene strata. Both units are overlain by discontinuous, modern <b>intertidal</b> <b>deposits.</b> The intertidally exposed stumps and logs support a di-verse community of animal and plant life. Boring organ-isms, encrusters, and refugium seekers are found on and within the xylic substrates.

40|$|Monitoring of {{sedimentation}} {{and erosion}} {{was conducted on}} an open coastal tidal flat on the southern flank of the Yangtze delta. Various elevation references were established in the intertidal zone and monitored intensively for 4 months {{in order to examine}} fortnightly and seasonal (calm weather and storm season) sedimentation and erosion. Longer term (100 years) sedimentation and preservation were investigated through examination of cores and trenches. Two different vertical grouping patterns of tidal bedding were distinguished with thinner and thicker sandy laminae. The number of sand-dominated layers and individual muddy and sandy lamina in the cores were compared with theoretically derived sedimentation rates in order to assess long-term preservation potential. Waves, especially high storm waves, have a significant influence on sedimentation and the preservation of <b>intertidal</b> <b>deposits</b> along the open-coast tidal flat. Monitoring during one season indicated that the sand-dominated layer was directly related to storm deposits, while the mud-dominated layer was deposited during calm weather conditions. The variation in sandy lamina thickness was not related to spring–neap tidal cycles during the monitoring period. The assumption of 100 % preservation of sandy laminae deposited during every tidal cycle, which has been assumed in previous time-series analyses for the identification of palaeotidal periodicity, was found to be unrealistic along this open-coast tidal flat. Preservation potential decreases as temporal scale increases. During one neap–spring tidal cycle, the preservation potential of individual sandy and muddy laminae was of the order of 10 %. Over a period of 100 years, the estimated preservation potential of individual laminae, including both calm weather and storm deposits, decreased to 0 · 2 %. The 100 -year preservation potential of storm-induced, sand-dominated layers was estimated to be of the order of 10 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{concerns}} the morphological (bed level) behaviour of the intertidal mudflat at Portishead on the Severn Estuary and discusses how the prevailing hydraulic and cohesive sediment processes contribute to bserved {{changes in the}} bed level. The characteristics of the mudflat behaviour d ing a fortnightly cycle is presented, based upon a continuous high resolution time series of the bed level measured at one location during 31 tidal immersions. During spring tides the sediment supply to the mudflat is increased and the tidal-mean bed elevation is at least 10 mm higher following the peak of spring tides than on the previous or following neaps. On a tide by tide basis the bed level varies by 10 - 20 mm and the preservation of fresh mud <b>deposits</b> on the <b>intertidal</b> area {{is controlled by the}} hydraulic onditions prevailing during the shallow water phase of the tide (less than 0. 5 m depth) and the processes operating during the dry part of the tide. Hence, the bed level is controlled by the phasing of the tidal range (ambient sediment supply) with local water depth and wave activity. In comparison, on the annual timescale the bed level variation on the middle and upper mudflat is of the order of 100 mm and seasonal changes in storminess, ubaerial environment and biostabilization appear to play a significant role. Quantitative methods of predicting the surface elevation of sub-tidal and intertidal areas in muddy estuaries and coasts are required to en-able effective management s rategies and engin-eering design.

The studied deposits crop out along the NW Sardinia coast were dated with Optically Stimulated Luminescence on both quartz and k-feldspar grains. The Quaternary successions were grouped in four major stratigraphic units mainly represented by shallow marine coastal dunes and alluvial systems, spanning from MIS 6 to MIS 4. Stratigraphic and chronologic data allow some considerations on climate changes occurred within the last interglacial (MIS 5) to the early glacial phase (MIS 4, post 80 ka). The last interglacial MIS 5 (130 - 80 ka) is subdivided in five substages (e-a) and MIS 5 e (Eemian) is considered the climatic optimum. During the MIS 5 e sea level was + 46 m higher than today and climate conditions were warmer and more humid. The NW Sardinia coast paleogeography was dominated by wave cut platforms colonized by carbonate <b>intertidal</b> <b>deposits</b> (algal rim) and small gravelly to mixed sandy-gravelly pocket beaches which developed {{at the base of the}} cliff-wall.

This project investigated factors influencing the relative abundance of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) in intertidal estuarine sediments. The effects of physical, biogeochemical and biological sediment characteristics, environmental variables and native microbial communities were explored through field campaigns on the Ythan and Eden estuaries, Scotland. The contributory role of sediments to adverse water quality was investigated by combining FIO abundance and measurements of sediment stability. The importance of strain and sediment characteristics in the adhesion of E. coli to suspended sediments was also examined using laboratory experiments. E. coli concentrations up to 5. 9 log₁₀ CFU 100 g dry wt⁻¹ were observed, confirming that intertidal sediments are an important reservoir of faecal bacteria. The variability of E. coli abundance in estuarine sediments was successfully explained with multiple stepwise linear regression (Adjusted R² up to 87. 4) using easily-obtainable measurements of sediment characteristics and environmental variables, with variability most heavily influenced by salinity and particle size gradients. Native microbial community population metrics and community constituent composition correlated with environmental gradients, but did not influence FIO abundance. The amount of E. coli adhering to suspended sediments ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 74 log₁₀ CFU ml⁻¹, and was dependant on strain characteristics and sediment type rather than zeta potential, with higher cell-particle adhesion at 2 and 3. 5 PSU than 0 and 5 PSU. Monitoring of sediment characteristics will lead to more informed bathing water quality advisories to protect public health.

Detailed georeferenced substrate mapping revealed extensive subtidal microbial deposits occupying approximately 300 km 2 of the total Holocene 1400 km 2 area of Hamelin Pool. The Microbial Pavement covers 227 km 2 of the subtidal substrate that together with columnar structures reveals a subtidal microbial habitat which occupies an area 10 times larger than the area of the <b>intertidal</b> <b>deposits.</b> Microbial carbonate is composed of aragonite (80 – 98 %) that reveals high positive values of δ 13 C (+ 4. 46 to + 5. 88) and δ 18 O (+ 3. 06 to + 3. 88) as a characteristic of the highly evaporative environment with extensive microbial activity. Oldest dated heads are 1915 and 1680 14 C years BP, and the overall system was deposited in two stages; the first between 2000 and 1200 and the last from 900 years BP to the present.

40|$|Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 was {{possibly}} the longest (∼ 423, 000 – 362, 000 yr ago) and warmest interglacial {{of the entire}} Quaternary Period. This resulted from a special arrangement of Earth 2 ̆ 7 s orbital parameters-similar to the present interglacial (MIS 1) -suggesting that MIS 11 provides an analogue for future natural climate forcing and sea levels. Although precise documentation of MIS 11 sea level history is, therefore, crucial – especially considering additional impetus from anthropogenic warming – the maximum MIS 11 sea level remains highly contentious. Estimates from onshore indicators have ranged from below present sea level to about + 20 m, resulting from uncertainties in reliability of sea level indicators, estimates of their subsequent displacement by vertical crustal motion and in dating. We used a clear and unambiguous sea level indicator (interface between subtidal and <b>intertidal</b> <b>deposits)</b> in well exposed, regressive raised shoreline deposits along South Africa 2 ̆ 7 s southern coast. The coast is stable in terms of tectonic setting and falls within a zone of low predicted glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA) and low sensitivity for plausible model parameters. The sea level indicators were directly dated using thermally transferred optically stimulated luminescence (TT-OSL), which gave {{a mean age of}} ∼ 390 ka, corresponding with MIS 11. We determined a precise maximum elevation of + 14 m for the MIS 11 sea level indicator, which corrected for minor crustal uplift and GIA yielded a eustatic sea level of + 13 m ± 2 m. The complete MIS 11 transgressive/regressive shoreline succession is preserved and the wave-cut platform extends 950 m inland from the present shoreline, indicating a prolonged highstand. We have also documented sea level fluctuations during MIS 11, including an earlier (lower) highstand close to present sea level, which may explain the lower elevation range of some previous estimates. At one locality, MIS 11 deposits form a sea cliff against which MIS 5 e sediments (at an elevation of + 6. 2 m) abut.

40|$|This study {{constitutes}} the first reconstruction of Pleistocene palaeoenvironmental {{change from the}} Gordano Valley, a low-lying valley marginal to the Severn Estuary in southwest England. The valley lies at the limit of Pleistocene glacial expansion and the threshold of terrestrial, marine and fluvial environments. An axial alignment opposite {{to that of the}} Severn Estuary provides a regionally unique preservational environment for valley floor Pleistocene sediments. These sediments potentially contain an important archive of palaeoenvironmental information yet they have received limited attention from previous researchers. Data from 489 manual cores are used to determine the aerial extent, surface morphology and geometry of the uppermost minerogenic sediments. These reveal a patchwork of sands, silts and gravels with a hummocky surface topography and a central basin or channel. Stratigraphic, sedimentological and palaeontological analysis of eight percussion cores reveals thinly bedded, very poorly sorted gravel, silt and sand units with an altitude range of c. - 2. 5 to + 3 m OD. Two units record abundant temperate freshwater and intertidal fossil material. Using a multi-faceted methodology, detailed analysis of relatively small volumes of material from core samples of the Gordano Valley’s minerogenic sediment archive has identified complex sequences of depositional and post-depositional environmental change. The sediments are characterised as representing a range of Pleistocene palaeohydrological environments interspersed with a number of periods of non-deposition, and involving a number of processes (aeolian, colluvial, pedogenetic, various fluvial, intertidal). Radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence dating and amino acid geochronology indicate Mid-to-Late Pleistocene deposition. A revised model of the Pleistocene Gordano Valley, presented here, suggests a landscape in which alluvial fans formed close to the valley margins and freshwater streams and interconnected pools which were open to tidal influence formed along the valley axis. The elevation of <b>intertidal</b> <b>deposits</b> appears to provide terrestrial validation for a low late-MIS 7 sea-level, in terms of known global sea-level, without recourse to a regional uplift model.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{properties of}} surficial sedimentary deposits strongly influence exchange processes across the benthic boundary layer, and hence are important factors controlling sedimentation and biogeochemical cycling. They {{are governed by}} a complex combination of hydrodynamic, chemical and biological controls, and therefore exhibit significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Geophysical techniques have great potential as tools for investigation of these structural properties. Techniques for determining in situ Electrical Formation Factor (FF) and acoustic shear-wave velocity (Vs) in the upper few centimetres of saturated <b>intertidal</b> <b>deposits</b> were developed: FF was measured by a Wenner electrode array at the sediment surface; Vs was measured by piezoelectric bender transducers inserted {{to a depth of}} 40 mm. Geophysical properties, porosity, and textural and biological characteristics were determined in situ at a variety of locations, predominantly in sands. The highest variability in all parameters was obtained over large spatial scales, with primary variation in bulk textural composition and benthic infaunal community. Within-location variability was significant over medium spatial scales of tens to hundreds of metres, controlled by local variation in tide-averaged hydrodynamic environment and duration of tidal exposure. In sands, bulk textural variability was of secondary importance over these scales, and was interpreted as due to admixture of relatively small proportions of coarse and fine sub-populations into a uniform sedimentary framework. Localised geophysical variability, while significant, was also of secondary importance, being influenced primarily by properties of this framework. Seasonal variability was also significant, controlled by temporal variation in hydrodynamic environment and temperature. Structural parameters (porosity, FF, Vs) were more responsive than textural parameters to temporal variation in hydrodynamic or biological activity. Porosity was controlled by grain shape and size distribution, and by the depositional environment. It was not apparently directly affected by benthic macrofaunal activity. FF was controlled by porosity, and additionally by factors affecting tortuosity. Tortuosity was increased by increasing both carbonate and mud contents. Burrowing organisms (Arenicola marina and Corophium) and tube-building organisms (Lanice conchilega) reduced FF. Vs was controlled by porosity, and additionally by factors which control intergranular friction. This was increased by increasing carbonate content, and reduced by increasing mud content.

This study provides {{insights into the}} primary sedimentological and early alteration characteristics of an isolated fringing reef system (Kaledupa-Hoga) from the Tukang Besi Archipelago, SE Asia. A combined multispectral satellite imagery, field and petrographic study allowed for the generation of an environmental facies map, which acts {{as a model for}} the distribution of primary sedimentological characteristics in relation to the primary environmental facies. The islands of the Tukang Besi Archipelago are mesotidal ( 71 % accuracy when compared with field and sedimentary data. With the exception of the reef crest and reef slope that commonly have widths on a sub-imaging resolution (< 30 m), the facies map accurately demonstrates the heterogeneous nature of the carbonate system. Although field and satellite imagery observations reveal ten environmental facies, sedimentological characterisation results in a lower number of distinctive categories due to the similarity of many deposits. Foreshore/backshore and bare <b>intertidal</b> <b>deposits</b> are distinctive and are composed of reef-derived material that has been reworked shorewards. Seagrass-associated facies all show some fine silt-clay sized material (< 8 %) with common imperforate foraminifera and pervasive micritisation, but also contain high abundances of reworked coral and shell allochems. Coral-associated reef flat facies are typically low in imperforate but high in perforate foraminifera, and show lesser effects of bioerosion and very low silt contents. The reef slope and crest are characterised by high abundances of gravel-sized fragmented corals with the highest abundances of echinoderm material and alcyonarian sclerites. Sediment samples across all fringing reef environments from the Kaledupa-Hoga transects are characterised almost exclusively by grain-rudstone textures, with < 2 - 5 % silt and clay size fractions, and minor baffling of fines in seagrass-associated settings (grain-packstones). The paucity of fines across the fringing reef systems as a whole, and the degree of homogenisation of sediment characteristics across the different field- and satellite-identifiable environmental facies are attributed to: (1) high wave/current energies, (2) the small size of the islands rendering limited protection, (3) bidirectional monsoon winds and (4) the lack of reef rimmed margins built to sea level. Absent from these deposits are well developed high energy windward and low energy leeward deposit characteristics and/or an overriding hurricane influence that are commonly seen in fringing reef systems from other areas...|$|R
40|$|This Sheet Description {{describes}} the Quaternary and solid geology of the Gheweifat and As Sila 1 : 100 000 scale geological map. The oldest {{rocks in the}} area are the Miocene rocks of the Ras Khumeis, Dam, Shuwaihat and Baynunah formations. The Ras Khumeis and Dam formations (Gheweifat and Sila members) are spectacularly exposed across the headlands of Ras Khumeis, Ras Hayusa and Ras Mushairib and comprise variable proportions of grey and pinkish grey carbonate mudstones, shelly limestones, stromatolitic limestones and nodular gypsum beds. The carbonates are predominantly shallow marine but, particularly toward the top in the Sila Member, include rooted palaeosols, collapse breccias and freshwater faunas indicating periodic shifts to non-marine conditions. The overlying Shuwaihat Formation completes the transition to fully terrestrial environments and is characterised by grey and red sandstones and mudstones deposited in a range of aeolian, fluvial and sabkha environments. Quaternary and Holocene sediments are present throughout much of the area. Pale brown sands and gravels of Hofuf Formation rest unconformably on the Dam and Shuwaihat formations forming a 1 - 5 m thick cap on the As Sila-Gheweifat plateau. The gravels include quartzite, limestone and igneous clasts brought into the area by major river systems draining large parts of the Arabian Shield. Gravels of a comparable composition and grain-size occur at much lower altitudes to the east of Sabkha Mati where they form a thin scattered veneer called the Sabkha Mati Gravels. To the north and south of Ba’ya well-cemented pale brown shelly limestones up to 2 m thick form broad elevated platforms just above high water mark. These limestones are included with the Marawah Formation. The Abu Dhabi Formation is dominated by shelly beach ridges, <b>intertidal</b> <b>deposits</b> and algal mats which have accreted during a cycle of relative sea level rise and fall during the Holocene. These deposits underlie much of Sabkha Mati adjacent to the As Sila escarpment and occur in coastal embayments between the headlands in the north of the district.

5000|$|The {{climate is}} one of the main factors in sabkha development. Rainfall in this arid region usually occurs as {{thunderstorms}} and averages 4 cm/year. Temperatures can range in excess of 50 °C to as low as 0 °C. Humidity is linked to the wind direction, with humidity as low as 20% in the mornings from off the dry interior and building in the afternoon as a strong, onshore wind prevail. At night, relative humidity of 100% can lead to dense fogs. [...] Water temperatures vary by depth with shallow water as much as 10 °C warmer. These high temperatures drive high rates of evaporation in the Persian Gulf, as much as 124 cm/year leading salinity to increase in the shallow lagoons to as much as 70 ppt. The net rate of evaporation from the sabkha can be as much as an order of magnitude less and has averaged 6 cm for the last 4,000 to 5,000 years. The reasons for this are that the sabkha surface is not a free-water surface, the high humidity during the night, and vertical stratification of the air column. Despite the loss of water due to evaporation, the groundwater, never deeper than 1.5 m, flows seawards and is recharged by continental waters, rainstorms, and the northwest [...] "shamal” gale-force winds that create waves of greater height than the intertidal height and drive water as much as 5 km inland over the sabkha to a depth of a few centimeters. [...] The climate variations lead to the very dynamic nature of a sabkha. Halite is deposited on the surface of the sabkha and gypsum and aragonite precipitate in the subsurface via capillary action from brines brought up from the water table. In drier parts of the sabkha the gypsum can be altered to anhydrite and the aragonite can be dolomitized diagenetically. [...] Thermal contraction at night and expansion during the day leads to concave polygonal pans as the edges have been upturned, in part due to growth of evaporites wedging the crack apart. Below this is a gypsum mush where nodules of anhydrite and other sulfates may develop. These might also form a “chicken wire” crystalline structure. Below this are the <b>intertidal</b> <b>deposits</b> typified by laminated, organic-rich muds formed by the microbial mats that grade downward into more bioturbated muds.

On the open-coast intertidal flats of the Changjiang Delta large laterally migrating tidal channels are absent. Instead, numerous shallow tidal creeks cut across the intertidal flats. On these flats, vertical rather than lateral migration dominates sedimentation. Observations over semidiurnal tidal cycles show that both flood and ebb tides {{have the potential to}} deposit their own mud-sand copulets, but four couplets per day are rarely preserved. Reworking by tidal currents and/or weak waves results in loss of tidal couplets or amalgamation of two or more thin couplets into a single thick couplet. Measurements of preserved couplets show that they can represent a single flooding or ebbing event (half day) to a period of several neap-spring cycles. Diastems within amalgamated couplets are generally not distinguishable. The key agent for reworking open-coast <b>intertidal</b> flat <b>deposits</b> is not tidal creek migration but seasonal storm waves. Seasonal storm deposits consist of a basal scour and sand-dominant laminae with mud pebbles, grading upward to mud-dominated layers of fair-weather deposits. Sand-dominated layers are also reworked...|$|R
40|$|Diatom and {{radiocarbon}} data of two cores {{from the}} north-eastern {{part of the}} western Belgian coastal plain are discussed. The palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of these sites and additional stratigraphic and geochronological information, allow {{an assessment of the}} general development of this region throughout the Holocene. Prior to c. 7500 yrs cal. BP a rapidly transgressing coast exists. Basal peat development may have been fairly wide­spread. Extensive erosion channels form towards the interior once the volume of the developing tidal basin has in­creased sufficiently. In spite of very high rates of sediment accumulation, high-intertidal environments remain poorly developed due to the high rate of RSL rise and the relatively steep slope of the transgressed terrain. Diatom taphocoenoses of this period consist primarily of coastal tychoplankton (mainly Cymatosira belgica), deposited in association with flood transported sediment, and some epipsammon. Hereafter, the incidence of negative tendencies in marine influence increases, culminating between c. 6300 to 5600 yrs cal. BP. Diatom assemblages are now more varied with an improved representation of tidal flat and salt marsh communities. The marine species Paralia sulcata and Pseudopodosira westii become abundant in high <b>intertidal</b> <b>deposits,</b> which may involve selective transport, sedi­mentation and preservation mechanisms. In general, the environmental changes reflect the development of a broad intertidal sedimentation zone in which sediment supply remained high, combined with a gradual slowing down of the RSL rise. Coastal progradation finally leads to sufficiently sheltered conditions for long-lasting peat growth in the intracoastal area up to perhaps c. 2100 yrs cal. BP Presumably a coastal barrier, which remains intersected by some inlets, also develops during this period. At places, peat growth is interrupted at about 4200 yrs cal. BP by a marked but short-lived period of marine sedimentation. Within the general framework of a return to a transgressive setting and a déstabilisation of the barrier system due to a decreasing sediment supply, climatic conditions and human interference may {{have played a role in}} the final termination of peat growth and the resumption of tidal activity. So far, the exact chronology of the return of tidal sedimentation in the study area remains unclear. No general sedimentation cycles, or so-called Dunkerque transgressions, are identified during the deposition of the upper tidal deposits, which are again characterized by a high representation of Cymatosira, reflecting a more open coastal setting. A tentative chronology of regional tendencies in the marine influence is derived from both bio- and lithostratigraphical indications and compared with the assumed chronology of transgressive and regressive phases in the northern Netherlands. Points of agreement are discussed in terms of possible supra-regional processes...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Holocene limestones on North Bimini and Joulter Cays (Bahamas) reveal {{sedimentary}} {{structures that}} are directly comparable to {{structures in the}} modern beach environment. A complete sequence comprises hallow subtidal, <b>intertidal,</b> and supratidal <b>deposits.</b> Holocane and equivalent modern sedimentary features are found on {{more or less the}} same topographic levels. Freshwater cementation (pbreatic and vadose) takes place after accretion and prngradation ofthe shore. Subsequent erosion exposes the consolidated sediments. Secondary cementation i the intertidal zone leads to beachrock formation. Continued erosion may break off blocks of beachrock and cliffs, which will be incorporated into the basal part of the sequence during a new phase of progradation. A freshwater-cemented s quence going from shallow subtidal to supratidal and eolian deposits does not, therefore, necessarily imply sea-level changes, but can be created by a cycle of progradation, cementation, and erosion...|$|R
40|$|Salt-marsh foraminifera {{have been}} used to {{reconstruct}} Holocene sea-level changes from coastlines around the world. In this work, we compile the results of surface foraminiferal surveys from fifteen study sites located on the east, south and west coasts of Great Britain, and the west coast of Ireland. These data, which comprise 236 samples and 84 species, are used to summarize the contemporary distributions of intertidal foraminifera around the British Isles, and to examine the environmental controls governing them. Seasonal and sub-surface foraminiferal data suggest that foraminiferal dead assemblages provide the most appropriate dataset for studying patterns of foraminiferal distributions in the context of sea-level reconstruction. In contrast to live populations or total assemblages, the dead assemblages are less affected by seasonal fluctuations and post-depositional modifications. Sub-surface foraminiferal data also indicate that foraminifera at the study sites live primarily in epifaunal habitats. Consequently, foraminiferal samples comprising the upper centimeter of sediment are appropriate analogues for the study of past sea-level change employing fossil assemblages contained within <b>intertidal</b> <b>deposits.</b> Surface dead assemblages from the fifteen study sites indicate a vertical zonation of foraminifera within British and Irish salt-marshes that is similar to those in other mid-latitude, cool temperate intertidal environments. Whilst the composition and vertical ranges of assemblage zones vary between sites, two general sub-divisions can be made: an agglutinated assemblage restricted to the vegetated marsh; and a high diversity calcareous assemblage that occupies the mudflats and sandflats of the intertidal zone. Three of the fifteen study sites permit further subdivision of the agglutinated assemblage into a high and middle marsh zone (Ia) dominated by Jadammina macrescens with differing abundances of Trochammina inflate and Miliammina fusca, and a low marsh zone (Ib) dominated by M. fusca. The calcareous assemblage is commonly comprised of Ammonia spp., Elphidium williamsoni and Haynesina germanica, in association {{with a wide range of}} minor taxa. The vertical zonations of the study areas suggest that the distribution of foraminifera in the intertidal zone is usually a direct function of elevation relative to the tidal frame, with the duration and frequency of intertidal exposure as the most important controlling factors. This relationship is supported by canonical correspondence analyses of the foraminiferal data and a series of environmental variables (elevation, pH, salinity, substrate and vegetation cover). These modern foraminiferal data are used to develop predictive transfer functions capable of inferring the past elevation of a sediment sample relative to the tidal frame from its fossil foraminiferal content. The results indicate that transfer functions perform most reliably when they are based on modern data collected from a wide range of intertidal environments. The careful combination of foraminiferal estimates of paleomarshsurface elevation with detailed lithostratigraphy and chronostratigraphy can produce high-resolution records of relative sea-level change with sufficient resolution to detect low-magnitude variability but long enough duration to reliably establish climate-ocean relationships and secular trends. Thus, the transfer function approach has the potential to link short-term instrumental and satellite records with established longer-term geologically based reconstructions of relative sea level...|$|R
40|$|Exposures of {{the middle}} Cambrian Potsdam Group of {{northern}} New York, including the type section, represent a suite of interfingering eolian dune and aquatic deposits that record the activities of early land-going arthropods. Quartz arenites at these exposures are dominantly fine to medium grained, well sorted, and have hematite-coated well-rounded, high-sphericity quartz grains characterized by secondary optically continuous quartz cement overgrowths. Eolian beds are laminated and dominated by m- to dm-scale foresets characterized by large-scale, laterally extensive cross-beds that dip., 156 – 346 and contain reverse-graded lamination, en-echelon microfaulted slumps, adhesion structures, and very high ripple-index asymmetric ripples that lie on the foresets with crests that trend downdip. Lower parts of foresets are interpreted as toesets, and contain unusual Diplichnites and Protichnites trackways, which record the uphill, downhill, crest-parallel, and switchback-style movement of arthropods in dry or damp sand. Trackways that ascend dune faces do not possess a medial tail drag, whereas trackways that descend do, and turns of trackways often have deep continuous medial impressions; these features suggest arthropods leaned into the slope when turning downhill in dry sand. More shallowly dipping (, 46 – 156) cross-beds are interpreted as bottomsets. Like nearby <b>intertidal</b> Potsdam <b>deposits,</b> these beds contain Protichnites trackways and Arenicolites burrows. Paleocurrent analyses imply a coastline in which offshore and mixed-direction winds moved dunes seaward. Considered together, these strata record migration of coastal dunes into aquatic environments and flooding and reworking of distal dune bottomsets. In this setting, the same suite of epifaunal arthropods inhabited dry, damp, and aquatic marine environments...|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} ichnofossils from Pleistocene outcrop at Willa-pa Bay are described. Because both trace fossils are char-acterized by an {{inclined}} to horizontal tunnel, are unlined, have an exaggerated J-shaped morphology, rarely branch, {{and have an}} unconstricted apertural opening, they have been classified as Psilonichnus upsilon Type A and B. Psilonichnus upsilon Type A is generally 1 to 3 cm in di-ameter and is infilled with laminated sediment. In general, P. upsilon Type A is observed in ancient point-bar deposits. It has an extremely simple architecture that is almost iden-tical to that produced by the crab Hemigrapsus oregonen-sis in modern tidal flats at Willapa Bay. Psilonichnus up-silon Type B normally exceeds 10 cm diameter and is infil-led with laminated sediment. The passive infill commonly is deposited in couplets and may be delivered to the burrow network by tide-generated currents. Psilonichnus upsilon Type B is observed in <b>intertidal</b> flat <b>deposits.</b> The overall morphology of this trace fossil is most similar to burrows generated by large crustaceans such as crabs, stomatopods, and lobsters. The occurrence of these traces leads to four findings: (1) Psilonichnus upsilon has a more variable architecture than discussed in the literature. The size and angle of the tunnel are variable, and Psilonichnus may aggrade, forming Tei-chichnus-like structures. (2) In the modern bay, burrowing shrimp dominate subtidal, point-bar, and intertidal depos-its. The Pleistocene record indicates that burrowing crabs sometimes occupied similar niches in the ancient bay. (3) Laminated, heterolithic burrow fills provide evidence of rhythmic sedimentation. These laminae represent tidal or episodic sedimentation and provide the only evidence of such processes in otherwise muddy deposits. (4) A large burrowing crab that might make P. upsilon Type B may not {{be present in the}} modern bay. However, such a trace maker was present when these Pleistocene deposits accumulated...|$|R
40|$|The Lower Muschelkalk crops {{out in the}} Catalan Coastal Ranges (the Catalan Basin) {{and eastern}} Iberian Ranges (the Valencia-Cuenca Basin) and occurs {{extensively}} in the subsurface of the Ebro Basin. The Lower Muschelkalk forms a carbonate platform that was deposited on red Buntsandstein siliciclastics and locally-developed evaporitic and calcareous shales. The Middle Muschelkalk rests with a sharp contact on the underlying Lower Muschelkalk and in contrast to it, exhibits marked regional thickness and facies variations. The Triassic of northeast Spain generally subsided during the Mesozoic and was uplifted during the early Paleogene. Tertiary subsidence was important in the Ebro Basin and the Neogene basins of the Catalan Coastal Ranges. The Lower Muschelkalk has a maximum thickness of about l(X) m in the Catalan Basin and southeastern Valencia-Cuenca Basin, but thins towards the northwest before pinching out completely. The {{lower part of the}} Lower Muschelkalk consists of peri tidal carbonates (El Brull Unit) passing upwards into bioclastic lagoonal sediments (Olesa Unit) and lagoonal to oolitic sand-belt deposits (Vilella Baixa Unit) interpreted as broadly transgressive sediments deposited on a homoclinal ramp which form a Transgressive Systems Tract (TST). The TST is overlain by locally-developed shallow subtidal to <b>intertidal</b> <b>deposits</b> and by <b>intertidal</b> to supra tidal dolomicrites (Lower Member and Upper Member of the Colldejou Unit). This aggradational to retrogradational package constitute a Highstand Systems Tract (HST). The Olesa Unit and Vilella Baixa Unit pinch out towards the northwest of the Valencia-Cuenca Basin and the Ebro Basin and the succession becomes dominated by peri tidal sediments. Lateral facies changes in the Olesa Unit and Vilella Baixa Unit indicate a downramp transition from northeast to southwest of the Catalan Basin. Paleokarstic surfaces are locally important in the Vilella Baixa Unit and the Lower Member of the Colldejou Unit and the underlying sediments appear to have been subjected to meteoric stabilization with early aragonite dissolution and replacement. These horizons have locally resisted later dolomitization. Subsurface paleokarsts are locally important in the Catalan Basin and may be related to Paleogene uplift and intraformational dissolution. Sulphates and evidence of former sulphates are common in the Lower Muschelkalk. Most sulphates were syndepositional but others were related to shallow-burial fabric-replacive dolomitization. Sulphate dissolution occurred in two phases; during burial diagenesis related to hydro thermal fluids; and in association with uplift into meteoric phreatic and vadose environments when dolomites suffered calcitization. Three types of dolomite are recognised in the Lower Muschelkalk: peritidal dolomite occurring in the Upper Member of the Colldejou Unit and in the peritidal facies of the El Brull Unit; fabric-replacive dolomite occurring in the TST; and baroque dolomite as a late cement and locally mosaic-forming phase. Trace element and isotope geochemistry indicates consistently greater depletion in strontium and (^ 18) O in the fabric-replacive dolomite than in the peritidal dolomite and differing trends in iron and manganese. These features are consistent with downwards-migrating fluids acting on contrasting precursors. The fabric-replacive dolomite and peritidal dolomite are considered to have formed as a result of Middle Muschelkalk evaporite-related brines migrating downwards through relatively homogeneous, unstable aragonite-rich peritidal sediments of the Colldejou Unit into more heterogeneous, partially stabilised calcitic limestones of the TST. Sequence stratigraphy allows easy comparison with other similar brine-reflux models of dolomitization. The baroque dolomite is geochemically distinct with depleted δ(^ 18) O values and high iron and manganese contents indicating precipitation at elevated temperatures from reducing fluids associated with local hydrothermal mineralization. Calcitization has locally affected the Lower Muschelkalk dolomites producing a wide variety of fabrics. Geochemistry and petrography indicate that dedolomitic calcite formed as a result of uplift- related dissolution of sulphates by near-surface, soil-influenced meteoric-derived groundwaters...|$|R
40|$|Deeply buried {{reservoirs}} represent interesting {{plays on}} the Norwegian Continental Shelf due to the efficiency of chlorite coatings as a porosity-preserving mechanism. This study investigates factors controlling reservoir quality of deeply buried middle – late Triassic sandstones in the Nordkapp Basin, Loppa High and Fingerdjupet Sub-basin in the southwestern Barents Sea. Special attention {{is given to the}} origin of the chlorite coating. Core material and well data from three wells was examined by sedimentological, petrographic and petrophysical methods. Sedimentological analysis was performed through core logging and facies division. Optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction and SEM provided the database for the petrographic analysis. Wireline logs were investigated during the petrophysical analysis. The sandstone of highest reservoir potential in the Kobbe Formation is interpreted as a tidally influenced fluvial channel in a protected, mesotidal estuary. Subaqueous infiltration of muddy water represents important emplacement of allogenic clay, of which a portion is adhered to the fine-grained detrital grains and forms a precursor clay coating. Small grain size is the major factor maintaining high IGV with increasing burial. Thin, iron-rich chlorite effectively prevents nucleation of quartz cement at greater depth intervals. The primary porosity is greatly reduced by the presence of pore filling clay matrix. Due to large volumetric potential and good petrographic properties, the interpreted <b>intertidal</b> bank <b>deposits</b> of the Snadd Formation show good reservoir quality. Mechanical clay infiltration in combination with subaerial exposure during low tide results in well-developed clay coatings around medium-sized detrital grains. High IGV is preserved with increasing burial due to the ductility of lithic rock fragments. Thick, continuous authigenic chlorite coating greatly reduces quartz precipitation and is thus crucial for preserving porosity at deep burial depths. Based on results from sedimentological, petrographic and petrophysical analyses, a sedimentological and diagenetic evolution of the Kobbe and Snadd Formation sandstones is proposed. This study concludes that initial mineralogy and texture have a crucial impact on the reservoir quality. As these factors reflect the provenance region, transport and processes occurring in the depositional environment, the importance of the sedimentological system is emphasized...|$|R
40|$|Corals {{provide the}} most widely used sea-level archive. Many coral species survive only in shallow water, {{therefore}} fossil corals emergent or submergent relative to present reefs, along stable coastlines, suggest variations in past sea level. Along the coastal margin of Western Australia (WA) an extensive series of marine isotope stage (MIS) 5 e reefs outcrop at 3 ± 1 m above sea level. The consistency of reef elevation along thousands of km of WA coastline demonstrates the tectonic stability of this trailing intraplate continental margin. There is also evidence of erosional terraces or incipient reef development at elevations above this + 3 m sea-level benchmark. Some workers reasoned that the higher elevation of these marine units is an artefact of localized tectonism or warping. This rationale fails to address: 1) <b>intertidal</b> <b>deposits</b> at multiple elevations in close proximity; 2) the distinct geomorphological difference between the lower and upper marine units; and 3) the similarity in elevation between WA emergent marine deposits and those found on stable carbonate platforms of The Bahamas and Bermuda. With accurate and precise dating of these emergent reef deposits {{it may be possible to}} characterise the nature of sea level during MIS 5 e. Coral skeletons are constructed of chemically unstable aragonite. Older coral material is generally more diagenetically altered, often suffering the addition or loss of uranium or thorium, which leads to inaccurate U-series age calculations. Coral diagenesis is generally determined by changes in carbonate mineralogy, but a more subtle form of geochemical alteration may affect the uranium-thorium age of corals that appear mineralogically pristine. In an attempt to extract meaningful ages from corals that have undergone isotopic exchange, modeled alpha-recoil processes were used to calculate open-system ages. These open-system ages are based on the assumption that alpha-recoil mobilisation is the only diagenetic process operating within the coral/reef unit. Independent age controls including: 1) the known duration of MIS 5 e; 2) stratigraphic superposition; and 3) age equivalence within individual corals, were used to test the reliability and accuracy of uncorrected and open-system corrected coral ages. Despite claims to the contrary, this study found open-system corrections to fail the above prescribed age tests, such that open-system corrections did not reflect the corals true age. Investigations into the nature of MIS 5 e sea levels were focused on two contrasting locations, Cape Cuvier, a high-energy coastal site, and Shark Bay, a low energy marine embayment. Both sites point to an extended period of widespread coral reef development at + 2 to + 4 m elevation with incipient reef and erosional terraces at between + 6 and + 10 m. The incipient nature of the upper coralgal rim and the fact that the lower terrace was not able to utilize the newly available accommodation space points to a brief but rapid sea level excursion to this new elevation. High-precision U-series dating returned coral ages that were inconsistent with the stratigraphic interpretation of the site and other known MIS 5 e sea level curves. In an attempt to fill in the temporal and spatial gaps left by coral dating, the Useries method was applied to crustose coralline algae (CCA). This study shows that living CCA capture a modern seawater equivalent  234 U value of 147. 02 ± 1. 5 ‰, and initial uranium concentrations of 0. 2 ± 0. 07 ppm. These initial chemistries allow for the examination of uranium and thorium isotopic evolution over geological timescales, however uranium uptake and detrital 232 Th contamination limit the usage of this material in U-series dating. Although we are confident of our interpretation of the sea-level history in WA during MIS 5 e, we offer the following considerations: 1) field observations and relationships remain the most reliable means of determining the succession of events in the case of MIS 5 e; 2) despite increased measuring precision of “high tech” dating methods, there is not necessarily a concomitant increase in the accuracy of the ages; and, 3) open-system corrections are not a reliable tool for determining a coral’s true age. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of heavy minerals in Middle to Upper Eocene deposits of western Belgium is discussed {{with reference to}} ternary diagrams based on density (4. 2) and mineralogical composition (ubiquist, parametamorphic and garnet-epidote-amphibole-pyroxene groups). A corresponding diamond diagram is used to interpret the transport mode and {{the energy of the}} sedimentary environment. The Aalter Formation (middle Eocene), which was deposited in a quiet to turbulent setting, contains high amounts of ubiquists, parametamorphic minerals and garnets, with a minor epidote and amphibole content. The Maldegem Formation (middle to late Eocene) of deltaic origin, is characterized by the dominance of ubiquists, particularly in the sands and silts. Garnets, parametamorphic minerals and small amounts of epidotes also occur. The heavy mineral {{distribution of}} the Zelzate Formation (late Eocene), an <b>intertidal</b> sand flat <b>deposit,</b> {{is similar to that of}} the Maldegem Formation, although it contains fewer parametamorphic minerals and more epidote and amphibole. Intrastratal dissolution of garnet due to subaerial weathering or continuous ground water flows occurred under shallow burial of the Maldegem and Zelzate formations in part of the study area. On the basis of paleogeographical considerations, it is concluded that the Middle and Upper Eocene sediments were supplied by a precursor of the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta sourced from western European massifs.

40|$|Mined since prehistoric times, oolitic ironstones (OIS) {{were a very}} {{important}} world source of iron from 1850 to 1945 : hereafter they have been progressively replaced by the Precambrian Banded Iron- Formations (BIF). OIS are iron-rich sedimentary rocks bearing ferruginous ooids. They consist of at least 15 % iron. In Western Europe, their overall depositional environment {{is that of a}} shallow shelf, most often located close to the transition from non-marine to marine environments. Their main age range is concentrated within the Ordovician through Devonian and the Jurassic through Paleogene. Proterozoic occurrences are known but these occur outside Europe. The host rocks of the ironstones are predominantly clastic, whereas the host sediment of the ferruginous ooids can be either clastic or carbonate or both. The OIS occur at the top of coarsening and shoaling upward cycles. They represent condensed deposits and transgressive system tracts. Numerous oolitic ironstone deposits are interpreted as tempestites or as <b>intertidal</b> <b>deposits.</b> It is generally agreed that ferruginous ooids formed in shallow marine water conditions, near the water-sediment interface, with repeated reworking of the sediment. Such an environment implies oxidizing conditions, the sedimentary iron being in the ferric state. The exact source of the iron is still a matter of discussion and speculation, just as the primary or secondary origin of the ferruginous ooids. Besides hematite (or goethite), also siderite, Fe-dolomite and berthierine/chamosite are present in the OIS as iron-bearing minerals. Due to weathering processes the carbonate matrix is often removed, the iron is released and oxidized, whereas the ferrous silicates are converted into ferric oxides or ferric hydroxides. Many old mining activities are based on occurrences of this weathered ore. The latter material has also strong staining properties. 1. Germany OIS are outcropping in the Eifel area. The latter is part of the Ardenno-Rhenish Massif and lies in the eastern extension of the Neufchateau Synclinorium, south of the Ardenne Anticlinorium (enclosing the Cambro-Ordovician Stavelot-Venn inlier). The general structure of the Eifel corresponds to an intensively folded and faulted synclinorium In the center of this synclinorium, outcrops of OIS occur on both flanks of successive synclines that are individually named (from the north to the south) : the Sötenicher Mulde, the Blankenheimer Mulde the Rohrer Mulde, the Dollendorfer Mulde, the Ahrdorfer Mulde and the Hillesheimer Mulde. Two important stratigraphic levels with IOS are known and they coincide more or less with the Lower-Middle Devonian boundary (Uppermost Emsian- Lowermost Eifelian). These OIS represent excellent marker beds for geological mapping. 2. The Netherlands There is no outcrop of OIS in this country. 3. Belgium Oolitic iron ores were formed during different periods in Belgium: the Lochkovian (Lower Devonian, Dinant Synclinorium, restricted to the Belgian-French border), the Givetian (Middle Devonian, Dinant Synclinorium), the Frasnian (Upper Devonian, Dinant Synclinorium), the Famennian (Upper Devonian, Namur S., Dinant S. & Vesdre S.) and the Toarcian-Aalenian (Jurassic, Lorraine area, Paris Basin – called “minette ore”). The most important OIS level is the Lower Famennian one. It has been intensively mined until the middle of the 20 th century, essentially in the Namur Synclinorium, between the cities of Namur and Huy. In this area, its important thickness (until 1. 85 m) and the number of layers triggered the development of an important economic activity. Outcrops were restricted to the tributaries of the Meuse River. The Famennian oolitic ironstone facies change from north to south by a gradual {{decrease in the number of}} layers, in their thickness, grain size, ooid concentration, clast size and iron content. They represent also excellent lithostratigraphical marker beds. The clay-dolomitic matrix is being progressively replaced by a calcitic cement. The other Devonian OIS levels are not of great economic importance, they were only mined locally, to supply smith’s working places. Due to surface mining, outcrops are now very rare, and often indicated by a light depression in the topography only. 4. Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg OIS are restricted to the Jurassic (Aalenian-Lower Bajocian) in the NW part of the Paris Basin. This essentially goethitic ore (“minette”) was intensively mined in the three adjacent country borders area (FR-BE-LU). No OIS levels in the Lower Devonian are outcropping in the northern part of the Grand Duchy. 5. France Numerous OIS layers are known in France at several stratigraphical levels, but a lot of them cannot be considered as a real ore. Paleozoic OIS belonging to the Armorican Massif were mined in the Normandy area (Urville Fm, Llanvirn, Middle Ordovician) and in the Bretagne area (Arenig, Lower Ordovician). In Normandy, OIS do outcrop inside several synclines (e. g. May and Urville Sy.), as one thick composite layer.   The spatial relationships of the different oolitic ironstone levels with the Linienbandkeramik settlements (LBK) in the studied area, will be presented...|$|R
