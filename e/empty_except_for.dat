5|$|While {{her mother}} attends the reunion, Emma visits Jordan at his hotel where she meets his teacher, Mr. Nystrom (Jeff Gruich). He takes {{her up to}} Jordan's hotel room but as they enter, Emma sees that it is {{completely}} <b>empty</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> a video camera which has been set up. She immediately becomes suspicious and tries to escape but Nystrom blocks her access to the bedroom door. She locks herself in the bathroom, and comes to the startling realization that Nystrom is Jordan. Nystrom apologizes and tells Emma he will let her go, but when she {{comes out of the}} bathroom he grabs and restrains her.|$|E
5|$|Back at the TARDIS, Jack begins {{integrating}} the extrapolator into the TARDIS {{to speed up}} the engine recharge. Rose and Mickey hang out together, and he admits to her that he is dating someone else because she is not there for him, and he begs her to promise him that she eventually will come back to him in the end, but before she can answer him, loud sounds like thunder start to reverberate through the area. Cardiff is soon struck by a large earthquake that seems to be coming from the Rift. The Doctor, Margaret, Rose and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift, rupturing it. Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer, and Margaret takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator. The heart of the TARDIS opens on the console, bathing Margaret in light. While she is captivated by the light, Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator. As the console closes, they find that Margaret's human suit is <b>empty</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> a Slitheen egg. The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Margaret wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her. The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Margaret can be raised in a different family. Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye, and runs out to look for him in the nearby area, but he is gone. Rose returns to the TARDIS, clearly distraught, and the Doctor offers to wait a little longer so she can search for Mickey, but she declines, saying that he deserves better.|$|E
25|$|Near a river, {{the group}} hears singing. They see three women washing clothes and singing. The women drug them with corn whiskey and they lose consciousness. Upon waking, Delmar finds Pete's clothes {{lying next to}} him, <b>empty</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> a toad. Delmar is {{convinced}} the women were Sirens and transformed Pete into the toad. Later, one-eyed Bible salesman Big Dan Teague invites them for a picnic lunch, then mugs them and kills the toad.|$|E

60|$|Presently {{the room}} was <b>emptied</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> the dead and dying on the floor, the victim upon the altar, the high priestess, and the madman. As the cunning eyes of the latter fell upon the woman they lighted with a new and sudden lust. Slowly he crept toward her, and now he spoke; but this time there fell upon Tarzan's {{surprised}} ears a language he could understand; the last one that he would ever have thought of employing in attempting to converse with human beings--the low guttural barking of the tribe of great anthropoids--his own mother tongue. And the woman answered {{the man in the}} same language.|$|R
50|$|A meteor lands {{near the}} site of the party, and {{electrical}} arcs cause a momentary blackout. The wild revelers do not notice brief, anomalous phenomena that occur during the blackout, such as a mirror image out of sync, but a drug dealer's girlfriend outside the party becomes spooked. As the raucous party proceeds, David searches the house for Jill, and Teddy attempts to charm Melanie. To Teddy's surprise, Melanie invites him to join her upstairs in ten minutes. Meanwhile, David spies on Jill as she flirts with a friend, and Allison, an outsider, unsuccessfully attempts to fit in. David attempts to apologize to Jill, but she becomes more angry with his fumbled apology and says that he makes her feel replaceable. The party moves outside, and the house <b>empties</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> David, Teddy, Allison, and Melanie.|$|R
25|$|Despite Nardole's caution, the Doctor allows Bill {{to select}} her first {{destination}} {{for a trip}} in the TARDIS. They land in the far future on an off-world Earth colony. The colony is <b>empty</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> millions of nanobots called the Vardy that maintain it, along with robotic avatars that interact with the pair via emoji. The robots give the Doctor and Bill badges which report their emotions also through emojiseemingly {{the only way to}} communicate with the Vardy.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{demolition}} in 1978 of the Black Rock open-air lido {{at the eastern}} end of Brighton's seafront, the area has been developed and now features one of Europe's largest marinas. However, the site of the pool itself remains <b>empty</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> a skate park and graffiti wall. Since 2003 a series of developments have been proposed but have come to nothing, including housing, a five-star hotel with a winter garden, and an 11,000-seat sports arena.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of Dreamscape players are given a diary, in {{which most of the}} pages are <b>empty</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> titles at the top of each page. The titles {{themselves}} are named after all the locations that can be visited throughout the game world, and as such players can use this to work out where they have to go to next. As the story processes the pages of the diary slowly fill up, giving extra information about the locations found in the game. It also provides back story to not only the main character, Wilson, but to the other characters as well. The diary also contains a map, which is designed to help players navigate the thirty acre world.|$|E
5000|$|Tim Reid, {{writing in}} The Times {{recorded}} how he met al-Janko in January 2002, {{when he was}} stranded in Kandahar, after his release from two years in brutal Taliban custody.Reid described finding al-Janko, and four other foreign prisoners, as the only remaining occupants of a Taliban prison, which had been abandoned and emptied after the Talibans collapse. In January 2002, shortly after the Taleban had fled Kandahar after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, I arrived in the city. Amid the chaos and confusion there was a bizarre scene playing out in the jail. The entire prison had been <b>emptied,</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> five men who had chosen to stay there because they had nowhere else to go. There was a man from Manchester called Jamal Udeen, two Saudis, a student from Tartarstan - and Mr al-Ginco. They {{became known as the}} “Kandahar Five”.|$|R
50|$|The {{district}} has subtropical climate. All the year rainy and cloudy weather prevails. The winters are not {{cold and the}} summers are warm. The hottest temperature 22 °C and the coldest is 6 °C. Humidity is around %65-70. Because of this rainy and humid weather all the area is covered by forests and hazelnut trees. One can never see an <b>empty</b> area <b>except</b> <b>for</b> the houses and the roads.|$|R
50|$|During Mobey and Dusan's fight, Pam and Keith are at Ged's house. Keith tells Deb that it's {{the last}} day for the land investment, and {{that all of the}} investors have to have the money in by noon. Deb tries to call Ged, who does not answer his phone because of the fight going on, so instead Deb gives Keith all of their money that they have in the house, which was 108,000 pounds. Deb and Pam goes upstairs to {{celebrate}} the deal by having sex and doing lines of coke again. Ged comes home and sees that the safe is empty and wakes up an intoxicated Deb. He is suspicious, and drives over to the Thompson's house, where the whole house is <b>emptied</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> a bottle of champagne. Deb and Ged realizes that they were scammed, and that the Thompson's were planning it for months, a wife and husband team that shafted them; clearly something that they are professionals in.|$|R
500|$|The world map is {{initially}} <b>empty</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> the starting location; it is customized as the player wins location [...] "tokens" [...] after certain missions. These tokens represent different terrains and settlements, such as plains, mountains, deserts, forests, and towns, {{that can be}} placed in slots on the world map. Items are rewarded to the player depending on {{the placement of the}} tokens. Ivalice also introduces areas called jagds, lawless slums that Judges avoid. Jagd is a German word which means the hunt. Jagds are the only places in the game in which a character can die; everywhere else, they are protected from death by the Judges and are simply knocked out.|$|E
500|$|Two more relief {{parties were}} mustered to {{evacuate}} any adults who {{might still be}} alive. [...] Both turned back before getting to Bear Valley, and no further attempts were made. On April 10, almost a month since the third relief had left Truckee Lake, the alcalde near Sutter's Fort organized a salvage party to recover what they could of the Donners' belongings. [...] The belongings would be sold, with part of the proceeds used to support the orphaned Donner children. The salvage party found the Alder Creek tents <b>empty</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> the body of George Donner, who had died only days earlier. On {{their way back to}} Truckee Lake, they found Lewis Keseberg alive. According to him, Mrs. Murphy had died a week after the departure of the third relief. Some weeks later, Tamsen Donner had arrived at his cabin on her way over the pass, soaked and visibly upset. Keseberg said that he put a blanket around her and told her to start out in the morning, but she died during the night.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing {{the camera}} footage, Satoru concludes {{that a third}} {{personality}} and location {{are part of the}} transfers. He leaves SPHIA and waits; the transfer occurs, and the third transfer point appears, {{in which there is a}} large cubical structure. The player can enter using the key from Satoru's room, or wait outside. If Satoru enters, he finds it <b>empty</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> a bed and a black sphere. The Enomoto of 2011 enters the structure, asking Satoru for his name; Satoru answers, after which Enomoto panics, saying that [...] "the project" [...] is ruined. He says that Satoru's memory has been transplanted from someone called [...] "That Guy", that the sphere is the transfer device, and that the third transfer point is a relay between the mountain and the island, to level air pressure during transfers; he also reveals that this was where Utsumi was when she was hospitalized in 2011. Another person, who is identical to Satoru, enters and stabs Satoru. While Satoru dies, the killer calls the person thought to be Enomoto [...] "Satoru", who in turn calls the killer [...] "Enomoto".|$|E

500|$|Witnesses {{maintained}} that {{immediately after the}} bomb blast there was an exchange of gunshots between police and demonstrators. Accounts vary widely as to who fired first and whether any of the crowd fired at the police. Historian Paul Avrich maintains that the police fired on the fleeing demonstrators, reloaded and then fired again, killing four and wounding as many as 70 people. What is not disputed is that {{in less than five}} minutes the square was <b>empty</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> the casualties. According to the May 4 New York Times demonstrators began firing at the police, who then returned fire. In his report on the incident, Inspector Bonfield wrote that he [...] "gave the order to cease firing, fearing that some of our men, in the darkness might fire into each other". An anonymous police official told the Chicago Tribune, [...] "A very large number of the police were wounded by each other's revolvers. ... It was every man for himself, and while some got two or three squares away, the rest emptied their revolvers, mainly into each other." ...|$|E

2500|$|In some {{versions}} of the story, the event {{is said to have}} taken place in Ephesus, in the House of the Virgin Mary. This is a much more recent and localized tradition. The earliest traditions say that Mary's life ended in Jerusalem (see [...] "Mary's Tomb"). By the 7th century, a variation emerged, according to which one of the apostles, often identified as St Thomas, was not present at the death of Mary but his late arrival precipitates a reopening of Mary's tomb, which is found to be <b>empty</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> her grave clothes. In a later tradition, Mary drops her girdle down to the apostle from heaven as testament to the event. This incident is depicted in many later paintings of the Assumption.|$|E
60|$|The torch was {{withdrawn}} and the casement shut with a snap. In those days quiet burghers {{could not afford}} to be mixed up in street troubles, especially if soldiers had to do with them.

50|$|Rhodes {{arrives at}} his penthouse, {{where he was}} {{to meet with the}} nation's {{business}} and political elite. Instead, he finds an <b>empty</b> space <b>except</b> <b>for</b> a group of black butlers and servants, by whom, in desperation, he demands to be loved. When they fail to respond, Rhodes viciously dismisses all of them. Rhodes calls the studio and Jeffries, with Miller holding the phone, listens to him rant as he threatens to jump to his death from the penthouse. Jeffries, who has been silent, grabs the phone and screams at Rhodes to jump, and to get out of her, and everybody's, life.|$|R
50|$|Unable {{to reach}} Dr. Kovač by pager, they send a student over to fetch him. The party {{immediately}} evaporates, as everyone runs {{back to the}} ER to help {{the victims of the}} porch collapse. A surprised Carter returns from the restroom to <b>empty</b> tables, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> an orderly he doesn't know. They spend some time watching a slideshow of his time at County. The presentation features past ER doctors, including Dr. Doug Ross (George Clooney), Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), and Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq La Salle). Eventually Dr. Lewis brings Carter back to the ER.|$|R
2500|$|Reggae drumbeats {{fall into}} three main categories: One drop, Rockers, and Steppers. With the One drop, the {{emphasis}} is entirely on the backbeat (usually on the snare, or as a rim shot combined with bass drum). Beat one is <b>empty</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> a closed high hat commonly used, which is unusual in popular music. There is some controversy about whether reggae should be counted so that this beat falls on two and four, or {{whether it should be}} counted twice as fast, so it falls on three. An example played by Barrett can be heard in the Bob Marley and the Wailers song [...] "One Drop". Barrett often used an unusual triplet cross-rhythm on the hi-hat, which can be heard on many recordings by Bob Marley and the Wailers, such as [...] "Running Away" [...] on the Kaya album.|$|E
2500|$|Ezio and Sofia {{return to}} Masyaf, where Ezio uses {{the keys to}} unlock Altaïr's library. He finds it <b>empty</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> Altaïr's {{skeleton}} and a sixth key. He discovers that the library {{was not meant to}} hold books—rather, it was a vault meant to house Altaïr's Apple of Eden. Through the key, Ezio learns that Altaïr had sealed himself inside to preserve its secret from the Templars. Ezio leaves this Apple in the library, saying [...] "I have seen enough for one life." [...] He then begins talking directly to Desmond, not knowing exactly who (or where) he is, but knowing that he is watching. While talking he discards his weapons. He tells Desmond that he realises that he is a [...] "conduit for a message". He expresses hope that Desmond will be able to find answers to the questions he and Altaïr had worked so hard to uncover.|$|E
2500|$|Aggressive {{marketing}} efforts served {{to reinforce the}} Empire State Building's status as the world's tallest. The observatory was advertised in local newspapers {{as well as on}} railroad tickets. The building became a popular tourist attraction, with one million people each paying one dollar to ride elevators to the observation decks in 1931. In its first year of operation, the observation deck took in approximately 2million dollars, as much money as its owners made in rent that year. By 1936, the top of the building was consistently crowded from sunset to midnight, with people heading to the top to eat leisurely $1.25 dinners with a [...] "wide selection of long, chill drinks". NBC also took advantage of the building, leasing space on the 85th floor for radio broadcasts from 1931 on. On the whole, however, the building was in debt from the outset, losing $1 million per year by 1935. Real estate developer Seymour Durst recalled that the building was so underused in 1936 that there was no elevator service above the 45th floor, as the building above the 41st floor was <b>empty</b> <b>except</b> <b>for</b> the NBC offices and the Raskob/Du Pont offices on the 81st floor.|$|E

2500|$|As his {{political}} career progressed, Kahane became increasingly isolated in the Knesset. His speeches, boycotted by Knesset members, were made to an <b>empty</b> parliament, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> the duty chairman and the transcriptionist. Kahane's legislative proposals and motions of no-confidence against the government were ignored or rejected by fellow Knesset members. Kahane often pejoratively called other Knesset members [...] "Hellenists" [...] in Hebrew (a reference from Jewish religious texts describing ancient Jews who assimilated into Greek culture after Judea's occupation by Alexander the Great). In 1987, Rabbi Kahane opened a yeshiva (HaRaayon HaYehudi) with funding from U.S. supporters, for the teaching of [...] "the Authentic Jewish Idea".|$|R

2500|$|A [...] "real" [...] {{staircase}} can {{be thought}} of as a [...] "compressed" [...] flight, where the intermediate pounds have disappeared, and the upper gate of one lock is also the lower gate of the one above it. However, it is incorrect to use the terms staircase and flight interchangeably: because of the absence of intermediate pounds, operating a staircase is very different from operating a flight. It can be more useful to think of a staircase as a single lock with intermediate levels (the top gate is a normal top gate, and the intermediate gates are all as tall as the bottom gate). As there is no intermediate pound, a chamber can only be filled by emptying the one above, or emptied by filling the one below: thus the whole staircase has to be full of water (except for the bottom chamber) before a boat starts to ascend, or <b>empty</b> (<b>except</b> <b>for</b> the top chamber) before a boat starts to descend. By building a pair of such lock sets (one used to climb and the other to descend) these difficulties are avoided, as well as enabling a greater traffic volume and reduced wait times.|$|E

Companies of the 51st and 2nd divisions attacked at [...] and were caught in their barrage, some troops reaching Frankfort Trench then returning to New Munich Trench. A 2nd Division attack with two battalions of the 37th Division lost direction in the mist and fell back to Wagon Road with many casualties, while a third battalion strengthened the left flank by bombing forward and building a strong point in the Quadrilateral, {{near the top of}} Redan Ridge, as two tanks in support bogged down early. After dark, the 37th Division in the V Corps area, pushed up Ancre Trench and set up posts in Bois d'Hollande and at Railway and Muck trenches. The 32nd Division, from II Corps reserve, took over from the 2nd Division on the northern defensive flank, where there was considerable confusion over the location of the front line. During the night the right linked up with the 51st Division at New Munich Trench and Leave Avenue. During 17 November, the 32nd Division extended to the right to relieve the 51st Division.|$|E

When the two next appear before the council together, the elder Gustav the Short and Curly and Kröd gets into an argument over whether one should have pubic hair atop their heads. In the final, one-minute clip, Kröd expresses anger upon learning of the Pagan village attack: [...] "They can raid our villages, they can burn our crops, they can steal our cattle, but I refuse {{to live in a world}} where good men are shot in the anuses!"
