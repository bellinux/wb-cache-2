5|$|The Severn Estuary {{has one of}} {{the highest}} tidal ranges in the world, up to , second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. The estuary's funnel shape, its tidal range, and the {{underlying}} geology of rock, <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand,</b> produce strong tidal streams and high turbidity, giving the water a notably brown colouration. The tidal range means that the legs of the pier are largely exposed at low tide and hidden at high tide and the landing stage at the end of the pier has several levels to allow boats to dock at all stages of the tide.|$|E

50|$|Deposition in a wadi is rapid {{because of}} the sudden loss of stream {{velocity}} and seepage of water into the porous sediment. Wadi deposits are thus usually poorly sorted <b>gravels</b> <b>and</b> <b>sands.</b> These sediments are often reworked by eolian processes.|$|R
5|$|There is no {{standing}} {{fresh water}} on Caroline Island, although the Nake and South Islets harbor underground freshwater aquifers (or Ghyben-Herzberg lenses), and wells {{have been built}} to tap drinking water for temporary settlements. Soils on Caroline are similarly poor, dominated by coral <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand,</b> with significant organic content present only within stable, forested island centers. Guano deposits make island soil, where it does exist, nitrogen-rich; {{but even in the}} oldest and most vegetated regions of the atoll, soils are only a few centimeters (one or two inches) thick.|$|E
5|$|To allow steamers {{to bring}} day {{trippers}} to Weston-super-Mare from ports {{on both the}} English and Welsh side of the Bristol Channel, a landing jetty was extended {{on the west side}} of the island. The Severn Estuary has the second highest tidal range in the world second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. The estuary's funnel shape, its tidal range, and the underlying geology of rock, <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand,</b> produce strong tidal streams and high turbidity, giving the water a notably brown colouration. The tidal range means that the legs of the pier are largely exposed at low tide and hidden at high tide.|$|E
5|$|Females vacate {{the nest}} after spawning, leaving the male behind {{to protect the}} eggs during the eight to ten days of incubation. A nest may contain 2,000 to 5,000 eggs, {{possibly}} more. Fecundity is usually related to size of the fish, so it isn't unusual for the roe of a large gravid female to contain over 55,000 eggs. Bowfin eggs are adhesive, and will attach to aquatic vegetation, roots, <b>gravel,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand.</b> After hatching, larval bowfin do not swim actively in search of food. During the seven to nine days required for yolk-sac absorption, they attach to vegetation {{by means of an}} adhesive organ on their snout, and remain protected by the parent male bowfin. Bowfin aggressively protect their spawn from the first day of incubation to a month or so after the eggs have hatched. When the fry are able to swim and forage on their own, they will form a school and leave the nest accompanied by the parent male bowfin who slowly circles them to prevent separation.|$|E
50|$|It {{is common}} to find areas where a layer of pebbles is left after wind and water removes the lighter <b>gravels</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand,</b> <b>and</b> the pebbles are {{cemented}} together with desert varnish, causing landforms called desert pavement that are impenetrable to many species. Unlike in the Arizona Upland where trees are common, they are mostly absent, except along watercourses and areas where water collects after rain.|$|R
50|$|The {{landscape}} of the nature park was shaped by the ice age, <b>and</b> the <b>gravels</b> <b>and</b> <b>sands</b> laid down during that time form an undulating to gently rolling terrain, made from areas of sandur, sheets of ground moraine {{and the remains of}} end moraines.|$|R

25|$|Mining is {{the third}} {{component}} of production land-use in the province. As of 2009, there are 15 mining and quarrying areas operating in Cavite. Extraction includes filling materials, <b>gravel,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand.</b>|$|E
25|$|Quarrying {{has taken}} place for chalk, clay for brickmaking and <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand</b> in the river valleys. Flint, also {{extracted}} from quarries, was often used to build older local buildings. Several former quarries, now flooded, have become nature reserves.|$|E
50|$|Geologically, {{the area}} {{belongs to the}} Lower Rhine Bay on whose western edge it lies. Its topmost soil layer {{consists}} mainly of loess which is highly suitable for agriculture and which was deposited during {{the last ice age}} in a layer up to 10 metres thick on the <b>gravels</b> <b>and</b> <b>sands</b> of the Rhine. Beneath this upper layer are <b>gravels,</b> <b>sands,</b> clays, <b>and</b> brown coal strata of the Tertiary. The brown coal seams of the Lower Rhine Bay are very thick in places and are mined in large open-cast pits (in the area of Rheindalen in the Garzweiler Mine); The brown coal seam of Morken has, for example, a thickness of around 150 metres. In permeable, beds such as <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>sands,</b> groundwater is present on several superimposed levels. These levels are separated by relatively impermeable layers of silt and clay.|$|R
40|$|Weathered <b>gravels</b> <b>and</b> <b>sands</b> {{that can}} be cut easily with a knife form {{impressive}} deposits of Eocene, Miocene. and early Pleistocene age in Oregon and Washington. The deposits {{are believed to be}} profiles of weathering developed at or near the surface and are derived mainly from quartz-free fragments, chiefly from basalts and andesites, which had been deposited by streams. The minerals of the weathered <b>gravels</b> <b>and</b> <b>sands</b> include: kaolinite-halloysite, b ldel-lite-nontronite, montmorillonite, gibbsite, iddingsite, siderite, ilmenite, limonite, vlvianite, celadonite, feldspars, quartz, muscovite and minor amounts of others. No apparent change in volume accompanied the change of the original silicate minerals in the pebbles, cobbles and boulders to clay minerals. Chemical and petrographic observations indicate that readjustments by the clay minerals formed in the rounded fragments and matrix were accomplished with the preservation of outward shapes and textures of the original rock fragments...|$|R

25|$|Portland cement {{is a basic}} {{ingredient}} of concrete, mortar and most non-specialty grout. The most common use for Portland cement is {{in the production of}} concrete. Concrete is a composite material consisting of aggregate (<b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand),</b> cement, and water.

25|$|In the 20th century, the {{outskirts}} of the city become filled with open pit mines for <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand.</b> There was even one opened on a hill in the San Diego and La Florecilla neighborhoods, near the historic center called Salsipuedes. These prompted environmental and local community organizations to protest, stating that the valley is a closed water basin and the mining negatively affects potable water supplies. Salsipuedes was closed in the 2000s.|$|E

5000|$|Placer gold strikes were [...] "poor man's diggings". Placer gold {{is formed}} by erosion forces which slowly break down gold veins {{embedded}} in bed rock and over geologic time leave {{the gold in}} the <b>gravels</b> <b>and</b> <b>sands</b> of ancient or presently flowing river beds. The gold is in a natural state {{in the form of}} gold dust, flakes or nuggets. [...] Such deposits required no special processing, except the hard grueling work to dig out and sort through tons of <b>gravel,</b> dirt, <b>sand</b> <b>and</b> boulders. Newly discovered deposits like Confederate Gulch attracted young footloose men, motivated by a desire to get rich quickly.|$|R
5|$|Besides {{farming and}} its {{associated}} industries, including making cider, cheese and yoghurt, and peat extraction, the county has little industry.

25|$|Just North of the town, is {{the ancient}} Lake Agassiz beach ridge. About 10,000 years ago, this huge inland lake, the {{remnants}} of glaciers, began to drain in present-day Manitoba. Left behind were the <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand</b> deposits that were once the beaches of the former lake. These ridges mark {{the northern edge of}} the Red River Valley, and offer a different geological atmosphere. Many local gravel pits are found in this region.|$|E
25|$|Past floods have {{resulted}} in both deepening and reduction in river depth, creation of new sand banks and shoals as well as increased transport of suspended sediment from upstream. Before the invention of modern dredging techniques the sediment deposited by flooding created hazards to ships navigating the river. Even medium-sized vessels no longer travel up the Brisbane River beyond the city reach, and dredging of the upper reaches has ceased, allowing the river to recover substantially from the fine silt dislodged by <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand</b> extraction.|$|E

25|$|Initial {{reports were}} that the team's colours were to be red and white, but the Leafs wore white sweaters with a green maple leaf for their first game on February 17, 1927. On September 27, 1927, it was {{announced}} that the Leafs had changed their colour scheme to blue and white. Although Smythe later stated he chose blue because it represents the Canadian skies and white to represent snow, these colours were also used on his <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand</b> business' trucks. The colour scheme also followed a longstanding tradition of top-level, Toronto-based teams using blue as their primary colour, starting with the Toronto Argonauts in 1873, the University of Toronto Varsity Blues in 1877, the Maple Leafs baseball team, as well as the NHA's Toronto Blueshirts.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} for medium active wastes in the nuclear {{industry}} {{to be treated with}} ion exchange or other means to concentrate the radioactivity into a small volume. The much less radioactive bulk (after treatment) is often then discharged. For instance, it is possible to use a ferric hydroxide floc to remove radioactive metals from aqueous mixtures. After the radioisotopes are absorbed onto the ferric hydroxide, the resulting sludge can be placed in a metal drum before being mixed with cement to form a solid waste form. In order to get better long-term performance (mechanical stability) from such forms, they may be made from a mixture of fly ash, or blast furnace slag, and Portland cement, instead of normal concrete (made with Portland cement, <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand).</b>|$|E
25|$|Like most of Burgundy, the {{vineyard}} soils of the Cote de Nuits is extremely varied. Even {{areas on the}} same hillside or only separated by a single dirt path can have dramatically different soil compositions. The Burgundian attribute this diversity of soils to the terroir {{of the region and}} as partial explanation for how a pinot noir wine made near the village of Gevrey-Chambertin can taste so different from a pinot noir made in the adjoining village of Morey-St-Denis. Despite these differences, there are some broad generalizations that can be made. Most vineyards contain a base soil of limestone with marl (a clay and limestone mixture) that often includes a mixture of <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand.</b> Historically Burgundian wine growers would uses the proportion of limestone to marl as a guide for what type of grape varieties would be most suited to the area. If the area had a high concentration of marl, pinot noir was planted while Chardonnay would grow in vineyards dominated by limestone.|$|E
40|$|The geology of Quaternary sediments and {{the results}} of petro-graphic {{exploration}} of <b>gravels</b> <b>and</b> <b>sands</b> in the Drava and Mura rivers basins are described.

50|$|The {{particle}} size distribution of a soil sample may indicate {{the conditions under which}} the strata or sediment were deposited. Particle sizes are generally separated by means of dry or wet sieving (coarse samples such as till, <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>sands,</b> sometimes coarser silts) or by measuring the changes of the density of a dispersed solution (in sodiumpyrophosphate, for example))of the sample (finer silts, clays). A rotating clock-glass with a very fine-grained dispersed sample under a heat lamp is useful in separating particles.|$|R
50|$|The site lies in {{the valley}} of the River Cober on the Carnmenellis granite outcrop.
