500|$|... {{ever before}} was {{anything}} like this season– we never went to bed before half-past one, every hour of every day was filled with engagements three weeks beforehand, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>through</b> more music in two months than in {{all the rest of}} the year.|$|E
500|$|Davey was {{initially}} uncomfortable with being {{described as a}} singer-songwriter but is now more accepting of the term. She describes her songwriting style: I write in short quick spurts of manic creativity, which are followed by spells of borderline writer's block where the writing comes really painfully and laboriously. I’m sure it's a universal experience for anyone who writes, but it's difficult to get out of, you can't just wish it away—it just disappears when it's had enough. It’s completely independent of whether I’m happy or blue, up or down. It tends to lift as soon as I stop fixating on it—I remember thinking my house was the problem, and I'd {{need to go to}} France in order to write, and I would have been scared without Rex [...] <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>through</b> it. You can't chase the muse, or you'll scare it away.|$|E
2500|$|Australian outside centre Gary Ella {{scored a}} try after Campese handled the ball {{twice in the}} movement. In On a Wing and a Prayer Campese writes that, [...] "We led at 19-3 half-time, having plundered a gale-force wind in our favour {{in the first half}} at Athletic Park, Wellington. After two early Roger Gould penalty goals, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>through</b> and found Mark Ella close by in support. Gould took it on, I backed him up and gave Gary Ella the scoring pass." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was brought}} up among the Mahrattas, sir. <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>through</b> easily, and only once came upon a body of Holkar's cavalry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{took your}} sister home," [...] he announced. [...] "We found {{a light in}} her sitting-room and the door locked. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> in <b>through</b> the window." ...|$|R
6000|$|I don't {{know that}} I need {{set out the}} details of the interview. He waited till <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>through</b> my halting speech of mingled {{gratitude}} and expostulation, then remarked: ...|$|R
2500|$|Rauschenberg {{picked up}} trash and found objects that {{interested}} {{him on the}} streets of New York City and brought these back to his studio where they could become integrated into his work. He claimed he [...] "wanted something other than what I could make myself and I wanted to use the surprise and the collectiveness and the generosity of finding surprises. And if it wasn't a surprise at first, by the time <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>through</b> with it, it was. [...] So the object itself was changed by its context and therefore it became a new thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Abdul was {{discovered}} by The Jacksons, after {{a few of the}} band members had watched her while attending a Los Angeles Lakers game. She was signed to do the choreography for the video to their single [...] "Torture". [...] "My only problem was how to tell the Jacksons how to dance," [...] Abdul later recalled. [...] "Imagine me telling them what routines to do. I was young, I was scared. I'm not quite sure how <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>through</b> that." [...] The success of the choreography in the video led to Abdul's career of choreographer in music videos. It was also due {{to the success of the}} video that Abdul was chosen to be the choreographer for the Jacksons' Victory tour.|$|E
2500|$|Abdul, a Laker Girl at the time, {{took over}} as the {{choreographer}} from that point. She {{said some of the}} members of the band approached her after attending a Laker game and asked if she wanted to choreograph their video. [...] "My only problem was how to tell the Jacksons how to dance," [...] Abdul later recalled. [...] "Imagine me telling them what routines to do. I was young, I was scared. I'm not quite sure how <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>through</b> that." [...] The success of the choreography in the video helped lead to Abdul's then new career of choreographer in music videos. It was also due to the success of the video that she was chosen to be the choreographer for the Jacksons' Victory tour.|$|E
60|$|By this time, {{tumbling}} {{things in}} as they came, {{we had the}} jolly-boat loaded {{as much as we}} dared. Joyce and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> out <b>through</b> the stern-port, and we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>through</b> that, thank Heaven! To {{tell the}} truth, father, I {{am not in}} the least afraid of Mr. Moss. Before he should touch me you may be sure that he would have the worst of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know exactly, Dave. But <b>I</b> <b>got</b> word <b>through</b> Ben Basswood's cousin that Nat {{had told}} Ben he wasn't {{going to let}} you ride over him this term. I think Nat is jealous because you were so {{successful}} in that trip to Cave Island." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY A. I've {{told the}} Dancys--she was in bed. And <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>through</b> to Newmarket, Charles, and Inspector Dede is coming {{like the wind}} on a motor cycle.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>through</b> some jargon to {{the effect}} that I took the liberty of doubting that. That I knew better. That there could be no such beauty without it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--er--I packed it in a hurry, you know. I {{wanted to}} go fishing, and so <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>through</b> as soon as I could. Oh, I guess it's all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> her <b>through</b> my old friend, Blandly, who [...] {{has proved}} himself {{throughout}} {{the most surprising}} [...] trump. The admirable fellow literally slaved in [...] my interest, and so, I may say, did everyone in [...] Bristol, {{as soon as they}} got wind of the port we [...] sailed for--treasure, I mean.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{say it to}} make favour with you, because I don't {{want you}} to spare me, and I don't ask you; but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> into it <b>through</b> Milton K. Rogers." ...|$|R
60|$|I saw {{no sign of}} {{the girl}} in the plantation. When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> out, <b>through</b> the sand-hills, on to the beach, there she was, in her little straw bonnet, and her plain grey cloak that she always wore to hide her {{deformed}} shoulder as much as might be--there she was, all alone, looking out on the quicksand and the sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "Living by myself, I became (as I {{have already}} acknowledged) {{important}} to myself--and, {{as a necessary}} consequence, I enjoyed registering my own daily doings. Let passages copied from my journal reveal how <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>through</b> the day." ...|$|E
60|$|BLUNTSCHLI. When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>through</b> to Peerot I {{had to put}} it in safe keeping somehow. I {{thought of}} the railway cloak room; but that's the surest place to get looted in modern warfare. So I pawned it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'NOV. 30. - <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>through</b> my Chatham lecture very fairly though {{almost all}} my {{apparatus}} went astray. I dined at the mess, and got home to Isleworth the same evening; your father very kindly sitting up for me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hard {{work in the}} museum," [...] said Mr. George; [...] "but <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>through.</b> To-morrow <b>I</b> mean to rest, and I {{wish you}} would take me off to-morrow, somewhere on an excursion. I don't care where it is, {{provided}} I have nothing to think or to say about it. I don't want even to know where I am going." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are helping}} me, Netta!" [...] Hilda exclaimed {{with tears in}} her eyes. [...] "How should <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> on <b>through</b> all this sad time if you had not been here to comfort and cheer me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Gee! That's going some, isn't it? Wants amputation, a {{name like}} that. I call it mean to give a poor, defenceless kid a cuss-word like--what's it? Rutherford? <b>I</b> <b>got</b> it--to go <b>through</b> the world with. Haven't you got {{something}} shorter--Tom, or Charles or something?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I had to {{tell her}} the whole story, too; and every time I tell it it seems sillier and sillier to imagine that Ken meant {{anything}} serious. I felt idiotic and ashamed by the time <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>through.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what Marvin {{warned me}} yesterday, when I ordered the equipment," [...] said he. [...] "He {{told me that}} before <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>through</b> with this deal it would run up into the thousands. And he added that Millville wasn't worth it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{am going}} on here at the same great rate, but am always {{counting}} the days that lie between me and home. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>through</b> the first fourth of my readings on Friday, January 3rd. I leave for two readings at Philadelphia this evening.|$|E
60|$|INSPECTOR THEAKSTONE--Your {{letter and}} {{inclosure}} came safe to hand. Wise men, they say, may always learn something {{even from a}} fool. By the time <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>through</b> Sharpin's maundering report of his own folly, I saw my way clear enough {{to the end of}} the Rutherford Street case, just as you thought I should. In half an hour's time I was at the house. The first person I saw there was Mr. Sharpin himself.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was voted}} Manchester United's Player of the Month for August 2016. Talking to MUTV, he said [...] "The Man-of-the-Match awards are {{something}} I hadn’t thought about but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> them <b>through</b> {{the hard work}} I have put in. I hope {{to see more of}} that in the weeks ahead of us." [...] On 23 October 2016, Bailly was substituted off in the 52nd minute after suffering a serious knee injury during the 4-0 loss at Chelsea.|$|R
6000|$|... '"That {{night my}} lord nearly died of asphyxia. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> him <b>through</b> {{it for the}} time; and his eyes showed that he {{understood}} me when I told him, the next morning, that I had posted the letter. This was his last effort of consciousness. When I saw him again he was sunk in apathy. He lingered {{in a state of}} insensibility, supported by stimulants, until the 25th, and died (unconscious to the last) on the evening of that day.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see why not," [...] he answered. [...] "These {{clothes are}} French, and I'm sure this floppy bow {{would make a}} Frenchman of me anyhow. Perhaps I ought to have let you order the dinner, but I think <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>through</b> it pretty well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Music has charms {{to soothe}} a savage breast,'" [...] quoted Peter, who {{was getting into}} the habit of adorning his {{conversation}} with similar gems. [...] "That's in one of Shakespeare's plays. I'm reading them now, since <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>through</b> with the Bible. They're great." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ow <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>through</b> {{the rest}} of the night I don’t know. It seemed to be twenty nights instead of one, but the day came at last, and when the hands came on at six o’clock they found the gate open and me on dooty same as usual.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Chrysostom was {{accompanied}} by a lady in her second youth, very graceful, very charmingly dressed, and with an expression of winning intelligence, whom she named to me simply as Cecilia, in the Altrurian fashion. She apparently knew no English, and at first Mrs. Chrysostom translated each of her questions and my answers. When <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>through,</b> this lady began to question me herself in Altrurian, which I owned to understanding a little. She said: ...|$|R
6000|$|The first I {{knew of the}} {{peculiar}} Alderling situation was shortly after William James's [...] "Will to Believe" [...] came out. I had been telling the Alderlings about it, for they had not seen it, and I noticed that {{from time to time}} they looked significantly at each other. When <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>through</b> he gave a little laugh, and she said, [...] "Oh, you may laugh!" [...] and then I made bold to ask, [...] "What is it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Henry Walkinghame! I {{know the}} man. I {{found him in}} one of the caves at Thebes, among the mummies, laid up with a fever, nearly ready to be a mummy himself! I {{remember}} bleeding him--irregular, was not it? but one does not stand on ceremony in Pharaoh's tomb. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> him <b>through</b> with it; we came up the Nile together, and the last I saw of him was at Alexandria. He is your man! something might be done with him!" ...|$|R
