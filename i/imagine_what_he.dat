500|$|Costume {{designer}} Lindy Hemming {{described the}} Joker's look as reflecting his personality, in that [...] "he doesn't care about himself at all"; she avoided designing {{him as a}} vagrant, but still made him appear to be [...] "scruffier, grungier," [...] so that [...] "when you see him move, he's slightly twitchier or edgy." [...] Nolan noted, [...] "We gave a Francis Bacon spin to [...] This corruption, this decay in {{the texture of the}} look itself. It's grubby. You can almost <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> smells like." [...] In creating the [...] "anarchical" [...] look of the Joker, Hemming drew inspiration from such countercultural pop culture artists as Pete Doherty, Iggy Pop, and Johnny Rotten. Ledger described his [...] "clown" [...] mask, made up of three pieces of stamped silicone, as a [...] "new technology," [...] taking less than an hour for the make-up artists to apply, much faster than more-conventional prosthetics usually requires. Ledger also said that he felt he was barely wearing any make-up.|$|E

60|$|Poor Molinda merely stared; for {{she could}} not <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant. In a moment he was gone; and having taken, by the king's permission, the flying carpet, he {{was back at the}} ambassador's house in Gluckstein.|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} no true sound, Joe only <b>imagined</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{expected}} and hated and dreaded to hear.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you'll excuse me, I {{should like}} to go now." [...] Her manner was restive, for she remembered her promise, and <b>imagined</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was about to say. [...] "But as it is not late," [...] she added, [...] "I can walk home, and leave my man and Liddy to come when they choose." ...|$|R
60|$|Bill was a {{sensible}} fellow. He knew that {{escape from the}} service, except in a dishonourable manner, was impossible, so he {{made up his mind}} to do his duty like a man, and return {{home at the end of}} the war (which he hoped would be a short one), and marry Nelly Blyth. Poor fellow, <b>he</b> little <b>imagined</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had to go through before--but hold, we must not anticipate the story.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{spoke to}} him in my life," [...] I said grumpily. [...] "Can't <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> means by competing. He has been trying for my job after I left--and didn't get it. But that isn't exactly competition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Here' was a jeweller's shop. I couldn't <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{could want}} there. It seemed {{a sort of}} mad freak. He thrusts under my nose three rings, which looked very tiny on his big, brown palm, {{growling}} out-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Ladislaw! What can {{he have to}} say to me?" [...] she exclaimed, in a tone of pleased surprise. [...] "But," [...] she added, {{looking at}} Mr. Casaubon, [...] "I can <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has written to you about." ...|$|E
60|$|The savage is {{but little}} of an imaginative being. We are tempted, at times, to imagine him {{more so than}} he is, for his fanciful folk-lore. The proof of which {{overestimation}} is that we find no difficulty in <b>imagining</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> does, and even of <b>imagining</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> probably <b>imagined,</b> and finding our suppositions verified by discovery. Yet his powers of observation may be marvellously developed. The North American Indian tracks his foe through the forest by signs unrecognizable to a white man, and he reasons most astutely upon them, and still that very man {{turns out to be}} a mere child when put before problems a trifle out of his beaten path. And all because his forefathers had not the power to <b>imagine</b> something beyond <b>what</b> they actually saw. The very essence of the force of imagination lies in its ability to change a man's habitat for him. Without it, man would forever have remained, not a mollusk, to be sure, but an animal simply. A plant cannot change its place, an animal cannot alter its conditions of existence except within very narrow bounds; man is free in the sense nothing else in the world is.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Professor didn't say anything; but flew up on Mr. Crow's perch, looking sour as vinegar, and I said {{to myself}} then {{that he was the}} one we had the most reason to fear. You could tell by the look in his eye that he was already {{thinking}} up some wicked plan, and I really had palpitation of the heart because of <b>imagining</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{might be able to do}} if he set himself right down to getting revenge.|$|R
5000|$|... "Grigoryants was {{a colossal}} talent!" [...] remembered {{one of the}} people who lived in Namangan at that time. [...] " [...] <b>What</b> an Individual <b>he</b> was! I can only <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> armor <b>he</b> needed in order to {{perforate}} the routine of those years! And he perforated it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Here Mr Powell fairly {{burst into}} tears. [...] "No one could help loving Captain Anthony. I leave you to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was to her. Yet before the week was {{out it was}} she who was helping me to pull myself together." ...|$|E
60|$|Jonas laughed very heartily at this question, {{but gave}} no answer. Rollo could not <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could he {{laughing}} at. Jonas, however, would not tell him, {{but said that}} he would know all about it, when he should come to see Franco Ney.|$|E
6000|$|But before night {{came the}} squire had been talked over, and {{had agreed to}} see his son. [...] "The {{interview}} will be easy enough for me," [...] he had said, [...] "but I cannot <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> will get from me. But let him come as he will." ...|$|E
60|$|James {{looked at}} Mrs. Jackson very coolly, {{and she never}} <b>imagined</b> with <b>what</b> {{difficulty}} <b>he</b> was repressing himself.|$|R
60|$|His {{voice had}} sunk {{almost to a}} whisper, but, though it trembled, the fact of his {{pleading}} gave it intensity. He had the same attitude, his thumbs in his trousers, his neat attentive young head, his smile, which {{was a matter of}} course; no one would have <b>imagined</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was saying. She had listened without moving and at the end she raised her eyes. They rested on his own a moment, and he remembered for a long time the look, the clear effluence of splendid maidenhood, as deep as a surrender, that passed her lids.|$|R
60|$|He never, by any chance, quite {{kept his}} word, {{though there was}} a moment in every case when he seemed to <b>imagine</b> doing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said, and he took with mute {{patience}} the rakings which the ladies gave him when he disappointed them.|$|R
6000|$|... "To find {{fault with}} him, my dear; {{to try to}} think he was not just the handsomest and most {{engaging}} young man I had ever seen; to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> ought to be, in place of what he was; and among other things, to inquire who he was?" ...|$|E
60|$|But he didn't approach. He stopped, gazed absently {{toward our}} dusky mass a minute, evidently {{thinking}} about something else; then set down his light, moved musingly toward the door, and before a body could <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was going to do, {{he was out of}} the door and had closed it behind him.|$|E
6000|$|One {{night it}} blew what Pomona called a [...] "whirlicane," [...] {{and we went}} to bed very early to keep warm. We heard our boarder on deck in the garden after we were in bed, and Euphemia said she could not <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was about, unless he was {{anchoring}} his turnips to keep them from blowing away.|$|E
500|$|Littell said {{he wanted}} to focus on the {{thinking}} of an executioner and of origins of state murder, showing how we can take decisions that lead, or not, to a genocide. Littell claims he set out creating the character Max Aue by <b>imagining</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would have done and how he would have behaved if he had been born into Nazi Germany. One childhood event that kept Littell interested in the question of being a killer was the Vietnam War. According to him, his childhood terror was that he would be drafted, sent to Vietnam [...] "and made to kill women and children who hadn't done anything to me." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said to Driscoll {{would prevent}} the quarrel {{beginning}} again, and presently {{went back to the}} mine, feeling satisfied. There was now not much risk of Drummond and Driscoll making friends and finding that both knew something about the lode. Thirlwell was persuaded that Driscoll did know something, more in fact than anybody else; he knew where Strange had expected to find the ore. Thirlwell had not admitted this to Scott, because he shrank from stating his suspicions, which were dark but vague. Now, however, he thought he would try to formulate them and see how they looked, since he might, after all, take Scott into his confidence.|$|R
50|$|Littell {{said he was}} {{inspired}} to write the novel after seeing a photograph of Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, a Soviet partisan executed by the Nazis. He traces the original inspiration for the book from seeing Claude Lanzmann’s film Shoah, an acclaimed documentary about the Holocaust, in 1991. He began research for the book in 2001 and started the first draft eighteen months later, after he had read around two hundred books about Nazi Germany and the Eastern Front, as well as visiting Germany, East Europe and Caucasus. Littell claims that he undertook the creation of his main character, Aue, by <b>imagining</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> himself would have done had he been born in pre-war Germany and had become a Nazi.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} yet <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> aimed at, {{and told him}} I granted all he had said, and thanked {{him that he would}} so far concern himself for us: and begged he would explain the {{particulars}} of what he had observed, that like Joshua, to take his own parable, I might put away the accursed thing from us.|$|E
60|$|Uncle George took Jonas forward alone, {{until they}} were out of sight, and {{presently}} returned without him. Rollo asked where Jonas was gone, and his uncle told him that that was a secret at present. They heard, soon after, the strokes of his hatchet in the woods, on before them, but could not <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could be doing.|$|E
60|$|We {{need not}} repeat what Mr Jolly said, {{or try to}} <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> felt, on receipt of this letter! About {{the time it was}} put into his hands the {{magnificent}} steamer at the embarcadero gave a shrill whistle, then it panted violently, the paddles revolved,--and our adventurers were soon steaming swiftly down the noble river on their way to San Francisco.|$|E
5000|$|Working at {{a station}} {{where all the}} other {{employees}} are white, Venus sometimes worries that he is losing touch with black culture. There {{are a number of}} jokes that play on the fact that Venus is rather [...] "white" [...] in his cultural tastes: Dr. Johnny Fever sometimes seems to know more about black performers than Venus does, and in the episode [...] "Daydreams," [...] when Venus <b>imagines</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would like to be, he becomes a bland, unctuous Las Vegas stand-up comedian in the style of Joey Bishop. In the episode [...] "Real Families," [...] Venus is stunned to find out that co-worker Herb Tarlek has tried to score points with the titular TV series by claiming that he and Venus attend NAACP meetings together.|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of MA by Research (Creative Writing) OctoberThe horror genre invites challenges for the creative writer, new texts for its readers. A horror reader can only predict <b>what</b> <b>he’s</b> going to experience; through the glimpses of fear a horror writer might <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>he’s</b> going to write. This research thesis {{is an attempt to}} evaluate the horror genre from several different angles by simply reading and critiquing. It assesses the practice of being a horror writer, and evaluating areas of debate. Areas which carry less significance which need highlighting, a reflection upon personal poetics made between the writer and the text. Ultimately, new arguments were formed on the basis of what’s available in the field already, arguments which could be considered a contribution towards the horror genre...|$|R
40|$|Today, children”, {{a teacher}} announces, “we {{are going to}} draw a picture”. As one child excitedly <b>imagines</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> will draw, he is told {{that they will be}} drawing flowers. As he imagines the flower he will create, he is then told that a flower has a red bud and a straight, green stem. When he changes schools the followingyear and the teacher announces that the class will be drawing a picture, he awaits instruction. When he is told that the only {{guidelines}} are the limits of his imagination, he draws a flower with a red bud and a straight, green stem. Are reality and truth absolute, or historical and contextual, that is to say, pluralistic? In the same light, is there one or are there many ways to do philosophy...|$|R
60|$|The bells were ringing double peals, {{the guns}} roaring and banging most prodigiously. Bulbo was {{embracing}} everybody; the Lord Chancellor was flinging up his wig and shouting like a madman; Hedzoff had got the Archbishop round the waist, {{and they were}} dancing a jig for joy; and as for Giglio, I leave you to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>HE</b> was doing, and if he kissed Rosalba once, twice--twenty thousand times, I'm sure I don't think he was wrong.|$|E
6000|$|There is {{something}} in that word with its suggestions of guilt and retribution which arrests the thought. We feel ourselves {{in the presence of}} the power of organised society--a thing mysterious in itself and still more mysterious in its effect. Whether guilty or innocent, it was as if old de Barral had been down to the Nether Regions. Impossible to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would bring out from there to the light of this world of uncondemned men. What would he think? What would he have to say? And what was one to say to him? ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{tried to}} <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> WOULD do to a cub pilot {{who had been}} guilty of such a crime as mine, {{committed}} on a boat guard-deep with costly freight and alive with passengers. Our watch was nearly ended. I thought I would go and hide somewhere till I {{got a chance to}} slide ashore. So I slipped out of the pilot-house, and down the steps, and around to the texas door--and was in the act of gliding within, when the captain confronted me! I dropped my head, and he stood over me in silence a moment or two, then said impressively-- ...|$|E
60|$|An icy horror {{suddenly}} {{gripped his}} heart. Not daring to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> had occurred, <b>he</b> hurried on.

500|$|The {{music for}} [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] {{originated}} from a demo that guitarist The Edge composed {{the night before}} the group resumed The Joshua Tree sessions. In an upstairs room at Melbeach House—his newly purchased home—The Edge used a four-track tape machine to record an arrangement of keyboards, bass, guitar, and a drum machine. Realising that the album sessions were approaching the end and that the band were short on exceptional live songs, The Edge wanted to [...] "conjure up the ultimate U2 live-song", so <b>he</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would like to hear at a future U2 show if he were a fan. After finishing the rough mix, he felt he had come up with [...] "the most amazing guitar part and song of [...] life". With no one in the house to share the demo with, The Edge recalls dancing around and punching the air in celebration.|$|R
