However, Michael cannot even bring himself to do it. Dwight throws himself on the coals, refusing to leave until he is given the job, and he writhes in agony until he is dragged off.|$|E

25|$|On September 5, 2008, Todd and Marty share {{a passionate}} kiss as Todd helps <b>her</b> <b>walk.</b> He initiates the {{intimate}} contact, and viewers, {{as well as}} critics, argued that, given his sexual intimacy issues, {{it was out of}} character for him to be as sexually bold towards Marty; Marty being his rape victim had been the main source of his sexual hangups. On September 23, 2008, the show went further with intimacy between the two and had them almost engage in sex. Todd eventually backs away from the contact, presumably due to his conscience.|$|E
25|$|Virginia Woolf {{is taking}} <b>her</b> <b>walk</b> while {{thinking}} of ideas for her novel. She already believes Clarissa Dalloway will commit suicide, now Virginia plans for Mrs.Dalloway {{to have had}} one true love: not her husband, but a girl Clarissa knew during her own girlhood. Her love of another girl will have represented {{a time when she}} was not afraid to go against the destiny laid out for her by society and family. Virginia plans for Clarissa to kill herself in middle-age over something quite trivial, a representation of what her life has become and what has been repressed. As Virginia walks about Richmond she reflects on how Mrs.Dalloway's deterioration in middle-age represents how Virginia feels about being trapped in suburban Richmond when she only feels fully alive in London. She is aware she is more susceptible to mental illness in London, but would rather die 'raving mad' in London than avoid life (and perhaps prolong her years) in Richmond.|$|E

500|$|Laura Secord ( [...] Ingersoll; 13 September 1775– 17 October 1868) was a Canadian {{heroine of}} the War of 1812. [...] She {{is known for}} having walked [...] out of American-occupied {{territory}} in 1813 to warn British forces of an impending American attack. [...] Her contribution to the war was little known during her lifetime, but since her death she has been frequently honoured in Canada. [...] Though Secord had no relation to it, most Canadians associate her with the Laura Secord Chocolates company, named after her on the centennial of <b>her</b> <b>walk.</b>|$|E

500|$|Lead vocalist Mark Hall {{says that}} [...] "Praise You In This Storm" [...] was {{inspired}} by the band's experience with a young girl, Erin Browning. The band made arrangements to meet Erin, who had performed a dance at her public school to one of the band's songs, and her family on Valentine's Day 2004 before one of their concerts. Right around the time the band connected with Erin and her family was when she was found to have cancer. Erin died on November 1, 2004. According to Hall, [...] "Watching [...] walk through this really showed me truth about my worship. Watching <b>her</b> <b>walk</b> through a real storm showed me that my worship was extremely situational". Hall began writing the song before Erin's death and told her about it, but was not able to complete it before she died.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{opens with}} Stewie {{revealing}} {{his ability to}} travel across parallel universes to Brian. The first universe that they decide to visit, after having questioned the origin of Stewie's pedigree pig, is said to exist {{in a world where}} Christianity is absent. In this universe, everything is seemingly years in advance of the 21st century; Quagmire is able to take a single pill and be instantly cured of the AIDS virus, and flying cars and buildings surround them. As the two travel through the universe, they come upon Stewie's older sister Meg, who has become significantly more attractive. While they watch <b>her</b> <b>walk</b> down the street, the 1984 single [...] "Drop Dead Legs" [...] by Van Halen plays. Playing on the nonexistence of Christianity, Brian and Stewie visit the Sistine Chapel and discover that a large collection of photos of American actress Jodie Foster has been substituted for The Creation of Adam painting by Michelangelo, who was fired and replaced by John Hinckley.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{commentary}} {{regarding the}} music video focused on Cyrus' increasingly provocative image. Margaret Eby of Daily News stated that she [...] "just can't stop strutting her stuff" [...] and [...] " [...] several barely-there outfits in the three-minute video." [...] A writer for The Huffington Post shared a similar sentiment, adding that [...] "even though her wardrobe {{is full of}} crop tops and itty bitty shorts, Miley Cyrus' skimpy outfits still manage to shock." [...] A writer for Rap-Up provided a favorable review, complimenting Cyrus for [...] " [...] up the heat" [...] in the [...] "striking visuals". Writing for VH1, Emily Exton joked that [...] "hip-hop's fledgling relationship with a former Disney star just got a little stronger", and noted that [...] "Jay-Z may have encouraged Miley’s love of twerking with his [...] "Somewhereinamerica" [...] shout-out, but it appears Sean is less interested in seeing Billy Ray's daughter shake her thing than having <b>her</b> <b>walk</b> around in dazzling heels and stare the camera down {{in the name of}} art." ...|$|E
500|$|Secord wrote two {{accounts}} of <b>her</b> <b>walk,</b> {{the first in}} 1853, and the second in 1861. [...] Neither account contains details that can be corroborated with military {{accounts of}} the battle, such as specific dates or details about troops. Her account changed throughout her life. [...] Historian Pierre Berton noted that she never stated clearly how she learned of the impending attack. [...] She told FitzGibbon {{that her husband had}} learned about it from an American officer, but years later told her granddaughter that she had overheard the plans directly from the American soldiers billeted in her home. Berton suggested that Secord's informant could have been an American still residing in the United States, who would have been charged with treason had Secord revealed her source. [...] In the 1860s, as Secord's story gained prominence, historian William Foster Coffin added new details, which included the claim that Laura had brought a cow with her as an excuse to leave her home in case the American patrols questioned her.|$|E

500|$|Maggie has {{performed}} {{a number of}} feats that suggest she is a genius. She has spelled out E=MC² with her baby blocks, driven Homer's car, escaped from the Springfield daycare center, written her name on an Etch A Sketch, played Internet poker, and treated her pacifier like a cigarette. However, {{the rest of the}} Simpsons family are unaware of Maggie's maturity and Marge carries Maggie wherever they go rather than letting <b>her</b> <b>walk</b> by herself. Maggie is keenly aware of her surroundings, and can usually be seen imitating the flow of action around her. She shows a high degree of dexterity, and she once hit Homer on the head with a mallet and shot a dart at a photograph of him in imitation of Itchy and Scratchy. Despite her age, Maggie is a formidable marksman, as seen in [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" [...] where she shoots Mr. Burns with a handgun that falls into her hands, and in a more intentional manner during [...] "Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge" [...] where she is able to non-fatally shoot a group of mobsters in rapid succession with a rifle that she apparently hides in her crib.|$|E

2500|$|In 1988, {{after several}} years of tense relations, Abramović and Ulay decided to make a spiritual journey which would end their relationship. They each walked the Great Wall of China, in a piece called Lovers, {{starting}} from the two opposite ends and meeting in the middle. As Abramović described it: [...] "That walk became a complete personal drama. Ulay started from the Gobi Desert and I from the Yellow Sea. After each of us walked 2500km, we met in the middle and said good-bye." [...] She has said that she conceived this walk in a dream, and it provided what she thought was an appropriate, romantic ending to a relationship full of mysticism, energy, and attraction. She later described the process: [...] "We needed a certain form of ending, after this huge distance walking towards each other. It is very human. It is in a way more dramatic, more like a film ending... Because in the end you are really alone, whatever you do." [...] She reported that during <b>her</b> <b>walk</b> she was reinterpreting her connection to the physical world and to nature. She felt that the metals in the ground influenced her mood and state of being; she also pondered the Chinese myths in which the Great Wall {{has been described as a}} [...] "dragon of energy." [...] It took the couple eight years to acquire permission from the Chinese government to perform the work, by the time of which their relationship had completely dissolved.|$|E
