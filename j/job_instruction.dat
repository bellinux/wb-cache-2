This study was a crosssectional survey. We sent self-administered questionnaires to 126 workplaces in the western part of Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan in August 2006. The questionnaire included the characteristics of the workplace, barriers to employing immigrant workers, current actions to keep immigrant workers healthy and safe, the implementation rate of health checkups and important issues to keep immigrant workers healthy and safe. Implementation rates of health and safety education, creating <b>job</b> <b>instruction</b> manuals written in their native languages, creating safety signs written in their native languages, and the use of translators were 62. 5 %, 50. 0 %, 41. 1 % and 37. 5 %, respectively.

The most important issue which the managers considered kept immigrant workers healthy and safe was health checkups (69. 6 %).

O objetivo deste estudo foi comparar a condição periodontal em 30 pares de mães e crianças com dentição mista, através dos índices de placa e gengival, bem como verificar sua correlação com alguns aspectos sociais e hábitos de higiene oral. No exame clínico foram registrados o índice de placa (IP) e índice gengival (IG) e, em seguida, foram realizadas tomadas radiográficas periapicais e interproximais que possibilitaram avaliar a possível presença de perdas ósseas em mães e crianças. Através de questionários, foram colhidas informações a respeito dos hábitos de higiene oral das mães e crianças, nível de escolaridade da mãe, se a mãe trabalhava fora e a renda familiar. Após análise estatística (Teste de Correlação de Pearson; test t de Student; Análise de Covariância), concluiu-se que houve maior correlação entre os índices de placa e gengival composto por adultos do que no grupo de crianças. Não foi encontrada correlação significante entre os índices de placa e gengival nos pares de mães e crianças. Não foi encontrada nenhuma correlação significante entre perda óssea e os índices de placa ou gengival dos pares. O índice de placa total das mães aumentou a idade e diminuiu quando a mãe utilizava fio dental diariamente e quando esta trabalhava fora. O índice gengival total das mães também foi reduzido quando elas trabalhavam fora. Houve redução no índice de placa total da criança quando a mãe a auxiliava durante a escovação, quando a mãe utilizava fio dental diariamente e quando esta trabalhava fora.

A pilot study utilizing 248 subjects was conducted to examine the reliability and content validity of the instruments. The pilot study indicated that all instruments had acceptable reliability and validity estimates. ^ Two hundred and forty-seven (247) subordinates from various for-profit organizations participated in the research study by completing questionnaires evaluating their superiors. Reliability and validity checks were completed for all instruments. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the predictor variables Communicator Image, <b>Job</b> <b>Instructions</b> and Performance Feedback best predicted Perceived Supervisory Performance. The predictor variables Performance Feedback, Communicator Image, Dominance, Organizational Procedures and Practices and Dramatic best predicted Satisfaction with One 2 ̆ 7 s Supervisor. The predictor variables Communicator Image, Performance Feedback, Organizational Goals, Dominance and Job Rationale best predicted Quality of Superior-Subordinate Relationship. The predictor variables Performance Feedback, <b>Job</b> <b>Instructions,</b> Communicator Image and Organizational Goals best predicted Quality of Supervisory Communication. ^ The results support the premise that superior-subordinate communication is made up of two interdependent components. The results indicate that the instruments developed for this study are appropriate for investigating superior-subordinate communication and relationships.

Ambiguity is especially serious in those functional areas where managerial positions inclined to be less concrete in nature and need more abstract thinking and decision making.

50|$|Nuclear {{criticality}} {{safety is}} a field of nuclear engineering dedicated to the prevention of nuclear and radiation accidents resulting from an inadvertent, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. Additionally, nuclear criticality safety is concerned with mitigating {{the consequences of a}} nuclear criticality accident. A nuclear criticality accident occurs from operations that involve fissile material and results in a sudden and potentially lethal release of radiation. Nuclear criticality safety practitioners attempt to prevent nuclear criticality accidents by analyzing normal and credible abnormal conditions in fissile material operations and designing safe arrangements for the processing of fissile materials. A common practice is to apply a double contingency analysis to the operation in which two or more independent, concurrent and unlikely changes in process conditions must occur before a nuclear criticality accident can occur. For example, the first change in conditions may be complete or partial flooding and the second change a re-arrangement of the fissile material. Controls (requirements) on process parameters (e.g., fissile material mass, equipment) result from this analysis. These controls, either passive (physical), active (mechanical), or administrative (human), are implemented by inherently safe or fault-tolerant plant designs, or, if such designs are not practicable, by administrative controls such as operating procedures, <b>job</b> <b>instructions</b> and other means to minimize the potential for significant process changes {{that could lead to a}} nuclear criticality accident.|$|R

To minimise quality errors and save time computerbased training virtual training {{can be used to}} practice on product knowledge, variants and sequences. Currently in traditional training in automotive industries, the operators practice on psychical products. The purpose of this bachelor thesis is to obtain knowledge of the effects of virtual training with cycle times longer than five minutes by evaluate the virtual training methods at Scania in Södertälje, Sweden. To achieve the purpose of the thesis the objective is to create a basis of the advantages and disadvantages. Scania is part of the Volkswagen Group and is a world leading supplier in the automotive industry which develops custom made and high-quality products with short lead times. Scania’s core products are heavy trucks, buses and engines for marine and industrial applications. Scania has 46 000 employees in 100 countries. Today Scania use standardised work and <b>Job</b> <b>Instructions</b> Training tools for learning the assembling processes which could be time consuming, ineffective and resource-intensive. Therefore, Scania’s vision with virtual training is to shorten the learning time on-line by implementing virtual training to practice off-line. The main objectives are to reduce the time for training simultaneously as the product quality increases. To obtain reliable information to reach the purpose a qualitative approach has been used in the study. To obtain primary data the methods have been semi-structured interviews, observation and questionnaires that have been performed and literature studies have been used to collect secondary data to obtain a broad knowledge of the subject. Through this the bachelor thesis resulted in recommendations that will contribute to Scania’s decision of future work with virtual training. The recommendations have been based on the previous accomplished studies, results and obtained comments which together were connected in the discussion and by the recommendations the authors believe that Scania can use virtual training with success. ...|$|R
