5|$|The book {{begins with}} Arthur Penhaligon and Leaf {{attempting}} {{to return to}} Earth after their adventures in the Border Sea. While Leaf is able {{to pass through the}} front door and return to Earth, the presence of a Nithling duplicate of Arthur prevents him <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> so, and he is forced to remain in the Lower House.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} plot involves Merital and {{his desire}} to marry a woman named Helena, cousin to Matchless. He is kept <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> so externally by her uncle, Sir Positive Trap, by the workings of her aunt, and internally by themselves. Against her uncles wishes, Helena and Merital elope. Although Trap is angered by this, Lady Matchless steps in and defends the marriage by saying that she too will marry like her cousin. The play ends with a song about beauty, virtue, and lovers.|$|E
5|$|A typical McKinsey {{engagement}} {{can last}} {{between two and}} twelve months and involves three to six McKinsey consultants. An engagement is usually managed by a generalist that covers the region the client's headquarters are located in and specialists that have either an industry or functional expertise. Unlike some competing consulting firms, McKinsey does not hold a policy against working for multiple competing companies (although individual consultants are barred <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> so). This has sometimes led to accusations of sharing confidential information or re-packaging a competitor's tactics as best practices.|$|E

In 2014 a {{controversy}} was sparked when an interviewer for Cuatro TV {{asked her how}} come she spoke so well 'in spite of coming <b>from</b> <b>Dos</b> Hermanas'. This sparked a large debate on classism and Madrid-centric snobbery.http://sevilla.abc.es/provincia-dos-hermanas/20140827/sevi-como-siendo-hermanas-hablas-201408271515.html ...|$|R

5|$|Although his new club {{began the}} 2001–02 season strongly, topping the First Division table and looking well placed for regaining the Premier League place that the club had last {{held in the}} 1997–98 season, Bruce {{tendered}} his resignation {{less than three months}} into the season in order to return to Birmingham City as manager. Although he was initially prevented <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> so by an injunction taken out by Crystal Palace, he was eventually allowed to join the Midlands-based club after a compensation package was agreed. By now he had acquired a reputation as a manager who rarely held down a job for a significant length of time.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the main}} reasons that experts cite for causing {{negative}} effects from yoga are beginners' competitiveness and instructors' lack of qualification. As the demand for yoga classes grows, many people get certified to become yoga instructors, often with relatively little training. Not every newly certified instructor can evaluate the condition of every new trainee in their class and recommend refraining <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> certain poses or using appropriate props to avoid injuries. In turn, a beginning yoga student can overestimate the abilities of their body and strive to do advanced poses before their body is flexible or strong enough to perform them.|$|E
5|$|An {{injunction}} is {{an equitable}} private law remedy that restrains a public body <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> {{an act that}} is wrongful or ultra vires. Following law reforms in the United Kingdom in 1977, it became possible for the High Court of England and Wales to grant prerogative orders {{as well as a}} declaration or injunction in the same set of legal proceedings. As these reforms have not been followed in Singapore, the Singapore High Court is not empowered to grant injunctions under Order 53 of the Rules of Court.|$|E

5|$|At the mansion, Mona knocks Max to {{the ground}} in an attempt to follow her orders to kill him, but discovers that her {{feelings}} for him keep her <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> so. Lem then shoots Mona, after realizing that she will not kill Max. Woden confronts Lem, who shoots him to death in the ensuing struggle. Max and Lem then fight while the mansion burns around them. Eventually, Lem is killed and Max returns to Mona's side as the police arrive, and she dies in his arms.

5|$|Bokhary's {{vehicle was}} {{involved}} in a head-on collision with a bus on Stubbs Road shortly after midnight on 27 January 2010. She refused paramedics' attempts to put her on a stretcher, returned to her vehicle, and continued to refuse to cooperate. She then attempted {{to walk away from the}} scene, but was prevented <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> so by a male police officer, whom she then slapped. She was handcuffed and charged with careless driving, refusing a breathalyser test, and two counts of assault on a police officer. She was released on HK$5,000 bail.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Zara Yaqob also {{continued}} as the {{defender of the}} Patriarch of Alexandria. When he heard in 1441 {{of the destruction of}} the Egyptian monastery of Debre Mitmaq by Sultan Az-Zahir Sayf-ad-Din Jaqmaq, he called for a period of mourning, then sent a letter of strong protest to the Sultan. He reminded Jaqmaq that he had Muslim subjects whom he treated fairly, and warned that he had the power to divert the Nile, but refrained <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> so for the human suffering it would cause. Jaqmaq responded with gifts to appease Zara Yaqob's anger, but refused to rebuild the Coptic Churches he had destroyed.|$|E

5|$|George was {{succeeded by}} his son, George Augustus, {{who took the}} throne as George II. It was widely assumed, even by Walpole for a time, that George II planned to remove Walpole from office but was {{prevented}} <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> so by his queen, Caroline of Ansbach. However, Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George II {{had little choice but}} to retain him or risk ministerial instability. In subsequent reigns the power of the prime minister increased further at the expense of the power of the sovereign.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh-Fleetwood {{moved to}} London with Virginie {{and their son}} Louis. He rarely visited Lancashire again, and in 1847 he retired from politics. The family spent some time living in Virginie's home country, Spain. In 1861 Hesketh-Fleetwood {{expressed}} an intention to return to politics, but was prevented <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> so by his failing health. He died {{at his home in}} Piccadilly, London on 12 April 1866, following a lengthy illness. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. His son Rev. Peter Louis Hesketh-Fleetwood (1838–1880) succeeded to the baronetcy, which became extinct on his death. What was left of Hesketh-Fleetwood's land in Lancashire was bought by the Fleetwood Estate Company in 1875.|$|E
5|$|Imaginative spectators {{would climb}} {{the church and}} watch a {{football}} game from the rooftop however they have now been deterred <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> so with the installation of security measures such as barbed wire and anti-climb paint.

The previous day, they attempted to play a surprise set at a free anti-RNC concert at the Minnesota Capitol in St. Paul, but were prevented <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> so by the police. Instead, de la Rocha and Morello rapped and sang through a megaphone. Later that evening, Morello and Boots Reilly joined up with Billy Bragg and Jim Walsh for a three-hour jam session at Pepitos Parkway theater in south Minneapolis.|$|E
5|$|It is {{said that}} the MacIntyre chief {{at the time of}} the Jacobite rising of 1745, James (born c. 1727), would have joined the clans {{rallying}} to Prince Charles Edward Stuart but was dissuaded <b>from</b> <b>doing</b> so by his wife, who was a Campbell, and his neighbors. His loyalties to the Campbells were further deepened by the fact that his legal studies had been sponsored by the Campbell Earl of Breadalbane. Nonetheless, many MacIntyres were in the clan regiment of Stewart of Appin in the campaign of 1745–46, but they did not serve as an independent body.|$|E

Ralph and Vanellope agree to work together by building a race kart for Vanellope to win a race and retrieve the medal.|$|E
