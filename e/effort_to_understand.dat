5|$|The {{discovery}} that enzymes could be crystallized eventually allowed their structures {{to be solved}} by x-ray crystallography. This was first done for lysozyme, an enzyme found in tears, saliva and egg whites that digests the coating of some bacteria; the structure was solved by a group led by David Chilton Phillips and published in 1965. This high-resolution structure of lysozyme {{marked the beginning of}} the field of structural biology and the <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> how enzymes work at an atomic level of detail.|$|E

25|$|Early successes such {{as these}} {{paved the way for}} {{dynamical}} systems research into linguistic acquisition, answering many questions about early linguistic development but leaving many others unanswered, such as how these statistically acquired lexemes are represented. Of particular importance in recent research has been the <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the dynamic interaction of learning (e.g. language-based) and learner (e.g. speaker-based) variables in lexical organization and competition in bilinguals. In the ceaseless effort to move toward more psychologically realistic models, many researchers have turned to a subset of associative models, self-organizing maps (SOMs), as established, cognitively plausible models of language development.|$|E
25|$|In an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> Elena's abilities, Nyle {{subjects}} her {{to daily}} therapy sessions, which {{take the form}} of interrogations, during which Elena only communicates by way of telepathic demands to see her father. By night, Elena is kept in a brightly lit, completely white room, with only a television for companionship. Nyle spends his own nights at home with his wife, a docile, servile woman who gives Nyle endless praise and exists in a state of constant stupor. Nyle takes massive quantities of prescription medication and disguises his complete lack of hair and the color of his irises by way of an elaborate wig and contact lenses.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s and '60s, psychologists began {{studying}} gender development in young children, partially in an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{the origins of}} homosexuality (which {{was viewed as a}} mental disorder at the time). In 1958, the Gender Identity Research Project was established at the UCLA Medical Center for the study of intersex and transsexual individuals. Psychoanalyst Robert Stoller generalized many of the findings of the project in his book Sex and Gender: On the Development of Masculinity and Femininity (1968). He is also credited with introducing the term gender identity to the International Psychoanalytic Congress in Stockholm, Sweden in 1963. Behavioral psychologist John Money was also instrumental in the development of early theories of gender identity. His work at Johns Hopkins Medical School's Gender Identity Clinic (established in 1965) popularized an interactionist theory of gender identity, suggesting that, up to a certain age, gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation. His book Man and Woman, Boy and Girl (1972) became widely used as a college textbook, although many of Money's ideas have since been challenged.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s it was {{discovered}} that illuminated organic dyes can generate electricity at oxide electrodes in electrochemical cells. In an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> and simulate the primary processes in photosynthesis the phenomenon was studied at the University of California at Berkeley with chlorophyll extracted from spinach (bio-mimetic or bionic approach). On the basis of such experiments electric power generation via the dye sensitization solar cell (DSSC) principle was demonstrated and discussed in 1972. The instability of the dye solar cell was identified as a main challenge. Its efficiency could, during the following two decades, be improved by optimizing the porosity of the electrode prepared from fine oxide powder, but the instability remained a problem. A modern DSSC is composed of a porous layer of titanium dioxide nanoparticles, covered with a molecular dye that absorbs sunlight, like the chlorophyll in green leaves. The titanium dioxide is immersed under an electrolyte solution, above which is a platinum-based catalyst. As in a conventional alkaline battery, an anode (the titanium dioxide) and a cathode (the platinum) are placed on either side of a liquid conductor (the electrolyte).|$|E

This resulted in a monograph titled The City, which was probably compiled from research conducted in 1911–13, and which was published posthumously in 1921. In 1924 it was incorporated into the second part of his Economy and Society, as chapter XVI, [...] "The City (Non-legitimate Domination)".|$|E

2500|$|At the Universidad de Zaragoza Asín had met {{and begun}} study under the Arabist Professor Julián Ribera y Tarragó.

Asín then developed {{his study of}} Al-Ghazali, and published it in 1901. He also wrote on Mohidin Abenarabe, who is often called the leading figure in Islamic mysticism. Thus Asín was running parallel with a then European-wide <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> Muslim inner spirituality.|$|E
2500|$|According to Karl Marx, {{the father}} of [...] "scientific socialism", {{religion}} is a tool used by the ruling classes whereby the masses can shortly relieve their suffering via the act of experiencing religious emotions. It {{is in the interest}} of the ruling classes to instill in the masses the religious conviction that their current suffering will lead to eventual happiness. Therefore, as long as the public believes in religion, they will not attempt to make any genuine <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> and overcome the real source of their suffering, which in Marx's opinion was their capitalist economic system. In this perspective, Marx saw religion as escapism.|$|E
