25|$|The Prince {{ordered his}} Tercios of Spaniards {{march to the}} village of Cerisy, located a league south of Bray, and cross there the river.

The Régiment de Piedmont, reinforced by a company of the Régiment des Gardes, tried to expel them from the pontoons and the road of faggots with great fierceness, but thanks to the presence of the Prince, who took the command of the attack, the Spaniards managed to cross the river and drove off the Régiment de Piemont from the riverside.|$|E
25|$|The Prince put {{on alert}} his Maestres de Campo and Colonels and set route to Bray.

The Count of Soissons, who were stationed with his troops on a nearby hill, believed that the Spanish were attempting to cross the river <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>place</b> and detached its battalions and squadrons near the riverside to reject every attempt. The Marquis of Fontenay, who led these troops, set fire to the village and entrenched his soldiers in a series of forts built in the riverside. The skirmish continued a long time with artillery and musketry fire. According to the French, only 20 of his soldiers were killed, among them the Comte de Matha, captain of a company of the Régiment des Gardes.|$|E
