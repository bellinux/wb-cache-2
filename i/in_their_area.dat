5|$|The {{attack was}} universally {{condemned}} by Australian servicemen, who commonly {{believed that the}} attack on Centaur had been carried out deliberately and in full knowledge of her status. Similar reactions were expressed by other Allied personnel; United States Army Air Forces General George Kenney recalled having to talk a sergeant bombardier out of organising a retaliatory bombing run on a Japanese hospital ship known to be <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} game's early promotion, a {{scavenger}} hunt contest {{was announced}} {{in the last week}} of May 2009. Players would need to search for articles on specific game-related sites to find information on the bands that are to be in Guitar Hero 5, and then enter those bands at the game's official website for a chance to win a series of concert tickets <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>area.</b> Through this promotion, a large number of artists in the final track list were revealed.|$|E
5|$|In September, it {{was placed}} {{under the command of}} the newly formed XV Mountain Corps led by Lüters. That month, the {{division}} concluded a collaboration agreement with the 260-strong Chetnik detachment of Mane Rokvić, who was in control of an area which included parts of both western Bosnia and Lika. The division utilised the Chetniks to protect railway lines and key industries <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>area,</b> as well as for scouting against the Partisans and attacks on the rear of Partisan formations. Desertions worsened particularly after the capitulation of Italy in early September 1943. For example, during October 1943, 334 men deserted from the division. It handled thousands of Italian prisoners {{in the aftermath of the}} surrender, feeding them and marching them under guard towards the Reich.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} 20 {{years of the}} BAA/NBA, the league {{was still trying to}} gain the support of fans who lived in or near the teams' home markets. To achieve this, the league {{introduced}} the territorial pick rule to help teams acquire popular players from colleges <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>area</b> who would presumably have strong local support. Before the draft, a team could forfeit its first-round draft pick and then select any player from within a 50-mile radius of its home arena. Although the territorial picks were selected before the draft, these picks were not factored into the overall selection count of the draft; therefore, the first non-territorial pick of the draft was considered the first overall pick.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the same}} day Haldane ordered US 1/28th Battalion to closely explore the tunnels <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>area</b> of operations, {{uncovering}} a number chambers and trapdoors defended by grenades and booby traps. A Company subsequently located another tunnel system after an American {{was killed by a}} Viet Cong soldier who suddenly appeared out of a large anthill. Later, as the 1/503rd continued to search its area with platoon-size patrols during the afternoon of 13 January, a clash between Company C and a Viet Cong platoon developed into a heavy contact. An air-strike was successfully called in by the Americans however, and a search of the area recovered 10 dead Viet Cong, while blood trails and human remains indicated that perhaps another 20 were also killed.|$|E

All stations on the branch are unstaffed, and at first lacked any ticket issuing facilities; but in late 2009 a Scheidt & Bachmann Ticket XPress self-service ticket machine was installed at each station.|$|E

5|$|Olfactory {{navigation}} {{has been}} suggested as a possible mechanism in pigeons. Papi's 'mosaic' model argues that pigeons build and remember a mental map of the odours <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>area,</b> recognizing where they are by the local odour. Wallraff's 'gradient' model argues {{that there is a}} steady, large-scale gradient of odour which remains stable for long periods. If there were two or more such gradients in different directions, pigeons could locate themselves in two dimensions by the intensities of the odours. However {{it is not clear that}} such stable gradients exist. Papi did find evidence that anosmic pigeons (unable to detect odours) were much less able to orient and navigate than normal pigeons, so olfaction does seem to be important in pigeon navigation. However, it is not clear how olfactory cues are used.|$|E
5|$|PAGASA issued {{their final}} {{advisory}} later on September 16. Peak intensity for Typhoon Luis {{as reported by}} PAGASA while it was <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>area</b> of responsibility was only 80knots (150km/h, 95mph). Shanshan made landfall on September 17 {{on the island of}} Kyūshū. The HKO issued their final track forecast on the weakening typhoon later that day as it passed out of their area of responsibility, with the peak intensity while within HKO's area of responsibility set at 185km/h (115mph, 100kt). The JTWC declared the system extratropical shortly after.|$|E
5|$|The {{curriculum}} emphasizes writing; {{students are}} required to complete a semester project each term on a topic chosen in conjunction with an advisor, and are required to complete a research paper during their third year. All students must pass a basic-studies comprehensive examination to register for upper-level courses, and at least one area-studies comprehensive examination (usually <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>area</b> of concentration) to graduate. A senior thesis is required of all students. Usually an analytic or expository essay, it may also be a piece of original fiction, poetry, a performance or work of visual art. Students are encouraged to present their theses orally, and the public is invited to the presentations.|$|E

All local government officials are employees of the central government's Ministry of Territorial Administration, from which local governments also get most of their budgets.|$|E
5|$|In April 1945, {{after months}} of {{lobbying}} by Potts—who was keen {{to get back into}} action himself after having been relieved of his previous command during the Kokoda campaign—the 7th Battalion was transferred to Torokina on Bougainville Island, where the Japanese garrison was still holding out. In June they moved up the Numa Numa Trail to Pearl Ridge in the central sector of the island where they relieved the 27th Battalion. Almost immediately they began aggressive patrols in order to dominate the Japanese <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>area</b> of operations and were tasked with the capture of several key positions including Wearne's Hill, Base Point 3, Tokua and Sisivie and to establish a forward position in the Wakunai Valley. Over {{the course of the next}} three months until the end of the war, the battalion captured 25 positions and killed around 200 Japanese soldiers.|$|E
5|$|In early 1612, {{the year}} of the trials, every justice of the peace (JP) in Lancashire was ordered to compile a list of recusants <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>area,</b> i.e. those who refused to attend the English Church and to take communion, a {{criminal}} offence at that time. Roger Nowell of Read Hall, on the edge of Pendle Forest, was the JP for Pendle. It was against this background of seeking out religious nonconformists that, in March 1612, Nowell investigated a complaint made to him by the family of John Law, a pedlar, who claimed to have been injured by witchcraft. Many of those who subsequently became implicated as the investigation progressed did indeed consider themselves to be witches, in the sense of being village healers who practised magic, probably in return for payment, but such men and women were common in 16th-century rural England, an accepted part of village life.|$|E

5|$|After {{shedding}} {{the burden}} of less profitable and unwieldy land with its angry residents, Burnside was on its own. The new Burnside District Council held its first meeting at the Greengate Inn, Tusmore on 19 August 1856. Due to {{the time it took}} to elect new councillors, it was not until 29 December that the council met again. Dr Christopher Penfold, chairman, met the rest of the representatives there: Daniel Ferguson of Glenunga, Alexander Ferguson of Monreith, John Townsend of Magill and James Grylls of Belle Vue. It was during this time that Kent Town decided against becoming a part of Burnside and instead applied to enter the Corporate Town of Kensington and Norwood. The council was to meet at the Inn or at Ferguson's home right up until December 1869, when the first council chambers were built. However, it was still able to operate and fulfill its obligations under the Local Government Act 1852. These included the management of minor roads, the administration of abattoir licences and public houses, and the prevention of the spread of the noxious Scotch thistle. The council was also obliged, under a different act of 1851, to encourage education. Much road and bridgework activity happened after the council had been formed—early residents were amazed at the influx of development and construction that occurred. At the same time, the council was almost overwhelmed by the amount of work requested, and was forced to ask individual ratepayers for monetary assistance when building bridges <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
