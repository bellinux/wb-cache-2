5|$|He {{was born}} in 1738 {{in the city of}} Blesen. The exact date, and {{information}} about his family are unknown, as any relevant documents have been lost. <b>He</b> <b>likely</b> had beyond basic education, and some sum of money when he left Bledzew and traveled to Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} of Foliot's education, but <b>he</b> <b>likely</b> received an education to fit him for his career in the church. Bibliographers have frequently confused him with his predecessor as bishop, Robert of Melun, so he has mistakenly been given as the author of a number of documents.|$|E
5|$|Piattoli {{developed}} {{contacts with}} notable {{figures on the}} Polish political scene, initially from the group opposed to the royal faction. By {{the end of his}} stay in Paris, <b>he</b> <b>likely</b> became a supporter of reforms in France and Poland, and begun taking his first serious steps in political activism, through the involvement in the Quattuowirat, a group of magnates planning a (never realized) confederacy. He became a foreign member of the Société des Amis des Noirs.|$|E

5|$|The first Olimpick Games were {{probably}} held in 1612, organised by lawyer Robert Dover, although different sources give dates from 1601 until 1612. Little {{is known about}} Dover. He was probably born between 1575 and 1582 in Norfolk, one of four children born to John Dover, {{and may have been}} admitted to Queens' College at Cambridge in 1583, leaving early to avoid swearing the Oath of Supremacy. Dover was admitted to Gray's Inn on 27February 1636, and was probably called to the bar in 1611, the same year <b>he</b> <b>likely</b> moved to Saintbury, near Chipping Campden, with his wife and children.|$|E
5|$|A {{story was}} told that Ælfric {{introduced}} monks into the cathedral church of Christ Church, Canterbury, replacing the secular clerks that {{had taken over the}} foundation during the ninth century. Ælfric is said to have done this on the command of the pope. This story originally dates to soon after the Norman Conquest and originated with the monastic historians of Canterbury, and its veracity is unclear. <b>He</b> <b>likely</b> performed the marriage ceremony of King Æthelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy in 1002. A later tradition held that he consecrated a Bishop of Llandaff and two Bishops of St. David's in Wales, which, if true, would have meant extending Canterbury's jurisdiction into new territory.|$|E
5|$|After college he {{rejoined the}} Naval Reserve {{with the aim}} of {{becoming}} an officer. Shortly after receiving his commission acceptance letter, his local bishop asked him to serve as a counselor in the bishopric. Time conflicts with bishopric meetings would have made Navy service impossible. After discussion with church apostle Harold B. Lee (his former stake president), Monson declined the commission and applied for a discharge. The Navy granted his discharge in the last group processed before the Korean War. Lee set him apart six months later as a bishop—mentioning in the blessing that <b>he</b> <b>likely</b> would not have been called if he had accepted the commission.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} other Black Paintings, Goya began with a black {{background}} which he painted over with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in {{the figure of the}} Devil. Like the other works in the series, Witches' Sabbath is worked up through heavy, slashing brushstrokes. The plaster was underlaid with thick carbon black before the paint was applied in hues of white lead, Prussian blue, vermilion of mercury, and crystals of powdered glass, orpiment and iron oxides. <b>He</b> <b>likely</b> worked with mixed materials. Technical analysis indicates that most of the Black Paintings begun with preparatory drawings. Witches' Sabbath is the exception; the final composition seems to have been painted directly onto the wall.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the names}} of the eight players had been kept secret, the general public was not {{informed}} that Bruce Smith, who had developed into one of the best defensive players in the country, {{would not be able to}} participate in the 1984 Independence Bowl. Only when Smith filed suit to force Virginia Tech and the NCAA to allow him to play in the game was the situation revealed. Dr. Cecil Lloyd, chairman of the Independence Bowl, announced at the time of the lawsuit that had he known about the restrictions on Smith, <b>he</b> <b>likely</b> would not have invited Tech to play in the game.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after he}} {{finished}} his education, he served for two years as rector of the collegiate school at St. John's Church in Warsaw. From October 1557 he tutored Jan Tęczyński, son of magnate Andrzej Tęczyński, and visited Vienna with his pupil, where <b>he</b> <b>likely</b> became closely acquainted with the Society of Jesus, a key order of the counter-reformation. He then returned to Poland, which {{emerged as one of}} the main terrains of struggle between the Protestant Reformation movement and the Catholic Church's counter-reformation. From 1562 he served as a parson in Rohatyn, and around 1564 he took holy orders. That year he became a canon, and the following year he also served as chancellor of the Lwów chapter. From 1566 to 1567 he was chaplain at the court of castellan Jan Krzysztof Tarnowski (the royal secretary to King Sigismund II Augustus); after Tarnowski's death he returned to Lwów, taking up the position of the cathedral preacher.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1764, five Cherokee visited Timberlake, seeking an {{audience}} with the governor of Virginia and requesting passage to London. The Cherokee wished to appeal to King George to enforce the Proclamation Line of 1763, which restricted colonists to east of the Appalachians, due to continuing encroachment by white settlers on Cherokee land. The governor denied their request, but Timberlake agreed to help them. He accompanied three Cherokee to London {{in the fall of}} 1764. Not long after their arrival, the benefactor of the trip fell ill and died. Lord Halifax refused to grant the Cherokee an audience, as the trip was unauthorized. Timberlake was accused of attempting to profit off the public attention given to the Cherokee. The government sent the Cherokee back to North America in March 1765. Shortly after their departure, Timberlake was arrested for failing to pay the debt for the last bill for lodging of himself and the Cherokee. <b>He</b> <b>likely</b> wrote his Memoirs while incarcerated.|$|E
5|$|The Northumbrian king, Æthelred, {{was assassinated}} in April 796, and {{less than a month}} later his successor, Osbald, was deposed in favour of Eardwulf. Eardwulf had Alhmund killed in 800; Alhmund was the son of King Alhred of Northumbria, who had reigned from 765 to 774. Alhmund's death was {{regarded}} as a martyrdom, and his cult subsequently developed at Derby, in Mercian territory, perhaps implying Mercian involvement in Northumbrian politics at the time. Coenwulf gave hospitality to Eardwulf's enemies, who had been exiled from Northumbria, and consequently Eardwulf invaded Mercia in 801. The invasion was inconclusive, however, and peace was arranged on equal terms. Coenwulf may also have been behind the coup in 806 that led to Eardwulf losing his throne, and <b>he</b> <b>likely</b> continued to support Eardwulf's enemies after Eardwulf returned in 808.|$|E
5|$|The bookwheel, in {{its most}} {{commonly}} seen form, was invented by Italian military engineer Agostino Ramelli in 1588, presented {{as one of the}} 195 designs in Le diverse et artificiose machine del Capitano Agostino Ramelli (The various and ingenious machines of Captain Agostino Ramelli). To ensure that the books remained at a constant angle, Ramelli incorporated an epicyclic gearing arrangement, a complex device that had only previously been used in astronomical clocks. Ramelli's design is unnecessarily elaborate, as <b>he</b> <b>likely</b> understood that gravity could have worked just as effectively (as it does with a Ferris wheel, invented centuries later), but the gearing system allowed him to display his mathematical prowess. While other people would go on to build bookwheels based on Ramelli's design, Ramelli did not in fact ever construct his own.|$|E

5|$|These events {{threatened}} Serbia, {{which had}} severed ties with Catholicism and {{was once again}} fully Orthodox. The marriage alliance between Vladislav and Ivan Asen II may {{be a result of}} the Hungarian threat to both of the rulers' countries. Some scholars have speculated that Vladislav accepted Bulgarian suzerainty, but this speculation has no evidence to support it, since no contemporary sources say that Vladislav recognized Asen as overlord of Serbia. However, Asen likely had the largest influence on the politics of Vladislav. Vladislav seems to have been left out of Orthodox alliance founded by Asen. Vladislav may have been afraid of close ties with Bulgaria, since his brother Radoslav's close ties with the Despotate of Epirus had caused dissatisfaction among the Serbian nobility. This shows that Vladislav was not too dependent upon Bulgaria, as he was not obliged to join the alliance; if he had recognized the suzerainty of Asen, <b>he</b> <b>likely</b> would have forced to join the alliance.|$|E
5|$|Władysław IV owed nominal {{allegiance}} to the Imperial Habsburgs {{as a member of}} the Order of the Golden Fleece. His relationship with the Habsburgs was relatively strong; although he was not above carrying some negotiations with their enemies, like France, he refused Cardinal Richelieu's 1635 proposal of an alliance and a full-out war against them, despite potential lure of territorial gains in Silesia. He realized that such a move would cause much unrest in a heavily Catholic Commonwealth, that <b>he</b> <b>likely</b> lacked the authority and power to push such a change of policy through the Sejm, and that the resulting conflict would be very difficult. From 1636 onward, for the next few years, Władysław strengthened his ties with the Habsburgs.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} at the Battle of Stiklestad, Harald {{managed to escape}} {{with the aid of}} Rögnvald Brusason (later Earl of Orkney) to a remote farm in Eastern Norway. He stayed there for some time to heal his wounds, and {{thereafter}} (possibly up to a month later) journeyed north over the mountains to Sweden. A year after the Battle of Stiklestad, Harald arrived in Kievan Rus' (referred to in the sagas as Garðaríki or Svíþjóð hin mikla). <b>He</b> <b>likely</b> spent at least part of his time in the town of Staraya Ladoga (Aldeigjuborg), arriving there {{in the first half of}} 1031. Harald and his men were welcomed by Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise, whose wife Ingegerd was a distant relative of Harald. Badly in need of military leaders, Yaroslav recognised a military potential in Harald and made him a captain of his forces. Harald's brother Olaf Haraldsson had previously been in exile to Yaroslav following the revolt in 1028, and Morkinskinna says that Yaroslav embraced Harald first and foremost because he was the brother of Olaf. Harald took part in Yaroslav's campaign against the Poles in 1031, and possibly also fought against other 1030s Kievan enemies and rivals such as the Chudes in Estonia, the Byzantines, as well as the Pechenegs and other steppe nomad people.|$|E

25|$|Hugo Kołłątaj {{was born}} on 1 April 1750 in Dederkały Wielkie in Volhynia to a family of minor Polish nobility; soon {{afterwards}} {{his family moved to}} Nieciesławice near Sandomierz, where he spent his childhood. He attended a school in Pińczów. He began his studies at the Kraków Academy (the later Jagiellonian University), where he studied law. Afterwards, around 1775 he took holy orders, then spent time in Vienna and Italy (Naples and Rome), where <b>he</b> <b>likely</b> encountered Enlightenment philosophy. <b>He</b> <b>likely</b> had doctorates from philosophy, law and theology.|$|E
