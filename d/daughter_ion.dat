50|$|Scanning the photon energy {{corresponds}} to shifting the internal energy {{distribution of the}} parent ion. The parent ion sits in a potential energy well, in which the lowest energy exit channel often {{corresponds to}} {{the breaking of the}} weakest chemical bond, resulting in the formation of a fragment or <b>daughter</b> <b>ion.</b> A mass spectrum is recorded at every photon energy, and the fractional ion abundances are plotted to obtain the breakdown diagram. At low energies no parent ion is energetic enough to dissociate, and the parent ion corresponds to 100% of the ion signal. As the photon energy is increased, a certain fraction of the parent ions (in fact according to the cumulative distribution function of the neutral internal energy distribution) still has too little energy to dissociate, but some do. The parent ion fractional abundances decrease, and the <b>daughter</b> <b>ion</b> signal increases. At the dissociative photoionization threshold, E0, all parent ions, even the ones with initially 0 internal energy, can dissociate, and the <b>daughter</b> <b>ion</b> abundance reaches 100% in the breakdown diagram.|$|E

5000|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that the measurements have no serious flaws, as of 2017 of order fifty articles have been published offering and debating various possible theoretical explanations for the oscillating modulations. No consensus has emerged. An example of a proposed explanation relates to the difference in mass of neutrino mass eigenstates, but not through the well-known neutrino flavour oscillations. It is proposed that the quantum state of the <b>daughter</b> <b>ion</b> is [...] "prematurely" [...] disentangled from that of the co-produced neutrino by the ion's motion in its circular orbit guided by the magnetic fields of the storage ring magnets, well before detection of the ion. (Such disentanglement is usually caused by detection of the daughter in experiments not using a storage ring.) A probability amplitude for the ion circulating in the ring for a given time before detection is calculated to depend on the neutrino mass, so that the corresponding probability including all neutrino mass eigenstates would include an interference term involving the neutrino mass difference. The oscillation period estimated in this scheme is within an order of magnitude of that observed.|$|E
