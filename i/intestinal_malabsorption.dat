25|$|Typically, scurvy {{is caused}} by a lack of vitamin C in the diet. It takes at least a month of little to no vitamin C before {{symptoms}} occur. In modern times, it occurs most commonly in people with mental disorders, unusual eating habits, alcoholism, and old people who live alone. Other risk factors include <b>intestinal</b> <b>malabsorption</b> and dialysis. Humans and certain other animals require vitamin C in their diets to make the building blocks for collagen.

25|$|While {{no single}} genetic {{mutation}} {{has been established}} {{as the cause of}} iminoglycinuria; several mutations, affecting transport mechanisms shared by glycine, proline and hydroxyproline, as well as those that selectively transport either glycine or imino acids, including the IMINO system, are known {{to be associated with the}} disorder. When combined, these factors will result in a variable phenotype for iminoglycinuria depending on which mutations are present. However, despite the role that <b>intestinal</b> <b>malabsorption</b> of glycine and imino acids can play in iminoglycinuria, the primary defect disrupts their renal transport and reabsorption. This is evident, as inherited iminoglycinuria can be clinically present with no intestinal involvement.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACF We {{developed}} a test procedure for the clinical evaluation ofthe absorption of vitamin D. Serum vitamin D concentrations were evaluated in seven patients with <b>intestinal</b> fat <b>malabsorption</b> syndromes and in seven healthy, normal subjects, after {{being given a}} single oral dose of 50, 000 IU (1. 25 mg) vitamin D 2. In the normal subjects, serum vitamin D concentrations rose from a baseline ofless than 5 ng/ml to a peak ofover 50 ng/ml by 12 h, gradually falling to baseline levels by 3 days. In {{five of the seven}} patients with <b>intestinal</b> fat <b>malabsorption,</b> oral administration of 50, 000 IU vitamin D did not raise serum vitamin D concentrations above 10 ng/ml. Two patients with severe inflammatory bowel disease had a normal absorption pattern, however. These findings suggest that an oral vitamin D absorption test may be of value for determination of patients at risk for development of vitamin D deficiency. They also raise questions about the efficacy of oral vitamin D preparations in patients with <b>intestinal</b> fat <b>malabsorption.</b> Am J C/in Nutr l 985; 42 : 644 - 649.

40|$|The {{autosomal}} co-dominant disorder familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL) {{may be due}} to {{mutations in}} the APOB gene encoding apolipoprotein B (apoB), the main constituent peptide of chylomicrons, very low and low density lipoproteins. We describe an 11 month-old child with failure to thrive, <b>intestinal</b> lipid <b>malabsorption,</b> hepatic steatosis and severe hypobetalipoproteinemia, suggesting the diagnosis of homozygous FHBL, abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) or chylomicron retention disease (CMRD). The analysis of candidate genes showed that patientwas homozygous for a variant (c. 1594 CNT) in the APOB gene causing arginine to tryptophan conversion at position 505 of mature apoB (Arg 505 Trp). No mutations were found in a panel of other potential candidate genes for hypobetalipoproteinemia. In vitro studies showed a reduced secretion of mutant apoB- 48 with respect to the wild-type apoB- 48 in transfected McA-RH 7777 cells. The Arg 505 Trp substitution is located in the βα 1 domain of apoB involved in the lipidation of apoB mediated by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), the first step in VLDL and chylomicron formation. The patient's condition improved in response to a low fat diet supplemented with fat-soluble vitamins.

50|$|Impaired {{digestion}} or absorption {{can result}} in fatty stools.Possible causes include exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, with poor digestion from lack of lipases, loss of bile salts, which reduces micelle formation, and small <b>intestinal</b> disease producing <b>malabsorption.</b> Various other causes include certain medicines that block fat absorption, or indigestible or excess oil/fat in diet.|$|R
50|$|Two fatty acids, {{linoleic}} acid and alpha-linolenic acid, are considered {{essential fatty acids}} (EFAs) in humans and other mammals. Both are 18 carbon fatty acids unlike mead acid, which has 20 carbons. Linoleic is an ω-6 fatty acid whereas linolenic is ω-3 and mead is ω-9. One study examined patients with <b>intestinal</b> fat <b>malabsorption</b> and suspected EFA deficiency; they {{were found to have}} blood-levels of Mead acid 1263% higher than reference subjects. Under severe conditions of essential fatty acid deprivation, mammals will elongate and desaturate oleic acid to make mead acid, (20:3, n−9). This has been documented to a lesser extent in vegetarians and semi-vegetarians following an unbalanced diet.|$|R
50|$|To {{maintain}} {{blood levels}} of calcium, therapeutic vitamin D doses are sometimes administered (up to 100,000 IU or 2.5 mg daily) to patients who have had their parathyroid glands removed (most commonly kidney dialysis patients who have had tertiary hyperparathyroidism, but also to patients with primary hyperparathyroidism) or with hypoparathyroidism. Patients with chronic liver disease or <b>intestinal</b> <b>malabsorption</b> disorders may also require larger doses of vitamin D (up to 40,000 IU or 1 mg (1000 micrograms) daily).|$|E
50|$|If {{there is}} {{impairment}} {{of any of}} the many steps involved in the complex process of nutrient digestion and absorption, <b>intestinal</b> <b>malabsorption</b> may ensue. If the abnormality involves a single step in the absorptive process, as in primary lactase deficiency, or if the disease process is limited to the very proximal small intestine selective malabsorption of only a single nutrient may occur. However, generalized malabsorption of multiple dietary nutrients develops when the disease process is extensive, thus disturbing several digestive and absorptive processes, as occurs in coeliac disease with extensive involvement of the small intestine.|$|E

In osteomalacia, the administration of calcitriol resulted in a dramatic improvement in bone mineral density (sometimes up to 50 % in 12 months), indicating the rapid mineralization of previously uncalcified bone tissue {{as a result of}} the normalization of the Ca x P product. In osteoporosis a similar treatment was seen to halt the progressive decrease in bone mineral levels and sometimes resulted in minor increases in density (up to 5 %).

50|$|The {{overgrowth}} {{of bacteria}} in the small intestine is prevented by various mechanical and chemical factors which include the constant peristaltic movement of contents {{along the length of}} the gastrointestinal tract and the antibacterial properties of gastric secretions, pancreatic secretions and bile.It follows that a disruption of any of these factors could lead to bacterial overgrowth and indeed BLS has been found to occur in persons with anatomical anomalies that result in stagnation. BLS has also been associated with achlorhydria, dysmotility, fistulae, and strictures.Due to the disruption of digestive processes by the overgrowth of <b>intestinal</b> bacteria <b>malabsorption</b> of bile salts, fat and fat-soluble vitamins, protein and carbohydrates results in damage to the mucosal lining of the intestine by bacteria or via the production of toxic metabolites.|$|R
50|$|Other {{conditions}} that increase risk include {{the sharing of}} needles among IV drug users, recent TB infection or a history of inadequately treated TB, chest X-ray suggestive of previous TB, showing fibrotic lesions and nodules, prolonged corticosteroid therapy and other immunosuppressive therapy, compromised immune system (30-40% of people with AIDS worldwide also have TB), hematologic and reticuloendothelial diseases, such as leukemia and Hodgkin's disease, end-stage kidney disease, <b>intestinal</b> bypass, chronic <b>malabsorption</b> syndromes, vitamin D deficiency, and low body weight.|$|R

50|$|Depending on {{the nature}} of the disease process causing {{malabsorption}} and its extent, gastrointestinal symptoms may range from severe to subtle or may even be totally absent. Diarrhea, weight loss, flatulence, abdominal bloating, abdominal cramps, and pain may be present. Although diarrhea is a common complaint, the character and frequency of stools may vary considerably ranging from over 10 watery stools per day to less than one voluminous putty-like stool, the latter causing some patients to complain of constipation. On the other hand, stool mass is invariably increased in patients with steatorrhea and generalized malabsorption above the normal with 150-200 g/day. Not only do unabsorbed nutrients contribute to stool mass but mucosal fluid and electrolyte secretion is also increased in diseases associated with mucosal inflammation such as coeliac disease. In addition, unabsorbed fatty acids, converted to hydroxy-fatty acids by colonic flora, as well as unabsorbed bile acids both impair absorption and induce secretion of water and electrolytes by the colon adding to stool mass. Weight loss is common among patients with significant <b>intestinal</b> <b>malabsorption</b> but must be evaluated in the context of caloric intake. Some patients compensate for fecal wastage of unabsorbed nutrients by significantly increasing their oral intake. Eliciting a careful dietary history from patients with suspected malabsorption is therefore crucial. Excessive flatus and abdominal bloating may reflect excessive gas production due to fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrate, especially among patients with primary or secondary disaccharidase deficiency. Malabsorption of dietary nutrients and excessive fluid secretion by inflamed small intestine also contribute to abdominal distention and bloating. Prevalence, severity, and character of abdominal pain vary considerably among the various disease processes associated with <b>intestinal</b> <b>malabsorption.</b> For example, pain is common in patients with chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer and Crohn disease, but it is absent in many patients with coeliac disease or postgastrectomy malabsorption.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Primary hypobetalipoproteinemia (HBL) {{includes}} {{a group of}} genetic disorders: abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) and chylomicron retention disease (CRD), with a recessive transmission, and familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL) with a co-dominant transmission. ABL and CRD are rare disorders due to mutations in the MTP and SARA 2 genes, respectively. Heterozygous FHBL is much more frequent. FHBL subjects often have fatty liver and, less frequently, <b>intestinal</b> fat <b>malabsorption.</b> FHBL may be linked or not to the APOB gene. Most mutations in APOB gene cause the formation of truncated forms of apoB {{which may or may}} be not secreted into the plasma. Truncated apoBs with a size below that of apoB- 30 are not detectable in plasma; they are more frequent in patients with the most severe phenotype.

40|$|Three {{patients}} are described, and they provide {{further evidence that}} deficiency of folic acid and vitamin B 12 may sometimes affect small <b>intestinal</b> function. <b>Malabsorption</b> of both xylose and vitamin B 12 returned to normal in one patient after treatment of a megaloblastic anaemia due to dietary deficiency of folic acid. Impaired absorption of vitamin B 12 was corrected by vitamin B 12 therapy {{in the other two}} patients. The initial cause of the vitamin B 12 deficiency in one patient was not apparent, but she was taking Gynovlar 21, which may have been an aetiological factor. In the third patient the small intestinal defect was secondary to pernicious anaemia, and in a group of 98 other patients with pernicious anaemia intrinsic factor did not improve vitamin B 12 absorption in six, and only partially corrected absorption in 30. The significance of these observations is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Aerophagia is a {{functional}} gastrointestinal disorder characterized by repetitive air swallowing, abdominal distension, belching and flatulence. Pathologic aerophagia {{is a condition}} caused by the swallowing of excessive volumes of air with associated various gastrointestinal symptoms, such as burping, abdominal cramps, flatulence and a reduced appetite. It is a clinical entity that can simulate pediatric gastrointestinal motility disorders, such as gastroparesis, megacolon and intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and presents more frequently in children with mental retardation. Early recognition and diagnosis of functional aerophagia or pathologic aerophagia is required to avoid unnecessary, expensive diagnostic investigations or serious clinical complications. Functional aerophagia is frequent in the adult population, but rarely discussed in the pediatric literature. We present two pediatric clinical cases {{with a history of}} functional constipation in whom gaseous abdominal distension was the most important symptom. Mechanical intestinal obstruction, chronic <b>intestinal</b> pseudo-obstruction, <b>malabsorption</b> and congenital aganglionic megacolon were ruled out. Extensive gaseous abdominal distension was due to aerophagia, and treatment consisted of parents' reassurance and psychological counseling...|$|R
50|$|In humans, enteropeptidase is encoded by the PRSS7 gene (also {{known as}} ENTK) on {{chromosome}} 21q21. Some nonsense and frameshift mutations in this gene {{lead to a}} rare recessive disorder characterised by severe failure to thrive in affected infants, due to enteropeptidase deficiency. Enteropeptidase mRNA expression {{is limited to the}} proximal small intestine, and the protein is found in enterocytes of duodenum and proximal jejunum. Upon secretion from the pancreas into the duodenum, trypsinogen encounters enteropeptidase and is activated. Trypsin then cleaves and activates other pancreatic serine protease zymogens (chymotrypsinogen and proelastases), metalloprotease zymogens (procarboxypeptidases) and prolipases. By means of this simple two-step cascade, the destructive activity of these digestive hydrolases is confined to the lumen of the intestine. The physiological importance of this pathway is demonstrated by the severe <b>intestinal</b> <b>malabsorption</b> caused by congenital deficiency of enteropeptidase. This condition can be life-threatening, but responds to oral supplementation with pancreatic extract.|$|E
50|$|A D-Xylose {{test can}} be performed, {{which is where}} the patient will consume 4.5g of D-xylose, a sugar, by mouth. The urine {{excretion}} of D-Xylose is then measured after 5 hours. The majority of D-Xylose is absorbed normally, and should be found in the urine. If the D-Xylose is found to be low in the urine, this suggests an <b>intestinal</b> <b>malabsorption</b> problem such as bacterial overgrowth of the proximal small intestine, Whipple's Disease, or an autoimmune with diseases such as Celiac's Disease (allergy to gluten) or Crohn's Disease (autoimmune disease affecting the small intestine). With empiric antibiotic treatment after an initial positive D-Xylose test, and if a follow-up D-Xylose test is positive (decreased urine excretion) after antibiotic therapy, then this would signify it is not bacterial overgrowth of the proximal small intestine. Since Whipple's disease is so rare, a follow-up positive D-Xylose test more likely indicates a non-infectious etiology and more likely an autoimmune etiology. Clinical correlation is recommended to rule out Whipple's disease.|$|E
50|$|Glycine, proline and {{hydroxyproline}} {{share common}} renal tubular mechanisms of reabsorption, a function {{specific to the}} proximal tubule. Both reabsorption or absorption of glycine and imino acids takes place respectively at the proximal tubule or intestinal brush border epithelium. The more selective transport of proline and other imino acids is driven {{at the molecular level}} by a mammalian cellular transport mechanism aptly known as system IMINO.While no single genetic mutation has been established as the cause of iminoglycinuria; several mutations, affecting transport mechanisms shared by glycine, proline and hydroxyproline, as well as those that selectively transport either glycine or imino acids, including the IMINO system, are known {{to be associated with the}} disorder. When combined, these factors will result in a variable phenotype for iminoglycinuria depending on which mutations are present. However, despite the role that <b>intestinal</b> <b>malabsorption</b> of glycine and imino acids can play in iminoglycinuria, the primary defect disrupts their renal transport and reabsorption.

40|$|Hereditary folate {{malabsorption}} (HFM) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} disorder which is characterized by impaired <b>intestinal</b> folate <b>malabsorption</b> and impaired folate transport into the central nervous system. Mutations in the intestinal folate transporter PCFT have been reported previously in only 10 individuals with this disorder. The {{purpose of the current}} study was to describe the clinical phenotype and determine the molecular basis for this disorder in a family with four affected individuals. A consanguineous family of Pakistani origin with autosomal recessive HFM was ascertained and clinically phenotyped. After genetic linkage studies all coding exons of the PCFT gene were screened for mutations by direct sequencing. The clinical phenotype of four affected patients is described. Direct sequencing of PCFT revealed a novel homozygous frameshift mutation (c. 194 dupG) at a mononucleotide repeat in exon 1 predicted to result in a truncated protein (p. Cys 66 LeufsX 99).

40|$|In young infants the {{clinical}} and investigative features of coeliac disease (CD) may be mimicked by other {{conditions such as}} cow's milk intolerance or secondary disaccharidase deficiency. It is therefore especially important to confirm a diagnosis of CD by later gluten challenge in such infants. Sixteen children in whom the diagnosis of CD had been made {{before the age of}} 12 months had an oral gluten challenge, after being treated with a gluten-free diet for periods of one month to 5 years. In 15 we showed <b>intestinal</b> xylose <b>malabsorption</b> by the one-hour blood xylose level within 1 - 28 days of starting ingestion of gluten. One child, with a persistently normal one-hour blood xylose test after gluten challenge for 3 months, had normal absorption and normal jejunal histology after 18 months on a gluten-containing diet; she is considered not to have CD. The one-hour blood xylose test before and after gluten challenge can help to confirm the diagnosis in coeliac patients diagnosed in infancy...|$|R
40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) {{represents the}} most common lethal autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population. It is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, resulting in abnormal Na+ and Cl− transport in several tissues. Its main clinical manifestations include bronchopulmonary infections along with gastrointestinal and nutritional disorders. Intense and recurrent inflammation ultimately leads to an overabundance of activated neutrophils and macrophages that contribute to free radical generation. Furthermore, CFTR defects directly affect glutathione transport and homeostasis, while <b>intestinal</b> fat <b>malabsorption</b> limits uptake of endogenous antioxidant vitamins. Collectively, these abnormal events disturb the balance between pro- and anti-oxidants and promote oxidative stress, which may {{play a significant role}} in CF-related diabetes (CFRD), a severe complication associated with a drastic increase of morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the involvement of oxidative stress in CF pathology, especially its role in the occurrence of CFRD.
