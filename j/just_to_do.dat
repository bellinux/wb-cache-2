2500|$|Although Knievel never {{attempted}} to jump the Grand Canyon, rumors of the Canyon jump were started by Knievel himself in 1968, following the Caesars Palace crash. [...] During a 1968 interview, Knievel stated, [...] "I don't {{care if they}} say, 'Look, kid, you're going to drive that thing {{off the edge of}} the Canyon and die,' I'm going to do it. I want to be the first. If they'd let me go to the moon, I'd crawl all the way to Cape Kennedy <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. I'd like to go to the moon, but I don't want to be the second man to go there." [...] For the next several years, Knievel negotiated with the federal government to secure a jumping site and develop various concept bikes to make the jump, but the Interior Department denied him airspace over the northern Arizona canyon. Knievel switched his attention in 1971 to the Snake River Canyon in southern Idaho.|$|E
2500|$|On May 26, 2007, he and Johnny Obsession lost to Mauler and Barry Goode at the Wrestling’s Hero’s and Villains supercard in Cloverdale, British Columbia. Afterwards, he {{and several}} other wrestlers, {{including}} Monster Pro Wrestling's Heavy Metal, spent several hours at the Citrus bar. On September 15, 2007, Jessome participated in a special fundraiser for the Special Olympics in Comox, British Columbia. At the event, he lost to Disco Fury but later {{went on to win}} the main event, a 15-man battle royal, to be awarded the Taco Del Mar-sponsored [...] "Carlos Cup". On September 25, he defended the ECPW Heavyweight Championship in a triple threat match against Bobby Roode and [...] "Kowboy" [...] Mike Hughes. Former World Wrestling Federation veteran Tito Santana also made an appearance at the event. Both Santana and himself were quoted by the Cape Breton Post voicing their criticism towards steroid abuse in professional wrestling. Jessome said [...] "I've got size and technical abilities, plus I love to entertain a crowd, so I think that's enough for me. To put your health at risk <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something like that, that's not acceptable." [...] After a two-year reign, he finally lost the ECPW Heavyweight Championship to Mike Hughes in North Sydney on September 30, 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Author Michael Zager {{wrote that}} Pet Sounds resembles Spector's {{productions}} {{more than it}} does Rubber Soul, and that it recycles many of Spector's Wall of Sound production watermarks. Wilson talked of Spector's influence on his work, having learned how to produce records through attending his sessions, and in a 1988 interview, Wilson asserted that the album aspired to [...] "extend" [...] Spector's music, that [...] "in one sense of the word, we [...] were his messengers." [...] In Pet Sounds, Wilson sought to emulate Spector's Wall of Sound, driven by his fascination with [...] "combining one [...] to make another... It's amazing". Shortly before the album's release, Wilson spoke of recent popular music trends, saying [...] " [...] helped the Beach Boys evolve. We listen to what's happening and it affects what we do too. The trends have influenced my work, but so has my own scene." [...] In 1996, Wilson said of his partnership with Asher: [...] "none of us looked back... We went forward, kind of like on our own little wavelength. It wasn't like we were thinking, 'Okay, let's beat Spector,' let's out-do Motown.' It was more what I would call exclusive collaboration not to specifically try to kick somebody's butt, but <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{it the way you}} really want it to be. That's what I thought we did." ...|$|E

6000|$|Pete nodded. [...] "I ken! When ye feel ye must do a thing, it's better <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it {{and think}} afterwards." [...] Then {{he raised his}} hand. [...] "She's stopping!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you think}} you've {{got the better}} of me, do you? You think you've carried me along with you, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> your bidding and take {{whatever}} you please to give me? That's your idea of me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh?" [...] replied Peter, [...] "you {{must mean}} {{the voice of}} my friend. Old Man Coyote. He came up here last night <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> me a good turn because I once did him a good turn." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You'll soon {{get used}} to it," [...] Joan told her. [...] "The great thing {{is not to be}} afraid of one's fate, {{whatever}} it is; but <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> one's best." [...] It was rather like talking to a child.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why then isn't {{it in her}} own interest, for {{the sake}} of the screen, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that? The {{appearance}} of someone in particular would be exactly the opposite of the appearance of Long. Your own admission is that that's his line with Lady John." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{fill your}} pockets," [...] said Crocker, [...] "is n't the main thing. One has <b>just</b> got <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things without {{thinking}} {{of why we}} do them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are short}} of crockery," [...] {{the man said}} with a laugh. [...] "Here are some knives, but as for forks, we <b>just</b> have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> without them." ...|$|R

6000|$|What a pity it is {{that modern}} diplomatists, who, for the most part, very {{carefully}} observe the precept contained {{in the last two}} lines of this passage, should not equally bear in mind the importance of the preceding remark--that their principal business is <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> no mischief.--ED.] ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{then took}} leave of the fortune-teller. But, seriously, is it well to glorify a murderous villain on the scaffold, as Pike was glorified in New Hampshire? Is it well {{to turn the}} penalty for a bloody crime into a reward? Is it <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it? Is it safe? ...|$|E

5000|$|... "My {{recollection}} is that Rick Nielsen {{did that}} song {{as a bit}} of a joke, because at the time when we had done that song {{there was a lot of}} pop music on the radio—ABBA, and all sorts of things, disco, thought 'I'm <b>just</b> going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> an over-the-top pop song. I <b>just</b> want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> one that's so silly—total pop—and then we'll do a heavy version of it.' He didn't know what was going to happen with it. The idea was to have it like a heavy metal pop song. Cheap Trick doing ABBA—except a very heavy version." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems very}} odd, very sad," [...] Margaret returned, [...] "that you never could act unselfishly in society affairs. If I wished {{to go and}} see those girls <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> them a pleasure, and perhaps because if they're strange and lonely, I might do them good, even--it would be impossible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Her marrying--some one or other? It's <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{away with}} {{anything}} of that sort that I make my suggestion. If she has an easy income she'll never have to marry for a support. That's what I want cannily to prevent. She wishes to be free, and your bequest will make her free." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Making up my mind, you mean? I don't know, but Jo {{has given}} me a splendid rule.

6000|$|It was {{inevitable}} that the girl should soon refer to the ranger, and Redfield was as complimentary of him as she could wish.

He's content <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{the duty of the}} moment. He made a good cow-puncher and a good soldier; but as for promotion, he laughs when I mention it." ...|$|E
