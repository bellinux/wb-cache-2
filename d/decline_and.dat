5|$|A {{critical}} {{issue is how}} to design protected areas for amphibians which will provide suitable conditions for their survival. Conservation efforts {{through the use of}} protected areas have shown to generally be a temporary solution to population <b>decline</b> <b>and</b> extinction because the amphibians become inbred. It is crucial for most amphibians to maintain a high level of genetic variation through large and more diverse environments.|$|E

5|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, the economy went into <b>decline</b> <b>and</b> the population quickly started to decrease. Between 1989 and 2002, Murmansk Oblast lost almost a quarter of its population; and almost 100,000 more between 2002 and 2010. Nevertheless, the economy rebounded somewhat {{in the first decade of}} the 2000s and the peninsula remains the most industrially developed and urbanized region in northern Russia.|$|E

5|$|Competition {{from new}} superpredators, such as macropredatory sperm whales which {{appeared}} in the Miocene, and killer whales and great white sharks in the Pliocene, may have also contributed to the <b>decline</b> <b>and</b> extinction of megalodon. Fossil records indicate that the new whale-eating cetaceans commonly occurred at high latitudes during the Pliocene, indicating that they could cope with the increasingly prevalent cold water temperatures; but they also occurred in the tropics (e.g., Orcinus sp. in South Africa).|$|E
5|$|Great white {{pelicans}} {{range over}} a large area of Africa and southern Asia. The overall trend in numbers is uncertain, {{with a mix of}} regional populations that are increasing, declining, stable or unknown, but {{there is no evidence of}} rapid overall <b>decline</b> <b>and</b> the status of the species is assessed as being of Least Concern. Threats include the drainage of wetlands, persecution and sport hunting, disturbance at the breeding colonies, and contamination by pesticides and heavy metals.|$|E
5|$|LTP has {{received}} much attention {{among those who}} study Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease that causes marked cognitive <b>decline</b> <b>and</b> dementia.

5|$|Of 19 {{species of}} native nestmaking {{bumblebees}} and six species of cuckoo bumblebees formerly widespread in Britain, three have been extirpated, eight are in serious <b>decline,</b> <b>and</b> only six remain widespread. Similar declines {{have been reported}} in Ireland, with four species designated endangered, and another two considered vulnerable to extinction. A decline in bumblebee numbers could cause large-scale changes to the countryside, resulting from inadequate pollination of certain plants.|$|E
5|$|Other related {{studies have}} also shown {{evidence}} of synaptic alterations and their loss, in the ageing brain. Changes in gene expression alter the levels of proteins in various pathways {{and this has been}} shown to be evident in synaptic contact dysfunction or loss. This dysfunction has been seen to affect many structures of the brain and has a marked effect on inhibitory neurons resulting in a decreased level of neurotransmission, and subsequent cognitive <b>decline</b> <b>and</b> disease.|$|E

As Parkinson's is not a curable disease, all treatments are focused on slowing <b>decline</b> <b>and</b> improving quality of life, and are therefore palliative in nature.|$|E
