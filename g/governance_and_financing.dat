UNESCO has designated Komodo as both a World Heritage Site and a Man and Biosphere reserve. [...] The Nature Conservancy has provided local law enforcement with training, boats, and radios, and jointly operates the park's eco-tourism concession with Jaythasha Putrindo. [...] The World Bank has supported the site as an Integrated Conservation and Development Project.|$|E
50|$|Inefficient use of resources- The {{concern that}} is usually raised {{here is that the}} system as a whole seems to have {{significant}} (even if insufficient) resources, but the duplication and lack of coordination within the system can mean that resources are not always used most efficiently. In 2000, for example, the World Bank had an active portfolio of over US$5 billion in environmental projects, the UNDP’s portfolio was over US$1.2 billion in the same year, and the GEF has funded over US$4.5 billion of projects since its inception. National governments, civil society and the private sector in aggregate also expend significant financial resources on environmental projects. In spite of this impressive pool of money, particular elements of the system remain chronically under-funded. Geographic fragmentation and duplication of activities can result in higher operational costs and inefficient use of resources. With greater coherence in the system of <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> <b>financing,</b> a great deal more could be achieved with the existing resources.|$|E

40|$|Corporate {{governance}} {{has become}} a major policy concern {{in the wake of the}} Asian financial crisis. Weak governance structure, poor investment, <b>and</b> risky <b>financing</b> practices of the corporate sector in the affected countries contributed to their sharp economic recession in 1997 - 1998. The weaknesses in corporate <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> <b>finance</b> undermined the capacity of these countries to withstand the combined shocks of depreciated currencies, mass capital outflows, increased rates, and large contraction in domestic demand. To help understand the corporate <b>governance</b> issues <b>and</b> their impact, as well as to identify needs for interventions in addressing policy and institutional weaknesses, the Economics and Development Resource Center of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) undertook a regional study on corporate <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> <b>finance</b> in selected developing member countries.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{development}} and significance of the European Institute of Technology (EIT) in the period since 2005 when the European Union launched a suite of initiatives for higher education, research and innovation, including the EIT, {{as part of a}}ttempts to re-launch its Lisbon Strategy around a ‘growth and jobs’ agenda. The EIT is presented as implicated in European Commission attempts to redefine the mandates and governance of higher education institutions as part of a knowledge-based economy route to economic and social development. The production and contestation of the EIT as it was negotiated within EU institutions is shown as having been conditioned by the interactions between Commission attempts to use the EIT to disrupt the <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> <b>financing</b> of higher education and research and national and institutional determination to constrain the EIT within extant <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> <b>financing</b> principles. In conclusion, the paper outlines a research agenda for the study and analysis of the EIT in the period up to 2013 which will make it possible to specify the significance of the EIT for EU integration, the development of the European higher education, research and innovation fields, the fate of EU strategies for capital accumulation and social development and the legitimacy of the EU itself...|$|E

40|$|The law {{and finance}} {{literature}} highlights {{the role of}} investor rights in financial development, firm corporate <b>governance,</b> <b>and</b> <b>financing</b> patterns. For a panel of 35 countries, we investigate how bankruptcy use relates to countries' creditor rights and judicial efficiency. Bankruptcies are higher in countries with more creditor rights, except for a "no automatic stay on assets" provision. Higher judicial efficiency is associated with more bankruptcies and appears as a substitute with more creditor rights. Although only a first step, our findings suggest creditor rights are complex, balancing prioritization of claims, ex ante risk-taking incentives, and an efficient resolution of distressed firms.

40|$|States are {{pursuing}} service integration that differs substantively and strategically {{from the first}} wave of service integration in the 1970 s. This article describes the new approach, using Maryland's Systems Reform Initiative as an example, and identifies the ways in which it differs from the original wave. The most important substantive difference is that, in contrast to the first wave, which emphasized administrative reforms, these new state initiatives include casework, <b>governance,</b> <b>and</b> <b>financing</b> reforms as well. There are also differences in strategy. The early wave favored top-down initiatives, combined with limited bottom-up activities such as pilot projects. The new wave, contrary to previous efforts, uses a "bootstrapping" approach, in which reform proceeds incrementally, local participants learn by doing, and the state learns by monitoring...|$|E
40|$|The United Nations {{opened the}} first ever World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in Geneva, Switzerland, in December 2003. Per the mandate given to hold WSIS by the ITU in 1998, the event was {{supposed}} to focus on using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for development (ICT 4 D, or "E-Development"). However in this broad field there were many other players besides the ITU and its UN partners, and it proved difficult to induce those existing authorities to cede power to the new venue. The event is scheduled to continue in Tunis in 2005. Negotiations are the usual form that actors choose for progress on goal to be achieved multilaterally. However WSIS is not a venue for negotiations, but rather a showcase and networking space. This paper strives to apply regime theory and institutional economics to the conflicts that arise when existing regimes are challenged by the ITU and its WSIS partners (including UNESCO and the UN ICT Task Force). The paper presents the interests of four of the other main institutions involved, which more closely reflect those of the United States: the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Group of Eight major industrialized nations (G- 8). WSIS Geneva produced a mandate to UN SG Kofi Annan to set up groups to continue working {{on the issues of}} Internet <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> <b>financing,</b> and to report its results to WSIS Tunis. Answers to issues other than Internet <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> <b>financing</b> will have to be sought elsewhere.

40|$|With an {{introduction}} to the overall underdevelopment of higher education in China compared with the American counterpart, this article briefly examines the main trends of over two decades of development of the <b>governance</b> <b>and</b> <b>financing</b> systems of China's higher education sector. This article analyzes the resource allocation from governments and revenue generation in institutions under the reform policies of administrative decentralization and financing diversification. The new "Great Leap Forward" in higher education in 1999 and beyond, i. e., the radical and, to a certain extent, desperate mass higher education policy and practice of expanding enrollments in order to spur domestic consumption, is critically analyzed. By examining the ongoing institutional merging and "co-building" and the most recent enrollment expansion, the writer points out the economic significance for higher education of overcoming diseconomies of scale and inefficiencies. However, the long-range outcomes of the seemingly exciting investment in and consumption of mass higher education are difficult to predict...|$|E
