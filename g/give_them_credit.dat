25|$|On several {{occasions}} the Riglers maintained that their home {{had been the}} best available option for Genie at the time, and said that both they and everyone who worked with her thought she was doing well. They also said they genuinely loved Genie and always provided her the best care possible, pointing out {{that she had made}} substantial progress in every aspect of her development while living with them, and they and Curtiss both said Genie's mother had prevented them from continuing to work with Genie as they had wanted. While representing the Riglers in court in 1977 and 1978 John Miner {{went out of his way}} to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>credit</b> for acting as foster parents to Genie for four years, and when Curtiss spoke to Rymer in the early 1990s she praised their work with Genie and their willingness to take her into their home, although she also felt they had not done enough when she told them about Genie's abuse in foster care. Justin Leiber argued that the scientists' inability to do more for Genie was largely out of their control, and primarily the result of legal and institutional processes surrounding her placement.|$|E
500|$|In its 7 December 2010 issue, Heat {{magazine}} said series 7 of The X Factor {{had been}} the best series to date, citing many of the controversies, plus events such as Lloyd singing on a spiral staircase, Wagner's [...] "ludicrous" [...] performances and Walsh likening Richardson to [...] "a little Lenny Henry", as moments that helped make it [...] "the most deliriously, thrilling, controversial and demented yet. [...] This was the year the biggest and best show on TV somehow got bigger and better." [...] Before the final, Digital Spy's reality television editor Alex Fletcher listed his five favourite moments from the series. His favourite moment was Nhengu's elimination, on which he said [...] "No other show can make people so passionate, angry and feel like they really know the programme's stars. With only approximately 30 minutes of screentime, Gamu had managed to capture the hearts of millions. Whatever you think of Simon Cowell's programmes, you have to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>credit</b> for achieving that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't think you're quite fair on the Militia," [...] drawled Verschoyle. [...] "They're {{better than}} we <b>give</b> <b>'em</b> <b>credit</b> for. Don't you {{remember}} the Middle Moor Collieries' strike?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "We {{always look}} to play {{aggressive}} cricket. It's {{part of our}} batting philosophy, we try to score off as many balls as possible. That's how we have been successful. But some of the shot selection from our top six batsmen was not good enough today. The Indian bowlers bowled in the right areas, <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>credit</b> for that. But our batting performance was immature." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his next}} column, Sheldrake again {{attacked}} Rose for following [...] "materialism", {{and argued that}} quantum physics had [...] "overturned" [...] materialism, and suggested that [...] "memories {{may turn out to}} depend on morphic resonance rather than memory traces". [...] Philosopher Alan Malachowski of the University of East Anglia, responding to what he called Sheldrake's [...] "latest muddled diatribe", defended materialism, argued that Sheldrake dismissed Rose's explanation with an [...] "absurd rhetorical comparison", asserted that quantum physics was compatible with materialism and argued that [...] "being roughly right about great many things has given [...] the confidence to be far more open minded than he is prepared to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>credit</b> for".|$|E
2500|$|Other than Taylor, however, {{several other}} critics also {{disagree}} with Warren's {{assessment of the}} quality of the language, arguing that the passages are more complex and accomplished than has hitherto been allowed for. Michael Taylor, for example, argues that [...] "the rhyming dialogue between the Talbots – often stichomythic – shapes a kind of noble flyting match, a competition as to who can out-oblige the other." [...] Similarly, Alexander Leggatt argues that the passages are a perfect blend of form and content: [...] "The relentless click-click of the rhymes reinforces the point that for John Talbot, all arguments are arguments for death; as every other line ending is countered by a rhyme, so every argument Talbot gives John to flee becomes an argument for staying." [...] Taylor and Leggatt are here arguing that the passages are more accomplished than most critics tend to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>credit</b> for, thus offering a counter-argument to the theory that they are so poorly written, they could not possibly be by Shakespeare. In this sense, his failure to use couplets elsewhere in a tragic passage can thus be attributed to an aesthetic choice on his part, rather than offered as evidence of co-authorship.|$|E

60|$|The {{world in}} general is under a mistake as {{to the nature of}} these vermin. They are by no means characterised by that {{similarity}} of disposition for which your common observer <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> <b>credit.</b> There are Toadeys of all possible natures.|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't be foolish," [...] I exclaimed. [...] "They're used to it. They think {{themselves}} {{lucky to}} get the work--and they are. Besides, you <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>credit</b> for a sensitiveness that they don't possess. They wouldn't {{know what to do}} with such a house as this if they had it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{think we}} can risk that," [...] Reuben replied.

6000|$|... "Nobody," [...] said Jim. [...] "Except two Siwash, {{there was}} nobody in the settlement; and, anyway, the store was most empty when the boys came along."

60|$|He did not {{fish for}} gulls that day. Bududreen and Muda Saffir stood talking upon the beach, and the Chinaman {{did not dare}} venture forth for fear they might suspect that he had overheard them.

"It is clear," [...] the French {{officer said}} to those {{standing}} around him, [...] "that {{they came in}} to reconnoitre the landing place, and thought, in the dim light, they could run the gauntlet of our sentries' fire.

5000|$|The album [...] "The Youth Die Young" [...] has {{received}} widespread coverage, with generally positive reviews, giving {{credit to the}} group for maturing beyond their concert-oriented roots.

25|$|Activision {{was popular}} among {{developers}} for <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> <b>credit</b> in the packaging and title screens for their games, while Atari disallowed this practice. As {{the video game}} industry took off in the mid-1980s, many developers faced the more distressing problem of working with fly-by-night or unscrupulous publishers that would either fold unexpectedly or run off with the game profits.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{how long}} could we hold out?" [...] Simon said, {{with a hard}} laugh. [...] "Is there a day's food left, in the city? If there is, my men are less sharp than I <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>credit</b> for. No, we will fight here, to the end, for the Temple; and the sooner the Romans attack, the better, for if they delay many days, {{there is not a}} single man will have {{strength}} enough to lift a sword." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Those {{who make}} that kind of talk are only shiftless people with never a dollar of their own, {{consequently}} they don't know the value of one," [...] the old man cried, angrily. [...] "It's all very well for a set of loafers who are mad with me because I wouldn't <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>credit</b> to say such things.

6000|$|... "The fat {{will be in}} {{the fire}} with a vengeance now," [...] he said, [...] "I didn't <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>credit</b> for having so much sense.

Cut down the Green Mountain bluff, smoke out beast and bird, plant a workman's colony down in Carrington! Turn the ideal Utopia into a common, ordinary creamery!--and you will notice they mean to make it pay. The sun would stand still sooner than the Colonel consent." ...|$|E
