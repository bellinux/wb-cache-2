5000|$|The natural unit of {{information}} (symbol: nat), sometimes also nit [...] or nepit, is a unit {{of information}} or entropy, based on natural logarithms and powers of e, rather than the powers of 2 and base 2 logarithms, which define the bit. This unit is also known by its unit symbol, the nat. The nat is the natural unit for information entropy. The International System of Units, by assigning the same units (<b>joule</b> <b>per</b> <b>kelvin)</b> both to heat capacity and to thermodynamic entropy implicitly treats information entropy as a quantity of dimension one, with 1 nat = 1. Physical systems of natural units that normalize Boltzmann's constant to 1 are effectively measuring thermodynamic entropy in nats.|$|E
5000|$|The formal {{thermodynamic}} {{criterion of}} a given monomer polymerizability is related to {{a sign of the}} free enthalpy (Gibbs free energy) of polymerization:where x and y indicate monomer and polymer states, respectively (x and/or y = l (liquid), g (gaseous), c (amorphous solid), c’ (crystalline solid), s (solution)), ΔHp(xy) and ΔSp(xy) are the corresponding enthalpy (SI unit: <b>joule</b> <b>per</b> <b>kelvin)</b> and entropy (SI unit: joule) of polymerization, and T is the absolute temperature (SI unit: kelvin).The free enthalpy of polymerization (ΔGp) may be expressed as a sum of standard enthalpy of polymerization (ΔGp°) and a term related to instantaneous monomer molecules and growing macromolecules concentrations: where R is the gas constant, M is the monomer, (m)i is the monomer in an initial state, and m* is the active monomer.Following Flory-Huggins solution theory that the reactivity of an active center, located at a macromolecule of a sufficiently long macromolecular chain, does not depend on its degree of polymerization (DPi), and taking in to account that ΔGp° = ΔHp° - TΔSp° (where ΔHp° and ΔSp° indicate a standard polymerization enthalpy and entropy, respectively), we obtain: At equilibrium (ΔGp = 0), when polymerization is complete the monomer concentration (Meq) assumes a value determined by standard polymerization parameters (ΔHp° and ΔSp°) and polymerization temperature:Polymerzation is possible only when M0 > Meq. Eventually, at or above the so-called ceiling temperature (Tc), at which Meq = M0, formation of the high polymer does not occur. For example, tetrahydrofuran (THF) cannot be polymerized above Tc = 84 °C, nor cyclo-octasulfur (S8) below Tf = 159 °C. [...] However, for many monomers, Tc and Tf, for polymerization in the bulk, are well above or below the operable polymerization temperatures, respectively.The polymerization of a majority of monomers is accompanied by an entropy decrease, due mostly to the loss in the translational degrees of freedom. In this situation, polymerization is thermodynamically allowed only when the enthalpic contribution into ΔGp prevails (thus, when ΔHp° < 0 and ΔSp° < 0, the inequality |ΔHp| > -TΔSp is required). Therefore, the higher the ring strain, the lower the resulting monomer concentration at equilibrium.|$|E

50|$|In modern terms, Dulong and Petit {{found that}} the heat {{capacity}} of a mole of many solid elements is about 3R, where R is the modern constant called the universal gas constant.

[...] In magnitude, a nat is apparently identical to Boltzmann's constant k or the ideal gas constant R, although these particular quantities are usually reserved to measure physical information {{that happens to be}} entropy, and that are expressed in physical units such as <b>joules</b> <b>per</b> <b>kelvin,</b> or kilocalories <b>per</b> mole-kelvin.|$|R

25|$|Unlike {{many other}} {{functions}} of state, entropy cannot be directly observed {{but must be}} calculated. Entropy can be calculated for a substance as the standard molar entropy from absolute zero (also known as absolute entropy) or as a difference in entropy from some other reference state which is defined as zero entropy. Entropy has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, which has a unit of <b>joules</b> <b>per</b> <b>kelvin</b> (J/K) in the International System of Units. While {{these are the same}} units as heat capacity, the two concepts are distinct. Entropy is not a conserved quantity: for example, in an isolated system with non-uniform temperature, heat might irreversibly flow and the temperature become more uniform such that entropy increases. The second law of thermodynamics states that a closed system has entropy which may increase or otherwise remain constant. Chemical reactions cause changes in entropy and entropy {{plays an important role in}} determining in which direction a chemical reaction spontaneously proceeds.|$|R

The entropy of a pure crystalline structure can be 0 J mol−1 K−1 only at 0K, according to the third law of thermodynamics. However, this presupposes that the material forms a 'perfect crystal' without any frozen in entropy (defects, dislocations), which is never completely true because crystals always grow at a finite temperature. However this residual entropy is often quite negligible.|$|R
50|$|Paraffin wax is an {{excellent}} material for storing heat, with a specific heat capacity of 2.14-2.9 J g−1 K−1 (<b>joules</b> <b>per</b> gram <b>kelvin)</b> and a heat of fusion of 200-220 J g−1. This property is exploited in modified drywall for home building material: {{a certain type of}} wax (with the right melting point) is infused in the drywall during manufacture so that it melts during the day, absorbing heat, and solidifies again at night, releasing the heat. Paraffin wax phase-change cooling coupled with retractable radiators was used to cool the electronics of the Lunar Rover. Wax expands considerably when it melts and this allows its use in wax element thermostats for industrial, domestic and, particularly, automobile purposes.|$|R
50|$|In the United States {{other units}} of measure for heat {{capacity}} may be quoted in disciplines such as construction, civil engineering, and chemical engineering. A still common {{system is the}} English Engineering Units in which the mass reference is pound mass and the temperature is specified in degrees Fahrenheit or Rankine. One (rare) unit of heat is the pound calorie (lb-cal), defined {{as the amount of}} heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Celsius. On this scale the specific heat of water would be 1 lb-cal/(K⋅lb). More common is the British thermal unit, the standard unit of heat in the U.S. construction industry. This is defined such that the specific heat of water is 1 BTU/(F°⋅lb).The path integral Monte Carlo method is a numerical approach for determining the values of heat capacity, based on quantum dynamical principles.
