5|$|Additionally, {{the award}} system from Corruption was {{incorporated}} into the first two games. Players earn credits by accomplishing certain tasks, allowing them to unlock in-game items such as artwork, music, a screenshot feature, decorative items for Samus' ship in Corruption and the Fusion Suit in Prime, in which the latter was previously unlocked by connecting the Game Boy Advance title Metroid Fusion to the game. Credits could also be shared with registered Wii friends, who also {{have a copy of}} Trilogy, via WiiConnect24 which used the Wii's own 16-digit number as opposed to a separate Friend Code. Save <b>files</b> <b>from</b> the original version of Corruption cannot be transferred to the Trilogy version due to changes made to the source code. Trilogy also features the multiplayer mode from Echoes, but is limited to a local four-player game and does not feature online play, which is faithful to the original. In response to complaints from players and critics about Echoess high difficulty during some of the boss battles, the difficulty of the encounters was lowered.|$|E
