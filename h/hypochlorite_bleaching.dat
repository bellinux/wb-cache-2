500|$|Chlorine gas {{was first}} used by French chemist Claude Berthollet to bleach {{textiles}} in 1785. Modern bleaches resulted from further work by Berthollet, who first produced sodium hypochlorite in 1789 in his laboratory {{in the town of}} Javel (now part of Paris, France), by passing chlorine gas through a solution of sodium carbonate. The resulting liquid, known as [...] "Eau de Javel" [...] ("Javel water"), was a weak solution of sodium hypochlorite. This process was not very efficient, and alternative production methods were sought. Scottish chemist and industrialist Charles Tennant first produced a solution of calcium hypochlorite ("chlorinated lime"), then solid calcium <b>hypochlorite</b> (<b>bleaching</b> powder). These compounds produced low levels of elemental chlorine and could be more efficiently transported than sodium hypochlorite, which remained as dilute solutions because when purified to eliminate water, it became a dangerously powerful and unstable oxidizer. Near {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, E. S. Smith patented a method of sodium hypochlorite production involving electrolysis of brine to produce sodium hydroxide and chlorine gas, which then mixed to form sodium hypochlorite. This is known as the chloralkali process, first introduced on an industrial scale in 1892, and now the source of most elemental chlorine and sodium hydroxide. In 1884 Chemischen Fabrik Griesheim of Germany developed another chloralkali process which entered commercial production in 1888.|$|E

50|$|Bleaching is {{a process}} for {{whitening}} fabrics which has been practiced for thousands of years.

In the 18th century several scientists developed varieties of chlorine bleach, including sodium hypochlorite and calcium <b>hypochlorite</b> (<b>bleaching</b> powder). Bleaching agents that do not contain chlorine most often are based on peroxides, such as hydrogen peroxide, sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate. While most bleaches are oxidizing agents, a fewer number are reducing agents such as sodium dithionite.|$|E

Man made sodium salts contribution is nearly 7% of total salt load of all the rivers. Sodium salt load problem aggravates in the downstream of intensively cultivated river basins located in China, India, Egypt, Pakistan, west Asia, Australia, western US, etc. due to accumulation of salts in the remaining water after meeting various transpiration and evaporation losses.|$|E

40|$|Chlorine {{bleaching}} {{is still}} practiced by non-wood {{pulp and paper}} mills in China, resulting in considerable formation and emission of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). We investigate the distribution of PCDD/Fs in different papermaking processes and dioxin emissions at six typical Chinese non wood pulp and paper mills. Raw materials for papermaking included reed, wheat straw, bamboo, and sugar cane bagasse. The formation and emission of PCDD/Fs varied strikingly according to bleaching processes and raw materials. Elemental chlorine bleaching promoted the formation of tetra- to octa-CDDs and 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDF, while <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>bleaching</b> only {{gave rise to a}} significant increase of 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDF. Bleaching with elemental chlorine and hypochlorite increased 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDF 0. 9 - 42. 5 and 0. 3 - 4. 1 times, respectively. Most of the 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDF formed at <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>bleaching</b> stage was partitioned into the effluent, which indicated that <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>bleaching</b> was also an important emission source of dioxins. The removal of PCDD/Fs occurred visibly during alkaline digestion, alkaline extraction, and hydrogen peroxide bleaching.

40|$|A {{study was}} done to {{determine}} the kinetics and stoichiometry of <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>bleaching</b> of pinus radiata kraft pulp obtained from the extraction stage of a chlorine, caustic extraction and hypochlorite (CEH) bleaching sequence. The "differential method" of experimentation was used, where bleaching chemicals are charged {{at the start of}} the experiment and allowed to decrease as bleaching proceeds. The bleaching rate is found to be dependent on temperature, chromophore concentration (approximated by the specific light absorption coefficient), hypochlorite ion concentration (OCl-) and hydroxide ion concentration (alkalinity, OH-).

Results show that the absorption of light by particulate matter is almost totally dependent on the phytoplankton, with no significant contribution from non-algal particles, both in coastal and oceanic waters. Specific phytoplankton coefficients show significant fluctuations between seasons and stations, ranging from 0. 012 to 0. 038 at 678 nm. Particulate absorption is dominant over dissolved absorption.

40|$|The early {{observation}} that chlorination was an effective delignification agent of wood {{eventually led to}} the commercial Pomilio pulping process and to the alkaline <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>bleaching</b> of wood pulps. The study of the lignin products from these and other chlorination processes suffered from the presence of the carbohydrate fraction and from the pressure of the industrial point of view. Moreover, the conditions employed in industry were not necessarily the most advantageous for fundamental lignin studies, so that many lignin products were often highly chlorinated and badly degraded. This circumstance led to the abandonment of chlorination as a means of studying lignin structure. Some years ago, it was found possible to isolate most of the lignin from wood in a state that was only slightly chemically changed. The product, periodate lignin, was a light brown powder retaining the original morphological detail of the wood and differing from most other isolated lignins in retaining the original insolubility of lignin in organic solvents, while still behaving as lignin in situ towards a standard bisulfite cook. The availability of this material meant that fundamental studies could now be performed without the complication of the carbohydrate fraction. The effect of chlorine under alkaline conditions was then investigated on periodate lignin and it was shown that minimum oxidation and chlorination occurred at about pH 12. [ [...] . ...|$|E
