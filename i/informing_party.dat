50|$|For example, {{two people}} are {{bargaining}} over dividing money or provisions. One party may know {{the size of the}} amount being divided while the other does not.

40|$|How {{should a}} court set legal {{standards}} of negligence or performance when one party {{to a potential}} future tort or contract case will be uninformed about the standards set by the court? Since the court cannot affect {{the behavior of the}} uninformed party, it might set the standard for the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> at that level which is optimal given the behavior that can be expected of the uninformed. Thus, if the court expects the uninformed to take more than optimal care, it might set a lower than first best standard for the <b>informed</b> <b>party.</b> However, there are circumstances in which the court should maintain the first best standard for the <b>informed</b> <b>party,</b> namely when the uninformed party understands the risk and realizes that the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> has an incentive to take due care to avoid liability. The uninformed party will then expect to bear the loss himself and will take adequate precautions. Hence, in the oft-occurring situation where the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> is the injurer and acts first, it can be possible to induce the first best outcome under the negligence rule; the negligence rule may then, due to its discontinuity, be superior to strict liability. Maintaining the first best standard for the uninformed victim may, on the other hand, not be optimal; it is a weakly dominant strategy for the court to set a lower standard, since doing so will increase the <b>informed</b> <b>party’s</b> incentive to take due care without affecting the behavior of the uninformed party. When the conditions under which first best can (in theory) be realized are not met, as when it is not rational for the victim to believe that the injurer acts with due care, the task for the court is {{complicated by the fact that}} it may be optimal to either raise or lower the standard of due care for the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> compared with the first best. As a further complication, which standards are optimal depend on whether the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> is the victim or the injurer and on who acts first...|$|R
40|$|When a court sets {{standards}} of due {{care in a}} tort or contract case {{with a view to}} how the standards will affect future behavior of parties similar to the litigants, it should sometimes realize that only one of the two future parties is likely to become informed of the standards. The standards can then only have a direct effect on the behavior of the <b>informed</b> <b>party,</b> and it may be thought that the court should hold the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> strictly liable, which maximizes this effect. However, this ignores that the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> may, although strictly liable, lower her level of care in order to induce the uninformed party to take greater care. In this situation, the negligence rule may do better than strict liability, since the discontinuity of the negligence rule can prevent the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> from strategically lowering her level of care. Under the negligence rule, optimal standards are sensitive to whether the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> acts first and to whether she is the injurer or the victim. For both the informed and the uninformed, there are circumstances in which the standard should be higher than first best and other circumstances where it should be lower...|$|R
40|$|Arrangement {{making is}} {{understood}} to be a “closing-relevant action” (Schegloff and Sacks 1973), but {{little attention has been}} given to how people arrive at mutually acceptable plans for the future. Telephone conversations between clients and staff of community and home care (CHC) services were studied to identify how arrangements for future services were made. A recurrent sequence was observed in which clients were informed of future arrangement and were prompted to reply with “response solicitation” (Jefferson 1981). Response solicitations were observed at two points: either tagged to the end of an informing, or following a recipient’s response to the informing. We show how response solicitations are routinely used in instances where recipients have some discretion in relation to the arrangement under discussion. They are a means by which an <b>informing</b> <b>party</b> can display to their interlocutor that they, as recipient, have some discretion to exercise in the matter. These findings are discussed with reference to prior research on arrangement making in other settings, which suggests the general nature of this practice. Stuart Ekberg and Amanda LeCouteu...|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} on asymmetric {{information has been}} concerned mainly {{with the problem of}} the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> lying to the uninformed parties. However, in many cases, the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> will stop short of lying but will seek to gain from private information by managing the disclosure of news. This article examines the pricing of a firm when there is such manipulation of news. I model this situation as a variant of the "persuasion game" of Milgrom and Roberts (1986) in which I can parameterize the notion of the degree of credence placed by the market on the disclosures of the <b>informed</b> <b>party.</b> An empirical hypothesis thrown up by the theory is that for otherwise identical firms, a low price/earnings ratio will be associated with a greater degree of positive skewness of the disclosure strategy. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} optimal negligence standards {{when only}} one of two (future) <b>parties</b> will be <b>informed</b> of the standards. When the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> is the injurer and acts first, the simple negligence rule is optimal, and under certain conditions, the first best standard of due care is optimal. The <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> will {{have an incentive to}} comply with the standard due to the discontinuity of the negligence rule, whereas the uninformed party may infer this and hence also take appropriate precautions. In general, the optimal policy for the court depends on who acts first and on who the injurer is. Thus, optimal rules are contributory negligence when the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> is the victim and acts first, no liability when the uninformed party is the injurer and acts first, and strict liability without contributory negligence when the uninformed party is the victim and acts first.

40|$|In this paper, a {{party with}} private {{information}} can verifiably disclose some, but not all, of his information. The optimal amount of discretion to allow the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> is studied. That is, should the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> be allowed unlimited discretion in choosing which elements of his information set to disclose, or should restrictions be imposed that limit this discretion? The model is formulated {{in the spirit of}} a "persuasion game. " It is demonstrated that, under certain circumstances, rules that limit discretion increase the informativeness of disclosures and, thus, improve economic decisions.

The analysis focuses on {{the link between the}} market participants' productive activities and discretionary disclosures. While informed parties' discretion over disclosure allows them to earn private gains, it leads to an inefficient allocation of resources. A more informative signal makes the <b>informed</b> <b>parties</b> better off, but reduces the uninformed parties' welfare. Nonetheless, it improves the economy's allocative efficiency. The paper also shows that when the signal quality is endogenous, the <b>informed</b> <b>parties</b> over-invest in the signal informativeness relative to the level that maximizes social welfare.

We characterize the conditions on the information that the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> can certify and more general conditions on players' preferences, which are sufficient for the existence and uniqueness of a separating equilibrium outcome. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{identify}} two {{features of}} final offer arbitration (FOA) which may impede settlement in a bargaining game where asymmetric information drives {{the failure to}} settle. First, under FOA the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> has an incentive not to voluntarily reveal private information. Revealing this information allows the previously uninformed party to submit a superior offer to the arbitrator {{to the detriment of}} the <b>informed</b> <b>party.</b> Second, in a two-type model, the uninformed player may choose to arbitrate all cases, a result which never occurs in a simple litigation game. Such a strategy allows this player to commit to an offer in arbitration that is optimal against the entire distribution of types with whom he must bargain. Each player's offer directly affects the outcome of arbitration under FOA, and it is this feature that generates impediments to settlement that are not observed in a simple litigation game. Both impediments to settlement are removed if bargaining is allowed to take place after potentially binding offers have been submitted to the arbitrator...|$|R
40|$|Consider {{a setting}} {{commonly}} found in intrafirm, regulatory, and political relationships wherein an uninformed decision maker, attempting to elicit information from an <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> affected by his decision, is unable to use transfers. This article examines whether both parties will agree on the introduction of communication-based organizational structures; results in prior research suggest they will. In contrast we demonstrate that when there is enough disagreement between the two parties, introducing communication benefits the decision maker but leads to a loss for the <b>informed</b> <b>party.</b> This result holds both when the decision maker can commit to a decision rule (as in Holmstom (1977)) and when he cannot (as in Crawford and Sobel (1982)). We also show that in the commitment case, with enough disagreement, the optimal communication-based decision rule is discontinuous. Our results suggest a possible rationale for observed legal and regulatory limitations on the information decision makers can elicit from other parties, {{as well as for}} attempts by various parties to avoid preplay communication. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{strategic}} interaction between large institutional investors and firms that issue put options written {{on their own}} stock. The firms experience large positive abnormal annual returns after they sell put options. The vast majority of issued put options expire without being exercised, and the buyers of these options, which are predominantly investment banks, lose money. We propose a model that gives a rationale why an uniformed party, an investment bank will trade in put options with an <b>informed</b> <b>party,</b> the issuing firm, although the expected profits from this trade are negative. The model shows how trading with an <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> can be profitable because the bank can acquire valuable information and afterwards earn abnormal returns on trades in other securities of the same firm.

50|$|There is also {{a second}} reason why section 13(2) would be more {{efficient}} then section 13(1) for items such as wedding photos. This reason {{is that there is}} probably asymmetry of information between the photographer and the client, meaning that the photographer is probably aware of the copyright rules while the client is probably not. Under the section 13(2) rule, because the client is initially vested with copyright, the photographer has to ask to buy the copyright from the client if the photographer wants the copyright. In the course of the negotiation, the client would become informed about the law. In this, section 13(2) is efficient in that it creates an incentive for more <b>informed</b> <b>parties</b> to share that information with less <b>informed</b> <b>parties.</b> As there is greater symmetry of information between the parties, transaction costs are less and bargaining is easier. However, if the photographer is the first owner of the copyright, he has no need to ask his client about purchase of the copyright and consequently {{it is unlikely that the}} client will learn about the copyright on the photographs.|$|R
