Drosophila suzukii was the only drosophilid species infesting <b>fresh</b> wild <b>cherry</b> fruits, and Ganaspis individuals were the major parasitoids attacking D. suzukii in wild cherry fruits. In parasitism experiments, these Ganaspis individuals parasitized D. suzukii larvae in <b>fresh</b> <b>cherry</b> fruits, but did not parasitize those in Drosophila medium.

40|$|Consumer's {{demand for}} sweet cherry has {{increased}} {{due to its}} sweet taste, attractive colour and high amounts of antioxidants. However, the fruit is highly perishable with a limited shelf life of 7 – 10 days, {{and in some cases}} fails to reach the consumer at optimal quality after being transported to the market. Loss of firmness, colour and flavour, stem discoloration, desiccation and mould growth limit their shelf life over extended periods of time.

40|$|Texture is {{a primary}} quality {{attribute}} of brined sweet cherries (Prunus avium L.) and its preservation is a major objective for candying industry. In order to identify the harvest factors influencing textural changes during long period brine storage, different itineraries were applied: harvest at two different maturity stages, treatment or not with ethephon, manual or mechanical harvest, removal or not of peduncles. The cherries were immersed in brine and examined over a 12 -months period for firmness, calcium and total soluble solids diffusion and cytohistological remodelling. Mechanical harvesting, harvest at late maturity stage and storage with peduncle decreased firmness while ethephon treatment had no effect.

40|$|As the {{population}} tends to urbanize, the potential consumer market of fresh produce becomes {{distant from the}} producing farm. This distance brings to growers and handlers the problems of how to keep their fresh products unspoiled after harvest and during transit period of shipping, {{and how they can}} be delivered to the specified destination without substantial deterioration. It is the common interest of fruit growers, shippers, wholesalers, and retailers that the shelf-life of fresh fruit be prolonged to increase sales. Sweet cherries are one of the important fruit crops in Utah. Being highly perishable, <b>fresh</b> sweet <b>cherries</b> have relatively short storage life after harvest. It is known that the approximate limit for the successful commercial storage of <b>fresh</b> sweet <b>cherries</b> is about 10 days to 2 weeks only. A practicable measure for extending this storage limit has to be established so that the market may have <b>fresh</b> sweet <b>cherries</b> over a longer season and also be able to balance the time of plenty and the time of scarcity. Furthermore, the Utah grown cherries may find new outlets in the distant market. Thus the benefit will be shared by the grower, the seller, and the consumer. Metabolic breakdown and fungal deterioration are the two important factors which cause the spoilage of fruits. Studies have shown that with many perishable produces, precooling [...] the prompt application of refrigeration prior 2 to normal storage or transportation is the key to successful storage. Hydro -cooling treatment is considered to be advantageous especially in Utah, where high temperature and low relative humidity predominate during the harvest season of sweet cherries. Post-harvest chemical and packaging treatments of sweet cherries are possible approaches on ext ending the keeping quality of the fruits concerned. With some of the antifungal agents available today, the fungi which cause fruit decay might be successfully controlled. As a matter of fact, new fungicides, antifungal antibiotics, and packaging films are continuously developed by the industries in the United States. Appropriate combination of these newly developed materials with hydro-cooling followed by refrigerated storage, coupled with in vitro study of the effects of chemicals on fruit decay organisms, might lead to an improvement in the storage life of sweet cherries. It was with this idea in mind that experiments were conducted to study the effects of hydro-cooling, chemicals, and packaging treatments on preserving <b>fresh</b> sweet <b>cherries</b> and also in vitro effects of chemicals on certain fungi responsible for fruit deterioration...|$|R

This effort was successful. We were able to excise immature flowers from Pixie tomato plants grown in a controlled condition room, implant them on artificial media under aseptic conditions, and get them to develop into edible fruits in a little over a month. The medium (Murashige-Skoog) was purchased from Sigma, supplemented with sugar plus a synthetic analog of the plant hormone cytokinin, and adjusted to pH 5. 8.

To ensure a steady supply of such tomatoes, we found it possible to store the explanted flower buds in MS medium at 5 C for at least 6 weeks without significant loss of ability to develop into fruits. This means that many containers could be prepared before launch and put into a refrigerator; a convenient number could then be removed periodically to guarantee a succession of harvests during the life of an extended mission.

This fruit beer ‘kriek’ is a school example of beer mixed drinks and originally kriek is produced by addition of <b>fresh</b> sour <b>cherries</b> to mid-young lambic beer (spontaneous fermentation). The traditional kriek beer is less fruity and more acid.

The characterisation of the Belgian kriek beers is performed by analytical flavour profiling, including higher alcohols, ethyl esters, acetate esters and aldehydes, by headspace solid phase microextraction in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS), and by quantitative determination of the bittering profiles, organic acids and sugars by high pressure liquid chromatography.
