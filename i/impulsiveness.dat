5|$|In 1902 Henson married Isabella (Ella) Caroline (1870–1949), {{the only}} {{daughter}} of James Wallis Dennistoun of Dennistoun, Scotland. Grimley comments {{that it was}} in keeping with Henson's usual <b>impulsiveness</b> that he proposed within four days of meeting her. The marriage was lifelong; there were no children.|$|E
5|$|A sea shore. As Goffredo, Eustazio and Rinaldo {{near the}} magician's lair, a {{beautiful}} woman calls from her boat, promising Rinaldo that she can take him to Almirena. Two mermaids sing of love's delights, and urge Rinaldo {{to go in the}} boat. He hesitates, unsure what to do, and his companions attempt to restrain him. Angry at the abduction of his loved one, Rinaldo enters the boat, which immediately sails off. Goffredo and Eustazio are shocked at Rinaldo's <b>impulsiveness</b> and believe that he has deserted their cause.|$|E
5|$|Amfortas arrives, borne on a {{stretcher}} by Knights of the Grail. He calls out for Gawain, whose attempt at relieving the King's pain had failed. He is told that Gawain has left again, seeking a better remedy. Raising himself somewhat, the King says going off without leave ("?") {{is the sort of}} <b>impulsiveness</b> which led himself into Klingsor's realm and to his downfall. He accepts the potion from Gurnemanz and tries to thank Kundry, but she answers abruptly that thanks will not help and urges him onward to his bath.|$|E
5|$|Seizing the {{opportunity}} the predicament presented, Eisenhower used Patton as a decoy in Operation Fortitude, sending faulty intelligence to German agents that Patton {{was leading the}} Invasion of Europe. While Patton eventually returned to combat command in the European Theater in mid-1944, the slapping incidents were seen by Eisenhower, Marshall, and other leaders to be examples of Patton's brashness and <b>impulsiveness.</b> Patton's career was halted as former subordinates such as Omar Bradley became his superiors.|$|E
5|$|Chizuru, nicknamed Chii-chan, {{is a tall}} {{girl who}} first appears as a classmate of Shuichi when they both enter junior high school. She is Momoko's {{childhood}} friend, and has a stylish demeanor, highlighted by her stature and long hair, which captivates both Shuichi and Yoshino when they first meet her. Chizuru {{is described as a}} free spirit, someone who enjoys doing unconventional, often outrageous things which surprise those around her; she frequently acts without thinking, and as a result projects a childish personality. Her impulsive behavior sometimes gets her in trouble with other characters, but she quickly becomes ashamed when she realizes the consequences. She tries to be everyone's friend, though Saori strongly dislikes her <b>impulsiveness.</b> Chizuru joins the girls' basketball team in junior high. Her family runs a soba restaurant.|$|E
5|$|However, {{others found}} that the {{bundling}} of the games was a sensible business decision, most highlighting {{the risk that the}} sales of Remastered could overshadow those of Infinite Warfare and result in direct competition between the two. Stephen Wright of Gamespresso, meanwhile, agreed with Activision based around the <b>impulsiveness</b> of the Call of Duty fanbase, writing that due to the series' popularity, many of the individuals who felt discontent towards a new title would still choose to buy it regardless. As such, Activision had released the bundle with the knowledge that fans would certainly purchase Infinite Warfare in order to obtain a remaster of Modern Warfare, a game that was held in such high regard. While Wright did disagree with having to pay for an unwanted game in order to obtain another, he expressed faith that the bundle would be good value for money.|$|E
5|$|Securely {{attached}} adults tend to {{have positive}} views of themselves, their partners and their relationships. They feel comfortable with intimacy and independence, balancing the two. Anxious-preoccupied adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They {{tend to be less}} trusting, have less positive views about themselves and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and <b>impulsiveness</b> in their relationships. Dismissive-avoidant adults desire a high level of independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. They tend to suppress their feelings, dealing with rejection by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Fearful-avoidant adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness. They tend to mistrust their partners and view themselves as unworthy. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults tend to seek less intimacy, suppressing their feelings.|$|E

25|$|As noted above, {{procrastination}} {{is consistently}} {{found to be}} strongly correlated with conscientiousness, and moderately so with <b>impulsiveness.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} and early gholas, his character had been dominated by <b>impulsiveness.</b> Quick to hate, quick to give loyalty. Later Idaho-gholas tempered this with cynicism but the underlying <b>impulsiveness</b> remained. The Tyrant had called it to action many times. Bellonda recognized a pattern. He can be goaded by pride. His long service to the Tyrant fascinated her. Not only had he been a Mentat several times but there was evidence {{he had been a}} Truthsayer in more than one incarnation.|$|E
25|$|No {{medications}} {{are indicated}} for treating NPD, {{but may be}} used to treat co-occurring mental conditions or symptoms that may be associated with it such as depression, anxiety, and <b>impulsiveness</b> if present.|$|E
25|$|An {{approach}} that integrates several core theories of motivation {{as well as}} meta-analytic research on procrastination is the temporal motivation theory. It summarizes key predictors of procrastination (expectancy, value, and <b>impulsiveness)</b> into a mathematical equation.|$|E
25|$|Rash <b>Impulsiveness</b> (RI) – {{reflecting}} {{individual differences}} {{in the ability to}} modify the addictive behaviour due to negative consequences. Individuals high in RI are oblivious or insensitive to the negative consequences as a result of addictive behaviour when engagement is craved.|$|E
25|$|Piers Steel {{indicated}} in 2010 that anxiety {{is just as}} likely to get people to start working early as late, and that the focus of studies on procrastination should be <b>impulsiveness.</b> That is, anxiety will cause people to delay only if they are impulsive.|$|E
25|$|Eysenck {{originally}} {{suggested that}} extraversion {{was a combination}} of two major tendencies, <b>impulsiveness</b> and sociability. He later added several other more specific traits, namely liveliness, activity level, and excitability. These traits are further linked in his personality hierarchy to even more specific habitual responses, such as partying on the weekend.|$|E
25|$|Simmons moved for {{the trial}} court to set aside the {{conviction}} and sentence, citing, in part, ineffective assistance of counsel. His age, and thus <b>impulsiveness,</b> along with a troubled background, were brought up as issues that Simmons claimed should have been raised at the sentencing phase. The trial court rejected the motion, and Simmons appealed.|$|E
25|$|P - Psychoticism/Socialisation: Psychoticism is {{associated}} {{not only with}} the liability to have a psychotic episode (or break with reality), but also with aggression. Psychotic behavior is rooted in the characteristics of toughmindedness, non-conformity, inconsideration, recklessness, hostility, anger and <b>impulsiveness.</b> The physiological basis suggested by Eysenck for psychoticism is testosterone, with higher levels of psychoticism associated with higher levels of testosterone.|$|E
25|$|Personality {{profiles}} of recreational divers were analysed in a 2010 study on entry level divers: The participants scored high on self-sufficiency, <b>impulsiveness</b> and boldness and low on warmth, sensitivity and conformity, and {{differed from the}} typical extreme sport participant's personality profile. Personality types identified include adventurer, dreamer, rationalist and passive-aggressive macho diver, and results suggested that the risk-behaviour likely to be exhibited by the diver would depend on their personality type.|$|E
25|$|Wilson's disease (WD) {{is a rare}} {{inherited}} {{disorder in}} which patients have a problem metabolizing copper. In patients with WD, copper accumulates in the liver {{and other parts of}} the body, particularly the brain, eyes and kidneys. Upon accumulation in the brain, patients may experience speech problems, incoordination, swallowing problems, and prominent hyperkinetic symptoms including tremor, dystonia, and gait difficulties. Psychiatric disturbances such as irritability, <b>impulsiveness,</b> aggressiveness, and mood disturbances are also common.|$|E
25|$|In the simulation, Leela {{shows off}} {{a new pair of}} boots, bought on a wild impulse - {{according}} to her. However, the only difference is a green stripe down the side, which is of no interest to anyone. The Professor tells Leela that he has designated her as his sole heir due to her lack of <b>impulsiveness.</b> Leela then kills Farnsworth on an impulse, kicking him into a pit housing his pet man-eating anteaters.|$|E
25|$|Astrologically speaking, Mars is {{associated}} with confidence and self-assertion, aggression, sexuality, energy, strength, ambition and <b>impulsiveness.</b> Mars governs sports, competitions and physical activities in general. The 1st-century poet Manilius, described the planet as ardent and as the lesser malefic. In medicine, Mars presides over the genitals, the muscular system, the gonads and adrenal glands. It was traditionally held to be hot and excessively dry and ruled the choleric humor. It was associated with fever, accidents, trauma, pain and surgery.|$|E
25|$|Health psychologists conduct {{research}} to identify behaviors and experiences that promote health, {{give rise to}} illness, and influence the effectiveness of health care. They also recommend ways to improve health care policy. Health psychologists have worked on developing ways to reduce smoking and improve daily nutrition {{in order to promote}} health and prevent illness. They have also studied the association between illness and individual characteristics. For example, health psychology has found a relation between the personality characteristics of thrill seeking, <b>impulsiveness,</b> hostility/anger, emotional instability, and depression, on one hand, and high-risk driving, on the other.|$|E
25|$|They {{also share}} traits {{with the work}} of Le Corbusier and Amédée Ozenfant who {{together}} had founded Purism, a style intended as a rational, mathematically based corrective to the <b>impulsiveness</b> of cubism. Combining the classical with the modern, Léger's Nude on a Red Background (1927) depicts a monumental, expressionless woman, machinelike in form and color. His still life compositions from this period are dominated by stable, interlocking rectangular formations in vertical and horizontal orientation. The Siphon of 1924, a still life based on an advertisement in the popular press for the aperitif Campari, represents the high-water mark of the Purist aesthetic in Léger's work. Its balanced composition and fluted shapes suggestive of classical columns are brought together with a quasi-cinematic close-up of a hand holding a bottle.|$|E
25|$|There are {{internal}} {{differences within}} Hindu traditions on reincarnation {{and the state}} of moksha. For example, the dualistic devotional traditions such as Madhvacharya's Dvaita Vedanta tradition of Hinduism champion a theistic premise, assert that human soul and Brahman are different, loving devotion to Brahman (god Vishnu in Madhvacharya's theology) is the means to release from Samsara, it is the grace of God which leads to moksha, and spiritual liberation is achievable only in after-life (videhamukti). The nondualistic traditions such as Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta tradition of Hinduism champion a monistic premise, asserting that the individual human soul and Brahman are identical, only ignorance, <b>impulsiveness</b> and inertia leads to suffering through Saṃsāra, in reality they are no dualities, meditation and self-knowledge is the path to liberation, the realization that one's soul is identical to Brahman is moksha, and spiritual liberation is achievable in this life (jivanmukti).|$|E
500|$|Smart {{also said}} of the opening scene that: [...] "It encapsulates that {{character}} in one moment and says so much about her <b>impulsiveness.</b> We could not have accomplished that with a dozen speeches. When I {{saw it in the}} script, I thought 'this is great, this lady is going to be fun to play.|$|E
500|$|Judgment {{refers to}} the patient's {{capacity}} to make sound, reasoned and responsible decisions. Traditionally, the MSE included the use of standard hypothetical questions such as [...] "what {{would you do if}} you found a stamped, addressed envelope lying in the street?"; however contemporary practice is to inquire about how the patient has responded or would respond to real-life challenges and contingencies. Assessment would take into account the individual's executive system capacity in terms of <b>impulsiveness,</b> social cognition, self-awareness and planning ability.|$|E
500|$|Patton {{had already}} {{developed}} a reputation in the U.S. Army as an effective, successful, and hard-driving commander, punishing subordinates for the slightest infractions but also rewarding them when they performed well. As a way to promote an image that inspired his troops, Patton created a larger-than-life personality. He became known for his flashy dress, highly polished helmet and boots, and no-nonsense demeanor. [...] General Dwight D. Eisenhower, {{the commander of the}} Sicily operation and Patton's friend and commanding officer, had long known of Patton's colorful leadership style, and also knew that Patton was prone to <b>impulsiveness</b> and a lack of self-restraint.|$|E
500|$|Chris Turner cites {{scenes from}} the episode in {{describing}} Homer's characteristic qualities in his book [...] Turner notes that the episode illustrates Homer's <b>impulsiveness,</b> silliness, and [...] "physical stupidity". Contributor Raja Halwani writes in the compilation work [...] that the episode shows Homer's tendency to habitually lie to Marge, and cites Homer's covering for Patty and Selma when they are caught smoking as a positive aspect of his character. The episode received positive mention from Turner in Planet Simpson, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood in their book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, and Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide.|$|E
500|$|TBI {{may cause}} emotional, social, or {{behavioral}} problems {{and changes in}} personality. [...] These may include emotional instability, depression, anxiety, hypomania, mania, apathy, irritability, problems with social judgment, and impaired conversational skills. [...] TBI appears to predispose survivors to psychiatric disorders including obsessive compulsive disorder, substance abuse, dysthymia, clinical depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders. In patients who have depression after TBI, suicidal ideation is not uncommon; the suicide rate among these persons is increased 2- to 3-fold. Social and behavioral symptoms that can follow TBI include disinhibition, inability to control anger, <b>impulsiveness,</b> lack of initiative, inappropriate sexual activity, asociality and social withdrawal, and changes in personality.|$|E
500|$|Chris Turner {{writes in}} his book [...] that the episode {{illustrates}} how Homer Simpson is [...] "an organism of considerable complexity". Turner comments, [...] "Homer is carrying the full symbolic weight of twentieth-century America on his shoulders, and no garden-variety doofus could manage that task." [...] Turner discusses a moment from the episode where Marge tells her sisters, [...] "Homer doesn't mean to be rude, he's just a very complicated man", after which Homer breaks a plate {{over his head and}} shouts [...] "Wrong!" [...] Turner writes that this [...] "revelatory moment" [...] is illustrative of [...] "several of the best-known aspects of Homer's character: his <b>impulsiveness,</b> his inherent silliness, his evident, even physical stupidity".|$|E
500|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} artist's work was this choice of classical subjects. In 1946, Bellette's paintings were hung in at least four separate exhibitions. Reviewers commented on her synthesis of [...] "the <b>impulsiveness</b> of romanticism and the deliberateness of classicism", and her [...] "romantically classical" [...] approach. Despite the generally positive views, there were some reservations, particularly that the artist might be at risk of settling upon, and then repeating, a formula in her work. Bellette's treatment of classical subjects extended beyond conventional painting; in 1947 she created a textile design, titled [...] "myths and legends", and in 1948 she created the sets for a production of Shakespeare's Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Her [...] "vigorous imaginativeness" [...] was well reviewed, though the acting was not.|$|E
500|$|Allison Mack was {{disappointed}} that the character [...] "lost some of her backbone" [...] in the second season. The second season was about exploring Chloe's heart, {{and the idea of}} her being this [...] "lovelorn [...] angsty teenager". As Mack describes her, [...] " [...] was a little spineless and a little bit too much of a pushover [...]" [...] Mack does believe {{that by the end of}} the season Chloe manages to get some of that integrity back. The actress likes to make sure that her character is kept [...] "smart" [...] and [...] "ambitious", but at the end of season two Chloe's <b>impulsiveness</b> causes her to get stuck under Lionel's control, when she [...] "spitefully" [...] agrees to uncover Clark's secrets for Lionel Luthor after Clark is not honest with her about his newly established relationship with Lana.|$|E
500|$|Allison Mack characterizes Chloe {{as being}} a [...] "misfit" [...] during the first season; more of [...] "a really smart girl with attitude". She goes on to {{describe}} Chloe as intelligent and independent. Another of Chloe's defining characteristics is her need to [...] "expose falsehoods" [...] and find the truth in every situation. The character is curious, and wants {{to be honest with}} people. She is always {{trying to make sense of}} the situation. Next to her curiosity, her <b>impulsiveness</b> is a key characteristic that eventually leaves her under the control of Lionel Luthor, when she offers to uncover information on Clark for Lionel. The reason for this betrayal is based on Chloe's love for Clark. As Allison Mack explains, Chloe is so blinded by her love for Clark that she neglects to see all of the mistakes that he makes. It is this unrequited love for Clark that [...] "drives [...] to be as ambitious and as focused as she is".|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 1901 season, team captain Hugh White gave head coach Fielding Yost and trainer Keene Fitzpatrick substantial credit for the performance of the 1901 team. He credited the coach with [...] "inoculating into the men some of Mr. Yost's own spirit, <b>impulsiveness</b> and optimism," [...] and with having the [...] "faculty of adapting his plays to the material at hand so that he got the best there was out of every one of the eleven men." [...] With respect to the trainer, White noted:"An equally strong element, and one many are apt to overlook, was the work of Keene Fitzpatrick. Consider a team training nearly four months, without a man going stale, and but one injured so that he had to be taken out of the game! Then in addition a trip of nearly 3000 miles, from a climate where the thermometer registered 10 degrees below zero, into one of summer weather, and eleven men playing through an entire game and finishing it with faster and stronger play than at the beginning! Such were the results achieved by our trainer. ... Too much praise cannot be given him." ...|$|E
500|$|Early psychoanalytic critics saw {{the problem}} of Romeo and Juliet in terms of Romeo's <b>impulsiveness,</b> {{deriving}} from [...] "ill-controlled, partially disguised aggression", which leads both to Mercutio's death and to the double suicide. Romeo and Juliet is {{not considered to be}} exceedingly psychologically complex, and sympathetic psychoanalytic readings of the play make the tragic male experience equivalent with sicknesses. Norman Holland, writing in 1966, considers Romeo's dream as a realistic [...] "wish fulfilling fantasy both in terms of Romeo's adult world and his hypothetical childhood at stages oral, phallic and oedipal" [...] – while acknowledging that a dramatic character is not a human being with mental processes separate from those of the author. Critics such as Julia Kristeva focus on the hatred between the families, arguing that this hatred is the cause of Romeo and Juliet's passion for each other. That hatred manifests itself directly in the lovers' language: Juliet, for example, speaks of [...] "my only love sprung from my only hate" [...] and often expresses her passion through an anticipation of Romeo's death. This leads on to speculation as to the playwright's psychology, in particular to a consideration of Shakespeare's grief for the death of his son, Hamnet.|$|E
500|$|The series {{begins with}} a new arrival, {{surgical}} registrar Caroline Todd (Tamsin Greig). Caroline suffers from constant embarrassment and bad luck, stumbling from one crisis to the next due to a mixture of her own neurosis, <b>impulsiveness,</b> and general misfortune. Caroline works alongside two other doctors: Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan), an arrogant, half-Swiss, womanizing anaesthetist, and [...] "Mac" [...] Macartney (Julian Rhind-Tutt), a suave, desirably fashionable surgeon. It is not long before Caroline begins to develop feelings for both of them, though she is unsure as to {{which of the two}} she truly loves. Throughout the series, it becomes clear that Mac is her true love, but a range of misadventures prevent their relationship from flourishing. Other people Caroline meets include Martin Dear (Karl Theobald), a friendly house officer who is constantly failing his exams. He is unloved by his mother and is often bullied by Guy. Martin soon develops feelings for Caroline, and begins {{to fall in love with}} her. There is also Angela Hunter (Sarah Alexander), a seemingly-perfect, but irritating, senior registrar in pediatrics. Whilst Angela appears to mean well, Caroline cannot stand her and despite her best efforts to avoid Angela, she ends up as Caroline's lodger.|$|E
