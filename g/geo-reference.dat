40|$|Natural {{language}} place descriptions {{in everyday}} communication provide {{a rich source}} of spatial knowledge about places. An important step to utilize such knowledge in information systems is <b>geo-referencing</b> all the places referred to in these descriptions. Current techniques for <b>geo-referencing</b> places from text documents are using place name recognition and disambiguation; however, place descriptions often contain place references that are not known by gazetteers, or that are expressed in other, more flexible ways. Hence, the approach for <b>geo-referencing</b> presented in this paper starts from a place graph that contains the place references as well as spatial relationships extracted from place descriptions. Spatial relationships are used to constrain the locations of places and allow the later best-matching process for <b>geo-referencing.</b> The novel <b>geo-referencing</b> process results in higher precision and recall compared to state-of-art toponym resolution approaches on several tested place description datasets.

50|$|One area {{in which}} CBDB could be used is prosopographical research. By {{combining}} geographic information system (GIS) software with CBDB, patterns could be mapped out through queries generated from large datasets, for instance, who came from a certain place and what were the social and kinship connections among all those who entered government through the civil service examination from a certain place within a certain span of years, etc. One useful <b>geo-reference</b> tool {{for the study of}} Chinese history is the China Historical GIS (CHGIS) project, which makes datasets of the administrative units between 221 BC and 1911 AD and major towns for the 1820-1911 period freely available.

40|$|Combined {{processing}} {{using different}} sensor types, i. e. for applications like change detection, requires a good <b>geo-referencing.</b> Fur-thermore the individual sensor properties {{have to be}} taken into account. SAR systems are side-looking and run-time systems. They suffer from occlusions and ambiguities especially in urban areas. Additionally layover and shadow effects disturb the <b>geo-referencing</b> of SAR images in urban areas, which is a prerequisite for a successful change detection. An improved <b>geo-referencing</b> can be achieved by simulating 3 D-city models or street datasets using a SAR simulator and comparing the simulated image to the real image. Correspondences between simulated and real image can be used for <b>geo-referencing</b> the image according to the coordinates of the 3 D-city model or street dataset. The <b>geo-referenced</b> dataset can afterwards be used for change detection analysis. SAR images represent a side-view of the three dimensional world. An automated change detection using SAR images should take this fact into consideration and therefore should use 3 D-models as reference for the change-detection. These models are simulated and the simulated image is compared to the <b>geo-referenced</b> image, revealing changes between the simulated model and the real image. 1...|$|R

5000|$|In {{public safety}} and law enforcement, gunshot {{location}} systems are often used in high crime areas for rapid alerts and awareness into the communications and dispatch center where the alerts are used to direct first responders {{to the scene of}} the gunfire, thus increasing arrests rates, improving officer safety, securing witnesses and evidence, and enhancing investigations, as well as in the long run deterring gun crimes, shootings and especially [...] "celebratory gunfire" [...] (the practice of shooting weapons in the air for fun). Gunshot location systems based upon wide-area acoustic surveillance coupled with persistent incident data storage transcends dispatch-only uses because reporting of urban gunfire (via calls to 9-1-1) can be as low as 25%, which means that law enforcement agencies and their crime analysts have incomplete data regarding true activity levels and patterns. With a wide-area acoustic surveillance based approach combined with a persistent repository of gunfire activity (i.e., a database), agencies have closer to 100% activity data that can be analyzed for patterns and trends to drive directed patrols and intelligence-led policing. Additional benefits include aiding investigators to find more forensic evidence to solve crimes and provide to prosecutors to strengthen court cases resulting in a higher conviction rate. With the accuracy of a gunshot location system and the ability to <b>geo-reference</b> to a specific street address, versus a dearth of information that typically is the case when citizens report gunfire incidents to 9-1-1, agencies can also infer shooters by comparing with known criminal locations, including those on parole and probation; investigators can also at times infer intended victims and hence predict and prevent reprisals.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} derive the {{three-dimensional}} camera position from the monocular camera vision, a <b>geo-reference</b> database is needed. Floor {{plan is a}} ubiquitous <b>geo-reference</b> database that every building refers to it during construction and facility maintenance. Comparing with other popular <b>geo-reference</b> database such as geo-tagged photos, the generation, update and maintenance of floor plan database does not require costly and time consuming survey tasks.

In contrast to other sensors, vision sensors typically yield vast information that needs complex strategies to permit use in real-time and on computationally con-strained platforms.

40|$|In {{fields of}} {{research}} such as archaeology, botany etc, researchers are often required to conduct {{what is known}} as “geo-referencing”, a task which requires interpreting natural language descriptions of specimen findings and estimating their geodetic coordinates.

40|$|Abstract — The {{instantaneous}} {{knowledge of}} road course, condition and traffic situation {{ahead of the}} vehicle is of major value {{for all kinds of}} driver assistance systems. In this paper, a method for self-generating an up-to-date road status map of the local area onboard a driving vehicle is presented. A commercial digital road map is not required, since vehicles generate the map based upon satellite based positioning (e. g. GPS) and vehicular ad hoc communication. The vehicles record <b>Geo-Reference</b> Points (GRP) for the driven track, which – besides their geographic location – also include dynamic information recorded by the vehicle, such as road condition, temperature and traffic status. A number of GRPs is combined to form a <b>Geo-Reference</b> List (GRL) which is broadcasted using vehicular ad hoc communication. By integrating received GRLs in the local data basis, a dynamic road status map of the local area can be created. The required market penetration is low (< 5 %) since only occasional communication with a vehicle on the opposite lane is required. In addition to the proposed scheme for self-generated maps, the paper presents first simulative and experimental results. I...|$|E

40|$|Despite a lot {{of recent}} research, photogrammetric {{reconstruction}} from crowd-sourced imagery is plagued {{by a number of}} recurrent problems. (i) The resulting models are chronically incomplete, because even touristic landmarks are photographed mostly from a few “canonical” viewpoints. (ii) Man-made constructions tend to exhibit repetitive structure and rotational symmetries, which lead to gross errors in the 3 D reconstruction and aggravate the problem of incomplete reconstruction. (iii) The models are normally not geo-referenced. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using sparse GNSS geo-tags from digital cameras to address these issues and push the boundaries of crowd-sourced photogrammetry. A small proportion of the images in Internet collections (≈  10  %) do possess geo-tags. While the individual geo-tags are very inaccurate, they nevertheless can help to address the problems above. By providing approximate <b>geo-reference</b> for partial reconstructions they make it possible to fuse those pieces into more complete models; the capability to fuse partial reconstruction opens up the possibility to be more restrictive in the matching phase and avoid errors due to repetitive structure; and collectively, the redundant set of low-quality geo-tags can provide reasonably accurate absolute <b>geo-reference.</b> We show that even few, noisy geo-tags can help to improve architectural models, compared to puristic structure-from-motion only based on image correspondence...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess {{co-registration}} errors in remote imagery through the AUGEO system, which consists of <b>geo-referenced</b> coloured tarps acting as terrestrial targets (TT), captured in the imagery and semi-automatically recognised by AUGEO 2. 0 ® software. This works as an add-on of ENVI® for image co-registration. To validate AUGEO, TT were placed in the ground, and remote images from satellite Quick Bird (QB), airplanes and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) were taken at several locations in Andalusia (southern Spain) in 2008 and 2009. Any <b>geo-referencing</b> system tested showed some error in comparison with the Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) -geo-referenced verification targets. Generally, the AUGEO system provided higher <b>geo-referencing</b> accuracy than the other systems tried. The root mean square errors (RMSE) from the panchromatic and multi-spectral QB images were around 8 and 9 m, respectively and, once co-registered by AUGEO, they were about 1. 5 and 2. 5 m, for the same images. Overlapping the QB-AUGEO-geo-referenced image and the National Geographic Information System (NGIS) produced a RMSE of 6. 5 m, which is hardly acceptable for precision agriculture. The AUGEO system efficiently <b>geo-referenced</b> farm airborne images with a mean accuracy of about 0. 5 - 1. 5 m, and the UAV images showed a mean accuracy of 1. 0 - 4. 0 m. The <b>geo-referencing</b> accuracy of an image refers to its consistency despite changes in its spatial resolution. A higher number of TT used in the <b>geo-referencing</b> process leads to a lower obtained RMSE. For example, for an image of 80 ha, about 10 and 17 TT were needed to get a RMSE less than about 2 and 1 m. Similarly, with the same number of TT, accuracy was higher for smaller plots as compared to larger plots. Precision agriculture requires high spatial resolution images (i. e., < 1. 5 m pixel- 1), accurately <b>geo-referenced</b> (errors < 1 - 2 m). With the current DGPS technology, satellite and airplane images hardly meet this <b>geo-referencing</b> requirement; consequently, additional co-registration effort is needed. This can be achieved using <b>geo-referenced</b> TT and AUGEO, mainly in areas where no notable hard points are available. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.
