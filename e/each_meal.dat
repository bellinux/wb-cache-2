He {{was constantly}} shackled with {{a form of}} manacles known as [...] "lily irons", a riveted handcuff that had two separate iron bands on each wrist that prevented bending of the wrist or use of the hands independently. Like all the male prisoners, a heavy iron ball {{at the end of}} a [...] long chain was manacled to one of his legs. Shackles were riveted closed about the ankles, which caused Powell's feet to swell considerably. Like all the prisoners, he had only a straw pallet on which to sit or lie, and a single blanket for warmth. The same meal was served four times a day: [...] Coffee or water, bread, salted pork, and beef or beef soup. On April 29, all the prisoners aboard the monitors and at the Old Capitol Prison were moved to newly constructed cells at the Washington Arsenal (now Fort Lesley J. McNair). The prisoners were not permitted to bathe or wash until May 4, at which time all bindings and clothes were removed and they were permitted to bathe in cold water in the presence of a soldier. In early May, General John F. Hartranft, special provost marshal overseeing the prisoners, began improving the living conditions. Powell and the other prisoners began to receive fresh clothing (including undergarments) more frequently, more food, and writing instruments (paper, pen, ink). When Powell was observed raising the iron ball to his head, Hartranft feared Powell might be contemplating suicide, and had the ball removed on June 2. Living conditions improved again on June 18, when the prisoners were given a box to sit on, outdoor exercise time each day, and reading material and chewing tobacco after <b>each</b> <b>meal.</b>|$|E

Conclusions: Patented new plate has designed an additional V-shaped grooves which can keep more oil and water stay in the plate, and this new plate can fix vegetable, fruit, protein in the proportion to be a balanced and healthy diet. New plate not only can reduce oil-water in the dish and the proportion of food can clearly teach student s to understand and develop good control their diet behavior...|$|R
