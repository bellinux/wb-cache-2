500|$|At Fairbanks, {{the three}} B-29s {{encountered}} significant headwinds; {{more than the}} [...] "slight" [...] headwinds observed up to this time. They had expected tailwinds from the jet stream, yet could complete the distance without them, but headwinds meant that Washington might be too far. At 7am Eastern War Time, aircraft Number 2 was over Northway, Alaska, and navigator Bill Townes determined that they were behind schedule. He said later, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>reported</b> that fact to General LeMay, {{he looked at me}} as if he thought it was my fault, so I retreated behind my bulkhead to check my figures." [...] Later, the airmen learned that the typhoon near Okinawa the week before had greatly affected the jet stream.|$|E
500|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, Ramsey was conscripted into the British Army on 24 June 1940. He was assigned to the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry and underwent his initial training in Truro, where he and other recruits were housed in a hotel commandeered by the army. Ramsey found the experience a thrilling adventure. [...] "Until I travelled to Cornwall, the longest journey I had undertaken was a trip to Brighton by train," [...] he recalled. [...] "It was the first time I had ever been into a hotel! Even with us sleeping twelve to a room, on straw mattresses, could not end for me the awe of living in a swagger hotel." [...] "That set the tone for Alf's war," [...] Leo McKinstry suggests in his 2010 biography; attached to his regiment's 6th Battalion, Ramsey spent the entire war in Britain on home defence duties. The training was still physically demanding though, and, in Ramsey's words, made him [...] "a fitter young fellow than when <b>I</b> <b>reported</b> for duty as a grocery apprentice from Dagenham".|$|E
2500|$|In December 2002, a {{representative}} of the head of Iraqi Intelligence, the General Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, contacted former Central Intelligence Agency Counterterrorism Department head Vincent Cannistraro stating that Saddam [...] "knew there was a campaign to link him to 11 September and prove he {{had weapons of mass destruction}} (WMDs)." [...] Cannistraro further added that [...] "the Iraqis were prepared to satisfy these concerns. <b>I</b> <b>reported</b> the conversation to senior levels of the state department and I was told to stand aside and they would handle it." [...] Cannistraro stated that the offers made were all [...] "killed" [...] by the George W. Bush administration because they allowed Saddam to remain in power, an outcome viewed as unacceptable. It has been suggested that Saddam Hussein was prepared to go into exile if allowed to keep $1 billion USD.|$|E

2500|$|Like Washington's Army {{after the}} winter at Valley Forge, the Confederate Army and the 19th Virginia {{emerged in the}} spring a well-drilled force to be {{reckoned}} with. [...] The regiment broke winterquarters on March 8, 1862, and marched south toward Culpeper. [...] They camped outside Warrenton, Virginia, on March 10, then at Amissville on the 12th. [...] They halted at Orange Court House on March 16. [...] The 19th had marched 100 miles over the past two weeks, minus five days of rest. [...] During the next two weeks, the 19th was drilled hard by Lieutenant Colonel Strange. [...] While at camp at Orange, new recruits arrived to the regiment. [...] Company <b>I</b> <b>reported</b> to have received 22 new recruits. [...] Private William H. Jones {{wrote in a letter to}} his wife that, [...] "camp life is a very hard life to one that is not bin(been) used to it..." [...] On April 6, the 19th moved out, marching south to Louisa. [...] They pass through Louisa Court House, on April 10, where some new recruits joined Company C. On April 16, the regiment arrived on the Richmond line for the purpose of defending the Confederate capitol against the advance of Federal Major General George B. McClellan's Army of the Potomac, which was preparing for its advance up the York Peninsula. After First Manassas, the Confederate Army of the Potomac was reorganized and renamed the Army of Northern Virginia under the command of General Joseph E. Johnston. After the suicide of General Cocke on December 26, 1861, the 19th Virginia was brigade-ed with the 8th, 18th, and 28th Virginia Infantry Regiments and the brigade was placed under the command of Brigadier General George Pickett and designated the Third Brigade of the Second Division, which was commanded by Major General James Longstreet.
