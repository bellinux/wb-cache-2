60|$|The {{institutions}} which Romulus actually founded, {{were of a}} very republican character, if {{the accounts}} of subsequent writers are to be believed. He established, it is true, a gradation of ranks, {{but the most important}} offices, civil and military, were filled, it is said, by election {{on the part of the}} people. In the first place, the whole population was divided into three portions, which were called tribes, which word was formed from the Latin word tres, meaning three. These tribes chose each three presiding officers, selecting for the purpose the oldest and most distinguished of their number. It is probable, in fact, that Romulus himself really made the selection, and that the action of the people was confined to some sort of expression of assent and concurrence, for it is difficult to imagine how any other kind of election than this could be possible among so rude and ignorant a multitude. The tribes were then subdivided each into thirty counts or counties, and each of these likewise elected its head. Thus there was a large body of magistrates or chieftains appointed, ninety-nine in number, namely, nine heads of tribes and ninety heads of counties. Romulus himself added one to the number, of his own <b>independent</b> <b>selection,</b> which made the hundredth. The men thus chosen, constituted what was called the senate. They formed the great legislative council of the nation. They and the families descending from them became, in subsequent times, an aristocratic and privileged class, called the Patricians. The remaining portion of the population were called Plebeians.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the topologies and {{functions}} of protein interaction networks requires the selective removal of single interactions. We introduce a selection strategy that enriches among a random library of alleles for mutations that impair the binding to a given partner protein. The selection makes use of a split-ubiquitin based protein interaction assay. This assay provides yeast cells that carry protein complex disturbing mutations with {{the advantage of being}} able to survive on uracil-lacking media. Applied to the exemplary interaction between the PB domains of the yeast proteins Bem 1 and Cdc 24, we performed two <b>independent</b> <b>selections.</b> The selections were either analyzed by Sanger sequencing of isolated clones or by next generation sequencing (NGS) of pools of clones. Both screens enriched for the same mutation in position 833 of Cdc 24. Biochemical analysis confirmed that this mutation disturbs the interaction with Bem 1 but not the fold of the protein. The larger dataset obtained by NGS achieved a more complete representation of the bipartite interaction interface of Cdc 24...|$|R
50|$|Both DNA and RNA aptamers show robust binding affinities {{for various}} targets. DNA and RNA aptamers have been {{selected}} for the same target. These targets include lysozyme, thrombin, human immunodeficiency virus trans-acting responsive element (HIV TAR), hemin, interferon γ, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), prostate specific antigen (PSA), dopamine, and the non-classical oncogene, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). In the case of lysozyme, HIV TAR, VEGF and dopamine the DNA aptamer is the analog of the RNA aptamer, with thymine replacing uracil. The hemin, thrombin, and interferon γ, DNA and RNA aptamers were selected through <b>independent</b> <b>selections</b> and have unique sequences. Considering that not all DNA analogs of RNA aptamers show functionality, the correlation between DNA and RNA sequence and their structure and function requires further investigation.|$|R

40|$|SummaryAbout 12, 000 {{years ago}} in the Near East, humans began the {{transition}} from hunter-gathering to agriculture-based societies. Barley was a founder crop in this process, and the most important steps in its domestication were mutations in two adjacent, dominant, and complementary genes, through which grains were retained on the inflorescence at maturity, enabling effective harvesting. Independent recessive mutations in each of these genes caused cell wall thickening in a highly specific grain “disarticulation zone,” converting the brittle floral axis (the rachis) of the wild-type into a tough, non-brittle form that promoted grain retention. By tracing the evolutionary history of allelic variation in both genes, we conclude that spatially and temporally <b>independent</b> <b>selections</b> of germplasm with a non-brittle rachis were made during the domestication of barley by farmers in the southern and northern regions of the Levant, actions that made a major contribution to the emergence of early agrarian societies...|$|R
