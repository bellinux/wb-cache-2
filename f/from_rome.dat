5|$|After {{the death}} of Tiberius’ son Drusus Julius Caesar in 23 AD, he became more reclusive and aloof. In 26 AD Tiberius removed himself <b>from</b> <b>Rome</b> and left {{administration}} largely {{in the hands of}} his unscrupulous Praetorian prefects Lucius Aelius Sejanus and Quintus Naevius Sutorius Macro.|$|E
5|$|At any rate, the {{uprising}} was strictly confined to Saturninus' province, and quickly detected once the rumour {{spread across the}} neighbouring provinces. The governor of Germania Inferior, Aulus Bucius Lappius Maximus, moved to the region at once, assisted by the procurator of Rhaetia, Titus Flavius Norbanus. From Spain, Trajan was summoned, while Domitian himself came <b>from</b> <b>Rome</b> with the Praetorian Guard.|$|E
5|$|By the 4th century BC, the {{military}} formations the Romans had {{inherited from the}} Etruscans were still in use. Though their efficiency was doubtful, they proved effective against Rome's largely local adversaries. When Gauls invaded Etruria in 390 BC, the inhabitants requested help <b>from</b> <b>Rome.</b> The small contingent Rome sent to repel the Gallic invaders provoked a full-scale attack on Rome and the entire Roman army was destroyed at the Battle of the Allia.|$|E

5|$|De Mauro {{was kidnapped}} {{on the evening}} of September 16, 1970, while coming back home from work, in the via delle Magnolie in Palermo. Thousands of police and Carabinieri with {{helicopters}} and dogs combed Sicily in vain in search of the reporter. De Mauro’s body has never been found, a victim of the so-called lupara bianca, despite intensive search efforts by Palermo police assisted by top-level forces <b>from</b> <b>Rome</b> and even a special investigative committee of the Italian Parliament.|$|E
5|$|During Tiberius' reign Jews {{had become}} more {{prominent}} in Rome and Jewish and Gentile followers of Jesus began proselytizing Roman citizens, increasing long-simmering resentments. Tiberius in 19 AD ordered Jews who were of military age to join the Roman Army. Tiberius banished {{the rest of the}} Jews <b>from</b> <b>Rome</b> and threatened to enslave them for life if they did not leave the city.|$|E
5|$|Equally curtailed by Mucianus were Domitian's {{military}} ambitions. The {{civil war}} of 69 had severely destabilized the provinces, leading to several local uprisings {{such as the}} Batavian revolt in Gaul. Batavian auxiliaries of the Rhine legions, led by Gaius Julius Civilis, had rebelled {{with the aid of}} a faction of Treveri under the command of Julius Classicus. Seven legions were sent <b>from</b> <b>Rome,</b> led by Vespasian's brother-in-law Quintus Petillius Cerialis.|$|E

5|$|Historian Michael Crawford {{attributes}} {{the disappearance of}} much of Tiberius Gracchus' support to the reduced level of citizen participation due to dispersal far <b>from</b> <b>Rome,</b> and sees his tribunate as marking {{a step in the}} Hellenization of Roman aristocracy. Crawford asserts that Gaius Gracchus' extortion law shifted {{the balance of power in}} Rome and that the Gracchi made available a new political armoury which the oligarchy subsequently sought to exploit.|$|E
5|$|In 1806, the Italian Republic was {{replaced}} by the Kingdom of Italy with Napoleon as its emperor. By 1812, all of Italy <b>from</b> <b>Rome</b> northwards was under the control of Napoleon, either as French Departments or as part of the Kingdom of Italy ensuring the metric system was in use throughout this region.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} his life, Caesar {{began to}} prepare for a war against the Parthian Empire. Since his absence <b>from</b> <b>Rome</b> would limit his ability to install his own consuls, he passed a law which allowed him to appoint all magistrates in 43 BC, and all consuls and tribunes in 42 BC. This {{transformed}} the magistrates from representatives of the people to representatives of the dictator.|$|E

5|$|Paulinus was a monk <b>from</b> <b>Rome</b> {{sent to the}} Kingdom of Kent by Pope Gregory I in 601, {{along with}} Mellitus and others, {{as part of the}} second group of missionaries sent to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity. He was {{probably}} an Italian by birth. The second group of missionaries arrived in Kent by 604, but little is known of Paulinus' further activities until he went to Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|Sejanus's {{position}} {{was not quite}} that of successor; he had requested marriage in AD25 to Tiberius's niece, Livilla, though under pressure quickly withdrew the request. While Sejanus's Praetorians controlled the imperial post, and therefore the information that Tiberius received <b>from</b> <b>Rome</b> and the information Rome received from Tiberius, the presence of Livia seems to have checked his overt power for a time. Her death in AD29 changed all that.|$|E
5|$|The Annals by Tacitus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{detailed}} accounts of Germanicus' campaigns against the Germans. He wrote his account in the early years of the second century.

5|$|The Indians {{were present}} in Alexandria and the Christian and Jewish {{settlers}} <b>from</b> <b>Rome</b> continued to live in India long {{after the fall of}} the Roman empire, which resulted in Rome's loss of the Red Sea ports, previously used to secure trade with India by the Greco-Roman world since the time of the Ptolemaic dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Drusus {{elevated}} Sejanus, {{at least in}} Tiberius's eyes, who thereafter refers to him as his 'Socius Laborum' (Partner of my labours). Tiberius had statues of Sejanus erected throughout the city, and Sejanus {{became more and more}} visible as Tiberius began to withdraw <b>from</b> <b>Rome</b> altogether. Finally, with Tiberius's withdrawal in AD26, Sejanus was left in charge of the entire state mechanism and the city of Rome.|$|E
5|$|This {{military}} operation {{had a major}} political role, since {{the leaders of the}} government, including King Vittorio Emanuele III and his family, and Prime Minister Badoglio, fled <b>from</b> <b>Rome</b> to Brindisi after the surrender. Brindisi at the time was controlled only by the Italian Army, but its quick occupation by British troops secured the safety of the Italian leaders and allowed the declaration of war by Italy against Germany.|$|E
