5|$|A three-strong EC <b>delegation</b> {{made three}} {{visits to the}} region in late June and early July to {{negotiate}} a political agreement which would facilitate further negotiations. The <b>delegation</b> consisted of the foreign ministers of Luxembourg, as the incumbent holder of the EC presidency, and Italy and the Netherlands, as the previous and future holders of that office. The <b>delegation</b> members were Jacques Poos (Luxembourg), Gianni de Michelis (Italy), and Hans van den Broek (Netherlands). Prior to the delegation's arrival in Belgrade, Poos told reporters that the EC would {{take charge of the}} crisis. There, the <b>delegation</b> was met by Serbian president Slobodan Milošević who dismissed the prospect of Croatia leaving the Yugoslav federation because its population contained 600,000 Serbs.|$|E
5|$|Aruba is a {{small island}} colony of 100,000 people {{that is part of}} the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and has been under Dutch control since the 1630s. The island lies in the {{southern}} Caribbean Sea just to north of Venezuela, and is near to the Dutch colonies of Curaçao and Bonaire. The colony originally was part of an autonomous union with those two islands in what was known as the Netherlands Antilles, but Aruba seceded from that union in 1986. The Netherlands continues to regulate all its foreign affairs. While the first Dutch Antilean <b>delegation</b> to the Olympics was sent during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, the first uniquely Aruban <b>delegation</b> participated two years after the island's secession from the Netherlands Antilles at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Between then and the 2004 Athens Olympics, Aruba had sent a <b>delegation</b> to all five Summer Olympic games. The most substantial Aruban <b>delegation</b> was in 1988, when it included eight athletes. This <b>delegation</b> included more women and encompassed more sports than any Aruban <b>delegation</b> since then (including the Athens Olympics).|$|E
5|$|Dominica is {{an island}} nation located in the far eastern rim of the Caribbean Sea that lis between the French colonies of Guadeloupe (to the north) and Martinique to the south. The country's debut in the Olympics was in Atlanta during the 1996 Summer Olympics, and it has participated in every summer Olympics between then and the Beijing Olympics in 2008numbering four in total. The largest <b>delegation</b> sent by Dominica was in 1996, {{and the size of}} its <b>delegation</b> {{decreased}} to four in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, then to two in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Dominica's Beijing <b>delegation</b> also only included two athletes, although its appearance at the Olympics marked the first Dominican <b>delegation</b> that included no women. As of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, Dominican athletes had not won any medals. Jerome Romain, the coach accompanying the Dominican <b>delegation,</b> was the nation's flagbearer at the ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|A {{vote was}} taken {{after a long}} day of speeches, each colony casting a single vote, as always. The <b>delegation</b> for each colony {{numbered}} from two to seven members, and each <b>delegation</b> voted amongst themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York <b>delegation</b> abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the <b>delegation</b> was split between Thomas McKean (who voted yes) and George Read (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations voted in favor of independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The next step was for the resolution to be voted upon by Congress itself. Edward Rutledge of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of unanimity, and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.|$|E

40|$|Five {{years after}} the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon {{and at the end}} of the first mandate of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission (HR/VP), this {{analysis}} provides an in-depth view of the on-going institutional socialisation between Member State Embassies and EU <b>Delegations.</b> Specifically, it focuses on the Member States’ perceptions of the role of EU <b>Delegations.</b> These perceptions can back up or restrain the EU <b>Delegations</b> in fulfilling their mandate. More precisely, the paper examines to what extent the socialisation between EU <b>Delegations</b> and EU Member State Embassies helps the <b>Delegations</b> to fulfil their mandate in bilateral diplomacy. It argues that EU <b>Delegations</b> are still under dynamic processes of institutional socialisation with the Member States’ Embassies which increasingly accept and expect EU Delegations’ actions. The post-Lisbon context of EU Diplomacy is consolidating a primus inter pares role of <b>Delegations</b> being central hubs coordinating and implementing EU policies on the spot...|$|R
5|$|Before Beijing, the Bahamas {{had participated}} in the Summer Olympics {{thirteen}} times.

The Bahamian <b>delegation</b> in Beijing included twenty-five athletes, one of its largest delegations in its history up to that point.

40|$|A {{prominent}} {{criticism of}} U. S. <b>delegations</b> to international institutions – or international <b>delegations</b> – focuses on agency costs. The criticism begins by drawing {{a stark contrast}} between international <b>delegations</b> and domestic <b>delegations.</b> For domestic <b>delegations</b> to agencies, U. S. congressional, executive and judicial oversight mechanisms are present to try and maintain the agency’s democratic accountability. Since the agency is democratically accountable, the agency costs are low. For international <b>delegations</b> of binding authority to international institutions, however, {{the conventional wisdom is}} that oversight mechanisms are absent and the U. S. cannot monitor the international institution to ensure it acts within its delegated authority. In the international context, agency costs are high. The fear of high agency costs through the loss of democratic accountability, so the argument goes, justifies constitutionally inspired limits on international <b>delegations.</b> This Article challenges the conventional wisdom. It argues that the agency costs claim rests on weak foundations as agency costs will likely vary depending on the type, scope, and nature of the delegation; that the U. S. has actually implemented many of the domestic oversight tools in the international context, ensuring a surprisingly high level of accountability to American interests; and that the potential costs and benefits of international <b>delegations</b> are not meaningfully different from those in domestic <b>delegations.</b> In other words, there is little systematic difference between domestic and international <b>delegations</b> with respect to the efficacy of oversight mechanisms or the balance of costs and benefits. The Article concludes that constitutionally inspired limits on binding international <b>delegations</b> are probably unnecessary because they will increase the costs for the U. S. to participate in potentially beneficial international cooperation...|$|R
