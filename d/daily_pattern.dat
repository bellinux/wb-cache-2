25|$|Malaita's {{climate is}} {{extremely}} wet. It {{is located in}} the Intertropical Convergence Zone ("Doldrums"), with its fickle weather patterns. The sun is at zenith over Malaita, and thus the effect is most pronounced, in November and February. Trade winds come during the southern hemisphere's winter, and from about April to August they blow from the southeast fairly steadily. During the summer, fringes of monsoon blow over the island. Because of the surrounding sea, air temperatures are fairly consistent, with a difference between daily highs and lows averaging to 13.6°F However, across the year, the difference is much less; the mean daily temperature in the warmest month is only 3.4°F warmer than that of the coolest. Rainfall is heavy and there is constant high humidity. The most common <b>daily</b> <b>pattern</b> follows an adiabatic process, with a calm, clear morning, followed by a breeze blowing in from higher pressures over the sea, culminating in a cloudy and drizzly afternoon. At night, the weather pattern reverses, and drizzle and heavy dew dissipate the cloud cover for the morning. Tropical cyclones are the only violent weather, but they can be destructive.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} and initial validation {{results of a}} micro-simulator for the generation of <b>daily</b> activity-travel <b>patterns</b> are presented in this paper. The simulator assumes a sequential history and time-of-day dependent structure.

Each of the model components is relatively simple and is estimated using commonly adopted estimation methods and existing data sets. A computer code has been developed and <b>daily</b> travel <b>patterns</b> have been generated by Monte Carlo simulation.

50|$|Designing {{lighting}} for {{the elderly}} requires special consideration and care from architects and lighting designers. As people age, they experience neurodegeneration in the retina and in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Less light reaches {{the back of the}} eyes because the pupils decrease in size as you age, the lens inside your eye becomes thicker, and the lens scatters more light, causing objects and colors to appear less vivid. These symptoms are particularly common with persons having alzheimer's disease. Older people also have reduced levels of retinal illuminance, such as having smaller pupils and less transparent crystalline lenses. Furthermore, as an individual ages, he or she begins to lose retinal neurons, which not only compromises the ability to see but also to register a robust <b>daily</b> <b>pattern</b> of light-dark that is needed to maintain biological rhythms. The 24-hour light-dark cycle is the most important external stimulus for regulating the timing of the circadian cycle.|$|E

Similarly, the Bryn Mawr College plan took into consideration the landmark of the early campus and the usages of campus space prior to planning.Scott Brown holds a systematic approach to planning in what is coined as “FFF studios.” In it, form, forces and function determine and help define the urban environment. For example, the Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates firm studied both the expansion of Dartmouth College campus along with the wilderness surrounding the perimeter of the area.|$|E
50|$|Under normal summertime conditions, a <b>daily</b> <b>pattern</b> of fog and {{low clouds}} occurs. Morning sun heats the ground {{which in turn}} heats the marine layer over the land areas. This creates {{convective}} turbulence within the marine layer as well as evaporation of any clouds within it. The marine layer clears back toward the coast, usually by noon. By mid-afternoon, inland areas have heated sufficiently to decrease the air pressure and increase the onshore flow. By late afternoon, the wind increases and begins to cool the onshore marine layer, allowing the fog and low clouds offshore to progress inland without evaporating. Cloudiness streams in over the Bay and through the various gaps. How far the clouds can penetrate inland depends on {{the depth of the}} marine layer and the strength of the cooling winds. As night falls and inland areas cool down, the winds usually decrease, but the fog and clouds remain wherever they have blown in until the following morning when the cycle repeats.|$|E

Time series of stem radius fluctuations using point dendrometers can provide information about radial stem growth and tree water relations with unprecedented quality and high temporal resolution. It is well known that climatic drivers such as the evaporative demand or water availability exert a strong control over the <b>daily</b> fluctuation <b>patterns.</b> The extent of within-species variations and the interaction with the environment remains however poorly documented. Here, we present stem radius fluctuations among eight 3 -year-old Populus deltoides × Populus nigra genotypes grown in a common garden under two distinct water regimes. <b>Daily</b> <b>patterns</b> were analysed for one growing season. From <b>daily</b> <b>patterns,</b> we extracted the maximum daily shrinkage (MDS) which is mostly related to the capacitive discharge of outer bark elastic tissues and the day-to-day difference in stem radius over time (dR) which is mostly related to cambial growth. The duration of each daily cycle and individual phase (stem contraction, stem expansion and stem radius increment) were also estimated. Differences among genotypes, genotype × drought interactions, and relationships with other aspects of tree water/carbon relations such as xylem vulnerability to cavitation, growth and water-use efficiency will be presented and discussed in line with potential implications for poplar cultivation...|$|R

We quantified the effects of land use (broad-leaved forest, mixed coniferous/broad-leaved forest, natural grassland, subalpine vegetation, forestry area, and agricultural land), along with hunting pressure, and densities of feral domestic dogs and wild macaques on deer. The effects of land use were analyzed at various spatial scales and a model selection procedure (generalized mixed model) {{was used to examine}} the effects of factors on density and <b>daily</b> activity <b>pattern</b> of deer at each spatial scale.

For the <b>daily</b> activity <b>pattern</b> of deer, agricultural land, forestry area, natural grassland, subalpine vegetation and dog density reduced diurnal and increased nocturnal activity.
