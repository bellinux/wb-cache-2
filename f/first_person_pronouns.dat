500|$|Hamasaki's lyrics, all her own, have {{resonated}} {{among her}} fans, who praise {{them as being}} honest and heartfelt and [...] "expressing determination"; in two surveys conducted by Oricon, respondents voted Hamasaki's lyrics as their favorite aspect of her artistry. Steve McClure of The Japan Times noted that Hamasaki has [...] "developed {{a reputation as a}} thoughtful, introspective lyricist"; Barry Walters of The Village Voice comments that Hamasaki's lyrics [...] "pack unlikely insights". Having [...] "trouble voicing her thoughts", Hamasaki uses her lyrics as an outlet; she draws inspiration from her own (and occasionally her friends') experiences and emotions and tries to put them [...] "honestly into words". She has stated that honesty is essential to her lyrics, saying, [...] "If I write when I'm low, it will be a dark song, but I don't care. I want to be honest with myself at all times." [...] This meant that she did not use English lyrics until her album Rainbow, as she felt that she could best express herself in Japanese. As with her musical style, the themes of her lyrics have varied. Her debut album A Song for ×× dealt mostly with themes of [...] "loneliness and confusion", as did her second album Loveppears. Duty likewise expressed feelings of disappointment and confusion. Hamasaki began to take on a more global outlook with her following albums I Am... and Rainbow, branching out to wider themes such as faith and peace. Music critic Tetsu Misaki noted a large change in her lyrics style between her debut album A Song for ×× (1999), which mostly dealt with personal problems, and her following albums Loveppears and Duty. Misaki believed Hamasaki had begun thinking about her influence on society more, and began writing songs with important messages she wanted to express to her listeners. This was signalled by her not using <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>pronouns</b> as much, and instead using the words [...] and [...] more often. As Hamasaki matured, her lyrics began to express more confidence; themes in her later albums included love and the struggles of women. With Guilty, Hamasaki began to compose her lyrics not only as an exposition of her personal feelings but as encouragements for her listeners, an outlook she applied in Next Level as well. In songs such as [...] "Talkin' 2 Myself" [...] and [...] "Mirrorcle World", Hamasaki deals with the [...] "awareness and fighting spirit of surviving in a high-risk age" [...] to encourage listeners; in [...] "Rollin'" [...] (from Next Level), Hamasaki writes, [...] "The age is rolling around/At the speed of heading toward the end/Beyond the border/Disappointment and hope fight with each other". In addition to personal experiences and feelings, Hamasaki bases lyrics on sources such as historical events. The life of Joan of Arc was the inspiration for [...] "Free & Easy", while a story told to her by her friend about a saint named Mary served as the basis for [...] "M"; the September 11 attacks inspired [...] "A Song Is Born".|$|E

50|$|Some proforms lack a {{linguistic}} antecedent (or postcedent). In such cases, the antecedent is {{implied in the}} given discourse environment or from general knowledge of the world. For instance, the <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>pronouns</b> I, me, we, and us and second person pronoun you are proforms that usually lack {{a linguistic}} antecedent. However, their antecedents {{are present in the}} discourse context as the speaker and the listener. Pleonastic proforms also lack a linguistic antecedent, e.g. It is raining, where the pronoun it is semantically empty and cannot be viewed as referring to anything specific in the discourse world. Definite proforms such as they and you also have an indefinite use, which means they denote some person or people in general, e.g. They will get you for that, and therefore cannot be construed as taking a linguistic antecedent.|$|E
50|$|Rajasthani {{belongs to}} the {{languages}} that mix three types of case marking systems: nominative - accusative: transitive (A) and intransitive (S) subjects have similar case marking, {{different from that of}} transitive object (O); absolutive-ergative (S and O have similar marking, different from A), tripartite (A, S and O have different case marking). There is a general tendency existing in the languages with split nominal systems: the split is usually conditioned by the referents of the core NPs, the probability of ergative marking increasing from left to right in the following nominal hierarchy: <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>pronouns</b> - second person pronouns - demonstratives and third person pronouns - proper nouns - common nouns (human - animate - inanimate). Rajasthani split case marking system partially follows this hierarchy:first and second person pronouns have similar A and S marking, the other pronouns and singular nouns are showing attrition of A/S opposition.|$|E
5000|$|One {{character}} speaks at a {{time and}} only when a strong spotlight shines in his or her face. The style is reminiscent of Mouth’s logorrhoea http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/logorrhea%20 in Not I, the obvious difference being that these characters constantly use <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>pronouns.</b> Clichés and puns abound. While one is talking the other two are silent and in darkness. They neither acknowledge the existence of the others around them (M: “To think we were never together”) nor appear aware of anything outside their own being and past (W2: “At the same time I prefer this to [...] [...] [...] the other thing. Definitely. There are endurable moments”). Beckett writes that this spotlight [...] "provokes" [...] the character's speech, and insists that whenever possible, a single, swivelling light should be used, rather than separate lights switching on and off. In this manner the spotlight is “expressive of a unique inquisitor”. Billie Whitelaw referred to it as “an instrument of torture.” The spotlight is in effect the play’s fourth character.|$|E
50|$|Agreement between pronoun (or {{corresponding}} possessive adjective) and antecedent {{also requires}} {{the selection of}} the correct person.

50|$|Both self-talk, the {{propensity}} {{to engage in}} verbal or mental self-directed conversation and thought, and social support {{can be used as}} instruments of self-improvement, often by empowering, action-promoting messages. Psychologists have designed series of experiments that are intended to shed light into how self-talk can result in self-improvement. In general, research has shown that people prefer to use second person pronouns over <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>pronouns</b> when engaging in self-talk to achieve goals, regulate one’s own behavior, thoughts, or emotions, and facilitate performance. If self-talk has the expected effect, then writing about personal problems using language from their friends’ perspective should result in greater amount of motivational and emotional benefits comparing to using language from their own perspective. When you need to finish a difficult task and you are not willing to do something to finish this task, trying to write a few sentence or goals imaging what your friends have told you gives you more motivational resources comparing to you write to yourself. Research done by Ireland and others have revealed that, as expected, when people are writing using many physical and mental words or even typing a standard prompt with these kinds of words, adopting a friend’s perspective while freely writing about a personal challenge can help increase people’s intention to improve self-control by promoting the positivity of emotions such as pride and satisfaction, which can motivate people to reach their goal.|$|E

Misaki believed Hamasaki had begun thinking about her influence on society more, and began writing songs with important messages she wanted to express to her listeners. This was signalled by her not using <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>pronouns</b> as much, and instead using the words bokura ("we") and tsutaeru ("convey") more often.

Though Max Matsuura is officially credited as the producer of her records, he said of Hamasaki, [...] "Ayu is a very meticulous worker behind the scenes. A lot of the work she does by herself is more in the producers arena. I think really we should say Produced by Ayumi Hamasaki." [...] Until her single [...] "M", however, Hamasaki left the task of composing to her staff; as she has explained, [...] "Im not a professional; I lack even basic knowledge about writing music." [...] However, she started to compose her own melodies after her staff had failed to compose a tune for [...] "M" [...] that appealed to her. Wanting to produce works faithful to her visions, Hamasaki took control of most aspects of her artistry. I Am... is representative of this stage in Hamasakis career; she directed the production of its songs, videos, and artwork. She began to compose less after I Am...: whereas nearly all of I Am... was her work, only nine of Rainbows fifteen tracks were composed by her. She was even less involved in the composition of subsequent albums, composing two tracks on Memorial Address, three on My Story, and one on (Miss)understood; since Secret, none of the songs on her studio albums have listed her as a composer. With later albums, Hamasaki also began to delegate to her staff tasks she had once handled herself. Hamasaki cites Madonna, soul musicians Babyface and En Vogue, and rock bands Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple as her influences and states that she admires Michelle Branch, Kid Rock, Joan Osborne, Seiko Matsuda, Rie Miyazawa, and Keiko Yamada; these diverse influences have led to the variety of her own music. Hamasaki began commissioning remixes of her songs early in her career, and this practice also influenced the diversity of her music. Found on many of her records, these remixes span different genres of electronic dance music including Eurobeat, house, and trance, as well as acoustic genres such as classical and traditional Chinese music. She has employed Western as well as Japanese musicians; among those she has worked with are Above & Beyond, the Lamoureux Orchestra of France, and traditional Chinese music ensemble Princess China Music Orchestra. Hamasaki has released more than a hundred original songs; through them, she has covered a wide range of musical styles, such as dance, metal, R&B, progressive rock, pop, and classical. She uses different instruments and techniques including piano, orchestra, gospel choirs, guitars, traditional Japanese strings, music boxes, and effects such as yells, claps, and scratching.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—There are {{different}} approaches that study {{the representation of}} identity and interaction in scientific research articles. Compared to English-speaking countries, German scholars hold different opinions on whether <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>pronouns</b> {{should be used in}} academic writing. In this paper, the author tried to address the construction of writers ’ identity in German academic writing through a corpus-based analysis. Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze the corpus, the author found out that the occurrences of <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>pronouns</b> in the German corpus are much lower than in the English academic articles. The feature of the German academic writing to avoid the use of <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>pronouns</b> shows the impersonal style of German academic writing. This feature has its own cultural and historic backgrounds and should be respected.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore writer identity in Mexican undergraduate students of Applied Linguistics writing in English. We focused on the participants' use of <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>pronouns</b> and the ways in which they conceptualized their identity as authors of their essays. We employed a combination of text analysis and discourse-based interview methodologies. Findings indicate that participants that made ample use of <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>pronouns</b> employed them to present personal experiences rather than to project a strong authorial self. By contrast, those who made little use of <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>pronouns</b> seemed to project stronger authorial selves by employing a broader range of stylistic choices. The use of <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>pronouns</b> is not essential in the development of strong authorial selves.

30|$|Moreover, {{the study}} of expressing {{emotions}} through written words (i.e., micro-level analysis) has demonstrated that, although almost without meaning by their own, the way people use ‘function words’ such as pronouns (e.g., I, we, you, they) is significantly related to mental and physical health, {{as well as other}} important outcomes such as academic success. For example, <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>pronouns</b> (e.g., I) are most common among depressed individuals (Campbell and Pennebaker 2003; Pennebaker 1997, 2011). Hence, this suggests that the usage of <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>pronouns</b> in narratives of life events should be negatively correlated with an individual’s agentic (i.e., self-directedness), communal (i.e., cooperativeness), and spiritual traits (i.e., self-transcendence).|$|E

Thirty research articles (fifteen articles belonging to native and fifteen belonging to non-native English speaking writers) were selected from leading (Iranian and International) journals of Chemistry and the use of <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>pronouns</b> were analyzed. The analysis shows that the overall distribution of <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>pronouns</b> in non-native English speaking articles is higher than that in native English speaking writings. These findings are consistent with the findings of Petch-Tyson (1998) and Cobb (2003) who found that non-native English speaking writing contains far more personal involvement than similar native English speaking writing...|$|E
