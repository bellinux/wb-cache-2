40|$|Wind tunnel {{experiments}} at German Aerospace Center (DLR) for {{the analysis}} of laminar turbulent transition showed that a nearly linearly decreasing pressure distribution at a plate is able to suppress Tollmien-Schlichting boundary layer instabilities. Nevertheless, this pressure distribution leads to the growth of nonlinear instabilities in cross flow direction. Within up-ucoming research projects at DLR it is intended to further investigate this cross flow boundary layer instabilities. The experimental setup consists of a flat plate, a <b>displacement</b> <b>body</b> mounted above the plate and an additional supporting wing. The supporting wing prevents flow separations. The <b>displacement</b> <b>body</b> imposes the particular pressure distribution upon the upper side of the plate. However, contour and position of the <b>displacement</b> <b>body</b> is not known by detail. Therefore, the given pressure distribution is to be recreated by an inverse design procedure. The task {{can be seen as a}} design optimisation to a given pressure function. To provide a fast evaluation the discrete adjoint method of the TAU-Code is used.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the analytical method}} and numerical {{procedure for the calculation}} of the wave pressure distribution and resulting induced forces and moments acting on large <b>displacement</b> <b>bodies</b> in the sea. The added mass and damping coefficients for the structure oscillating in all six degrees of freedom is computed. Then, the hydrodynamic coefficients associated with both the wave/structure interaction and the oscillation of the structure are determined by use of a Green's function method using quadralateral elements of constant source strength which applies to large structures of rather general shape. The analysis is based on linear theory and viscous effects are neglected on the basis that the size of the structure is large in relation to the amplitude of the incident wave. Also, the equations of motion for a free-floating body are developed which yields the dynamic response of a floating body with linear mooring line forces. Finally, the computer program capable of carrying out the numerical calculations is outlined and the input/output is discussed in some detail.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} {{the influence of}} the spatial frequency content of roughness distributions on the development of crossflow instabilities has been carried out. From previous research it is known that micro roughness elements can have a large influence on the crossflow development. When the spanwise spacing is chosen such that it is the most unstable wavelength (following linear stability analysis), stationary crossflow waves are amplified. While in earlier studies the focus was on the height or spanwise spacing of roughness elements, in the present study it is chosen to vary the shape of the elements. Through the modification of the shape the forcing at the critical wavelength is increased, while the forcing at the harmonics of the critical wavelength is damped. Experiments were carried in the low turbulence wind tunnel at City University London (Tu= 0. 006 %) on a swept flat plate in combination with <b>displacement</b> <b>bodies</b> to create a sufficiently strong favourable pressure gradient. Hot wire measurements across the plate tracked the development of stationary and travelling crossflow waves. Initially, stronger crossflow waves were found for the elements with stronger forcing, while further downstream the effect of forcing diminished. Spatial frequency spectra showed that the stronger forcing at the critical wavelength (via the roughness shape) dominates the response of the flow while low forcing at the harmonics has no notable effect. Additionally, high resolution streamwise hot wire scans showed that the onset of secondary instability is not significantly influenced by the spatial frequency content of the roughness distribution...|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{predicting}} the strong {{interaction between the}} viscous and inviscid flows which occurs in flow separation is reviewed. An inverse boundary-layer procedure approximately accounts for normal pressure gradients that may be important in strongly interacting flows. Transformed boundary-layer equations are written in which the pressure gradient is set equal to the inviscid pressure gradient. As the boundary-layer edge is approached and the viscous shear and heat conduction terms vanish, the viscous flow solution is required to asymptotically approach the inviscid solution over the generalized <b>displacement</b> <b>body.</b> Attention is then focused on viscous-inviscid interacting flows with a first-order viscous formulation and constant pressure across the boundary layer.

Two principal conclusions are that delta T sub c is a valid crack tip parameter during nonsteady as well as steady state creep and that delta T sub c has an energy rate interpretation whereas C* does not.

30|$|In {{inviscid}} flow, {{there is}} no boundary layer and the flow is everywhere tangent to the body surface, which may therefore be represented by a streamline. In viscous flow, however, the no-slip condition states that the fluid at the body surface has zero relative velocity, resulting in {{a reduction in the}} flow rate around the body. Two methods of modelling this reduction in flow rate, first described by Lighthill [4], are by a normal displacement of the inviscid surface streamline by a small distance, known as the boundary layer displacement thickness, δ*, or by the addition of a transpiration velocity at the real body surface, which approximates the effective <b>displacement</b> <b>body</b> surface. For flows with more severe separation, the free shear layers bounding the separated wake are modelled as a pair of free vortex sheets [5], the geometries of which are iteratively determined according to the induced velocities. This is commonly referred to as the ‘double wake’ method.|$|R
