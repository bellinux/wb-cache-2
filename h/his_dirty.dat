5|$|Athens' local country {{scene has}} never been as {{significant}} as the profusion of indie rock bands; however, modern Athens rock takes many elements from the folk, bluegrass and country traditions, including such bands as the Normaltown Flyers. The band Drive-By Truckers, and the , have done much {{in recent years to}} make country rock a major part of Athens' musical identity. Recent bands such as The Broken String Band have emerged influenced by the folk rock genre. The rapper Bubba Sparxxx, originally from South Georgia, has also helped diversify Athens' country heritage, by adding a rural image and elements of country music to <b>his</b> <b>Dirty</b> South style of hip hop music.|$|E
5|$|In December 1994, Alan Parker {{signed on}} to write and direct the film after being {{approached}} by Stigwood and Vajna. Parker also produced the film, with <b>his</b> <b>Dirty</b> Hands Productions banner enlisted as a production company. While drafting his own script, Parker researched Eva's life, compiling newspaper articles, documentaries and English-language books. He refused to borrow elements from Stone's script or the stage play, instead opting to model his script after Rice and Lloyd Webber's concept album. Stone had a falling out with Parker over {{the content of the}} script, claiming that he had made significant contributions. A legal dispute and arbitration by the Writers Guild of America resulted in Parker and Stone sharing a screenwriting credit.|$|E
5|$|Orochimaru, however, craved {{more power}} than could be {{obtained}} from training with his master, and began abducting villagers of Konohagakure for various experiments with Yamato among his surviving victims. Unwilling to bring himself to harm Orochimaru upon learning of his actions, Hiruzen allowed his former pupil to escape and flee the village. In time Orochimaru joined the criminal organization Akatsuki and became partners with a fellow Rogue Ninja named Sasori. However, after his attempt to steal the body of Itachi Uchiha through a forbidden jutsu so as to gain the Sharingan failed, Orochimaru is forced to leave the Akatsuki. Orochimaru then founded his own ninja village, Otogakure, populated with ninja loyal to him who mostly serve as test subjects in his experimentation to become an ultimate being and as pawns to do <b>his</b> <b>dirty</b> work.|$|E

25|$|Initially, Phil was calmer than Grant {{but both}} {{brothers}} {{had a sense}} of physical danger, displaying stereotypical masculinity, thuggish behaviour and a tendency to resolve problems through violence. Phil was originally depicted as the thinker and the more streetwise of the pair, often bailing his more spontaneous brother out of trouble, although later plotlines drove the character down a darker, more destructive route. Phil can be very violent, but unlike Grant, he occasionally showed restraint when dealing with various enemies encountered – exacting revenge over time, using mind games or getting others to do <b>his</b> <b>dirty</b> work, amongst other things.|$|E

25|$|Sackville {{was also}} {{disappointed}} when Lord Wilmington the late Prime Minister (d. 1743) declined {{to leave him}} his Sussex estates, worth £3-£4,000 a year. It is not clear if Wilmington's decision was made because of Sackville's messy private life, or his political inconstancy. He was also a coward, and refused to join the Guards when sent abroad. Finally, he was committed to a private lunatic asylum circa 1746, then sent abroad to exile on a very small allowance in Lausanne where Lord Shelburne met him in 1760, and commented on <b>his</b> <b>dirty</b> condition but lucid conversation.|$|E
25|$|Although cleverer {{than the}} Prince, Baldrick, knowing {{his place in}} the medieval pecking-order, holds him in awe. He often leads cheers in the Prince's honour (along with Lord Percy, who tries hard to join in), fills his head with illusions of grandeur, and often ends up doing <b>his</b> <b>dirty</b> work. This {{included}} carrying the decapitated body of Richard III and sleeping with the Spanish Infanta, Edmund's fiancée, making her unchaste in hopes that this would prevent the marriage. The latter task resulted in several injuries, including a seriously blackened eye. When Baldrick is abandoned by Edmund in the final episode, a tear falls from his eye.|$|E

Greenlee and Leo would eventually make love, but both insist that it did not mean anything and they go back to their pursuit of Ryan and Becca.

500|$|The film {{employs a}} number of {{negative}} stereotypes of Jews as being materialistic, immoral, cunning, untrustworthy and physically unattractive.

However, many old photographs show that pasties were wrapped in bags made of paper or muslin and were eaten from end-to-end; according to the earliest Cornish recipe book, published in 1929, this is [...] "the true Cornish way" [...] to eat a pasty. Another theory suggests that pasties were marked at one end with an initial and then eaten from the other end so that if not finished in one go, they could easily be reclaimed by their owners.|$|E
500|$|Cyrus invited Brett Ratner, {{director}} of the [...] "7 Things" [...] music video, to her home {{to tell him how}} much the song meant to her and what it was about. After proposing numerous ideas to each other, they decided to make the video [...] "simple with a white backdrop". Cyrus said that neither she nor Ratner wanted the video to be [...] "all about [...] " [...] because the song's message was universal; [...] "almost every girl in America could say they hate their ex or current boyfriend," [...] claimed Cyrus. As a result, the video features numerous adolescent girls including actresses Nicola Peltz, Liana Liberato, and Maiara Walsh. During the planning session, Cyrus showed Ratner a collection of personal items her ex had given her, such as photographs and <b>his</b> <b>dirty</b> socks, which she had stowed away beneath her bed. They decided to include some of these items as props in the music video. For example, the necklace Cyrus wears in the video was her ex-boyfriend's medical identification tag, which he received because of his diabetes mellitus.|$|E

The clone, who has blonde hair instead of brown, has a sadistic worldview and hides the real Mark in his closet. The {{following}} day, Twayne Boneraper hires a new assistant named Tad to do <b>his</b> <b>dirty</b> work. Tad's first action is to reassign Callie, whom he thinks is a saboteur, to a useless department in sub-basement 37. Tad also cuts Mark's department's budget by 80%, but is rather impressed by the Clone Mark's attitude. The next day at his group therapy session with Mark's students, Clone Mark turns it into a fight club to train them for the bowling tournament. Later, Clone Mark finds Callie's diary at her apartment and finds out that she plans to murder him after the tournament and then get the real Mark back. Infuriated, he decides to murder Tad and frames Callie for the crime by using a trident from her apartment as the weapon and leaving it at the scene.

500|$|The video {{opens with}} two men {{watching}} a rush in the screening rooms of a Hollywood studio. On the screen, an actress played by Madonna sings and dances to [...] "Material Girl", dressed like Monroe from [...] "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend". One of the men, played by Carradine, is a director or a producer and is immensely rich. He {{falls in love with}} the actress and wants to express his passion for her. He tells his employee, played by Wuhl: [...] "She's [...] fantastic. She could become a star." [...] The employee answered: [...] "She could be. She could be great. She could be a major star." [...] The former then concludes by saying: [...] "She is a star, George." [...] Madonna is in a pink strapless gown and has her hair in blond locks ala Monroe. The background is a reconstruction of the Monroe video, complete with staircase, chandeliers and a number of tuxedo clad chorus boys. Madonna dances and sings the song, while she is showered with cash, expensive jewellery, furs and is carried by the men over the stairs. At one time, she alludes herself from the men, by dismissing them with her fan. As the producer tries to impress Madonna, he comes to know that she does not like material things, but rather prefers simple romance. He pretends to be penniless, and brings her hand-cut flowers while paying a poor man a large amount to borrow (or possibly buy) <b>his</b> <b>dirty</b> truck to take her on a date. His plan seems to work, because the final scene shows him and Madonna kissing in the truck in an intimate position.|$|E
500|$|In comparison, some reviewers {{were more}} {{critical}} of American Gangster. Jonathan Crocker of Time Out London was polarized with the film, criticizing its aesthetics. In his review, he wrote, [...] "Scott's meticulous aesthetics can’t touch the urban texture and deep focus of The French Connection, The Godfather, Serpico and Prince of the City – all looming heavily in intertextual nods." [...] In contrast, Crocker praised Washington's acting, writing, [...] "He's immense: centering every scene with tractor-beam charisma, that dangerous, easy charm hovering between a luxury smile or blazing violence." [...] In conclusion, Crocker gave the film three out of five stars. Similarly, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a 'C-' grade, expressing that American Gangster is [...] "never dull, {{but it could have}} used more good old-fashioned melodramatic intrigue." [...] Gleiberman found Washington's performance to have [...] "a ghastly ingenuity". Empires Ian Freer rated the film three stars out of five; he stated that it was [...] "undeniably enjoyable" [...] and praised the cast, but also noted that he felt that [...] "very little in the movie feels fresh, re-treading scenes, riffs and imagery from the whole history of crime flicks" [...] and that the film did not explore enough of Lucas' story and Scott's visual imagination. Slant Magazine journalist Nick Schager harshly criticized the film, giving the film a one out of four stars. Schager remarked that the film was [...] "dumb as a rock", and that it was [...] "far too convinced of its import to be any fun." [...] Giving American Gangster a two out of five stars, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian was disappointed with Washington's acting, asserting, [...] "He doesn't seem to relax and enjoy himself in the role, or even inhabit it very satisfyingly." [...] He resumed: [...] "He never has the menace of <b>his</b> <b>dirty</b> cop in Training Day, and we don't see anything like the transformation from street-hustler to leader in Malcolm X. That shoulder-shimmying swagger is rarely seen, and the brand-classic robes of American Gangster sit on him heavily." ...|$|E
