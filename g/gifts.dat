50|$|A charity <b>gift</b> card {{allows a}} <b>gift</b> giver {{to make a}} {{charitable}} donation that the <b>gift</b> recipient may direct to the charity of their choice. Although a charity <b>gift</b> card has many similarities to a store <b>gift</b> card, a charity <b>gift</b> card functions quite differently. A charity <b>gift</b> card is an indicator of control over a small donor advised fund. The purchaser of the charity <b>gift</b> card creates the donor advised fund with the charity <b>gift</b> card purchase money. When the charity <b>gift</b> card recipient “spends” the <b>gift</b> card, the recipient is in actuality advising the holder of the associated donor advised fund (typically the charity that issued the charity <b>gift</b> card) to send {{the money to the}} charity that the charity <b>gift</b> card recipient selects.|$|R

The UK Charities Aid Foundation set up a “Charity <b>Gift</b> Voucher” service in 1992.

5|$|A host treated his {{retainers}} {{very well}} and showered them with luxury <b>gifts</b> {{if he wanted to}} boast his wealth and status. One retainer even received a sword scabbard decorated with jade and pearls, while others were given items like shoes decorated with pearls. However, not all retainers shared the same status, as those showered with <b>gifts</b> often provided highly skilled work or greater services; retainers who were not as skilled were given lesser <b>gifts</b> and seated in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any retainer was allowed to come and go from his host's residence as he or she pleased, unlike a slave who was the property of his master and permanently attached to the estate. There was no official government policy {{on how to deal with}} retainers, but when they broke laws they were arrested, and when their master broke the law, sometimes the retainers were detained alongside him.|$|E

The results confirm the economic importance of <b>gift</b> exchange.

40|$|AbstractThe anthropological {{discourse}} on the <b>gift</b> repeatedly underlines the impossibility of a free <b>gift.</b> This {{seems to be a}} truly universal, trans-cultural and trans-historical fact, since the <b>gift</b> always follows the unavoidable Maussian obligations to give, to receive and to reciprocate – every <b>gift</b> implicitly demands a <b>gift</b> in return. From this anthropological perspective, the <b>gift</b> {{plays a major role in}} establishing personal ties between people. However, this been said, it does not imply that the personal ties are only between equals – for instance, potlatch is a <b>gift</b> used to establish status hierarchy among people, a <b>gift</b> of rivalry in which the one who receives a <b>gift</b> is obliged to respond with another <b>gift</b> of a greater value. In this article I intend to analyze the way in which legal rules that apply to donations manage to deal with <b>gift's</b> anthropological function in the context of authority and hierarchy, since the civil laws in European-continental legal family explicitly state that donations are unilateral and gratuitous acts, contradicting the anthropological discourse. In analyzing the function of legal provisions of the <b>gift</b> in the context of authority, I will use Alexandre Kojève's classification of subjects of authority – Master, Judge, Leader and Father – in order to see the way in which the <b>gift</b> functions in these ideal-type power relations and the role of the <b>gift</b> law in these particular symbolic contexts...|$|R
