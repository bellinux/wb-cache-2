5|$|The {{description}} of feathered dinosaurs {{has not been}} without controversy; perhaps the most vocal critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham-Soliar, who have proposed that some purported feather-like fossils {{are the result of}} the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs' skin, and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with vaned feathers were not actually dinosaurs, but convergent with dinosaurs. However, their views <b>have</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most part not been accepted by other researchers, {{to the point that the}} scientific nature of Feduccia's proposals has been questioned.|$|E

5|$|He also {{missed the}} {{opportunity}} to lead the original Sinister Six because he felt that joining the group would mean admitting he needed the help of others to rid himself of Spider-Man. Although he later formed the 'Sinister Twelve' when Spider-Man sent him to prison, he expressed anger at Mac Gargan for acquiring the Venom symbiote rather than using the new Scorpion suit provided for him simply because Gargan was not doing what he wanted, despite Venom being {{more powerful than the}} Scorpion. When he participated in the mystical ritual known as the Gathering of Five, he appeared convinced that he would automatically receive the gift of power from the ritual– which would bestow upon the participants power, immortality, knowledge, madness and death, respectively– only to receive the gift of madness instead, subsequently requiring an elaborate cocktail of drugs to restore himself to a semblance of sanity. During his time in charge of H.A.M.M.E.R. he was provoked into attacking Asgard by his Goblin side because his ego couldn't allow himself to consider the possibility that the Asgardians wouldn't threaten his power. Later events revealed that Loki at least slightly influenced Osborn's decision to further Loki's own goals. During his attempted takeover of Earth's superhuman security defenses, he was shown reflecting that humans are all barbarians who require the strong like him to control them, dismissing the Avengers as no better than him despite the obvious distinction between Osborn's demands for power and the straightforward respect that the general public <b>have</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Avengers.|$|E

25|$|In some {{cyberpunk}} writing, much of {{the action}} takes place online, in cyberspace, blurring the line between actual and virtual reality.

The judiciary's role in deciding the validity of presidential and parliamentary elections also necessitates independence of the judiciary.|$|E

25|$|Cuban-Pacific {{relations}} are diplomatic, economic, cultural and other {{relations between the}} Republic of Cuba and countries situated in Oceania. In the 2000s, Cuba has been strengthening its relations with Pacific nations, which <b>have,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most part, responded favourably to Cuban medical aid in particular. The first Cuba-Pacific Islands ministerial meeting was held in September 2008 in Havana, with government members from ten Pacific countries—Kiribati, Tuvalu, Nauru, Solomon Islands, Fiji, Tonga, Vanuatu, Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia and Papua New Guinea—attending. The meeting was a consolidation rather than a starting point of Cuban-Pacific relations.|$|E

25|$|Women {{have been}} active in brewing since ancient times and though Western {{societies}} <b>have</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> last 150 years viewed brewing as a male dominated field, traditionally, it was an activity engaged in by women.

From the earliest evidence of brewing, from 7000 BCE, until the commercialization of brewing during industrialization, women were the primary brewers on all inhabited continents. In many cultures, deities, goddesses and protectors of brewer were female entities and associated with fertility.|$|E

25|$|In Korea, it {{is common}} for {{siblings}} and cousins of the same generation to have one hanja syllable in common among all of their names; this is known as dollimja.

Koryo-saram often do not have Korean names, because of a poor command of the Korean language among their relatives; however, birth records show that many siblings have been given Russian names starting with the same letters of the alphabet by their parents, indicating that the practice of dollimja has continued in a localised form.|$|E

25|$|In Europe {{where the}} {{threshold}} for thyroid surgery {{is lower than}} in the United States, an elaborate strategy that incorporates serum calcitonin measurements and stimulatory tests for calcitonin has been incorporated into the decision to perform a thyroidectomy; thyroid experts in the United States, {{looking at the same}} data sets <b>have,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most part, not incorporated calcitonin testing as a routine part of their evaluation, thereby eliminating a large number of thyroidectomies and the consequent morbidity. The European thyroid community has focused on prevention of metastasis from small medullary thyroid carcinomas; the North American thyroid community has focused more on prevention of complications associated with thyroidectomy (see American Thyroid Association guidelines below).
