5|$|Edmund Evans (23 February 1826 – 21 August 1905) was a {{prominent}} English wood engraver and colour printer during the Victorian era.

He employed and collaborated with illustrators such as Walter Crane, Randolph Caldecott, Kate Greenaway and Richard Doyle to produce what are now considered to be classic children's books. Although little is known about his life, he wrote a short autobiography before his death in 1905 in which he described <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> printer in Victorian London.|$|E

5|$|Teuruarii's reign was {{disrupted}} by ongoing French expansionism in the Pacific.

Teuruarii was allowed to continue ruling as king until the annexation of the island to the territory of French Oceania in 1900, today part of the overseas country of French Polynesia.
