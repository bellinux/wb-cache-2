5|$|From 2005 to 2006, Clarkson {{embarked}} on three concert tours to promote Breakaway: the <b>Hazel</b> <b>Eyes</b> Tour, the Breakaway World Tour, and the Addicted Tour. The <b>Hazel</b> <b>Eyes</b> tour {{took place in}} various theaters throughout North America, with the concert at UCF Arena being streamed live on AOL and AOL Radio. The Breakaway World Tour, {{which took place in}} between the <b>Hazel</b> <b>Eyes</b> Tour, marked Clarkson's first world tour, visiting theaters and arenas throughout Europe and Oceania. Upon returning to the United States, she then {{embarked on}} the Addicted Tour, performing at various amphitheaters across North America.|$|E
25|$|Eleanor was {{remembered for}} her beauty: brunette with <b>hazel</b> <b>eyes,</b> an oval shaped face, sweet and full {{features}} of an inherent majestic quality, as evident in her portraits. Eleanor {{was seen as}} an incredibly charming bride entering the Medici household.|$|E
25|$|Sable champagne, {{a result}} of the {{dilution}} effect of the champagne gene. Like all champagnes, sable champagnes have <b>hazel</b> <b>eyes</b> and pinkish, freckled skin. The coat is a flat, diluted grayish- or purplish-brown, somewhere between the warm pumpkin tones of the bay-based amber champagne, and the cool purplish tones of the black-based classic champagne.|$|E

6000|$|When Rodney {{detailed}} to {{his friend}} the catastrophe that had occurred and all its sad consequences, Mr. Vigo heard him in silence, occasionally nodding his head in sympathy or approbation, or scrutinising a statement with his keen <b>hazel</b> <b>eye.</b> When his visitor had finished, he said-- ...|$|R
25|$|Amber {{champagne}} {{refers to}} a bay horse {{with at least one}} dominant champagne allele. Black pigment is diluted to warm brown and red pigment to gold. The effect is similar to buckskin, but the points of an amber champagne do not remain black, and the skin is mottled. Amber champagnes also have <b>hazel</b> <b>eyes</b> rather than brown.|$|E
25|$|Barbara Precht's {{body was}} {{pulled from the}} Ohio River on 29 November 2006. She was found wearing makeup and jewelry, {{including}} two necklaces of pearl-like beads that led to her nickname. She wore a black blouse and skirt, white socks, gray shoes, and tan nylon pantyhose. After an autopsy, {{it was concluded that}} she had been deceased for approximately two days; no suspicious signs were noted. The then-unidentified woman had suffered from arthritis in various parts of her body and had a fair complexion with <b>hazel</b> <b>eyes.</b> Examiners also discovered that she had very well-maintained teeth, as she had only one dental filling.|$|E
25|$|Hardin {{eventually}} {{adapted to}} prison life. While there, he read theological books, becoming {{the superintendent of}} the prison Sunday School, and studied law. He was plagued by recurring poor health, especially when the wound he had received from Sublett became re-infected in 1883, causing him to be bedridden for almost two years. In 1892, Hardin was described as 5 feet 9 inches tall and 160 pounds, with a fair complexion, <b>hazel</b> <b>eyes,</b> dark hair, and wound scars on his right knee, left thigh, right side, hip, elbow, shoulder, and back. During Hardin's stay in prison, his first wife, Jane, died, on November 6, 1892.|$|E
60|$|At length {{there was}} a general stir, and they all did come forth, Mr. Millbank among them, a well-proportioned, comely man, with a fair face inclining to ruddiness, a quick, glancing, <b>hazel</b> <b>eye,</b> the whitest teeth, and short, curly, {{chestnut}} hair, here and there slightly tinged with grey. It was a visage of energy and decision.|$|R
60|$|Oliver Cromwell {{arose from}} his seat as the two veteran soldiers, Zerubbabel Robins and Merciful Strickalthrow, {{introduced}} into the apartment the prisoner, whom they held by the arms, and fixed his stern <b>hazel</b> <b>eye</b> on Albert long before he could give vent to the ideas which were swelling in his bosom. Exultation was the most predominant.|$|R
6000|$|I hate boldness--that boldness {{which is}} of the brassy brow and insensate nerves; but I love the courage of the strong heart, the fervour of the generous blood; I loved with passion the light of Frances Evans' clear <b>hazel</b> <b>eye</b> when it did not fear to look {{straight}} into mine; I loved the tones with which she uttered the words-- ...|$|R
25|$|On January 1, 1985, {{another victim}} was found near Jellico, Tennessee, in Campbell County on interstate 75. Although her murder {{occurred}} three days before, presumably on December 30, 1984, {{she was already}} in an advanced state of decomposition. Like the others, she was white and had short red hair, which was somewhat curly. She was likely {{between the ages of}} 17 and 25, although she may have been as old as 30 at the time she was murdered. The victim was found clothed, with a tan pullover, a shirt and jeans. The Jane Doe had green or <b>hazel</b> <b>eyes,</b> which could not be positively confirmed as a certain color because of the state of her body. The young woman also had freckles, various scars and burn marks on her body and was two and a half to five months pregnant when murdered by an undisclosed method. She had no evidence of dental work, except for a partial denture holding two false teeth on her upper jaw.|$|E
500|$|Only {{one image}} of Virginia {{is known to}} exist, for which the painter had to take her corpse as model. A few hours after her death, Poe {{realized}} he had no image of Virginia and so commissioned a portrait in watercolor. She is shown wearing [...] "beautiful linen" [...] that Shew said she had dressed her in; Shew {{might have been the}} portrait's artist, though this is uncertain. The image depicts her with a slight double chin and with <b>hazel</b> <b>eyes.</b> The image was passed down to the family of Virginia's half-sister Josephine, wife of Neilson Poe.|$|E
500|$|The ideal coat {{color for}} the breed is a medium cream with pink skin, amber {{eyes and a}} white mane and tail. [...] The {{characteristic}} cream color of the breed is produced by the champagne gene. Recognized colors include light, medium and dark cream, with amber or <b>hazel</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] A cream mare with dark skin and a light mane and tail may {{be accepted by the}} registry as foundation stock, while stallions must have pink skin and white manes and tails to be registered. Purebred American Cream foals that are too dark to be accepted into the main breed registry may be recorded into an appendix registry. The appendix will also accept half-bred Cream Draft horses crossed with other draft bloodlines if they meet certain requirements, and the registry provides an upgrade system that uses appendix horses to strengthen genes, increase breed numbers, and allow more diversified bloodlines.|$|E
60|$|So it was, I say, {{with the}} young of my class {{and most of the}} young people in our world. So it came about that I sought Nettie on the Sunday {{afternoon}} and suddenly came upon her, light bodied, slenderly feminine, <b>hazel</b> <b>eyed,</b> with her soft sweet young face under the shady brim of her hat of straw, the pretty Venus I had resolved should be wholly and exclusively mine.|$|R
60|$|As soon as I clapped {{my eye on}} the captain, I thought myself he {{was just}} the captain to suit me. He was a fine looking man, about forty, splendidly dressed, with very black whiskers, and very white teeth, and what I took to be a free, frank look out of a large <b>hazel</b> <b>eye.</b> I liked him amazingly. He was promenading {{up and down the}} cabin, humming some brisk air to himself when we entered.|$|R
60|$|The {{prisoner}} {{appeared in}} the dock. He had become paler, and perhaps thinner, for his square determined jaw, and the resolute mould of his lips, were more than usually remarkable, and were noted in the physiognomical brain of Harvey Anderson; {{as well as the}} keen light of his full dark <b>hazel</b> <b>eye,</b> the breadth of his brow, with his shining light brown hair brushed back from it; the strong build of his frame, and the determined force, apparent even in the perfect quiescence of his attitude.|$|R
500|$|Breakaways singles [...] "Since U Been Gone", [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes", [...] "Because of You", [...] "Walk Away", and [...] "Breakaway" [...] became {{worldwide}} {{hits and}} have become some of Clarkson's signature songs. Their successes prompted Billboard to credit her for landscaping the core sound of mainstream pop music as an uptempo dance-oriented sound in the 2000s. Furthermore, Breakaway established Clarkson {{as one of the}} four highest-selling acts of Sony BMG in the 2000s, and made Davis, Dr. Luke, and Martin into prominent pop producers today. Internationally, the album topped the music charts of Ireland and the Netherlands and became the world's 7th biggest-selling release of 2005, eventually being certified platinum in over 17 countries. To support Breakaway, Clarkson embarked on three international concert tours from 2005 to 2006: the Breakaway World Tour, <b>Hazel</b> <b>Eyes</b> Tour, and the Addicted Tour. Billboard placed the album 77th in [...] the Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Albums.|$|E
500|$|Analyzing ways {{in which}} Disney's heroines have evolved {{overtime}} due to [...] "the approach to the characterization of the princesses chang" [...] as the characters gradually transformed from passive young women into heroines who [...] "had ambitions and desires aside from finding true love," [...] critics often divide the Disney Princesses into three separate categories and rank Belle among {{the middle of the}} timeline, with Kit Steinkellner of HelloGiggles observing that the character improved upon [...] "the Disney princess archetype" [...] by simultaneously serving as both a [...] "dreamer" [...] and a [...] "doer" [...] in her film, as opposed to exclusively the former. Film historian Paula Sigman Lowery explained to the Daily Express that Belle's personality is a combination of Ariel's spirit and burgeoning independence, and Pocahontas' maturity, while Belle is [...] "a little older [...] and a little further along in their journey towards independence." [...] About.com's David Nusair believes that Belle belongs to a category of Disney Princesses known as [...] "The Lady Vanishes," [...] in which the heroines, in spite of being brave, outspoken and independent, nonetheless [...] "are forced to behave passively as others help them achieve their respective goals." [...] Michelle Munro, writing for Durham College of Applied Arts and Technology, felt that even though Belle shares several traits with her more passive predecessors, the character introduced [...] "new possibilities for princesses." [...] Girls in Capes wrote that Belle pioneered a generation of princesses who taught [...] "about ambition, self-discovery and the pursuit of what we want." [...] Additionally, Belle remains Disney's first and only princess to have <b>hazel</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Early white explorers {{reported}} the Sinixt {{to be of}} average height and size, with <b>hazel</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] They were adept in making suspended bridges over the narrow, swift-flowing Columbia, and skillful at fishing.|$|E
60|$|Mr Blatherwick's dreamy <b>hazel</b> <b>eye</b> rested pensively upon her. The {{major portion}} of his mind was far away in the future, dealing with visions of a school grown to colossal proportions, and patronized by millionaires. The section of it which still worked in the present was just large enough to enable him to {{understand}} that he felt kindly, and even almost grateful, to Violet. Unfortunately it {{was too small to}} make him see how wrong it was to kiss her in a vague, fatherly way across the coffee tray just as James Datchett walked into the room.|$|R
5000|$|Cassandra's {{face has}} various {{elements}} {{to keep her}} unique, such as [...] "narrow eyebrows, heart-shaped face, strong jaw, darker lips, and walnut hazel eyes". The choice of walnut <b>hazel</b> <b>eye</b> colour served to further her authoritative look, appearing a bit warmer than blue eyes and giving her a harder edge. Similarly, her portraiture is heavily angular, to reflect her [...] "hard" [...] demeanor. For her appearance in Inquisition, concept artist Casper Konefal decided to ignore the subjective criteria of [...] "beauty", and try to focus her design on presenting her [...] "power and authority", trying to give her [...] "a strong aggressive forward visual flow".|$|R
60|$|As these {{thoughts}} swept through his mind, something {{passed in the}} air so near him as to dazzle his eyes, and almost to brush the plume in his cap. He looked up--it was the favourite falcon of Sir Halbert, which, flying around his head, seemed to claim his attention, {{as that of a}} well-known friend. Roland extended his arm, and gave the accustomed whoop, and the falcon instantly settled on his wrist, and began to prune itself, glancing at the youth from time to time an acute and brilliant beam of its <b>hazel</b> <b>eye,</b> which seemed to ask why he caressed it not with his usual fondness.|$|R
2500|$|Amber {{champagne}} vs. Buckskin: {{the action}} of the Champagne gene on bay can also produce a buckskin-like coat. Champagnes can be identified by their freckled skin, <b>hazel</b> <b>eyes,</b> and chocolate (rather than black) points.|$|E
2500|$|Gold {{champagne}} vs. Palomino: {{the action}} of the Champagne gene on chestnut was for many years called pumpkin-skinned palomino. However, lighter, freckled skin and <b>hazel</b> <b>eyes</b> identify a gold champagne, which can otherwise look much like a palomino.|$|E
2500|$|This [...] "Charles" [...] likely {{served in}} I Company of the 8th Infantry Regiment from November 9, 1849, to November 7, 1854. His {{description}} {{is listed as}} 5 feet 7 inches tall with <b>hazel</b> <b>eyes,</b> brown hair with a fair complexion. He enlisted in New York and ended his service at Fort Bliss, Texas, as a sergeant.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s {{after the end}} of World War II, Fairfax County was still a sparsely {{populated}} rural tract, but one poised to boom as a suburb of Washington, D.C. It was ideally positioned, located roughly 15 miles from D.C.’s core business district. Arlington County, situated between the Potomac River across from Washington and the eastern border of Fairfax County, already had seen substantial development during the war years, and its growth was showing no signs of slackening as the 1940s came to an end. It was the residential tract-housing development of Pimmit Hills, near his father’s old farm in Mclean, Virginia, that caught <b>Hazel’s</b> <b>eye.</b> It was 1950, and though he was off at college, he sensed an opportunity.|$|R
50|$|Leppert {{was known}} to have been between five feet four and five feet five inches tall and weighed between 105 and 115 pounds at the time she vanished. She had curly blond hair and <b>hazel</b> colored <b>eyes.</b> It is also speculated that she may have been three months pregnant.|$|R
5000|$|Stella (voiced by Jessica Paquet): Fairy of the Shining Sun. She has waist-length {{blonde hair}} and <b>hazel</b> brown <b>eyes.</b> She loves fashion and shopping. Her magic {{is derived from}} sunlight. In season 2, her Onyrix power gives her the ability {{to look into the}} {{memories}} made at a location.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the time}} of her death she was {{described}} as being five feet tall, with dark auburn hair, <b>hazel</b> <b>eyes,</b> and a tattoo that read [...] "TC", for Tom Conway, in blue ink on her left forearm. Friends of Eddowes described her as [...] "intelligent and scholarly, but possessed of a fierce temper" [...] and [...] "a very jolly woman, always singing." ...|$|E
2500|$|White {{horses are}} born white and stay white {{throughout}} their lives. White horses may have brown, blue, or <b>hazel</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] "True white" [...] horses, {{especially those that}} carry one of the dominant white (W) genes, are rare. Most horses that are {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "white" [...] are actually [...] "gray" [...] horses whose hair coats are completely white.|$|E
2500|$|Oswald's {{enlistment}} papers {{show his}} vital statistics as [...] in height, [...] in weight, with <b>hazel</b> <b>eyes</b> and brown hair. His primary training was in radar operation, {{which was a}} position that required a security clearance. A May 1957 document stated that he was [...] "granted final clearance to handle classified matter {{up to and including}} confidential after careful check of local records had disclosed no derogatory data." ...|$|E
5000|$|Artemis Fowl II is {{the main}} {{character}} of the Artemis Fowl series. He {{is the son of}} Artemis Fowl I and Angeline Fowl. He is commonly referred to as simply [...] "Artemis". Artemis is often called by his mother's pet name Arty ( [...] also by his father, Juliet and Occasionally Holly Short). He is extremely intelligent, having contributed to the fictional scientific journal The Psychologist's Journal under a pseudonym, Dr. F. Roy Dean Schlippe, and having the [...] "highest tested IQ in Europe". He thinks puberty is somewhat a pain. After the fifth book, it is known that he now has a <b>hazel</b> <b>eye</b> (courtesy of Captain Holly Short) and his index and middle fingers have switched places during a little time travel. He is possibly the only person who understands Foaly's little gizmos. Artemis is known now to also have a bit of magic in him, although his theft leads him to develop Atlantis Complex. He later has it treated.|$|R
60|$|Phoebe {{opened a}} map, and he eagerly traced his route, pronouncing {{the names of}} the {{historical}} localities with a relish that made her almost sorry for their present associations. She liked his looks. He seemed to be about two or three and twenty, tall and well-made, with somewhat of the bearing of his soldier-father, but broad-shouldered and athletic, as though his strength had been exercised in actual bodily labour. His clear, light <b>hazel</b> <b>eye</b> was candid and well opened, with that peculiar prompt vigilance acquired by living in a wild country, both steady to observe and keen to keep watch. The dark chestnut hair covered a rather square brow, very fair, though the rest of the face was browned by sun and weather; the nose was straight and sensible, the chin short and firm; the lips, though somewhat compressed when shut, had a look of good-humour and cheerful intelligence peculiarly pleasant to behold. Altogether, it was a face that inspired trust.|$|R
5000|$|McLeod {{appeared}} {{in dozens of}} other series including The Millionaire, Meet McGraw, Richard Diamond, Private Detective, 77 Sunset Strip, Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer, Bronco, Colt [...]45, Lawman (in the 1961 episode [...] "The Prodigal Mother", with child actor Billy Booth), Bonanza, <b>Hazel,</b> Hawaiian <b>Eye,</b> Have Gun - Will Travel, The Outer Limits, The Virginian, [...] "Letty, Gunsmoke" [...] and the Ten Thousand Horses Singing episode of Studio One opposite James Dean and John Forsythe.|$|R
