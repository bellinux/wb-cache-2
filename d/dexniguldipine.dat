40|$|Multidrug {{resistance}} {{can result}} from several factors and processes. Some types of multidrug resistance (MDR) were recognized whose patterns differ from pattern of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) associated MDR in several important ways. Although, there is limited evidence for effect of DHP on atypical MDR; based on some observations like noncompetitive inhibition of topoisomerase I by a DHP derivative (<b>Dexniguldipine),</b> it has been hypothesized that some DHP derivatives which have essential structural feature have possible effect on altering the topoisomerase II levels or activity which results in reversing topoisomerase-mediated MDR. If this hypothesis is verified, some new dihydropyridine can be synthesized with possible dual effect on both typical and atypical MDR...|$|E
40|$|The ATP-binding {{cassette}} transporter {{multidrug resistance}} 1 P-glycoprotein (MDR 1 Pgp) has been implicated with {{the transport of}} lipids from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. While this has been unambigously shown for the fluorescent lipid analogues [N-(7 -nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazol- 4 -yl) amino]hexanoyl (C 6 -NBD) -phosphatidylcholine, -phosphatidylethanolamine, -sphingomyelin and -glucosylceramide, by using a novel approach we have now found significantly increased outward transport also for C 6 -NBD-phosphatidylserine (C 6 -NBD-PS) in EPG 85 - 257 human gastric carcinoma cells overexpressing MDR 1 (coding for MDR 1 Pgp). The increased transport of C 6 -NBD-PS is mediated by MDR 1 Pgp, shown by transport reduction nearly {{to the level of}} controls in the presence of MDR 1 Pgp inhibitors [PSC 833, cyclosporin A and <b>dexniguldipine</b> hydrochloride (Dex) ]. Addition of MK 571, a specific inhibitor of the MDR protein MRP 1, does not decrease transport in either of the two cell lines. The plasma-membrane association of FITC-annexin V, a fluorescent protein conjugate binding PS, is significantly increased in MDR 1 -overexpressing cells as compared with controls, and can be reduced by an MDR 1 Pgp inhibitor. This suggests that MDR 1 Pgp transports endogenous PS, the lipid exhibiting the most pronounced transverse asymmetry in the plasma membrane...|$|E
40|$|The {{relevance}} of P 170 -glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) for the sensitivity to CPT- 11 {{was investigated in}} human malignant cell lines {{as well as in}} human tumour xenografts. In vitro, the P-gp-positive sublines BRO/mdr 1. 1 (transfected with MDR 1) and 2780 AD were slightly cross-resistant against carboxylesterase-activated CPT- 11. Cross-resistance against SN- 38 was present in 2780 AD cells, but not in BRO/mdr 1. 1 cells. The P-gp modulators BIBW 22 BS, verapamil and <b>dexniguldipine</b> partly reversed the resistance against CPT- 11 in the P-gp-positive sublines. BIBW 22 BS was the most effective modulator in the reversal of the resistance against carboxylesterase-activated CPT- 11 as well as against SN- 38 in the 2780 AD subline. In contrast to doxorubicin and vincristine, the BRO/mdr 1. 1 xenografts were at least as sensitive to CPT- 11 as the BRO xenografts. The 2780 AD xenografts were slightly less sensitive than the parent tumours, but {{there was no difference in}} topoisomerase I DNA unwinding activity. Therefore, the high retention of the multidrug-resistant phenotype of 2780 AD cells in vivo may be the cause of the low cross-resistance against CPT- 11. The MRP-positive subline GLC 4 /ADR was cross-resistant against carboxylesterase-activated CPT- 11 and SN- 38. GLC 4 /ADR cells, however, demonstrated a twofold lower topoisomerase I activity than GLC 4 cells. Cross-resistance against the camptothecin derivatives was not apparent in the MRP-transfected subline of SW 1573 /S 1. In conclusion, P-gp-positive cells show a low cross-resistance against CPT- 11 /SN 38, which is only apparent with high P-gp expression in vivo. MRP does not seem to play a role in the sensitivity to CPT- 11...|$|E
