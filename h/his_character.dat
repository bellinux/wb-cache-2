The dramatist who hangs <b>his</b> <b>characters</b> to <b>his</b> plot, instead of hanging his plot to <b>his</b> <b>characters,</b> is guilty of cardinal sin.|$|R

50|$|In Byron’s poetry, he {{incorporated}} deep feeling, {{rather than}} deep thinking, to make <b>his</b> <b>characters</b> strong.
