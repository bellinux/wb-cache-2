40|$|In Germany and Europe {{veterinary}} {{medicinal products}} are subject to strict regulatory requirements. As part of the authorisation procedure, active substances are investigated in regard to their effects on humans, animals and the environment. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) for humans of each active substance is derived {{on the basis of}} scientific studies. The ADI serves to determine maximum residue levels (MRL) for <b>foodstuff</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> (meat, kidney, fat, milk, eggs and honey). The MRL are determined so that the daily intake of veterinary medicinal product residues up to these levels is not expected to endanger the health of the consumer. In light of the discovery that plants are able to take up veterinary medicinal product residues from soil, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) carried out an expert panel in December 2009. The aim of the panel was to reveal the current state of scientific knowledge on the potential carry-over of veterinary medicinal product residues in foods of plant origin and its effects. It was determined that results from model experiments and modelling have provided initial indications for the behaviour of some active substances and their metabolites (transformation products) in slurry, in soil and in the plant. Yet current data do not allow a reliable estimate for the extent of intake of veterinary medicinal product residues through foods of plant origin. Overall experts agree, however, that based on the present data on antibiotics residues (e. g. sulfonamides, tetracyclines and fluorochinoloni) in foods of plant origin no risk is expected for consumers from a toxicological perspective. Furthermore it was determined that the question of the spread and development of resistance under the influence of individual or several antibiotics at low concentrations and over prolonged periods of time has not been investigated sufficiently...|$|E

40|$|Food {{products}} {{should not}} contain unsafe levels of chemical contaminants. However, {{it is not}} possible to monitor each and every one of the many thousands of chemicals that are used in our advanced societies. Chemical contaminants in <b>foodstuffs</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> may be classified into three categories: natural contaminants (e. g. mycotoxins), environmental contaminants linked to industrialisation and/or urbanisation (e. g. dioxins and dioxin-like compounds) and authorised chemical products (e. g. residues of veterinary medical products). Chemical hazards may contaminate <b>foodstuffs</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> all the way from farm to fork. Contamination may occur in any of the different production systems, and it is difficult to make comparisons between production systems (e. g. extensive versus intensive farming systems) with regard to food safety. Even when we take into account the latest analytical methods, which can detect ever-smaller quantities of residues, the relative importance of chemical contaminants seems to have declined during recent decades due to improvements in information and prevention. Nonetheless, individual incidents can never be ruled out and may have serious economic, health or social repercussions. Particular attention must be paid to chemical hazards, in order to reduce as much as possible the risks to livestock and to the consumer. Continued monitoring and periodic reassessment of risks posed by these contaminants (at the national level) are needed to detect or anticipate new problems, so that appropriate actions can be taken in the interest of public health. More attention should be paid to the production of detailed information, especially with regard to background data (e. g. the objectives of the monitoring, sampling methods, chemicals to be analysed, analytical methods, detection limits, raw data and specified units), in order to obtain a better basis for risk assessment.

30|$|Stahl et al. [6] {{described}} {{for the first}} time a significant, concentration-dependent transfer ('carry over') of PFCs from the soil to the plant. The higher the concentration of PFOA and PFOS in the soil, the higher the concentration that could be detected in the plants. The uptake and storage of these substances in the vegetative parts of the plants appear to be more significant than the transfer to the storage organs within the plants. In this study, the uptake, distribution, and storage of PFOA and PFOS were seen to be dependent upon the type of plant. The uptake of PFOA and PFOS from contaminated soil by plants enables the entrance of PFCs into the food chain of humans and may provide an explanation for the presence of these compounds in, for example, <b>foodstuffs</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin,</b> human blood samples, and human breast milk [6].|$|R
30|$|Aluminum occurs {{naturally}} {{in drinking water}} and in unprocessed foods [12, 15, 17 – 20]. This natural proportion is {{also referred to as}} the “primary content,” and represents the unavoidable aluminum content in foods [16].

But these alternatives provide only a partial solution to the scarcity of adequate drugs. A simplification of the procedures involved in drug marketing authorisations and MLRs is expected to promote the introduction of new medicinal products. Prescribers must comply with strict prescribing and dispensing rules due to their pharmacological classification. Dispensing renewals have time limits, which vary depending on the treatment.

So far, this list contains a single food category: dried aromatic herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings, and the authorized maximum absorbed dose is 10 kGy. In Spain, the specific regulation {{for the treatment of}} food with ionizing radiation, Royal Decree 348 / 2001, does not authorize the processing <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> and only allows the treatment of dried aromatic herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings. Nevertheless, taking into account different documents published by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and the EFSA (European Food Safety Authority), it can be concluded that meat irradiation might be an effective tool to reduce the content of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms not considered by Regulation (EC) No 2073 / 2005 on microbiological criteria for foodstuffs. In regard to potential toxicological considerations, foods irradiated in the range established by the legislation seem to be safe and nutritionally suitable. However an increase in quantity and variety <b>of</b> irradiated <b>foodstuffs</b> in the European Union is bound to predictably increase their daily intake in all population ranges and therefore it would be necessary to review the current studies to determine the actual risk due to a larger and ampler intake of radiolytic compounds...|$|R
40|$|Cupric chelate of {{amino acids}} hydrate is safe for all animal species/categories up to the {{authorised}} maximum of total copper content in complete feed. Consumption surveys include copper from <b>foodstuffs</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin.</b> Since the supplementation <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> feed with copper-containing compounds has not essentially changed over the last decade, {{no change in the}} contribution <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> originating from supplemented animals to the overall copper intake of consumers is expected. No concerns for consumer safety are expected from the use of cupric chelate of {{amino acids hydrate}} in animal nutrition, which would substitute for other copper sources. The additive should be considered as a skin and eye irritant and, owing to its amino acid/peptide component, as a skin/respiratory sensitiser. Potential risks to soil organisms have been identified {{as a result of the}} application of piglet manure. Levels of copper in other types of manure are too low to create a potential risk within the timescale considered. There might also be a potential environmental concern related to the contamination of sediment resulting from drainage and the run-off of copper to surface water. In order to draw a final conclusion, further model validation is needed and some further refinement to the assessment of copper-based feed additives in livestock needs to be considered, for which additional data would be required. The use of copper-containing additives in aquaculture up to the authorised maximum of total copper content in complete feeds is not expected to pose an appreciable risk to the environment. The extent to which copper-resistant bacteria contribute to the overall antibiotic resistance situation cannot be quantified at present. Cupric chelate of amino acids hydrate is recognised as an efficacious source of copper to meet animal requirements...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} physiological role {{of vitamin}} D in all vertebrates is in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. The classic clinical deficiency syndrome is rickets. The FEEDAP Panel notes that for turkeys for fattening, equines, bovines, ovines and pigs the maximum content for vitamin D 3 in feed {{does not provide}} any margin of safety, and that, except for pigs, the maximum content is above the upper safe level, according to National Research Council data when animals were fed a supplemented diet for more than 60 days. No safety concern was identified {{for the use of}} vitamin D 3 in chickens for fattening and fish. Not withstanding the long history of supplementing compound feed with vitamin D and the absence of publicly reported intolerances, the FEEDAP Panel is {{not in a position to}} draw final conclusions on the safety of vitamin D and considers the current maximum contents as temporarily acceptable. Any additional administration of vitamin D 3 via water for drinking represents a safety concern. Current nutritional surveys in 14 European countries showed that vitamin D intake is sufficiently below the upper safe limit. The FEEDAP Panel assumes that <b>foodstuffs</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> were produced following current production practices, including vitamin D 3 supplementation of feed and concludes that the use of vitamin D in animal nutrition at the currently authorised maximum dietary content has not and will not cause the tolerable upper intake level to be exceeded. Vitamin D 3 is not an irritant to skin and eyes and is not a skin sensitiser. Inhaled vitamin D 3 is highly toxic; exposure to dust is harmful to persons handling the additive. No risk to the environment resulting from the use of vitamin D 3 in animal nutrition is expected. The vitamin D 3 under application is regarded as an effective dietary source of the vitamin in animal nutrition...|$|R
40|$|The {{national}} residue {{monitoring plan}} is a programme aimed at the analysis <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> such as milk, meat, fish and honey that {{has been carried out}} since 1989 in the European Union (EU) according to standardised protocol. In addition, import products from third countries are controlled as part of the import residue monitoring plan. The aim is to uncover the use of prohibited substances as well as the improper use of restricted substances, to control the adherence to established maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products and to reveal the sources of residue. In Germany, the residue monitoring plans are coordinated by the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL). The sampling is organised by the Länder (German federal states), while BVL analyses the results and forwards the data to the European Commission. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) analyses the results in respect to consumer health protection. In 2008, 50153 animal or animal product samples were analysed in the national residue monitoring plan. In 198 cases, prohibited substances or concentrations of substances that exceeded the established maximum levels were detected. 1341 samples were taken for the import residue monitoring plan, and in 31 cases the residues and contaminants exceeded the established maximum levels or revealed the presence of substances that are not permitted. No product group displayed frequencies. Overall, the number of positive findings was low. In its assessment of residue levels, BfR comes to the conclusion that even if maximum levels are exceeded, one-time or occasional intake did not constitute a consumers health risk. It was once again determined that the kidneys and livers of sheep are the foodstuffs most affected by heavy metals. BfR thus maintains its recommendation to principally abstain from the consumption of these...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} facing animal agriculture in the 21 st century is to produce safe and traceable <b>foodstuffs</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> in sufficient volumes and quality besides the lowest possible load on the environment. A point to consider is how animal feeding and nutrition can contribute to the solution of this challenge. Another question is, that the results of which new scientific fields should be used in the area of innovation to achieve the desired product quality. The article answers these questions based on the latest data in the scientific literature and on the authors’ own research results. Having reviewed and processed the data, the authors drew the following conclusions: 1. The impact of climate changes on crop production and consequently on animal nutrition needs to be studied in comprehensive, systematic research programs, and based on their results animal feeding systems should be modified if necessary. 2. The role of molecular nutrition and the immunological role of nutrition for enhancing the efficiency of production will gain in importance. 3. The cooperation between nutritionists and geneticists needs to be strengthened in order to satisfy the nutrient requirements more accurately, and thus to improve the profitability of production. 4. New mathematical growth models, also incorporating the quality <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> products, need to be developed for better production estimates. 5. The integrated “from farm to fork” programs will be essential in the production of safe and high quality animal food products. Animal nutrition will {{play a key role in}} these product development and monitoring programs. 6. The production <b>of</b> environmentally friendly <b>animal</b> products will become a social imperative. Animal nutrition still has huge unexploited reserves in this field, for instance in the development <b>of</b> novel <b>animal</b> feeding systems and technologies. 7. T he practical implementation of precision nutrition can be of great help in achieving these goals and in improving the efficiency innovation activities...|$|R
40|$|DEXAMETHASONE (dex), {{betamethasone}} (BETA) and prednisolone (PREDN) are synthetic corticosteroids authorized in {{cattle breeding}} {{for the treatment}} of metabolic disorders and inflammatory diseases. In recent years, a widespread use of corticosteroids, as growth promoters, at lower doses than therapeutic ones, has been observed, despite the use of corticosteroids at different indications than those authorized and for purposes other than therapeutic is banned by the EU to safeguard the health of the consumer (Directive 2003 / 74 /EC). During 2007 a surveillance plan was conducted in several slaughterhouses of the Regione del Veneto and about 300 cattle were monitored; specimen of different tissues and organs were collected from 72 animals to detect, through chemical, biomolecular and histological examination, the presence of previous illicit treatments. Based on the results of the histological analyses on thymus samples, animals were classified into 23 Suspected/Doubts and 16 Negative. Liver samples from these 39 animals were analyzed for the presence of residues of steroids, and urines were analyzed for residues of natural cortisol and cortisone plus synthetic corticosteroids (1). To highlight the presence of corticosteroid residues, a multiresidue method in liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC‐MS) has been used to identify and quantify the presence of DEX, BETA and PREDN; the method has been validated for both matrix liver and urine. The data of confirmatory method adopted, indicated the DEX presence in 11 samples of bovine liver, 10 from the group <b>of</b> 23 <b>animals</b> classified as suspects by histological examination, while only 1 sample out of 16 was not negative; in 6 positive samples, DEX concentrations were higher than the allowed MRL (2 ug/kg). The analytical data confirm the high risk for the consumer <b>of</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> from cattle illegally treated with glucocorticoids. Based on the results obtained, it can be stated that the histological examination helps to doscriminate animals treted with corticosteroids (2). 1) Capolongo F. et al (2007) Anal. Chim.

40|$|Background and aims: Vegan diet {{excludes}} all <b>foodstuffs</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> {{and leads}} to cholesterol lowering and possibly reduction of cardiovascular disease risk. {{the aim was to}} investigate whether vegan diet improves the metabolic pathway of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, consisting in lipoprotein lipolysis and removal from circulation of the resulting remnants and to verify whether the diet alters HDL metabolism by changing lipid transfers to this lipoprotein. Methods and results: 21 vegan and 29 omnivores eutrophic and normolipidemic subjects were intravenously injected triglyceride-rich emulsions labeled with C- 14 -cholesterol oleate and H- 3 -triolein: fractional clearance rates (FCR, in min(- 1)) were calculated from samples collected during 60 min for radioactive counting. Lipid transfer to HDL was assayed by incubating plasma samples with a donor nanoemulsion labeled with radioactive lipids; % lipids transferred to HDL were quantified in supernatant after chemical precipitation of non-HDL fractions and nanoemulsion. Serum LDL cholesterol was lower in vegans than in omnivores (2. 1 +/- 0. 8, 2. 7 +/- 0. 7 mmol/L, respectively, p < 0, 05), but HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were equal. Cholesteryl ester FCR was greater in vegans than in omnivores (0. 016 +/- 0. 012, 0. 003 +/- 0. 003, p < 0. 01), whereas triglyceride FCR was equal (0. 024 +/- 0. 014, 0. 030 +/- 0. 016, N. S.). Cholesteryl ester transfer to HDL was lower in vegans than in omnivores (2. 7 + 0. 6, 3. 5 + 1. 5 %, p < 0, 05). Free-cholesterol, triglyceride and phospholipid transfer were equal, as well as HDL size. Conclusion: Remnant removal from circulation, estimated by cholesteryl oleate FCR was faster in vegans, but the lipolysis process, estimated by triglyceride FCR was equal. Increased removal of atherogenic remnants and diminution of cholesteryl ester transfer may favor atherosclerosis prevention by vegan diet. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
