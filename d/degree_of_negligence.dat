2500|$|Boat 7 was {{the first}} to be launched, at about 12:40a.m., under the {{supervision}} of First Officer Murdoch, supported by Fifth Officer Lowe. It had a capacity of 65 persons but was lowered with only 28 aboard. The two officers had tried for some minutes to encourage passengers to board but they were reluctant to do so. Later testimony at the U.S. Senate inquiry into the disaster stated the ship's officers believed the lifeboats were at risk of buckling and breaking apart if they were lowered while fully loaded. They intended that once the boats reached the water they would pick up passengers from doors in the ship's side or would pick up passengers in the water.

40|$|Credit rating {{agencies}} {{are vital to}} {{the operation of the}} global financial markets. They rate the ability of debtors to make timely interest payments and the likelihood of default. In the wake of the US subprime mortgage crisis, the credit rating industry sustained sharp criti- cism as it was revealed that they had systematically inflated ratings of mortgage-backed securities in the years prior to the crisis. As a result, investors that have suffered losses in the crisis filed lawsuits against the credit {{rating agencies}}. Furthermore, lawmakers in financial-centre-nations regulated the credit rating agencies extensively. This thesis analyses the liability of credit rating agencies to investors from a Swedish perspective. It identifies and analyses the applicable liability rules in Swedish private law and penal law. It also discusses central liability issues, namely the standard <b>of</b> care, <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence,</b> legal causation, factual causation, and the credit rating agencies’ standard disclaimers. The thesis is of interest for legal practitioners and legal scholars dealing with issues per- taining to the liability of credit rating agencies...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{understanding}} ethnic discrimination by employing a complex theoretical approach which allows for an understanding of ethnic relations and ethnic discrimination as a social process. The study includes a case study at Volvo Torslandaverken in Gothenburg, and focuses on ethnic discrimination against the background of both structural conditions and situational factors. The analysis results from studying personnel statistics and interviews with salaried employees, union elected representatives, and workers. The study includes two technical and organizational environments. The first environment, manual systems, demands loyalty of individuals to the technical and organizational system. The other environment, integrated mechanization, has a decentralized group organizational structure. Both environments are studied with consideration taken to recruiting, leadership, and solidarity among workers. The results show that ethnic discrimination appears to be a very complicated phenomena, the expression of which is a consequence of dynamic interplay between structure and action. New forms of work have meant that workers' professional skills are now organized to compliment one another and they work more in groups. This has resulted in an increased need for familiar cultural and social skills within the groups. Such a development risks encouraging varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence,</b> aversion, and exclusion of ethnic views. digitalisering@um...|$|R

40|$|Rediscovering the Law <b>of</b> <b>Negligence</b> {{offers a}} {{systematic}} and theoretical {{exploration of the}} law <b>of</b> <b>negligence.</b> Its aim is to re-establish the notion that thinking about the law ought to and can proceed {{on the basis of}} principle. As such, it is opposed to the prevalent modern view that the various aspects of the law are and must be based on individual policy decisions and that the task of the judge or commentator is to shape the law in terms of the relevant policies as she sees them. The book, then, is an attempt to re-establish the law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> as a body of law rather than as a branch of politics. The book argues that the law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> is best understood in terms of a relatively small set of principles enunciated in a small number of leading cases. It further argues that these principles are themselves best seen in terms of an aspect of morality called corrective justice which, when applied to the most important aspects of the law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> reveals that the law - even as it now exists - possesses a far greater <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> conceptual unity than is commonly thought. Using this method the author is able to examine familiar aspects of the law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> such as the standard of care; the duty of care; remoteness; misfeasance; economic loss; negligent misrepresentation; the liability of public bodies; wrongful conception; nervous shock; the defences <b>of</b> contributory <b>negligence,</b> voluntary assumption <b>of</b> risk, and illegality; causation; and issues concerning proof, to show that when the principles are applied and the idea of corrective justice is properly understood then the law appears both systematic and conceptually satisfactory.

50|$|There {{are three}} levels of civil {{copyright}} infringement: civil infringers may be “innocent”, “ordinary”, or “willful”. There is a range of penalties which can be imposed on criminal infringers depending on the egregiousness of the offense and in deference to prosecutorial discretion. Innocent infringers {{are those who are}} “not aware and had {{no reason to believe that}} his or her acts constituted infringement of copyright,” which implies that some <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> or knowledge is required for ordinary civil infringement. Willful infringement, by extension, requires a higher degree of culpability. The degree of knowledge or “willfulness” required for civil liability for copyright infringement is rather low and undefined. No knowledge or intent is strictly necessary for a finding of civil infringement, insofar as it is a strict liability offense. While in certain cases there are indications that willful infringement in a civil suit requires some knowledge that the defendant knew that, “his actions constituted copyright infringement or acted with a reckless disregard for the copyright holder’s rights,” this position is disputed and some Circuits merely require the infringement is “knowing” to warrant an aggravated penalty for the defendant.|$|E

40|$|It is a {{principle}} recognized by our {{as well as}} by other legal systems that ignorance of the law is no excuse for violating it. The rule is also expressed {{in the form of a}} legal presumption that everyone knows the law. It is the duty of every man to know that part of it which concerns him. A doctor, in particular, is conclusively presumed to know the law, and is dealt with as if he did know it, because in general he can and ought to know it. In the matter of professional liability, the medical profession differs from other occupations for the reason that the former operates in spheres where success cannot be achieved in every case and very often success or failure depends upon factors beyond a medical man’s control.

40|$|The injured party’s own conduct {{which has}} contributed to the damage that he has {{suffered}} has been a bar to the recovery of damages for centuries in the common law tradition. This article describes and analyses the historical development, from the early modern period until the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act of 1945, {{of the way in which}} English common law dealt with cases in which the behaviour of the injured party contributed to the occurrence of his damage – nowadays called ‘contributory negligence’.  Historically, contributory conduct was linked to the (broader) question of causation. The way in which cases involving contributory negligence were dealt with slowly developed from a very strict rule, depriving the injured party of his action even in the presence of the slightest <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> on his part  (leading to a so-called all-or-nothing approach), into a more lenient approach, in which attempts aimed at doing justice to the degree to which both parties contributed to the accident were made during the 19 th century. Furthermore, juries regularly mitigated the damages they awarded, rather than applying the all-or-nothing rule. The idea of a partition of damages seems to have emerged in English common law around the end of the 19 th century. In 1945, the possibility of a reduction, based on the respective degrees of the responsibility of the parties, was officially introduced with the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act, which is still in force today...|$|E

40|$|Background: In recent years, the Italian Supreme Court stated {{principles}} that led to: a) {{an increase in}} damages awarded to patients and premiums demanded by insurance, resulting in increased health care costs, b) the birth and growth of the so-called defensive medicine with major economic repercussions. The Italian legislator has tried to remedy the spread of defensive medicine by Law no. 189 / 2012. Objectives: The authors illustrate the actual innovations made by the legislature in medical liability system developed by the Italian Supreme Court in the last fifteen years. The authors analyze {{the question of the}} suitability of the reform: a) to eliminate the practice of defensive medicine; b) {{to reduce the amount of}} expenditure for compensation; c) to increase the serenity of the doctors in the practice. Methods: The authors analyze the effects of the new rules and compare them with the principles laid down by the Supreme Court on negligence, contractual liability and personal injury. Results/Discussion and Conclusions: Law no. 189 / 2012 confirms that the guidelines are not binding. In fact, the doctor who meets the guideline can also be declared liable when the circumstances of the case made ​​not applicable to the guideline itself. However, the legislative reform states that if the physician observes guidelines should not be applied, the penal responsibility can be established only when the conduct constitutes gross negligence of the doctor. Therefore, the legislator has decriminalised negligence. This new rule raises first issues of unconstitutionality. Furthermore, the application of a guideline also aimed to reduce health care spending could be considered as gross negligence because the Italian Supreme Court has stated that the predominance of the patient's health over economic interests of medical facilities is a basic rule. As a result, the doctor would still be convicted. With regard to civil liability, the legislative reform states that when there is ordinary negligence, the duty laid down in article 2043 of the Civil Code applies. Although the article 2043 of the Civil Code relates only to the pecuniary loss and non-contractual liability, the reform does not appear to change either the contractual nature of the medical liability or the obligation to compensate also the biological damage and the loss for pain and suffering. In fact, the law n. 189 / 2012 refers only to the obligation under article 2043 Civil Code, i. e. the obligation to compensate contra ius damages. As a result, article 2043 does not refer to the nature of liability, whether contractual or non-contractual. In addition, the concept of contra ius damage may also include the biological damage and the loss for pain and suffering. Otherwise, the legislative reform would be unconstitutional. Concerning the quantification of damages, the reform states that the court must take into account the fact that the physician has complied with the guidelines. But this rule determines unequal treatment of patients because the same damage caused with the same <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> would be compensated with different amounts depending on whether or not the doctor has followed the guidelines. Therefore, the suitability of the reform to reduce health costs for compensation and for defensive medicine is very questionable...|$|E
