As the holiday is observed in spring (March or April), the preparation of Passover borscht used to {{provide an opportunity to}} use up the beet sour left over from pickled beetroots that had been consumed during winter, remaining potatoes that had been stored throughout the winter and sour cream that was readily available in the new calving season. Cold borscht blended {{with sour cream}} is also popular on Shavuot (<b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Weeks),</b> a holiday customarily associated with dairy foods, observed in late May or early June.

2500|$|Shavuot (...) , the <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Weeks,</b> {{is one of}} {{the three}} pilgrimage festivals (Shalosh regalim) ordained in the Torah. Different from other Biblical holidays, the date for Shavuot is not {{explicitly}} fixed in the Torah. Instead, it is observed on the day following the 49th and final day in the counting of the Omer. In the current era of the fixed Jewish calendar, this puts the date of Shavuot as 6 Sivan. In Israel and in Reform Judaism, it is a one-day holiday; elsewhere, it is a two-day holiday extending through 7 Sivan.|$|E
2500|$|While defined {{mainly by}} their {{progress}} away from ritual, proto-Reform also pioneered new ones. In the 1810s and 1820s, the circles (Israel Jacobson, Eduard Kley and others) {{that gave rise}} to the movement introduced confirmation ceremonies for boys and girls, in emulation of parallel Christian initiation rite. These soon spread outside the movement, though many of a more traditional leaning rejected the name [...] "confirmation." [...] In the [...] "New Reform", Bar Mitzvah largely replaced it as part of the retraditionalization, but many young congregants in the United States still perform one, often at the <b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Weeks.</b> Confirmation for girls eventually developed into the Bat Mitzvah, now popular among all except strictly Orthodox Jews.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} the textual {{argument}} is given by North in his comparison of [...] with [...] The first passage establishes the timing, in days, for the Festival of Weeks (Shavuot), while the second prescribes the timing, in years, for the Jubilee. In the first passage, the start of counting for the Festival of Weeks {{is said to be}} [...] "the day after the Sabbath" [...] (mimaharat ha-shabat, [...] ), and is to end [...] "the day after the seventh Sabbath" [...] (mimaharat ha-shabat ha-sheviyit, [...] ). These seven weeks would constitute 49 days in most modern methods of reckoning. Nevertheless, verse 16 says that they are to be reckoned as 50 days. This method of reckoning (sometimes called [...] "inclusive numbering") is fairly common in Scripture; for example, the Feast of Tabernacles is to last for seven days (...) , but the last day is called the eighth day (v. 36). North found this comparison between Leviticus 23 (<b>Feast</b> <b>of</b> <b>Weeks)</b> and Leviticus 25 (Jubilees) to be [...] "the strongest possible support for the forty-ninth year" [...] as the Jubilee year. His conclusion that the Jubilee was identical with the seventh Sabbatical year was followed by Lefebvre, for this as well as additional reasons.|$|E

St. Peter expounded to them that the time of fulfilment was come, and that Jesus, crucified and risen, was their Salvation. 3,000 at once accepted the New Covenant, and were baptized; and thus, on the day of Pentecost, A.D. 33, the Church of Christ sprang into full life. Many of the converts sold their goods, and brought the price to the Apostles, all living on one common stock, and giving bounteous alms; but the new converts of Greek education, found their poor less well provided than the native Jews, and to supply them, seven deacons, or ministers, were set apart as the serving order of the ministry.
