2500|$|Murray {{complained to}} Victor Huguet (a French liaison officer serving with the British) about Wilson (6 October), but also told Wilson that French was getting “more unreasonable” and asked Wilson whether he (Murray) should resign; Wilson {{informed}} Billy Lambton, French’s secretary, {{of both of}} these incidents. Murray also (4–5 November) complained and threatened to resign when Wilson amended one of his orders without telling him. Murray later wrote (in 1930) [...] "Why did I stay with (this) War Office clique when I knew I was not wanted? I wanted to see Sir John through. I had been so many years with him, and knew better than anyone how his health, temper and temperament rendered him unfit, in my opinion, for the crisis we had to face. ..... the senior members (of GHQ staff) entirely <b>ignored</b> <b>me,</b> as far as possible, continually thwarted me, even altered my instructions." [...] He also claimed that Wilson's disloyalty had left him the impossible job of managing Sir John alone. Rawlinson noted in his diary that Murray became “a cipher at GHQ” (28 Nov 1914), was disliked by his subordinates (4 December) and that Sir John French often ignored his staff “chiefly because Murray is incapable of managing them and getting any good work out of them” (6 Dec 1914). Edmonds later claimed that Murray sometimes falsified the timing of orders, but he was given away by the time stamp which the duty clerk placed on them.|$|E

For as far back as my memory goes, Johnny had got his brose three times a week from Jess, his custom being to walk in without ceremony, and, drawing a stool to the table, tell Leeby that he was now ready. One day, however, when I was in the garden putting some rings on a fishing-wand, Johnny pushed by me, with no sign of recognition on his face. I addressed him, and, after pausing undecidedly, he <b>ignored</b> <b>me.</b> When he came to the door, instead of flinging it open and walking in, he knocked primly, which surprised me so much that I followed him.|$|E

The night after the Indians recaptured your brother, Betty and I stood out in the {{moonlight}} and she looked so bewitching and I felt so sorry for her and so carried away by my love for her that I yielded to a momentary impulse and kissed her. I simply could not help it. There is no excuse for me. She struck me across the face and ran into the house. I had intended that night to tell her of my love and place my fate in her hands, but, of course, the unfortunate occurrence made that impossible. As I was to leave at dawn next day, I remained up all night, thinking what I ought to do. Finally I decided to write. I wrote her a letter, telling her all and begging her to become my wife. I gave the letter to your slave, Sam, and told him it was a matter of life and death, and not to lose the letter nor fail to give it to Betty. I have had no answer to that letter. Today she coldly <b>ignored</b> <b>me.</b> That is my story, Col. Zane." ...|$|E

[...] "Some mistake, sir; it's Eunice he is engaged to." [...] I confess I forgot myself. [...] "How the devil do you know that?" [...] I burst out. Mrs. Tenbruggen <b>ignored</b> <b>me</b> and my language. [...] "I am sorry to see, sir, that your son's {{education}} has been neglected; he seems to be grossly ignorant of the laws of politeness." [...] "Never mind the laws of politeness," [...] says my father. [...] "You appear to be better acquainted with my son's matrimonial prospects than he is himself. How is that?" [...] Mrs. Tenbruggen favored him with another ready reply: [...] "My authority is a letter, addressed to me by a relative of Mr. Gracedieu--my dear and intimate friend, Miss Jillgall." [...] My father's keen eyes traveled backward and forward between his female surgeon and his son. [...] "Which am I to believe?" [...] he inquired. [...] "I am surprised at your asking the question," [...] I said. Mrs. Tenbruggen pointed to me. [...] "Look at Mr. Philip, sir--and you will allow him one merit. He is capable of showing it, when he knows he has disgraced himself." [...] Without intending it, I am sure, my father infuriated me; he looked as if he believed her. Out came one of the smallest and strongest words in the English language before I could stop it: [...] "Mrs. Tenbruggen, you lie!" [...] The illustrious Rubber dropped my father's hand--she had been operating on him all the time--and showed us that she could assert her dignity when circumstances called for the exertion: [...] "Either your son or I, sir, must leave the room. Which is it to be?" [...] She met her match in my father. Walking quietly to the door, he opened it for Mrs. Tenbruggen with a low bow. She stopped on her way out, and delivered her parting words: [...] "Messieurs Dunboyne, father and son, I keep my temper, and merely regard you as a couple of blackguards." [...] With that pretty assertion of her opinion, she left us.|$|E
