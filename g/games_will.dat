50|$|Pack-in {{games are}} {{generally}} {{intended to be}} desirable enough to help sell the system, and {{make good use of}} its positive features. Sometimes a pack-in <b>game</b> <b>will</b> be changed to a more popular game, or another <b>game</b> <b>will</b> be added, along with the original pack-in, if it is perceived that a newer <b>game</b> <b>will</b> sell more systems. Pack-in games are often the most plentiful games at used game shops.|$|R

5|$|The 114th IOC Session, in 2002, {{limited the}} Summer Games {{programme}} {{to a maximum}} of 28 sports, 301 events, and 10,500 athletes. Three years later, at the 117th IOC Session, the first major programme revision was performed, which resulted in the exclusion of baseball and softball from the official programme of the 2012 London Games. Since there was no agreement in the promotion of two other sports, the 2012 programme featured just 26 sports. The 2016 and 2020 <b>Games</b> <b>will</b> return to the maximum of 28 sports given the addition of rugby and golf.|$|E
5|$|All three {{consoles}} provide titles {{from older}} consoles for download; the Xbox 360 through the Xbox Originals service, the PlayStation 3 through the PlayStation Store, and the Wii through the Virtual Console. When purchased, {{the game is}} saved to console's internal memory or, optionally on the Wii, to an inserted SD/SDHC card. Initially the Xbox 360 also provided Xbox Live support for backwards compatible games, but the service has since been discontinued for original Xbox games. No more <b>games</b> <b>will</b> {{be added to the}} list of backwards compatible games for the Xbox 360. In response to the lack of backward compatibility for most PS3s, many popular games have been released for download as PlayStation 2 Classics and other popular series have been updated with gameplay/graphics as high-definition remasters for PlayStation consoles and have been released on Blu-ray Disc or are available for download on the PlayStation Network.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the Olympic Games were {{complemented by}} the Youth Games, which give athletes {{between the ages}} of 14 and 18 the chance to compete. The Youth Olympic Games were {{conceived}} by IOC president Jacques Rogge in 2001 and approved during the 119th Congress of the IOC. The first Summer Youth Games were held in Singapore from 14–26 August 2010, while the inaugural Winter Games were hosted in Innsbruck, Austria, two years later. These <b>Games</b> <b>will</b> be shorter than the senior Games; the summer version will last twelve days, while the winter version will last nine days. The IOC allows 3,500 athletes and 875 officials to participate at the Summer Youth Games, and 970 athletes and 580 officials at the Winter Youth Games. The sports to be contested will coincide with those scheduled for the senior Games, however there will be variations on the sports including mixed NOC and mixed gender teams as well as a reduced number of disciplines and events.|$|E
5|$|In both games, {{there are}} many {{circumstances}} when a previous item can be upgraded into a more useful form. The latter three dungeons in both <b>games</b> <b>will</b> hold a more powerful version of an item received earlier in the game. Both the sword's offensive power and the shield's defensive abilities can be upgraded twice, once through passwords and again through side quests. If Link swings an enhanced sword at full health, a sword-shaped beam will escape from the sword as a ranged attack. The number of bombs and Mystical Seeds that can be held can also be increased through the same ways as the shield and sword. Roc's Feather and the Power Bracelet are special cases, as, while the two are in both games, the former can only be upgraded in Oracle of Seasons while the latter only in Oracle of Ages.|$|E
5|$|The Youth Olympic Games (YOG) is an {{international}} multi-sport event organized by the International Olympic Committee. The games are held every four years in staggered summer and winter events consistent with the current Olympic Games format. The first summer version was held in Singapore from 14 to 26 August 2010 while the first winter version was held in Innsbruck, Austria from 13 to 22 January 2012. The age limitation of the athletes is 14 to 18. The idea of such an event was introduced by Johann Rosenzopf from Austria in 1998. On 6 July 2007, International Olympic Committee (IOC) members at the 119th IOC session in Guatemala City approved {{the creation of a}} youth version of the Olympic Games, with the intention of sharing the costs of hosting the event between the IOC and the host city, whereas the traveling costs of athletes and coaches were to be paid by the IOC. These <b>Games</b> <b>will</b> also feature cultural exchange programs and opportunities for participants to meet Olympic athletes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>game</b> <b>will</b> {{not require}} a player {{to play for a}} certain period of time or {{complete}} certain tasks in order to use certain weapons or weapon attachments. All guns and equipment in the <b>game</b> <b>will</b> be available for players to use without having to unlock them. This design concept stresses the fact that the <b>game</b> <b>will</b> be primarily skill-based. The developers are planning on releasing downloadable content that only affect the aesthetics of equipment and weapons.|$|R
50|$|The {{winner of}} this <b>game</b> <b>will</b> earn the Big Ten's {{automatic}} {{berth in the}} Rose Bowl Game, unless the team is selected {{to play in the}} four-team College Football Playoff.

5|$|When {{development}} {{began in}} December 2007, the studio had employed five full-time team members. Development took eight weeks, though {{creation of the}} Velociraptor and jeep models had already been started before development began. Other staff {{were working on the}} title before then, but two key members were involved in the Independent Games Festival. A teaser trailer was released on January 18, 2008; quickly garnering interest from gaming blogs such as Kotaku and Destructoid. In an interview the developers hinted that a non-free downloadable version with extra content may be produced, or that advertisements may be introduced to the site. The company also revealed plans to continue developing free games with a development time of four to eight weeks. The most popular of these <b>games</b> <b>will</b> be further developed and released on platforms such as WiiWare, PlayStation Network or Xbox Live Arcade.|$|E

50|$|A game's physics {{programmer}} {{is dedicated}} to developing the physics a <b>game</b> <b>will</b> employ. Typically, a <b>game</b> <b>will</b> only simulate a few aspects of real-world physics. For example, a space game may need simulated gravity, but would not have any need for simulating water viscosity.|$|R
