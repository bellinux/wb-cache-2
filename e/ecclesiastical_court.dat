5|$|The {{privilege}} of trial by peers was still ill-defined, and the statute did not cover peeresses. In 1442, after an <b>ecclesiastical</b> <b>court</b> (which included King Henry VI of England, Henry Beaufort and John Kemp) found Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester, guilty of witchcraft and banished {{her to the}} Isle of Man, a statute was enacted granting peeresses the right of trial by peers.|$|E
5|$|However, not {{everything}} was always harmonious between {{the king and}} the archbishop. In 1156, Theobald supported the efforts of Osbert de Bayeux, {{who was accused of}} poisoning William the Archbishop of York, to secure a trial for his alleged crimes in an <b>ecclesiastical</b> <b>court</b> rather than in the royal court. The crime had taken place during Stephen's reign, but Stephen's death had prevented Osbert from being tried in 1154. The delay allowed the shifting of the trial to the church courts, which Henry opposed. Although Theobald's position displeased the king no open rupture ensued. Theobald himself admitted to the papacy in 1154 that English custom was to try clergy for crimes in the secular courts.|$|E
5|$|Osbert de Bayeux (floruit 1121 to 1184) was {{a medieval}} English cleric and archdeacon in the Diocese of York. A {{relative}} of Thurstan, the Archbishop of York, Osbert probably owed his ecclesiastical positions to this relative. After Thurstan's death, Osbert {{was opposed to}} one of the candidates for the archbishopric, William fitzHerbert, and worked to secure fitzHerbert's deposition and replacement by Henry Murdac. After Murdac's death in 1153, Osbert tried to prevent the return of fitzHerbert, but these attempts were unsuccessful. When fitzHerbert died suddenly in 1154, Osbert was accused of murdering the newly returned archbishop. Although he was never convicted of the murder in either a secular or an <b>ecclesiastical</b> <b>court,</b> he was stripped of his clerical status and became a layman before 1158. He died after 1184, perhaps even after 1194.|$|E
50|$|Abortion {{was dealt}} with by the <b>Ecclesiastical</b> <b>Courts</b> in England, Scotland and Wales. Until the Reformation it was dealt with under {{the laws of the}} Catholic Church. The <b>Ecclesiastical</b> <b>Courts</b> dealt mainly with the issue due to {{problems}} of evidence in such cases. The <b>Ecclesiastical</b> <b>Courts</b> had wider evidential rules and more discretion regarding sentencing. Although the <b>Ecclesiastical</b> <b>Courts</b> heard most cases of abortion, some cases such as the Twinslayers Case were heard in the Secular <b>Courts.</b> The old <b>Ecclesiastical</b> <b>Courts</b> were made defunct after the Reformation.|$|R

50|$|<b>Ecclesiastical</b> <b>courts</b> {{had existed}} since the Norman invasion. While secular courts were tasked with {{enforcing}} secular laws, {{the responsibility of}} the <b>ecclesiastical</b> <b>courts</b> was to enforce religious and moral laws. This included discipline of the clergy, enforcement of probate and wills, as well as enforcement of laws that kept the laity within moral bounds. These <b>ecclesiastical</b> <b>courts</b> were very powerful until the late 17th century, when the Glorious Revolution removed much of their power. The remaining jurisdiction of the <b>ecclesiastical</b> <b>courts</b> was removed in the 19th century.|$|R
5|$|Charged {{with the}} crime of heresy, based on her claim of visions and signs from God, she is tried in an <b>ecclesiastical</b> <b>court</b> proceeding, which is forced by the English {{occupation}} government. The English wish to quickly condemn and execute Joan since English soldiers are afraid to fight while she remains alive, based on their belief that she could supernaturally affect battles even while in prison. Bishop Cauchon expresses his fear of wrongfully executing someone who might have received visions from God. About to be burned for heresy, Joan is distraught {{that she will be}} executed without making a final confession. The Bishop tells her she must recant her visions before he can hear her confession. Joan signs the recantation. The relieved Bishop shows the paper to the English, saying that Joan can no longer be burned as a heretic. Whilst in her cell, Joan is confronted by an unnamed cloaked man (Dustin Hoffman), who is implied to be Joan's conscience. The man makes Joan question whether she was actually receiving messages from God.|$|E
5|$|In {{supporting}} Calvin's {{proposals for}} reforms, {{the council of}} Geneva passed the Ordonnances ecclésiastiques (Ecclesiastical Ordinances) on 20 November 1541. The ordinances defined four orders of ministerial function: pastors to preach and to administer the sacraments; doctors to instruct believers in the faith; elders to provide discipline; and deacons {{to care for the}} poor and needy. They also called for the creation of the Consistoire (Consistory), an <b>ecclesiastical</b> <b>court</b> composed of the lay elders and the ministers. The city government retained the power to summon persons before the court, and the Consistory could judge only ecclesiastical matters having no civil jurisdiction. Originally, the court had the power to mete out sentences, with excommunication as its most severe penalty. The government contested this power and on 19 March 1543 the council decided that all sentencing would be carried out by the government.|$|E
5|$|Osbert {{was accused}} of murdering William, {{specifically}} by poisoning him through the communion chalice. A fellow cleric, Symphorian, {{who had been a}} chaplain of the deceased archbishop, brought murder charges against Osbert. Symphorian obtained a hearing on the charges at a royal council presided over by King Stephen of England at Michaelmas in 1154, but Stephen's subsequent death prevented a resolution. Osbert attempted to have the trial switched to an <b>ecclesiastical</b> <b>court</b> and was supported in his efforts by Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury. A trial was finally held in 1156 and Osbert's accuser did not produce any witnesses, but Osbert was unable to prove his innocence, prompting the transfer of the case to a papal court. No record of any judgment exists, but Osbert apparently appeared before two popes, Adrian IV and Alexander III. A further appeal to the papal court was referred to papal judges-delegate between 1175 and 1180.|$|E
