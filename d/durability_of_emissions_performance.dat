This paper aims to examine the carbon <b>emission</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> a set of independent {{oil and natural}} gas producers in the United States for the period 2011 – 2015. For each producer, we manually collect its drilling, oil production and gas production data from the annual reports, and extract the carbon emissions data from the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). We develop empirical models based on the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach and the Malmquist index measurement. The proposed DEA models generate unified efficiency scores to capture the carbon <b>emission</b> <b>performance</b> under natural disposability and managerial disposability respectively. Then the DEA-based Malmquist indexes are derived to measure the change <b>of</b> carbon <b>emission</b> <b>performance</b> over time.

Under managerial disposability, the indexes exhibit significantly greater dispersions than the indexes under natural disposability, and there is an industry-wide loss of efficiency in terms of technical change. The sustainable development of the independent oil and gas producers requires them to invest more in emission mitigation measures, such as energy conservation, leak detection and repair, flaring reduction, and even renewable energy...|$|R

Although public transport may play an important role, there are still many people relying on private vehicles, and, especially in urban areas, motorcycles and scooters can combine handling and flexibility with lower cost of operation compared to passenger cars. However, in spite of their lower fuel demand, they might significantly contribute to air pollution, lagging behind cars in terms <b>of</b> <b>emission</b> <b>performances.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this paper is to provide the scientific community with the results of an exploratory test campaign on four different motorcycles, converted from gasoline to CNG by means of an after-market conversion kit. A fifth motorcycle, similarly converted from gasoline to LPG, was also tested. These vehicles are powered by 4 -strokes engines with a displacement ranging from 50 to 250 cm 3 and a power ranging from 3. 0 to 16. 5 kW. They have been tested over the relevant phases of the ECE- 47, ECE- 40 and WMTC driving cycles, with both gasoline and gaseous fuel. Gaseous emissions results show the dependence of HCs, CO, CO 2, NOx and CH 4 on the engine displacement, fuel, injection and catalyst technology. Additionally the energy efficiency and the environmental impact of the different tested configurations have been analyzed in terms of equivalent energy consumption and GWP. The results suggest that the CNG fuel with the appropriate injection technology might be a viable solution to combine low cost of operation with low gaseous emissions and global warming impact.

Therefore, a detailed analysis <b>of</b> the carbon <b>emission</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> industrial land use is necessary for making reasonable carbon reduction policies that promote the sustainable use of industrial land. This paper aims to analyze the dynamic changes in the total-factor carbon <b>emission</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> industrial land use (TCPIL) in China by applying a global directional distance function (DDF) and non-radial Luenberger productivity index.

40|$|Field {{emission}} from carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in {{the form}} of arrays or thin films give rise to several strongly correlated process of electromechanical interaction and degradation. Such processes are mainly due to (1) electron-phonon interaction (2) electromechanical force field leading to stretching of CNTs (3) ballistic transport induced thermal spikes, coupled with high dynamic stress, leading to degradation <b>of</b> <b>emission</b> <b>performance</b> at the device scale. Fairly detailed physics based models of CNTs considering the aspects (1) and (2) above have already been developed by these authors, and numerical results indicate good agreement with experimental results. What is missing in such a system level modeling approach is the incorporation of structural defects and vacancies or charge impurities. This is a practical and important problem {{due to the fact that}} degradation <b>of</b> field <b>emission</b> <b>performance</b> is indeed observed in experimental I-V curves. What is not clear from these experiments is whether such degradation in the I-V response is due to dynamic reorientation of the CNTs or due to the defects or due to both of these effects combined. Non-equilibrium Green’s function based simulations using a tight-binding Hamiltonian for single CNT segment show up the localization of carrier density at various locations of the CNTs. About 11 % decrease in the drive current with steady difference in the drain current in the range of 0. 2 - 0. 4 V of the gate voltage was reported in literature when negative charge impurity was introduced at various locations of the CNT over a length of ~ 20 nm. In the context <b>of</b> field <b>emission</b> from CNT tips, a simplistic estimate of defects have been introduced by a correction factor in the Fowler-Nordheim formulae. However, a more detailed physics based treatment is required, while at the same time the device-scale simulation is necessary. The novelty of our present approach is the following. We employ a concept of effective stiffness degradation for segments of CNTs, which is due to structural defects, and subsequently, we incorporate the vacancy defects and charge impurity effects in the Green’s function based approach. Field emission induced current-voltage characteristics of a vertically aligned CNT array on a Cu-Cr substrate is then simulated using a detailed nonlinear mechanistic model of CNTs coupled with quantum hydrodynamics. An array of 10 vertically aligned and each 12 m long CNTs is considered for the device scale analysis. Defect regions are introduced randomly over the CNT length. The result shows the decrease in the longitudinal strain due to defects. Contrary to the expected influence of purely mechanical degradation, this result indicates that the charge impurity and hence weaker transport can lead to a different electromechanical force field, which ultimately can reduce the strain. However, there could be significant fluctuation in such strain field due to electron-phonon coupling. The effect of such fluctuations (with defects) is clearly evident in the field emission current history. The average current also decreases significantly due to such defects...|$|R

Environmental sociologists and organizational scholars {{have recently been}} interested in the origins of voluntary environmental programs and their various outcomes. Similarly, this dissertation examines the adoption of ISO 14001 known as the most famous voluntary environmental program and its consequence in the Korean context. More specifically, I situate the motivation to adopt ISO 14001 and its various outcomes {{in the context of}} two theoretical frameworks: resource-based view and institutional theory. I begin by using event-history modeling to examine firms' adoption of ISO 14001 in Korea between 1996 and 2011. I find that both resource-based and institutional factors have influenced the diffusion of ISO 14001. By exploring time-related effects, I also find that while resource-based factors are important in the early periods of the diffusion, institutional factors become important in the later periods of the diffusion. I then explore the effects of ISO 14001 on pollutant emissions among facilities in Korea from 2004 to 2011. Using data from the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) program of Korea, I find that the adoption of ISO 14001 does not affect the changes <b>of</b> <b>emission</b> <b>performance</b> from 2004 to 2011. This finding indicates that ISO 14001 has been adopted as a symbol to show off organizational commitment to societal requests for environmental responsibility, but not as an instrument to become greener. Moreover, this finding suggests that the institutional context favorable to the diffusion of ISO 14001 [...] in particular, the Korean government's active involvement in the diffusion of ISO 1400 [...] is not likely to lead to the improvement in environmental quality. I conclude the dissertation with a discussion of what these two studies tell us about corporate social responsibility in Korea and, broadly, East Asia...|$|R

Hence, NOx and CO emissions, which are strongly affected by the temperature, would be more realistic if the emissions formation is calculated according to the thermodynamic properties from the burned zone.

We study the channel coordination problem of a two-level supply chain (i. e., a buyer and a vendor) under emission regulations.

We analytically show and numerically illustrate that the average annual <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> the system do not necessarily decrease when the buyer and the vendor make coordinated decisions.

Unlike a cap and trade system, an <b>emissions</b> <b>performance</b> standard does not guarantee a certain overall level <b>of</b> <b>emission</b> reductions, a fact {{that has led to}} significant criticism. However, because of the dynamics of performance standards, they may reduce concerns over reductions in international competitiveness in cases where a country has climate policies that are more aggressive than those of some of its trade partners. Likewise, a performance standard may mesh more efficiently with existing taxes and therefore cause less overall economic impact than an absolute cap and trade system. This paper considers the theoretical arguments for and against such a performance standard system and evaluates it in comparison to a cap and trade system using a dynamic general equilibrium model applied to Canada. ...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{distributed}} {{power generation}} {{as an alternative}} method to the conventional power generation system continue to be developed to improve its commercialization capabilities. The cogeneration system and trigeneration system are technological improved alternatives in distributed generation where they offer enhancement and reliability in term <b>of</b> efficiency, <b>emission</b> <b>performances</b> and economic benefits. However, it is more feasible to implement the trigeneration system for most commercial and domestic distributed generations as the cooling demand is deliberately high compared to heating demand especially in hot and humid climate locations. Moreover, micro gas turbine is observed to be a beneficial prime mover in cogeneration and trigeneration system based on several criteria such as ability on acquiring high heat to power ratio characteristic as well as lower greenhouse gas emission. On the other hand, the role photovoltaic in building integrated system provides opportunities for renewable energy system engagement in trigeneration based distributed generation systems. This paper emphasize on summarizing the research work perform on cogeneration system or trigeneration system in hybrid mode with photovoltaic. There are also preceding sections on overviewing the state of art of cogeneration system and the trigeneration system as well as photovoltaic technologies in power generation...|$|R
