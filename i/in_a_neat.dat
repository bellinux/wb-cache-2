5|$|In 1955 Pei's group took a {{step toward}} {{institutional}} independence from Webb and Knapp by establishing a new firm called I.M. Pei & Associates. (The name changed later to I.M. Pei & Partners.) They gained the freedom to work with other companies, but continued working primarily with Zeckendorf. The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed architectural models. They took on the Kips Bay residential area {{on the east side of}} Manhattan, where Pei set up Kips Bay Towers, two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide shade and privacy) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>neat</b> grid, adorned with rows of trees. Pei involved himself in the construction process at Kips Bay, even inspecting the bags of concrete to check for consistency of color.|$|E
5|$|Large crowds {{started to}} gather {{early in the}} day {{including}} many people who had travelled to Bristol to see the spectacle. There was a general atmosphere of anticipation as the Royal Emblem was unfurled. The processional route had been cleaned and Temple Street decorated with flags, banners, flowers and ribbons. Boys of the City School and girls of Red Maids were stationed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>neat</b> orderly formation down {{the entire length of the}} Exchange. The route was a mass of colour and everybody was out on the streets as it was a public holiday. The atmosphere of gaiety even allowed thoughts to drift away from the problems of political dissension in London.|$|E

25|$|Three days later, Parma welcomed Catania to the Tardini. Parma {{started the}} game in the perfect fashion, opening the scoring after five minutes through a Francesco Modesto header off a deep cross, but Catania hit back after 21 minutes through a scrappy penalty area {{scramble}} that ended <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>neat</b> yet simple finish for Sergio Bernardo Almirón. Parity was soon gone when Sebastian Giovinco's pass found Jonathan Biabiany {{on the edge of the}} penalty area two minutes later; the Frenchman finished emphatically. On the stroke of half-time, Sergio Floccari doubled Parma's leader after a fine run and an exchange of passes with Giovinco allowed him to finish impressively. However, a Catania penalty 17 minutes from the match's end brought the islanders right back into the game; Fabiano Santacroce was the offending defender and Francesco Lodi stepped up to convert to halve the deficit. The scoring was not finished and Andrea Catellani's close-range volley consigned Parma to a fourth consecutive draw in a familiar second-half slump performance.|$|E

500|$|The 19th-century writer Samuel Lewis {{said that}} the rebuilt church [...] "forms a very good {{specimen}} of the early English style of architecture", adding that it was [...] "effective from its simplicity {{and the absence of}} pretension." [...] He added that the interior had been [...] "fitted up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>neat</b> and appropriate manner, and the details throughout appear to have been carefully studied". A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey says that the [...] "impressive" [...] tower and steeple" [...] form [...] "a landmark visible for many miles." [...] It also comments that rendering on part of the tower and the south wall makes them less attractive than the north wall.|$|E

500|$|Angharad Llwyd, writing before St Ceidio's was rebuilt, {{referred}} to it as a [...] "small edifice" [...] in a [...] "dreary spot". The 19th-century writer Samuel Lewis, describing the rebuilt church, was more complimentary: [...] "The expense of the re-edification was very moderate; the ancient foundations were preserved, the same stones were used, and though the present building is a much better one than the former, its style is strictly the same." [...] However, he too thought that the church was in a [...] "dreary spot". The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited the church in 1851.

Grey's relationship with Cristina Yang, has been looked upon as [...] "sisterhood", and Yang has repeatedly referred to Grey as [...] "her person". This led to the two being dubbed [...] "the twisted sisters".

500|$|In September 2011, Delia is {{rushed to}} {{hospital}} after spiking a high temperature of 105, {{where she is}} diagnosed with leukemia, devastating Chloe. SoapNet noted that [...] "Chloe's world is turned upside down" [...] {{as a result of}} the diagnosis. The leukemia storyline spans into January 2012. Hendrickson was happy with the storyline, stating that [...] "it was my supporting actors who supported me through the entire shooting day, and the writing. It was just all wrapped up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>neat</b> little package. I could not ask for a better show." [...] Delia needs a bone marrow transplant to survive. Billy is being forced away from town by his wife's father Victor Newman (Eric Braeden). Victor arranges for Billy to secretly be able to donate his bone marrow, saving Delia's life, though he passes the donation off as Kevin's. Hendrickson praised the writing for the storyline as a [...] "full arc" [...] which had a [...] "beginning, middle and an end". She said, [...] "It was a great story. I got to show a lot of range, and also got to work with some great supporting actors who were in those scenes." [...] For the 39th Daytime Emmy Awards, Hendrickson submitted the scenes in which Chloe is informed of Delia's leukemia, which allowed her to receive a nomination in the category of Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. In July 2013, Delia has a health scare. In light of Chloe's marriage to Kevin ending and Billy experiencing troubles in his marriage to Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle), Jamey Giddens of Zap2it observed that this could act as a catalyst towards a [...] "Chilly" [...] (Chloe and Billy) reunion, writing, [...] "The perfect storm of two failing marriages and a sick child seems to be conjuring up the right elements for some Chilly weather in Genoa City." ...|$|E

2500|$|Within the {{discipline}} of historical archaeology, specifically within the United States, landscape archaeology initially gained prominence with efforts to preserve the homes and gardens of prominent North American figures (see George Washington's Mount Vernon and Thomas Jefferson's Monticello), the reconstruction of early colonial settlements (see Colonial Williamsburg) and the analysis of gardens (see Annapolis). Archaeologists studying the aforementioned, and other colonial sites throughout the United States, have excavated the gardens of wealthy {{men and women in}} order to reconstruct and ascertain the function of these gardens in colonial life. Scholars analyzing the colonial gardens have noticed that gardens were designed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>neat</b> and orderly fashion, displaying symmetry and inspired by Baroque and Renaissance styles (this style is often described as indicative of a [...] "Georgian Worldview" [...] that became popular during the 17th and 18th centuries). Many interpretations have been advanced to explain the function of these gardens. Beginning in the mid-1700s, wealthy elites began to construct large, stately homes and neat, ordered gardens with the guise of mapping superiority and exclusive knowledge onto the landscape. [...] Although the Baroque and Renaissance styles were out of date by the time elites in the United States employed them, this was intentionally done to communicate a knowledge and appreciation of British history that few within the community would have access to. [...] Archaeologists have concluded that the symmetrical, geometric, designs of garden-scapes adopted by colonists in the mid eighteenth to nineteenth centuries made use of [...] "...converging and diverging lines of sight to manipulate the relationship between distance and focal point", making objects appear larger or further away than they really were. [...] These optical illusions functioned to transform the home into a readily identifiable status symbol, and to mark the owners and occupants of these homes as socially distinct from others within the colonial community. [...] Stately homes and gardens constructed by the colonial elite also served to assert authority and to naturalize a social hierarchy onto the colonial landscape. [...] Such analysis and interpretations are neo-marxist in its approach to the understanding and interpreting landscapes of the past.|$|E
2500|$|Lee's assault at 7 p.m. was {{conducted}} by 16 brigades, about 32,100 men. Porter had about 34,000 men to defend the line, {{but many of these}} were worn out from the previous attacks and command cohesion was hampered by feeding isolated reinforcements into the line to fill gaps. Nevertheless, they had the advantages of good defensible terrain and superiority in artillery. The Confederates were not able to advance simultaneously <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>neat</b> battle line over the 2.25-mile front, but rushed forward and were repulsed intermittently in smaller unit actions. On the Confederate left, D.H. Hill sent in his entire division except for Ripley's brigade, which had been badly mauled in the fighting at Beaver Dam Creek the previous day, but they encountered stiff resistance from George Sykes's regulars. The 20th North Carolina succeeded in overrunning a Union battery, its commander, Col. Alfred Iverson, who would later gain infamy at Gettysburg, was wounded in the assault. Meanwhile, the 5th Alabama's commander, Col. Charles Peuges, was mortally wounded and the regiment's colors captured by the 5th Maine. In the center, the Georgians of Brig. Gen. Alexander R. Lawton's brigade were in their first battle. They pushed forward {{with the assistance of the}} Stonewall Brigade of Winder's division, along with Col. Samuel V. Fulkerson's brigade and Elzey's and Trimble's of Ewell's division. Jackson's third brigade, temporarily commanded by Lt. Col Richard H. Cunningham while Brig. Gen John R. Jones was ill, was held in reserve and did not participate in the fighting. Arnold Elzey was shot in the head, an injury that permanently removed him from active field command in the war and Col. James A. Walker of the 13th Virginia assumed command of Elzey's brigade. Samuel Fulkerson was shot in the chest and succumbed to his wound the next day. Col. Edward T.H. Warren of the 10th Virginia took command of the brigade. The Confederate right was opposed by the most difficult terrain, a quarter-mile open wheat field that sloped down to Boatswain's Swamp and then faced two lines of Union defenders on higher ground. James Longstreet ordered Pickett's brigade back into the action, supported by the brigades of Roger Pryor and Cadmus Wilcox, the other three brigades in the division being held in reserve. Longstreet wrote in his report, [...] "I was, in fact, in the position from which the enemy wished us to attack him." ...|$|E
