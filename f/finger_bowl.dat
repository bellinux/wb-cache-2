After the defeat of the Jacobites and the exile overseas of Bonnie Prince Charlie, Jacobite Scots would stand for the loyal toast to [...] "the King" [...] but pass their drink over a glass or jug of water on the table symbolising [...] "the king over the water" [...] instead of the British monarch, as a sign of solidarity with the Jacobite cause and a protest against the Hanoverian succession. Because of this for many years <b>finger</b> <b>bowls</b> were not used on British royal tables, as some people would pass the glass over the bowl.

5000|$|A <b>finger</b> <b>bowl</b> is a bowl {{of water}} used for rinsing one's fingers after the last course of a formal meal served Ã  la russe. It is {{typically}} brought to {{the table at the}} time of the dessert course, arriving atop the dessert plate, with a linen doily between the plate and the bowl and with the dessert fork and spoon on the plate. If a separate fruit course is to follow dessert, the <b>finger</b> <b>bowl</b> should be brought in at that time, with the fruit fork and knife. Alternatively, a full array of dishes can be brought out at once, with the <b>finger</b> <b>bowl</b> atop the dessert plate with its fork and spoon, and the dessert plate atop the fruit plate, with doilies between each dish; in this type of service, the fruit fork and knife are brought out after the dessert plates and silver are cleared. [...] "Where there are plenty of servants, the <b>finger</b> <b>bowl</b> may not come in on the fruit plate but may be brought on its own serving plate, replacing the used fruit plate before the guests leave the table for coffee." [...] A glass ornament, flower, flower petals, lemon slice, sprig of mint or other decoration is often floated in it.|$|E
5000|$|In a form {{of service}} {{commonly}} seen in the early 21st century, guests use the <b>finger</b> <b>bowl</b> before dessert and fruit, rather than after. This innovation, possibly resulting from ignorance of correct usage, is of unknown and apparently recent origin.|$|E
50|$|Directly before dessert, {{everything}} {{is removed from}} the place settings except the wine and water glasses. Crumbs are cleared. The dessert plate is then brought out with a doily on top of it, a <b>finger</b> <b>bowl</b> on top of that, and a fork and spoon, the former balanced {{on the left side of}} the plate and the latter on the right. Guests remove the doily and finger bowls, move them to the left of the plate and place the fork to the left side of the plate and the spoon to its right. Guests do not actually need to use the <b>finger</b> <b>bowl,</b> since they may have not used their fingers to eat with, unless they also had bread with the meal.|$|E

5000|$|The {{decline of}} the <b>finger</b> <b>bowl</b> in American {{restaurants}} {{was due to the}} war effort during World War I when everyone was encouraged to minimize excess.

5000|$|In {{its most}} common form, the course {{begins with the}} {{delivery}} of the dessert or fruit plate with <b>finger</b> <b>bowl</b> and silverware, as one unit. [...] "This {{is the only time}} during a formal meal that a guest takes part in placing the appointments for a course"; that is, they are responsible for moving the dessert silverware to the sides of the dessert plate, and removing the <b>finger</b> <b>bowl</b> (together with the doily) to the upper left of the plate. The bowl is [...] "less than half" [...] or as much as [...] "three-quarters" [...] filled with water. After dessert (or after the fruit, if it is offered as a separate course), guests lightly dip their fingertips into the water, one hand at a time, and then wipe them on the napkin in their lap.|$|E
5000|$|Doilies figure {{prominently}} in the custom of finger bowls, once common in formal, multi-course dinners. The linen doily (never paper) separates the dessert plate from the <b>finger</b> <b>bowl.</b> The custom requires that both doily and <b>finger</b> <b>bowl</b> are removed to the upper left of the place setting before briefly dipping fingertips {{into the water and}} drying them on the napkin. Failing to move both together is a faux pas. [...] Disposable paper doilies [...] "were designed as a cheaper but respectable alternative to crocheted linen doilies" [...] and are commonly used to decorate plates, placed under the food for ornamentation. In the UK, [...] "sales rocketed in the 1950s as a reaction to post-war austerity and the doily quickly became a symbol of upward social mobility." [...] However, the UK is currently experiencing a decline, prompting a [...] "Save our Doilies" [...] campaign. Once [...] "a symbol of suburban gentility" [...] they are now perceived as outdated.|$|E
2500|$|Off spin {{is a type}} of <b>Finger</b> spin <b>bowling</b> in {{the sport}} of cricket. A bowler who uses this {{technique}} is called an off spinner. Off spinners are right-handed spin bowlers who use their fingers to spin the ball from a right-handed batsman's off side to the leg side (that is, towards the right-handed batsman, or away from a left-handed batsman). [...] This contrasts with leg spin, in which the ball spins from leg to off and which is bowled with a very different action.|$|R
40|$|J. falcata, an unselective {{suspension}} feeder, was {{cultivated in}} standing, unaerated <b>finger</b> <b>bowls,</b> feeding on amixture of Brachionus plicatilis, Scrippsiella faeroense, Ulva sp., and natural detritus. This amphipod {{can also be}} maintained with diets composed of dead or live material of both plant and animal origin, but an addition ofliving zooplankton is necessary for long-term cultivation. Starvation resistance is higher in females than inmales, and it is increased by lower temperatures. The life span of J. falcata increases with decreasing temperature, and it is generally higher in females (maximum: 252 days at 10 Â°C) than in males. In laboratory culture, a bimodal mortality pattern is typical with high juvenile death rates, low mortality during thereproductive phase, and again increasingly high death rates {{toward the end of}} the life cycle. Growth rate depends on temperature, sex, and individual age. The temperature dependence of growth is particularly high inmales, and it is higher in adults than in juveniles. The total number of moults is lower in males (5 to 6) than infemales (7 to 9). Sexual maturity is attained at moult IV to V. The average incubation time of eggs is about 9 to 16 days (highest value at 10 Â°C). Three to 4 broods were observed, with largest numbers of offspring at 10 Â°C...|$|R
5000|$|Since 2002, the Highland Bowl {{has been}} {{the crown jewel of}} Aspen Highlands. Most of the terrain is {{accessed}} only by hiking from the top of Loge Peak, although a snowcat can cut the distance by a third. Including the hike-to terrain in Highland Bowl, Highlands' skiable vertical descent increases to 4342 ft. The Highlands ski patrol monitors the Bowl and conducts avalanche control for skier safety. The Bowl faces primarily east, towards Aspen Mountain. Generally, the best snow to be found is in the north-facing G-Zones ("G" [...] corresponds to green ski wax, for the coldest temperature snow). The B-Zones (for blue wax) face east and descend {{down the center of the}} bowl from the 12382 ft summit of Highland Peak. The south-facing Y-Zones (yellow wax), are the steepest, with slopes as steep as 48 degrees, according to Aspen Highlands trail maps. These can be skied without hiking if one rides the snowcat. Prior to the construction of the Deep Temerity lift in 2005, a run down the Highland Bowl required then taking the Grand Traverse, a long, flat catwalk, to get back to the Loge Peak lift. The Highland Bowl also offers access from the summit into the steep and highly avalanche prone backcountry Five <b>Fingers</b> <b>Bowl.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{causeway}} extends {{south and}} {{to the west of}} Group B and ends at a causeway terminus structure (Mound 190). Here hundreds of broken vessels were found in front of the stairway, possibly from a termination ritual. Mound 190 had deposits with finger bones, an altar, and intact mini ceramic vessels below it with tiny specks of jade. This mound also contains evidence of ritual activity and is believed to be used for ritual/ceremonial purposes. The discovery of finger bones is similar to the <b>finger</b> <b>bowl</b> caches associated with Caracol (and also found at Cahal Pech) and may provide evidence of Caracol control or influence at Baking Pot at the time. Vessel 2 at Baking Pot describes its owner in a similar structure that is found at Caracol as well.

50|$|Traditionally, <b>finger</b> spinners <b>bowled</b> with an {{emphasis}} on side spin. With the advent of covered and better batting pitches the focus changed to bowling with a component of top spin. The top spin provides loop which makes it harder for the batsman to make an early judgement of the length of the delivery. The ball tends to be released with a slightly upward trajectory which raises the ball above the batsman's eye line. The topspin on the ball then causes the ball to dip earlier and bounce higher.|$|R

40|$|The {{life cycle}} of the gammarid amphipod Eriopisa chilkensis Chilton from the Cochin estuary, south west coast of India was studied {{for the first time}} under {{laboratory}} conditions. Amphipods especially gammarids are known as potential live feed in fish culture and this forms the base of our study. E. chilkensis can withstand wide variations in salinity (5 - 35) and temperature (27. 5 - 34 Â°C) of the medium. It was cultured in unaerated <b>finger</b> <b>bowls</b> using dried algal matter (Chara sp.) as food. Life span of females was found to be higher (maximum: 220 days) than males (maximum: 175 days). Females were iteroparous and attained sexual maturity within 39. 3 Â± 6 days (mean Â± SD), whereas males matured within 26. 5 Â± 5. 6 days. Number of broods in a life span ranged from 4 to 7. The maximum number of juveniles produced in a single brood was 29 and the maximum number of juveniles produced by a single female over a lifetime was 139. The duration of embryonic development was 12 Â± 2. 45 days. Population dynamics of E. chilkensis was studied based on monthly sampling over one year from the mangrove swamps of Puduvypin. It occurred in varying densities in the epifaunal community (21 - 1583 ind. m-). Extrapolation of laboratory data to the field suggests that E. chilkensis in Cochin estuary has a multivoltine life cycle...|$|R
