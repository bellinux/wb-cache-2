5|$|In Ireland, <b>Dál</b> Riata formed part of Ulster, {{ruled by}} Báetán mac Cairill of the <b>Dál</b> Fiatach. The other major {{grouping}} in Ulster were the disunited tribes of the Cruithne, later {{known as the}} <b>Dál</b> nAraidi. The most important Cruithne king in Áedán's time was Fiachnae mac Báetáin. Beyond the kingdom of Ulster, and generally hostile to it, were the various kingdoms and tribes of the Uí Néill and their subjects and allies. Of the Uí Néill kings, Áed mac Ainmuirech of the Cenél Conaill, Columba's first cousin once removed, {{was the most important}} during Áedán's reign.|$|E
5|$|In the 730s, Óengus {{fought against}} <b>Dál</b> Riata whose {{traditional}} overlords and protectors in Ireland, the Cenél Conaill, were much weakened at this time. A fleet from <b>Dál</b> Riata fought for Flaithbertach mac Loingsig, {{chief of the}} Cenél Conaill, in his war with Áed Allán of the Cenél nEógan, and suffered heavy losses in 733. <b>Dál</b> Riata was ruled by Eochaid mac Echdach of the Cenél nGabráin who died in 733, and the king lists are unclear as to who, if anyone, succeeded him as overking. The Cenél Loairn of north Argyll were ruled by Dúngal mac Selbaig whom Eochaid had deposed as overking of <b>Dál</b> Riata in the 720s.|$|E

5|$|To the {{south-west}} of Pictland {{were the}} Gaels of <b>Dál</b> Riata where the kingship was disputed between the Cenél Loairn of northern Argyll and the Cenél nGabráin of Kintyre. In 723 Selbach mac Ferchair abdicated {{as head of}} the Cenél Loairn and king of <b>Dál</b> Riata in favour of his son Dúngal, who was driven out as king of <b>Dál</b> Riata by Eochaid mac Echdach of the Cenél nGabráin in 726. Dúngal and Eochaid were still in conflict as late as 731, when Dúngal burnt Tarbert.|$|E
5|$|Edwin's {{expansion}} to {{the west}} may have begun early in his reign. There is firm evidence of a war waged in the early 620s between Edwin and Fiachnae mac Báetáin of the <b>Dál</b> nAraidi, king of the Ulaid in Ireland. A lost poem {{is known to have}} existed recounting Fiachnae's campaigns against the Saxons, and the Irish annals report the siege, or the storming, of Bamburgh in Bernicia in 623–624. This should presumably be placed in the context of Edwin's designs on the Isle of Man, a target of Ulaid ambitions. Fiachnae's death in 626, at the hands of his namesake, Fiachnae mac Demmáin of the <b>Dál</b> Fiatach, and the second Fiachnae's death a year later in battle against the <b>Dál</b> Riata probably eased the way for Edwin's conquests in the Irish sea province.|$|E

Pinnock was sometime Speaker of the Jamaican House of Assembly in Kingston, his grandfather {{having been a}} Quaker from Reading who had emigrated to Barbadoes before 1658. Elizabeth <b>Dalling</b> and their daughter Elizabeth Windham <b>Dalling</b> (1763-1.5.1768) died within nine weeks of each other. In 1770 <b>Dalling</b> remarried Louisa, (died 1824), {{daughter of}} Excelles Lawford, of Burwood, Surrey. Their eldest surviving son Sir William Windham <b>Dalling,</b> 2nd Baronet, of Earsham, Norfolk (inherited 1810), and 17 Lower Berkeley Street, Mayfair, died in 1864, aged 89, having been High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1819 and been awarded compensation as owner of the Donnington Castle sugar estate, in parish of St. Mary, Jamaica, which in its day had brought an annual income of £5,000 to £6,000, in the 1830s.|$|R

5|$|The Gaelic overkingdom of <b>Dál</b> Riata was on {{the western}} coast of modern Scotland, with some {{territory}} on the northern coasts of Ireland. It probably ruled from the fortress of Dunadd, now near Kilmartin in Argyll and Bute. In the late 6th and early 7th centuries, it encompassed roughly what is now Argyll and Bute and Lochaber in Scotland, and also County Antrim in Ireland. <b>Dál</b> Riata is commonly viewed as having been an Irish Gaelic colony in Scotland, although some archaeologists have recently argued against this. The inhabitants of <b>Dál</b> Riata are {{often referred to as}} Scots, from Latin scotti, a name used by Latin writers for the inhabitants of Ireland. Its original meaning is uncertain, but it later refers to Gaelic-speakers, whether from Ireland or elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The first written {{records of}} native {{life in the}} Hebrides begin in the 6th century AD with the {{founding}} of the kingdom of <b>Dál</b> Riata. Much of what is known of these times is the product of the monastic sites such as Iona, Lismore, Eigg and Tiree but north of <b>Dál</b> Riata, where the Inner and Outer Hebrides were nominally under Pictish control, the historical record is sparse.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} of the Gaelic kingdoms of <b>Dál</b> Riata in western Scotland is uncertain. No kings are known by name after Áed mac Boanta. The Frankish Annales Bertiniani may record the conquest of the Inner Hebrides, the seaward part of <b>Dál</b> Riata, by Northmen in 849. In addition to these, the arrival of new groups of Vikings from northern and western Europe was still commonplace. Whether there were Viking or Norse-Gael kingdoms in the Western Isles or the Northern Isles at this time is debated.|$|E

The soldiers had been members of the <b>Daled</b> Company of the Palmach's Harel Brigade, and was initially named Peled (an acronym for Plugot <b>Daled,</b> lit. <b>Daled</b> Company). It was later renamed after the 35 Haganah soldiers killed in a convoy to resupply the Gush Etzion kibbutzim during the 1947-48 Civil War (Lamed-Heh is 35 in Hebrew numerals).|$|R

5|$|Áedán was {{the chief}} king in <b>Dál</b> Riata, ruling over lesser tribal kings. The Senchus fer n-Alban records the sub-divisions of <b>Dál</b> Riata in the 7th and 8th centuries, but no record from Áedán's time survives. According to the Senchus, <b>Dál</b> Riata was divided into three sub-kingdoms in the 7th century, each ruled by a kin group named for their eponymous founder. These were the Cenél nGabráin, named for Áedán's father, who ruled over Kintyre, Cowal and Bute; the Cenél Loairn of {{northern}} Argyll; and the Cenél nÓengusa of Islay. Within these there were smaller divisions or tribes which are named by the Senchus. Details of the Irish part of the kingdom are less clear.|$|E
5|$|During the 2nd century AD Irish {{influence}} {{was at work}} in the region and by the 6th century the kingdom of <b>Dál</b> Riata was established. Unlike the P-Celtic speaking Brythons, these Gaels spoke a form of Gaelic that still survives in the Hebrides. Through the efforts of Saint Ninian and others Christianity slowly supplanted Druidism. <b>Dál</b> Riata flourished from the time of Fergus Mór in the late fifth century until the Viking incursions that commenced in the late eighth century. Islands close to the shores of modern Ayrshire would have remained part of the Kingdom of Strathclyde during this period, whilst the main islands became part of the emerging Kingdom of Alba founded by Kenneth MacAlpin (Cináed mac Ailpín).|$|E

5|$|In 563, {{a mission}} from Ireland under St. Columba founded the monastery of Iona off {{the west coast}} of Scotland, and {{probably}} began the conversion of the region to Christianity. The kingdom reached its height under Áedán mac Gabráin (r. 574–608), but its expansion was checked at the Battle of Degsastan in 603 by Æthelfrith of Northumbria. Serious defeats in Ireland and Scotland in the time of Domnall Brecc (d.642) ended <b>Dál</b> Riata's golden age, and the kingdom became a client of Northumbria, then a subject to the Picts. There is disagreement over the fate of the kingdom from the late 8th century onwards. Some scholars argue that <b>Dál</b> Riata underwent a revival under king Áed Find (736–78), before the arrival of the Vikings.|$|E
5|$|In the 7th century, the Picts {{acquired}} Bridei map Beli (671–693) as a king, perhaps {{imposed by}} the kingdom of Alt Clut, where his father Beli I and then his brother Eugein I ruled. At this point the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Bernicia was expanding northwards, and the Picts were probably tributary to them until, in 685, Bridei defeated them at the Battle of Dunnichen in Angus, killing their king, Ecgfrith. In the reign of Óengus mac Fergusa (729–761), the Picts appear to have reached the height of their influence, defeating the forces of <b>Dál</b> Riata (and probably making them a tributary), invading Alt Clut and Northumbria, and making the first known peace treaties with the English. Succeeding Pictish kings may {{have been able to}} dominate <b>Dál</b> Riata, with Caustantín mac Fergusa (793–820) perhaps placing his son Domnall on the throne from 811.|$|E
5|$|Latin sources often {{referred}} to the inhabitants of <b>Dál</b> Riata as Scots (Scoti), a name originally used by Roman and Greek writers for the Irish who raided Roman Britain. Later, it came to refer to Gaelic-speakers, whether from Ireland or elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|The 2008 {{attacks on}} Christians in {{southern}} Karnataka {{refer to the}} wave of attacks directed against Christian churches and prayer halls in the Indian city of Mangalore {{and the surrounding area}} of southern Karnataka in September and October 2008 by Hindu extremist organisations, Bajrang <b>Dal</b> and the Sri Ram Sena. The attacks were widely perceived by Christians in southern Karnataka to be punishment from right-wing Hindu nationalist organisations because they had been outspoken about Christian persecution in Orissa, after the assassination of Hindu monk Swami Lakshmanananda Saraswati allegedly by local christian community and also because the New Life Fellowship Trust (NLFT), a non-denominational Christian Church, was alleged by Bajrang <b>Dal</b> to be responsible for forced conversions of Hindus to Christianity.|$|E
