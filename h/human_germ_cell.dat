40|$|Human {{infertility}} {{is common}} and frequently linked to poor germ cell development. Yet, <b>human</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development is poorly understood, {{at least in}} part due to the inaccessibility of germ cells to study especially during fetal development. Here, we explored the function of a highly conserved family of genes, the NANOS genes, in the differentiation of human germ cells from human embryonic stem cells. We observed that NANOS- 1, - 2 and - 3 mRNAs and proteins were expressed in human gonads. We also noted that NANOS 3 was expressed in germ cells throughout spermatogenesis and oogenesis and thus, focused further efforts on this family member. NANOS 3 expression was highest in <b>human</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> nuclei where the protein co-localized with chromosomal DNA during mitosis/meiosis. Reduced expression of NANOS 3 (via morpholinos or short hairpin RNA) resulted in a reduction in germ cell numbers and decreased expression of germ cell-intrinsic genes required for the maintenance of pluripotency and meiotic initiation and progression. These data provide the first direct experimental evidence that NANOS 3 functions in <b>human</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development; indeed, NANOS 3 is now one of just two genes that has been directly shown to function in germ cell development across diverse species from flies, worms, frogs and mice to humans [the other is BOULE, a member of the Deleted in Azoospermia (DAZ) gene family].

Due to the common somatic origin of gonads and adrenal cortex, we investigated whether ectopic <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> {{were present in the}} <b>human</b> adrenals. <b>Germ</b> <b>cells</b> expressing DDX 4 and/or POU 5 F 1 were present in male and female human adrenals in the first and second trimester.

40|$|The current {{understanding}} of <b>human</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development is limited {{and is at}} most parts extrapolated from studies of mice or other model organisms. Particularly, the specification events of <b>human</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> lineage are largely unknown, which is {{at least in part}} due to inaccessibility of early stages of human development. In addition, debate on the existence of oogonial stem cells (OSCs) in adult ovaries further indicate that more research is needed in order to elucidate <b>human</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development. Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), offer a promising in vitro strategy to study fundamental questions regarding <b>human</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development and to model genetically caused infertility. In this thesis, we used human PSCs to elucidate the genetic requirements of <b>human</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development. Specifically, we assessed the potential of human iPSCs to differentiate to pre- meiotic and post-meiotic germ cells, studied the function of germ cell specific NANOS 3 and Deleted in azoospermia like (DAZL) proteins via over expression in hESCs, and optimized clinically relevant iPSC reprogramming conditions for the derivation of patient specific iPSCs from fibroblasts of infertile Klinefelter syndrome (KS) patients. Furthermore, we studied the existence of OSCs by isolating and characterizing cells from adult human and mouse ovaries. We found that human iPSCs derived from fetal- and adult somatic cells could differentiate to pre-meiotic germ cells with similar or higher efficiency relative to hESCs. Furthermore, in response to the over expression of intrinsic meiotic regulators, we observed that like hESCs, iPSCs formed meiotic and post-meiotic haploid cells. In addition, we identified several candidate genes for NANOS 3 and DAZL mediated functions by over expression in hESCs. We found that human NANOS 3 may have a conserved role in suppression of differentiation and inhibition of apoptosis, and DAZL in induction of germ cell differentiation and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, we identified a possible new role of DAZL in inhibition of cell migration. For optimizing clinically relevant iPSC reprogramming conditions, we achieved efficient reprogramming using xeno-free and chemically defined laminin- 521 and NutriStem medium, and derived KS patient specific iPSCs. Finally, we contradicted the previous study of OSCs by showing that the reported DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) -box polypeptide 4 (DDX 4) antibody –based isolation of OSCs did not select for DDX 4 expressing cells from adult human or mouse ovaries, and the isolated cells were not functional OSCs. In conclusion, human PSCs have an enormous potential to elucidate the complex mechanisms of <b>human</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development, and may ultimately contribute to new strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of infertility in years to come. In addition, we found no evidence for the existence of OSCs in adult human ovaries, thus, supporting the central dogma of fixed ovarian reserve...|$|E
40|$|SummaryMechanisms {{underlying}} <b>human</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> {{development are}} unclear, {{partly due to}} difficulties in studying human embryos and lack of suitable experimental systems. Here, we show that human {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (hiPSCs) differentiate into incipient mesoderm-like cells (iMeLCs), which robustly generate human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) that can be purified using the surface markers EpCAM and INTEGRINα 6. The transcriptomes of hPGCLCs and primordial germ cells (PGCs) isolated from non-human primates are similar, and although specification of hPGCLCs and mouse PGCs rely on similar signaling pathways, hPGCLC specification transcriptionally activates germline fate without transiently inducing eminent somatic programs. This includes genes important for naive pluripotency and repression of key epigenetic modifiers, concomitant with epigenetic reprogramming. Accordingly, BLIMP 1, which represses somatic programs in mice, activates and stabilizes a germline transcriptional circuit and represses a default neuronal differentiation program.

Malignant endodermal cells within YSTs express α-fetoprotein, which can be detected in tumor tissue or serum. However, additional markers of endoderm differentiation would be beneficial for the classification of these tumors. Transcription factor GATA- 4 regulates the differentiation and function of murine yolk sac endoderm, and its expression correlates with proliferation and cell survival in certain tissues. To see whether GATA- 4 plays a role in human YSTs, we surveyed its expression in <b>human</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors and cell lines.

The technology from somatic cell studies is available or adaptable to sperm studies. Sperm samples lend themselves to automated analyses because they are a homogeneous cell population. By flow cytometry or image analysis, large cell samples can be studied per individual. Animal experiments could be conducted in the actual range of chronic human exposure to low doses.

In this review, we describe the current approaches for obtaining germ cells from pluripotent stem cells, and provide basic information about induction of pluripotency and germ cell development...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{a number of}} sketches concerning the main morphological ultrastructural features of the <b>human</b> female <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> during the prenatal period. The morphodynamic outline of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> has been traced, both in their extraembryonic site of origin and during their migration towards the developing ovary. After gonadal settlement, the intraovarian differentiation of the <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> into primary oocytes through the stage of oogonia, {{as well as the}} dramatic fall in the number of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> before birth, is described. The presence of morphofunctionally relevant interactions between the differentiating female gamete and the surrounding somatic microenvironment has also been evaluated and discussed.

40|$|The altered {{expression}} of the SOX 2 transcription factor is associated with oncogenic or tumor suppressor functions in human cancers. This factor regulates the migration and invasion of different cancer cells. In this study we investigated the effect of constitutive SOX 2 overexpression on the migration and adhesion capacity of embryonal teratocarcinoma NT 2 /D 1 cells derived from a metastasis of a <b>human</b> testicular <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumor. We detected that increased SOX 2 expression changed the speed, mode and path of cell migration, but not the adhesion ability of NT 2 /D 1 cells. Additionally, we demonstrated that SOX 2 overexpression increased the {{expression of the}} tumor suppressor protein p 53 and the HDM 2 oncogene. Our results contribute to the better understanding of the effect of SOX 2 on the behavior of tumor cells originating from a <b>human</b> testicular <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumor. Considering that NT 2 /D 1 cells resemble cancer stem cells in many features, our results could contribute to the elucidation of the role of SOX 2 in cancer stem cells behavior and the process of metastasis...|$|R
40|$|Somatic X dosage {{compensation}} requires two mechanisms: X inactivation balances X gene output between males (XY) and females (XX), while X upregulation, hypothesized by Ohno and documented in vivo, balances X gene with autosomal gene output. Whether X {{dosage compensation}} occurs in <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> is unclear. We show that mouse and <b>human</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> exhibit non-canonical X dosage states {{that differ from}} the soma and between the sexes. Prior to genome-wide reprogramming, X upregulation is present, consistent with Ohno's hypothesis. Subsequently, however, it is erased. In females, erasure follows loss of X inactivation, causing X dosage excess. Conversely, in males, erasure leads to permanent X dosage decompensation. Sex chromosomally abnormal models exhibit a “sex-reversed” X dosage state: XX males, like XX females, develop X dosage excess, while XO females, like XY males, develop X dosage decompensation. Thus, germline X dosage compensation states are determined by X chromosome number, not phenotypic sex. These unexpected differences in X dosage compensation states between germline and soma offer unique perspectives on sex chromosome infertility...|$|R
40|$|We have {{employed}} an irradiation and fusion procedure to generate somatic cell hybrids containing various {{fragments of the}} short arm of human chromosome 12 using a 12 p-only hybrid (M 28) as starting material. For the initial identification of hybrids retaining human DNA, nonradioactive in situ hybridization was performed. Seventeen cell lines appeared to contain detectable amounts of human material. Detailed characterization of these hybrids by Southern blot analysis and chromosomal in situ suppression hybridization (chromosome painting), using hybrid DNAs as probes after Alu element-mediated PCR, resulted in a hybrid panel encompassing the entire chromosome 12 p arm. This panel will provide a valuable resource for the rapid isolation of region-specific DNA markers. In addition, this panel may be useful for the characterization of chromosome 12 aberrations in, e. g., <b>human</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} {{fraction of}} Alu repeats in human sperm DNA, previously {{found to be}} unmethylated, is nearly completely methylated in DNA from many somatic tissues. A similar fraction of unmethylated Alus is observed here in sperm DNA from rhesus monkey. However, Alus are almost completely methylated at the restriction sites tested in monkey follicular oocyte DNA. The Alu methylation patterns in mature male and female monkey germ cells are consistent with Alu methylation in <b>human</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors. Alu sequences are hypomethylated in seminoma DNAs and more methylated in a human ovarian dysgerminoma. These results contrast with methylation patterns reported for germ cell single-copy, CpG island, satellite, and L 1 sequences. The function of Alu repeats is not known, but differential methylation of Alu repeats in {{the male and female}} germ lines suggests that they may serve as markers for genomic imprinting or in maintaining differences in male and female meiosis...|$|E
40|$|A {{diverse group}} of gonadal and extragonadal <b>human</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors (GCT) and GCT-derived cell lines was {{examined}} {{for the presence of}} an i(12 p) marker chromosome and/or other abnormalities involving chromosome 12, especially 12 p, by bicolor double fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). For this purpose three probes, pBS- 12, M 28, and palpha 12 H 8, were used, allowing specific identification of the entire chromosome 12, its short arm, and its pericentromeric region, respectively. The presence of one or more copies of a genuine i(12 p) chromosome could be demonstrated in three GCT of the testis, in one ovarian GCT, in one dysgenetic GCT, and in one extragonadal intracranial GCT. Moreover, additional aberrations involving chromosome 12 were shown to be present not only in i(12 p) minus but also in i(12 p) positive GCT. These data suggest that the occurrence of such aberrations may be a common, although less clearly perceptible and frequent, phenomenon in human GCT...|$|E
40|$|<b>Germ</b> <b>cell</b> {{development}} {{is influenced by}} activin and inhibin, which are produced by Sertoli cells. Activin also affects differentiation of mouse embryonal carcinoma cells, which, to a certain extent, resemble the embryonal carcinoma component of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumours. Therefore, the expression of inhibin/activin subunits, of activin receptors and of the activin-binding protein follistatin was studied in testicular <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumours, using RNAase protection assays. Testicular <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumours of adolescents and adults (TGCTs) and spermatocytic seminomas expressed activin type I and type II receptors (ActRI and ActRII respectively). Seminomas expressed significantly lower levels of ActRIIA (P< 0. 05, Mann-Whitney U-test) {{and higher levels of}} ActRIA (P< 0. 05) and ActRIB (P< 0. 05) compared with non-seminomas. All tumours expressed inhibin beta-subunit transcripts, which are a prerequisite for activin synthesis. Non-seminomas contained significantly higher levels of the inhibin betaA subunit (P< 0. 001) compared with seminomas. No activin betaC subunit transcripts could be demonstrated by RNAase protection. Inhibin alpha-subunit expression was absent in the spermatocytic seminomas, in six out of nine seminomas and in 10 out of 11 non-seminomas. Follistatin was expressed predominantly in non-seminomas and spermatocytic seminomas. This expression of activin type I and type II receptors in combination with expression of inhibin beta-subunits indicates that activin may act as a para- or autocrine factor in the regulation of growth and differentiation of tumours of <b>human</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R

In the primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> (PGC), rounded mitochondria with a pale matrix and small vesicular cristae are disposed near the nucleus and significantly increase in number during PGC migration and set-tlement in the gonadal ridge, where they differentiate into oogonia.

40|$|Telomerase, {{the enzyme}} that {{maintains}} {{the ends of}} linear eukaryotic chromosomes, is active in <b>human</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and in a majority of tumor tissues and immortalized cell lines. In contrast, most mature somatic cells and tissues contain low or undetectable telomerase activity, implying a stringent negative regulatory control mechanism. We report here that telomerase activity is dramatically inhibited during the terminal differen tiation of HL- 60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells to monocytic and granulocytic lineages. A loss of telomerase activity was seen in response to three different inducers of differentiation, was independent of differenti ation-induced apoptosis, and occurred {{in the presence of}} unaltered ex pression of the RNA component of telomerase. Reduction in telomerase activity was also observed during the differentiation of murine F 9 teratocarcinoma and C 2 C 12 myoblast cells.
