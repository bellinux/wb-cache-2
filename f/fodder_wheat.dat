40|$|Little {{is known}} about gaseous carbon (C) and {{nitrogen}} (N) emissions from traditional terrace agriculture in irrigated high mountain agroecosystems of the subtropics. In an effort towards filling this knowledge gap measurements of carbon dioxide (CO_ 2), methane (CH_ 4), ammonia (NH_ 3) and dinitrous oxide (N_ 2 O) were taken with a mobile photoacoustic infrared multi-gas monitor on manure-filled PE-fibre storage bags and on flood-irrigated untilled and tilled fields in three mountain oases of the northen Omani Al Jabal al Akhdar mountains. During typical 9 - 11 day irrigation cycles of March, August and September 2006 soil volumetric moisture contents of fields dominated by <b>fodder</b> <b>wheat,</b> barley, oats and pomegranate ranged from 46 - 23 %. While manure incorporation after application effectively reduced gaseous N losses, prolonged storage of manure in heaps or in PE-fibre bags caused large losses of C and N. Given the large irrigation-related turnover of organic C, sustainable agricultural productivity of oasis agriculture in Oman seems to require the integration of livestock which allows for several applications of manure per year at individual rates of 20 t dry matter ha^− 1...|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of Pakistan crop sector {{was carried out}} covering the 1990 - 2005 period to check whether the sector was technically productive, financially viable and economically efficient and optimal. It started with evaluating the yields of Pakistan's crops relative to the world average yields. The results imply that: (a) Pakistan's crop yields are, in general, not comparable to the world average yields; (b) tomato, barley and sorghum are producing less than 50 % of the world average yields; (c) the yields of lentils, millets, rapeseed/mustard and maize are ranging between 35 - 50 percent lower than the world averages; and (d) the yields of IRRI rice, onion, wheat, sugarcane and gram are 13 - 23 % lower than the world averages. To check financial viability of Pakistan crop sector, net returns from each crop were compared with returns from the banking sector in terms of interest rates. On {{the basis of these}} ratios (NIRR) all crops were categorized into five groups: (a) Basmati rice, IRRI rice, onion and tomato, which appear to have the highest NIRR values> 10 that is, returns are 10 times of the banking sector interest rate; (b) gram, berseem, millet fodder, potato and rapeseed. /mustard, received NIRR values ranging between 5 and 10; (c) wheat, barley and sorghum fodder, having NIRR values between 2 and 5; (d) mung, seed cotton, maize fodder and sugarcane, with the NIRR value between 1 and 2; and (e) maize, millet and sorghum earned NIRR Each of the major crops was tested using optimization technique (optimize output, which in turn minimize total cost). We find that producers of two crops (Basmati rice and potato) optimize their outputs; in 13 cases, crop producers have not been optimizing. In three cases (IRRI rice, maize fodder and millet fodder), the estimated optimal output falls beyond the upper limit of the confidence interval of the existing output level, suggesting that efforts to increase output (yield) per hectare would help. In the remaining 10 sub-optimal cases (seed cotton, sugarcane, maize, onion, mung, sorghum <b>fodder,</b> <b>wheat,</b> gram, berseem and rapeseed), the estimated optimal output falls below the lower limit of the confidence interval, theoretically suggesting that decrease in existing level of output (yield) per hectare would optimize, which is not a reasonably good option as the yields per hectare of these crops are already very low. Hence, efforts should be made to decrease cost of production and increase yield per hectare of these crops simultaneously. When testing the optimality of Pakistan crop sector using Linear Programming (LP), it was found that taking Kharif and Rabi crops separately would give representative results against when these crops were taken as a whole-year planning package. Of the 19 major crops tested for optimality, only 5 crops - Basmati rice, IRRI rice, onion, gram and potato - have emerged as optimal for all times; while another 6 crops - mung, sorghum fodder, millet <b>fodder,</b> <b>wheat,</b> rapeseed/ mustard and berseem - turned out to be optimal but not throughout the study period, indicating optimality of lesser degree relative to other crops. Of the remaining eight crops, six crops - sugarcane, maize, maize fodder, sorghum, millets and barley - have remained altogether sub-optimal throughout the period; one crop - seed cotton - remained suboptimal most of the times and another one - tomato - remained suboptimal for the latest period. Optimality of these crops was further checked for possible effects of globalization and WTO's trade liberalization using the recent 5 -year period (2000 - 05) in our analysis. As far as the five all-time-optimal crops (Basmati rice, IRRI rice, onion, gram and potato) are concerned, these crops are expected to withstand globalization with the exception of gram. Similarly, the six most-of-the-time optimal crops (mung, sorghum fodder, millet <b>fodder,</b> <b>wheat,</b> rapeseed/mustard and berseem) withstand globalization with the exception of mung. Hence, cultivation of gram and mung on large areas may not be viable in the wake of falling prices. As far as six altogether sub-optimal crops (sugarcane, maize and maize fodder, sorghum, millet and barley) are concerned, these crops would not withstand globalization, nor do they appear to be capable of benefiting from WTO trade liberalization induced high prices. Hence price incentives would not be recommended for these crops; instead efforts should be made to improve their optimality through improving technology. Seed cotton and tomato crops do not withstand globalization. WTO trade liberalization induced high prices are expected to work for seed cotton, but not for tomato. Hence, efforts to improve the optimality status of former crop should be made using price incentives as well, while for the latter crop, efforts should concentrate on improving productivity...|$|E

According to our presumption the liquidity defi ciency and the adaptive expectations of exchange market actors has a great impact on the {{operation of}} the Hungarian grain futures market. As a consequence, information affects the grain futures trade in a cumulative way in Hungary, therefore the effi cient market hypothesis does not hold in the case of these markets.

The effectiveness of the linear extrapolation has confi rmed the presumption that the futures trade can be unambiguously characterised with the adaptive expectations of market participants.

40|$|This project {{aimed to}} {{contribute}} to socio-economic development, by establishing a firm foundation for continuing self-help development throughout the Thabana Morena area. Its goal was to promote self-reliance and {{to improve the quality}} of life of the rural poor through increased earnings and employment. The project's original objective, which envisaged the formation of 75 self-help groups (SHGs) with a membership of 1 500, was found to be too ambitious. It was thus scaled down and revised, and by the end of the project some 21 SHGs, with a total membership of 425 households (about 12 of the total population), were in operation. The group economic activities of the project can be broadly grouped into two, those related to agriculture, including livestock and cropping, and those related to cottage industries, where the thrust was towards processing available primary products and related by-products and providing services required for the overall development of the Thabana Morena area. The agricultural income-generating activities were those related to the production of <b>fodder,</b> <b>wheat,</b> vegetables and fruit. Poultry and egg production, fish-cum- duck farming and rabbit breeding schemes were also started. In the cottage industries sector, spinning, knitting and cement block/brick-making SHGs were formed and a bakery was established. The group members received training in simple cost-benefit analyses, financial management, record-keeping, identification of market outlets and price negotiation. When necessary, they were also given technical advice on pest control and on the selection of recommended plant varieties. Project management provided substantial external support to the group beneficiaries, including equipment, assistance with the repair and maintenance of machines and support for credit operations. At times it also subsidized the transportation of raw materials and of products to markets. Efforts were made during the project to prevent environmental degradation. The use of farmyard manure, the establishment of community forests and controlled grazing were strongly advocated, as also the importance of afforestation in terms of wood fuel, prevention of erosion and maintenance of soil water balance. Using the `Food for Work' programme as an incentive, project staff collaborated with the Rural Road Construction Unit to mobilize members of the Thabana Morena community to construct feeder roads that would link villages in the area. Although the project made significant progress in creating village-based participatory groups and awareness among the community of the possibility of self-initiated development, rural development support, in the form of marketing legislation, infrastructure and equipment, was found to be generally weak, with many SHGs operating in a difficult marketing environment. It is therefore recommended that the Government create an environment conducive to rural development by introducing the necessary changes to existing legislation and by providing, through line departments, vitally needed rural development infrastructural support. It should also examine the possibility of import controls in favour of local small-scale producers. In order to consolidate the achievements of the project and to finalize those activities that could not be finished, a period of transition is required, so as to allow a gradual transfer of responsibilities to government line agencies. During this period all external support to project beneficiaries must be scaled down to a level that the Government of Lesotho can provide and will be able to replicate without project support. In future great care should be taken to identify only those income-generating activities that are economically viable and a cost-benefit analysis should be carried out prior to operations. To ensure sustainability, beneficiaries should be adequately trained in the management and implementation of their chosen activities. It would also be advisable to constantly monitor the marketing situation and the progress of new self-help groups...|$|E

40|$|Field and {{glasshouse}} investigations {{were conducted}} on the responses of two legumes (field pea and fodder vetch) and three non-leguminous crops (maize, wheat and rapeseed) to the heavy metals Cd, Cr, Zn, Pb, Cu and Mn in soil with multiple metal contamination. In general, {{the results indicate that}} the two legumes and wheat were more susceptible to soil metals than were rapeseed and maize. The dry matter yields of field pea, <b>wheat,</b> <b>fodder</b> vetch, rapeseed and maize decreased by up to 169, 123, 113, 93 and 68 %, respectively, in metal-contaminated soil. Among the crops, maize had the highest concentrations of Mn, Zn and Cd, rapeseed had the highest concentrations of Cr, the concentration of Cu was highest in <b>fodder</b> vetch, and <b>wheat</b> was the highest accumulator of Pb. The bioconcentration factors (BCF) of the metals decreased as the soil metal loading rates increased except for Cr in fodder vetch and Cd in wheat, whose BCF increased as the metal loading rate increased. Significant linear correlations were found between plant and soil metal concentrations. Patterns of metal distribution in plant parts varied with different crops and metals, with more Cd and Cu accumulating in the grain of wheat than of maize, suggesting that growing wheat would represent a higher risk of food contamination than growing maize in Cd- or Cu-contaminated soil. The results suggest that on sites with multiple metal contamination, growing maize and rapeseed would be safer than growing wheat or legumes. However, maize could perhaps be used for phytoremediation of lightly contaminated soils, providing that the crop residues were safely disposed of...|$|R

Laboratory experiments on wheat samples included moisture and protein content, Hagberg’s falling number, wet gluten content, alveographic values, and microbiological tests. Th e examined winter wheat varieties (‘Magor’, ‘Hunor’, ‘Róna’ and ‘Kondor’) retained their moisture, protein content, and their Hagberg’s falling number aft er storage. A slight increase was observed in wet gluten content for all four winter wheat varieties aft er 129 days of storage. This result proved the theory of after-ripening, as gluten percentage improved both qualitatively and quantitatively. An approximate 10 % increase in quantitative growth was observed for all four winter wheat varieties. We placed a special emphasis on measuring the alveographic W (10 - 4 J) values during storage. All four winter wheat varieties showed decreasing values of about 20 - 40 %. Microbiological examinations on the four winter wheat varieties showed that mould, mould flora and total germ count remained balanced, with some slight variations, and that they did not change in terms of time under optimal storage conditions.

40|$|The {{availability}} {{of corn and}} wheat crop residues was analyzed for each county in Ohio. Results showed that two clusters in western Ohio, each encompassing 17 counties with a collection radius of 50 miles, could provide feedstock for two ethanol plants at a capacity of 5, 000 dry tons per day each. This calculation assumes that 35 % of the corn stover and wheat straw per acre would be removed. These two plants could produce a total of 240 million gallons of ethanol per year. This fact sheet illustrates the process of evaluating where such facilities might be feasible. Naturally, not every acre of corn or wheat residue in a county would be available, nor would every acre have 35 % of the residue removed. World oil prices are the {{major factor in the}} demand for ethanol in the U. S.

This paper presents a preliminary WFA of South Africa (SA) based on data for the period 1996 – 2005. Crop production was found to contribute about 75 % of the total water footprint of national production. The total water footprint of crop production is mainly composed of five crops: maize, <b>fodder</b> crops, sugarcane, <b>wheat</b> and sunflower seed, which account for 83 % of the crop water footprint. The average water footprint of a South African consumer is 1 255 m 3 /yr, below the world average of 1 385 m 3 /yr, and {{is dominated by the}} consumption of meat (32 %) and cereals (29 %). About one fifth of this water footprint of consumption is external to SA. While SA is a net virtual water importer, the virtual water trade analysis revealed that a large share of blue water consumption is related to export. Sustainability concerns are that the major river basins face severe blue-water scarcity for extended periods of the year, and that water pollution levels related to nitrogen and phosphorus were found to be unsustainable in all river basins in SA. Efficient allocation and use of water is investigated by means of comparing the consumptive water footprint to global benchmark values, as well as the economic green- and blue-water productivity and the economic land productivity of the crops cultivated in SA. Furthermore, crops with specific potential for biofuel production are assessed. Lastly, recommendations to address the identified issues are given...|$|R

This mean that the food safety risks can be reduced by Sortex Z+ optical sorting machine. Our experiments proved if there is color sorting in the cleaning process preceding the milling of wheat then a part of the grain of wheat infected by Fusarium sp. can be selected. This improves the food safety parameters of given lot of wheat and decrease the toxin content. The flour made from contaminated grains of wheat can be a serious food safety risk.

40|$|The {{origin and}} {{quantity}} of plant inputs to soil are primary factors controlling the size {{and structure of the}} soil microbial community. The present study aimed to elucidate and quantify the carbon (C) flow from both root and shoot litter residues into soil organic, extractable, microbial and fungal C pools. Using the shift in C stable isotope values associated with replacing C 3 by C 4 plants we followed root- vs. shoot litter-derived C resources into different soil C pools. We established the following treatments: Corn Maize (CM), <b>Fodder</b> Maize (FM), <b>Wheat</b> + maize Litter (WL) and Wheat (W) as reference. The Corn Maize treatment provided root- as well as shoot litter-derived C (without corn cobs) whereas Fodder Maize (FM) provided only root-derived C (aboveground shoot material was removed). Maize shoot litter was applied on the Wheat + maize Litter (WL) plots to trace the incorporation of C 4 litter C into soil microorganisms. Soil samples were taken three times per year (summer, autumn, winter) over two growing seasons. Maize-derived C signal was detectable after three to six months in the following pools: soil organic C (Corg), extractable organic C (EOC), microbial biomass (Cmic) and fungal biomass (ergosterol). In spite of the lower amounts of root- than of shoot litter-derived C inputs, similar amounts were incorporated into each of the C pools in the FM and WL treatments, indicating greater importance of the root- than shoot litter-derived resources for the soil microorganisms as a basis for the belowground food web. In the CM plots twice as much maize-derived C was incorporated into the pools. After two years, maizederived C in the CM treatment contributed 14. 1, 24. 7, 46. 6 and 76. 2 % to Corg, EOC, Cmic and ergosterol pools, respectively. Fungi incorporated maize-derived C {{to a greater extent than}} did total soil microbial biomass...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{changes in}} the {{intensity}} of biological processes in the vegetation and productivity of forage grasses depending {{on the degree of}} soil salinity of the North-West Caspian Lowland were studied. Salination factors are specific. They are formed because of their adaptive nature, providing for species the opportunity to get the certain position in the relevant biocenosis. As a result each species produces its own strategy of life. Development of saline processes of soil in the growth and development of the plant mass, biological and agronomic salt resistance is clearly seen. Biological salt resistance is characterized by the ability to maintain the viability of the plant body at the upper limit of salinity. Agronomical salt resistance is determined by the value of crop and productivity. Adaptive possibilities of different plant species with different biological characteristics were also examined. Subject, objective of the work. Productivity of vegetation of semidesert ecosystems and dynamics under the influence of salinity forage grass pasture phytocenoses of the North-West Caspian Lowland were studied. Test method. We studied <b>fodder</b> crops: <b>wheat</b> grass long (Elytrigia elongata), ctenoid wheatgrass (Agropirum cristatum) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa). The crop from each significant area was weighed; it was taken from the average sample weighed in at 1 kg in a gauze bag for drying at a temperature of 60 – 65 °C in airing cupboard where brought to constant weight. Accounting for phytomass was carried by laying mowing area 8 – 10 times. Dimensions of mowing fields are 0. 25 m 2, that ensured coverage of all dominant plants. Results. At mid-saline meadow-chestnut soil of the North-West Caspian Lowland wheatgrass long gives the highest yield of green mass – 18, 1 tons per hectare of dry weight average for 2003 – 2010. Alfalfa crop is in the second place, that is less than bluegrass by 18. 0 % (2. 9 tons per hectare). The least yield of these crops is ctenoid wheatgrass, which is less than other grasses by 4. 8 tons per hectare (26. 1 %) and 1. 7 tons per hectare (11. 3 %). Therefore, wheatgrass long is hardier to mid-saline soil than other species. High yield of alfalfa depends on frequent mowing of this grass. In the sowing year there were three hay crops, the second and subsequent years - 4 mowing. The share of the first mowing in the sowing year alfalfa has 33. 0 %, the second 42. 3 %, the third 24. 7 %. In the second and subsequent years the share of the first mowing in the total yield of green mass increases up to 28, 3 – 28, 8, the third to 19, 0 – 20, 6, the fourth to 8, 8 – 10, 7 %. Area of application. The research results can be used by the economic organizations and enterprises for the phytomelioration of saline soils. The obtained data can be used to enhance and achieve high productivity of forage grasses and to restore the productivity of saline lands and use them for agricultural purposes. Conclusions. Adaptability to the saline soil and the productivity of forage grasses differ according to biological characteristics and extent soil salinity and ecological conditions. </p...|$|R
40|$|The New Zealand dairy {{industry}} has experienced rapid intensification during recent decades {{in response to}} increasing land values. Incorporating forage crops on the milking platform is a potential strategy to increase dry matter production and milk production for greater profitability. However, in previous studies, intensification has increased the cost of milk production. This has diminished the low-cost competitive advantage that New Zealand dairy producers have had in international markets. Feeding low crude protein forage crops {{has also been shown}} to reduce the nitrogen (N) concentration in cow urine, which may help reduce N leaching. This study used farm system modelling to determine the profitability and N leaching on the 160. 1 ha (effective) Lincoln University Dairy Farm (LUDF) when <b>fodder</b> beet, <b>wheat</b> for feed and sales, and a double crop rotation of maize and oats silage was grown. The cash operating profit was calculated using FARMAX® Professional Dairy, assuming $ 6. 00 /kg MS. The projected N leaching was calculated using Overseer TM (version 6. 2. 0), which is now compulsory for all farms in Canterbury under the Environment Canterbury Land and Water Regional Plan. The only crop scenario that increased profitability was fodder beet. Incorporating 10 ha each of spring and autumn grazed fodder beet increased operating profit by 20. 0 % to $ 4, 782 /ha compared to the existing 100 % pastoral system ($ 3, 984 /ha). The other cropping scenarios had significant decreases in profitability. Incorporating 20 ha of maize and oats silage reduced operating profit by 10. 6 %, despite increased overall dry matter production. This was due to poor feed conversion efficiency (FCE) and increased feed crop expenses. Operating profit reduced by 3. 2 % and 13. 1 % when wheat was grown for feed and sales respectively. The wheat (fed) scenario had similar milk production to the existing scenario, however greater crop expenditure. The wheat (sold) scenario had significantly reduced overall revenue which impacted on profitability. A second simulation with fodder beet was done so than daily intakes were increased to the recommended maximum 6. 0 kg DM/cow/day. Harvested fodder beet was included in the rotation and fed at 4. 0 kg DM/cow/day during mid-lactation when there was no grazed fodder beet available. The total fodder beet area was increased to 33. 9 ha, which increased the operating profit by 34. 8 % to $ 5, 368 /ha. The projected nitrate leaching for the all proposed scenarios increased due to significant nutrient loss from the cropping blocks. The overall N leaching increased from 34 kg N/ha for the existing system to 41 kg N/ha for both the fodder beet (20 ha) and maize/oats silage scenarios. Leaching was 39 and 37 kg N/ha for the wheat (fed) and wheat (sold) scenarios respectively. Leaching increased to 44 kg N/ha when the fodder beet area was increased to 33. 9 ha. It was concluded that fodder beet was the only suitable crop to increase profitability, however the projected increase in N leaching will likely prevent the strategy from being implemented...|$|R
40|$|Borkhar {{district}} {{is located in}} an and to semi-arid region in Iran and regularly faces widespread drought. Given current water scarcity, the limited available water should be used as efficient and productive as possible. To explore on-farm strategies which result in higher economic gains and water productivity RP), a physically based agrohydrological model, Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP), was calibrated and validated using intensive measured data at eight selected farmer fields (<b>wheat,</b> <b>fodder</b> maize, sunflower and sugar beet) in the Borkhar district, Iran during the agricultural year 2004 - 2005. The WP values for the main crops were computed using the SWAP simulated water balance components, i. e. transpiration T, evapotranspiration ET, irrigation 1, and the marketable yield Y-M in terms in terms of YMT- 1, YMET- 1 and YMI- 1. The average WP, expressed as $ T- 1 (US $ m(- 3)) was 0. 19 for wheat, 0. 5 for fodder maize, 0. 06 for sunflower and 0. 38 for sugar beet. This indicated that fodder maize provides the highest economic benefit in the Borkhar irrigation district. Soil evaporation caused the average WP values, expressed as Y-M ET- 1 (kg m(- 3)), to be {{significantly lower than the}} average WP, expressed as Y-M T- 1, i. e. about 27 % for wheat, 11 % for fodder maize, 12 % for sunflower and 0. 18 for sugar beet. Furthermore, due to percolation from root zone and stored moisture content in the root zone, the average WP values, expressed as Y-M I- 1 (kg m(- 3)), had a 24 - 42 % reduction as compared with VIP, expressed as Y-M ET- 1. The results indicated that during the limited water supply period, on-farm strategies like deficit irrigation scheduling and reduction of the cultivated area can result in higher economic gains. Improved irrigation practices in terms of irrigation timing and amount, increased WP in terms of Y-M I- 1 (kg m(- 3)) by a factor of 1. 5 for wheat and maize, 1. 3 for sunflower and 1. 1 for sugar beet. Under water shortage conditions, reduction of the cultivated area yielded higher water productivity values as compared to deficit irrigation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Conservation {{involves}} sustaining {{of biological}} diversity as its main goal. Description of all taxa and their relative abundance {{are the most important}} components of biodiversity conservation within an ecosystem. Lepidoptera {{is one of the largest}} orders of the class Insecta. They are phytophagous as well as pollinators. Parasitoids are the biological control agents cosmopolitan in nature and keep check on caterpillars, by parasitizing them. Identifying and conserving these biological control agents is important as it allows us to rely less on chemicals, and hence reduce their impacts on ecosystems. The Braconidae (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonoidea) is among one of the largest families, being used successfully in biological control programs worldwide. The present study aimed at identifying the relative abundance of some of the braconids and their lepidopteran hosts from the cropland of district Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan. For this purpose, sampling was carried out from four crops, namely <b>wheat,</b> <b>fodder,</b> brassica and vegetables, for one year from June, 2010 to May, 2011. Fodder was the most infested crop, with 37. 28 % of the total lepidopteran specimens, followed by vegetables (36. 25 %), brassica (23. 08 %) and the least being wheat (3. 38 %). A similar trend was observed for braconids, being 31. 90 %, 25. 38 %, 21. 63 % and 21. 08 % for fodder, vegetables, brassica and wheat, respectively. Host-parasitoid associations, helpful in designing biological control programs, were assessed by regression analysis. Pieris brassicae showed the best probable association with Heterospilus spp., Cotesia flavipes and Cotesia vestalis, having R 2 values as 0. 96, 0. 95 and 0. 94, respectively. Quantification of foraging of lepidopteran caterpillars was done to understand suitability of different host plants for cultural control measures. P. brassicae was found to be the most destructive species, with maximum larval duration of 17. 67 Â± 0. 47 days on brassica plants, followed by Helicoverpa armigera 17. 00 Â± 0. 82 days on cauliflower. Trichoplusia ni had maximum larval duration of 14. 3 Â± 0. 47 days on cabbage, and those of Spodoptera exigua had 14. 00 Â± 0. 47 days on cauliflower. The average consumption of all food offered by larvae of P. brassicae, H. armigera, T. ni and S. exigua was calculated as 14. 67 Â± 5. 75 g, 11. 76 Â± 5. 25 g, 10. 75 Â± 5. 25 g and 8. 99 Â± 6. 15 g respectively. Brassica was the preferred crop for P. brassicae, as maximum larval length (36. 45 Â± 0. 05 mm), pupal length (20. 00 Â± 0. 82 mm) and adult length (43. 00 Â± 0. 81 mm) was observed when larvae fed on this crop. Cauliflower was the preferred diet for S. exigua and H. armigera. Both of the species showed maximum size of larvae (35. 4 Â± 0. 00 mm, and 47. 00 Â± 0. 00 mm), pupae (18. 33 Â± 0. 47 mm and 19. 67 Â± 0. 47 mm) and adults (26. 00 Â± 0. 47 mm and 35 Â± 0. 81 mm), respectively, when fed on cauliflower. P. brassicae was found to be a potential host for two species of the genus Cotesia, namely C. vestalis and C flavipes. In the present study Sequence Characterized Amplified Regions (SCARs) could only be developed for species identification of T. ni due to experimental and financial limits. Such types of studies are very helpful in designing biological control programs for assessment and control of economic pests...|$|R
40|$|Iran faces {{widespread}} droughts regularly, causing large economical {{and social}} damages. The agricultural sector is with 80 - 90 % {{by far the}} largest user of water in Iran and is often the first sector to be affected by drought. Unfortunately, water management in agriculture is also rather poor and hence water productivity of crops WP is far below potential. The growing water scarcity due to drought and the increasing water demands of industries, households and environment, are major threats to sustainable agricultural development in Iran. Therefore, the development of a reliable agricultural drought assessment system would be very beneficial for proper operational decision making on farms, for early warning, for identification of potential vulnerability of areas and for mitigation of drought impacts. Given the current water scarcity, the limited available amount of water should be used as efficient as possible. To explore on-farm strategies which result in higher WP-values and thus economic gains, the physically based agrohydrological model Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP), was calibrated and validated using measured data at 8 selected farmer’s fields (<b>wheat,</b> <b>fodder</b> maize, sunflower and sugar beet) in the Borkhar irrigation district in Iran during the agricultural year 2004 - 05. Using the calibrated SWAP model, on-farm strategies i. e. deficit irrigation scheduling, optimal irrigation intervals and extent of cultivated area, were analyzed based on relations between WP- indicators and water consumption. The results showed a large potential of the improvement of water productivity under limited water supply in the Borkhar irrigation district. Although agrohydrological models like SWAP offer the possibilities for predicting crop yield, such models may become inaccurate because of uncertainty of input parameters like irrigation scheduling, soil hydraulic parameters and planting dates. This holds especially true when applying distributed modelling at regional scale. Hence to reduce the uncertainty in application of SWAP at regional scales, remotely sensed data of leaf area index and evapotranspiration were used in combination with a geographical information system. The remotely sensed data were inserted into the distributed SWAP model using data assimilation techniques i. e. sequential updating. Data of LAI were derived from Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR) spectral bands of remote sensing data with moderate to high spatial resolution. However, due to resolution limitations of existing remotely sensed data i. e. thermal bands, these data could not be used directly for routine ET estimation of individual fields. Therefore, a new disaggregation method based on linear disaggregation of ET components within each MODIS pixel, was developed and applied to the simulated MODIS data. The results of the proposed approach were further compared with two other disaggregation approaches being based on weighted ratios, as derived from dividing ET maps of high and low spatial resolution data. The biggest advantage of the proposed linear disaggregation approach was that the number of high spatial resolution images needed in this method is low, i. e. the approach can even be applied using one land cover map only.   As in many regions access to high spatial resolution thermal images is currently not possible, the linear disaggregation method can still be used to assess drought impacts far in advance. Water balance components as computed by SWAP are quite sensitive to the upper boundary conditions, and hence to irrigation times and application depths. In order to know how much water has been applied, the cumulative actual ET data were therefore used in an automatic calibration mode, i. e. inverse modelling of irrigation scheduling. The ability of inverse modelling to reproduce the initial irrigation times and depth, was first investigated using forward cumulative SWAP simulated ET data based on 5, 15 and 30 days. Thereafter, the cumulative disaggregated remotely sensed ET data based on 5 days were used in the inverse modelling process. The results showed that the performance of inverse modelling is promising in identifying the irrigation time and depth of irrigation using 5 days based cumulative ET data. However, irrigation amounts, which rewet the soil profile beyond field capacity and thus cause excessive percolation, could not be detected by the applied inverse modelling approach. Also, assimilation of remotely sensed data into a distributed SWAP by automatic calibration needed a large amount of computation time, especially at regional scale. Hence, to insert the valuable information from remotely sensed land surface data into the SWAP model at regional scale, a simple updating assimilation technique was used. The SWAP model was implemented in a distributed way using the spatial distributed information of soil types, land use and water supply on a raster basis with a grid size of 250 m. In order to link spatial information data with SWAP, a coupling program was written by the author in MATLAB. This program took care of the transfer of in- and output data from one system to the other, as well as to run the model for each pixel. To have a prediction of crop yield far in advance, the sequential updating process of remotely sensed based data (LAI and/or relative evapotranspiration ET/ET p) was halted at one respectively two months {{before the end of the}} wheat growing season. During the sequential updating process known weather data were used, while for the remaining part of the growing season different scenarios were considered based on weather data of a dry, wet and normal year. A value for the optimum gain factor K g, that performed best with respect to the observations, was selected Simulation with assimilation of both LAI and ET/ET p - data at both the regional and field scale (bias about %) was very promising in forecasting crop production one month in advance. However, longer term predictions i. e. two months in advance, resulted in a higher bias between the simulated and statistical data. It appeared that in the assimilation process LAI data have a dominant influence. Because of this dominant influence, it is suggested to repeat the assimilation process using the LAI data of the most advanced satellite i. e. IRS-P 6 (ResourceSAT 1 & 2) with higher spatial and temporal resolution. The surface water in the Borkhar irrigation canal network is provided by diversion of the water from the Zayande Rud river. Since this river is mainly fed by the snow melt from January to April, a comprehensive drought assessment system on seasonal basis can be developed by integration of the developed agricultural drought assessment system with the estimates of available surface water being derived from snow pack and snow cover. ...|$|R
