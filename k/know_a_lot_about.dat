25|$|In 1986, Marlena {{takes in}} John Black as her patient; he has amnesia {{and she is}} {{determined}} to help him recover his past. John and Marlena {{spend a lot of}} time together, and the pair fall in love. However, John seems to <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> Stefano, leading Marlena to suspect he is Stefano. Later, Marlena finds a plastic surgeon's file containing before and after shots of both Roman and John. Marlena becomes convinced that John is Roman, and, over time, John took on the role of Roman. Marlena is later trying to talk down a suicidal jumper when she falls from a window ledge. Marlena lays in a coma, near death for a month. When she finally recovers, she and Roman renewed their vows on August 22, 1986. In his years with the ISA, Roman worked with a man named Orpheus. Roman accidentally killed Orpheus' wife while on assignment. To get back at Roman, Orpheus kidnaps Marlena and fakes her death. Roman shoots and kills Orpheus, but before he could rescue Marlena, she is presumed to have been killed in a plane crash.|$|E

Everybody on the set applauded. I thought they were applauding because they had learned something about supply-side economics.

500|$|Thematically, {{influences}} behind The Operative: No One Lives Forever {{were primarily}} 1960s spy-themed films, novels, television shows, {{as well as}} historical references. When {{it was decided that}} NOLF {{was going to be a}} 1960s spy game, lead designer Craig Hubbard started immersing himself in the subject matter, in order to [...] "develop some fluency" [...] in it. As he explained, he [...] "was a big fan of early Bond films, but didn't <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> the whole spy craze. So I watched the Derek Flint movies , Modesty Blaise, Matt Helm, , Avengers – anything I could get my hands on." [...] Other influences included books, such as The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, TV shows like The Saint, The Pink Panther films, commando movies, such as The Guns of Navarone, as well as [...] "lots of historical references, encompassing everything from books and documentaries on the spy trade to fashion catalogs and interior-design books." [...] The basis for the biological explosives plot was the 1967 film Casino Royale. According to Hubbard, [...] "the idea was to create a game that would make you feel like a superspy, so we tried to come up with situations, characters, and settings to support that goal." [...] During the course of the game, the player can hear explicit popular culture references, including the TV series The Prisoner and The Fugitive, the Matt Helm films The Silencers and The Ambushers, and exotica musicians Les Baxter and Sondi Sodsai. Other conversations allude to major events of the time, such as the studio years of The Beatles, and the commercial failure of the Edsel automobile.|$|E

Tomari is Hazumu's {{childhood}} friend, so the two <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> each other and have many memories from the past. Hazumu would often get bullied as a child, and Tomari {{would have to come}} to his rescue, saying that she would protect him forever. After Hazumu's initial transformation, Tomari does not know what to do. Ayuki observes that Tomari liked Hazumu more as a boy, {{due to the fact that}} she has had affections for Hazumu for some time. At first, she is very annoyed that everyone around Hazumu is trying to make her more feminine, but ultimately realizes that while Hazumu has changed physically, her personality is still the same, and therefore still the same person inside. Tomari tries to protect Hazumu from the emotional stress Yasuna caused her by rejecting Hazumu by trying to tell Yasuna to back off for the time being, but after Hazumu says she still wants to be Yasuna's friend, Tomari does not push any further.|$|E
2500|$|The {{day after}} the September 11 attacks, the duo {{reportedly}} made some political criticism of the United States relation to Israel, claiming that American support for the Jewish nation was why the attacks occurred, and that all Jewish Americans should take a loyalty oath to the United States. The Anti-Defamation League got hundreds of calls about the incident and {{sent a letter to}} WFAN management – the letter was never answered – and New York Post columnist Phil Mushnick was critical of the duo's statements. Francesa later said the comments [...] "weren’t made", prompting further criticism from Mushnick. When questioned about the controversial statements, WFAN management said that the show in question had not been taped, despite the apparent practice of posting audio recordings of the show on WFAN's website in September 2001. As recently as September 2016, Francesa denied they made the statements saying, [...] "anything that was brought up is utter utter nonsense”. In April 2017, Deadspin reported that recordings of the shows from September 11 and 12, 2001 had been located in the 9/11 archives of the Paley Center for Media. Deadspin writers listened to the September 12 episode, and noted that while Francesa and Russo had argued with a caller about loyalty to the United States versus loyalty to Israel, the broadcast [...] "was not quite the Jew-bashing trainwreck that New York Post columnist Phil Mushnick described". A 30 for 30 show in July 2017 addressed the incident, making the case that it was less incendiary than first reported, but also having friends of the hosts strongly implying that the show was trying to address a subject they did not <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> and veered out of their lane in doing so.|$|E
