40|$|Italian {{horticulture}} {{is characterized}} by a large number of vegetables. Such products comprise red or variegated chicories, called “radicchio” which are cultivated mainly in northeastern Italy. The increased consumers’ demand for these products has led to an increased production which reaches approximately 250000 t/y. A major problem though is the by-products produced from their elaboration in the farm, reaching approximately 10 t/ha. Therefore the bio-valorization of these by-products may be a useful tool to give an additional value to a product otherwise deemed to be wasted. In this work the bio-valorization of red radicchio (Treviso variety) waste was evaluated in a two-stage anaerobic <b>digestion</b> (AD) laboratory-scale <b>apparatus.</b> The tests were made also by mixing this waste with maize to check the possible bio-valorization of the mixture. Two coupled 5 L batch-fed completely stirred reactors, one for the hydrolytic-acidogenic step and one for the acetogenic-methanogenic step, kept at mesophilic temperature, were adopted. All runs were performed without the addition of chemicals. After the evaluation of the retention time of each stage, samples of hydrolized substrates from the first hydrolytic bioreactor were sent to the second methanogenic bioreactor to assess the specific gas production, the methane yield in the biogas produced and the specific methanogenic activity...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} {{problems to be}} solved in connection with night soil digestion tanks in the urban community. As {{part of the program}} for the study of night soil disposal, the author carried out experiments on the production of gas during the digestion of night soil under different conditions. The experiments, conducted with the specific purpose of examining the influence of difference in temperature on night soil gasification, comprised the digestion, at temperatures of 37 ℃ and 30 ℃, of various samples of night soil in <b>digestion</b> chambers. An <b>apparatus</b> specially designed to keep the pressure in the chamber at the level of atmospheric pressure was employed, so that collection of gas liberated by the digesting night soil might not influence volatile matter reduction rates. Gas production during the digestion of night soil at both 37 ℃ and 30 ℃, like gas production in sewage solids digestion, is a two-stage process, consisting of the first and second stages of gasification. The course of night soil digestion, as traced by cummulative gas production, is an S-shaped curve. When night soil was seeded with welldigested sludge, the rate of gas production was higher at a temperature of 37 ℃ than at 30 ℃, giving ground for supposition that the digestion of night soil might be expedited at higher temperatures. Even thoug the addition of sludge, gas production at 37 ℃ was at a higher level than gas production at 30 ℃. A study of the first stage of gas production alone shows that it will be impossible to declare categorically that the volume of gas produced is larger at 37 ℃ than at 30 ℃. It would seem that the amount of gas produced varies with the degree of digestion that various samples of night soil have attained before they are put in digestion chambers for experiments...|$|R
