40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the role of Hydrogen enriched Natural Gas (<b>H</b> 2 <b>NG)</b> in Hybrid Energy Systems for energy {{refurbishment}} purposes. In detail, three different plant layout options were investigated. A photovoltaics (PV) array and two-stage electric heat pump (EHP), a hybrid photovoltaic thermal solar collectors combined to gas heat pump (GHP) fuelled with <b>H</b> 2 <b>NG,</b> and a CHP fuelled with <b>H</b> 2 <b>NG</b> connected to a two-stage EHP were compared. The required receiving surfaces of PV array were estimated for three different direct normal irradiation (DNI) values in Italy in order to assess how the available roof surface affects the layout choice. A sensitivity analysis was carried out with varying the building power to heat ratio (PTHR) and the hydrogen volumetric fraction in the <b>H</b> 2 <b>NG</b> mixtures to assess the primary energy consumption (PEC) and renewable energy fraction. When feasible, the PV + EHP shows the best performance in terms of PEC with a solar energy share equal to 65 %. In other cases, the PV/T + GHP fuelled with <b>H</b> 2 <b>NG</b> @ 30 %vol. can be suitable for PTHR higher than 0. 2 approximately. Furthermore, the third layout CHP + EHP is not competitive with the other solutions but, it is the best option where no roof surfaces are available for PV or PV/T installation...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{accomplish}} significant primary energy saving and GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions reduction, CHP (combined heat and power) {{technology can be}} adopted largely for industrial and civil sectors. Waiting for the cutting-edge appliances (i. e. Fuel Cell) wide deployment, ICEs (internal combustion engines) fuelled with an environmentally-friendly fuel, such as <b>H</b> 2 <b>NG</b> (hydrogen-natural gas mixtures) could represent the bridge technology towards the forthcoming pure hydrogen economy. This paper deals {{with the results of}} an experimental campaign carried out on a Single Cylinder ICE, fuelled with NG (natural gas) and <b>H</b> 2 <b>NG</b> @ 15 % vol. In detail, energy performances were assessed at rated and partial loads. From data analysis, it emerged that the electrical efficiency increased up to 2. 28 %, {{at the expense of the}} heat recovery one, having added hydrogen. Additionally, due to the higher water content in exhaust gas when <b>H</b> 2 <b>NG</b> is burned, it was investigated on how heat recovery efficiency has been affected by condensing operating conditions. Finally, to estimate this benefit, an expeditious procedure was developed building three maps for <b>H</b> 2 <b>NG</b> blends condensing properties from 0 % up to 30 % vol. of H 2. Their outputs provided the condensation efficiency value and the absolute gain of heat recovery one with varying exhaust gas temperatures and hydrogen fraction in the mixture...|$|R

40|$|Currently, Power-to-Gas {{technologies}} are considered viable solutions {{to face the}} onset problems associated with renewable capacity firming. Indeed, carbon-free hydrogen production converting renewable electricity excess and its injection into natural gas pipelines is considered a short- to medium-term solution. In this way, the so-called <b>H</b> 2 <b>NG</b> blends can be fired within internal combustion engines and micro gas turbines operating in CHP mode, offering better environmental-energy performances in machines. As regards the distributed energy generation scenario, the local H 2 production by means of electrolysis for methane enrichment will be more cost-effective if the oxygen is fruitfully used instead of venting it out like a by-product, as usually occurs. This study focuses on the usefulness of using that oxygen to enrich the air-fuel mixture of an internal combustion engine for micro-CHP applications, once it has been fuelled with <b>H</b> 2 <b>NG</b> blends. Thus, the main aim {{of this paper is}} to provide a set of values for benchmarking, in which <b>H</b> 2 <b>NG</b> blends, ranging in 0 %- 15 % vol., burn within an ICE in partial oxy-fuel conditions. In particular, a preliminary energy analysis was carried out based on experimental data, reporting the engine operating parameters, gains and losses in both electrical and heat recovery efficiency. The oxygen content in the air varies up to 22 % vol. A Volkswagen Blue Tender CHP commercial version (19. 8 kWel. of rated electrical power output) was considered as the reference machine and its energy characterization was reported when it operated under those unconventional conditions...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Antimalarial {{combination}} therapy {{is used in}} persons with HIV infection {{in the absence of}} data on drug interactions. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of antimalarial combination artemether/lumefantrine (AL) when administered with the protease inhibitor combination lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in HIV-uninfected healthy volunteers to determine if important drug interactions exist between these agents. DESIGN: Open-label study in healthy HIV-seronegative adults. METHODS: Participants received standard 6 -dose treatment courses of AL 80 / 480 mg twice daily on days 1 - 4 and 28 - 31. LPV/r 400 / 100 mg twice daily was administered on days 16 - 41 after a 2 -week washout period. Plasma concentrations of AL, dihydroartemisinin (DHA, artemether metabolite), lopinavir, and ritonavir were measured. RESULTS: PK of lumefantrine was influenced by LPV/r resulting in 2 - to 3 -fold increases in area under the curve (AUC) (AUC 0 - 264 : 413 versus 931 h. microg. mL; AUC 0 -inf: 456 versus 1073 h. microg. mL). For artemether, trends toward Cmax and AUC decreases (Cmax 14. 3 versus 11. 2 ng/mL and 42. 7 - 62. 0 versus 25. 9 - 40. 5 <b>h.</b> <b>ng.</b> mL for AUC) were noted during coadministration. For DHA, decreases in Cmax (58. 8 versus 37. 3 ng/mL) and AUC (190 - 198 versus 104 - 109 <b>h.</b> <b>ng.</b> mL) were observed during coadministration without changes in DHA:artemether AUC ratios. AL did not affect LPV/r PK. CONCLUSIONS: Coadministration of artmether/lumefantrine and LPV/r can be carried out for patients coinfected with malaria and HIV. Formal safety analysis of concomitant therapy should be addressed by future studies among individuals living in malaria-endemic regions...|$|E

The energy policy of Sapienza University of Rome is focused on energy efficiency and renewable energy sources in order to contribute to a transition as a complete redesign of the whole energy system toward a distributed energy generation, an integration of energy sources, a design of smart new grids including storage strategies. The author, energy manager of Sapienza, starts from a local scale, i. e. the Sapienza Lab for Smart Energy Systems within the Distributed Generation framework at different scales, to elaborate a foreseeable scaling-up process so that to spread the research activities outcomes as best practices. The experiments carried out aim to create a micro smart grid community by using ICT, smart meters, smart electrical and thermal grids connecting energy generation to existing electricity and thermal demands. The micro smart grid uses micro-CHP (engines and turbines) hydromethane <b>H</b> 2 <b>NG</b> drived, individual heating technologies for hydrogen, storage systems, power-to-gas and transmission network.

40|$|Abstract. Suppose that g, h ≥ 3. Then {{there exists}} a (relatively minimal) genus g Lefschetz fibration with only one {{singular}} fiber over a closed (Riemann) surface of genus h. The singular fiber can be chosen to be reducible or irreducible. Let <b>N(g,</b> <b>h)</b> denote the minimal number of singular fibers in a relatively minimal genus g Lefschetz fibration (with at least one singular fiber) over a closed (Riemann) surface of genus h. First we give {{a list of what}} is known about these numbers to indicate that <b>N(g,</b> <b>h)</b> can be greater than one for some g, h. • N(1, h) = 12 for all h ≥ 0. (see [M 1]). • 5 ≤ N(2, h) ≤ 8 for all h ≥ 0. (see [M 2]). In particular, N(2, 0) = 8. (see [C]). • 2 ≤ N(g, 0) for all g ≥ 1. (see [L]). In [C], Cadavid proves that N(g, 0) ≤ 2 g+ 4 if g is even and N(g, 0) ≤ 2 g + 10 if g is odd. • <b>N(g,</b> <b>h)</b> ≤ <b>N(g,</b> 0) for all g, h ≥ 1. (by fiber summing with trivial fibrations.) In this paper, however, we prove the Theorem 1. N(g,h) = 1 for all g, h ≥ 3. Proof. Let Mg denote the mapping class group of a genus g surface Σg for some g ≥ 3. Suppose that γ is a separating simple closed curve on Σg. In [H], Harer shows that {{there exists a}} “lantern ” relation D(γ) D(α 1) D(α 2) D(α 3) = D(β 1) D(β 2) D(β 3) in Mg, where all the curves α 1, α 2, α 3, β 1, β 2, β 3 are nonseparating. Here D(γ) denotes a positive Dehn twist about the curve γ. We can rewrite the lantern relation as follows: D(γ) = D − 1 (α 1) D(β 1) D − 1 (α 2) D(β 2) D − 1 (α 3) D(β 3) ...|$|R
