40|$|This audit {{examined}} the approaches departments and agencies use {{to determine which}} services will be, or have already been, delivered online via digital devices and {{examined the}} ongoing monitoring {{of the effectiveness of}} <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> delivery. We found successes in <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> delivery. However, not all departments and agencies have a complete list of service transactions and costs attributable to delivering the service transactions, and transactions to be transitioned to <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> delivery are not clearly identified. While audited departments and agencies are transitioning to <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> delivery, they remain hindered by pertinent issues such as proof of identity requirements, legacy or inefficient existing information technology systems and inefficient back-office processes. A whole-of-public-sector approach to <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> delivery has yet to be fully realised. <b>Digital</b> <b>service</b> delivery performance monitoring and reporting still needs improvement. Baseline performance targets with monitoring and reporting systems and processes are required to ensure that <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> delivery performance are effectively measured and its benefits are fully realised.

40|$|Conference Theme: Hyperconnected World: Anything, Anywhere, AnytimeSession - General Presentations 3 Despite {{growth of}} {{information}} technology (IT) enabled services, how IT provides flexibility in service rendering and delivery, remains a relatively unexplored area of research. In this study, we investigate how <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> flexibility (DSF) influences performance of credit unions – an exemplary set of service oriented firms. We identify three dimensions of <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> flexibility: (1) basic <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> flexibility (basic DSF), (2) customer-oriented <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> flexibility (customer DSF), and (2) transaction-oriented <b>digital</b> <b>service</b> flexibility (transaction DSF). We argue that transaction DSF complements the basic DSF in influencing the performance, whereas customer DSF has a negative moderation effect on basic DSF and performance relationship. Using an archival data set, we find empirical support for the hypothesized relationships; and discuss contributions and implications of the findings. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
