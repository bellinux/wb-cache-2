During the last years of his life, <b>he</b> <b>wandered</b> throughout the country with his Cuman allies, but he was unable to control the most powerful lords and bishops any more.

He had often been forced to fight, but never wielded the Spear in battle. Gurnemanz tells him that the curse {{preventing}} Parsifal from finding his right path has now been lifted, but that in his absence Amfortas has never unveiled the Grail, and lack of its sustaining properties has caused the death of Titurel. Parsifal is overcome with remorse, blaming himself for this state of affairs. Gurnemanz tells him that today is the day of Titurel's funeral, and that Parsifal has a great duty to perform. Kundry washes Parsifal's feet and Gurnemanz anoints him with water from the Holy Spring, recognizing him as the pure fool, now enlightened by compassion, and as the new King of the Knights of the Grail.|$|E
