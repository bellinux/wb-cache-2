Later in 2005, JMP 6 was introduced. JMP began integrating with SAS in version 7.0 in 2007 and has strengthened this integration ever since. Users can write SAS code in JMP, connect to SAS servers, and retrieve and use data from SAS. Support for bubble plots was added in version 7. JMP 7 also improved <b>data</b> <b>visualization</b> and diagnostics.|$|E

The chapter argues for methodological reflexivity around {{the use of}} <b>data</b> <b>visualizations</b> in research as both instruments and objects of study. The authors develop a heuristic framework for studying three forms of mediation which <b>data</b> <b>visualizations</b> enact – drawing on research and insights from new media studies, science and technology studies, the history and philosophy of science, cultural studies and critical theory. The chapter illustrates these three forms of mediation with an analysis of visualizations of public finances from civil society organizations, media outlets and public institutions. The authors conclude with an argument towards a broader program of critical literacy for reading and doing research with <b>data</b> <b>visualizations...</b>|$|R

In October 2004, the company was acquired by Google, which converted it into a web application. After additional acquisitions of a geospatial <b>data</b> <b>visualization</b> company and a realtime traffic analyzer, Google Maps was launched in February 2005. The service's front end utilizes JavaScript, XML, and Ajax. Google Maps offers an API that allows maps to be embedded on third-party websites, and offers a locator for urban businesses and other organizations in numerous countries around the world. Google Map Maker allowed users to collaboratively expand and update the service's mapping worldwide but was discontinued from March, 2017.

40|$|International audienceThe {{research}} findings {{provide evidence that}} time-oriented <b>data</b> <b>visualizations</b> can contribute to faster information processing, bet-ter understanding and improved recall. Thus, they are used in many application domains – medicine, law enforcement, traffic and navigation control to name but a few. Simultaneously, human's time perception varies depending inter alia on culture, language, personal experience and situational factors. Although, the differences caused by the aforemen-tioned aspects were acknowledged and addressed in the Human Com-puter Interaction (HCI) field for decades their impact on time-oriented <b>data</b> <b>visualizations</b> was largely neglected. To fill this gap, we investigate the influence of time spatializations (or-ganization of time along axes) on the response time and accuracy of inferences based on time-oriented <b>data</b> <b>visualizations.</b> Moreover, we ex-amine users' preferences toward different time arrangements. Our find-ings show that user-adapted organization of time along axes can speed up the decision-making process and increase the user experience...|$|R

In January 2014, Facebook announced a partnership with UK-based social TV analytics company SecondSync which saw the social network make its social TV available outside the company for the first time. Facebook struck the partnership to help marketers understand how people are using the social network to talk about topics such as TV. However, Twitter responded by acquiring SecondSync and Parisian social TV firm Mesagraph three months later. These acquisitions, as well as a partnership with research company Kantar (which it had been working with to develop a suite of analytics tools for the British TV industry since August 2013) strengthened Twitter's dominance of the [...] "second screen" [...] – TV viewers using tablets and smartphones to share their TV experience on social media. With the additional analytic tools, Twitter was able to improve the firm's offering to advertisers, allowing them to, for instance, only promote a tweet onto the timelines of users who were watching a certain programme.|$|E

40|$|As data {{become more}} and more ubiquitous, so too do <b>data</b> <b>visualizations,</b> which {{increasingly}} circulate online and are an important means through which non-experts get access to data. This paper addresses the factors that affect how people engage with <b>data</b> <b>visualizations,</b> a relatively under-researched focus in visualization research to date. Drawing on qualitative, empirical research with users, we identify six factors that affect engagement: subject matter; source/media location; beliefs and opinions; time; emotions; and confidence and skills. In drawing attention to these factors, we bring HCI concerns together with approaches to media audience research, to identify new themes for visualization research. In particular, we argue that our findings have implications for how effectiveness is conceived and defined in relation to <b>data</b> <b>visualizations</b> and how this varies depending on how, by whom, where and for what purpose visualizations are encountered. Our paper aims to extend the horizons of visualization research, in its focus on factors that affect engagement and how these suggest new definitions of effectiveness...|$|R
