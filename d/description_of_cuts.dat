40|$|Cutting {{planes are}} often used as an {{efficient}} means to tighten continuous relaxations of mixed-integer optimization problems and are a vital component of branch-and-cut algorithms. A critical step of any cutting plane algorithm is to find valid inequalities, or cuts, that improve the current relaxation of the integer-constrained problem. The maximally violated valid inequality problem aims {{to find the most}} violated inequality from a given family <b>of</b> <b>cuts.</b> k-projection polytope constraints are a family <b>of</b> <b>cuts</b> that are based on an inner <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cut</b> polytope <b>of</b> size k and are applied to k× k principal minors of a semidefinite optimization relaxation. We propose a bilevel second order cone optimization approach to solve the maximally violated k projection polytope constraint problem. We reformulate the bilevel problem as a single-level mixed binary second order cone optimization problem that can be solved using off-the-shelf conic optimization software. Additionally we present two methods for improving the computational performance of our approach, namely lexicographical ordering and a reformulation with fewer binary variables. All of the proposed formulations are exact. Preliminary results show the computational time and number of branch-and-bound nodes required to solve smal...|$|R
40|$|Abstract − In {{the paper}} a new {{homotopic}} method of fault diagnosis of analogue piecewise linear (PWL) circuits {{based on a}} large-deviation sensitivity model is presented. Homotopy maps one function f(x) into another g(x) by changing the homotopy parameter t∈[0, 1]. The idea of the method relies on using the function f(x) to the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the circuit under test (CUT) in the non-faulty state and the function g(x) to the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> the faulty <b>CUT.</b> For verification <b>of</b> assumed fault hypotheses node homotopic paths are used. The method enables localisation and identification of parametric (soft) faults in nonlinear circuits of PWL type. It is simpler in interpretation and calculation and more robust to the influence <b>of</b> <b>CUT</b> element tolerances and voltage errors {{in comparison with the}} homotopic method previously proposed by authors [8].
