She lived {{exclusively}} in the company of her German ladies-in-waiting and had difficulty in adapting herself to the Swedish people, countryside and climate. She disliked the bad roads, sombre forests and wooded houses, roofed with turf. She also pined for her husband. A year after their wedding she had a miscarriage and became seriously ill. She was tempestuous, excessive, neurotic and jealous. She was often given to harsh language, and she did not spare her husband, even when strangers were present.

Soon Gustavus Adolphus' intimates knew that his married life was a source of grief and anxiety.|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedThere {{appears to}} be a paradox in the {{prostate}} cancer literature: despite the fact that age and comorbidities are positively correlated, comorbidities are associated with worse physical and <b>emotional</b> quality of <b>life</b> while age is associated with worse physical quality of <b>life</b> but better <b>emotional</b> quality of <b>life.</b> <b>Emotional</b> support and positive reframing coping strategies may help explain part of this paradox in that they may be more frequently used by older prostate cancer patients and associated with better <b>emotional</b> quality of <b>life.</b> In an effort to better understand this paradox, the present questionnaire-based study of pre-treatment prostate cancer patients (n= 74) investigated 1) the relations among age, comorbidity level, <b>emotional</b> quality of <b>life,</b> and physical quality of life, 2) age as a potential moderator of the association between comorbidities and <b>emotional</b> quality of <b>life,</b> and 3) an age-specific coping strategy comprised of emotional support and positive reframing as a mediator of the age and <b>emotional</b> quality of <b>life</b> association. Results suggest that age is positively associated with <b>emotional</b> quality of <b>life</b> and comorbidity level is negatively associated with physical quality of life. However, no significant relations were found between age and physical quality of life or comorbidity level and <b>emotional</b> quality of <b>life,</b> nor was an interaction between age and comorbidity level in <b>emotional</b> quality of <b>life</b> confirmed. Age-specific coping strategies were not found to mediate the relation between age and <b>emotional</b> quality of <b>life</b> either, but statistical trends suggest that older patients may appraise their prostate cancer diagnoses as less distressing than their younger counterparts and therefore use fewer coping strategies in general.

A set of eight self-administered scales were filled up by 516 subjects, aged between 14 and 34 (M = 18. 62; SD = 3. 32).

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationship between perceived emotional intelligence, selfesteem and life satisfaction in a sample of 316 Spanish adolescents (179 females and 137 males), ranging in age from 14 to 18. Demographic information was collected, along with data through the use of three self-report measures: the Trait Meta-Mood Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. As expected, perceived emotional dimensions, particularly mood clarity and repair, showed positive associations with life satisfaction. Self-esteem also correlated significantly and positively with levels of adolescents´ satisfaction with life. More interestingly, results of structural equation modelling indicated that mood clarity and emotional repair had a significant direct and indirect link (via selfesteem) with life satisfaction in adolescents. The present study contributes to an emerging understanding of the underlying process between perceived <b>emotional</b> intelligence and <b>life</b> satisfaction. Our findings encourage moving beyond the examination of direct association between perceived <b>emotional</b> intelligence and <b>life</b> satisfaction and focusing on the role of potential mechanisms such as self-esteem involved in the link between perceived <b>emotional</b> intelligence and <b>life</b> satisfaction in adolescents.

40|$|Much {{attention}} has been paid to the psychological processes underlying the improvement in mood states and human well-being, particularly during adolescence. Theoretical and empirical research suggests that emotional skills may play a role in enhancing perceived well-being; however the mechanisms involved in during adolescence are unclear. The purpose of this study was to extend understanding by investigating the potential mediators of the relationship between <b>emotional</b> intelligence and <b>life</b> satisfaction in a two-year study. Participants were 269 high school students (145 girls and 124 boys) who completed the self-report Perceived Emotional Intelligence Scale (PEIS), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) three times at one-year intervals. The three-step longitudinal design corroborated earlier research indicating that positive and negative affect mediate the relationships between <b>emotional</b> intelligence and <b>life</b> satisfaction. Students with high PEI tended to have more positive experiences and fewer negative experiences, which contributed to their greater life satisfaction. No sex differences were found in the multi-group analyses, suggesting that the causal relationships are similar in both sexes. These findings extend our understanding of the complex network of relationships involving perceived <b>emotional</b> intelligence and <b>life</b> satisfaction in adolescence.
