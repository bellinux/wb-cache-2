40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} to {{investigate}} the effect of a variety of root canal irrigation solutions on flexural strength of dentin. Materials and Methods: Fifty intact, extracted human mandibular third molars were used in this study. Each tooth was sectioned using diamond cutting disc to create dentin bar (1 x 1 mm, with 7 mm in length). All dentin bars were randomly assigned into 5 groups of 10 each. Group 1, dentin bars were immersed in 5 % NaOCl; group 2, in 2. 5 % NaOCl; group 3, in 15 % EDTA; group 4, in 0. 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX); and group 5, in saline (as control) respectively. Each group was immeresed for 2 hours. Each dentin bar was subjected to a three-point bend using MTS Universal Testing Machine to test the flexural strength. Data were analyzed using one way Anova, followed by Tukey's test performed at the 0. 05 level of significance. Results: All irrigation solution {{have an effect on the}} flexural strength (P< 0. 05). EDTA caused the greatest effect on dentin mechanical properties, which revealed the lowest flexural strength (100. 64 ± 7. 23). In contrast, 0. 2 % CHX generated the least influence on dentin mechanical properties, which demonstrated the greatest flexural strength (189. 85 ± 6. 44). Conclusion: Root canal irrigation solution can induce effect on flexural strength of <b>detin.</b> Chlorhexidine gluconate demonstrates the best irrigation solution since it has a slight effect on dentinal mechanical properties, particularly flexural strength.

40|$|Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-Ray Microanalysis (EDS) {{have been}} used to {{investigate}} rapid <b>detinning,</b> pitting corrosion and cosmetic corrosion in plain tin plate food cans and pitting corrosion, underenamel corrosion, enamel flaking, sulfide black corrosion and stress corrosion cracking in enamelled food cans. Through the use of SEM - EDS it was determined that (SnL a /FeK a) Y 2 X -ray line intensities arc proportional to the tin coating weight on tinplate. The method was applied to a rapid <b>detinning</b> problem in canned grapefruit sections. The cause of the early corrosion failure was found to be reversed tinplate. An early pining corrosion failure in apple sauce packed in plain tinplate cans was re lated to use of tinplate sensitive to pin ing corrosion in combination with a product contain ing oxygen and nickel as corrosion accelerators. An internal rust ing cosmetic corrosion problem present on the inside tinplate ends of canned mushrooms was caused by exposed steel at lightly tinned surface ridges of tinplate reacting with moisture and oxygen in the product. An early pitting corrosion problem in carrots packed in enamelled cans was related to excessive metal exposure at the side seam weld and at various a reason the can body. An underenamel corrosion and enamel flaking problem in canned pet food was caused by the inadvertent use of black plate instead of tin free steel. A sulfide black corrosion problem on the tin free steel ends of canned minced clams may be related to enamel fracture. A stress corrosion cracking problem in canned pet food may be related to can coating integrity and copper residues in the product...|$|E
40|$|Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray Microanalysis (EDS) {{have been}} used to {{investigate}} product container interaction problems in plain tinplate metal food containers and to examine glass and glass-like particles that were found in canned food. Through the use of SEM-EDS, it was determined that: sulfate containing particles from the cannery cooling water reacted with exposed iron or tin-iron alloy on the tinplate surface causing an external rusting problem; sulfur dioxide was responsible for a container discoloration and a pitting corrosion problem in canned fruit nectar; hydrogen sulfide produced from the SO 2 -tinplate reaction was the cause of an associated off-odor problem; copper, possibly from a side seam welding operation, excessive headspace oxygen and a beading defect on the container body wall helped explain a <b>detinning</b> and pitting corrosion problem in canned fried apples. a quantitative SEM-EDS method was used to measure the composition of glass particles in two alleged product tampering cases involving canned food. Glass-like particles from a tomato powder and canned peas were also examined...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{processing}} water quality, specifically calcium and magnesium salt content (0 - 500 mg/ 1) {{and the addition}} of chelating agents (0 - 250 mg/ 1 of aminopolycarboxylic acids, polyphosphates, hydroxycarboxylic acids or phytates), upon physico-chemical and organoleptic characteristics of canned Jonathan and Delicious apple slices, Montmorency cherries and Blue Lake green beans was investigated. Physical determinations: shear values, turbidity of syrup or brine measured via light transmittance, Hunter color and color difference meter readings and internal can corrosion; chemical composition: pectin as calcium pectate, volatile reducing substances, total acidity, pigment determinations, nitrate-nitrogen values; and sensory measurements: texture, shape, flavor, aroma, color value and uniformity of product and color value and turbidity of product brine or syrup were ascertained. Analyses of variance, Duncan 2 ̆ 7 s multiple mean comparison range tests and correlation or coefficients were calculated when appropriate. Use of hard water (300 mg/ 1) as a processing medium for canned apple slices and sour cherries decreased color and flavor acceptability but increased firmness and shear values. Excessive hardness toughened cherry epidermis making texture undesirable. Addition of 250 mg/ 1 CaNa 2 EDTA to Delicious apple slices canned in water containing 300 mg/ 1 salts improved color and flavor while firmness was retained. Delicious apple slices were firmer, and higher shear, nitrate-nitrogen and aroma scores and caused less <b>detinning</b> than Jonathan samples in all storage groups. As corrosion increased, nitrate-nitrogen, shear, firmness, flavor, aroma, and pigment values decreased. Color acceptability, reflectance, flavor and volatile reducing substance were higher and redness lower for Jonathan apple slices than Delicious samples stored at 35 and 75 F for 1 and 3 months, respectively, but not necessarily for samples stored at 100 F for 4 months. EDTA was ineffective in maintaining or improving Jonathan apple or Montmorency cherry quality, probably due ot the acidity of these cultivars. Apple and cherry quality decreased as storage temperature and duration increased from 35, 75 to 100 F for 1, 3 and 4 or 5 months, respectively, for all samples except Delicious apple slices with CaNa 2 EDTA. EDTA did provide most color protection in sour cherries, and citric acid, best flavor and aroma scores, while commercial and tap water processed sour cherries showed most deterioration, but none were of acceptable commercial quality after 5 month storage at 100 F. When comparing 1 month storage at 35 F with 3 months at 75 F, analyses of variance showed significant differences for every cherry characteristic measured except texture judged subjectively. All F values for apple storage variables were significant. Blue Lake green beans canned using distilled water or with 250 mg/ 1 CaNa 2 EDTA had higher color and greenness values, less turbidity, generally better flavor and aroma, but lower shear, shape and firmness scores than tap or hard water or commercially processed green beans. Addition of 250 mg/ 1 ascorbic acid to hard water used to process green beans retained greenness, clarity of brine, flavor and aroma while reducing slough and splitting of pods, when stored 4 months at 75 F...|$|E
