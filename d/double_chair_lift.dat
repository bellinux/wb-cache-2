5000|$|Elk Mountain {{opened in}} 1959. [...] The ski area {{provided}} a small lodge, a 2200 ft T-Bar ski lift, tow rope lifts {{and a small}} number of trails. In 1961 a <b>double</b> <b>chair</b> <b>lift</b> was installed, allowing for additional trails. A year later, in 1962, snowmaking was added along with a new A-frame lodge {{at the base of the}} mountain. Night skiing came to Elk Mountain in 1966—expanding to more trails in 1972. Elk Mountain built a 4000 ft long quad chairlift in 1994.|$|E
50|$|It was {{replaced}} by a new <b>double</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>Lift</b> 1A, which was also based nearby. Lift 1A only went half the distance its predecessor had, requiring a second lift change {{to get to the top}} of the mountain, and eventually it was removed and replaced after Aspen built a gondola all the way to the summit from a new base station several blocks to the east. In 1999 the trees and shrubs that had grown in around Lift 1's base station were replaced to reveal the original structure.|$|E
50|$|Riblet {{built its}} first {{chairlift}} in 1938 at Mount Hood, Oregon. Byron Riblet died in 1952, {{but the company}} boomed with the postwar rise of ski resorts. Skiing gained in popularity, and soon ski lifts became the {{major part of the}} Riblet Tramway Company's business. They built more than 400 lifts, particularly in Washington, Oregon, and California, and as far away as Australia. They have the most <b>double</b> <b>chair</b> <b>lifts</b> operating in the U.S.|$|R

There are {{plans to build a}} ski jumping facility in Macedonia, possibly in Mavrovo.|$|R
50|$|Almost all the old, slow, <b>double</b> <b>chair</b> <b>lifts</b> were {{replaced}} with high-speed quad, and six-seater lifts, traveling at around 1000 feet per minute. For these modernizations, the resort {{is a longtime}} customer to the Doppelmayr group. Several old lifts were also removed. The Mid-Chalet, which once had picnic tables on its roof, was completely remodeled in the early 2000s, renamed McCoy Station, and now features gourmet foods and a cafeteria. Large vintage photos of McCoy and his family can be found {{hanging from the ceiling}} there. The Mill Cafe, a small rustic bar and snack area was added in the early 2000s.|$|R
5000|$|At mid-mountain, {{a second}} day lodge (Pioneer Lodge - 1973) sits at 6800 ft with a sizable parking lot, a cluster of condominia (1975), and the Jason Harper Training Center.

5000|$|Residents of Bozeman are {{alerted to}} the arrival of fresh snow by a {{flashing}} blue beacon placed atop the Baxter Hotel in downtown Bozeman. First installed in 1988, it is activated every time Bridger Bowl accumulates two inches of fresh snow, and remains on for 24 hours. Maintenance of the light is a priority, and only once in 20 years was it out of operation for two days.Bridger Bowl opened the new Schlasman's chairlift for the 2008/2009 season, the first lift-served terrain expansion in 30 years. Schlasman's is a reconditioned 1976 Doppelmayr <b>double</b> <b>chair</b> <b>lift,</b> formerly known as the [...] "Peruvian" [...] lift, purchased from Snowbird ski resort in Utah. This new lift (named after a miner who died in an avalanche in 1885) has a vertical rise of 1700 ft and adds 311 acre of new lift-served terrain for expert skiers only. To ride this lift, skiers are required to carry an avalanche transceiver; partners and shovels are highly recommended. For the 2013/2014 season, Bridger Bowl unveiled its new Powder Park and Alpine chair lifts. These brand-new lifts tripled the uphill capacity (3,300/people/hr vs. 1,100/people/hr) compared to the [...] "old Alpine" [...] center pole, double chair that was retired {{at the end of the}} 2012/2013 season.Bridger Bowl is noted for its expert-only skiing terrain known as [...] "The Ridge". There are six sections of the ridge known as Schlasman's, D Route, C Route, B Route, A route and Northwest/Hidden Gully Areas. In order to ski or snowboard the ridge, an avalanche beacon and shovel are required. Most of the ridge is hiking terrain.|$|E

Snowmaking covers 100% of the 180 acres of skiable terrain. The base complex features a day lodge, guest services, ski school center, restaurant, rentals, and a ski-and-snowboard shop.|$|R
50|$|Okemo {{was founded}} in 1955 {{by a group of}} local businessmen. Operations officially began January 31, 1956, with four inches (102 mm) of snow and trails {{serviced}} by two Poma surface lifts. The lower poma cost 20 cents per ride, while the upper one cost 60 cents. The early 1960s saw the introduction of four more Pomas. In these years, Okemo had a reputation of operating with all Poma platter lifts, while other ski areas used <b>double</b> <b>chair</b> <b>lifts</b> to serve advanced ski terrain. The first chairlift, the Sachem double, was introduced in 1965. Along with all of these improvements, Okemo began to offer slopeside lodging starting in 1961. In 1963, Okemo purchased its first groomer, a Tucker Sno-Cat model. Snowmaking was first used, starting with {{the lower part of the}} mountain, in 1966.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of their elevation, Sankt Andreasberg (520-720 m) and Sonnenberg (800-850 m) still have fairly {{guaranteed}} snow.

5000|$|After {{moving to}} the Weigmann company in Oberstdorf, in Allgäu, he was {{involved}} as designer and construction manager in the realization of two still operating chairlifts at [...] (...) and Rheingau (cableway Assmannshausen). Weigmann built several fixed chairlifts during the economic boom after World War Two in the 1950s. The two mentioned railways in Assmannshausen and in Wupper (Remscheid-Solingen) have been in operation for almost 50 years and have not needed much repair, save for the exchange of some worn parts. In the 1950s, the small company built ski lifts and one-seater and two-seater chairlifts. The heavy steel constructions were almost indestructible and expensive. As Weigmann references, the Koblatlift in the Nebelhorn and various ski lifts in the Black Forest were {{in addition to the}} two aforementioned <b>double</b> <b>chair</b> <b>lifts.</b> After the early death of the owner Herbert Weigmann in 1956, the company broke up and was eventually transferred to the Hermann Heuss GmbH in Geretsried.|$|R
