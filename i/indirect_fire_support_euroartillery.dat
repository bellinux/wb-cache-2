50|$|The maximum {{elevation}} {{angle of the}} ZiS-3 was the highest of all Soviet self-propelled guns. The maximum <b>indirect</b> <b>fire</b> distance was nearly 17 km.

50|$|The Dragon Fire 120 mm heavy mortar was {{designed}} and produced by the French company TDA Armaments that {{was picked up by}} the US Marine Corps for its EFSS (Expeditionary <b>Fire</b> <b>Support</b> System) requirement.

Another feature of the M120 is the M303 Sub-Caliber insert, which allows the mortar to fire 81 mm ammunition.|$|R
50|$|The Singapore Artillery is a {{formation}} of the Singapore Army. It consists of two regular battalions and currently one active National Service (NS) and Reservist battalions.

50|$|When the Volunteers were subsumed {{into the}} new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908, the 2nd Kent RGA was split to form two {{howitzer}} brigades in the Royal Field Artillery (RFA), the IV London at Lewisham, and the VIII London at Plumstead.

On 20 October 1944, the untried 95th Infantry Division relieved the 5th Infantry Division in place on the bridgehead between the Moselle and Seille Rivers, giving the 5th a well-needed rest from the line. During the relief, the 735th Tank Battalion remained in the line and was detached from the 5th Infantry Division and attached to the 95th.

50|$|The U.S. Army uses {{three types}} of mortar for <b>indirect</b> <b>fire</b> <b>support</b> when heavier {{artillery}} may not be appropriate or available.

At the next higher echelon, infantry battalions are typically supported by a section of 81 mm M252 mortars. The largest mortar in the army's inventory is the 120 mm M120/M121, usually employed by mechanized units.|$|R

40|$|The U. S.

This article describes the PDA software architecture developed {{as part of this}} research. The purpose of this project was to develop a proof-of-concept Handheld Terminal Unit (HTU) to allow dismounted forward observers (FOs) to create and submit digital calls for <b>indirect</b> <b>fire</b> <b>support</b> (e. g., mortars, artillery, bombs from aircraft, etc.). Feedback from U. S. Army and Marine Corps units, however, indicated that users found the HTU bulky, heavy, and difficult to use. In response, the project manager (PM), Intelligence and Effects contracted the Information Technology and Operations Center (ITOC) and the U. S. Military Academy to conduct a market survey of available commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions to these complaints. At the time of the survey (1999 - 2000), no suitable COTS hardware existed; however, the ITOC recommended that the PM develop open-systems platform-independent software so that when personal digital assistant (PDA) technology provided a viable COTS hardware solution...|$|R
