5|$|Approximately {{two-thirds of}} human serpins perform {{extracellular}} roles, inhibiting proteases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream</b> {{in order to}} modulate their activities. For example, extracellular serpins regulate the proteolytic cascades central to blood clotting (antithrombin), the inflammatory and immune responses (antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, and C1-inhibitor) and tissue remodelling (PAI-1).

40|$|Mice were {{infected}} intravenously with a sublethal dose of Listeria monocytogenes cells and then levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstreams,</b> spleens, and livers were monitored. The maximum level of TNF was detected at 72 h <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spleens and livers, but TNF was never detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstreams.</b> IL- 6 appeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstreams</b> and spleens and peaked at 48 h. The maximum level of IFN-gamma could be detected {{in all three}} specimens, and the highest titer was shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spleens. Endogenous TNF production was suppressed by in vivo administration of anti-CD 4 monoclonal antibody (MAb) or anti-asialo GM 1 antibody but not by anti-CD 8 MAb, whereas none of these antibodies suppressed endogenous IL- 6 production. Endogenous production of neither IL- 6 nor IFN-gamma was inhibited in rabbit anti-recombinant mouse TNF-alpha antibody-treated mice. Similarly, production of TNF and IL- 6 did not decrease in anti-mouse IFN-gamma MAb-treated animals, but TNF production was augmented in these animals. These {{results suggest that the}} these endogenous cytokines are produced by different mechanisms in L. monocytogenes infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} and roles of endogenous gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) in both lethal and nonlethal infections of Staphylococcus aureus were investigated <b>in</b> mice. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of nonlethal infection, although no bacteria were detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstreams,</b> bacteria that colonized and proliferated persistently for 3 weeks were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kidneys. All mice given lethal injections died within 7 days, and {{large numbers of}} bacteria were detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstreams,</b> spleens, and kidneys. The first peaks of IFN-gamma, TNF, and IL- 6 were observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstreams</b> and spleens of the mice with nonlethal and lethal infections within 24 h. Thereafter, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nonlethal cases, IFN-gamma, TNF, and IL- 6 peaked again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spleens and kidneys {{during the period of}} maximum growth of bacteria <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kidneys, although only IL- 6 was detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sera. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of lethal infection, the titers of IFN-gamma and IL- 6 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sera and TNF <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kidneys peaked before death. Effects of in vivo administration of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against IFN-gamma and TNF on the fates of S. aureus-infected mice were studied. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> nonlethal infections, anti-TNF alpha (anti-TNF-alpha) MAb-treated mice, but not anti-IFN-gamma MAb-treated mice, {{died as a result of}} worsening infection, suggesting that endogenous TNF plays a protective role in host resistance to S. aureus infection. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> mice that received lethal doses, injection of anti-TNF-alpha MAb accelerated death. However, although injection of anti-IFN-gamma MAb inhibited host resistance of the infected mice early in infection, most of the animals survived the lethal infection by injection of anti-IFN-gamma MAb, suggesting that endogenous IFN-gamma plays a detrimental role in S. aureus infection. Thus, this study demonstrated that IFN-gamma and TNF play different roles in S. aureus infection...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} presumed that gamma {{interferon}} (IFN-gamma), which plays {{an essential role}} in antilisterial resistance, is produced late in Listeria monocytogenes infection. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present study, however, IFN-gamma was detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstreams</b> and spleens of mice from days 1 to 4 of L. monocytogenes infection by both a double-sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and an immunohistochemical technique, suggesting that endogenous IFN-gamma is produced early but not late in L. monocytogenes infection...|$|R

5|$|The blunted {{ventilatory}} {{response is}} attributed to several factors. Obese people tend to have raised levels of the hormone leptin, which is secreted by adipose tissue and under normal circumstances increases ventilation. In OHS, this effect is reduced. Furthermore, episodes of nighttime acidosis (e.g. due to sleep apnea) lead to compensation by the kidneys with retention of the alkali bicarbonate. This normalizes the acidity of the blood. However, bicarbonate stays around <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream</b> for longer, and further episodes of hypercapnia lead to relatively mild acidosis and reduced ventilatory response in a vicious circle.|$|E
40|$|Transmission of a {{protozoan}} parasite from a vertebrate to invertebrate host {{is accompanied}} by cellular differentiation. The signals from the environment that trigger the process are poorly understood. The model parasite Trypanosoma brucei proliferates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mammalian <b>bloodstream</b> and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tsetse fly. On ingestion by the tsetse, the trypanosome undergoes a rapid differentiation that is marked by replacement of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat with GPI-anchored EP and GPEET procyclins. Here we show that a cold shock of ΔT > 15 °C is sufficient to reversibly induce high-level expression of the insect stage-specific EP gene <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mammalian <b>bloodstream</b> stages of T. brucei. The 3 ′-UTR of the EP mRNA is necessary and sufficient for the increased expression. During cold shock, EP protein accumulates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> endosomal compartment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proliferating, slender, <b>bloodstream</b> stage, whereas <b>the</b> EP is present on <b>the</b> plasma membrane <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quiescent, stumpy, <b>bloodstream</b> stage.

40|$|The {{effects of}} 15 -deoxyspergualin (DSG), an {{immunosuppressive}} agent, on host resistance against Listeria monocytogenes were studied in mice.

5|$|Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes {{that travel}} {{throughout}} the body in pursuit of invading pathogens.

Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and: (i) produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and cytokines, while they can also (ii) act as scavengers that rid the body of worn-out cells and other debris, and as antigen-presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of drug delivery liposomes had a simple lipid composition and suffered from several limitations.

5|$|The muscle {{weakness}} and {{increased risk of}} irregular heart beat in TPP result from markedly reduced levels of potassium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream.</b> Potassium is not in fact lost from the body, but increased Na+/K+-ATPase activity (the enzyme that moves potassium into cells and keeps sodium in the blood) leads to shift of potassium into tissues, and depletes the circulation.

Moreover, injection of anti-complement receptor type 3 (Mac- 1, CD 11 b) resulted in inhibition of anti-CD 3 MAb-induced antilisterial resistance. These results suggest that the preventive effect of anti-CD 3 MAb might be due to activation of phagocytes by TNF and IFN-gamma induced by stimulating CD 4 + T cells and CD 8 + T cells with the MAb.
