5|$|In 2015, Gardein's <b>Gluten-Free</b> Beefless Ground was {{a finalist}} for Best Meat Replacement in Delicious Living Magazine's third annual Best Bite Awards. In the same year, they {{received}} the Progressive Grocer Category Advisor Award (Frozen Meatless Foods category) for their Fishless Fillets.|$|E
5|$|Seasonal {{items were}} first {{introduced}} {{to supplement the}} menu in 2002. Two years later, noodle-less entrees were added {{in response to the}} trend for low-carb diets. The following year it introduced a whole-grain Tuscan fettuccine. Naturally raised pork was added as a meat option in 2012. Three seasonal items and a <b>gluten-free</b> fusilli were added in April 2013.|$|E
5|$|Nutrition {{facts are}} {{posted on the}} company's website. As with most pasta-based dishes, the company's noodles dishes are high in carbohydrates, with regular-sized dishes {{containing}} 80–150 grams of carbohydrates per serving (the company's salads and sandwiches tend to be lower in carbohydrates). Many of the regular-sized pasta dishes exceed 1,000 calories, but smaller portions with under 500 calories are available for some dishes. Noodles and Company offers dishes made with <b>gluten-free</b> and vegan ingredients, but warns that cross-contamination may occur.|$|E
5|$|Applesauce cake is {{a dessert}} cake {{prepared}} using apple sauce, flour and sugar as main ingredients. Store-bought or homemade applesauce {{may be used}} in its preparation. Additional ingredients include eggs, butter, margarine or oil, raisins and plumped raisins, dates, chopped apple, chopped nuts (such as walnuts and pecans), cocoa powder, and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and allspice. Some versions include dried or fresh, finely grated ginger. After baking, applesauce cake is sometimes topped with an icing, frosting or glaze, such as a caramel glaze. It also may be served topped with a dusting of confectioner's sugar or whipped cream. <b>Gluten-free</b> applesauce cake can be prepared using rice flour.|$|E
5|$|Gardein (a {{portmanteau}} {{of garden}} and protein) {{is a product}} line of meat-free foods made by Garden Protein International in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada. In November 2014, Pinnacle Foods purchased Gardein for $154 million. Founder Yves Potvin stayed on with the company, and has stated that the buy-out assisted Gardein to access more capital and expand manufacturing facilities to Hagerstown. All Gardein products are vegan, and they are certified by Vegan Action. Most of Gardein's products are certified Kosher pareve by Kosher Check (The Orthodox Rabbinical Council of BC). In 2014, they added <b>gluten-free</b> beefless products to their range {{in response to the}} expanding gluten allergy market.|$|E
5|$|Gastrointestinal {{disorders}} are sometimes associated with aphthous-like stomatitis, e.g. most commonly Celiac disease, but also {{inflammatory bowel disease}} such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The link between gastrointestinal disorders and aphthous stomatitis is probably related to nutritional deficiencies caused by malabsorption. Less than 5% of people with RAS have Celiac disease, which usually presents with severe malnutrition, anemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). Sometimes aphthous-like ulcerations can be {{the only sign of}} celiac disease. Despite this association, a <b>gluten-free</b> diet does not usually improve the oral ulceration.|$|E
5|$|Letting bean dip {{sit for a}} {{while before}} serving can {{increase}} the intermingling of flavors in the dish. Bean dip can be served cold, at room temperature, or as a hot dish. Hot bean dip can be prepared ahead of time, refrigerated and then cooked at a later time, and can also be prepared using a slow cooker and served in the appliance. Bean dip can be prepared as a vegan and <b>gluten-free</b> dish. The dish is typically served with tortilla chips, and can also be served with crackers, crudités, breadsticks, pita bread and toasted bread such as baguette.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all beer {{includes}} {{barley malt}} {{as the majority}} of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the mash, and act as a filter bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. Some brewers have produced <b>gluten-free</b> beer, made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.|$|E
25|$|Use of pure oats in a <b>gluten-free</b> diet offers {{improved}} {{nutritional value}} {{from the rich}} content of oat protein, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and lipids, but remains controversial because {{a small proportion of}} people with celiac disease react to pure oats. Some cultivars of pure oat could be a safe part of a <b>gluten-free</b> diet, requiring knowledge of the oat variety used in food products for a <b>gluten-free</b> diet. Determining whether oat consumption is safe is critical because people with poorly controlled celiac disease may develop multiple severe health complications, including cancers.|$|E

25|$|Like {{all types}} of rice, glutinous rice does not contain dietary gluten (i.e. does not contain {{glutenin}} and gliadin), and should be safe for <b>gluten-free</b> diets.|$|E
25|$|Management {{of wheat}} allergy {{consists}} of complete withdrawal of any food containing wheat and other gluten-containing cereals (<b>gluten-free</b> diet). Nevertheless, some patients can tolerate barley, rye or oats.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{association}} between celiac disease and esophageal cancer. People with untreated celiac disease have a higher risk, but this risk decreases with time after diagnosis, {{probably due to the}} adoption of a <b>gluten-free</b> diet, which seems to have a protective role against development of malignancy in people with celiac disease. However, the delay in diagnosis and initiation of a <b>gluten-free</b> diet seems to increase the risk of malignancy. Moreover, in some cases the detection of celiac disease is due to the development of cancer, whose early symptoms are similar to some that may appear in celiac disease.|$|E
25|$|Undiagnosed {{maternal}} {{celiac disease}} may cause a short {{duration of the}} breastfeeding period. Treatment with the <b>gluten-free</b> diet can increase its duration and restore it to the average value of the healthy women.|$|E
25|$|Anxiety is {{a common}} feature of GSE; {{treatment}} on a <b>gluten-free</b> diet is effective at reducing anxiety, some aspect {{of which may be}} due to malabsorption phenomena and cytokine activity (i.e. constant stress).|$|E
25|$|Concessions at TD Bank Ballpark include {{traditional}} ballpark fare, {{health food}} and <b>gluten-free</b> options. The official hospitality provider is HomePlate Catering & Hospitality. The Patriots Team Store, {{located at the}} main gate, is the Somerset Patriots' official merchandise and souvenir store.|$|E
25|$|In {{people with}} coeliac disease {{adherence}} to a <b>gluten-free</b> diet decreases {{the risk of developing}} osteoporosis and increases bone density. The diet must ensure optimal calcium intake (of at least one gram daily) and measuring vitamin D levels is recommended, and to take specific supplements if necessary.|$|E
25|$|A typical bagel has 260–350 calories, 1.0–4.5 {{grams of}} fat, 330–660 milligrams of sodium, and 2–5 grams of fiber. <b>Gluten-free</b> bagels {{have much more}} fat, often 9 grams, because of the {{presence}} in the dough of ingredients that supplant wheat flour in the original.|$|E
25|$|Technological {{innovations}} such {{as these}} have introduced various food additives into ice cream, the notable one being the stabilizing agent gluten, to which some people have an intolerance. Recent awareness of this issue has prompted a number of manufacturers to start producing <b>gluten-free</b> ice cream.|$|E
25|$|Refractory coeliac disease (RCD). RCD or non-strict <b>gluten-free</b> diet are two {{causes of}} failure of AGA {{to return to}} {{normality}} on the GF diet. In the first instance lymphocytes may remain stimulated even though the antigen that originally stimulated them {{was removed from the}} diet.|$|E
25|$|The R5 {{sandwich}} assay {{is another}} such assay. This assay can recognize wheat, barley and rye, {{which makes it}} ideal for evaluating the presence of contaminants in <b>gluten-free</b> foods that do not contain oat. This antibody is a recommended testing protocol in a proposed revision of the Codex Alimentarius.|$|E
25|$|When lactose {{intolerance}} {{is due to}} secondary lactase deficiency, treatment of the underlying disease may allow lactase activity to return to normal levels. In people with coeliac disease, {{lactose intolerance}} normally reverts or improves several months after starting a <b>gluten-free</b> diet, but temporary dietary restriction of lactose may be needed.|$|E
25|$|In genetically {{susceptible}} people, gluten – a {{major part}} of wheat protein – can trigger coeliac disease. Coeliac disease affects about 1% of the general population in developed countries. There is evidence that most cases remain undiagnosed and untreated. The only known effective treatment is a strict lifelong <b>gluten-free</b> diet.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{traditional}} Chinese jianbing, some vendors in the U.S. offer various versions of it to cater to American customers’ taste, such as vegetarian jianbing and <b>gluten-free</b> jianbing. Culture-crossing fillings like barbecue pulled pork, bacon, cheese, hot dogs and Spam are additionally provided to let customers create their own customized Jianbing.|$|E
25|$|Childhood (male) type 1 {{diabetes}} (T1D) {{increases the}} risk for CD and vice versa and the early signs of celiac disease may precede T1D in many cases. A search for CD in juvenile diabates patients revealed that a <b>gluten-free</b> diet resulted in some improvements. An elevated number of diabetes patients have ATA along with increased numbers of gluten-specific T-cells.|$|E
25|$|Use of pure oat {{products}} is an option, with {{the assessment of}} a health professional, when the celiac person {{has been on a}} <b>gluten-free</b> diet for at least 6 months and all celiac symptoms have disappeared clinically. Celiac disease may relapse in few cases with the consumption of pure oats. Screening with serum antibodies for celiac disease is not sensitive enough to detect people who react to pure oats and the absence of digestive symptoms is not an accurate indicator of intestinal recovery because up to 50% of people with active celiac disease have no digestive symptoms. symptoms correlate poorly with mucosal pathology,6 and even with excellent dietary adherence, histology and coeliac antibodies can take several years to normalize.7}} The lifelong follow-up of celiac people who choose to consume oats may require periodic performance of intestinal biopsies. The long-term effects of pure oats consumption are still unclear and further well-designed studies identifying the cultivars used are needed before making final recommendations for a <b>gluten-free</b> diet.|$|E
25|$|Delany, in 2003, tried {{having an}} {{injection}} of botox in her forehead, but the needle hit a nerve {{and created a}} bruise which affected the muscle in her right eye, causing it to droop slightly. In 2010, she vowed {{she would never have}} plastic surgery. She told Prevention in 2010 that she prefers eating healthily, including vegetables, tofu, fish, <b>gluten-free</b> pasta, and bread.|$|E
25|$|Depression in GSE {{has several}} causes; {{in the more}} severe CD, {{depression}} can {{be the result of}} lower vitamin adsorption and essential fatty acid adsorption (see section on autism). Depression and anger may also be the result of lower quality of life issues as a result of <b>gluten-free</b> diet. Depression appears to persist on gluten free diet in a sizable fraction of GSE. Elevated anger has been noted also with GSE.|$|E
25|$|In France, {{the first}} online shop for edible insects and {{products}} with edible insects came online in 2009. They {{have been offered}} edible insects from Thailand, Africa and Europe especially as appetizer, a ready-to-cook range but also home made candies and <b>gluten-free</b> protein bars with bugs. In 2011, Micronutris created the first French farm to raise insects. They grow mealworms and crickets in the South of France at Toulouse and craft fine products with them.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{buckwheat}} {{has been}} used as a substitute for other grains in <b>gluten-free</b> beer. Although it is not an actual cereal (being a pseudocereal), buckwheat can be used in the same way as barley to produce a malt that can form the basis of a mash that will brew a beer without gliadin or hordein (together gluten) and therefore can be suitable for coeliacs or others sensitive to certain glycoproteins.|$|E
25|$|Subclinical {{deficiency}} {{has also}} been observed in women taking oral contraceptives, in the elderly, in people with eating disorders, chronic alcoholism and in diseases such as HIV, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes and chronic heart disease. The Celiac Disease Foundation points out that a <b>gluten-free</b> diet may be low in riboflavin (and other nutrients) as enriched wheat flour and wheat foods (bread, pasta, cereals, etc.) is a major dietary contribution to total riboflavin intake.|$|E
25|$|Raw rice may {{be ground}} into flour for many uses, {{including}} making {{many kinds of}} beverages, such as amazake, horchata, rice milk, and rice wine. Rice does not contain gluten, so is suitable for people on a <b>gluten-free</b> diet. Rice may also be made into various types of noodles. Raw, wild, or brown rice may also be consumed by raw-foodist or fruitarians if soaked and sprouted (usually a week to 30 days – gaba rice).|$|E
25|$|Further ingredient-related {{lawsuits}} {{have been}} brought against McDonald's since 2006. McDonald's had included its French fries on its website in a list of <b>gluten-free</b> products; these lawsuits claim children suffered severe intestinal damage {{as a result of}} unpublicized changes to McDonald's French fry recipe. McDonald's has provided a more complete ingredient list for its French fries more recently. Over 20 lawsuits {{have been brought}} against McDonald's regarding this issue, which the McDonald's Corporation has attempted to consolidate.|$|E
