5|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a freeway linking Scituate with suburban Warwick, the proposed alignment of Route 37 was later shortened to an alignment linking I-295 with I-95. Construction on the freeway began in 1963 and was completed by 1969. An eastward extension across upper Narragansett Bay was proposed in 1966; this proposal would have <b>extended</b> <b>Route</b> 37 north to I-195 and I-295 in Attleboro, Massachusetts, completing a beltway around the city of Providence. This <b>extended</b> <b>route</b> was approved and given the I-895 designation in 1968, but the extension was ultimately canceled by the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT). In the 1980s, Route 37 was included in proposals for an eastward extension of Interstate 84 from Hartford, Connecticut to Rhode Island, but this alignment was also canceled. RIDOT has long-range plans to extend Route 37 east to Route 117 in Downtown Warwick, but plans for a westward extension have been abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Bartlett's initial {{plan had}} been for the group to rest briefly on Wrangel Island and then to move on {{together}} to the Siberian coast. However, because three men—Mamen, Malloch and Maurer—were injured, and others were weak and frostbitten, Bartlett decided that the main party should remain on the island while he went for help taking only Kataktovik. The pair started off on 18 March, with seven dogs and provisions for 48 days (30 days for the dogs), and took an <b>extended</b> <b>route</b> round the island's southern shores to look for signs of Anderson's or Mackay's parties. After finding nothing, they headed across the ice towards Siberia, but progress was slow over a surface that was frequently shifting and breaking up to form leads of open water. More time was lost digging out their provisions from the steadily drifting snow. As they drew nearer to the mainland, Kataktovik became nervous; he had heard that the Alaskan Inuit were disliked in Siberia by the native Chukchi people, and feared for his life. Bartlett {{did his best to}} reassure him as they moved slowly forward.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, MTA <b>extended</b> <b>Route</b> 4 from Eastpoint Mall to White Marsh Mall through Essex and Rosedale, {{and south}} from the Dundalk loop to Turner's Station, and the route was {{slightly}} modified {{to serve the}} CCBC Dundalk campus. For the first time, single-seat bus service became available between the two CCBC east-side campuses.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, buses ran {{the route}} of the old tramline, {{terminating}} at Westminster Street. [...] Some services ran an <b>extended</b> <b>route</b> through to Weston Road, replacing the previous Weston Road via Springfield Road service. [...] A further extension of the route was implemented on 26 May 1958, with a new terminus at McFaddens Road. [...] The unsuitable nature of the land beyond McFaddens Road for residential development meant that the terminus remained unchanged for the next two decades.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{introduction}} of bus services, the old tram route was retained for most services but some ran an <b>extended</b> <b>route</b> to a new terminus {{at the intersection of}} Hoon Hay Road and Lewis Street to serve a rapidly growing residential area. [...] The route was split on 30 May 1960 when it was extended to a new terminus at Sparks Road/Victors Road and a terminus added at Halswell Road/Rowley Avenue. [...] As with the preceding tram service, this route was always combined with the Cranford Street route.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{indirect}} {{nature of the}} route to the central city, it maintained its popularity with local residents. [...] When the St. Albans Park tramline closed, the replacement bus service followed an <b>extended</b> <b>route</b> to the intersection of Philpotts Road and Ranger Street from 22 June 1953. [...] As {{this was also the}} terminus of the 18W service, its route was truncated at Cranford Street. [...] Just one month later following the replacement of the Cranford Street tramline with an extended bus route terminating at Weston Road on 27 July 1953, the 18W service was cancelled. [...] The number 18 buses resumed their original routes to Mays Road.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{appointment}} of Wing Captain Frederick Sykes to the command of Royal Naval Air Service units in the eastern Mediterranean in July 1915, plans {{were put in place}} for air reinforcements to be made available to Sykes. However, the landing at Suvla Bay began before the reinforcements arrived. [...] Nonetheless, Sykes's aviators did succeed in destroying several Ottoman ships which hindered the resupply of Ottoman troops. [...] This interdiction forced the Ottomans to depend on land resupply over an <b>extended</b> <b>route.</b> [...] While this did have a diminishing effect on Ottoman ammunition stocks, the failure to close the land routes meant that it was not decisive.|$|E

50|$|Alexander Huber bolted a 6 m shorter {{version of}} this route and first climbed it in 1994. Dani Andrada {{extended}} the route to reach an higher anchor, and his project was first climbed 9 years later (2003) by Ramón Julián Puigblanque, after more than forty failed attempts. Since then, all reptitions were made on the <b>extended</b> <b>route</b> and Huber's intermediate anchor was eventually removed. That's why the name La Rambla, which initially referred to Huber's route, is nowadays often improperly used to indicate the <b>extended</b> <b>route</b> as well.|$|E
50|$|Since Andrada just {{intended}} to restore, {{as much as}} possible, Huber's original project, his <b>extended</b> <b>route</b> is sometimes also called, quite misleadingly, La Rambla Original. An ambiguous name which should be probably avoided.|$|E

50|$|The Final Environmental Impact Statement for <b>extending</b> <b>Route</b> 11 {{was issued}} on October 26, 2007.
