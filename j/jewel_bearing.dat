50|$|By the 1970s, the Kamani {{group as}} {{it came to be}} known, {{consisted}} of seven companies with several manufacturing units in Bombay, Bhavnagar and Jaipur, and doing business in varied fields ranging from metals to rubber and chemicals to <b>jewel</b> <b>bearings</b> not to mention power, in both national and global markets.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, Adamant {{separated}} from Namiki Precision Jewel Co., Ltd. It started sales of <b>jewel</b> <b>bearings</b> for {{watches and clocks}} and began to manufacture cap jewel, hole jewel, impulse jewel and pallet stone.

50|$|A <b>jewel</b> <b>bearing</b> is a {{plain bearing}} {{in which a}} metal spindle turns in a jewel-lined pivot hole. The hole is {{typically}} shaped like a torus and is slightly larger than the shaft diameter. The jewel material is usually synthetic sapphire or ruby (corundum). Jewel bearings are used in precision instruments where low friction, long life, and dimensional accuracy are important. Their largest use is in mechanical watches.|$|E
50|$|Statistical {{methods of}} parts {{classification}} was one example {{used to reduce}} waste. If a gear staff (axle) and a <b>jewel</b> <b>bearing</b> hole were {{designed to be a}} given size, then the parts that most closely met those design goals were used in the highest grade watches. Accordingly, staffs that were too large would be matched to watch jewels with holes that were too large, and together they would be used on lower grade watches.|$|E

This type of donut-shaped bearing (red) is called a hole jewel, used {{for most of the}} ordinary wheels in the gear train. It is usually made of synthetic sapphire (ruby), press-fitted into a hole in the movement's supporting plate (grey). The cup-shaped depression {{in the top of the}} jewel is the oil cup; its purpose is to hold the lubricating oil (yellow) in contact with the bearing shaft by capillary action.|$|E
5000|$|Chronometers often {{included}} other innovations {{to increase}} their efficiency and precision. Hard stones such as diamond, ruby, and sapphire were often used as <b>jewel</b> <b>bearings</b> to decrease friction and wear of the pivots and escapement.

50|$|Namiki {{supplies}} industrial jewel parts such as <b>jewel</b> <b>bearings,</b> diamond cantilevers, watch exterior parts, and sapphire wafers {{which are}} made of synthetic sapphire which is produced in-house. They have developed sapphire step wafers, with a step height of 0.22 nanometres, which are expected to become the height standard for scanning probe microscopy (SPM), plus Immobilization plates for observing bio-materials.|$|R
50|$|In 1974, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in {{collaboration}} with the Swiss watch industry standards organization NIHS: Normes de l'Industrie Horlogère Suisse published a standard, ISO 1112, which prohibited manufacturers from including such nonfunctional jewels in the jewel counts in advertising and sales literature. This put a stop to the use of totally nonfunctional jewels. However, some experts say manufacturers have continued to inflate the jewel count of their watches by 'upjeweling'; adding functional <b>jeweled</b> <b>bearings</b> to wheels that do not really need them, exploiting loopholes in ISO 1112. Examples given include adding capstones to third and fourth wheel <b>bearings,</b> <b>jeweling</b> minute wheel <b>bearings,</b> and automatic winding ratchet pawls. Arguably none of these additions adds to the accuracy or longevity of the watch.|$|R
50|$|The next {{development}} for automatic watches came in 1948 from Eterna Watch. To wind a watch effectively, {{one of the}} chief requirements of a rotor is heft. Until this point, the best bearing used in any watch was a <b>jewel</b> <b>bearing,</b> which perfectly suits the small gears of a watch. A rotor, on the other hand, requires a different solution. In 1948, Eterna introduced the solution that is still in use today: ball bearings. Ball bearings provide robust support for a heavy object to rotate smoothly and reliably even under abnormal stress, such as if the watch were dropped.|$|E

5000|$|The Incabloc {{system uses}} a [...] "lyre-shaped" [...] spring {{to allow the}} {{delicate}} bearings to shift in their settings under impact, until a stronger shoulder of the staff contacts the strong metal endpiece, so that the pivots and bearings don't have to bear {{the force of the}} impact. When the impact is over, the springs guide the parts back to their original positions. The staff itself does not move relative to the <b>jewel</b> <b>bearing,</b> but the whole bearing is carried in a metal bushing that is free to move in the metal endpiece, {{under the control of the}} spring. Some modern balance wheels use a simpler arrangement, where, taking advantage of the low cost of modern synthetic rubies, a large jewel moves as its own mobile bushing.|$|E
50|$|Namiki Precision Jewel Co., Ltd. (Namiki Seimitu Houseki Kabushiki-gaisha) is a Japanese {{component}} {{manufacturing company}} based in Tokyo, Japan. The company was founded in 1939 as a manufacturer of synthetic sapphire <b>jewel</b> <b>bearings</b> for electrical measuring instruments. Namiki supplies industrial jewel parts, dc coreless and dc brushless motors, multi-functional vibration components, precision gearheads, medical equipment, watch exterior parts, and other precision components.|$|R
50|$|The pivots and <b>jewel</b> <b>bearings</b> {{that support}} a watch balance wheel are fragile in {{comparison}} to the mass they must support, and without shock protection are the part of the watch most likely to be damaged under impact. Before the widespread use of shock protection devices like Incabloc, broken balance staffs were a common type of damage requiring watch repair.|$|R
50|$|The {{other major}} use of <b>jeweled</b> <b>bearings</b> is in {{sensitive}} measuring instruments. They are typically used for delicate linkages that must carry very small forces, in instruments such as galvanometers, compasses, gyroscopes, gimbals, and turbine flow meters. Bearing bores are typically smaller than 1 mm and support loads weighing less than 1 gram, {{although they are}} made as large as 10 mm and may support loads up to about 500 g.|$|R
50|$|Fatio's most {{important}} invention was the <b>jewel</b> <b>bearing,</b> {{which is still}} used today in mechanical watches. To optimise the capture of solar energy, and thereby plant productivity, Fatio suggested in 1699 using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. He also studied the dilatation and contraction of the pupil of the eye, and described the fibres of the anterior uvea and the choroid {{in a letter to}} Mariotte, dated 13 April 1684. He introduced improvements in the fabrication of lenses for telescope. He showed how {{to take advantage of a}} ship's motion through the water to grind corn, saw, raise anchors, and hoist rigging. He also contrived a ship's observatory and measured the height of the mountains surrounding Geneva, planning, but never completing, a map of Lac Léman.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jewel</b> <b>bearings</b> {{were invented}} in 1704 {{for use in}} watches by Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, Peter Debaufre, and Jacob Debaufre, who {{received}} an English patent for the idea. Originally natural jewels were used, such as diamond, sapphire, ruby, and garnet. In 1902, a process to make synthetic sapphire and ruby (crystalline aluminium oxide, also known as corundum) was invented by Auguste Verneuil, making jewelled bearings much cheaper. Today most jewelled bearings are synthetic ruby or sapphire.|$|R

25|$|Switzerland's most {{important}} exports {{during the war}} were precision machine tools, watches, <b>jewel</b> <b>bearings</b> (used in bombsights), electricity, and dairy products. During World War Two, the Swiss franc was the only remaining major freely convertible currency in the world, and both the Allies and the Germans sold large amounts of gold to the Swiss National Bank.

The axial support was provided by <b>jewel</b> <b>bearings</b> {{on both ends of}} the rotor. The rig was successfully operated to speeds of 5500 rpm using an air impeller. Radial and axial stiffnesses of the permanent magnetic bearings were experimentally measured and then compared to finite element results. The natural damping of the rotor was measured and a damping coefficient was calculated...|$|R
2500|$|Optical or {{prismatic}} hand-bearing compass, {{most often}} used by surveyors, but also by cave explorers, foresters, and geologists. These compasses generally use a liquid-damped capsule and magnetized floating compass dial with an integral optical sight, often fitted with built-in photoluminescent or battery-powered illumination. [...] Using the optical sight, such compasses can be read with extreme accuracy when taking bearings to an object, often to fractions of a degree. Most of these compasses are designed for heavy-duty use, with high-quality needles and <b>jeweled</b> <b>bearings,</b> and many are fitted for tripod mounting for additional accuracy.|$|R
50|$|Chronometers often {{included}} other innovations {{to increase}} their efficiency and precision. Hard stones such as ruby and sapphire were often used as <b>jewel</b> <b>bearings</b> to decrease friction and wear of the pivots and escapement. Diamond was often used as the cap stone for the lower balance staff pivot to prevent wear from years of the heavy balance turning on the small pivot end. Until the end of mechanical chronometer production {{in the third quarter}} of the 20th century, makers continued to experiment with things like ball bearings and chrome-plated pivots.|$|R
50|$|In March 1705, Fatio {{exhibited}} {{specimens of}} watches thus jewelled to the Royal Society. The correspondence of Isaac Newton {{shows that in}} 1717 Fatio agreed to make a watch for Richard Bentley {{in exchange for a}} payment of £15, and that in 1724 he sought permission from Newton to use Newton's name in advertising his jewelled watches. Fatio's method for piercing rubies remained a speciality of English watchmaking until it was adopted in the Continent in 1768 by Ferdinand Berthoud. <b>Jewel</b> <b>bearings</b> are still used today in luxury mechanical watches.|$|R
