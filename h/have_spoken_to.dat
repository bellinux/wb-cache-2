5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{argued that}} Bamber {{had not received}} {{a telephone call from}} his father, that Nevill was too badly injured after the first shots to <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> anyone, that there was no blood on the kitchen phone that had been left off the hook, and that Nevill would have called the police before calling Bamber. They also argued that, had Bamber really received such a call, he would have dialled 999, alerted the farm workers, then made his way quickly there himself.|$|E
5|$|Firefighters {{extinguished}} {{the fires}} without any major {{damage to the}} school. Saari remained at large for {{some time in the}} school grounds after they had been evacuated. Two days after the killings, a friend of Saari's, named Rauno, told 7 päivää that at 11:53 he received a call from Saari in which he confessed to having killed ten people. Saari is claimed to <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Rauno in a calm manner, telling him that he wanted to say goodbye. He was found alive by the police at 12:30, having shot himself in the head. He was taken to Tampere University Hospital, where he was treated for his gunshot wound. He died a short time later at 17:40.|$|E

25|$|Although {{they may}} not <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> each other, Cobb and Crawford {{developed}} {{an uncanny ability to}} communicate non-verbally with looks and nods on the base paths. They {{became one of the most}} successful double steal pairings in baseball history.|$|E
25|$|We were skeptical, but {{everyone}} we <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> since– doctors, teachers, journalists, shopkeepers– has talked {{of a city}} transformed. Gone are the ubiquitous checkpoints where the warlords’ militias killed, extorted and stole. Gone are their technicals, Jeeps with heavy machine guns mounted on the back. The infamous Bakaro arms markets has been closed. The only guns and technicals now {{are those of the}} Sharia courts enforcers, and the reports of violence in the papers were of the Ipswich murders.|$|E
25|$|Anthony {{anticipated}} {{the rule of}} Benedict by about 200 years, engaging himself and his disciples in manual labor. Anthony himself cultivated a garden and wove rush mats. He and his disciples were regularly sought for words of enlightenment. These statements were later collected into the book of Sayings of the Desert Fathers. Anthony himself is said to <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> those of a spiritual disposition personally, leaving the task of addressing the more worldly visitors to Macarius. On occasions, {{he would go to}} the monastery {{on the outskirts of the}} desert by the Nile to visit the brethren, then return to his inner monastery.|$|E

60|$|Looking up at these, in statue-like silence, sat the pirate-chief. No one <b>had</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> him, and he <b>had</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> none {{since his}} entry there. Sleep did not visit his eyes, nor rest his heart, yet he sat {{perfectly}} still, hour after hour. Perchance he experienced the rest resulting from an iron will that abides its approaching time for action.|$|R
25|$|The Morelands <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> journalists, {{including}} Edward R. Murrow, {{about family}} {{life in a}} lighthouse that was still, at the time, a half-mile from the nearest land. The Coast Guard supplied them with water, so they no longer needed {{to rely on the}} cistern, although it was still kept full. It was necessary {{to go back to the}} land at least every two days for milk, and they bought groceries every two weeks. The couple could never go out together as one of them had to remain at the lighthouse at all times. During one power outage, Richard Moreland hung an emergency kerosene lamp in the lantern house and rang the fog bell himself.|$|E
25|$|Caffell {{had spent}} time in a {{psychiatric}} hospital being treated for schizophrenia months before the murders. The police believed that she was responsible until Bamber's girlfriend told them he had implicated himself. The prosecution case included {{that there was no}} evidence that Bamber's father had telephoned him. They argued that the father was too badly injured to <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> anyone; that there was no blood on the kitchen phone; and that he would have called the police, not Bamber. They also argued that the silencer was on the gun when the shots were fired, and that Caffell's reach was not long enough to hold the gun and silencer at her throat and press the trigger. In addition she was not strong enough, they said, to have overcome her father in what appeared to have been a violent struggle in the kitchen.|$|E
500|$|In 1873, Spanish novelist Antonio de Trueba {{published}} the purported reminiscences of Goya's gardener, Isidro, on {{the genesis of}} the series. de Trueba claims to <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Isidro in 1836, when the gardener recalled accompanying Goya to the hill of Principe Pio to sketch the victims of the executions of 3 May 1808. Goya scholars are sceptical of the account; Nigel Glendinning described it as a [...] "romantic fantasy", and detailed its many inaccuracies.|$|E

500|$|While a {{great many}} {{erroneous}} stories have circulated about the building, Addams is known to <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> several friends {{about one of the}} front bedrooms on the second floor being haunted – she and a friend once thought they saw a [...] "woman in white" [...] ghost there, and the same ghost was later seen by a group of girls when the room was used as a dressing room for the adjacent theater. Though Addams called it [...] "haunted," [...] she seems to have been more amused than frightened by it.|$|E
500|$|The {{king and}} his new queen enjoyed a {{reasonably}} happy accord with periods of calm and affection. Anne Boleyn's sharp intelligence, political acumen and forward manners, although desirable in a mistress, were, at the time, unacceptable in a wife. She was once reported to <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> her uncle in words that [...] "shouldn't be used to a dog". After a stillbirth or miscarriage as early as Christmas 1534, Henry was discussing with Cranmer and Cromwell the possibility of divorcing her without having to return to Catherine. Nothing came of the issue as the royal couple reconciled and spent summer 1535 on progress. By October, she was again pregnant.|$|E
500|$|According to Georgian intelligence, {{and several}} Russian media reports, {{parts of the}} regular (non-peacekeeping) Russian Army had already moved to South Ossetian {{territory}} through the Roki Tunnel before the Georgian military operation. Even the state-controlled Russian TV showed Abkhazia's de facto president Sergei Bagapsh on 7 August as saying: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> the president of South Ossetia. It has more or less stabilized now. A battalion from the North Caucasus District has entered the area." [...] Georgian officials did not announce Russian military incursion in public on 7 August since they relied on the Western advices {{and did not want}} to aggravate tensions. The entrance of second batch of Russian military through the Roki Tunnel during the night of 7/8 August pressured Georgian president Saakashvili to respond militarily after 23:00 in order to stop Russian full-scale invasion of Georgia near the Roki Tunnel before the Western reaction would be late.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{previously}} {{announcing his}} international retirement following the 2014 World Cup, Pirlo reversed his decision, and under new Italy manager, and Pirlo's former Juventus manager Antonio Conte, Pirlo {{returned to the}} Italian squad. On 10 October, Pirlo started in Italy's second Euro 2016 qualifying match, which ended in a 2–1 home win over Azerbaijan, overtaking Zoff with his 113th appearance for Italy. Pirlo assisted Chiellini's first goal of the match from a corner kick. In August 2015, Pirlo was called for Italy's Euro 2016 qualifying matches against Malta and Bulgaria in September; he appeared in Italy's 1–0 home victory over Malta on 3 September, becoming the first MLS player to represent Italy; this was his final international appearance. In total, Pirlo made four appearances under Conte, as Italy qualified for Euro 2016 on 10 October in a 3–1 win over Azerbaijan. On 23 May 2016, Pirlo, along with fellow MLS compatriot Giovinco, was left off of Conte's 30-player shortlist for Italy's Euro 2016 squad. Regarding their omission, Conte commented in a press conference: [...] "When you make a certain choice and go to play in certain leagues, you do so taking it into account that they could pay the consequences from a footballing viewpoint". In response to Conte's comments, Pirlo stated to Sky Italia: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Conte {{and there is no}} disappointment on my part, he knows {{what he has to do}} and what he should not do. We had discussions during the season and both parties made their own decisions. He is the coach and it's only right he makes his decisions and decides what is best for him. I hope Italy win although the favourites are other teams such as Germany, Spain and France." ...|$|E
2500|$|Then-Oasis {{leader and}} friend of Russell Brand, Noel Gallagher, complained that the press had [...] "dictated the tone" [...] of the controversy, and thought it [...] "typical of the English in general" [...] when [...] "10,000 people get outraged, but only days after it has happened". Gallagher claimed to <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Brand, who told Gallagher he was [...] "going to fall on his sword".|$|E

2500|$|On 7 August, {{state-owned}} Rossiya TV showed Sergei Bagapsh, {{the president}} of Abkhazia, speaking {{at a meeting of}} the Abkhaz National Security Council.
