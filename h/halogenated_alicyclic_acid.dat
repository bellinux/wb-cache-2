40|$|Anaerobic {{benzoate}} degradation by the phototrophic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris {{has been}} proposed to proceed via aromatic ring reduction reactions leading to cyclohex- 1 -ene- 1 -carboxyl-coenzyme A (CoA) formation. The alicyclic product is then proposed to undergo three β-oxidation-like modifications resulting in ring cleavage. Illuminated suspensions of benzoate-grown cells converted [7 - 14 C]cyclohex- 1 -ene- 1 -carboxylate to intermediates that comigrated with cyclohex- 1 -ene- 1 -carboxyl-CoA, 2 -hydroxycyclohexanecar-boxyl-CoA, 2 -ketocyclohexanecarboxyl-CoA, and pimelyl-CoA by thin-layer chromatography. This set of intermediates was also formed by cells grown anaerobically or aerobically on cyclohex- 1 -ene- 1 -carboxylate, indicating that benzoate-grown and cyclohex- 1 -ene- 1 -carboxylate-grown cells degrade this <b>alicyclic</b> <b>acid</b> by the same catabolic route. Four enzymatic activities proposed to be required for conversion of cyclohex- 1 -ene- 1 -carboxylate to pimelyl-CoA were detected at 3 - to 10 -fold-higher levels in benzoate-grown cells than in succinate-grown cells. These were cyclohex- 1 -ene- 1 -carboxylate-CoA ligase, cyclohex- 1 -ene- 1 -carboxyl-CoA hydratase, 2 -hydroxycyclohexanecarboxyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and 2 -ketocyclohexanecarboxyl-CoA hydrolase (ring cleaving).

40|$|<b>Alicyclic</b> bicyclic <b>acids</b> {{have been}} {{reported}} to be the major naphthenic acids (NA) in oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) but due to the extreme complexity of OSPW none have yet been identified. A previous study using the Microtox ™ assay indicated that some synthetic alicyclic bicyclics were the most acutely toxic acids tested so it is important that these compounds are identified and their toxicities determined. Using comprehensive multidimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCxGC-MS) we show that> 100 C 8 - 15 bicyclic acids are typically present in OSPW. Synthesis or purchase facilitated GCxGC retention times of methyl esters of these acids to be established and their mass spectra compared with unknowns. Having identified numerous <b>alicyclic</b> bicyclic <b>acids</b> by comparison with authentic standards, we suggest that many of the remaining unknowns are simply analogues of the identified acids with longer alkanoate chains and/or alkyl substituents. Previously we reported the predicted toxicities of a range of NA, many of which had been identified in OSPW, but the <b>alicyclic</b> bicyclic <b>acid</b> structures modelled had only been found in commercial NA mixtures or crude oil. Now, having identified numerous novel acids, we report their toxicities to Pimephales promelas (fathead minnow), the protozoan Tetrahymena pyriformis and the water flea Daphnia magna as predicted by Admet Predictor ™ (Simulations Plus). Also, neural network ensemble models were used to assess a compound's likelihood of binding to the estrogen or androgen receptors. Furthermore, the persistence of NA is a huge problem for the oil sands extraction industries so the likelihood of biodegradation was also modelled. Predicted LC 50 s for fathead minnows and water fleas were in the range 0. 01 – 3. 54 mmol/L and EC 50 s for T. pyriformis 0. 01 – 0. 7 mmol/L. As expected for this type of structure, no binding affinities for either estrogen or androgen receptors were predicted. Of the structures tested, about 30 % were considered not readily biodegradable as defined by the model based on biological oxygen demand and theoretical oxygen demand.

40|$|Thirty-three {{microorganisms}} {{capable of}} growth with cyclohexane carboxylate {{as the sole}} source of carbon were isolated from mud, water, and soil samples from the Aberystwyth area. Preliminary screening and whole-cell oxidation studies suggested that, with one exception, all of the strains metabolized the growth substrate by beta-oxidation of the coenzyme A ester. This single distinctive strain, able to oxidize rapidly trans- 4 -hydroxycyclohexane carboxylate, 4 -ketocyclohexane carboxylate, p-hydroxybenzoate, and protocatechuate when grown with cyclohexane carboxylate, was classified as a strain of Alcaligenes and given the number W 1. Enzymes capable of converting cyclohexane carboxylate to p-hydroxybenzoate were induced by growth with the <b>alicyclic</b> <b>acid</b> and included the first unambiguous specimen of a cyclohexane carboxylate hydroxylase. Because {{it is a very}} fragile protein, attempts to stabilize the cyclohexane carboxylate hydroxylase so that a purification procedure could be developed have consistently failed. In limited studies with crude cell extracts, we found that hydroxylation occurred at the 4 position, probably yielding the trans isomer of 4 -hydroxycyclohexane carboxylate. Simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidation, coupled with an assessment of reactant stoichiometry, showed the enzyme to be a mixed-function oxygenase. Mass spectral analysis enabled the conversion of cyclohexane carboxylate to p-hydroxybenzoate by cell extracts to be established unequivocally, and all of our data were consistent with the pathway: cyclohexane carboxylate → trans- 4 -hydroxycyclohexane carboxylate → 4 -ketocyclohexane carboxylate → p-hydroxybenzoate. The further metabolism of p-hydroxybenzoate proceeded by meta fission and by the oxidative branch of the 2 -hydroxy- 4 -carboxymuconic semialde-hyde-cleaving pathway...|$|R
40|$|A {{strain of}} Arthrobacter was {{isolated}} by enrichment culture with cyclohexaneacetate {{as the sole}} source of carbon and grew with a doubling time of 4. 2 h. In addition to growing with cyclohexaneacetate, the organism also grew with cyclohexanebutyrate at concentrations not above 0. 05 %, and {{with a variety of}} alicyclic ketones and alcohols. Oxidation of cyclohexaneacetate proceeded through formation of the coenzyme A (CoA) ester followed by initiation of a beta-oxidation cycle. beta-Oxidation was blocked before the second dehydrogenation step due to the formation of a tertiary alcohol, and the side chain was eliminated as acetyl-CoA by the action of (1 -hydroxycyclohexan- 1 -yl) acetyl-CoA lyase. The cyclohexanone thus formed was degraded by a well-described route that involves ring-oxygen insertion by a biological Baeyer-Villiger oxygenase. All enzymes of the proposed metabolic sequence were demonstrated in cell-free extracts. Arthrobacter sp. strain CA 1 synthesized constitutive beta-oxidative enzymes, but further induction of enzymes active toward cyclohexaneacetate and its metabolites could occur during growth with the <b>alicyclic</b> <b>acid.</b> Other enzymes of the sequence, (1 -hydroxycyclohexan- 1 -yl) acetyl-CoA lyase and enzymes of cyclohexanone oxidation, were present at negligible levels in succinate-grown cells but induced by growth with cyclohexaneacetate. The oxidation of cyclohexanebutyrate was integrated into the pathway for cyclohexaneacetate oxidation by a single beta-oxidation cycle. Oxidation of the compound could be divided into two phases. Initial oxidation to (1 -hydroxycyclohexan- 1 -yl) acetate could be catalyzed by constitutive enzymes, whereas the further degradation of (1 -hydroxycyclohexan- 1 -yl) acetate was dependent on induced enzyme synthesis which could be inhibited by chloramphenicol with the consequent accumulation of cyclohexaneacetate and (1 -hydroxycyclohexan- 1 -yl) acetate...|$|R

Assessment of the biological activity of the analogues of quercetin was carried out using whole cells and the kinase domain of the tyrosine protein kinase encoded by the Abelson murine leukaemia virus, ptab 150 kinase. Single cell suspension cultures and clonogenic potential of murine fibroblasts transformed by the Abelson Murine leukaemia virus (ANN- 1 cells) did not indicate the existence of any structure activity relationship required for cytotoxicity or cytostasis. No selective toxicity was apparent when the `normal' parent cell line, (3 T 3), was used to assess the cytotoxic potential of quercetin.

40|$|Naphthenic acids (NAs) are an {{important}} group of trace organic pollutants predominantly comprising saturated aliphatic and <b>alicyclic</b> carboxylic <b>acids.</b> NAs are ubiquitous; occurring naturally in hydrocarbon deposits (petroleum, oil sands, bitumen, and crude oils) and also have widespread industrial uses. Consequently, NAs can enter the environment from both natural and anthropogenic processes.

However, the diversity of microbial communities involved in NA-degradation, and the mechanisms by which NAs are biodegraded, are poorly understood. This lack of knowledge is mainly due to the difficulties in identifying and purifying individual carboxylic acid compounds from complex NA mixtures found in the environment, for microbial biodegradation studies. This paper will present an overview of NAs, their origin and fate in the environment, and their toxicity to the biota.

To better understand DOM mediation of carbonate precipitation and DOM co-precipitation and/or incorporation with carbonate minerals, we characterized the content and speciation of DOM in carbonate minerals and in the lake water of Pyramid Lake, Nevada, USA. A 400 -gram block of precipitated calcium carbonate from the Pyramid Lake shore was dissolved in 8 liters of 10 % acetic acid. Particulate matter not dissolved by acetic acid was removed by centrifugation. DOM from the carbonate rock was fractionated into nine portions using evaporation, dialysis, resin adsorption, and selective precipitations to remove acetic acid and inorganic constituents. The calcium carbonate rock contained 0. 23 % DOM by weight. This DOM was enriched in polycarboxylic proteinaceous acids and hydroxy-acids in comparison with the present lake water.

40|$|The acidity of N-acyl {{amino acids}} is {{dependent}} upon the rotameric state of the amide bond. In this work we systematically investigated the acidity difference of the rotamers (Delta pK(a)) in the frames of various acetylated amino acids. Our results indicated a mutual interaction of two carbonyl groups of an attractive type. We observed conservative Delta pK(a) s for acyclic amino acids (2. 2 - 3. 0 kJ mol(- 1)), whereas {{in the case of}} <b>alicyclic</b> amino <b>acids,</b> the experimental values revealed a strong dependency on the structural context (1. 5 - 4. 4 kJ mol(- 1)). In homologous amino acids (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, etc.), the strength of the attraction decays in an exponential fashion. Furthermore, the interaction can accumulate through a chain of amide bonds in a cascade fashion, as demonstrated by an Ac-Pro-Pro dipeptide. As a result, we demonstrate that Delta pK(a) is an experimental parameter to estimate increments in the carbonyl-carbonyl alignment, as determined by the amino acid or peptidyl context. This parameter is also important in understanding the roles of amino acids in both protein folding and translation in biological systems as well as their evolutionary appearance in the genetic code.

40|$|Deciphering the {{molecular}} codes of {{dissolved organic matter}} (DOM) improves our understanding of {{its role in the}} global element cycles and its active involvement in ecosystem services. This study demonstrates comprehensive characterization of DOM by an initial polarity-based stepwise solid phase extraction (SPE) with single methanol elution of the cartridges, but separate collection of equal aliquots of eluate. The reduction of molecular complexity in the individual DOM fractions attenuates intermolecular interactions and substantially increases the disposable resolution of any structure selective characterization. Suwannee River DOM (SR DOM) was used to collect five distinct SPE fractions with overall 91 % DOC recovery. Optical spectroscopy (UV and fluorescence spectroscopy), high-field Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry (FTICR MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy showed analogous hierarchical clustering among the five eluates corroborating the robustness of this approach. Two abundant moderately hydrophobic fractions contained most of the SR DOM compounds, with substantial proportions of aliphatics, carboxylic-rich alicyclic molecules, carbohydrates and aromatics. A minor early eluting hydrophilic fraction was highly aliphatic and presented a large diversity of <b>alicyclic</b> carboxylic <b>acids,</b> whereas the two late eluting, minor hydrophobic fractions appeared as a largely defunctionalized mixture of aliphatic molecules. Comparative mass analysis showed that fractionation of SR DOM was governed by multiple molecular interactions depending on O/C ratio, molecular weight and aromaticity. The traditional optical indices SUVA 254 and fluorescence index (FI) indicated the relative aromaticity in agreement with FTICR mass and NMR spectra; the classical fluorescent peaks A and C were observed in all four latter eluates.

40|$|Amongst {{the polar}} organic {{compounds}} occurring in unrefined and refined crude oils {{and the associated}} polluted production waters, complex mixtures of acids, known historically as naphthenic acids (NAs), have achieved prominence. This is particularly because NAs have been designated a toxicant class of concern in the oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) that has accumulated in vast quantities following exploitation of the oil sands of Northern Alberta, Canada in recent years. However, though there have been calls for NAs {{to be added to}} pollutant inventories, at the initiation of the current study, little knowledge existed of the exact composition of refined or unrefined NAs. The overall aim of the current study was therefore to identify individual NAs in refined (commercial) and unrefined (e. g. oil sands process-derived) complex mixtures of acids and then to assess the toxicity of any identified NAs. Individual NAs were tentatively identified by interpretation of the electron ionisation mass spectra of methyl ester derivatives, following comprehensive multidimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCxGC-MS). Reference acids were then either purchased, or more commonly, where they were not commercially-available, synthesised, mainly by micro-hydrogenation methods, for co-chromatography and comparison of mass spectra of methyl esters with those of unknowns. The synthetic NAs, purified to > 97 % were then subjected to toxicological assessments using the Microtox™ assay. In all, 34 compounds were obtained pure enough for testing. Microtox results revealed that the toxicity endpoint (50 % Inhibition Concentration, IC 50) was between 0. 004 and 0. 7 mM. Exponential and other correlations were noted between carbon number and toxicity in several of the structural groups of acids assayed, which may be beneficial for predictions of toxicity of non-synthesised acids. Although n-hexanoic acid (IC 50 0. 7 mM) had the lowest toxicity, adamantane-type acids were the least toxic as a group overall. Conversely, the decahydronaphthalene (decalin) -type acids had the largest range of toxicities (IC 50 0. 004 to 0. 3 mM) and the most toxic acid assayed was 3 -decalin- 1 -yl-propanoic acid. According to USEPA guidelines many individual acids can be said to show low to medium toxicity. Since the acids in commercial and unrefined NAs occur in complex mixtures, an attempt was also made to assess mixture toxicity. Mixtures of individual structural groups of acids (e. g. acyclic isoprenoid acids, n-acids) and a mixture of all 34 acids were assessed. Apart from the adamantane sub-group of acids, all of the mixtures showed toxicities lower than the sum of the parts when calculated using equations for Concentration Addition and Model Deviation Ratios (simply the predicted IC 50 /Observed IC 50). A hypothesis that achievement of a critical micelle concentration is required to produce toxicity was proposed to explain the lower than expected results. Some of the mass spectra of NA present in the commercial and unrefined mixtures were inconsistent with those of any of the <b>alicyclic</b> <b>acids</b> synthesised or purchased. These were hypothesised to be aromatic acids. Fractionation experiments of the NA mixtures using silver ion thin layer chromatography and solid phase extraction (Ag+TLC and Ag+SPE) were carried out in order to provide further evidence for aromatic acids. Ag+TLC allowed separation of a methylated NA mixture from OSPW into three distinct fractions; Ag+SPE resulted in eleven fractions, {{through the use of a}} wider range of solvents and differential solvent ratios. Analysis of the fractions by GC-MS revealed that each fraction was largely still made up of unresolved acids (as esters), although one or two fractions revealed some resolved acids. Use of averaged mass spectra and mass chromatography on each fraction revealed further resolved chromatographic peaks and associated interpretable mass spectra. Each of eight of the eleven sub-fractions were examined by GC-MS, in some cases by GCxGC-MS, and all by infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry and elemental analysis. A number of structures were proposed for the aromatic acids, including those with sulphur-containing moieties. It was noted that far from being minor components, aromatic acids comprised ca. 25 - 40 % of the OSPW acid extracts...|$|R

40|$|The definition, {{occurrence}} and aetiology of hypomagnesaemic tetany {{is discussed}} as {{an introduction to}} the practical implications of the present investigation. The current hypotheses, involving an unfavourable pasture chemical composition, accounting for the binding of Ca++ and Mg++ in the intestinal tract of ruminants are reviewed. The role of undigested or partly-digested plant cell wall materials is advanced as another such hypothesis, and the present investigation of the cell wall polymers of a typical pasture grass is outlined. The comprehensive analysis of the grass Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus) involves, initially, the extraction and purification of pectic substances, lignin, hemicelluloses and cellulose. The non-volatile organic acid content of the grass is also determined. Analytical methods are developed and evaluated in order to assess the homogeneity of these isolated cell wall fractions, and their chemical constitution investigated to aid in determining any possible relationship between cation complexing and polymer (or monomer) structure. The pectic fraction isolated from Yorkshire fog is approximately 90 % polygalacturonic acid while the hemicelluloses are basically arabinoxylans with varying hexose and uronic acid content. Attempts tofractionate the predominant hemicellulose, hemicellulose B, into homogenous arabinoxylans gives inconclusive results. Most of the chemical evidence, however, indicates the presence of three discreet polysaccharides in this fraction - a simple arabinoxylan, an acidic galactoarabinoxylan and a neutral glucan. Infrared and ultraviolet spectroscopy is utilised to determine the purity of the isolated lignin as well as the presence of typical lignin functional groups. Yorkshire fog lignin has a moderate phenolic hydroxyl and -OMe content and, like most other monocotyledonous lignins, gives yields of syringaldehyde, vanillin and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde on alkaline nitrobenzene oxidation. The outstanding feature of the lignin is its appreciable content of etherified hydroxyl groups in the 4 -position of the aromatic ring and the low yield of syringaldehyde. The water-soluble, non-volatile organic acids are quantitatively determined by anion-exchange resin chromatography and their identity confirmed by paper chromatography. The major acid is the tricarboxylic acid, trans-aconitic acid, which is determined spectrophotometrically. The normal plant acids, citric and malic, are present in moderate quantities while the <b>alicyclic</b> <b>acids,</b> quinic anc shikimic, are only present in minor amounts. A limited amount of data on the seasonal fluctuation of these organic fractions in Yorkshire fog is presented. Electrolytes and the concept of ionic activity are discussed in the introduction {{to the study of the}} ability of these plant fractions to bind Ca++ and Mg++ in an aqueous salt solution of cationic composition similar to that of the intestine of a ruminant. A cation exchange method is developed whereby changes in the activity of Ca++ or Mg++ on the introduction of a plant fraction into the salt solution are reflected in the cationic composition of the equilibrium resin. An investigation is undertaken of a large number of calibration solutions varying in [ca++] and[Mg++], but constant in [Na+], [K+] and [NH 4 +], the latter cations being present in excess as 'swamping' cations. Regression expressions relating solution cation concentration to the equilibrium resin cation concentrations are derived and used as calibration equations to determine the amounts of bound and ionic Ca++ and Mg++ in solutions in equilibrium with the plant fractions. The pectic substances, lignin and the organic acids are effective in complexing a large proportion of the solution Ca in a non-ionic form but only lignin and the organic acids display a significant complexing of solution Mg++. Except for hemicellulose B (branched) at a slightly alkaline pH, the hemicelluloses and cellulose have little ability to complex either Ca++ or Mg++. The complexing results are discussed in terms of the relationship of polymer structure to observed cation affinity. Factors involved in cation binding are: - the charge and degree of hydration of the cation itself; - distribution and degree of esterification of carboxyl groups in the polymer; - monomer conformation; - type of glycosidic linkage in the polymer; - the possibility of hydrogen-bonding and non-bonded interactions between substituents on the polymers; - solution pH. The in vivo implications of the results are finally discussed in the context of general ruminant nutrition and alkaline-earth metal absorption discussed in the introduction...|$|R

The acidity of these oils is due to the presence of a class of compounds known as Naphthenic Acids (NAs) which are thought to arise from the biodegradation of some of the crude oil hydrocarbons. Some oils contain as much as 3 % by weight NAs. The acids cause engineering and production difficulties through corrosion of refinery plant and deposition as salts in pipelines. NAs also cause environmental problems because they are known toxicants. For example, the processing of the vast tar sands deposits of Alberta, Canada results in tailings pond waters containing very high concentrations of NAs. The ponds are estimated to exceed a billion m³ by 2025 and are already visible from space. Bioremediation is an attractive option for reducing the toxicity of such NA wastes. However, an understanding of the biodegradation potential of NAs has previously been hindered by the lack of knowledge of the molecular structure of individual NAs and by the lack of appropriate suitable surrogate acids for detailed mechanistic studies. Although it is known that NAs are complex mixtures of alkyl substituted, mainly <b>alicyclic,</b> carboxylic <b>acids</b> fitting the general formula CaH 2 n-zO 2, where Z denotes the hydrogen deficiency resulting from ring formation, beyond this, comparatively little was known of NA chemistry, prior to the present study. The current study describes the synthesis of a series of novel monocyclic surrogate NAs containing both alkyl and alkanoate side-chains (viz: butylcyclohexylbutanoic acids, BCHBAs). The branching in the butyl chain was varied in a systematic way from n-through sec-, iso- and tert-butyl. The surrogates were synthesised in high purity (> 94 %) and rigorously characterised at each synthetic stage by various spectroscopic techniques. A toxicity assay in which developing oyster (Crassostrea gigas) embryos were inoculated with the individual monocyclic surrogate NAs demonstrated EC 50 (Effective Concentrations for 50 % of population) values ranging from 0. 11 mg Lˉ¹ to 0. 49 mg Lˉ¹. The results exhibited a clear quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) between the degree of branching in the alkyl chain and the toxic effect, with the less branched NAs exhibiting the highest toxicity. A detailed biodegradation study of the monocyclic surrogate NAs was made. Again a clear QSAR was established. In this instance, n-BCHBA was the most readily degraded with 97 % degradation by day 9, and tert-BCHBA the most resistant with only 2 % degradation by day 30, whereas iso-BCHBA and sec-BCHBA were 77 % and 53 % degraded after 30 days, respectively. The degradation of the monocyclic surrogate NAs proceeded with the production of major metabolites consistent with β-oxidation of the alkanoic acid side chain. The metabolites were tentatively identified by mass spectrometry as the ethanoic acid analogues of the butanoic acids. These resisted further biodegradation. That biodegradation proceeded via β-oxidation was confirmed by the synthesis and subsequent biodegradation additional methyl branch in the butanoic acid side chain effectively halted biodegradation. The QSAR observed in the toxicity and biodegradation experiments is thought {{to be related to the}} hydrophobicity of the individual NA surrogates, which determines their bioavailability. These results with surrogate compounds help to explain previous reports of the biodegradation of natural NAs in which reductions in toxicity during initial biodegradation have been observed. The surrogate NAs synthesised herein were also used to devise a unique derivatisation procedure which then facilitated the analysis of synthetic and natural NAs by liquid chromatography-multistage mass spectrometry (LC-MS"). Analysis of the resulting naphthenic amides (NAds) allowed an improvement in detection of over two orders in magnitude by positive ion electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) compared to negative ion ESI-MS. The improved response allowed multistage LC-ESI-MS" experiments to be carried out and detailed mass spectral fragmentation pathways for individual NAds to be deduced. Analysis of derivatised natural NA mixtures then allowed a more detailed molecular characterisation of individual NAs than has been possible hitherto. The use of the surrogate NAs synthesised herein has thus improved significantly our understanding of NA chemistry and the influence of NA structure on the potential for NA bioremediation...|$|R
