40|$|The {{success of}} {{modelling}} partially magnetised linear 3 -port <b>junction</b> <b>circulator,</b> which is non-uniformly biased, depends chiefly on the precise {{representation of the}} strength of the intrinsic magnetic field in the axial direction across the ferrite material placed at the centre of the junction. The inadequateness of using conventional Polder tensor, which is established with the assumption that the ferrite material is saturated by a constant uniform magnetic field, in modelling partially and non-uniformly magnetised 3 -port ferrite junction circulators is presented. It is proposed that the combination of static and microwave finite element (FE) solver overcomes the limit of Polder tensor in modelling partially and non-uniformly magnetised ferrite <b>junction</b> <b>circulator.</b> The proposed combination method requires the generation of the steady magnetic field in a magnetostatic solver, where the magnetic state of the ferrite material is determined, and the information of the static magnetic field of ferrite junction is transferred to the microwave solver for use in the microwave permeability tensor of the partially magnetised ferrite junction. Using the coupling method, the reflection coefficient responses of the 3 -port ferrite <b>junction</b> <b>circulator</b> are determined in the low field loss region which coincides with the partially magnetised region and accompanies a few undesirable problems in communication systems, such as the reduction of bandwidth, and intermodulation product interference. The determined reflection coefficient is used to obtain the split frequencies which are important in designing and analysing the performance of a 3 -port ferrite circulator in partially magnetised region. The main modelling factors considered are the effects from the number of mesh, the type of the magnetic field, the biasing configurations and the value of the dielectric constant. In each case, various split frequencies are obtained and, by considering all factors step by step, optimal modelling conditions are decided. The modelling results are compared with the experiment and show good agreement. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{for the first}} time a systematic algorithm to optimise the bandwidth for a semiconductor <b>junction</b> <b>circulator</b> with minimum magnetic bias requirements. The behaviour of the gyroelectric parameters was studied to describe the optimum biasing magnetic field for millimetre wave operation with maximum bandwidth. Perfect circulation conditions derived using a Green’s function approach were analysed to determine the optimum radius and coupling half-angle for the semiconductor disk forming the circulator. Previously measured data for InSb at 77 K were used to find design parameters for optimum bandwidth of circulation at millimetre wave frequencies. The performance of the design was verified using a full-wave electromagnetic simulation package, where up to 90 % 10 dB bandwidth centred at 200 GHz was achieved with magnetic biasing as low as 0. 214 T. 1...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT We {{analyze the}} {{properties}} of magneto-optical de-fect states in two-dimensional photonic crystals. With out-of-plane magnetization, the magneto-optical coupling splits doubly-degenerate TE states into two counter-rotating modes at different frequencies. The strength of magneto-optical cou-pling strongly depends on the spatial overlap of the cav-ity domain structures and the cross product of the modal fields. The transport property of the resultant nonreciprocal states is demonstrated in a <b>junction</b> <b>circulator</b> structure with a magneto-optical cavity coupled to three waveguides. By a proper matching of the magneto-optical frequency splitting with the cavity decay rate into the waveguide, ideal three-port circulator characteristics with complete isolation and trans-mission can be achieved, with an operational bandwidth pro-portional to the magneto-optical constant. The proposed op-tical circulator in a bismuth-iron-garnet/air photonic crystal is demonstrated with finite-difference time-domain calcula-tions and is compared to an alternative implementation of silicon/air crystal infiltrated with a single bismuth-iron-garnet domain.

A reliable solid-state transmitter which delivers the necessary power over a wide bandwidth using the present IMPATT diode technology required the development of combining techniques.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a class of}} new easy-to-fabricate ferrite–sphere-based waveguide Y-junction circulators for po-tentially low-cost millimeter-wave applications. A new three-dimensional modeling strategy using a self-inconsistent mixed-coordinates-based modal field-matching procedure is developed to characterize electrical performance of the proposed circulator. It is found that the circulating mechanism of the ferrite–sphere post is different from its full-height ferrite counterpart in that the new structure operates in a turnstile fashion with reso-nant characteristics, while the conventional device operates on a transmission cavity model. Extensive comparable studies between the new and conventional circulators are made {{to show that the}} electrical behaviors of the new structure are also distinct and radial power-density profiles are not stationary, {{as in the case of}} the full-height ferrite post circulator for different geo-metrical parameters. Results obtained by the analysis technique are compared with the available results for a full/partial-height ferrite circulator, showing an excellent agreement. Our calculated and measured results are also presented for W-band circu-lators with the proposed ferrite–sphere technique, indicating some interesting characteristics such as the frequency offset behavior of the isolation and reflection curves. In addition, radial power-density profiles are plotted inside and outside the ferrite sphere to illustrate its intrinsic circulating mechanism, as well as its difference, as compared to its full-height ferrite structure.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 24 - 25) This thesis develops {{and makes}} use of the planar method of analysis to treat the above-resonance direct-coupled <b>junction</b> <b>circulator.</b> This particular type of design utilizes open-circuited stubs symmetrically disposed between the ports of the circulator. The device is commercially useful because of its small size; {{a result of its}} direct-coupled properties. The planar method is a numerical analysis based on a Kirchhoff formulation involving a contour integral which has been reduced to matric form. The method is completely developed in the appendices where particular care has been exercised to define and formulate the equations. The method is used to analyze four different circulator geometries, three of which have previously been analyzed by more classical methods. Input admittance data for the two methods of attack are compared and demonstrate reasonable correlation. In particular, the shift to lower frequencies, the increase in bandwidth, and the requirement for less biasing field are clearly evident when optimal stubs are added. The fourth geometry is composed of fully intersecting strip-lines and is devoid of the central circular disk used in the other three. This configuration is more typical of those used in practice. Its analysis is less amenable to classical methods but is easily handled by planar methods. As such, it demonstrates the power of the planar approach to handle arbitrary geometries. Results of the analysis indicate that the method is capable of predicting performance reasonably close to measured results; however, additional work is indicated in order to attain an even better correspondence with measured data...|$|E
