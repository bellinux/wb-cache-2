It can also be distinguished from the Arctic ringlet {{by the fact that it}} always has eyespots on its hindwings while the upperside of the Arctic ringlet's wings are plain brown. Another very similar species is the <b>dewy</b> <b>ringlet,</b> but that has a more rusty red forewing and the red strip along the underside of the wings is not continuous.|$|R
