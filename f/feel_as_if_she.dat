She holidayed in the town {{as a child and}} remarked in an interview that while everything else in her life had changed, her mother and Southwold had remained the same.

6000|$|... "Tremendously; {{the deck}} seems almost upright, {{and the water}} right under our feet each time she goes over. <b>She</b> <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were going to turn topsy-turvy each roll. It's bad enough on deck; {{but it will be}} worse down below." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There has SHE,' {{indicating}} his wife, {{been thinking}} it her duty {{to read the}} old Italian one, which I never opened in my life.

60|$|Lady de la Poer {{was so much}} amused, {{that she}} could not answer at first; and Kate began to <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had been talking foolishly, and turned her back to wash her hands.|$|E
60|$|She {{went into}} the front garden, feeling too heavy to take herself out, yet unable to stay indoors. The heat suffocated her. And looking ahead, the {{prospect}} of her life made her <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were buried alive.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} she {{accompanied}} Violet to call on Lady Fotheringham, sullen, proud, and bashful at the sense of undergoing inspection, and resolved against showing her best side, lest she should <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was winning Worthbourne for Percy.|$|E

6000|$|The hostess {{is smiling}} resolutely {{through all the}} courses, smiling through her agony; though her heart is in the kitchen, and she is speculating with terror lest there be any {{disaster}} there. If the SOUFFLE should collapse, or if Wiggins does not send the ices in time--she <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would commit suicide--that smiling, jolly woman! ...|$|R
60|$|She {{absolutely}} did not <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{were the}} same Lucilla. It was the sensation of doubt on her personal identity awakened in the good woman of the ballad when her little dog began to bark and wail at her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not know}} we were Scotch; papa never said {{anything}} about it, or seemed to care about Scotland, except to have me sing the old ballads," [...] said Rose, beginning to <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had left America behind her somewhere.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said {{my mother}} hesitatingly.

60|$|The buccaneers {{were afraid}} of nothing; they paid no {{attention}} to the rules of war,--a little ship would attack a big one without the slightest hesitation, and more than that, would generally take it,--and in every way Spain was beginning to <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were acting the part of provider to the pirate seamen of every nation.|$|E
60|$|The half-indignant {{tone of the}} {{man made}} his guest <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had insulted him; and she obeyed with a docility which appeased his anger at once.

6000|$|... "They {{will have}} to help it, or I'll drown the lot. This is a rare breed, and I've but two left after all my trouble, thanks to that rascal of yours!

6000|$|... "Well, {{she does}} it so imperceptibly that I don't think I shall mind much. She {{is the sort of}} woman who knows how to rule well.
