An automated Rayleigh-Ritz method is adopted to evaluate the natural frequencies and the mode shapes of the structures. A proposed unified set of Ritz functions is used to span the displacement fields of various types and combinations of end boundary conditions. Comparison and convergence studies are carried out to verify and establish the appropriate number of Ritz functions to produce results with an acceptable order of accuracy. Shells with any number of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports</b> and any combination of end boundary conditions can be analyzed by the proposed method. Effects of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports</b> and their locations on natural frequencies of the shells are studied and the results presented for easy access by design engineers...|$|R

40|$|In {{article was}} {{formulated}} and {{solved the problem}} of conditional nonlinear optimization of the distance between inter-mediate supports during {{the design of the}} cable metro lines in highly urbanized environment, taking into account not the horizontal surface of the terrain. The optimization problem involves a single-criterion objective function that expresses the cost of construction of the cable metro line (total cost of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports</b> and their foundations, traction and carrying steel cables and technical equipment). The specified objective function subject to minimization by finding the optimal combination of the distance between <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports</b> and tension carrying ropes with accounting con-structive, modal, structural and planning constraints in the form of nonlinear inequalities. When constructing the objec-tive function were considered three possible forms sagging of carrying ropes, which can be implemented for various values of the efforts of their tension. Analysis was done of the influence of the angle of the longitudinal slope of the surface relief along the line of the cable metro on the value of the optimal distance between <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports</b> de-pending on the design and cost of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports</b> and at the cost of 1 km line of the cable metro. Quantitative calculations showed that with the increase of the longitudinal slope of the surface construction cost also increases with nonlinear increasing rate. The dependence of the cost of 1 km of line underground cable metro from the parameters of the relief is of extreme character with a pronounced minimum at small angles of inclination of the terrain surface about 3 [...] . 60 degrees. The position of the minimum is quite stable and only slightly changes when enough significant change in the cost of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports</b> and installed on them technological equipment. The most effective conditions for the construction of the cable metro is the terrain with considerable differences in altitude {{along the length of the}} route of transport: only if the surface inclination of more than 50 [...] . 60 degrees cost of 1 km line starts to exceed the cost of 1 km line laid along a strictly horizontal surface. At small angles of inclination of the surface (less than 6 [...] . 8 degrees) to min-imize the cost of construction of the cable metro line requires more frequent installation of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports.</b> How-ever, despite the possibility of building a lower and cheaper supports, the observed increased values of the cost of 1 km of optimum option of the line. At large angles of inclination of the surface a need for a more rare setup higher interme-diate supports. Within the tilt angle 10 [...] . 60 degrees the range of variation of the optimal step is small enough, amount-ing to no more than ± 10 % from the value of the step at an angle of inclination of the surface 10 degree. In the range of small angles of inclination of the terrain surface (3 [...] . 6 degrees) observed abrupt changes in the basic technical and eco-nomic characteristics of the cable metro lines. This is due to the change of the forms sagging of load-bearing ropes. The increase in the number of supporting ropes has a very small economic effect (within 4 %). It does not change the opti-mal characteristics of such line, as a step of the installation and the height of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports,</b> shape and sagging boom carrying ropes. However, the significantly reduced diameter of the supporting rope and the horizontal force ten-sion. The increase in aggregate strength of carrying ropes provides a directly proportional increase in the optimal step installation of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports</b> and leads to a marked decrease in the cost of construction of the cable metro lines. At the height of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports</b> and the horizontal force of the tension carrying ropes of their aggregate strength influence practically does not, however, leads to a significant reduction in the required diameter of the supporting ropes. It also has a positive effect on reducing the cost characteristics of the construction cable metro line. The capacity of the line cable metro has a significant impact on the optimal values of some of its basic technical and economic characteris-tics, in particular, the cost of 1 km line, the step to install <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports,</b> tension and diameter of the supporting ropes. Its increase is possible by increasing the allowed speed passenger cabins and (or) their capacity and quantity. In all these cases, increasing capacity causes the increase in the cost of 1 km of line and the reduction step of the installa-tion of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports.</b> The degree of influence these areas of increasing capacity is not the same, which suggests the presence for the given value of the theoretical capacity of an optimal combination of speed, capacity and number of passenger cabins, which will be achieved the greatest technical and economic effect during the construction of the cable metro line...|$|R

5000|$|The {{collapse}} of the Chain Bridge was a great inconvenience for the village of Falls of Schuylkill, with the nearest bridge being [...] "The Colossus", five miles downstream. Josiah White seems to have used the Chain Bridge {{as the model for}} his wire footbridge, substituting iron wire for Finley's iron chains."White & Hazard had two mills on the western side of the river, - one a saw-mill, the other a mill for making white lead. The wire-mills were {{on the east side of}} the river. There were two buildings at one time. On one of the occasions of the breaking down of the Falls Chain bridge, White & Hazard erected a curious temporary bridge across the river by suspending wires from the top windows of their mill to large trees on the western side, which wires hung in a curve, and from which were suspended other wires supporting a floor of boards eighteen inches m wide. The length of the floor of this bridge was four hundred feet m, without <b>intermediate</b> <b>support.</b> The entire cost was one hundred and twenty-five dollars. They charged a toll of one cent per passenger, and when, from that revenue, the cost of the structure was realized they made the structure free.""Notice was given that only eight persons would be allowed on it at a time, but 'A Visitor,' writing to the Pennsylvania Gazette, said that he 'saw thirty people on it at a time, including rude boys running backward and forward.'"

40|$|The {{comercial}} thinning of second-growth {{stands in}} the Pacific Northwest is becoming increasingly important for satisfying the demand for timber. Cable logging will require the rigging of smaller <b>intermediate</b> <b>support</b> trees rather than those utilized on old-growth timber sales. This paper reports {{on the results of}} a study designed to evaluate the ability of second-growth trees to sustain the compressive forces similar to those generated by a cable logging system. The movements of nine trees subjected to increasing amounts of force were measured with two theodolites. The conditions of loading were similar to those imposed on <b>intermediate</b> <b>support</b> trees. The study demonstrates that a tree will continue to move in the direction of its initial lateral movement. Once a tree is bent, the downward compressive force governs the movement of the tree. The results from the study are compared to Euler's design formula. It is suggested that a factor of safety be applied when designing an <b>intermediate</b> <b>support.</b> Additional research is proposed by the author to determine the forces acting on support trees during the actual yarding cycle...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Presentation date: 1988 - 09 - 02 Multispan skyline logging {{systems are}} cable systems {{designed}} to yard logs over steep terrain having a constant or convex slope. An intermediate skyline support {{is used to}} raise the skyline high enough to achieve ground clearance without overstressing the skyline. Certain improvements in performance can be realized by providing <b>intermediate</b> <b>support</b> for the mainline {{as well as the}} skyline. A computer model has been developed to compare the performance of two possible suspended-mainline multispan logging systems. One of the systems is capable of suspending the mainline at the skyline <b>intermediate</b> <b>support</b> using a compound jack, and the other, the squirrel carriage, suspends the mainline from a pair of sheaves which are free to change location under the influence of cable forces. The computer model is capable of predicting the effect of different parameters on the performance of the logging systems. Simulations on a typical logging setting, varying one parameter at a time, suggest that: (1) Either system of suspending the mainline can potentially improve net payload, ground clearance of the mainline, and the likelihood of successful passage of the skyline carriage over the <b>intermediate</b> <b>support</b> jack. (2) The compound jack system is capable of better performance than the squirrel carriage system under most conditions.
