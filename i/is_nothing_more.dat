5|$|In {{the fifth}} season premiere, Blair {{continues}} to plan her wedding, but begins to encounter problems in {{her relationship with}} Louis. It is later revealed that she is pregnant. Blair tells Chuck {{that the child is}} Louis', and states that part of her wanted Chuck to be the father. Dan becomes Blair's confidante and is shown to be in love with her, though she remains oblivious to his feelings and states that there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than friendship between them.|$|E
5|$|From there, Crash {{crosses to}} the second of Cortex's islands. Wumpa Island, hosting a large tree, has been long {{abandoned}} and there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than a jungle, a lizard-infested city, dilapidated bridges high in the mountains, and the ruins of an ancient temple. However, having discovered that Crash is making {{his way across the}} islands, Cortex dispatches the deranged Ripper Roo on the island in a temple {{at the start of a}} creek. Crash manages to cross the river and, after avoiding contact with his razor-sharp toenails, knocks Ripper Roo out cold beside a waterfall, and successfully makes his way through the city and the temples. Crash also defeats another of Cortex's mutants, the muscular Koala Kong, in a volcanic cave mine before finally crossing to the Cortex Island. Crash then navigates the Cortex Power station, a huge power plant that provides Cortex's castle with energy while polluting the nearby area. When he reaches the factory core, Crash battles and defeats the CEO of Cortex Power, Pinstripe Potoroo, damaging the power plant.|$|E
5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of a thing is the thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E

5|$|Just as the Jeddah Tower will {{complement}} the Jeddah Economic City development {{that will be}} built around it, there are many infrastructure and revitalization projects underway and planned throughout Saudi Arabia, such as the US$7.2 billion (SR27.1 billion) new airport terminal under construction at King Abdulaziz (Jeddah) International Airport, that will {{complement the}} Jeddah Economic City as well as develop Saudi Arabia, which has been likened to a Third World country with crumbling infrastructure and widespread disasters, including severe flooding, such as the flash floods in early 2011 that damaged 90% of the roads and over 27,000 buildings in Jeddah. According to a representative of Standard Chartered, which invested US$75 million in Saudi Binladin Group, Saudi Arabia is going to spend over US$400 billion (SR1.5 trillion) on infrastructure {{over the next few}} years. According to reports by Citi Investment Research & Analysis, $220 billion worth of development, accounting for 36% of all construction spending in the MENA region, will be directly or indirectly beneficial to Jeddah Tower. Jeddah Tower and City themselves are intended to set an example of green development, using modern technology and having a low carbon footprint relative to the number of people they will support. However, there is also an increasing problem of poor education levels in Arab countries {{due to a lack of}} spending in research and education, which it is argued should be invested in rather than building skyscrapers, and that the tower <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than a symbol of hubris. It has even been likened to the Tower of Babel.|$|E
5|$|As Coach begins putting {{together}} his new Lion team, he realizes he's in {{for more than}} he bargained for. The players who try out are less than desirable, but Coach gets a lucky break {{with a couple of}} new faces. The first is Vince Howard (Michael B. Jordan), a student who has gotten {{in trouble with the law}} too many times. He is given one last chance if he plays football for the East Dillon Lions. Although he has no prior football experience, he has natural talent and becomes the team's first star quarterback. The second break comes to the Lions when Buddy Garrity reveals to Eric that the address on file for the Panthers new prodigy running back, Luke Cafferty, <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than a mailbox in front of an empty lot, and Luke is really zoned for East Dillon. Tami is faced with a struggle as the principal of West Dillon. A new character on the show, Becky, is introduced when Tim Riggins rents a trailer on her mother's property. Although she is in love with Tim, she and Luke are both shopping at a convenience store and she allows Luke to drive her home. The two have sex and Becky becomes pregnant. Even though she is a student at East Dillon, she seeks out Tami's help with the situation. Tami discusses all of the options with her and Becky decides to get an abortion. Her mother goes with her to the procedure. Parents find out about this and led by Luke's mother, seek Mrs. Taylor's dismissal as principal. When Tami refuses to apologize, as she followed procedure, she is put on leave. She decides to return to her role as a guidance counselor, but at East Dillon.|$|E

25|$|Sri Lanka has one Martello tower, {{located at}} Hambantota {{on the south}} coast, which was {{restored}} in 1999. This tower {{may have been involved}} in repelling a French attack though there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than circumstantial support for the notion. British engineers commenced work on three towers to protect Trincomalee but never completed them.|$|E

The Addington cricket ground still exists, is still in use for local games and is held to be one of the oldest in England.|$|E

25|$|Although modern NY258 <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than {{a simple}} east–west {{connector}} between NY36 and NY63, it originally extended westward past NY36 to NY408 {{in the town of}} Mount Morris when it was first assigned in the early 1930s. By 1983, maintenance of all of NY258 west of NY36 had been transferred to Livingston County, leading to the truncation of the route to NY36 in the mid-1990s.|$|E
25|$|Unnayi Varyar, whose Nalacharitan Attakkatha {{is popular}} even today, {{was the most}} {{prominent}} poet of the 18th century among not only the Kathakali writers, but also among the classical poets of Kerala. He {{is often referred to}} as the Kalidasa of Kerala. Although Kathakali is a dance drama and its literary form should more or less be modeled after the drama, there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> in common between an Attakkatha and Sanskrit drama.|$|E
25|$|Thus, a Lisp list is not {{an atomic}} object, as an {{instance}} of a container class in C++ or Java would be. A list <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than an aggregate of linked conses. A variable which refers to a given list is simply a pointer to the first cons in the list. Traversal of a list {{can be done by}} cdring down the list; that is, taking successive cdrs to visit each cons of the list; or by using any of several higher-order functions to map a function over a list.|$|E

25|$|As a {{prescription}} <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than information among a prescriber, pharmacist and patient, information {{technology can be}} applied to it. Existing information technology is adequate to print out prescriptions. Medical information systems in some hospitals do away with prescriptions within the hospital. There are proposals to securely transmit the prescription from the prescriber to the pharmacist using smartcard or the internet. In the United Kingdom a project called the Electronic Transfer of Prescriptions (ETP) within the National Programme for IT (NPfIT) is currently piloting such a scheme between prescribers and pharmacies.|$|E
25|$|On 29 December Josipović gave {{a speech}} on an SDP {{convention}} held in Rijeka where he said that with the following presidential election the political map of Croatia would change forever and that by the next parliamentary election Croatia would be colored red, referring to his party's official colour being red. Bandić did not waste time {{and the next day}} attacked Josipović arguing that the next president should not be biased once again repeating his claim that Josipović <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than a pawn of Zoran Milanović who would work in his benefit if he should win. The prime minister Jadranka Kosor also criticized Josipović's remarks as unfitting.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{phenomena}} in quantum mechanics, such as quantum entanglement, might give the superficial impression of allowing {{communication of information}} faster than light. According to the no-communication theorem these phenomena do not allow true communication; they only let two observers in different locations see the same system simultaneously, without any way of controlling what either sees. Wavefunction collapse {{can be viewed as}} an epiphenomenon of quantum decoherence, which in turn <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than an effect of the underlying local time evolution of the wavefunction of a system and all of its environment. Since the underlying behaviour does not violate local causality or allow FTL it follows that neither does the additional effect of wavefunction collapse, whether real or apparent.|$|E

25|$|Modern mayflies have {{eliminated}} all the instars between imago and nymph, except the single instar called subimago, {{which is still}} not (at {{least not in the}} males) fully sexually mature. The other flying insects with incomplete metamorphosis (Exopterygota) have gone a little further and completed the trend; here all the immature structures of the animal from the last nymphal stage are completed at once in a single final moult. The more advanced insects with larvae and complete metamorphosis (Endopterygota) have gone even further. An interesting theory here is that the pupal stage is actually a strongly modified and extended stage of subimago, but so far it <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than a theory. Interestingly enough there are some insects within the Exopterygota, thrips and whiteflies (Aleyrodidae), who have evolved pupae-like stages too.|$|E
25|$|In {{his visits}} to Indianapolis, Wilson {{found that there}} was only one, unnamed African American {{represented}} in the city's many memorials and sculptures. The formerly enslaved African American figure appears {{at the base of the}} Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, a 284ft. 6 in. commemoration of the American Civil War, the American Revolution, the War of 1812, the Spanish–American War and the Mexican–American War. Some suggest that with the passage of time the commemorative nature of war memorials has been replaced with a more utilitarian purpose, such as city beautification. Consequently, the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument is said to symbolize both the city of Indianapolis and the state of Indiana. While others argue that there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> invisible than monuments, some art historians suggest that art can be utilized as a vehicle for racist ideology.|$|E
25|$|Within the novels, {{opponents of}} the Culture {{have argued that the}} role of humans in the Culture <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> than that of pets, or parasites on Culture Minds, and that they can have nothing {{genuinely}} useful to contribute to a society where science is close to omniscient about the physical universe, where every ailment has been cured, and where every thought can be read. Many of the Culture novels in fact contain characters (from within or without the Culture) wondering how far-reaching the Minds' dominance of the Culture is, and how much of the democratic process within it might in fact be a sham: subtly but very powerfully influenced by the Minds in much the same ways Contact and Special Circumstances influence other societies. Also, except for some mentions about a vote over the Idiran-Culture War, and the existence of {{a very small number of}} 'Referrers' (humans of especially acute reasoning), few biological entities are ever described as being involved in any high-level decisions.|$|E
