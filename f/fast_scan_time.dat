40|$|Abstract. Quality {{inspection}} plays a {{key role}} in the food industry. Besides metal detection finding small stones and glass splinters is of great importance. Furthermore, already established devices like conventional metal detectors offer only a low spatial resolution. In contrast to this method a rather novel technique is terahertz timedomain spectroscopy (THz TDS). The experimental set-up to simulate THz TDS consists of a standard free space THz spectrometer with photoconductive emitter and detector antennas driven by a femtosecond laser source. 2 D images are obtained by scanning the samples perpendicular to the THz beam. We show 2 D THz images that reveal contaminations like a metal screw, a small stone and a glass splitter with a spatial resolution of 1 mm. We go on to propose a measurement technique that allows for <b>faster</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>times</b> compared to the conventional technique. Since THz waves can penetrate different kinds of foods which are opaque in the visible spectrum, THz TDS promises to be a powerful tool in quality monitoring especially for the detection of non-metallic contaminations...|$|R

40|$|The major {{advantage}} of {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) over other imaging modalities like computed tomography (CT) {{is that it does}} not utilize ionizing radiation. A drawback of MRI in comparison to CT is that in general it requires longer <b>scan</b> <b>times</b> and for this reason <b>fast</b> <b>scanning</b> techniques have been proposed. Fast MR imaging can refer to <b>fast</b> <b>scan</b> <b>times</b> or <b>fast</b> signal acquisition. The first is important in various cases such as in abdominal scans to decrease motion sensitivity, while short echo times and short acquisition times allow visualization of tissues with fast signal relaxation. One category of MR sequences that allows <b>fast</b> <b>scanning</b> is gradient echo sequences. These sequences do not use radiofrequency pulses to yield a signal echo and this allows fast imaging, shorter echo <b>times</b> and <b>scan</b> <b>times,</b> while the signal decays according to the apparent transverse relaxation T_ 2 ^*. Gradient echo sequences can be used both for qualitative and quantitative imaging and during this thesis an application in each direction was explored. The first part of this thesis is related to fast gradient echo imaging for qualitative imaging of fast decaying signals. It is focused on the development of a short echo time sequence that can be easily translated to clinical settings. In the first chapter of this part a novel short echo time sequence is being introduced. Subsequently, two different applications are being discussed. Firstly, the application of the sequence to musculoskeletal imaging at high and ultra-high field is being described. In the second chapter, the effect of fat suppression on short T_ 2 tissues imaging is being considered. At the last chapter of this part the sequence is adapted to be used for molecular imaging of iron oxide labeled cells. The second part of this thesis refers to quantitative gradient echo imaging. The aim is tissue characterization based on the analysis of the signal decay. A multi-echo sequence is adapted in order to be used with a novel powerful fitting tool for three-dimensional (3 D) liver fat-water imaging.

Yet conventional CT devices pose limitations regarding specimen dimensions and material thicknesses. Here we introduce a novel CT system capable of inspecting very large objects (VLO) like automobiles or sea freight containers in 3 -D and discuss strategies for efficient scanning and reconstruction methods. The system utilizes a 9 MeV linear accelerator to achieve high penetration lengths in both dense and high-Z materials. The line detector array has an overall length of 4 meters.

40|$|A new trapped ion {{mobility}} spectrometry (TIMS) apparatus {{has been}} developed and evaluated. Building on the original prototype design, the new spectrometer includes an upstream "ion accumulation trap". Inclusion of the new trap allows for storage of a population of ions during the analysis of a previously stored population of ions. By accumulating and analyzing ions in parallel, rather than in series, a duty cycle of 100 % can be achieved. The new design retains {{the flexibility of the}} original design the ability to exchange mobility range, resolution, and speed/duty cycle while in all instances, maintaining superior ion utilization efficiency. When operating at 100 % duty cycle, the spectrometer is shown to trap a broad range of ions (m/z 622 - 2722) with an average trapping efficiency of similar to 70 %. Trapping efficiency was found to be constant over a range of accumulation/analysis times from 20 up to 85 ms where an average resolving power of 60 was achieved.

30|$|The {{radiologist}} has a {{wide array}} of imaging modalities to evaluate for bronchial disease. The initial study of choice in virtually all cases of bronchial disease is the chest standard frontal and lateral x-ray for its ease and convenience [2]. If further investigation is necessary, computed tomography (CT) is typically the next imaging modality of choice [3]. For these studies, contrast administration is often not necessary. Thin axial slices are recommended to allow for isotropic imaging and improved post-processing, including two-dimensional multiplanar reformatting, three-dimensional volume rendering, and virtual endoscopy, as these can be important diagnostic tools to better understand the anatomy of the bronchi and elucidate pathology [4]. Specialised imaging, such as high-resolution chest CT (HRCT), can be useful for assessment of conditions such as pulmonary fibrosis and bronchiectasis [5]. Occasionally, dynamic imaging is used to evaluate for conditions such as tracheobronchomalacia and Williams-Campbell syndrome when abnormalities may only be present during certain phases of the respiratory cycle [6]. Scanning children (especially those under 5  years of age) can be challenging because of an inability to follow technologist instructions, sometimes requiring sedation and intubation for scanning; however many of the newer multidetector CTs have <b>faster</b> <b>scan</b> <b>times</b> and can decrease or eliminate the need for sedation and/or intubation [7].|$|R

This numerical study explored the possibility of using a single mechanically rotating RF coil for RF shimming and specific absorption rate management applications at 7 T. In particular, this new approach (with three different RF coil element arrangements) was compared against both an 8 -channel parallel coil array and a birdcage volume coil, with and without RF current optimisation. The evaluation was conducted using an in-house developed and validated finite-difference time-domain method in conjunction with a tissue-equivalent human head model. It was found that, without current optimisation, the rotating RF coil method produced a more uniform flip angle distribution and a lower maximum global and local specific absorption rate compared to the 8 -channel parallel coil array and birdcage resonator. In addition, due to the large number of degrees of freedom in the form of rotated sensitivity profiles, the rotating RF coil approach exhibited good RF shimming and specific absorption rate management performance.

40|$|Echo-planar imaging with {{gradient}} echo allows whole-brain {{images to}} be rapidly acquired. However, its main limitation is that magnetic field inhomogeneities in {{regions of the}} brain close to bone and air-filled sinuses result in reduced signal-to-noise ratio and signal loss. In particular {{this is a problem}} for imaging the temporal lobes, and can therefore affect the results of some language-related studies. Decreasing the echo time (TE) increases the signal-to-noise ratio and reduces the amount of signal loss in susceptible regions. In this study we investigate the TE dependence of BOLD (blood oxygenation level-dependent) contrast and, in particular, how it is influenced in regions with susceptibility artifacts. We use a dual echo-time sequence to compare brain activations measured with two different TEs, TE � 40 ms and TE � 27 ms. The paradigm involves comparing famous faces to scrambled faces, a low-level control condition. It was chosen because famous faces have been repeatedly shown to activate the fusiform gyri and anterior temporal lobes in both PET and fMRI. Our results show {{that it is possible to}} detect robust activations at a lower TE in brain regions not affected by susceptibility artifacts (i. e., fusiform gyri), allowing for <b>faster</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>times.</b> However, although the amount of signal loss is reduced at the lower TE, this does not appear to be sufficient to recover the BOLD signal in regions affected by susceptibility artifacts (i. e., anterior temporal lobes). © 2002 Elsevier Scienc...|$|R

MethodsA retrospective review of consecutive coronary angiograms performed on a 64 -row multidetector CT from March to April 2007 (group 1 : 115 patients, 63 men; mean age [standard deviation] 59. 6 ± 12. 8 years) and on a 320 -row multidetector CT from March to April 2008 (group 2 : 169 patients, 89 men; mean [SD] age 57. 9 ± 11. 6 years). Two cardiac radiologists assessed the occurrence of respiratory artifact and coronary evaluability in studies with respiratory artifacts. Unevaluable coronary segments because of motion at the same anatomical level of the respiratory artifact were considered unevaluable because of this artifact. The association between the occurrence of respiratory artifact and patient biometrics, medication, and scan parameters was examined. ResultsRespiratory artifacts were detected in 9 of the 115 patients from group 1 (7. 8 %) and in none of the 169 patients from group 2 (P < . 001). Group 1 had longer <b>scan</b> <b>times</b> (median, 9. 3 seconds; range, 7. 5 − 14. 4 seconds) compared with group 2 (median, 1. 5 seconds; range, 1. 1 − 3. 5 seconds; P <. 001).

40|$|High {{performance}} scanning is {{a routine}} {{part of the}} digital photogrammetric production workflow. Modern scanners offer geometric precision similar to analytical plotters and high quality CCD sensors capable of faithfully capturing {{the information in the}} aerial photograph at 12 bits per channel to provide excellent dynamic range and tonal set-up. Modern practice is typically based on scanning positive or negative roll films. One of the critical requirements of the best scanners is high optical resolution at very high speed, motivated by the desire to complete roll-film scans overnight. Currently this can be done on the Leica DSW 600 Digital Scanning Workstation for black and white photography owing to its industry <b>fastest</b> <b>scan</b> <b>times</b> of 2 minutes per 23 x 23 cm frame.

Abstract—We present the first pipeline for real-time volumetric surface reconstruction and dense 6 DoF camera tracking running purely on standard, off-the-shelf mobile phones. Using only the embedded RGB camera, our system allows users to scan objects of varying shape, size, and appearance in seconds, with real-time feedback during the capture process. Unlike existing {{state of the art}} methods, which produce only point-based 3 D models on the phone, or require cloud-based processing, our hybrid GPU/CPU pipeline is unique in that it creates a connected 3 D surface model directly on the device at 25 Hz. In each frame, we perform dense 6 DoF tracking, which continuously registers the RGB input to the incrementally built 3 D model, minimizing a noise aware photoconsistency error metric. This is followed by efficient key-frame selection, and dense per-frame stereo matching. These depth maps are fused volumetrically using a method akin to KinectFusion, producing compelling surface models. For each frame, the implicit surface is extracted for live user feedback and pose estimation. We demonstrate scans of a variety of objects, and compare to a Kinect-based baseline, showing on average ∼ 1. 5 cm error.

30|$|Confocal laser {{scanning}} microscopy is used for intraoral scanner systems [28]. This technique is used to acquire in-focus images from selected depths, {{a process known as}} optical sectioning (high-resolution optical images with depth selectivity) [29]. The iTero scanner employs a parallel confocal imaging technique with an array of incident red laser beams [30]. It is important to maintain the scanning wand at a certain focal distance while scanning. The TRIOS intraoral system also works according to the principle of confocal microscopy, with a <b>fast</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>time.</b> A fundamental characteristic of the TRIOS system is the variation of the focal plane without moving the scanner toward the subject being scanned [30]. The TRIOS system has the feature of telecentricity in the space of the subject being scanned, and it is possible to shift the focal plane while keeping telecentricity and magnification ratio [30]. We evaluated the light wave of the iTero and TRIOS scanners using polarization beam splitter and quarter-wave plate (Thorlabs Inc., Newton, NJ). It was found that the light of the TRIOS scanner was polarized, whereas the light of the iTero scanner was not polarized. The TRIOS scanner was found to use linear-to-circular polarization by the quarter-wave plate. A wave plate is an optical device that alters the polarization state of a light wave traveling through it. Two common types of wave plates are the half-wave plate, which shifts the polarization direction of linearly polarized light, and the quarter-wave plate, which converts linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light and vice versa [31]. In consideration of the polarization system of the TRIOS scanner, which might block the scattered reflections, this scanner might have better optical performance than iTero.|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT) offers significant {{potential as a}} metrological tool, given the wealth of internal and external data that can be captured, much of which is inaccessible to conventional optical and tactile coordinate measurement machines (CMM). Typical lab-based CT can take upwards of 30 [*]min to produce a 3 D model of an object, making it unsuitable for volume production inspection applications. Recently {{a new generation of}} real time tomography (RTT) x-ray CT has been developed for airport baggage inspections, utilising novel electronically switched x-ray sources instead of a rotating gantry. This enables bags to be scanned in a few seconds and 3 D volume images produced in almost real time for qualitative assessment to identify potential threats. Such systems are able to scan objects as large as 600 [*]mm in diameter at 500 [*]mm s− 1. The current voxel size of such a system is approximately 1 mm—much larger than lab-based CT, but with significantly <b>faster</b> <b>scan</b> <b>times</b> is an attractive prospect to explore. This paper will examine the potential of such systems for real time metrological inspection of additively manufactured parts. The measurement accuracy of the Rapiscan RTT 110, an RTT airport baggage scanner, is evaluated by comparison to measurements from a metrologically confirmed CMM and those achieved by conventional lab-CT. It was found to produce an average absolute error of 0. 18 [*]mm that may already have some applications in the manufacturing line. While this is expectedly a greater error than lab-based CT, a number of adjustments are suggested that could improve resolution, making the technology viable for a broader range of in-line quality inspection applications, including cast and additively manufactured parts...|$|R

Two cervical spine specimens with artificial trauma were scanned with a SS-CT scanner (HighSpeed, CT/i, GE, Milwaukee, Wis.) by using various collimations (1, 3, 5 mm) and pitch factors (1, 1. 5, 2, 3) and a four-slice helical CT scanner (LightSpeed, QX/i, GE, Milwaukee, Wis.) by using various table speeds ranging from 3. 75 to 15 mm/rotation for a pitch of 0. 75 and from 7. 5 to 30 mm/rotation for a pitch of 1. 5. Images were reconstructed with an interval of 1 mm. Sagittal and coronal multiplanar reconstructions of the primary and reconstructed data set were performed. For MS-CT a tube current resulting in equivalent image noise as with SS-CT was used. All images were judged by two observers using a 4 -point scale. The best image quality for SS-CT was achieved with the smallest slice thickness (1 mm) and a pitch smaller than 2 resulting in a table speed of up to 2 mm per gantry rotation (4 points). A reduction of the slice thickness rather than of the table speed proved to be beneficial at MS-CT. Therefore, the optimal scan protocol in MS-CT included a slice thickness of 1. 25 mm with a table speed of 7. 5 mm/ 360 degrees using a pitch of 1. 5 (4 points), resulting in a <b>faster</b> <b>scan</b> <b>time</b> than when a pitch of 0. 75 (4 points) was used.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the quality and accuracy of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) gated by active breathing control (ABC), which may be useful for image guidance in the presence of respiration. Comparisons were made between conventional ABC-CBCT (stop and go), fast ABC-CBCT (a method to speed up the acquisition by slowing the gantry instead of stopping during free breathing), and free breathing respiration correlated CBCT. Image quality was assessed in phantom. Accuracy of reconstructed voxel intensity, uniformity, and root mean square error were evaluated. Registration accuracy (bony and soft tissue) was quantified with both an anthropomorphic and a quality assurance phantom. Gantry angle accuracy was measured with respect to gantry speed modulation. Conventional ABC-CBCT <b>scan</b> <b>time</b> ranged from 2. 3 to 5. 8 min. <b>Fast</b> ABC-CBCT <b>scan</b> <b>time</b> ranged from 1. 4 to 1. 8 min, and respiratory correlated CBCT scans took 2. 1 min to complete.

40|$|Positron-Emission-Tomography (PET) is {{a modern}} imaging {{technique}} in nuclear medicine providing quantitative 3 D distribution of a radioactive tracer substance in the human body. The gamma-detector is the first link {{in the chain of}} components that constitutes a PET. It converts incoming radiation into optical light pulses, which are detected by photo multiplier tubes. Here the light is converted into electric pulses, to be further processed by the acquisition electronics. Improving detector sensitivity and resolution is of great value in research and in clinical practice. The focus of this work is to improve the detector to give it time-of-flight (TOF) capabilities, in order to further improve sensitivity, which in turn leads to increased image quality, <b>faster</b> <b>scan</b> <b>time</b> and/or reduced dose exposure for the patient. Image quality has improved over the years, but losses in image quality have been reported for heavy patients, due to increased attenuation, and more dispersed counts over a larger volume. Instrumentation limits are still significant in heavy patient images, but the incorporation of TOF information promises to alleviate some of the limitations. In order to improve the timing resolution of the detector fast photo-multipliers and a novel scheme to extract the event timing trigger from a detector by using the summed dynode signal were investigated. When designing new PET detectors, {{it is important to have}} detailed understanding and control of the light sharing mechanisms in the crystal arrays. Therefore it was necessary to perform optical simulations and single crystal light output measurements to derive a model for an LSO block detector. Another way to improve the image quality is to use the depth-of-interaction (DOI) of the gamma ray within the detector. It is shown that a multi-layer phoswich detector comprised of LSO with different decay times and TOF capability, combines the benefits of TOF and DOI in one detector, maximizing the effective sensitivity gain. At the time of the doctoral defense, the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 7 : Submitted...|$|R
40|$|The {{utility of}} HR-CT to study {{longitudinal}} changes in bone microarchitecture {{is limited by}} subject radiation exposure. Although MR {{is not subject to}} this limitation, it is limited both by patient movement that occurs during prolonged scanning at distal sites, and by the signal-to-noise ratio that is achievable for high-resolution images in a reasonable <b>scan</b> <b>time</b> at proximal sites. Recently, a novel MR-based technique, fine structure analysis (FSA) (Chase et al. Localised one-dimensional magnetic resonance spatial frequency spectroscopy. PCT/US 2012 / 068284 2012, James and Chase Magnetic field gradient structure characteristic assessment using one-dimensional (1 D) spatial frequency distribution analysis. 7932720 B 2, 2011) has been developed which provides both high-resolution and <b>fast</b> <b>scan</b> <b>times,</b> but which generates at a designated set of spatial positions (voxels) a one-dimensional signal of spatial frequencies. Appendix 1 provides a brief introduction to FSA. This article describes an initial exploration of FSA for the rapid, non-invasive characterization of trabecular microarchitecture in a preclinical setting. For L 4 vertebrae of sham and ovariectomized (OVX) rats, we compared FSA-generated metrics with those from CT datasets and from CT-derived histomorphometry parameters, trabecular number (Tb. N), bone volume density (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb. Th) and trabecular separation (Tb. Sp). OVX caused a reduction of the higher frequency structures that correspond to a denser trabecular lattice, while increasing the preponderance of lower frequency structures, which correspond to a more open lattice. As one example measure, the centroid of the FSA spectrum (which we refer to as fSAcB) showed strong correlation in the same region with CT-derived histomorphometry values: Tb. Sp: r − 0. 63, p < 0. 001; Tb. N: r 0. 71, p < 0. 001; BV/TV: r 0. 64, p < 0. 001, Tb. Th: r 0. 44, p < 0. 05. Furthermore, we found a 17. 5 % reduction in fSAcB in OVX rats (p < 0. 0001). In a longitudinal study, FSA showed that the age-related increase in higher frequency structures was abolished in OVX rats, being replaced with a 78 – 194 % increase in lower frequency structures (2. 4 – 2. 8 objects/mm range), indicating a more sparse trabecular lattice (p < 0. 05). The MR-based fine structure analysis enables high-resolution, radiation-free, rapid quantification of bone structures in one dimension (the specific point and direction being chosen by the clinician) of the spine...|$|R

40|$|Background: One of {{the major}} uses of cone beam {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) is presurgical implant planning. Linear measurement {{is used for the}} determination of the quantity of alveolar bone (height and width). Linear measurements are used in orthodontic analysis and definition of jaw tumor size. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the accuracy of the linear measurement of CBCT (Newtom VG) in the axial and coronal planes, with two different voxel sizes. Materials and Methods: In this accuracy diagnostic study, 22 anatomic landmarks in four dry human skulls were marked by gutta-percha. Fifteen linear measurements were obtained using a digital caliper. These were considered to be the gold standard (real measurement). The skulls were scanned by CBCT (Newtom VG) at two settings: (a) Voxel size 0. 3 mm (b) voxel size 0. 15 mm High Resolution (HR). The radiographic distance measurements were made in the axial and coronal sections by three observers. The radiographic measurements were repeated two weeks later for evaluation of intraobserver reliability. SPSS software version 17 was used for data analysis. The level of significance was considered to be 5 % (P ≤ 0. 05). Results: The mean differences of real and radiographic measurements were - 0. 10 ± 0. 99 mm in the axial sections, - 0. 27 ± 1. 07 mm in the coronal sections, + 0. 14 ± 1. 44 mm in the axial (HR) sections, and 0. 02 ± 1. 4 mm in the coronal (HR) sections. The intraclass correlation (ICC) for CBCT measurements in the axial sections was 0. 9944, coronal sections 0. 9941, axial (HR) sections 0. 9935, and coronal (HR) sections 0. 9937. The statistical analysis showed high interobserver and intraobserver reliability (P ≤ 0. 05). Conclusion: CBCT (Newtom VG) is highly accurate and reproducible in linear measurements in the axial and coronal image planes and in different areas of the maxillofacial region. According to the findings of the present study, a CBCT scan with a larger voxel size (0. 3 mm in comparison to 0. 15 mm) is recommended when the purpose of the CBCT scan is to measure linear distances. This will result in lower patient radiation dose and <b>faster</b> <b>scan</b> <b>time...</b>|$|R
