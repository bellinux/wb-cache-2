5|$|As a three-year-old, Soyer was {{diagnosed}} with leukaemia, and doctors were pessimistic about <b>his</b> <b>chances</b> for survival. Despite being declared cancer free {{by the age of}} six, the cancer came back when he was eight years old. As a child, he played Australian rules football and was a member of Little Athletics. He attended Benalla College.|$|E
5|$|As his {{four-year}} term as executive neared its end, Agnew knew that <b>his</b> <b>chances</b> of re-election were slim, {{given that the}} county's Democrats had healed their rift. Instead, in 1966 he sought the Republican nomination for governor, and {{with the backing of}} party leaders won the April primary by a wide margin.|$|E
5|$|Australia has {{competed in}} alpine skiing at every Olympics since 1952. Australia's first female skier, Christine Davy, competed in 1956. Malcolm Milne was {{considered}} a possible medalalist at the 1972 Olympics, having finished on the podium at the world championships, but a knee injury and a near fall snuffed out <b>his</b> <b>chances.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following {{his defeat}} in the Senate, Stanley {{returned}} to his legal practice. In the 1927 gubernatorial election, he threw his support to his old enemy, J. C. W. Beckham, hoping to improve <b>his</b> <b>chances</b> of returning to the Senate in 1930. Beckham lost to Republican Flem D. Sampson, greatly diminishing Stanley's chances in the senatorial campaign.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>chances</b> {{of obtaining}} a licence were put into further {{jeopardy}} because he had collected eight recorded misdemeanours with the police during his youth. In 1960, he received his first car, an old Volkswagen Beetle. His interest in motorsport greatly increased when he visited the 1961 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring with school friends, including fellow future Formula One driver Helmut Marko.|$|E

5|$|Commentators noted McCotter's lack of name {{recognition}} hindered <b>his</b> <b>chances</b> for nomination. When included in Republican presidential preference polls, he regularly received {{less than one}} percent support. Following a last place finish in the Ames Straw Poll and the lack of any invitation to presidential debates, he dropped his candidacy on September 22, 2011, and endorsed Mitt Romney. Thereafter, McCotter reportedly wrote a television pilot, which was released to the media prior to his resignation from Congress in July 2012 amid a fraud investigation surrounding his congressional re-election campaign.|$|E
5|$|In {{between some}} odd jobs, Vandersteen became an avid sporter, from {{gymnastics}} over cycling to wrestling. <b>His</b> <b>chances</b> improved in 1936 {{when he was}} hired as a decorator for the shop and the display windows of L'Innovation, a Belgian chain of supermarkets. In the same year, he met Paula Van Den Branden, whom he married on 9 October 1937. After living in Antwerp for two years and having a daughter, Helena, in 1938, the first of their four children, the couple moved to the more rural Schilde in 1939.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Jones faced Republican Larry Hopkins, a seven-term congressman {{representing}} Kentucky's 6th congressional district. Hopkins {{was considered the}} Republicans' best hope of capturing the governorship since Louie B. Nunn in 1967. Instead, Hopkins' negative campaign ads, mistakes about his record, and involvement in a House scandal involving bounced checks all hurt <b>his</b> <b>chances.</b> Jones won the election {{by a vote of}} 540,468 to 294,542, the largest margin of victory in a Kentucky gubernatorial race.|$|E

5|$|On December 12, 2006, in {{an attempt}} to boost <b>his</b> <b>chances</b> of playing in the NBA, McNamara signed with the Bakersfield Jam, an NBA Development League team located in Bakersfield, California. In doing so, he gave up a {{significant}} amount of money by leaving Olympiakos. McNamara was named as a reserve to the Western Conference's All-Star team and played in the Gillette D-League All-Star Game on February 17, 2007, in Las Vegas. He scored two points and recorded 5 assists. He finished the 2006–2007 season averaging 10.8 points and 5.2 assists in 41 games.|$|E
5|$|Pierce fully {{expected}} to be renominated by the Democrats. In reality <b>his</b> <b>chances</b> of winning the nomination were slim, let alone re-election. The administration was widely disliked in the North for its position on the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and Democratic leaders were aware of Pierce's electoral vulnerability. Nevertheless, his supporters began to plan for an alliance with Douglas to deny James Buchanan the nomination. Buchanan had solid political connections and had been safely overseas through most of Pierce's term, leaving him untainted by the Kansas debacle.|$|E
5|$|Tydings {{resumed his}} legal career after {{he lost his}} Senate seat, {{entering}} into practice with a Washington law firm that included Giant Food President Joseph Danzansky. After several years out of politics, he began traveling the state in 1975 to gauge <b>his</b> <b>chances</b> for winning a rematch versus Beall, who was coming up for re-election in 1976. On January 10, 1976, Tydings announced his candidacy to retake the seat, which he argued was taken unfairly in 1970 due to an undisclosed $180,000 gift to the Beall campaign.|$|E

5|$|When the two entered Roubaix, Wegmuller {{ran over}} {{a plastic bag}} that flew {{out in front of}} him, which became jammed in his derailleur. Wegmuller was unable to change gears which was crucial for a sprint finish. He got {{assistance}} from his team car to remove the bag, but his gears still would not change. Knowing that a bicycle change would be suicidal to <b>his</b> <b>chances,</b> Wegmuller continued on his damaged bike; Demol continued to draft behind him.|$|E
5|$|A Warrior Who Fought Custer was {{published}} in April 1931 to mostly good reviews. However, W. J. Ghent, writing in the New York Times, criticized the claim made by Wooden Leg that many of Custer's men had committed suicide rather than face death {{at the hands of}} the Indians. Although sales of the Wooden Leg book did well, better than Marquis had expected, this controversy was to prove a hindrance to <b>his</b> <b>chances</b> of future book publications. Marquis believed he had multiple Indian sources verifying this account, and there were no surviving whites to contradict it. He planned to develop the idea more fully in a future book, eventually to become Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself.|$|E
5|$|After the US Open, del Potro {{played in}} the Davis Cup {{semifinal}} against Serbia, winning both of his rubbers against Janko Tipsarević and world No. 1 Novak Djokovic. This helped Argentina to a 3–2 victory over Serbia in the semifinals, booking {{their place in the}} final. He then {{played in the}} Stockholm Open, losing in the second round to James Blake. He then reached the final in Vienna, losing {{for the first time to}} Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Despite having won the first set, he eventually lost the final. Del Potro then reached the semifinals of the Valencia Open 500, losing to eventual champion Marcel Granollers. He then withdrew from the Paris Masters due to a shoulder injury, wiping out <b>his</b> <b>chances</b> of qualifying for the Year-End Championships.|$|E

5|$|After {{the breakup}} with Esperanza, Martín resumes his romance with Constanza and {{eventually}} proposes marriage to her, {{in order to}} improve <b>his</b> <b>chances</b> of winning custody of the three siblings. The judge, who thought that Esperanza was a bad influence on the children, gives the adoption to Constanza instead of Martín, forcing him to marry her. Their marriage proves difficult; Constanza is demanding and possessive, and despises the adopted siblings, who hate her as well. Martín finally breaks with Constanza when she pretends to be blind to keep him with her. The children's custody battle delays the divorce, as Martín wants to keep them.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was unusual}} at {{the time for a}} {{national}} candidate to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He also sought to boost <b>his</b> <b>chances</b> in Tennessee while re-establishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive, in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy. The Democratic candidate for president, George McClellan, hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.|$|E
5|$|Banks was {{determined}} to break the siege by a direct assault on the Confederate lines. Dow believed the attack to be a mistake, and delayed his units' participation until later in the day. In the assault, which was unsuccessful, Dow {{was wounded in the}} right arm and left thigh and sent to a nearby plantation to convalesce. While in the hospital, he lobbied for a transfer to a theater where <b>his</b> <b>chances</b> of promotion would be greater. On June 30, having healed enough to mount a horse again, Dow visited his troops. As he returned to the hospital after dark, he was captured by Confederate cavalry operating behind Union lines.|$|E
