40|$|In {{this study}} the {{technique}} <b>Differential</b> Optical <b>Absorption</b> Spectroscopy (DOAS) has been adapted for the retrieval of the absorption and biomass {{of two major}} phytoplankton groups (PhytoDOAS) from data of the satellite sensor Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY). SCIAMACHY measures back scattered solar radiation in the UV-Vis-NIR spectral region with a high spectral resolution (0. 2 to 1. 5 nm). In order to identify phytoplankton absorption characteristics in SCIAMACHY data {{in the range of}} 430 to 500 nm, phytoplankton absorption spectra measured in-situ during two different RV "Polarstern" expeditions were used. The two spectra have been measured in different ocean regions where different phytoplankton groups (cyanobacteria and diatoms) dominated the phytoplankton composition. Results show clearly different absorption characteristics of the phytoplankton groups in the SCIAMACHY spectra. Globally distributed pigment concentrations for these characteristic phytoplankton groups for two monthly periods (FebruaryMarch 2004 and OctoberNovember 2005) were derived from these <b>differential</b> <b>absorptions</b> by including the information of the sensor's optical paths within the water column (i. e. light penetration depth) according to Vountas et al. (2007) derived from DOAS fits of inelastic scattering. The satellite retrieved information on cyanobacteria and diatoms distribution matches well the concentrations measured at collocated water samples with HPLC technique and concentrations derived from the global model analysis with the NOBM model (Gregg et al., 2003; Gregg and Casey, 2007). Identifying quantitative distribution of key phytoplankton groups from space allow to distinguish various biogeochemical provinces and will be of great importance for the global modelling of marine ecosystem and biogeochemical cycles addressing climate changes in the oceanic biosphere...|$|R
50|$|Although {{there is}} much overlap in the {{requirements}} and use of instruments, ordinary CD instruments are usually optimized for operation in the ultraviolet, approximately 170-300 nm, while MCD instruments are typically required {{to operate in the}} visible to near infrared, approximately 300-2000 nm. The physical processes that lead to MCD are substantively different from those of CD. However, like CD, it is dependent on the <b>differential</b> <b>absorption</b> of left and right hand circularly polarized light. MCD will only exist at a given wavelength if the studied sample has an optical absorption at that wavelength. This is distinctly different from the related phenomenon of optical rotatory dispersion (ORD), which can be observed at wavelengths far from any absorption band.|$|E
50|$|Measurement of CD is also {{complicated}} by the fact that typical aqueous buffer systems often absorb in the range where structural features exhibit <b>differential</b> <b>absorption</b> of circularly polarized light. Phosphate, sulfate, carbonate, and acetate buffers are generally incompatible with CD unless made extremely dilute e.g. in the 10-50 mM range. The TRIS buffer system should be completely avoided when performing far-UV CD. Borate and Onium compounds are often used to establish the appropriate pH range for CD experiments. Some experimenters have substituted fluoride for chloride ion because fluoride absorbs less in the far UV, and some have worked in pure water. Another, almost universal, technique is to minimize solvent absorption by using shorter path length cells when working in the far UV, 0.1 mm path lengths are not uncommon in this work.|$|E
50|$|Lidar {{systems can}} be used to measure {{concentration}} profiles of atmospheric gases (i.e., water vapor, ozone), and industrial emissions (i.e., SO2, NO2, HCl). Such measurements are performed using two basic types of lidar; Raman lidar and <b>Differential</b> <b>Absorption</b> lidars (DIAL). In the first type, the Raman lidar detects the scattering of the laser beam due to Raman scattering. The frequency shift induced by such scattering is unique for each molecule, and acts as a “signature” to detect its specific contribution. The second type, DIAL systems, emit two beams with two distinct frequencies. One beam is tuned exactly on a molecular absorption line and the other beam is tuned in a nearby wavelength without molecular absorption. By examining the intensity difference of the scattered light at the two frequencies, DIAL systems can separate the contribution of the specific molecule in the atmosphere.|$|E

Global satellite data on photosynthetically active radiation and chl a concentration are available from a suite of satellite imagers like CZCS, SeaWiFS, MODIS, MERIS and others, but spectral information of absorption by phytoplankton and other water constituents is still lacking. Therefore, we used <b>Differential</b> Optical <b>Absorption</b> Spectroscopy (DOAS) to study the retrieval of phytoplankton distribution and absorption with the satellite sensor Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY). SCIAMACHY measures back scattered solar radiation in the UV-Vis-NIR spectral region with a high spectral resolution (0. 2 to 1. 5 nm). We used in-situ measured phytoplankton absorption spectra from two different RV Polarstern expeditions where different phytoplankton groups were representing or dominating the phytoplankton composition {{in order to identify}} these characteristic absorption spectra in SCIAMACHY data in the range of 430 to 500 nm.
