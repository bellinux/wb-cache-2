40|$|We {{used the}} {{recently}} developed commercially available <b>Delta</b> <b>Ray</b> isotope ratio infrared spectrometer (IRIS) to continuously measure the CO 2 concentration c and its isotopic composition δ 13 C and δ 18 O in a managed beech forest in central Germany. Our objectives are (a)  to characterize the <b>Delta</b> <b>Ray</b> IRIS and evaluate its internal calibration procedure and (b)  to quantify the seasonal variability of c, δ 13 C, δ 18 O and the isotopic composition of nighttime net ecosystem CO 2 exchange (respiration) R eco 13 C and R eco 18 O derived from Keeling plot intercepts. The analyzer's minimal Allan deviation (as {{a measure of}} precision) was below 0. 01  ppm for the CO 2 concentration and below 0. 03  ‰ for both δ values. The potential accuracy (defined as the 1 σ deviation from the respective linear regression that was used for calibration) was approximately 0. 45  ppm for c, 0. 24  ‰ for 13 C and 0. 3  ‰ for 18 O. For repeated measurements of a target gas in the field, the long-term standard deviation from the mean was 0. 3  ppm for c and below 0. 3  ‰ for both δ values. We used measurements of nine different inlet heights to evaluate the isotopic compositions of nighttime net ecosystem CO 2 exchange R eco 13 C and R eco 18 O in a 3 -month measurement campaign in a beech forest in autumn 2015. During this period, an early snow and frost event occurred, coinciding with {{a change in the}} observed characteristics of both R eco 13 C and R eco 18 O. Before the first snow, R eco 13 C correlated significantly (p  [*][*]  0. 1) for the period after the first snow, indicating a decoupling of δ 13 C of respiration from recent assimilates. For 18 O, we measured a decrease of 30  ‰ within 10  days in R eco 18 O after the snow event, potentially reflecting the influence of 18 O depleted snow on soil moisture. This decrease was 10  times larger than the corresponding decrease in δ 18 O in ambient CO 2 (below 3  ‰) and took 3  times longer to recover (3  weeks vs. 1  week). In summary, we conclude that (1)  the new <b>Delta</b> <b>Ray</b> IRIS with its internal calibration procedure provides an opportunity to precisely and accurately measure c, δ 13 C and δ 18 O at field sites and (2)  even short snow or frost events might have strong effects on the isotopic composition (in particular 18 O) of CO 2 exchange on an ecosystem scale...|$|R

The transport calculation accounting for the shuttle configuration is accomplished by using a new version of HZETRN that has been extensively verified with laboratory and flight data. The agreement of predicted and measured lineal energy spectra is within 70 % for the region above 2 keV/micrometer but within a factor of 2. 3 underpredicted for the region below this value. The inclusion of indirect <b>delta</b> <b>ray</b> events in the model is needed before possible causes for the underprediction below 2 keV/micrometer can be assessed...|$|R
50|$|Electrons {{produced}} in nuclear decay are called beta particles. Because of their low mass relative to atoms, they are strongly scattered by nuclei (Coulomb or Rutherford scattering), {{much more so}} than heavier particles. Beta particle tracks are therefore crooked. In addition to producing secondary electrons (<b>delta</b> <b>rays)</b> while ionizing atoms, they also produce bremsstrahlung photons. A maximum range of beta radiation can be defined experimentally which is smaller than the range that would be measured along the particle path.|$|E
50|$|A delta ray is {{characterized}} by very fast electrons produced in quantity by alpha particles or other fast energetic charged particles knocking orbiting electrons out of atoms.

The number of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are produced by radiation varies little with radiation type: however, for high-LET radiation, a higher fraction of DNA damages are complex; i.e., clusters containing mixtures of two or more of the various types of damages (SSB, DSB, etc.) within a localized region of DNA. Complex damage is uncommon for endogenous damage or low-LET radiation, and has been associated with the increased RBE of densely ionizing radiation. The repair of DSB is known to occur through direct end-joining and homologous recombination processes. Indications are that: ...|$|E

These included pre- and post-war spells in England, where she worked with the pioneer radiobiologist, Douglas Lea. Over ten years from 1937, Tikvah retrained and then also worked as a teacher of the deaf.

40|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} to estimate the number of particle-track traversals per cell or cell nucleus {{as the product of}} the ion's linear energy transfer (LET) and cell area.

The physics analysis potential of CMS depends on the accuracy of the simulation of such a complex device. The fast shaping times of the electronics and the signal degradation due to the radiation damage caused by the large flux of particles produced in the LHC collisions are a challenge for the simulation. The accuracy of the predicted space point resolution depends on the ability to correctly model several factors: the diffusion of charges in the 4 T magnetic field of CMS, the <b>delta</b> <b>ray</b> emission, the inter-strip capacitance, the collected charge and the noise.

40|$|Patient’s {{treatment}} plan verification covers {{substantial amount of}} the quality assurance (QA) resources, {{this is especially true}} for Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy (IMPT). The use of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in supporting QA has been widely discussed and several methods have been proposed. In this paper we studied an alternative approach from the one being currently applied clinically at Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica (CNAO). We reanalysed the previously published data (Molinelli et al. 2013), where 9 patient plans were investigated in which the warning QA threshold of 3 % mean dose deviation was crossed. The possibility that these differences between measurement and calculated dose were related to dose modelling (Treatment Planning Systems (TPS) vs MC), limitations on dose delivery system or detectors mispositioning was originally explored but other factors such as the geometric description of the detectors were not ruled out. For the purpose of this work we compared ionisation-chambers measurements with different MC simulations results. It was also studied some physical effects introduced by this new approach for example inter detector interference and the <b>delta</b> <b>ray</b> thresholds. The simulations accounting for a detailed geometry typically are superior (statistical difference - p-value around 0. 01) to most of the MC simulations used at CNAO (only inferior to the shift approach used). No real improvement were observed in reducing the current delta-ray threshold used (100 keV) and no significant interference between ion chambers in the phantom were detected (p-value 0. 81). In conclusion, it was observed that the detailed geometrical description improves the agreement between measurement and MC calculations in some cases. But in other cases position uncertainty represents the dominant uncertainty. The inter chamber disturbance was not detected for the therapeutic protons energies and the results from the current delta threshold are acceptable for MC simulations in IMPT...|$|R

In the case of FT-IR a novel methodology using only two standards of CO 2 in air with different mole fractions but identical isotopic composition was demonstrated to be highly accurate for measurements of δ 13 C and δ 18 O with standard uncertainties of 0. 09 ‰ and 1. 03 ‰, respectively, at a nominal CO 2 mole fraction of 400 μmol mol- 1 in air. In the case of the IRIS system, we demonstrate that the use of two standards of CO 2 in air of known but differing δ 13 C and δ 18 O isotopic composition allows standard uncertainties of 0. 18 ‰ and 0. 48 ‰ to be achieved for δ 13 C and δ 18 O measurements, respectively. The calibration strategies were validated using a set of five traceable primary reference gas mixtures. These standards, produced with whole air or synthetic air covered the mole fraction range of (378 - 420) μmol mol- 1 and were prepared and/or value assigned either by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or the National Physical Laboratory (NPL).
