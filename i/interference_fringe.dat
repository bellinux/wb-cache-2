50|$|An optical flat {{is usually}} placed upon {{a flat surface}} to be tested. If the surface is clean and {{reflective}} enough, rainbow colored bands of <b>interference</b> <b>fringes</b> will form when the test piece is illuminated with white light. However, if a monochromatic light is used to illuminate the work piece, such as helium, low-pressure sodium, or a laser, then a series of dark and light <b>interference</b> <b>fringes</b> will form. These <b>interference</b> <b>fringes</b> determine the flatness of the work piece, relative to the optical flat, to within {{a fraction of the}} wavelength of the light. If both surfaces are perfectly the same flatness and parallel to each other, no <b>interference</b> <b>fringes</b> will form. However, there is usually some air trapped between the surfaces. If the surfaces are flat, but a tiny optical wedge of air exists between them, then straight, parallel <b>interference</b> <b>fringes</b> will form, indicating the angle of the wedge (i.e.: more, thinner fringes indicate a steeper wedge while fewer but wider fringes indicate less of a wedge). The shape of the fringes also indicate the shape of the test surface, because fringes with a bend, a contour, or rings indicate high and low points on the surface, such as rounded edges, hills or valleys, or convex and concave surfaces.|$|R

Applying this method to experimental data, we succeeded in numerically reproducing a two-photon <b>interference</b> <b>fringe</b> using the experimentally obtained density matrix, in which almost no free fitting parameters are required. From the results, because {{the main cause of}} the degradation of an <b>interference</b> <b>fringe</b> was found to be the limited aperture size of a two-photon detector, we can observe a two-photon <b>interference</b> <b>fringe</b> with a visibility of up to 94 % in the experiments if an efficient two-photon absorbing material or a two-photon detector with a sufficiently high spatial resolution can be used...|$|E
