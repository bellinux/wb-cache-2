5000|$|SABA {{launched}} several products {{designed by}} Philippe Starck, {{the director of}} consumer electronics at Thomson. These included: [...] "Jim Nature" [...] (1994), a portable TV set made of recycled <b>high-density</b> <b>wood,</b> now exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, and [...] "Oye-Oye", a small radio with an innovative form factor.|$|E
50|$|The {{extensive}} renovations included {{making the}} building LEED Silver certified. To achieve {{this level of}} certification, extensive amounts of reclaimed building materials were used, all removed materials were repurposed, and a geothermal heat pump installed to help heat and cool the building. Because air conditioning systems were needed for each building tenant, multiple rooftop air conditioning units were required. To meet LEED Silver standards, 28476 sq ft of modified bitumen membrane and 8500 sq ft of EPDM rubber {{were removed from the}} roof and replaced with 0.5 in <b>high-density</b> <b>wood</b> panels with a high R-value. On top of this were 3 in of soy polyurethane foam; a base, intermediate, and top coat of silicone coating (each 0.001 in thick); and a silicone sealant. The high R-value of the roof allowed significant downsizing of the air conditioning and other HVAC equipment.|$|E
40|$|<b>High-density</b> <b>wood</b> is {{required}} in wood flooring, especially in engineered wood flooring (EWF) designed for heavy-duty applications. However, <b>high-density</b> <b>wood</b> resources are limited and their cost is high. A densification treatment {{makes it possible for}} low- or moderate-density woods to replace harder species by modifying them into high-performance and high-value products, such as engineered wood flooring for heavy-duty applications. The general objective {{of this study was to}} develop a prototype of engineered wood flooring using sugar maple hygro-thermally densified surface layers. The results showed that thin sugar maple lumber densified at 200 Â°C under the combined effects of steam, heat, and pressure with a heat-resistant fabric had great potential for the manufacturing of engineered wood flooring for heavy-duty use. As a result of treatment, it acquired high density, improved mechanical properties, and it had a relatively high dimensional stability and an attractive color. Tests in conditioning rooms showed that the EWF with a densified sugar maple (Acer saccharum March.) surface layer presented the lowest amplitude distortion between the dry and humid conditions compared with the standard EWF (0. 15 mm vs. 0. 17 mm and 0. 25 mm) ...|$|E
40|$|Grain raising, {{the lifting}} of fibres when water is applied to wood surfaces, is a reason why some {{companies}} are reluctant to finish wood products with water-borne coatings. However, the elements that lift-up and cause grain raising have not been identified, {{and the relationship between}} wood density and grain raising has not been clarified. Our work sought answers to both questions. We planed or sanded different woods using aluminum oxide abrasive paper, and characterized surfaces using profilometry and SEM. Surfaces were re-characterized after wetting and drying. Grain raising is inversely related to wood density. In particular, very low-density woods are highly susceptible to grain raising, whereas grain raising does not occur in <b>high-density</b> <b>woods</b> or planed woods. In low-density woods, sanding tears cell walls creating loosely-bonded slivers of wood that project from surfaces, particularly after wetting and drying. This mechanism for grain raising was confirmed by modelling the action of abrasives on wood cell walls using an array of hollow tubes and a serrated tool. Less commonly, fibres and fibre-bundles project from surfaces. We observed that grain raising was correlated with the coarseness of the abrasive and conclude that it can be reduced in severity by tailoring sanding to account for the density and surface microstructure of wood...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{modifications}} of Scots pine (Pinus slyvestris) wood flour were performed with vinyl acetate (VA) and acetic anhydride (AA) {{in the presence}} of potassium carbonate as a catalyst. Scots pine wood flour samples were successfully acetylated with VA (19 wt% gain) and AA (24 wt% gain). The effect of chemical modification of the Scots pine wood flour with AA and VA on the mechanical properties of <b>wood</b> <b>high-density</b> polyethylene composites (WPC) were determined. It was observed that acetylation of wood flour allowed a significant increase in both the mechanical properties and the thermal stability of the WPCs. It was concluded that acetylation of lignocellulosic fibers improves thermal stability, dispersion in the polymer matrix, and compatibility with the polymer matrix...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{fixed bed}} gasifiers, the char bed {{gasification}} zone where char is converted into syngas {{plays a major}} role in terms of efficiency and control of the process. This zone is particularly complex as many phenomena compete, i. e. heterogeneous and homogeneous chemical reactions, gas flow in porous medium and flow of solid particles. This paper investigates the mechanical and thermochemical behavior of the char bed gasification zone and focuses particularly on bed compaction. To achieve this, a low-density biomass char from wood chips and a <b>high-density</b> one from <b>wood</b> pellets were gasified in a pilot scale continuous fixed bed reactor. Measurements of profiles were taken along the char bed for temperature, gas species concentration, char composition, char bed density and char particle velocity using fine instrumentation and specific char and gas sampling techniques. In our operating conditions, the char bed reactive zone is 3 times longer for chips (45 cm) than for pellets (16 cm). We show that pelletization has no effect on: char bed compaction, final char conversion (about 95 %) and syngas quality (16 % H- 2 and 13 % CO). Finally, we discuss char bed compaction and the main phenomena that control it in order to propose a line of inquiry for modeling...|$|R
40|$|Light-weight {{materials}} {{based on}} wood for interior fittings and furniture {{have been of}} interest {{for at least the}} last fifty years, mainly for cost-reducing reasons. Today, the increasing care of the environment and the growing interest in the concept of a sustainable society provide further impulses for the development of light-weight materials. A common consequence of the reduction in weight of such materials is deterioration in the mechanical properties, e. g. strength, stiffness and shape stability, compared to those of solid wood. New solutions for e. g. connections and mountings are also needed. Today, new panel materials are required where the disadvantages of conventional light-weight materials are less prominent and with aesthetic and tactile properties close to those of natural wood. In this paper, a new type of light-weight panel is presented. The panel is cross-laminated in three layers and consists throughout of solid wood. The weight reduction is a consequence of the hollow middle-layer construction. The intention of the construction is to make it possible to mix species in the panel, e. g. a high-quality and <b>high-density</b> <b>wood</b> on the surface and a low-quality wood with low weight in the core, and thus to optimize the properties of the panel for a specific purpose and to keep costs down at the same time. In this first study, however, the whole panel is made of Scots pine. Bending tests show that the glue-line between the outer layers and the core is critical for the mechanical performance of the panel and this has to be developed further. This study shows that this light-weight panel {{can be used as a}} single component or in a system with other components for interior fittings and furniture. The current design of this light-weight panel has some deficiencies but, in addition to its low weight, it has the potential to provide the mechanical, aesthetic and tactile properties asked for...|$|E
