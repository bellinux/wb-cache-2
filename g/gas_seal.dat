25|$|The 45 caliber Canon de 164mm Modèle 1893 gun was {{a typical}} {{built-up}} French heavy gun of its period. It used a Welin interrupted-screw breech and bagged propellant with a de Bange obdurator {{to get a good}} <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> during firing. It was replaced by the Mle 1893/96 gun which used a plastic seal for the obdurator, differed {{in the construction of the}} gun, had a slightly longer barrel of 46.6 calibers and the newer gun was able to fire a new HE shell further than that used by the older gun.|$|E
25|$|The {{method by}} which Glock barrels are rifled is {{somewhat}} unusual; instead of using a traditional broaching machine to cut the rifling into the bore, the Glock process involves beating a slowly rotating mandrel through the bore to obtain the hexagonal or octagonal shape. As a result, the barrel's thickness {{in the area of}} each groove is not compromised as with conventional square-cut barrels. This has the advantage of providing a better <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> behind the projectile as the bore has a slightly smaller diameter, which translates into more efficient use of the combustion gases trapped behind the bullet, slightly greater (consistency in) muzzle velocities, and increased accuracy and ease of maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Škoda {{designed}} it for export and Turkey ordered a batch, but only received two before the Germans occupied Czechoslovakia in March 1939. It was a stablemate of the Škoda 21cm Kanone 39 and used {{virtually the same}} mounting and transport arrangements. It used an interrupted screw breech with a deBange obturator to provide the <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> with bagged propellant. The carriage revolved on a ball-race firing platform {{that had to be}} dug-in before firing, a task that took six to eight hours to accomplish. It broke down into three loads for transport, the barrel, carriage and the ground platform. A modified version entered service in 1942 as the H 39/40 although the changes merely simplified production. A total of eighteen were delivered to Germany.|$|E

25|$|The 12-inch/40 calibre Canon de 305 mm Modèle 1893/96 gun was {{a typical}} {{built-up}} French heavy gun of its period. It used a Welin interrupted-screw breech and bagged propellant with a de Bange obturator {{to get a good}} <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> during firing. It was mounted in twin-gun turrets which had a couple of unusual features. First, most of the turret's operating machinery was housed inside the turret, with only an armored tube to protect the ammunition hoists. This made little difference in the overall weight of the turret, but did raise the machinery higher in the ship than the turrets of other nations, which did have implications for stability. Secondly, they used a hydraulic pivot to lift the turret when it rotated; this was lowered onto a seating ring when the turret was in the proper position to fire. Each turret had a nominal 300° of traverse, although each ship had its own specific limitations.|$|E

50|$|Dry <b>gas</b> <b>seals</b> are non-contacting, dry-running {{mechanical}} face seals that {{consist of}} a mating (rotating) ring and a primary (stationary) ring. When operating, lifting geometry in the rotating ring generates a fluid-dynamic lifting force causing the stationary ring to separate and create {{a gap between the}} two rings. Dry <b>gas</b> <b>seals</b> are mechanical seals but use other chemicals and functions so that they do not contaminate a process. These seals are typically used in a harsh working environment such as oil exploration, extraction and refining, petrochemical industries, gas transmission and chemical processing.|$|R
40|$|TutorialMechanical seals {{continue}} to be the predominant technology for shaft sealing in centrifugal pumps and other rotating equipment.

In a dual pressurized <b>seal</b> (Arrangement 3), <b>gas</b> <b>seals</b> can provide unique benefits in terms of energy costs, reliability, and emissions control. Dual <b>gas</b> <b>seals</b> however require special considerations when reviewing potential applications.

In addition, the success of the installation will depend on the design and reliability of the gas supply system.

40|$|Lecturepg. 37 - 43 A {{compressor}} in {{a natural}} gas gathering service experienced multiple seal failures on the discharge end.

It is shown that such groove geometries enhance the load carrying capacity of the seal through increased hydrodynamic lift. This is as the result of enhanced localised wedge flow particularly with a reduced seal gap. Therefore, there is the opportunity of gap minimisation, whilst reducing leakage rate and power loss. For given operating loading, kinematic and thermal conditions as well as seal geometry and topography, the operating minimum film thickness may be considered as the main design parameter...|$|R

The installation of these dry <b>gas</b> <b>seals</b> {{is one of}} the first applications to propylene refrigeration service in the United States. The new seal design eliminated seal oil contamination of the compressor and downstream heat exchangers which led to decreased efficiency, effectiveness, and subsequent loss of ethylene production. The seals also reduced the capital investment for a flare system upgrade project $ 1. 5 MM, by decreasing propylene losses during system shutdowns caused by existing seal system shortcomings. This retrofit was unique in several ways. The original compressor manufacturer had no experience with dry <b>gas</b> <b>seals</b> installed in their equipment. They were very willing to cooperate in this venture, but only to the point of providing dimensional data and engineering review. Due to the "sold-out" condition of the ethylene market, this installation had to be accomplished during a limited shutdown. In order to minimize downtime, an innovative installation method was developed which eliminated opening compressor casings even though the new design required removing-a shaft sleeve. To demonstrate the feasibility of this method, a mock up was built simulating working conditions to develop techniques and tooling to remove the shaft sleeve...|$|R
