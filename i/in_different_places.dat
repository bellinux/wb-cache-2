5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of livestock}} {{was driven by}} the need to have food on hand when hunting was unproductive. The desirable characteristics of a domestic animal are that it should be useful to man, should be able to thrive in his company, should breed freely and be easy to tend. Domestication was not a single event, but a process repeated at various periods <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>places.</b> Sheep and goats were the animals that accompanied the nomads in the Middle East, while cattle and pigs were associated with more settled communities.|$|E

5|$|There {{is no one}} way to do Archaeoastronomy. The {{divisions}} between archaeoastronomers tend not to be between the physical scientists and the social scientists. Instead it tends to depend on the location of kind of data available to the researcher. In the Old World, there is little data but the sites themselves; in the New World, the sites were supplemented by ethnographic and historic data. The effects of the isolated development of archaeoastronomy <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>places</b> can still often be seen in research today. Research methods can be classified as falling into one of two approaches, though more recent projects often use techniques from both categories.|$|E
5|$|These ore bodies formed <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>places</b> along a ring {{fault in}} the caldera. About 50 million {{years after they}} were deposited, the tectonic plate of which they were a part {{collided}} with another small plate {{and then with the}} proto-North American continent. The collisions, which welded the plates to the continent, folded the Cleopatra tuff {{in such a way that}} the two ore bodies ended up on opposite sides of a fold called the Jerome anticline.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{smelting}} was independently invented <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>places.</b> It {{was probably}} discovered in China before 2800 BC, in Central America around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting {{was invented in}} 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK, at 2280 to 1890 BC. Ötzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300–3200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest an involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led {{to the discovery of}} iron smelting. Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.|$|E

5|$|Elara's archers, {{shooting}} from the walls, inflicted heavy casualties on the attackers, while soldiers {{on top of}} the walls prevented any attempt to breach the wall by puring down molten metal on them. The elephant Kandula, attempting to break the southern gate, was injured in such an attack. After tending to his injuries and protecting him using thick animal hides, Dutthagamani encouraged Kandula and drove him against the wall. The wall was breached and Dutthagamani's army entered the city. The ten champions, unwilling to enter through an opening made by another, destroyed the wall themselves <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>places</b> and broke into the city. Led by them, Dutthagamani's army destroyed the defenders and took control of the fortress city of Vijithapura. The survivors retreated to Anuradhapura.|$|E
5|$|Hillforts {{developed}} in the Late Bronze and Early Iron ages, around {{the start of the}} 1st millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in prehistoric Britain and their purpose has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>places</b> from the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze and, as a result, trading patterns shifted. The old elites lost their economic and social status and power passed into the hands of a new group of people.|$|E
5|$|In Greek folklore, vampirism {{could occur}} through various means: being excommunicated, desecrating a {{religious}} day, committing a great crime, or dying alone. Other causes included having a cat jump across one's grave, eating meat from a sheep {{killed by a}} wolf, and being cursed. Vrykolakas were usually thought to be indistinguishable from living people, giving rise to many folk tales with this theme. Crosses and antidoron (blessed bread) from the church were used as wards <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>places.</b> To prevent vampires from rising from the dead, their hearts were pierced with iron nails while resting in their graves, or their bodies burned and the ashes scattered. Because the Church opposed burning people who had received the myron of chrismation in the baptism ritual, cremation was considered a last resort.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{accounts}} of ancient versions were rewritten by distinguished scholars, who were leaders in their several departments. The early part of Volume I was enriched from the admirable book on “Greek and Latin Palaeography”, by Edward Maunde Thompson. Many corrections suggested by eminent scholars were introduced <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>places</b> throughout the book. H. J. White rewrote the chapter on Latin versions. G. H. Gwilliam, editor of the Peshitta, helped to improve the passages on the Peshitta and the Curetonian Version. H. Deane made an additions {{to the treatment of}} the Harkleian Version. A. C. Headlam made a revision of the long chapter on the Egyptian versions; F. C. Conybeare, rewrote the sections on the Armenian and Georgian versions; Margoliouth rewrote the sections on the Arabic and Ethiopic versions; J. M. Bebb rewrote the section on the Slavonic version; James W. Bright rewrote the section on the Anglo-Saxon Version.|$|E
5|$|The South Island's southernmost point, Slope Point, {{projects}} {{near the}} southwestern {{corner of the}} Catlins. To the west of this lies Waipapa Point, often considered the boundary of the Catlins region, beyond which lies the swampy land around {{the mouth of the}} Mataura River at the eastern end of Toetoes Bay. But various people place the western boundary of the Catlins region <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>places,</b> and some more stringent definitions exclude even Slope Point. A proposed boundary circulated in 2009 by the New Zealand Geographic Board ran roughly north from Slope Point, then inland around the Catlins Ranges and east to Nugget Point. Tourist organisations objected, asking that the boundary be moved further west to include Fortrose.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh's stylistic {{developments}} are usually {{linked to the}} periods he spent living <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>places</b> across Europe. He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout. His evolution as an artist was slow, and {{he was aware of}} his painterly limitations. He moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill. Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes, and that Van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation.|$|E

30|$|Obtaining a group ranking or {{a winning}} {{candidate}} from individuals’ preferences {{on a set}} of alternatives is an important group decision problem with social choice and voting system implications. In a voting system, each voter ranks the alternatives based on his/her preference, so that each alternative may receive <b>different</b> votes <b>in</b> <b>different</b> ranking <b>places.</b> Assume that each voter selects k out of n alternatives provided k[*]≤[*]n and ranks them from the most to the least preferred. Using the scoring rule, a well-known ranking system, the total score of each candidate is the weighted sum of votes he or she receives <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>place,</b> where the value 1 is assigned to the most important alternative and n to the least important. Determining the weights used for the <b>different</b> <b>places</b> is clearly an important issue.|$|R
5|$|Literary scholar M. Keith Booker {{argues that}} Vargas Llosa perfects the {{technique}} of interlacing dialogues in his novel The Green House. By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates {{the illusion of a}} flashback. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>places.</b> This technique is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using {{near the end of his}} first novel, The Time of the Hero. However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in The Green House the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space. In contrast, Captain Pantoja and the Special Service employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts. This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf's mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.|$|E
