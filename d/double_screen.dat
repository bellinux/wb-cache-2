Beyond the platform stretch the two wings, one [...] of which is itself a mosque of great architectural merit. In the [...] center of the whole design the mausoleum occupies a square of 186 [...] feet, with the angles deeply truncated so as to form an unequal [...] octagon. The main feature in this central pile is the great dome, [...] which swells upward to nearly two-thirds of a sphere and tapers at [...] its extremity into a pointed spire crowned by a crescent. Beneath [...] it an enclosure of marble trellis-work surrounds {{the tomb of the}} [...] princess and of her husband, the Emperor. Each corner of the [...] mausoleum is covered by a similar though much smaller dome erected [...] on a pediment pierced with graceful Saracenic arches. Light is [...] admitted into the interior through a <b>double</b> <b>screen</b> of pierced [...] marble, which tempers the glare of an Indian sky while its whiteness [...] prevents the mellow effect from degenerating into gloom. The [...] internal decorations consist of inlaid work in precious stones, such [...] as agate, jasper, etc., with which every squandril or salient point [...] in the architecture is richly fretted. Brown and violet marble is [...] also freely employed in wreaths, scrolls, and lintels to relieve the [...] monotony of white wall. In regard to color and design, the interior [...] of the Taj may rank first in the world for purely decorative [...] workmanship; while the perfect symmetry of its exterior, once seen [...] can never be forgotten, nor the aerial grace of its domes, rising [...] like marble bubbles into the clear sky. The Taj represents the most [...] highly elaborated stage of ornamentation reached by the [...] Indo-Mohammedan builders, the stage in which the architect ends and [...] the jeweler begins. In its magnificent gateway the diagonal [...] ornamentation at the corners, which satisfied the designers of the [...] gateways of Itimad-ud-doulah and Sikandra mausoleums is superseded [...] by fine marble cables, in bold twists, strong and handsome. The [...] triangular insertions of white marble and large flowers have in like [...] manner given place to fine inlaid work. Firm perpendicular lines in [...] black marble with well proportioned panels of the same material are [...] effectively used in the interior of the gateway. On its top the [...] Hindu brackets and monolithic architraves of Sikandra are replaced [...] by Moorish carped arches, usually single blocks of red sandstone, in [...] the Kiosks and pavilions which adorn the roof. From the pillared [...] pavilions a magnificent view is obtained of the Taj gardens below, [...] with the noble Jumna river at their farther end, and the city and [...] fort of Agra in the distance. From this beautiful and splendid [...] gateway one passes up a straight alley shaded by evergreen trees [...] cooled by a broad shallow piece of water running along the middle of [...] the path to the Taj itself. The Taj is entirely of marble and gems. [...] The red sandstone of the other Mohammedan buildings has entirely [...] disappeared, or rather the red sandstone which used to form the [...] thickness of the walls, is in the Taj itself overlaid completely [...] with white marble, and the white marble is itself inlaid with [...] precious stones arranged in lovely patterns of flowers. A feeling [...] of purity impresses itself on the eye and the mind from the absence [...] of the coarser material which forms so invariable a material in Agra [...] architecture. The lower wall and panels are covered with tulips, [...] oleanders, and fullblown lilies, in flat carving on the white [...] marble; and although the inlaid work of flowers done in gems is very [...] brilliant when looked at closely, there is on the whole but little [...] color, and the all-prevailing sentiment is one of whiteness, [...] silence, and calm. The whiteness is broken only by the fine color [...] of the inlaid gems, by lines in black marble, and by delicately [...] written inscriptions, also in black, from the Koran. Under the dome [...] of the vast mausoleum a high and beautiful screen of open tracery in [...] white marble rises around the two tombs, or rather cenotaphs of the [...] emperor and his princess; and in this marvel of marble the carving [...] has advanced from the old geometrical patterns to a trellis-work of [...] flowers and foliage, handled with great freedom and spirit. The two [...] cenotaphs {{in the center of the}} exquisite enclosure have no carving [...] except the plain Kalamdan or oblong pen-box on the tomb of Emperor [...] Shah Jehan. But both cenotaphs are inlaid with flowers made of [...] costly gems, and with the ever graceful oleander scroll." ...|$|E

These screening mechanisms fit into three broad classes; we investigate theories which are capable of exhibiting more than one type of screening. Specifically, we focus on a simple model which exhibits both Vainshtein and kinetic screening. We point out that due to the two characteristic length scales in the problem, the type of screening that dominates depends on {{the mass of the}} sourcing object, allowing for different phenomenology at different scales. We consider embedding this <b>double</b> <b>screening</b> phenomenology in a broader cosmological scenario and show that the simplest examples that exhibit <b>double</b> <b>screening</b> are radiatively stable.

40|$|A <b>double</b> <b>screening</b> {{procedure}} (DSP), {{which controls}} for individual unit misclassification error (IME) {{as well as}} average outgoing quality (AOQ), for quality control applications is developed. Screening involves selecting items whose performance is within specifications based on observing one or more correlated surrogate (screening) variables {{in lieu of the}} performance variable directly. In <b>double</b> <b>screening,</b> two screening variables, which are correlated to a performance variable, are observed sequentially, rather than simultaneously as in a single screening plan (SSP); namely, (l) one screening variable is used first to make one of three decisions [...] -accept, reject, or undecided [...] -according to the magnitude of the individual nonconforming probability (equivalent to the IME for an accepted item); (2) after this first screening, the second screening variable is employed to screen the undecided items. Assuming conditions of normality, formulae for computing the selection ratio (proportion of accepted items) and AOQ are derived for a DSP. The impact of the intercorrelation between two screening variables on the sequencing of a DSP and the performance between an SSP versus DSP are examined. A DSP reduces inspection cost considerably relative to an SSP employing two screening variables. Producer's risk is also diminished at a nominal sacrifice in consumer's risk. Implementation of a DSP requires only the use of several simple formulas and readily available standard normal tables. reliability: inspection, statistics: sampling, decision analysis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Mosquitoes are vectors {{for many}} {{diseases}} such as malaria. Insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying of insecticides are the principal malaria vector control tools used to prevent malaria in the tropics. Other interventions aim at reducing man-vector contact. For example, house screening provides additive or synergistic effects to other implemented measures. We used commercial screen materials made of polyester, polyethylene or polypropylene to design novel mosquito screens that provide remarkable additional benefits to those commonly used in house screening. The novel design {{is based on a}} <b>double</b> <b>screen</b> setup made of a screen with 3 D geometric structures parallel to a commercial mosquito screen creating a trap between the two screens. Owing to the design of the 3 D screen, mosquitoes can penetrate the 3 D screen from one side but cannot return through the other side, making it a unidirectional mosquito screen. Therefore, the mosquitoes are trapped inside the <b>double</b> <b>screen</b> system. The permissiveness of both sides of the 3 D screens for mosquitoes to pass through was tested in a wind tunnel using the insectary strain of Anopheles stephensi. Results Among twenty-five tested 3 D screen designs, three designs from the cone, prism, or cylinder design groups were the most efficient in acting as unidirectional mosquito screens. The three cone-, prism-, and cylinder-based screens allowed, on average, 92, 75 and 64 % of Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes released into the wind tunnel to penetrate the permissive side and 0, 0 and 6 % of mosquitoes to escape through the non-permissive side, respectively. Conclusions A cone-based 3 D screen fulfilled the study objective. It allowed capturing 92 % of mosquitoes within the <b>double</b> <b>screen</b> setup inside the wind tunnel and blocked 100 % from escaping. Thus, the cone-based screen effectively acted as a unidirectional mosquito screen. This 3 D screen-based trap design could therefore be used in house screening as a means of avoiding infective bites and reducing mosquito population size...|$|E
40|$|In 2014 a {{greenhouse}} experiment was executed with a high-wire cucumber crop {{to measure the}} impact of a multiple layer system of energy screens. The screen systems that have been tested were: • 2 layers of aluminized cloth with a 5 cm cavity operated by a single sliding system closed all night. • 1 layer of high transparency, non-porous PVDF film on a second sliding system, closed all night and when heating was required, usually below an outside radiation level of 150 - 200 W/m 2. • 1 layer of perforated transparent PE film, mounted alongside the <b>double</b> <b>screen,</b> closing as soon as the <b>double</b> <b>screen</b> opened and opening above an outside radiation level of 100 - 150 W/m 2 to reduce the PAR light losses. The result was a 44 % reduction in heating energy in the period of January to May compared to a glasshouse with a single energy screen. Production and product quality were comparable. The intense use of screens influenced the greenhouse climate. Plant temperature remained high because the radiation losses were limited. Since the opening and closing of the screens were very gradual, no shocks in plant temperature or vapour deficit occurred. This greatly reduces the risk of condensation on the leaves leading to botrytis or to a sudden drop in transpiration leading to plant cell damages. This test shows the positive effects of a highly insulated greenhouse and the chances to regain sensible and latent heat comprised in the ventilation losses of transpiration...|$|E
