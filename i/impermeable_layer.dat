5|$|Twyfelfontein is {{situated}} in the Huab valley of the Mount Etjo formation in southern Kunene Region of Namibia, an area formerly known as Damaraland. The rocks containing the art work are situated in a valley flanked by the slopes of a sandstone table mountain. An underground aquifer on an <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer</b> of shale sustains a spring in this otherwise very dry area.|$|E
25|$|Interfaces {{within the}} crust. Typically, a {{horizontal}} detachment zone, a dense, <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer</b> {{or even a}} lithological interface may provide a horizontal plane of weakness which the ascending magma will exploit, forming a sill or lopolith.|$|E
25|$|A {{confined}} aquifer is an aquifer that is overlain by a relatively <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer</b> of rock or substrate {{such as an}} aquiclude or aquitard. If a {{confined aquifer}} follows a downward grade from its recharge zone, groundwater can become pressurized as it flows. This can create artesian wells that flow freely without the need of a pump and rise to a higher elevation than the static water table at the above, unconfined, aquifer.|$|E
30|$|The {{reservoir}} is homogenous, having {{constant and}} uniform thickness with two <b>impermeable</b> <b>layers</b> {{at the top}} and bottom of the formation.|$|R
30|$|Hydrologically, the near-surface crust {{consists}} of an un-saturated layer (or soil water layer), saturated layers (or groundwater <b>layers,</b> aquifers) and <b>impermeable</b> <b>layers.</b> In general, precipitated water: (1) falls onto the ground surface, (2) infiltrates vertically into the unsaturated layer as soil water, (3) reaches the water table of the unconfined aquifer, (4) flows horizontally into the unconfined aquifer as groundwater, and (5) discharges into rivers, lakes and the sea. If, for gravity changes, the water leakage at <b>impermeable</b> <b>layers,</b> and groundwater pumping from confined aquifers, are neglected, then the gravity change must be calculated from the spatiotemporal distributions of the soil water and the unconfined groundwater (Fig. 2).|$|R
50|$|The {{quality of}} soil {{structure}} will decline under most forms of cultivation—the associated mechanical mixing of the soil compacts and shears aggregates and fills pore spaces; it also exposes organic matter to a greater rate of decay and oxidation (Young & Young, 2001). A further consequence of continued cultivation and traffic {{is the development of}} compacted, <b>impermeable</b> <b>layers</b> or pans within the profile.|$|R
25|$|Agricultural {{practices}} such as burning of vegetation and stover in the sloping regions around Lake Colcibolca have resulted in significant sedimentation of the lake. The sediments flowing into the lake are volcanic and become clay when introduced with water forming an <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer</b> of sediment throughout the lake. Navigation on the San Juan River and in Lake Nicaragua {{are affected by the}} progressive sedimentation of both water bodies. Navigation is also an important source of pollution of the water resources, {{due to the fact that}} boats are washed and serviced in both water bodies.|$|E
2500|$|The above diagram {{indicates}} typical flow {{directions in}} a cross-sectional {{view of a}} simple confined or unconfined aquifer system. The system shows two aquifers with one aquitard (a confining or <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer)</b> between them, surrounded by the bedrock aquiclude, which is in contact with a gaining stream (typical in humid regions). The water table and unsaturated zone are also illustrated.|$|E

50|$|The Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System {{is located}} in northeastern Africa, under the nations of Sudan, Libya, Egypt, and Chad, {{covering}} about 2,000,000 km2. It is largely composed of many hydraulically interconnected sandstone aquifers. Some parts of the system {{are considered to be}} confined, if not somewhat leaky, due to <b>impermeable</b> <b>layers</b> such as marine shales. The water was deposited between 4,000 and 20,000 years ago, varying by specific locality.|$|R
5000|$|This trap {{is formed}} by the {{movement}} of permeable and <b>impermeable</b> <b>layers</b> of rock along a fault line. [...] The permeable reservoir rock faults such {{that it is now}} adjacent to an impermeable rock, preventing hydrocarbons from further migration. In some cases, there can be an impermeable substance smeared along the fault line (such as clay) that also acts to prevent migration. This is known as clay smear.|$|R
50|$|Geologic {{overpressure}} in stratigraphic layers {{is caused}} by the inability of connate pore fluids to escape as the surrounding mineral matrix compacts under the lithostatic pressure caused by overlying layers. Fluid escape may be impeded by sealing of the compacting rock by surrounding <b>impermeable</b> <b>layers</b> (such as evaporites, chalk and cemented sandstones). Alternatively, the rate of burial of the stratigraphic layer may be so great that the efflux of fluid is not sufficiently rapid to maintain hydrostatic pressure.|$|R
50|$|A {{perched water}} table (or perched aquifer) is an aquifer that occurs above the {{regional}} water table, in the vadose zone. This occurs {{when there is an}} <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer</b> of rock or sediment (aquiclude) or relatively <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer</b> (aquitard) above the main water table/aquifer but {{below the surface of the}} land. If a perched aquifer's flow intersects the Earth's dry surface, at a valley wall for example, the water is discharged as a spring.|$|E
5000|$|Sands {{may have}} above them an <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer</b> of formation, {{normally}} shale, {{that may be}} hundreds of metres thick. When gas or fluids migrate up through the sand and reach this <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer,</b> pressure may build up {{in the sand and}} push up against the <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer</b> of shale. Over time the pressure can becomes so great that it begins to fracture the shale, making it weaker and easier to penetrate by a drill bit. When a hole is drilled down towards this sand, it will gradually begin to experience faster rates of penetration as it drills through this shale gets closer to the high-pressure sand. It is this trend that the dc-exponent exposes. An examination of the fractured shale that is being drilled will reveal increasingly larger [...] pieces. This is where the term pressure shale comes from.|$|E
5000|$|Interfaces {{within the}} crust. Typically, a {{horizontal}} detachment zone, a dense, <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer</b> {{or even a}} lithological interface may provide a horizontal plane of weakness which the ascending magma will exploit, forming a sill or lopolith.|$|E
5000|$|The {{field is}} within a layer-cake of Pliocene- and Miocene-age sediments, with {{multiple}} producing zones stacked vertically, each zone within a permeable rock layer {{separated from the}} others by <b>impermeable</b> <b>layers.</b> Above the oil field's producing zones is a layer of alluvium of Holocene and Pleistocene age. [...] Nine pools have been identified within the oil field, given in order from top to bottom, with geologic formation, average depth below ground surface, and date of discovery: ...|$|R
40|$|Gullies are {{commonly}} inferred to represent debris flows, lubricated and carried by liquid water that flowed from underground. The inference of groundwater, based principally on the apparent initiation of gullies at specific bedrock layers, {{has not been}} considered for consistency with local geology. Here, I examine gully occurrences for: presence of <b>impermeable</b> <b>layers</b> (aquicludes) in the subsurface, that the layers not tilt away from the gully-bearing walls, and that liquid water could have been available {{at or above the}} gully elevations...|$|R
50|$|In agriculture, soil {{compaction}} {{is a complex}} problem in which soil, crops, weather and machinery interact. External pressure due {{to the use of}} heavy machinery and inappropriate soil management can lead to the compaction of subsoil, creating <b>impermeable</b> <b>layers</b> within the soil that restrict water and nutrient cycles. This process can cause on-site effects such as reduced crop growth, yield and quality as well as off-site effects such as increased surface water run-off, soil erosion, greenhouse gas emissions, eutrophication, reduced groundwater recharge and a loss of biodiversity.|$|R
50|$|Subsurface Textile Irrigation (SSTI) is a {{technology}} {{designed specifically for}} subirrigation in all soil textures from desert sands to heavy clays. A typical subsurface textile irrigation system has an impermeable base layer (usually polyethylene or polypropylene), a drip line running along that base, a layer of geotextile {{on top of the}} drip line and, finally, a narrow <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer</b> on top of the geotextile (see diagram). Unlike standard drip irrigation, the spacing of emitters in the drip pipe is not critical as the geotextile moves the water along the fabric up to 2 m from the dripper. The <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer</b> effectively creates an artificial water table.|$|E
5000|$|Concrete sealers {{are applied}} to {{concrete}} {{to protect it from}} surface damage, corrosion, and staining. They either block the pores in the concrete to reduce absorption of water and salts or form an <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer</b> which prevents such materials from passing.|$|E
50|$|Brown Lake is a perched lake which {{retains its}} water {{due to a}} layer of leaves lining the lake floor and is of {{cultural}} significance to the Quandamooka people of Stradbroke Island. The precipitated matter eventually forms an <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer,</b> preventing water from percolating to the watertable.|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} of {{some aspects of}} the {{occurrence}} of springs in the Netherlands, in particular those of the Veluwe Fringe, but also in Twente and south Limburg. These aspects were compared with those in Germany, France, Belgium and Austria. Along the Veluwe Fringe water percolates through layers of gravel or coarse sand to the <b>impermeable</b> <b>layers</b> of clay or sand and mud be neath; the springs rise where the junction of these layers reaches the surface. Many springs have arisen through excavations higher in the. valleys. Most springs in south Limburg arise where permeable water-holding calcareous <b>layers</b> meet <b>impermeable</b> <b>layers</b> of sand or clay. The temperature and the oxygen content of the large springs of the Veluwe Fringe proved to be constant, those of the smaller ones a bit less so. Their water proved to be generally rich in nitrate, with least solutes near preglacial sands and richest in minerals near loess. In south Limburg it was shown to be very rich in lime. Discussion of microclimate and physical and chemical status of the soil is followed by an extensive description of plant communities, ecology of the woods, the undergrowth on the forest flushes and of plants in the actual springs and their streams...|$|R
30|$|Fluid {{permeability}} in sediments, which {{denotes the}} efficiency of advective transport of water and nutrients through porous media along a hydraulic gradient, is also markedly affected {{by a variety of}} interrelated environmental factors, which in turn affect the nature of microbial communities in situ. In addition to water and nutrients, small microbial cells and particulate organic matter are transported through the more permeable sandstones (Raiders et al. 1986; Huettel and Gust 1992). <b>Impermeable</b> <b>layers</b> act as barriers or cap rocks that limit the transport of fluids and solid materials, including microbial cells (Jørgensen 2000).|$|R
2500|$|Human excreta {{and food}} waste {{do not provide}} optimum {{conditions}} for composting. Usually the water and nitrogen content is too high, particularly when urine is mixed with feces. Additives or [...] "bulking material", such as wood chips, bark chips, sawdust, shredded dry leaves, ash and pieces of paper can absorb moisture. The additives improve pile aeration and increase the carbon to nitrogen ratio. Bulking material also covers feces and reduces insect access. Absent sufficient bulking material, the material may become too compact and form <b>impermeable</b> <b>layers,</b> which leads to anaerobic conditions and odour.|$|R
50|$|Sapping {{typically}} {{occurs in}} permeable sandstones {{associated with high}} water tables underlain by an <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer.</b> Limited {{in its ability to}} travel vertically, water is forced to travel laterally where it eventually seeps out of the ground. Limestones, siltstones, and shales can be found in valleys created by groundwater sapping as well.|$|E
50|$|Summation or {{integration}} of the energy flux in a vertical cross-section of unit width (say 1 m) from the lower flow boundary (the <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer</b> or base) up to the water table in an unconfined aquifer gives the energy flow Fe through the cross-section in E/day per m width of the aquifer.|$|E
50|$|Bioclogging or {{biological}} clogging is clogging of pore space in soil by microbial biomass; their body and their byproducts such as extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). The microbial biomass blocks the pathway {{of water in}} the pore space, forming a certain thickness of <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer</b> in soil, and it reduces the rate of infiltration of water remarkably.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} some two {{dimensional}} infiltration problems are considered. The problems involve infiltration from periodic irrigation channels into a soil which contains impermeable sheets of finite width. The problems {{are reduced to}} boundary integral equations which may be solved numerically using established procedures. Numerical results are obtained to provide {{the distribution of the}} matric flux potential for some particular combinations of impermeable sheets and a semi-circular channel. The results indicate how the length, number and the depth of <b>impermeable</b> <b>layers</b> influences the distribution of water in an irrigated area. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Repetto Sands unit {{consists}} of layers of mudstone, siltstone, and shale, {{and due to}} its depositional environment the general grain size and porosity increase towards the east. It is the same formation which is richly productive in the oil fields of the Los Angeles Basin, such as the Salt Lake and Beverly Hills fields, where it is also folded into anticlinal traps. In the Dos Cuadras field, the oil-bearing strata are at depths ranging from 500 to 4,200 feet below the sea floor, and individual strata are separated by <b>impermeable</b> <b>layers</b> of shaly material.|$|R
50|$|In many cold {{mountain}} areas, snowmelt {{can be a}} key {{mechanism by}} which landslide initiation can occur. This can be especially significant when sudden increases in temperature lead to rapid melting of the snow pack. This water can then infiltrate into the ground, which may have <b>impermeable</b> <b>layers</b> below the surface due to still-frozen soil or rock, leading to rapid increases in pore water pressure, and resultant landslide activity. This effect can be especially serious when the warmer weather is accompanied by precipitation, which both adds to the groundwater and accelerates the rate of thawing.|$|R
50|$|The {{river is}} a 'perch' stream, flowing over {{a bed of}} {{impermeable}} material {{on top of a}} porous substrate. This state is only quasi-stable, since in periods of low rainfall the water table drops below the level of the <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer.</b> If ground works are then carried out which damage this layer, the river can sink into the porous substrate and disappear.|$|E
5000|$|A recent Department of Environmental Conservation {{report that}} tested {{residential}} blocks above the spill area {{concluded that there}} is no evidence of either oil or dangerous vapors seeping up into people's homes. Brooklyn Paper columnist Tom Gilbert wrote, [...] "This stands to reason, as the spilled oil tends to lie deep underground, capped by a nearly <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer</b> of clay." ...|$|E
50|$|Derivation of the {{equation}} For the derivation of {{the equation}} Hooghoudt used the law of Darcy, the summation of circular potential functions and, for {{the determination of the}} influence of the <b>impermeable</b> <b>layer,</b> de method of mirror images and superposition. Hooghoudt published tables for the determination of the equivalent depth (d), because the function (F) in d = F (L,Di-Dd,r) consists of long series of terms.|$|E

40|$|A natural {{geothermal}} reservoir is an aquifer generally in liquid phase confined between two <b>impermeable</b> <b>layers</b> of rock. Drilling of such reservoirs causes a decompression {{which allows the}} in-situ vaporization of some water {{and the development of}} a dual-phase flow. Dual-phase flow is directed by the fractures of the reservoir; energy extinction is mainly determined by heat and mass transfers between the rock and the fluids. A large part of the energy stored in the reservoir is the heat of the rock, so the knowledge of these two interconnected mechanisms is very important to appreciate the behavior of {{geothermal reservoir}}s...|$|R
30|$|BSR depths are {{controlled}} by in situ temperatures and pressures, and a gas supply to the formation {{is required for the}} development of BSRs. Although the trough floor and the prism toe were theoretically deep enough for BSRs to develop, BSRs were generally not observed in these regions, even at great water depths. This suggested a lack of methane in these regions, owing to young horizontal trench sediments consisting of alternating permeable and <b>impermeable</b> <b>layers</b> (e.g., Ashi et al. 2002). In addition, picking BSRs that parallel the reflectors of sedimentary layers was technically challenging with low-amplitude reflectors.|$|R
