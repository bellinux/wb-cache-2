5|$|The Clear View School {{was built}} in 1917 by Frank Vanderlip on his Beechwood {{property}} as the Scarborough School, the first Montessori school in the United States.

5|$|Members of the Vanderlip family, {{particularly}} Virginia Vanderlip Schoales, {{continued to}} administer the school for sixty years. A 1959 development plan made way for a new primary school in 1961, new science facilities in 1962, expansion of the library in 1963, {{and the creation of}} an organization for alumni, of whom there were more than a thousand living in 1977. The school was unable to obtain sufficient funding and closed in 1978. In 1980, the buildings and property were taken over by The Clear View School, which opened in September 1981 after major renovations. The school runs a <b>day</b> <b>treatment</b> program for 83 students from nursery school age to 21, and is sponsored by the Association for Mentally Ill Children of Westchester; its program involves education, treatment, and crisis intervention and parent involvement.|$|E
5|$|The Scarborough Day School was {{a private}} school in Scarborough-on-Hudson, in Briarcliff Manor, New York. Frank and Narcissa Vanderlip {{established}} the school in 1913 at their estate, Beechwood. The school, a nonsectarian nonprofit college preparatory day school, taught students at pre-kindergarten to twelfth grade levels and had small class sizes, with total enrollment rarely exceeding 150 students. Since 1980, the buildings and property have been owned by The Clear View School, which runs a <b>day</b> <b>treatment</b> program for 83 students. The current school still uses the Scarborough School's theater, which was opened in 1917. The school campus is a contributing property to the Scarborough Historic District.|$|E

5|$|Briarcliff Manor {{has been}} home {{to a number of}} schools. Long Hill School was a public school in Scarborough until 1912, with about 70 {{students}}, two classrooms, and two teachers. Dr. Holbrook's Military School was on Holbrook Road from 1866 to 1915. Miss Tewksbury's School and later Mrs. Marshall's Day & Boarding School for Little Girls was at Dysart House. Miss Knox's School ran from 1905 in Pocantico Lodge, a hotel on Pleasantville Road under Briarcliff Lodge management. When it burned down in 1912, the school moved to Tarrytown and then to Cooperstown. Since 1954, the Knox School has been located at St. James, New York.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundLung mucociliary {{clearance}} is impaired {{in patients}} with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Treatment guidelines recommend that patients with COPD receive maintenance therapy with long-acting beta-agonists and anticholinergic agents. MethodsTwenty-four patients with mild to moderate COPD received formoterol (12  μg, twice daily from Turbuhaler® dry powder inhaler (DPI)) or tiotropium (18  μg, once daily from Handihaler® DPI) for 14 days. They also received single doses of formoterol, tiotropium, salbutamol (200  μg) and placebo. A radioaerosol technique was used to assess the effects on mucus clearance of 14 <b>days</b> <b>treatment</b> with formoterol or tiotropium, as well as single doses of these drugs. ResultsThe 4  h whole lung retention of radioaerosol was significantly higher after 14 <b>days</b> <b>treatment</b> with tiotropium (P =  0. 016), but not after 14 <b>days</b> <b>treatment</b> with formoterol. However, patients bronchodilated after 14 <b>days</b> <b>treatment</b> with both drugs, so that the deposited radioaerosol may have had an increased distance to travel in order to be cleared by mucociliary action. A single dose of formoterol enhanced radioaerosol clearance significantly compared to other single dose treatments (P <  0. 05). ConclusionFormoterol (12  μg) enhances mucus clearance {{in patients with}} mild to moderate COPD when given as a single dose, and may do so when given for 14 days. Studies of longer duration would be needed in order to assess the effects of the study drugs on mucus clearance when they are used for long-term maintenance therapy...|$|R

[...] Its objectives are: [...] 1. to identify the at-risk youth’s individual strengths and weaknesses, 2. to provide an individualized environment in which the at-risk youth can develop skills, and 3. to alter the natural environment of the at-risk youth so that new acquired skills are nurtured and encouraged. [...] To achieve these objectives, C.I.T.Y. offers academic remediation in reading, math, language; intensive counseling that involves behavior modification, consumer education, and job readiness training. [...] After all objectives have been met, C.I.T.Y. provides GED preparation, return to public school, and placement into technical school, college, job, or military service. [...] In 1983, C.I.T.Y. Program of Etowah County (Gadsden) received the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges Unique and Innovative Project Award.
