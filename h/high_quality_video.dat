25|$|UAVs provide day-night, {{real-time}} imagery reconnaissance, surveillance, {{and target}} acquisition. Its unique capabilities {{can also be}} used to support real-time target engagement, assisting in the control of fires/supporting arms and maneuver. The UAV provides <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>video</b> imagery for artillery or naval gunfire adjustment, battle damage assessment, and reconnaissance over land or sea. It is capable of both day and night operations using TV or forward-looking infrared cameras. UAV squadrons are under the ADCON of the ACE. The MAGTF commander retains OPCON because of the limited number of UAV assets and the critical reconnaissance capabilities they provide to the entire force. Mission tasking is exercised through the surveillance and reconnaissance center.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} quality-selection policy for Quality of Experience (QoE) {{demanding}} video streaming in wireless networks. The proposed policy predicts the TCP throughput and adapts video segment requests {{in order to}} assure high QoE by {{taking into account the}} client buffer level. We introduce the concept of Affordable delivery Time (AT) and we design a buffer-based algorithm, hereafter referred to as Buffer-based lolyPOP (BPOP). The AT accounts for the ideal chunk download time which equals the chunk playout time, {{as well as for the}} client buffer status. In a nutshell, the buffer-based AT favors the download of <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> <b>video</b> chunks when the client has more buffered data than a pre-established target buffer occupancy. Conversely, AT inhibits <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> <b>video</b> chunks download when the buffer is below the targeted occupancy...|$|R
