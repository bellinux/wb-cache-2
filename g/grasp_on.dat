5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter {{was born out of}} her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid <b>grasp</b> <b>on</b> who the characters were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved on to another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, Real Madrid {{had lost its}} <b>grasp</b> <b>on</b> the Liga title until a new cohort of {{home-grown}} stars brought domestic success back to the club. Spanish sport journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre ("Vulture's Cohort"), which {{was derived from the}} nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manuel Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza; all five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy. With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe {{during the second half of}} the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish cup and three Spanish Super Cups. In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club.|$|E

5|$|Mantises {{have two}} spiked, {{grasping}} forelegs ("raptorial legs") in which prey items are caught and held securely. In most insect legs, including the posterior four {{legs of a}} mantis, the coxa and trochanter combine as an inconspicuous base of the leg; in the raptorial legs, however, the coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment {{about as long as}} the femur, which is a spiky part of the grasping apparatus (see illustration). Located {{at the base of the}} femur is a set of discoidal spines, usually four in number, but ranging from none to as many as five depending on the species. These spines are preceded by a number of tooth-like tubercles, which, along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip, give the foreleg of the mantis its <b>grasp</b> <b>on</b> its prey. The foreleg ends in a delicate tarsus used as a walking appendage, made of four or five segments and ending in a two-toed claw with no arolium.|$|E

Whether {{the adoption of the}} classical Alexander for the future Alexander I of Scotland (either for Pope Alexander II or for Alexander the Great) and the biblical David for the future David I of Scotland represented a recognition that William of Normandy would not be easily removed, or was due to the repetition of Anglo-Saxon royal name—another Edmund had preceded Edgar—is not known.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{adaptive}} grasping method that finds stable <b>grasps</b> <b>on</b> novel objects. The main contributions {{of this paper}} is in the computation of the probability of success of grasps in the vicinity of an already applied grasp. Our method performs grasp adaptions by simulating tactile data for grasps {{in the vicinity of the}} current grasp. The simulated data is used to evaluate hypothetical grasps and thereby guide us toward better grasps. We demonstrate the applicability of our method by constructing a system that can plan, apply and adapt <b>grasps</b> <b>on</b> novel objects. Experiments are conducted on objects from the YCB object set and the success rate of our method is 88 %. Our experiments show that the application of our grasp adaption method improves grasp stability significantly.

40|$|Abstract—The {{physical}} properties of highly deformable {{objects such as}} clothing poses a challenging problem for autonomously acting systems. Especially, grasping and manipulation require new approaches that can accommodate for an object’s variable and changing appearance. In this paper, we present {{a system that is}} capable of fully autonomously transforming a clothing item from a random crumpled configuration into a folded state. We describe a method to compute valid <b>grasp</b> poses <b>on</b> the cloth which accounts for deformability. Our algorithm includes a novel fold detection and grasp generation strategy, which suggests <b>grasp</b> poses <b>on</b> cloth folds. Machine learning techniques are used to evaluate these grasp poses. In our experiments, we use a stock PR 2 robot whose two arms alternatingly perform <b>grasps</b> <b>on</b> a T-shirt equipped with fiducial markers. The goal of this grasp sequence is to bring the T-shirt into a configuration from which the robot can fold it. In several experiments, we demonstrate the performance of our approach. I...|$|R

25|$|Crittenden {{proposes that}} {{both kinds of}} {{information}} can be split off from consciousness or behavioural expression as a 'strategy' to maintain the availability of an attachment figure: 'Type A strategies were hypothesized {{to be based on}} reducing perception of threat to reduce the disposition to respond. Type C was hypothesized to be based on heightening perception of threat to increase the disposition to respond' Type A strategies split off emotional information about feeling threatened and type C strategies split off temporally-sequenced knowledge about how and why the attachment figure is available. By contrast, type B strategies effectively use both kinds of information without much distortion. For example: a toddler may have come to depend upon a type C strategy of tantrums in working to maintain the availability of an attachment figure whose inconsistent availability has led the child to distrust or distort causal information about their apparent behaviour. This may lead their attachment figure to get a clearer <b>grasp</b> <b>on</b> their needs and the appropriate response to their attachment behaviours. Experiencing more reliable and predictable information about the availability of their attachment figure, the toddler then no longer needs to use coercive behaviours with the goal of maintaining their caregiver's availability and can develop a secure attachment to their caregiver since they trust that their needs and communications will be heeded.|$|E
