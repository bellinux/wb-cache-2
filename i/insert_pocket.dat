40|$|Large {{improvements}} in cutting tool design and technology, including {{the application of}} advanced surface engineering treatments on the cemented carbide insert, have been achieved in the last decades to enhance tool performance. However, the problem of improving the tool body material is not adequately studied. Fatigue {{is the most common}} failure mechanism in cutting tool bodies. Rotating tools, tool {{going in and out of}} cutting engagement, impose dynamic stresses and require adequate fatigue strength of the tool. Working temperatures of milling cutter bodies in the <b>insert</b> <b>pocket</b> can reach up to 600 °C depending on the cutting conditions and material of the workpiece. As a result, steel for this application shall have good hot properties such as high temper resistance and high hot hardness values to avoid plastic deformation in the <b>insert</b> <b>pocket</b> of the cutting tool. Machinability of the steel is also essential, as machining of steel represents a large fraction of the production cost of a milling cutter. This thesis focus on the improvement of the cutting tool performance by the use of steel grades for tool bodies with optimized combination of fatigue strength, machinability and properties at elevated temperatures. The first step was to indentify the certain limit of the sulphur addition for improved machinability which is allowable without reducing the fatigue strength of the milling cutter body below an acceptable level. The combined effect of inclusions, surface condition and geometrical stress concentrator on the fatigue life of the tool steel in smooth specimens and in tool components were studied in bending fatigue. As the fatigue performance of the tools to a large extent depends on the stress relaxation resistance at elevated temperature use, the second step in this research was to investigate the stress relaxation of the commonly used milling cutter body materials and a newly steel developed within the project. Compressive residual stresses were induced by shot peening and their response to mechanical and thermal loading as well as the material substructures and their dislocation characteristics were studied using X-ray diffraction. Softening resistance of two hot work tool steels and a newly developed steel was investigated during high temperature hold times and isothermal fatigue and discussed of with respect to their microstructure. Carbide morphology and precipitation as well as dislocation structure were determined using transmission electron microscopy and X-ray line broadening analysis...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a PCD (polycrystalline diamond) end mill {{with a new}} staggered structure for the milling of CFRP (carbon fiber reinforced plastic). The magnitude and direction of cutting force is decreased and changed by side-edge re-configuration of the structure. The flute and <b>insert</b> <b>pocket</b> of the staggered PCD end mill are designed considering the tool’s stiffness and welding process. The milling process and machining defects of the staggered PCD end mill are analyzed, and the structural parameters of the staggered PCD end mill are determined. The staggered PCD end mill is fabricated {{by the process of}} wire cutting, NC (Numerical Control) machining, high-frequency induction brazing, welding, grinding and passivation. Milling tests of multidirectional CFRP with the staggered PCD end mill is conducted on CNC (Computerized Numerical Control) milling machine. The milling force is measured by a dynamometer. A range analysis of the numerical results of milling force is conducted after milling test, and the influence of milling parameters on milling force is analyzed. A regression model of the milling force is built and verified by experiment. The effects of fiber cutting angle on milling force are obtained through milling CFRP with different fiber orientation angles...|$|E
40|$|Large {{improvements}} in cutting tool design and technology {{have been achieved}} in the last decades. But the problem of improving the tool body material is not adequately studied. In the present study, the different aspects associated with the steel properties as related to the milling cutter body application are reviewed. The working performance of a tool holder depends in particular on the fatigue strength, high temperature properties and machinability of the tool steel used. Rotating tools, tool {{going in and out}} of cutting engagement, impose dynamic stresses and require adequate fatigue strength off the tool. Different publications, as well as internal investigation at Uddeholm Tooling AB show that the working temperatures of milling cutter bodies in the <b>insert</b> <b>pocket</b> vary from 300 to 600 degrees Celsius depending on the cutting conditions and material of the workpiece. As a result, steel for this application needs good hot properties such as high temper resistance, high hot hardness values, etc. Machinability is also essential as machining of steel represents a large fraction of the production cost of a milling cutter. Its complex shape with flutes and insert pockets as well as small thread holes and small deep holes for cooling channels require time consuming and advanced machining operations. The essential properties mentioned above were characterized with the emphasis to the steel type, its microstructure and purity, processing and surface treatment and strong interrelations between them...|$|E

40|$|Performance of {{indexable}} insert {{cutting tools}} {{is not only}} about the performance of cutting inserts. It is also about the cutting tool body, which has to provide a secure and accurate insert positioning as well as its quick and easy handling under severe working conditions. The common damage mechanisms of cutting tool bodies are fatigue and plastic deformation. Cutting tools undergo high dynamic stresses going in and out cutting engagement; as a result, an adequate level of fatigue strength is the essential steel property. Working temperatures of tool bodies in the <b>insert</b> <b>pocket</b> can reach up to 600 °C, why the tool steel requires high softening resistance to avoid plastic deformation. Machinability is also essential, as machining of the steel represents a large fraction of the production cost of a cutting tool. The overall aim of the study is to improve the tool body performance by use of an advanced steel grade with an optimized combination of all the demanding properties. Due to the high-temperature conditions, the thesis concerns mostly hot-work tool steels increasing also the general knowledge of their microstructure, mechanical properties and machinability. Knowing the positive effect of sulphur on machinability of steels, the first step was to indentify a certain limit of the sulphur addition, which would not reduce the fatigue strength of the tool body below an acceptable level. In tool bodies, where the demand on surface roughness was low and a geometrical stress concentrator was present, the addition of sulphur could be up to 0. 09 wt%. Fatigue performance of the cutting tools to a large extent depended on the steel resistance to stress relaxation under high dynamic loading and elevated temperatures. The stress relaxation behaviour, material substructure and dislocation characteristics in low-alloyed and hot-work tool steels were studied using X-ray diffraction under thermal and mechanical loading.  Different tool steels exhibited different stress relaxation resistance depending on their microstructure, temper resistance and working temperature. Hot-work tool steels showed to be more preferable to low-alloyed tool steels because of their ability to inhibit the rearrangement and annihilation of induced dislocations. High-temperature softening resistance of the hot-work tool steels was investigated during high-temperature hold-times and isothermal fatigue and discussed with respect to their microstructure. Carbide morphology and precipitation were determined using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Machinability of a prehardened hot-work tool steel of varying nickel content from 1 to 5 wt% was investigated in end milling and drilling operations. Machining the higher nickel containing steels resulted in longer tool life and generated lower cutting forces and tool/workpiece interface temperature. The difference in machinability of the steels was discussed in terms of their microstructure and mechanical properties. ...|$|E
