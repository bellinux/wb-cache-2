5|$|Butterflies {{are often}} polymorphic, and many species {{make use of}} camouflage, mimicry and aposematism to evade their predators. Some, like the monarch and the painted lady, migrate over long distances. Many {{butterflies}} are attacked by parasites or parasitoids, including wasps, protozoans, flies, and other invertebrates, or are preyed upon by other organisms. Some species are pests because in their larval stages they can damage domestic crops or trees; other species are agents of pollination of some plants. Larvae of a few butterflies (e.g., harvesters) eat harmful insects, and a few are predators of ants, while others live as mutualists in association with ants. Culturally, butterflies are a popular motif <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> and literary arts.|$|E
5|$|Romanticism was {{a complex}} artistic, {{literary}} and intellectual movement that {{originated in the}} second half of the eighteenth century in western Europe, and gained strength during and after the Industrial and French Revolutions.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century {{movement}} {{in the tradition of}} European naturalism. The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene. Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel Adams.|$|E
30|$|The second {{statistical}} exploration that quantified {{the degree}} of structure present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> geometric shapes revealed high structure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>visuals</b> of perfect turnover and nestedness [explanatory power of the minimum model (i.e., the adjusted variance explained): turnover, 0.80; macrophytes, 0.84] (Table  2). Noise, which comprised the difference of these values to 1 (the highest possible variance), was comparatively low (0.20, invertebrates; 0.16 macrophytes) (Table  2). These values changed drastically <b>in</b> <b>the</b> real examples, coinciding with the break up of geometry observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> visuals: invertebrates, 0.26 structure/ 0.74 noise; macrophytes, 0.14 structure/ 0.86 noise (Table  2).

In 1864, Sir Edwin Landseer's Man Proposes, God Disposes caused a stir at the annual Royal Academy exhibition; its depiction of two polar bears, one chewing on a tattered ship's ensign, the other gnawing on a human ribcage, was seen at the time as in poor taste, but has remained {{one of the most powerful}} imaginings of the expedition's final fate. The expedition also inspired numerous popular engravings and illustrations, along with many panoramas, dioramas, and magic lantern shows.|$|E

5|$|Karas {{impressed}} its reviewers {{with its}} animated imagery. Mania Entertainment affirmed its lush imagery {{are enough to}} hook viewers, and certain 2D-3D scenes matched photorealistic standards. They felt Karas could rival or beat live-action films <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> department. DVD Talk commented they saw evidence {{a lot of effort}} went into merging the 2D and 3D animations. They, however, felt setting the scenes in darkness and obscuring points of interest with smoke or other effects marred the high quality imagery. Anime News Network stated the richly detailed images; fast moving action scenes; and visual effects of collapsing buildings, explosions, and blood made Karas one of the best action animation. Reviewers praised the fight scenes between the CG generated karas and mikuras, declaring them realistic, tasteful and stunning. DVD Talk, however, complained the camera jerked and moved all over the place never showing fights cleanly. Mania stated the fights in the later half failed to match those in the first half in terms of beauty, intensity, and variety; the overlaying of characters' face onto their armored forms in the finale detracted from their viewing experience.|$|E

5000|$|Visual Neuroscience is {{a branch}} of {{neuroscience}} that focuses on <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> system of <b>the</b> human body, mainly located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain's <b>visual</b> cortex. <b>The</b> main goal of visual neuroscience is to understand how neural activity results in visual perception, as well as behaviors dependent on vision. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> past, <b>visual</b> neuroscience has focused primarily on how <b>the</b> brain (and <b>in</b> particular <b>the</b> <b>Visual</b> Cortex) responds to light rays projected from static images and onto the retina. [...] While this provides a reasonable explanation for <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> perception of a static image, it does not provide an accurate explanation for how we perceive {{the world as it}} really is, an ever-changing, and ever-moving 3-D environment.

40|$|AbstractIn {{a recent}} study (Fan, Z., & Harris, J. (2008). Perceived spatial {{displacement}} of motion-defined contours in peripheral vision. Vision Research, 48 (28), 2793 – 2804), we demonstrated that virtual contours defined by two regions of dots moving in opposite directions were displaced perceptually <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of motion of <b>the</b> dots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> more eccentric region when the contours were viewed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right <b>visual</b> field. Here, we show that the magnitude and/or direction of these displacements varies in different quadrants of <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> field. When contours were presented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>visual</b> field, <b>the</b> direction of perceived contour displacement was consistent with that when both contours were presented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right <b>visual</b> field. However, this illusory motion-induced spatial displacement disappeared when both contours were presented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>visual</b> field. Also, perceived contour displacement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of the more eccentric dots was larger <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left <b>visual</b> field, perhaps because of a hemispheric asymmetry in attentional allocation. Quadrant-based analyses suggest that the pattern of results arises from opposite directions of perceived contour displacement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper-left and lower-right visual quadrants, which depend on the relative strengths of two effects: a greater sensitivity to centripetal motion, and an asymmetry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> allocation of spatial attention...|$|R

5|$|Sirius is {{a binary}} star system {{consisting}} of two white stars orbiting {{each other with a}} separation of about 20 AU (roughly the distance between the Sun and Uranus) and a period of 50.1 years. The brighter component, termed Sirius A, is a main-sequence star of spectral type early A, with an estimated surface temperature of 9,940K. Its companion, Sirius B, is a star that has already evolved off the main sequence and become a white dwarf. Currently 10,000 times less luminous <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> spectrum, Sirius B was once the more massive of the two. The age of the system has been estimated at around 230 million years. Early in its lifespan it was thought to have been two bluish white stars orbiting each other in an elliptical orbit every 9.1 years. The system emits a higher than expected level of infrared radiation, as measured by IRAS space-based observatory. This may be an indication of dust in the system, and is considered somewhat unusual for a binary star. The Chandra X-ray Observatory image shows Sirius B outshining its bright partner as it is a brighter X-ray source.|$|E

Except for certain single player missions with special objectives, {{there are two ways}} to defeat an opponent: destroy all of the enemy's units or capture their headquarters. The battle system is turn-based. Two to four forces, each headed by a commanding officer (CO), take turns building and commanding units on grid-based maps. Every turn, units, which consist of ground, sea and air units, can move across the different types of terrain and attack enemy units or perform other actions, such as submerging a submarine or resupplying friendly units. Many factors can affect the battle, such as Fog of War, a phenomenon that prevents players from seeing enemy units other than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>visual</b> range of their units; various weather conditions; and CO powers.|$|E
