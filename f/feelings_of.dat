40|$|This {{research}} has investigated {{the relationship between}} <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> disorder and <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> insecurity, among citizens of Yasouj, using broken window theory. Research method is cross-sectional survey and research population includes citizens of Yasouj who are upper 18 years old. 482 cases were selected using random multi-stage sampling method. Measurement tool was a researcher-made questionnaire whose construct validity was established through factor analysis and its reliability was measured using cronbach alpha coefficient. Descriptive findings showed that both rates <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> insecurity is and disorder are high among Yasouj residents. Analytical findings indicated {{that there is a}} positive significant relationship between <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> disorder and <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> insecurity. Explanation <b>of</b> the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> insecurity on the basis <b>of</b> the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> disorder using structural equation model specified that the research model has an ideal goodness of fit and is consistent with empirical data. Structural coefficient <b>of</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> disorder on the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> insecurity is 0. 83 which is significant withregard to T value (13. 3). In addition, <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> disorder can explain 68 % of the variance <b>of</b> the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> insecurity...|$|R

5|$|Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or {{judgment}} that assists in distinguishing right from wrong. Moral judgment may derive from values or norms (principles and rules). In psychological terms conscience {{is often described}} as leading to <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> remorse when a human commits actions that go against his/her moral values and to <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> rectitude or integrity when actions conform to such norms. The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments are or should be based in reason has occasioned debate through much of the history of Western philosophy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of participation motivation on exercise emotion and psychological well-being of marathon participants. The subjects of this study consisted of 241 marathon participants. The result of this study were as follows. First, the subscales of participation motivation, enjoyment, achievement and excitement positively influenced to fun, vigor, pride, achievement, catharsis. And skill development positively influenced to vigor, pride, achievement, catharsis. And external display positively influenced to vigor but, affiliation negatively influenced to vigor, achievement, and catharsis. And amotivation negatively influenced to fun, vigor, pride, catharsis. Second, the subscales of participation motivation, skill development and enjoyment positively influenced to <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> flow, <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> competence, <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> self-realization, hedonic enjoyment. achievement and excitement positively influenced to <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> flow and hedonic enjoyment, external display positively influenced to feeling to flow.

The teacher could emphasize co-planning of the course with students. Discussions and room for students’ personal goals of the course and personal scheduling of course tasks could be pedagogical implications to reduce the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> stress. Warnecke et al. (2011) found that daily listened guided mindfulness practice reduced medical students’ <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> stress.

40|$|Previous {{research}} on the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> knowing for nonrecalled items {{has focused on the}} validity <b>of</b> the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> knowing as a predictor for subsequent performance but generally has overlooked the question of what factors the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> knowing might be based upon. We explored the hypothesis that one factor underlying the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> knowing is the degree of prior learning for the sought-after item. Undergraduates learned a list in which various items were acquired to a criterion of either one correct recall, two correct recalls, or four correct recalls. Four weeks later, the subjects had a recall-retention test, then rank ordered the nonrecalled items in terms <b>of</b> the relative <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> knowing for each of the nonrecalled items, and finally had a recognition test on the nonrecalled items. A major finding (in addition to those summarized {{at the end of the}} article) was that the magnitude <b>of</b> the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> knowing for nonrecalled items increased with the degree of prior learning.

5|$|Roger Sale {{believes}} Andersen {{expressed his}} <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> social and sexual inferiority by creating characters that are inferior to their beloveds. The Little Mermaid, for example, has no soul while her human beloved has a soul as his birthright. In “Thumbelina”, Andersen suggests the toad, the beetle, and the mole are Thumbelina’s inferiors and {{should remain in}} their places rather than wanting their superior. Sale indicates they are not inferior to Thumbelina but simply different. He suggests that Andersen may have done some damage to the animal world when he colored his animal characters with his own <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> inferiority.|$|E

5|$|While the {{individual}} diver cannot predict exactly at what depth {{the onset of}} narcosis will occur on a given day, the first symptoms of narcosis for any given diver are often more predictable and personal. For example, one diver may have trouble with eye focus (close accommodation for middle-aged divers), another may experience <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> euphoria, and another <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> claustrophobia. Some divers report that they have hearing changes, and that the sound their exhaled bubbles make becomes different. Specialist training may help divers to identify these personal onset signs, which may then {{be used as a}} signal to ascend to avoid the narcosis, although severe narcosis may interfere with the judgement necessary to take preventive action.|$|E

In contrast to Airtight's Revenge, A Love Surreal deals more with <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> lust and flirting rather than personal and societal issues.|$|E

40|$|Here we {{question}} the mechanisms underlying the emergence <b>of</b> the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> control {{that can be}} modulated even when the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> being the author of one’s own action is intact. With a haptic robot, participants made series of vertical pointing actions on a virtual surface, which was sometimes postponed by a small temporal delay (15 or 65 ms). Subjects then evaluated their subjective <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> control. Results showed that after temporal distortions, the hand-trajectories were adapted effectively but that the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> control decreased significantly. This was observed even {{in the case of}} subliminal distortions for which subjects did not consciously detect the presence of a distortion. Our findings suggest that both supraliminal and subliminal temporal distortions that occur within a healthy perceptual–motor system impact the conscious experience <b>of</b> the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> control of self-initiated motor actions...|$|R

5|$|A {{survival}} horror storyline {{usually involves}} {{the investigation and}} confrontation of horrific forces, and thus many games transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges.

Also, many survival horror games make use of off-screen sound or other warning cues to notify the player of impending danger. This feedback assists the player, but also creates <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> anxiety and uncertainty.|$|E
