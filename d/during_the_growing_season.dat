5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season,</b> {{the mean}} July {{temperature}} is 18°C (66°F). The average annual rainfall is 630mm (25inches), with 45mm (1.8inches) falling during the harvest month of September. Throughout the year, growers must {{be mindful of}} the hazards of fungal disease and early spring frost.|$|E
5|$|Routine care <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> {{involves}} {{keeping the}} rows free of competing weeds, {{especially when the}} plants are young. The plants are shallow-rooted and do not need {{a great deal of}} water when established. Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks. The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be kept in storage, they should be harvested after the leaves have died back naturally. In dry weather, they can be left {{on the surface of the}} soil for a few days to dry out properly, then they can be placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes. They should be stored in a well-ventilated, cool place such as a shed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{seasonal}} variation and influence factors of emission of greenhouse gasses (CH 4 and N 2 O) {{from the different}} water depths were studied <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>seasons</b> in a marsh wetland of Sanjiang Plain of China. The {{results showed that the}} wetland was a source of both CH 4 and N 2 O <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>seasons</b> and emissions showed conspicuous temporal and spatial variations. Emission rates of CH 4 were higher in July and August while N 2 O were higher in June and July. The highest average CH 4 flux among the four sites was in the water depth at 40 cm with a rate of 37. 00 mg·...|$|R

25|$|Pignut hickory {{grows in}} a humid climate with an average annual {{precipitation}} of 760 to 2,030mm (30 to 80 in) of which 510 to 1,020mm (20 to 40 in) is rain <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season.</b> Average snowfall varies from little to none in the South to 2,540mm (100in) or more {{in the mountains of}} West Virginia, southeastern New York, and southern Vermont (25).|$|E
25|$|The Chardonnay vine has a {{tendency}} to produce excessive foliage which can hamper the ripening process with the vine diverting more energy to its leaves than to producing sugars and phenolics in the grape clusters. This requires Corton-Charlemagne growers to be limit the number of buds they leave with winter pruning and to be active <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> in leaf-pulling and removing excess shoots.|$|E
50|$|The {{climate of}} the North Caucasus region, where most of Russia's {{vineyards}} are located, is typical of a continental region. To counter the severe winters many vine growers will cover their vines over with soil to protect the vines from frost. In the area of Krasnodar there are anywhere from 193-233 frost free days <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>seasons</b> that allow <b>the</b> vines in <b>the</b> area to <b>grow</b> to full ripening.|$|R

25|$|The Margaux {{appellation}} {{encompasses the}} village of Margaux and the neighboring villages of Arsac, Labarde, Soussans and Cantenac. It is the most southerly of Médoc's appellations. This region has the thinnest soil in the region with the highest proportion of gravel that allows the soil to drain very well. The wines from this area are very susceptible to weather effects <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> and harvest.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the pests noted above, vineyards in the Hunter Valley are usually grafted on phylloxera resistant rootstock {{to help keep the}} louse at bay. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> kangaroos are frequent threats to the young buds and shoots of grapevines, requiring tall barb wire fences to keep the hopping creature out. Ever present nuisances near harvest time are the frequent birds that descend upon the area.|$|E
25|$|Several mesoclimates {{exist within}} the area due to various weather and {{geographical}} influences. The open {{southern end of}} the valley floor is cooler <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> due to the proximity of San Pablo Bay while the sheltered, closed northern end is often much warmer. The eastern side of the valley tends to be more arid because winter storms tend to drop much more precipitation on the western mountains and hills.|$|E

50|$|Winter (December through February) is the driest season, with {{an average}} 7.5 in of precipitation. The average {{seasonal}} snowfall is 18.2 in, typically falling from December to March.

25|$|In {{grain and}} cotton crops, urea is often applied {{at the time}} of the last {{cultivation}} before planting. In high rainfall areas and on sandy soils (where nitrogen can be lost through leaching) and where good in-season rainfall is expected, urea can be side- or top-dressed <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season.</b> Top-dressing is also popular on pasture and forage crops. In cultivating sugarcane, urea is side-dressed after planting, and applied to each ratoon crop.|$|E
25|$|In {{the midwestern}} United States, low-till or no-till farming {{techniques}} are usually used. In low-till, fields are covered once, maybe twice, with a tillage implement either ahead of crop planting {{or after the}} previous harvest. The fields are planted and fertilized. Weeds are controlled {{through the use of}} herbicides, and no cultivation tillage is done <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season.</b> This technique reduces moisture evaporation from the soil, and thus provides more moisture for the crop.|$|E

In addition, the consultation and testing that happens <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>seasons</b> and winemaking period can provide feedback that can help a client potentially see a 5-point increase their score over their previous years' average scores for red wines and 6 points for white wine.|$|R

25|$|While {{the climate}} of Pomerol is broadly similar {{to the rest of}} Bordeaux in the {{maritime}} influence, the region's distance from the sea and the Gironde estuary make the climate distinctly more continental than that of the Médoc. This means that Pomerol sees more diurnal temperature variation <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season,</b> between daytime highs and evening lows. Also while the region experiences more rainfall during the spring (which can cause problems for Merlot during flowering) there is overall significantly less rainfall during the summer months after veraison.|$|E
25|$|While the BLM rates horses by {{animal unit}} (AUM) {{to eat the}} same amount of forage as a cow-calf pair, 1.0, {{multiple}} studies of horse grazing patterns indicate that horses probably consume forage at a rate closer to 1.5 AUM. Modern rangeland management also recommends removing all livestock <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season</b> to maximize recovery of the forage. Allowing livestock to graze year-round is not good for the range, and so mismanagement of feral herds can also degrade the range for the wildlife that shares the same area.|$|E
25|$|Carignan is a late budding {{and late}} {{ripening}} variety {{that is often}} {{one of the last}} grapes to be harvested during a vintage. The vine is very vigorous and high yielding, able to easily produce 200 hectoliters/hectare (approximately 10.4 tons/acres), if not kept in check by winter pruning or green harvesting <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> <b>season.</b> The late ripening nature of the grape means that it rarely achieves full ripeness unless planted in vineyard soils in very warm climates such as the Mediterranean climates where the grape originated in or the hot Central Valley of California.|$|E
