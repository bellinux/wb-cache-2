2500|$|Solder ( [...] , [...] or in North America [...] ) is a <b>fusible</b> <b>metal</b> alloy used {{to create}} a {{permanent}} bond between metal workpieces. The word solder comes from the Middle English word soudur, via Old French solduree and soulder, from the Latin solidare, meaning [...] "to make solid". In fact, solder must be melted in order to adhere to and connect the pieces together, so a suitable alloy for use as solder will have a lower melting point than the pieces it is intended to join. Whenever possible, the solder should also be resistant to oxidative and corrosive effects that would degrade the joint over time. Solder that is intended for use in making electrical connections between electronic components also usually has favorable electrical characteristics.|$|E
60|$|It {{is strange}} that this metal {{is almost always}} found {{associated}} with some four or five other metals, most curious in their qualities and characteristics. They are called platiniferous metals; {{and they have not}} only the relation of being always found associated in this manner, but they have other relations of a curious nature, which I shall point out to you by a reference to one of the tables behind me. This substance is always native--it is always in the metallic state; and the metals with which it is found connected, and which are rarely found elsewhere, are palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium, and ruthenium. We have the names in one of the tables arranged in two columns, representing, as you see, two groups--platinum, iridium, and osmium constituting one group; and ruthenium, rhodium, and palladium the other. Three of these have the chemical equivalent of 98-1/2, and the others a chemical equivalent of about half that number. Then the metals of one group have an extreme specific gravity--platinum being, in fact, the lightest of the three, or as light as the lightest. Osmium has a specific gravity of 21.4, and is the heaviest body in nature; platinum is 21.15, and iridium the same; the specific gravity of the other three being only about half that, namely, 11.3, 12.1, and 11.8. Then there is this curious relation, that palladium and iridium are very much alike, so that you would scarcely know one from the other, though one has only half the weight of the other, and only half the equivalent power. So with iridium and rhodium, and osmium and ruthenium, which are so closely allied that they make pairs, being separated each from its own group. Then these metals are the most infusible that we possess. Osmium is the most difficult to fuse: indeed, I believe it never has been fused, while every other metal has. Ruthenium comes next, iridium next, rhodium next, platinum next (so that it ranks here as a pretty <b>fusible</b> <b>metal,</b> and yet we have been long accustomed to speak of the infusibility of platinum), and next comes palladium, which is the most <b>fusible</b> <b>metal</b> of the whole. It is a curious thing to see this fine association of physical properties coming out in metals which are grouped together somehow or other in nature, but, no doubt, by causes which are related to analogous properties in their situation {{on the surface of the}} earth, for it is in alluvial soils that these things are found.|$|E
50|$|Such alloys {{are used}} for making the fusible plugs {{inserted}} in the furnace crowns of steam boilers, as a safeguard {{in the event of}} the water level being allowed to fall too low. When this happens the plug, being no longer covered with water, is heated to such a temperature that it melts and allows the contents of the boiler to escape into the furnace. In automatic fire sprinklers the orifices of each sprinkler is closed with a plug that is held in place by <b>fusible</b> <b>metal,</b> which melts and liberates the water when, owing to an outbreak of fire in the room, the temperature rises above a predetermined limit.|$|E

Heat transfer intensification methods are based on applying heat conductive pastes and <b>fusible</b> <b>metals.</b> Artificial air gaps are used for the reduction of heat transfer in the mould. Aluminium, copper, bronze, and graphite powders with silicon organic binders are most suitable for the pastes production. Pastes enabled to increase productivity by 10 - 15 %.

50|$|The Clifford {{also has}} a double shield, but with a plain flat top. The chimney is quite narrow with gauze {{covering}} the top. The bottom of the chimney has a glass bell covering the flame. The chimney is supported on a gauze shelf. Air enters through {{the lower part of}} the outer shield, through the passage and into the lamp through the inner shield. It is drawn down through the gauze then passes the flame and ascends the chimney. At the top it leaves through gauze and the top of the double shield. The inner chimney is made of copper coated with a <b>fusible</b> <b>metal.</b> If the lamp gets too hot the metal melts and closes up the air holes, extinguishing the lamp.|$|E

The HFTL has one moving part which is restrained in the latched position by a low melting temperature or <b>fusible</b> <b>metal</b> alloy. When heated the fusible alloy flows to a receiving chamber {{and in so doing}} at first releases the tension load in the latch bolt and later releases the bolt itself.

The paper {{purpose is to}} study the thermodynamic properties {{and the state of}} scandium in the chloride melts and in the alloys with the <b>fusible</b> <b>metals.</b> The simulators, which allow to systematize and to explain the scandium properties, the properties of rare-earth metals and of some actinoides in the chloride melts and in number of metallic alloys, have been developed. The obtained data about the thermo-chemical properties of scandium in the different media are the substantial additions to the literary data; they may be the rigorous thermodynamic basis for the development of electro-chemical processes of scandium production.

6000|$|In {{the year}} 1861 Barr Lassiter, {{a young man}} of twenty-two, lived with his parents and an elder sister near Carthage, Tennessee. The family were in {{somewhat}} humble circumstances, subsisting by cultivation of a small and not very fertile plantation. Owning no slaves, they were not rated among [...] "the best people" [...] of their neighborhood; but they were honest persons of good education, fairly well mannered and as respectable as any family could be if uncredentialed by personal dominion over {{the sons and daughters}} of Ham. The elder Lassiter had that severity of manner that so frequently affirms an uncompromising devotion to duty, and conceals a warm and affectionate disposition. He was of the iron of which martyrs are made, but in the heart of the matrix had lurked a nobler <b>metal,</b> <b>fusible</b> at a milder heat, yet never coloring nor softening the hard exterior. By both heredity and environment something of the man's inflexible character had touched the other members of the family; the Lassiter home, though not devoid of domestic affection, was a veritable citadel of duty, and duty--ah, duty is as cruel as death! ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{formation}} of a surface layer of diffused TiNiCo {{was carried out by}} metallization of <b>fusible</b> <b>metal</b> melt under isothermal conditions in an argon atmosphere at a temperature of 1100 – 1150 °C. The driving force of the process is the difference in concentration of alloying elements {{on the surface of the}} workpiece melt. A melt of lead or eutectic Pb-Bi was used as a transport medium, whose elements are in saturated atomic state and in direct contact with the surface of workpieces. This molten surface-activated product was purified from oxide films, providing a high wettability, which in turn provides good adhesion. Dissolved melt powders of Ti, Ni, and Co were first adsorbed on the surface of the items and then diffused into the surface of the volume. The cementation process was carried out cyclically by lifting the melt products every 25 – 30 minutes. The duration of the saturation process was 11 – 13 hours, depending on the desired coating thickness...|$|E
40|$|A {{trial was}} made by the author for making a {{transparent}} model of the cerebral ventricular system and basal ganglia. Paraffine-wax was introduced in the ventricular system of the cadarer for the ventricular cast. The mould of the basal ganglia was made from the serial section of the brain with the resin. Then the combination of the paraffine-wax cast of the ventricles and the resin mould of the basal ganglia was embedded in the transparent methylmetacrylate plastics, after making a membrane of polyvinyl-alcohol {{on the surface of the}} combination. Hitherto, technical difficulties have been appointed to make a block of acrylic resin over 3 cm thickness. The auther maid a block of plastics of 15 cm thickness by "repeat-pouring" method. The most important care should be taken for preventing vesicle-formation in the plastics. For making a hollow model of the ventricles Melotte' <b>fusible</b> <b>metal</b> is better than wax.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of ChemistryTakashi ItoSelf-organized {{nanoporous}} {{materials have}} drawn {{a lot of}} attention because the uniform, highly dense, and ordered cylindrical nanopores in these materials provide a unique platform for chemical separations and chemical sensing applications. Here, we explore self-organized nanopores of PS-b-PMMA diblock copolymer thin films and anodic gallium oxide for chemical separations and sensing applications. In the first study, cyclic voltammograms of cytochrome c on recessed nanodisk-array electrodes (RNEs) based on nanoporous films (11, 14 or 24 nm in average pore diameter; 30 nm thick) derived from polystyrene-poly(methylmethacrylate) diblock copolymers were measured. The faradic current of cytochrome c was observed on RNEs, indicating the penetration of cytochrome c (hydrodynamic diameter ≈ 4 nm) through the nanopores to the underlying electrodes. Compared to the 24 -nm pores, the diffusion of cytochrome c molecules through the 11 - and 14 -nm pores suffered significantly larger hindrance. The results reported in this study will provide guidance in designing RNEs for size-based chemical sensing and also for controlled immobilization of biomolecules within nanoporous media for biosensors and bioreactors. In another study, conditions for the formation of self-organized nanopores of a metal oxide film were investigated. Self-organized nanopores aligned perpendicular to the film surface were obtained upon anodization of gallium films in ice-cooled 4 and 6 M aqueous H 2 SO 4 at 10 V and 15 V. The average pore diameter was in the range of 18 ~ 40 nm, and the anodic gallium oxide was ca. 2 µm thick. In addition, anodic formation of self-organized nanopores was demonstrated for a solid gallium monolith incorporated {{at the end of a}} glass capillary. Nanoporous anodic oxide monoliths formed from a <b>fusible</b> <b>metal</b> will lead to future development of unique devices for chemical sensing and catalysis. In the final study, surface chemical property of self-organized nanoporous anodic gallium oxide is explored through potentiometric measurements. The nanoporous anodic and barrier layer gallium oxide structures showed slow potentiometric response only at acidic pH (≤ 4), in contrast to metallic gallium substrates that exhibited a positive potentiometric response to H⁺ over the pH range examined (3 - 10). The potentiometric response at acidic pH probably reflects some chemical processes between gallium oxide and HCl...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is the use of}} pinhole collimation in Nuclear Medicine. A pinhole is a single aperture in an opaque material that is placed between the detector and source of interest, and photons must pass through the hole to reach the detector. The choices of pinhole parameters, e. g. the pinhole material and size of the opening, are closely linked to the performance of the detector system. Pinhole-based single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has primarily been used to investigate human diseases in small animals because of the superior resolution and efficiency achieved with this type of collimation. The SPECT methodology involves determination of the radiopharmaceutical distribution within an object. An essential step in this methodology is the image reconstruction, i. e., the transformation of the acquired two-dimensional (2 D) data into a three-dimensional (3 D) distribution. This dissertation describes the development of a SPECT system for small animal imaging called InSPECT. In Paper I, determination of the reconstructed resolution for a prototype setup with a video-based detector system is discussed, and in Paper II, construction of the InSPECT system with eight separate video detectors is described. A <b>fusible</b> <b>metal,</b> Rose’s metal, was used to cast the centre bore, in which platinum pinholes were mounted. The cast pieces could adequately shield the detectors and could be machined with a high precision. Thus, Rose’s metal, which is relatively inexpensive, could be employed for pinhole collimation but would lead to image characteristics that are less favourable than those achievable using gold or platinum pinholes. In Paper III, we present an evaluation of the performance of Rose’s metal pinholes and a comparison with other pinhole materials. Monte Carlo-based computer models can be utilised to simulate the image formation process and can enable expensive and time-consuming instrumentation changes to be evaluated prior to building prototypes. In Paper IV, we discuss the implementation of a cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) semiconductor detector model in the Monte Carlo program SIMIND. The accuracy of the model was confirmed by comparing its results to measurements. In Paper V, we address the use of the CZT model in an SIMIND-based maximum-likelihood–expectation-maximisation iterative reconstruction of the measured data. The images reconstructed using the computer model enabled the quantification of the total activity without requiring calibration of the detector count per unit second per unit activity. In Paper VI, we describe the simulation of a dedicated SPECT scanner that employs 19 semiconductor detector–pinhole units for myocardial perfusion imaging. Compared to conventional SPECT devices, this camera is more efficient, and the efficiency is often traded for a reduction in imaging times and patient doses. An alternative use of the efficiency is to use smaller pinhole which yields better spatial resolution in the projections. No increase in contrast-to-noise was seen for smaller pinholes since any increase in contrast was also accompanied by an equal increase in noise. Also, changes in transmurality affected the CNR {{to a greater extent than}} did changes in lesion extent...|$|E
