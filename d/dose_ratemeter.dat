40|$|Radiation {{dose rate}} in the gamma camera {{workplace}} were measured during brain scanning procedures using a dose of 15 - 20 mCi 99 mTc-pertechnetate (99 mTcO 4 -) given intravenously to each patient. The study based on randomly selected 20 patients duly registered for brain scan at Centre for Nuclear Medicine & Ultrasound (CNMU), Rajshahi. Radiation dose rate at the patient-handling place and computer-operating place were measured by a high sensitive portable <b>dose</b> <b>ratemeter</b> and a NaI detector. Brain imaging procedures were usually done two hours post injection. Radiation dose rate at the patient-handling place found to be 20 ± 4 µSvhr- 1 and the computer-operating place were 2 ± 0. 4 µSvhr- 1. Patient skull surface doses were measured also and found to be 120 ± 24 µSvhr- 1 (one hour post injection) and 80 ± 13 µSvhr- 1 (two hours post injection). The {{results showed that the}} radiation dose {{rate in the}} gamma camera workplace during brain scanning procedures found to be nearly 6 to 60 times higher than the background level. The research goals of the study were to measure the workplace radiation level during brain scanning procedures and sketched some special remedial measures to reduce the radiation exposure rate in the gamma camera work environment...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: At the High Flux Reactor (HFR), Petten in The Netherlands, EORTC {{clinical}} trials of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) {{have been in}} progress since 1997. BNCT involves the irradiation of cancer patients by a beam of neutrons, with an energy range of predominantly 1 eV to 10 keV. The patient is infused with a tumour-seeking, 10 B-loaded compound prior to irradiation. Neutron capture in the 10 B atoms results in a high local radiation dose to the tumour cells, whilst sparing the healthy tissue. Neutron capture however also occurs in other atoms naturally present in tissue, sometimes resulting in radionuclides that will be present after treatment. The patient is therefore, following BNCT, radioactive. The importance of this induced activity {{with respect to the}} absorbed dose in the patient {{as well as to the}} radiation exposure of the staff has been investigated. Material and Methods: As a standard radiation protection procedure, the ambient dose equivalent rate was measured on all patients following BNCT using a <b>dose</b> <b>ratemeter.</b> Furthermore, some of the patients underwent measurements using a gamma-ray spectrometer to identify which elements and confirm which isotopes are activated. Results: Peak levels, i. e. at contact and directly after radiation, are of the order of 40 - 60 Sv/h, falling to less than 10 Sv/h 30 - 50 minutes after treatment. The average ambient dose equivalent in the first 2 hours at a distance of 2 m from our patients is in the order of 2. 5 Sv. The ambient dose equivalent rate in 2 m distance from the patients head at the earliest time of leaving the reactor centre (20 minutes after the end of treatment) is far less than 1 µSv/h. The main radioisotopes were identified as 38 Cl, 49 Ca and 24 Na. Furthermore, in two patients, the isotopes 198 Au and 116 mIn were also present. The initial activity is predominantly due to 49 Ca, whilst the remaining activity is predominantly due to 24 Na. Conclusions: The absorbed dose resulting from the activated isotopes in the irradiated volume is in the order of less then 1 % of the prescribed dose and therefore does not add a significant contribution to the absorbed dose in the target volume. In other parts of the patient’s body, the absorbed dose by induced activity is magnitudes smaller and can be neglected. The levels of radiation received by staff members and non-radiation workers (i. e. accompanying persons) are well below the recommended limitsJRC. F. 3 -High Flux and Future Reactor...|$|E

Radiation protection monitoring instruments should be calibrated in terms of dose equivalent quantities.
