Probenecid 500 mg b. d. was co-administered throughout the entire study period in the treatment phase of the study. The steady state plasma concentration of <b>diflunisal</b> was significantly higher during the probenecid treatment phase {{as compared to the}} control phase (104. 0 vs. 63. 1 micrograms. ml- 1).

The metabolite formation clearance of the sulphate conjugate was not affected by probenecid coadministration. Steady state plasma concentrations of the sulphate and glucuronide conjugates of <b>diflunisal</b> were 2. 5 - to 3. 1 -fold higher during probenecid co-administration, due to a significant reduction in the renal clearance of the three <b>diflunisal</b> conjugates.

40|$|Single dose {{pharmacokinetics}} of oxazepam, 30 mg, {{have been}} studied in six healthy male volunteers {{in the absence of}} <b>diflunisal</b> and during continuous treatment with <b>diflunisal</b> 500 mg twice daily.

The AUC of oxazepam glucuronide significantly increased from 4771 +/- 227 ng ml- 1 h to 8116 +/- 644 ng ml- 1 h and its elimination half-life increased from 10. 0 +/- 0. 6 h to 13. 0 +/- 1. 0 h. Renal clearance for oxazepam glucuronide was significantly reduced from 74 +/- 2 ml min- 1 to 46 +/- 3 ml min- 1.

Special emphasis is placed on the research of co-crystals and on the influence of structural changes in the pyridinecarboxamide co-former molecules for co-crystal formation with <b>diflunisal.</b> The thermodynamics based methodology described by ter Horst et al. in 2010 indicates that the formation of co-crystals is thermodynamically feasible for both systems.

Two binary eutectic mixtures, potentially relevant for pharmaceutical application, were also identified. Infrared spectroscopy allowed the identification of the acid⋯N-pyridine heterosynthon in the three co-crystals formed by <b>diflunisal</b> with the isomeric pyridinecarboxamides.

40|$|In {{familial}} amyloidotic polyneuropathy, TTR (transthyretin) variants are deposited as amyloid fibrils. It {{is thought}} that this process involves TTR tetramer dissociation, which leads to partially unfolded monomers that aggregate and polymerize into amyloid fibrils. This process can be counteracted by stabilization of the tetramer. Several small compounds, such as diclofenac, <b>diflunisal</b> and flufenamic acid, {{have been reported to}} bind to TTR in vitro, in the T 4 (thyroxine) binding channel that runs through the TTR tetramer, and consequently are considered to stabilize TTR. However, if these agents bind plasma proteins other than TTR, decreased drug availability will occur, compromising their use as therapeutic agents for TTR amyloidosis. In the present work, we compared the action of these compounds and of new derivatives designed to increase both selectivity of binding to TTR and inhibitory potency in relation to TTR amyloid fibril formation. We found two <b>diflunisal</b> derivatives that, in contrast with diclofenac, flufenamic acid and <b>diflunisal,</b> displaced T 4 from TTR in plasma preferentially over binding to albumin and thyroxine binding globulin. The same <b>diflunisal</b> derivatives also had a stabilizing effect on TTR tetramers in plasma, as studied by isoelectric focusing of whole plasma under semi-denaturing conditions. In addition, by transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrated that, in contrast with other proposed TTR stabilizers (namely diclofenac, flufenamic acid and <b>diflunisal),</b> one of the <b>diflunisal</b> derivatives tested efficiently inhibited TTR aggregation. Taken together, our ex vivo and in vitro studies present evidence for the selectivity and efficiency of novel <b>diflunisal</b> derivates as TTR stabilizers and as inhibitors of fibril formation...|$|E

Metabolic ratios, on the other hand, correlated positively and tended to localize variability within a single enzyme pathway. Thus, females using estrogen-containing oral contraceptives were shown to excrete 50 % less DS and 20 % more DAG than non-users, and recoveries of DS were reduced by about 30 % in cigarette smokers. Kernel density analyses of the log metabolic ratios of DS and DPG were broad-based and unimodal. However, kernel density estimates {{of the distribution of}} log metabolic ratios of DAG showed 3 peaks, 1 of which (an extensive metabolizer polymorph) could be removed by excluding contraceptive-using females. Similarly, there were 2 poor metabolizer peaks in the distribution of log metabolic ratios of DS attributable to cigarette smoking and, in females, use of an oral contraceptive. Thus, we conclude that the metabolism of <b>diflunisal</b> is altered by cigarette smoking and oral contraceptives, and that kernel density estimation, as applied to log metabolic ratios, is a sensitive and specific method for detection of polymorphic variation in drug metabolism...|$|E
40|$|The motor protein prestin is {{a member}} of the SLC 26 family of anion antiporters and is {{essential}} to the electromotility of cochlear outer hair cells and for hearing. The only direct inhibitor of electromotility and the associated charge transfer is salicylate, possibly through direct interaction with an anion-binding site on prestin. In a screen to identify other inhibitors of prestin activity, we explored the effect of the non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug <b>diflunisal,</b> which is a derivative of salicylate. We recorded prestin activity by whole-cell patch clamping HEK cells transiently expressing prestin and mouse outer hair cells. We monitored the impact of <b>diflunisal</b> on the prestin-dependent non-linear capacitance and electromotility. We found that <b>diflunisal</b> triggers two prestin-associated effects: a chloride independent increase in the surface area and the specific capacitance of the membrane, and a chloride dependent inhibition of the charge transfer and the electromotility in outer hair cells. We conclude that <b>diflunisal</b> affects the cell membrane organization and inhibits prestin-associated charge transfer and electromotility at physiological chloride concentrations.

40|$|The role of {{beta-glucuronidase}} catalyzed hydrolysis of glucuronides on the in vivo disposition kinetics of xenobiotics was {{studied in}} the rat. The metabolic disposition kinetics of <b>diflunisal,</b> a compound undergoing transformation to an acyl and phenyl glucuronide, were studied in rats under control conditions and following administration of D-glucaro- 1, 4 -lactone, a potent and specific beta-glucuronidase inhibitor. D-glucaro- 1, 4 -lactone treatment resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} beta-glucuronidase activity in plasma, urine, and hepatic microsomes. Total (i. e. urinary and biliary) recovery of the acyl glucuronide following i. v. injection of <b>diflunisal</b> (10 mg/kg) was significantly higher in D-glucaro- 1, 4 -lactone treated rats (41 +/- 3 %, n= 6) compared to control rats (29 +/- 2 %, n= 6) whereas for <b>diflunisal</b> phenyl glucuronide this total recovery was very similar in both groups of rats (16. 0 +/- 1. 0 % vs. 18. 0 +/- 0. 2 %, n= 6, respectively). The partial clearance of <b>diflunisal</b> associated with the formation of the acyl glucuronide was significantly higher in D-glucaro- 1, 4 -lactone treated rats (0. 413 +/- 0. 024 ml/min/kg) compared to control animals (0. 269 +/- 0. 042 ml/min/kg). The partial clearance related to the formation of the phenyl glucuronide, on the contrary, was not significantly affected by D-glucaro- 1, 4 -lactone treatment. These results shows that the in vivo glucuronidation of <b>diflunisal</b> to the acyl glucuronide, unlike <b>diflunisal</b> glucuronidation to the phenyl glucuronide, is subject to a futile conjugation-deconjugation cycle.

40|$|The {{controlled}} release of <b>diflunisal</b> and fluconazole from tablets made of novel polymers, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) crosslinked with either beta-cyclodextrin (beta CD) or hydroxypropyl-beta CD (HP beta CD), was investigated and Carbopol 934 P (Carbopol) {{was used as}} a highly crosslinked PAA for comparison. <b>Diflunisal</b> strongly associates with beta CD-PAA and HP beta CD-PAA polymers (K-a of 486 and 6, 055 M- 1 respectively); thus, it was physically mixed into the conjugates and also precomplexed to identify whether decomplexation has any influence on release kinetics. Fluconazole has poor complexing ability (K-a of 34 M- 1 with HP beta CD-PAA); thus, it was only tested as a physical mixture. Swelling and adhesion studies were conducted on all tablet combinations and adhesivity of the CD-PAA polymer tablets was maintained. <b>Diflunisal</b> release was much slower from HP beta CD-PAA tablets than from beta CD-PAA, suggesting that a higher degree of complexation retards release. The precomplexed <b>diflunisal</b> release was also slower than the physically mixed <b>diflunisal</b> of the corresponding conjugate. The release closely followed zero-order kinetics for HP beta CD-PAA, but was more sigmoidal for beta CD-PAA and especially Carbopol. Conversely, poorly associating fluconazole released in almost exactly the same way across both polymers and Carbopol, indicating that the release kinetics of poorly associating drugs are not influenced by the presence of cyclodextrins. In view of the varying profiles and release rates shown with <b>diflunisal</b> for the different polymers, the fluconazole data support the concept that adequate complexation can indeed modulate the release kinetics of drugs...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Diflunisal</b> is a long-acting non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) {{most commonly}} used to treat acute postoperative pain or chronic joint pain from osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. This review analyses the effectiveness and harm of different doses of <b>diflunisal</b> {{in the context of}} moderate to severe postoperative pain. OBJECTIVES: To assess efficacy, duration of action, and associated adverse events of single dose oral <b>diflunisal</b> in acute postoperative pain in adults. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief Database for studies to January 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trials of single dose orally administered <b>diflunisal</b> in adults with moderate to severe acute postoperative pain. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Pain relief or pain intensity data were extracted and converted into the dichotomous outcome of number of participants with at least 50 % pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, from which relative risk and number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT) were calculated. Numbers of participants using rescue medication over specified time periods, and time to use of rescue medication, were sought as additional measures of efficacy. Information on adverse events and withdrawals were collected. MAIN RESULTS: Nine studies in dental, orthopedic and gynaecological surgery met the inclusion criteria, testing doses of <b>diflunisal</b> from 125 mg to 1000 mg. For <b>diflunisal</b> 1000 mg, the NNT for at least 50 % pain relief over 4 to 6 hours was 2. 1 (1. 8 to 2. 6) (6 studies, 391 participants); the NNT to prevent remedication within 6 hours was 1. 9 (1. 7 to 2. 3), and within 12 hours was 2. 2 (1. 9 to 2. 7) (6 studies, 409 participants). More participants experienced adverse events with <b>diflunisal</b> 100 mg than with placebo, but none were serious or led to withdrawal. For <b>diflunisal</b> 500 mg, the NNT for at least 50 % pain relief over 4 to 6 hours was 2. 6 (2. 1 to 3. 3) (6 studies, 357 participants); the NNT to prevent remedication within 6 hours was 2. 6 (2. 1 to 3. 4) (6 studies, 390 participants), and within 12 hours was 2. 9 (2. 3 to 4. 0) (5 studies, 329 participants). Adverse events did not differ significantly from placebo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: <b>Diflunisal</b> has an analgesic effect similar to other NSAIDs in single dose, but benefits from providing significant analgesia for about twelve hours. This property may be useful when regular dosing is needed, or when taking several doses of a shorter acting analgesic is impractical...|$|E
40|$|In a {{double-blind}} crossover study, {{the effect}} on postoperative pain of lidocaine plus <b>diflunisal</b> was {{compared with that of}} bupivacaine and placebo. Forty-eight patients with bilateral impactions of lower third molars had these removed on two occasions four weeks apart. One pain-control regimen was used on one occasion and the alternate on the second. The pain intensity was indicated on a visual analog scale at 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours postoperatively. The pain values for the first postoperative hours were higher for the lidocaine <b>diflunisal</b> combination, whereas after 5 hours the opposite was true. Significantly more patients preferred the combination of lidocaine and <b>diflunisal.</b> Three patients reported fatigue postoperatively during the day of surgery, which they attributed to the operation and not to the analgesics used...|$|E
40|$|Crystal habit {{modification}} of the drug <b>diflunisal</b> that normally grows into extremely thin, long needles has been achieved by breaking the stacking effect {{with the help of}} coformers. Eight new cocrystals are reported, along with three crystal structures. In all cases, ortho F disorder, often a feature in <b>diflunisal</b> structures was absent due to the presence of CH F interactions. Co-milling <b>diflunisal</b> with oxalic acid produced 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 cocrystals. In contrast, in solution crystallization, oxalic acid played the role of an additive resulting in the crystallization of <b>diflunisal</b> form I rather than form III. To rationalize cocrystal formation, a statistical analysis of the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre database for aromatic o-hydroxy carboxylic acids was carried out. All cocrystals of o-hydroxy carboxylic acids with the COOH dimer motif have an electron withdrawing group on one of the acids. COOH center dot center dot center dot N-ar motifs are formed preferentially over carboxylic homodimers in the presence of an N-ar coformer.
