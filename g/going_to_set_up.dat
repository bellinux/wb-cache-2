60|$|Dolby {{came back}} from another run to New York, this morning. The {{receipts}} are very large indeed, far exceeding our careful estimate made at Gad's. I think you had best in future (unless I give you intimation to the contrary) address your letters to me, at the Westminster Hotel, Irving Place, New York City. It is a more central position than this, and {{we are likely to}} be much more there than here. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> a brougham in New York, and keep my rooms at that hotel. The account of Matilda is a very melancholy one, and really distresses me. What she must sink into, it is sad to consider. However, there was nothing for it but to send her away, that is quite clear.|$|E
60|$|Mrs John Rokesmith sat at {{needlework}} in her {{neat little}} room, beside {{a basket of}} neat little articles of clothing, which presented {{so much of the}} appearance of being in the dolls' dressmaker's way of business, that one might have supposed she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> in opposition to Miss Wren. Whether the Complete British Family Housewife had imparted sage counsel anent them, did not appear, but probably not, as that cloudy oracle was nowhere visible. For certain, however, Mrs John Rokesmith stitched at them with so dexterous a hand, that she must have taken lessons of somebody. Love is in all things a most wonderful teacher, and perhaps love (from a pictorial point of view, with nothing on but a thimble), had been teaching this branch of needlework to Mrs John Rokesmith.|$|E

There are two houses for sale about a mile down the road, and we don't know any reason why people should want to go away except it's the bear. Nearly all the dogs around here are kept chained up for fear that Orso will get hold of them, and there is a general commotion, I can tell you. At first it was great fun, but it is getting a little tiresome now. We have been talking about shooting him, and then I shall have his bones, which I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> as a skeleton, and it is my opinion that you ought to have the skin." ...|$|E
60|$|His morbid shyness of {{his child}} {{had given way}} to genuine affection, and Owen soon found that he liked to be left to the society of Flibbertigibbet, or as he called him for short, Giblets, {{exacting}} in return the title of father, instead of the terrible 'pa.' Little Owen thought this a preparation for the itinerant white-mouse exhibition, which he was permitted to believe was only delayed till the daily gymnastic exertions should have resulted in the use of crutches, and till he could safely pronounce the names of the future mice, Hannibal and Annabella, and other traps for aspirates! Nay, his father was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> an exhibition of his own, as it appeared; for after a vast amount of meditation, he begged for pen and paper, ruler and compasses, drew, wrote, and figured, and finally took to cardboard and penknife, begging the aid of Miss Charlecote, greatly to the distress of the little boy, who had thought the whole affair private and confidential, and looked forward to a secret departure early in the morning, with crutches, mice, and model.|$|E
60|$|Frank was {{disappointed}} indeed upon landing. Sierra Leone {{had given him}} an exalted idea of African civilization, but this was at once dispelled {{by the appearance of}} Bonny. The houses were constructed entirely of black mud, and the streets were narrow and filthy beyond description. The palace was composed of two or three hovels, surrounded by a mud wall. In one of these huts the king was seated. Mr. Goodenough and Frank were introduced by the agent, who had gone ashore with them, and His Majesty, who was an almost naked negro, at once invited them to join him in the meal of which he was partaking. As a matter of courtesy they consented, and plates were placed before them, heaped with a stew consisting of meat, vegetables, and hot peppers. While the meal went on the king asked Mr. Goodenough what he had come to the coast for, and {{was disappointed}} to find that he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> as a trader at Bonny, as it was the custom for each newcomer to make a handsome present to him.

40|$|The {{increasing}} need in {{techniques of}} storing big data presents a new challenge. One {{way to address}} this challenge {{is the use of}} distributed storage systems. One strategy that implemented in distributed data storage systems is the use of Erasure Code which applied to network coding.

Some studies have also been carried out to create code that is based on other algebraic structures such as module.  In this study, we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> a code based on the algebraic structure which is a generalization of the module that is semimodule by utilizing the max operations and sum operations at max plus algebra.
