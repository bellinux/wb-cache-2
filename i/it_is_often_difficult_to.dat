While <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> determine who was considered most important on a charter's witness list, placement {{near the top of}} the list is usually understood to mean that the signatory was considered important. Almost always during the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais is listed right below the royal family and the archbishops.|$|E
5|$|For {{the human}} ear, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> tell {{precisely}} where a cicada song originates. The pitch is nearly constant, {{the sound is}} continuous to the human ear, and cicadas sing in scattered groups. In addition to the mating song, many species have a distinct distress call, usually a broken and erratic sound emitted by the insect when seized or panicked. Some species also have courtship songs, generally quieter, and produced after a female has been drawn to the calling song. Males also produce encounter calls, whether in courtship or to maintain personal space within choruses.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> superficially {{distinguish}} {{between male and}} female bigfin reef squids. Some authors say that females are generally smaller than males, but this distinction is not observed in other studies. Closer examination of sexually mature specimens, however, will usually distinguish males from females by the presence of the hectocotylus on the fourth left arm in males, and the nidamental glands and the pale ovaries within the mantle in females. Males also purportedly show a more conspicuous pattern of transverse streaks on their dorsal side.|$|E
5|$|Survivals {{from late}} Medieval church {{fittings}} and objects in Scotland are exceptionally rare even {{compared to those}} from comparable areas like England or Norway, probably because of the thoroughness of their destruction in the Scottish Reformation. The Scottish elite and church now participated in a culture stretching across Europe, and many objects that do survive are imported, such as Limoges enamels. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> decide the country of creation of others, as work in international styles was produced in Scotland, along with pieces retaining more distinctive local styles.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, {{the spotted}} hyena is usually portrayed as an {{abnormal}} and ambivalent animal, {{considered to be}} sly, brutish, necrophagous and dangerous. It further embodies physical power, excessivity, ugliness, stupidity, as well as sacredness. Spotted hyenas vary in their folkloric and mythological depictions, depending on the ethnic group from which the tales originate. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{know whether or not}} spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names. In west African tales, spotted hyenas symbolise immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits, and are sometimes depicted as bad Muslims who challenge the local animism that exists among the Beng in Côte d’Ivoire. In East Africa, Tabwa mythology portrays the spotted hyena as a solar animal that first brought the sun to warm the cold earth.|$|E

25|$|Note: Because Ives {{often made}} several {{different}} versions of the same piece, and because his work was generally ignored during his life, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> put exact dates on his compositions. The dates given here are sometimes best guesses. There have also been controversial speculations that he purposely misdated his own pieces earlier or later than actually written.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{high-level}} programming languages, such as Java, make debugging easier, {{because they}} have features such as exception handling and type checking that make real sources of erratic behaviour easier to spot. In programming languages such as C or assembly, bugs may cause silent problems such as memory corruption, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> see where the initial problem happened. In those cases, memory debugger tools may be needed.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{decide where}} to draw the {{boundary}} between a language and a dialect, causing some minor disagreement among scholars regarding the inventory of Formosan languages.

25|$|A graph drawing {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the graph itself (the abstract, non-visual structure) as there are several ways to structure the graph drawing. All that matters is which vertices are connected to which others by how many edges and not the exact layout.

Depending on the problem domain some layouts may be better suited and easier to understand than others.|$|E
25|$|No AMM {{performance}} is ever planned; each {{is unique and}} spontaneous. The musicians vowed never to rehearse and never to discuss what they had played. The musicians tend to avoid any conventional melody, harmony or rhythm, and seek out an ensemble sound that often obscures any individual's role. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> discern which musical instrument is making which specific sound on an AMM recording, {{due in part to}} liberal use of various extended techniques on their instruments.|$|E

As the growth of cities increased, the demand for slaves across the region of West Africa also increased. The historical pattern has included the murder of indigenous males by Islamic raiders and enslavement of women and children.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{a primary}} X-ray beam to excite {{fluorescent}} radiation from the sample was first proposed by Glocker and Schreiber in 1928. Today, the method {{is used as a}} non-destructive analytical technique, and as a process control tool in many extractive and processing industries. In principle, the lightest element that can be analysed is beryllium (Z = 4), but due to instrumental limitations and low X-ray yields for the light elements, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> quantify elements lighter than sodium (Z = 11), unless background corrections and very comprehensive inter-element corrections are made.|$|E
25|$|However, {{cognitive}} science and psychology {{do not require}} the mind to be irreducible, and operate {{on the assumption that}} it has physical basis. In fact, it is common in science to presuppose a complex system; while fields such as chemistry, biology, or geology could be verbosely expressed in terms of quantum field theory, it is convenient to use levels of abstraction like molecules, cells, or the mantle. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> decompose these levels without heavy analysis and computation.
