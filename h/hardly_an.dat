25|$|To {{put these}} figures into a {{personal}} perspective, when Mount Stephen died in 1921, after providing for his wife, step-daughter and charities, he left £1,414,319 {{to be divided}} between nineteen relatives, which worked out at about £75,000 each. Though <b>hardly</b> <b>an</b> inconsequential sum, he gave substantially more to charity than he left to his individual heirs.

25|$|One {{of those}} {{irregularities}} {{is related to}} juror No. 12. During the trial he violated his oath on several occasions and was referred to by Anand Jon’s lawyers as <b>hardly</b> <b>an</b> impartial juror. Although prohibited, juror No. 12 had discussed the case with his tenant and told her he felt the girls on the stand all {{seemed to have the}} same or similar stories, and that he was under the impression they had all collaborated. Due to his fellow jurors’ anger towards him, juror No. 12 felt he was pressured to give a verdict that he didn’t want to give. Also, during deliberations, several jurors complained to the judge that juror No. 12 was refusing to properly deliberate and had made up his mind about the evidence. Although the jury foreman had requested that juror No. 12 be removed for refusal to deliberate, it was denied by Judge Wesley.|$|E
25|$|Until 2001 the Italian state offered {{citizens}} {{living abroad}} a free return train journey {{to their home}} town in Italy in order to vote, however {{the portion of the}} train journey that was free of charge was only on Italian soil. Any costs incurred in getting from their place of residence abroad to the Italian border had to be covered by the citizen wanting to vote, therefore a free return train journey was <b>hardly</b> <b>an</b> incentive for the large Italian communities living as far away as in the United States, Argentina or Australia. For this reason very few Italians abroad made use of this right to vote, unless they lived in cities and towns that bordered to Italy such as in Germany, Switzerland, France and Austria. Various Italian minorities living abroad (notably in the United States) protested frequently at this lack of political representation especially if they paid taxes on property owned in Italy.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from September 24, 1910. It states: [...] "Life in a country town is often tedious and tiresome, and {{were it not for}} the little dinners and teas the townsfolk are constantly given, existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed. So the time honored get-togethers of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar; they are just as much a matter of necessity and as such have come to stay. The Gales thought well of this established feature. They made it a joyous occasion for themselves as well as their guests. They were <b>hardly</b> <b>an</b> overly wealthy family, and their table was never notable for an oversupply of the good things of life, but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{hypothesis}} that plant {{growth and development}} is coordinated by plant hormones or plant growth regulators first emerged in the late 19th century. Darwin experimented on the movements of plant shoots and roots towards light and gravity, and concluded [...] "It is <b>hardly</b> <b>an</b> {{exaggeration to say that}} the tip of the radicle [...] [...] acts like the brain of one of the lower animals [...] [...] directing the several movements". About the same time, the role of auxins (from the Greek auxein, to grow) in control of plant growth was first outlined by the Dutch scientist Frits Went. The first known auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which promotes cell growth, was only isolated from plants about 50 years later. This compound mediates the tropic responses of shoots and roots towards light and gravity. The finding in 1939 that plant callus could be maintained in culture containing IAA, followed by the observation in 1947 that it could be induced to form roots and shoots by controlling the concentration of growth hormones were key steps in the development of plant biotechnology and genetic modification.|$|E

500|$|Getting It {{received}} mixed, {{but generally}} positive, reviews. [...] One positive evaluation came from psychiatrist James Charney, in a 1976 review for Library Journal. [...] Charney calls the book [...] "the only useful {{critical look at}} this essential issue", referring to the est training. [...] He notes in particular that Fenwick's [...] "analysis of {{the function of the}} group, the restrictive rules, and the enforced discomfort is convincing". In a 1977 review in Library Journal Edith Crockett and Ellis Mount highly recommended the book, commenting that [...] "A plethora of newspaper and magazine reports, along with books written by graduates... have attempted to explain the phenomenon of this self-help program, but none has done it as well or as objectively as this writer." [...] Kirkus Reviews noted the precedent set by the analytical nature of the book, writing [...] "Finally. Here's someone who is willing to disclose the details of Erhard Seminars Training, and then go on to analyze them from a psychological point of view." [...] Zane Berzins, writing for The New York Times Book Review in 1977, describes Fenwick's work as a [...] "calm and professionally informed view". [...] Berzins describes the book as a [...] "brave attempt" [...] at an analysis of est's appeal, and concludes that [...] "It's <b>hardly</b> <b>an</b> incendiary exposé, but Fenwick's open-minded scrutiny should deglamourize the est movement." ...|$|E
500|$|Beliefs about {{slow lorises}} {{and their use}} in {{traditional}} practices are deep-rooted and go back at least 300years, if not earlier based on oral traditions. [...] In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, {{it was reported that}} the people from the interior of Borneo believed that slow lorises were the gatekeepers for the heavens and that each person had a personal slow loris waiting for them in the afterlife. [...] More often, however, slow lorises are used in traditional medicine or to ward off evil. The following passage from an early textbook about primates is indicative of the superstitions associated with slow lorises: Many strange powers are attributed to this animal by the natives of the countries it inhabits; there is <b>hardly</b> <b>an</b> event in life to man, woman or child, or even domestic animals, that may not be influenced for better or worse by the Slow Loris, alive or dead, or by any separate part of it, and apparently one cannot usually tell at the time, that one is under supernatural power. Thus a Malay may commit a crime he did not premeditate, and then find that an enemy had buried a particular part of a Loris under his threshold, which had, unknown to him, compelled him to act to his own disadvantage. ... life is not a happy one, for it is continually seeing ghosts; that is why it hides its face in its hands.|$|E
500|$|Greater success {{came later}} in the year when Streep starred in the drama Sophie's Choice (also 1982), portraying a Polish {{holocaust}} survivor caught in a love triangle between a young naïve writer (Peter MacNicol) and a Jewish intellectual (Kevin Kline). Streep's emotional dramatic performance and her apparent mastery of a Polish accent drew praise. William Styron wrote the novel with Ursula Andress in mind for the role of Sophie, but Streep was determined to get the role. Streep filmed the [...] "choice" [...] scene in one take and refused to do it again, finding it extremely painful and emotionally exhausting. The scene in which Streep is ordered by an SS guard at Auschwitz to choose which one of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp, is her most famous scene, according to Emma Brockes of The Guardian who wrote in 2006: [...] "It's classic Streep, the kind of scene that makes your scalp tighten, but defter in a way is her handling of smaller, harder-to-grasp emotions". Among several acting awards, Streep won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance, and her characterization was voted the third greatest movie performance of all time by Premiere magazine. Roger Ebert said of her delivery, [...] "Streep plays the Brooklyn scenes with an enchanting Polish-American accent (she has the first accent I've ever wanted to hug), and she plays the flashbacks in subtitled German and Polish. There is <b>hardly</b> <b>an</b> emotion that Streep doesn't touch in this movie, and yet we're never aware of her straining. This {{is one of the most}} astonishing and yet one of the most unaffected and natural performances I can imagine." [...] Pauline Kael on the contrary called the film an [...] "infuriatingly bad movie" [...] and thought that Streep [...] "decorporealizes" [...] herself, which she believed explained why her movie heroines [...] "don't seem to be full characters, and why there are no incidental joys to be had from watching her".|$|E
