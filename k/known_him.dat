5|$|The casting {{director}} Roshmi Banerjee suggested Nawazuddin Siddiqui {{for the role}} of Khan. Siddiqui, who had only had minor roles in Bollywood up to that time, was surprised {{that for the first time}} he would not have to portray a beggar. Saswata Chatterjee, another Bengali actor, was surprised as well when he was offered the role of the contract killer Bob Biswas. He thought there were suitable actors in Hindi film industry for the role. He said that Ghosh had <b>known</b> <b>him</b> since childhood and was impressed with his acting, so he wanted him as Bob Biswas.|$|E
5|$|Using {{alternating}} first-person perspectives, {{the novel}} tells {{the stories of}} Henry DeTamble (born 1963), a librarian at the Newberry Library in Chicago, and his wife, Clare Anne Abshire (born 1971), an artist who makes paper sculptures. Henry has a rare genetic disorder, which comes {{to be known as}} Chrono-Impairment, that causes him to involuntarily travel through time. When 20-year-old Clare meets 28-year-old Henry at the Newberry Library in 1991 {{at the opening of the}} novel, he has never seen her before, although she has <b>known</b> <b>him</b> most of her life.|$|E

25|$|This {{caused more}} offence to Temple than {{the claim that}} he had {{committed}} an assault, and {{a long series of}} character witnesses testified that Temple had never consumed anything stronger than ginger ale as long as they had <b>known</b> <b>him.</b> The charges were dismissed.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} {{considerable}} {{concern about the}} police investigation into the girls' murders. It took nearly {{two weeks before the}} police became aware of previous sexual allegations against Huntley (they were contacted by a woman who had <b>known</b> <b>him</b> in Grimsby and was aware that he had once been charged with rape) and, although he was identified as the last person to see either of the two children, his story was not effectively checked out early during the investigation.|$|E

25|$|Pytheas was {{a central}} source of {{information}} on the North Sea and the subarctic regions of western Europe to later periods, and possibly the only source. The only ancient authors we know by name who certainly saw Pytheas' original text were Dicaearchus, Timaeus, Eratosthenes, Crates of Mallus, Hipparchus, Polybius, Artemidorus and Posidonius. Notably the list does not include Strabo or Tacitus, though Strabo discusses him and Tacitus may likely have known about his work. Either of the two could have <b>known</b> <b>him</b> through other writers or have read his work in the original.|$|E
25|$|Her husband became both sleepy and inattentive {{as he got}} older. The {{sleepiness}} led to a {{car accident}} where {{no one was hurt}} but Henry was charged with dangerous driving. He became obsessed by the Norwegian ballerina Gerd Larsen and he would refuse to travel with West but wanted to return to London to be with Larsen. West initially considered this to be purely her husband's infatuation, but she came to think that Larsen was driven by money. At her husband's funeral she had the upsetting problem of Larsen's request to be amongst the mourners, even though she had only <b>known</b> <b>him</b> for 18 months. Henry's will left £5,000 for Larsen.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{forget that}} ever since I {{was a child}} Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, and {{the person in the}} world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (who have <b>known</b> <b>him</b> for more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character. I think they have all behaved very ill to me, and for most of them, who certainly owe much more to me than I do to them, I feel nothing but contempt, and do not trouble myself about them; but Fitzwilliam is an exception indeed.|$|E

25|$|One {{friendship}} {{was made}} in these years that has been worth more than words can tell. I refer to that of Matthew McClung. To {{be known as a}} co-official with McClung was a privilege that only those who knew him can appreciate. I had <b>known</b> <b>him</b> before at Lehigh in his undergraduate days, and had played on the same teams with him Never was there a squarer sportsman, or a fairer, more conscientious and efficient official; nor a truer, more gallant type of real man than he. His early death took out of the game a man of the kind we can ill afford to lose and no tribute that I could pay him would be high enough.|$|E
25|$|Eliza Tierney, a 14-year-old servant at Starr's tavern, {{was called}} {{as a witness}} and testified that she had known Whelan for six weeks as a boarder {{who lived in a}} room {{on the first floor of}} the tavern, and that he had owned a pistol for as long as she had <b>known</b> <b>him.</b> However, she discredited the police {{evidence}} suggesting that a shot had been recently fired from Whelan's gun, by offering that one of the other servant girls had handled the pistol clumsily only a week before and shot herself in the arm. This was also confirmed by bookkeeper William Goulden in his testimony, who added that Whelan had offered to sell his pistol just six weeks before McGee was killed. Other evidence suggested that Whelan owned the pistol as he was fond of sport shooting.|$|E
25|$|Stack's {{unidentified}} persons {{report was}} {{entered into the}} National Missing and Unidentified Persons Database in June 2010, where details of the case were {{released to the public}} in effort to identify him. This case was eventually reopened by law enforcement in 2014. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children was also contacted by the Tooele County police department and created a forensic facial reconstruction of the subject by using mortuary photographs as an influence to create a likeness of his facial features. Subsequently, a poster was developed by the organization that was displayed to the public in hopes that he would be recognized by someone who may have <b>known</b> <b>him</b> in life. The cause of the victim's death was determined to have been two gunshot wounds to the head. This detail was not released to the public until a major break in the case developed.|$|E

25|$|None of Keats' biographies {{were written}} by people who had <b>known</b> <b>him.</b> Shortly after his death, his {{publishers}} announced they would speedily publish The memoirs and remains of John Keats but his friends refused to cooperate and argued {{with each other to}} the extent that the project was abandoned. Leigh Hunt's Lord Byron and some of his Contemporaries (1828) gives the first biographical account, strongly emphasising Keats's supposedly humble origins, a misconception which still continues. Given that he was becoming a significant figure within artistic circles, a succession of other publications followed, including anthologies of his many notes, chapters and letters. However, early accounts often gave contradictory or heavily biased versions of events and were subject to dispute. His friends Brown, Severn, Dilke, Shelley and his guardian Richard Abbey, his publisher Taylor, Fanny Brawne and many others issued posthumous commentary on Keats's life. These early writings coloured all subsequent biography and have become embedded in a body of Keats legend.|$|E
500|$|Nelson, {{who had not}} <b>known</b> <b>him</b> {{before this}} expedition, had {{conceived}} a great affection for Riou, and wrote 'In poor dear Riou the country has sustained an irreparable loss.'

500|$|By {{the time}} Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had {{returned}} to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her [...] "one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections {{of those who had}} <b>known</b> <b>him.</b> It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor.|$|E
500|$|In {{his final}} debate before the Iowa Caucus, Biden {{participated in the}} December 13 forum {{sponsored}} by The Des Moines Register. His most notable part came when {{asked to respond to}} allegations that he was [...] "uncomfortable" [...] speaking about race since making remarks earlier in the year when he referred to Barack Obama using the adjectives [...] "clean" [...] and [...] "articulate". Biden answered the question remarking that anyone who has <b>known</b> <b>him</b> knew of this commitment to civil rights and race relations. Barack Obama came to his defense, saying: [...] "Joe is {{on the right side of}} the issues and is fighting every day for a better America." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{argues that}} the bishop of Bangor in County Down, Dub Innse, {{described}} Israel as a [...] "Roman scholar", and that he therefore {{does not appear to}} have recognised him as a fellow Irishman. Lapidge states that Flodoard was contemporary with Israel and may have <b>known</b> <b>him,</b> whereas Ruotger wrote after Israel's death and probably did not have first hand knowledge. Giving children Old Testament Hebrew names such as Israel was common in Celtic areas in the tenth century. Lapidge concludes that Brittany is more likely than Wales or Cornwall, as manuscripts associated with him have Breton glosses, and Æthelstan's court was a haven for Breton scholars fleeing Viking occupation of their homeland.|$|E
