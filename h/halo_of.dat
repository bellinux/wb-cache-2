40|$|The {{computation}} <b>of</b> translunar <b>Halo</b> orbits <b>of</b> {{the real}} Earth-Moon system (REMS) {{has been an}} open problem for a long time, but now, {{it is possible to}} compute <b>Halo</b> orbits <b>of</b> the REMS in a systematic way. In this paper, we describe the method used for the numerical computation <b>of</b> <b>Halo</b> orbits for a time span longer than 41 years. <b>Halo</b> orbits <b>of</b> the REMS are computed from quasi-periodic <b>Halo</b> orbits <b>of</b> the Quasi-bicircular Problem (QBCP). The QBCP is a model for the dynamics of a spacecraft in the Earth-Moon-Sun system. It is a Hamiltonian system with three degrees of freedom and depending periodically on time. In this model, Earth, Moon and Sun are moving in a self-consistent motion close to bicircular. The computed <b>Halo</b> orbits <b>of</b> the REMS are compared with the family <b>of</b> <b>Halo</b> orbits <b>of</b> the QBCP.

5|$|Globular {{clusters}} {{are found}} in the <b>halo</b> <b>of</b> a galaxy and contain considerably more stars and are much older than the less dense open clusters, which {{are found in}} the disk of a galaxy. Globular clusters are fairly common; there are about 150 to 158 currently known globular clusters in the Milky Way, with perhaps 10 to 20 more still undiscovered. These globular clusters orbit the Galaxy at radii of 40 kiloparsecs (130,000 light-years) or more. Larger galaxies can have more: Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, may have as many as 500. Some giant elliptical galaxies (particularly those at the centers of galaxy clusters) such as M87, have as many as 13,000 globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of {{the motion}} of intracluster {{planetary}} nebulae between M87 and M86 suggest that these two galaxies are moving toward each other {{and this may be}} their first encounter. M87 may have encountered M84 in the past, as evidenced by the truncation of the outer <b>halo</b> <b>of</b> the former from tidal effects. However, another possible cause of this truncation is a contraction due to an unseen mass falling into M87 {{from the rest of the}} cluster, which, in particular, may be the hypothesized dark matter. A third possibility is that the halo formation was truncated as a result of early feedback from the active galactic nucleus at the core of M87.|$|E

40|$|Based on the SDSS catalog, we {{have found}} new close quasar-galaxy pairs. Quasars {{projected}} onto the <b>halos</b> <b>of</b> nearer galaxies are encountered among the multitude of quasars observed at various distances from us. Among them there are quasars that {{are close to the}} galaxies not only in angular separation, but also in redshift. Such quasar-galaxy pairs are called close pairs. We developed further the hypothesis that such pairs appear, because the fluxer on the nucleus of the more distant galaxy passes through <b>halo</b> globular clusters <b>of</b> the nearer galaxy,resulting in magnification and splitting of the image of the source that we interpret as a quasar. To corroborate this hypothesis, we analyzed the distribution of quasars in the plane <b>of</b> the <b>halos</b> <b>of</b> these galaxies. The quasars from close pairs were found to follow the density profile of globular clusters in the <b>halos</b> <b>of</b> elliptical and spiral galaxies with slopes of - 1. 5 and - 2. 4 for elliptical and spiral galaxies, respectively.

40|$|Background: Antimicrobial {{activity}} of restorative materials {{had an important}} role in preventing caries recurrence. Aims and Objectives: To evaluate the in vitro antibacterial effect of Glass Ionomer Cements (GIC) against Streptococcus mutans, S oralis, S. salivarius and Streptococcus sp. Materials and Methods: Three commercially available glass ionomer cements, i. e., GIC 1, GIC 2 and GIC 3 were evaluated. The products were manipulated in accordance with manufacturer’s guidelines and inserted into wells made-up in Petri plates containing Müeller Hinton Agar. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by using a caliper to measure the diameter <b>of</b> <b>halos</b> <b>of</b> growth inhibition of the strains assayed. The study was performed in triplicate and statistical analysis employed Kruskal-Wallis test (α= 5 %). Results: GIC 1 showed <b>halos</b> <b>of</b> growth inhibition in millimeters of 16 ± 2. 0, 16 ± 0. 0, 11 ± 1. 0 and 13 ± 2. 0 on S. mutans, S. oralis, S. salivarius and Streptococcus sp respectively.
