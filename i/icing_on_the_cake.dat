25|$|Holders Paris Saint-Germain were {{through to}} the last-16 of the League Cup after Fabrice Pancrate's goal proved enough for the reigning champions to beat AS Monaco. Paris Saint-Germain's defence of the League Cup {{continued}} against Nancy after the draw for the last-16, quarter-finals and semi-finals was made. Péguy Luyindula scored both goals in Paris Saint-Germain's victory over Nancy to send the holders {{through to the}} quarter-finals of the League Cup. In a dramatic twist of fate, Paris Saint-Germain hosted Lens in the pick of the quarter-final draw. In a remake of last season's Final, Paris Saint-Germain defeated Lens at the Parc des Princes {{to qualify for the}} semi-finals of the League Cup, where they met Bordeaux, winners over Châteauroux. Late goals from Souleymane Diawara and Wendel added to David Bellion's first-half strike put the <b>icing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> as Bordeaux cruised past Paris Saint-Germain in the League Cup semi-final at the Parc des Princes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the return}} {{leg of the}} quarter final tie, the Mariners {{demolished}} Salgaocar 4–0 riding on a brace from Haitian playmaker Sony Norde and goals from Katsumi Yusa and Jeje Lalpekhlua. It was Katsumi Yusa who started the scoring in the 25th minute reaching {{at the end of}} a Sony Norde cross and tapping it easily into an open net. Minutes away from the half time whistle Sony Norde scored his first of the match and the tournament as he beautifully cut in from the left and put the ball in the net past the goalkeeper to ensure that Bagan went into the lemon break with a 3-goal advantage on aggregate. The Green and Maroon brigade started off the second half, where they ended the first. It was a piece of individual brilliance by Haitian playmaker Sony Norde as he went past three Salgaocar defenders and put the ball in the net with relative ease to score his second of the night. In the final minute of the match, a beautiful through ball from Cornell Glen saw Jeje Lalpekhlua tap it in with utter ease to put the <b>icing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> of the Green and Maroon victory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We might profitably compare {{interpretation}} in discourse to {{the solution}} of a simultaneous equation in multiple variables. In a given utterance, there may be one or more anaphoric expressions or ellipses whose interpretation must be resolved, and one or more quantificational operators whose intended domain must be determined. I sketch how a general Gricean principle of Retrievability guides the resolution of all these types of variables {{and other kinds of}} context-sensitivity as well, taking into account requirements of relevance and salience which reflect the intentional structure of discourse generally assumed by interlocutors. In particular, relevance to an understood Question under Discussion constrains the search space for anaphora resolution and domain restriction in a thorough-going way, offering the foundation for a theory of salience. Moreover, the interaction between conventional content and context can only be captured in a dynamic model in which the formally modeled context changes in the course of compositional interpretation. This characterization of the role of context in interpretation stands in contrast to a commonly assumed model which treats interpretation (processing and comprehension) as a sequential affair, in which first we parse, then resolve a few indexicals in the course of compositionally determining the semantic content of the utterance, and finally put Gricean <b>icing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> propositional <b>cake.</b> But <b>the</b> proposed model is also more constrained than some other models of pragmatically-guided processing, including those of Sperber & Wilson (1985) and those based principally on rhetorical relations. I review experimental evidence from <b>the</b> psycholinguistic literature <b>on</b> both processing and acquisition which suggests that the intention-structured model of discourse is psychologically plausible and explanatory, and that it reveals important features of the interface between purely linguistic competence and more general cognitive processes, including practical reasoning, and information storage and retrieval. 1.

40|$|This article explores {{progress}} {{to date in}} embedding enabling social work understandings and practices with disabled people by reviewing the UK social work curriculum. Based on these observations and the ideas from UK disability studies, it will offer possible solutions or at least better pathways to enabling practice with disabled people. As Meekosha has pointed out in a global context, to date social work has been experienced as an ambivalent practice [Meekosha, H. & Dowse, L. (2007) ‘Integrating critical disability studies into social work education and practice: an Australian perspective’, Practice, vol. 19, no. 3, pp. 59 – 72], often both enabling and disabling; an intervention that can both lock and unlock resources, and challenge and reaffirm traditional notions of the ‘disability problem’ [Finkelstein, V. (1993) ‘Disability: A Social Challenge or an Administrative Responsibility?’, in Disabiling Barriers ‐ Enabling Environments, eds J. Swain, V. Finkelstein, S. French and M. Oliver, Sage Publications {{in association with the}} Open University, London]. Social work also has the potential to both challenge, but also be an (inadvertent) apologist for contemporary social support and welfare systems. Indeed it is clear that social work as a profession and social care as a policy area have been the poor relations of healthcare and health professions [King's Fund (2011) Social Care Funding and the NHS: An Impending Crisis?, King's Fund, London]. Viewed anthropologically, social work remains a largely non-disabled workforce ‘ministering’ to disabled clients (BCODP, 1997). This might reinforce the perception of ‘us and them’ in some social work encounters. As Paul Longmore questioned, can we begin to go ‘beyond affliction’ (2003) in our work with disabled people? Can social work help support the collective struggles of disabled people or is their role inevitably to reinforce that of individual(ised) clients? The development of the personalisation agenda and self-directed support is clearly welcome in this context [DoH (2006) Our Health, Our Care, Our Say: A New Direction for Community Services, Department of Health, London; DoH (2007) Independence, Choice and Risk: A Guide to Best Practice in Supported Decision-Making, Department of Health, London; DoH (2009) Personalisation of Social Care Services, Department of Health, London]. Such developments reflect the changing service user–professional relationship. The temptation to see these developments as <b>the</b> <b>icing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> social support <b>cake</b> needs, however, to be resisted. Arguably, with the increased rationing of social support, the continued role of social workers in assessment and monitoring of support could be seen to require a yet more reflexive and enabling professional education and training in an age of austerity, one where previously supported disabled people are being told that their needs can no longer be met...|$|R

[...] Praise was also given to Capaldi's performance in the special, [...] "If there’s one thing we never really saw in Capaldi’s first season as the Doctor, {{it was the kind of}} unabashed joy that so animated the 10th and 11th Doctors and made the tail-end of the 9th Doctor’s journey—including his Santa claim to Rose at the end of “The Doctor Dances”—so powerful. Well, it takes the full hour, but “Last Christmas” gets us there. It was worth the wait." [...] Digital Spy awarded the episode a 4 out of 5, stating that [...] "Moffat pulls off a number of difficult balancing acts spectacularly well, refusing to deliver another throwaway special that's heavy on the frothy festive cheer but light on real substance". They closed their review by saying [...] "Last Christmas is an absolute cracker. The festive fun factor is high, as is only right and proper, but it's often been said that Doctor Who is at its best when its roots are showing and here Moffat apes both Christopher Nolan's Inception and Ridley Scott's Alien to provide the viewer with both food for thought and fuel for our nightmares". The Daily Telegraph awarded the episode a 4 out of 5, calling it [...] "marvellously merry" [...] and stating that it [...] "had heart as well as head, so ended like a festive special should: happily, with a cockle-warming cosy glow".
