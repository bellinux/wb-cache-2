25|$|A bait car is {{a vehicle}} used by a law {{enforcement}} agency to capture car thieves. The vehicles are specially modified with features including GPS tracking and hidden cameras that record audio, video, time and date, which can all be remotely monitored by police. A remote-controlled <b>immobilizer</b> is installed in the vehicle that allows police to disable the engine and lock the doors. Jason Cecchettini invented the concept and technology in 1996.|$|E
30|$|Post-operatively, {{patients}} {{were kept in}} knee <b>immobilizers</b> for comfort for 1 – 3  days with hip flexion to protect against sciatic nerve stretch. Patients were mobilized beginning on the first post-op day and were allowed out of the knee <b>immobilizers</b> as comfort allowed. By {{the second or third}} post-op day, knee <b>immobilizers</b> were used at night only. Most patients wore rigid 90 ° ankle–foot orthoses for weight-bearing activities, and some patients wore ground reaction ankle–foot orthoses [7].|$|R
40|$|The {{automotive}} industry has developed electronic <b>immobilizers</b> {{to reduce the}} number of car thefts since the mid nineties. However, there is not much information on the current solutions in the public domain, and the annual number of stolen cars still causes a significant loss. This generates other costs particularly regarding the increased insurance fees each individual has to pay. In this paper we present a system model that captures a variety of security aspects concerning electronic <b>immobilizers.</b> We consider generic security and functional requirements for constructing secure electronic <b>immobilizers.</b> The main practical problems and limitations are addressed and we give some design guidance as well as possible solutions...|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the large}} number of false alarms with car alarms, many vehicle {{manufacturers}} no longer factory-fit simple noise-making alarms, instead offering silent <b>immobilizers.</b> Alternatively, an aftermarket vehicle tracking system can enable the police to trace stolen vehicles. Most police tracking systems require the user to pay a recurring fee, whereas factory <b>immobilizers</b> are included in the purchase price of the vehicle. GPS locating systems enable the owner of the vehicle to lock and unlock, track, and disable the starter of the vehicle online.|$|R
25|$|A wheel clamp, {{also known}} as a Denver boot or wheel boot, is a device that is {{designed}} to prevent vehicles from moving. In its most common form, it consists of a clamp which surrounds a vehicle wheel, designed to prevent removal of both itself and the wheel. Wheel clamps are used in order to enforce laws against unauthorized or illegal parking, in lieu of towing the offending vehicle, and for security purposes such as a deterrent against stolen vehicles by thieves. Originally known as the auto <b>immobilizer,</b> the wheel clamp or Denver boot was invented in 1953 by Frank Marugg of Denver Colorado. A patent was filed on May 7, 1955 and issued three years later on July 28, 1958.|$|E
25|$|Doctors treat a {{dislocation}} {{by putting}} {{the head of the}} humerus back into the joint socket (glenoid fossa) of the scapula — a procedure called manipulation and reduction (M). This is usually followed up with an x ray to make sure the reduction did not fracture the surrounding bones. The arm is then immobilized in a sling or a device called a shoulder <b>immobilizer</b> for several days. Usually the doctor recommends resting the shoulder and applying ice {{three or four times a}} day. After pain and swelling have been controlled, the patient enters a rehabilitation program that includes exercises to restore the range of motion of the shoulder and strengthen the muscles to prevent future dislocations. These exercises may progress from simple motion to the use of weights.|$|E

An MRI revealed {{that she had}} fractured the tibia in her left leg. The injury occurred shortly before teammate Aly Raisman injured herself performing on the same bars. On September 13, 2012, Maroney had two screws inserted to repair the fractured left tibia. She wore an <b>immobilizer</b> to keep the leg straight until doctors determined that {{she was ready to}} resume limited walking and rebuilding range of motion. Maroney returned to The Kellogg's Tour on October 4, 2012 in Oklahoma City on light duty. She was seen during the finale wearing her leg and foot splints and also at the VIP Meet and Greet session after the event.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1990s to the mid-2000s, Winnipeg had a {{significant}} auto-theft problem, with the rate peaking at 2,165.0 per 100,000 residents in 2006 compared to 487 auto-thefts per 100,000 residents for Canada as a whole. To combat auto theft, Manitoba Public Insurance established financial incentives for motor vehicle owners to install ignition <b>immobilizers</b> in their vehicles, and now requires owners of high-risk vehicles to install <b>immobilizers.</b> The auto-theft rate {{has been on a}} constant drop since 2006. Other types of property crime have also decreased, but rates are still fairly high.|$|R

2500|$|In late 1999, several {{noteworthy}} {{changes for}} the P11 came as a refresh in the 2000 model year, when the 145 crank horsepower roller rocker variant of the SR20DE engine was implemented, newer automatic and manual transmission variations were introduced, anti-theft <b>immobilizer</b> circuitry was added, anti-glare side mirrors became standard, and a remote trunk release {{was added to the}} keyless entry fob. In 2001, the G20t was dropped and a Sport model was introduced. In addition to the prior G20t's limited slip differential and decklid spoiler, this model featured two-tone leather/suede sport seats, 16" [...] wheels, and a variety of minor cosmetic modifications. The 2002 base G20 received the 12-spoke Touring alloy wheels as standard.|$|E
2500|$|This {{version of}} the Batmobile is a simple sleek pod with sharp angles and rounded sides. Its {{interior}} is a red illuminated single-person cockpit, with computer circuitry and displays visible all around. It is armed with guided <b>immobilizer</b> missiles and grappling cables. Being a [...] "single-seat" [...] by design, it {{was never meant to}} carry two people, as shown when Terry's friend Maxine was once sitting behind the seat to great discomfort. According to Bruce, the vehicles top speed is Mach 3; however Terry has never piloted the vehicle at those speeds through Gotham City. It features a drop down hatch; this allows Terry swift exit/entrance from underneath without having to park the vehicle and get out, allowing him to literally get the drop on his opponents. Like Terry's batsuit the Batmobile features a camouflage system rendering it invisible; however another system consisting of holographic projector disguising it as a simple garbage dumpster or random car to keep away prying eyes and potential vandals. The vehicle has built in digital recorders and cameras for collecting audio and visual evidence.|$|E
50|$|An <b>Immobilizer</b> {{can never}} be {{captured}} by an <b>Immobilizer,</b> or Imitator (Chameleon). An <b>Immobilizer</b> {{can never be}} captured by a king or Withdrawer unless the variation popular in Cambridge is being played, {{in which case the}} <b>Immobilizer</b> itself must first be immobilized. When an <b>Immobilizer</b> comes into contact with an enemy Chameleon or <b>Immobilizer,</b> the two pieces freeze each other, after which neither can move unless the other is captured. In the version played at Cambridge, the power of an enemy <b>Immobilizer</b> to arrest a friendly piece's movement is defeated when another friendly <b>Immobilizer</b> or Chameleon is brought up to it, effectively cancelling out each other's power to arrest movement.|$|E

50|$|The Imitators (or Chameleons), {{represented}} by the bishops, capture any piece by moving {{as a piece of}} the type captured would have moved to capture. Also Imitators or Chameleons immobilize enemy <b>Immobilizers</b> to which they are adjacent. Imitators cannot capture Imitators. In order for an Imitator to capture an enemy king, it must begin its turn adjacent to it, and step into its square. This is because the king is the only piece on the board that steps one square at a time, and captures by 'occupation' and 'replacement' - stepping into the enemy's square to capture it.|$|R

40|$|Due to {{advances}} in silicon manufacturing technology, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems {{are useful in}} many applications such as automobile <b>immobilizers,</b> animal tracking, payment systems, automatic toll collection and inventory management. As RFID systems use both radio and wire communication, security issues become a critical concern. However, even if security and privacy solutions have been proposed {{for the past several}} years, a important study about transmission error influence on security solutions is still missing. Indeed, all radio communications depend upon error transmission rate, particularly for exchanged security messages. As a result, transmission errors can degrade the reliability and the stability of some security solutions. This paper first discusses some existing security proposals for RFID systems; then, it focuses on the influence of transmission errors on these security proposals. Finally, we suggest a novel cross-layer architecture designed to improve the reliability of security and privacy solutions. Key words...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{potential}} of the two phototrophic microorganisms, both isolated from Ebro Delta microbial mats, to be used as bioindicators and <b>immobilizers</b> of chromium. The results obtained indicated that (i) the Minimum Metal Concentration (MMC) significantly affecting Chlorophyll a intensity in Geitlerinema sp. DE 2011 and Scenedesmus sp.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{examined}} the application of soil amendments, including pH change-induced <b>immobilizers,</b> adsorbents, and organic materials, for soil remediation. This study evaluated the effects of various amendments on trace element stabilization and phytotoxicity, depending on the initial soil pH in acid, neutral, and alkali conditions. As in all types of soils, Fe and Ca were well stabilized on adsorption sites. There was an effect from pH control or adsorption mechanisms on the stabilization of cationic trace elements from inorganic amendments in acidic and neutral soil. Furthermore, acid mine drainage sludge has shown great potential for stabilizing most trace elements. In a phytotoxicity test, the ratio of the bioavailable fraction to the pseudo-total fraction significantly affected the uptake of trace elements by bok choy. While inorganic amendments efficiently decreased the bioavailability of trace elements, significant effects from organic amendments were not noticeable due to the short-term cultivation period. Therefore, the application of organic amendments for stabilizing trace elements in agricultural soil requires further study...|$|R
