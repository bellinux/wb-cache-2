5|$|Adolf Hitler summoned Lieutenant-General Kurt Student of the 7. Flieger-Division (7th Air Division) {{to discuss}} the assault. It was first {{suggested}} that a conventional parachute drop be made by airborne forces to seize and destroy the forts' guns before the land units approached. Such a suggestion was rejected as the Junkers Ju 52 transports were too slow and {{were likely to be}} vulnerable to Dutch and Belgian anti-aircraft guns. Other factors for its refusal were the weather conditions, which might blow the paratroopers away from the fort and disperse them too widely. A seven-second <b>drop</b> <b>from</b> a Ju 52 at minimum operational height led to a dispersion over 300metres alone.|$|E
5|$|All slow loris species {{produce a}} toxin in glands on {{the insides of}} their elbows. This is spread across their bodies and those of their {{offspring}} using the toothcomb while grooming. When threatened with predators, the Sunda slow loris can bite, roll into a ball exposing its toxic saliva-covered fur, or roll up and <b>drop</b> <b>from</b> the trees. However, the primary method of predator avoidance is crypsis, whereby it hides. The Asiatic reticulated python, the changeable hawk-eagle and the Bornean orangutan have been recorded as predators of the Sunda slow loris.|$|E

5|$|Argentina {{abandoned}} {{the gold standard}} in December 1929, earlier than most countries. For much of the previous period, the country had operated a currency board, in which a body known as the caja de conversión was charged with maintaining the peso's value in gold. The devaluation of the peso increased the competitiveness of its exports and protected domestic production. Argentina saw {{the value of its}} exports <b>drop</b> <b>from</b> $1,537 million in 1929 to $561 million in 1932, but this was by no means the most severe downturn in the region.|$|E

In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari closed the gap to leaders Mercedes, now trailing 310 to 463 points. This race would prove to be the only one that Lewis Hamilton did not finish in the season.|$|E

5|$|It {{took several}} years for Ivy to {{finalize}} the material {{included on the}} album, due {{to the birth of}} lead singer Dominque Durand and musician Andy Chase's daughter, Justine, in 1999.

However, independent record label Nettwerk offered to fund the album; Ivy signed with both labels and began preparing it for a national release.|$|E
5|$|Planetary {{models of}} atoms were not new, but Bohr's {{treatment}} was. Taking the 1912 paper by Darwin {{on the role}} of electrons in the interaction of alpha particles with a nucleus as his starting point, he advanced the theory of electrons travelling in orbits around the atom's nucleus, with the chemical properties of each element being largely determined by the number of electrons in the outer orbits of its atoms. He introduced the idea that an electron could <b>drop</b> <b>from</b> a higher-energy orbit to a lower one, in the process emitting a quantum of discrete energy. This became a basis for what is now known as the old quantum theory.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that track surfaces, horseshoes with toe grabs, use of certain legal medications, and high-intensity racing {{schedules}} may also contribute to a high injury rate.
