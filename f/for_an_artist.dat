The centrepiece {{of the collection}} is the National Art Glass Gallery, a nationally significant collection of studio art glass hosted in a separate, specially designed gallery. The collection was first established by {{the former director of}} the Wagga Wagga Regional Art Gallery, Judy Le Lievre in response to a request by the Australia Council for regional galleries to develop a specialised collection to avoid duplication and competition. The collection consists of around 400 works making it the largest studio glass collection in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, with many considering it a highlight from the album. Many reviewers complimented its production and clever interpolation of the DeBarge sample, while some criticized it {{for being too}} simple <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> of Carey's caliber. Though expected by critics to have surely become Carey's 19th chart-topping single in the United States, the track only managed to reach a peak position of number fifty-eight on the Billboard Hot 100. Throughout other countries where it was released, the song achieved relatively weak charting, peaking within the top forty in Japan and Slovakia, and peaking at numbers sixty-nine and eighty-four in Canada and the United Kingdom, respectively.|$|E
5|$|When Minnie {{decided to}} take up {{painting}} in 2000 while she waited for her daughter Barbara to complete a canvas in an Adelaide workshop, the reception was immediately positive: she had her first solo exhibition that same year at Melbourne's Flinders Lane Gallery. She was first selected to exhibit in the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2002. One of her pieces, Awelye Atnwengerrp, was exhibited in the 2003 Award, in which her name was given as Minnie Motorcar Apwerl (Pwerle). The artist's asking price for the picture, A$44,000, was the second-highest in the exhibition and the highest <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> from the central and western deserts. Her painting Awelye Atnwengerrp 2 was exhibited in the 2005 competition.|$|E

25|$|<b>For</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> {{working in}} the 15th century, some study {{of the nature of}} light was essential. It was by the {{effective}} painting of light falling on a surface that modelling, or a three-dimensional appearance was to be achieved in a two-dimensional medium. It was also well understood by artists like Leonardo's teacher, Verrocchio, that an appearance of space and distance could be achieved in a background landscape by painting in tones that were less in contrast and colors that were less bright than in the foreground of the painting. The effects of light on solids were achieved by trial and error, since few artists except Piero della Francesca actually had accurate scientific knowledge of the subject.|$|E
25|$|Fan {{stated that}} every game {{he worked on}} had only him {{designing}} the prototype, adding {{that he used to}} draw a lot before he made games, where he made pixel art. The final designs of the zombies and the first plants are similar to how they were initially. After searching <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist,</b> they discovered Rich Werner, who Fan thought clicked with what he intended for the design. He attributed the intrigue of the design to its animation scheme; Tod Semple suggested that they animate it in Flash and export it into the game. Fan worried that this would look like it was cut out from paper, and would resemble South Park too much, but was satisfied in the end, attributing this to Semple and Werner's talents.|$|E

25|$|Kings Bay also {{generated}} {{revenue from}} selling fuel, supplies and air transport to shrimp fishers. From the 1970s the Coast Guard started calling regularly at Ny-Ålesund {{to assist in}} the transport of scientific instruments. During the early 1980s a plan for cultural heritage management was developed, which included the renovation of several older houses. Members of the Norwegian Railway Club restored a train which was put on display. Ny-Ålesund Town and Mine Museum opened in 1988. Very little of the town was listed with the initial pre-1900 conservation rules from 1974, but from 1992 larger parts were listed following automatic listing of all pre-1945 human traces. There had also since the 1970s been irregular visits by artists. From 1986 a building was refurbished to allow <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> to stay there at any time. By 1985 there were sixteen universities with scientific activities. In 1987 the University of Tromsø built a scientific greenhouse next to the school and by 1987 Kings Bay had twenty people working in Ny-Ålesund during the summer.|$|E

500|$|... "Unfaithful" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from most music critics. Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times described [...] "Unfaithful" [...] as [...] "a profoundly ludicrous – but not disagreeable – pop lament". Quentin B. Huff from PopMatters [...] commented that, [...] "Unfaithful' is a well-intentioned ballad informed by dramatic piano and strings". Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani stated, [...] "The melodramatic, string-laden ballad 'Unfaithful' is, if nothing else, an ambitious second single <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> like Rihanna, and with lyrics like 'I don't {{want to be}} a murderer/Our love, his trust/I might as well take a gun and put it to his head,' it earns bonus points just for being so fucking weird".|$|E
500|$|The Matrix, who {{produced}} six songs for Lavigne, five of which {{appear in the}} album, had another explanation of how the collaboration went. According to them, they wrote much of the portions in the three singles: [...] "Complicated", [...] "Sk8er Boi", and [...] "I'm with You", which were conceived using a guitar and piano. Christy said, [...] "Avril {{would come in and}} sing a few melodies, change a word here or there." [...] Reid complemented the issue over the credits: [...] "If I'm looking for a single <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist,</b> I don't care who writes it. Avril had the freedom to do as she really pleased, and the songs show her point of view. ... Avril has always been confident about her ideas." ...|$|E

Critics praised the show, noting Madonna's cautious performance. However, M.I.A. extended her middle finger to the camera {{near the end of}} her verse of [...] "Give Me All Your Luvn in place of the word [...] "shit". The rapper was criticized, and the NFL apologized for its inability to blur out the image. The league later fined M.I.A. $16.6 million, which was settled in a confidential 2014 agreement.|$|E

500|$|Boydell's {{relationships}} with his illustrators were generally congenial. One of them, James Northcote, praised Boydell's liberal payments. He {{wrote in an}} 1821 letter that Boydell [...] "did more {{for the advancement of}} the arts in England than the whole mass of the nobility put together! [...] He paid me more nobly than any other person has done; and his memory I shall ever hold in reverence". Boydell typically paid the painters between £105 to £210, and the engravers between £262 and £315. Joshua Reynolds at first declined Boydell's offer to work on the project, but he agreed when pressed. [...] Boydell offered Reynolds carte blanche for his paintings, giving him a down payment of £500, an extraordinary amount <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> who had not even agreed to do a specific work. [...] Boydell eventually paid him a total of £1,500.|$|E

His performances in Barcelona, Marbella, and Tenerife were among the country's highest grossing shows of 1999. Miguel then toured South America where he performed in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and Venezuela. In Argentina, he drew over 50,000 attendees at his concerts, and over 101,800 spectators attended his eight shows in Chile, the largest audiences of the year <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist.</b> The first leg of the tour ended on 15 December 1999 in Maracaibo, Venezuela. A concert was planned for the San Jose Arena in California on New Year's Eve, but was canceled because the gross income would not meet Miguel's requirements.|$|E

500|$|Conway {{described}} the panel as indicating [...] "an astonishing depth of psychological insight" [...] <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> not yet 20 years old. In its simple design and detail it shares {{many of the}} characteristics of, and is a key precursor to, Dürer's mature work. He [...] portrayed his father again in 1497, when the older man would have been around 70. He has aged noticeably in the intervening seven years: his skin is saggier, the wrinkles deeper and more pronounced. In this later portrait Dürer seems at pains to convey these effects of ageing, which are all too evident on his father's face. According to Brion, his eyes have lost their [...] "distant, mystic" [...] appearance and now seem less contented. Conway agrees, seeing traces of haggardly agitation, but holds that the two paintings convey a similar overall highly favourable and compassionate impression of the man.|$|E
500|$|Looking back on {{the tour}} as a whole, and in {{combination}} with the preceding Magic Tour, Billboard magazine cover story stated that [...] "Even <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> who has largely built his career on epic shows, Springsteen and the E Streeters have managed to find yet another gear at this stage in their legendary career." [...] Springsteen himself said, [...] "With the end of these shows, we're coming {{to the end of a}} decade-long project that really was a tremendous renewal of the power, the strength and the service that our band hopefully provides." [...] Springsteen also touted the quality of the shows: [...] "I believe if you come and see us now you're seeing the best E Street Band that's ever played." [...] Specific shows from the tour were named as among the best concerts of 2009 by Spin magazine, The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and the Chicago Tribune.|$|E
500|$|Described {{as being}} very sexy and more grown up by Simpson, the opening title track was written by the Swedish duo Anders Bagge and Arnthor Birgisson, in {{collaboration}} with English singer-songwriter Pamela Sheyne. Birgisson told music technology magazine Sound on Sound that they started developing the song after Sheyne proposed the title and concept. Bagge and Birgisson developed the melody and completed the song's lyrics. Sheyne also sings backing vocals in the song. [...] "A Little Bit" [...] was written by Kara DioGuardi, along with Steve Morales and David Siegal. Although she had the written songs for other artists including Kylie Minogue and Martine McCutcheon, the song became DioGuardi's first writing credit <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> from her native country. Simpson said that [...] "the message behind the song is for the guys {{to listen to the}} girl."
