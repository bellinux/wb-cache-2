The gaseous fuel {{used in this}} study was a mixture of natural gas with 97 % methane and CO 2. Three equivalence ratios; 0. 75 (lean), 1 (stochiometric) and 1. 2 (rich) were used in the experiments. An experimental setup that consists of a stainless steel pulse detonation tube with 100 mm inner diameter and 1700 mm length, <b>ignition</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> and filling station was installed to measure the characteristics of pulse combustion such as pressure and velocity. The effect of different equivalence ratio and different percentage of dilution on the performance of pulse combustion detonation was investigated by using Chapman-Jouguet theory. Two modes of pulse combustion propagation wave were observed: deflagration, detonation and in some cases deflagration to detonation transition (DDT). Results showed that the sensitivity of the mixture toward the detonation decreased with the increase of carbon dioxide dilution and increased with the increment of the equivalence ratio. In this study, for the mixture with 50 % dilution, DDT and high speed deflagration with the velocity of around 700 m/s were observed. The results were compared with calculated data using Chemical Equilibrium with Application (CEA) code and it was considered that CEA is useful software for calculating Chapman-Jougeut detonation parameters such as detonation velocity and pressure. From the analysis of detonation cell width in the soot foil technique, it was observed that the stochiometric mixture produces bigger cell width compared to rich mixture. So this indicates that the detonation wave of rich mixture can propagate through a smaller tube compared to lean and stochiometric mixtures...|$|R

40|$|All {{around the}} world the number of {{automobiles}} has increased many folds (about ten times) in {{the last fifty years}} which resulted in an enormous increase in urban pollution level especially in developing countries. Pakistan has been considered as the most urbanized country in South East Asia with about 36 % of Pakistan. s total population is residing in towns & cities. It has been estimated that an average vehicle in Pakistan emits 20 times more unburned hydrocarbons (UHCs), 24 times as much carbon monoxide (CO) & about 3. 6 times more oxides of nitrogen (NOx) when compared to an average vehicle in U. S. Furthermore the scarcity of conventional fuels also propelled the world to explore alternative fuel options with same or preferably less environmental implications. Natural gas is rated as high octane alternative fuel with octane rating of 120 ~ 130 and exhibiting clean burning characteristics. It is possible to attain increased efficiency from natural gas because of its high octane value with the increase of the compression ratio of the engine. Further the improved combustion efficiency of natural gas fuel also reduces the tail pipe pollutant emission. The focus of this research is to suggest the optimum compression ratio at which the performance of dedicated natural gas engine can be optimized. A 2. 5 L Diesel Engine was selected and converted to run solely on natural gas as dedicated mode by incorporating spark plugs, electronic <b>ignition</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> and CNG fuel metering system. Different piston sets were modified to obtain selected compression ratios. Based on the literature review, compression ratios were 11, 12, 13 & 14 had been selected. The temperature gauges were installed in the cooling water circuit and exhaust manifold to measure the water & exhaust gas temperatures. The engine was then tested on dynamometer for performance & exhaust emission. The readings of NOx, CO, UHCs at 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 and 3000 rpm at selected compression ratios were taken by using 5 -gas exhaust gas analyzer. For emission testing, steady-state test profile was generated. Exhaust gas temperatures were also recorded at different rpm settings at selected compression ratios. The results have been plotted and normalized by power. Based on the engine performance, the compression ratio of 13 has been selected as optimum compression ratio for dedicated CNG engine. For further reduction of engine exhaust emission Three-Way Catalytic simulation through Chemkin software has been carried out and the performance parameters were also predicted through simulation using single-zone thermodynamic model...|$|R

This work provides {{a detailed description of}} the design, development and testing of the remote <b>control</b> <b>system</b> developed for a High Pressure Gas Turbine Combustor (HPTC). ^ The combustor has the capability to operate at pressures up to 1. 5 MPa and temperatures up to 2400 K. It is also designed for a maximum air and fuel flow rates of 81. 93 g/s and 35. 77 g/s respectively. The fuel used will be CH 4 for the early experiments but it is designed to operate using a mixture of H 2 -CO with a hydrogen fuel composition variation of up to 30 percent. The HPTC also has optical accessibility capabilities in its combustion chamber with a converging nozzle that restricts the exhaust flow. It also has three circular ports that can be used as instrumentation ports to obtain real time data from the combustion chamber. ^ LabVIEW was used as the controlling interface for the user. A detailed outline of the LabVIEW programming is also described. LabVIEW controlled the proportional valves (ball valves), and solenoid valves; it also provided the user with data from mass flow meters as well as pressure transducers. Both proportional and solenoid valves are 1. 91 cm and can withstand pressures of up to 1551 kPa. Thermal mass flow meters were used to obtain the flow in the lines with a range from 200 - 1000 L/min with an accuracy of 1. 5 percent. Pressure transducers with a range from 0 to 2068 kPa were also positioned on the lines in order to know the line pressures. ^ The ignition system design, development and testing is also described with its integration to the High Pressure Gas Turbine Combustor. A modified spark plug was used to provide the igniter with an ignition source. A diffusion flame was used to ignite the main line using methane as the fuel that utilizes the air in the combustion chamber as the oxidizer. Testing included a functional test of the equipment, and pressure testing prior to performing the ignition test. The system has the capability to withstand the maximum pressure allowed by the air compressor, which is 758 kPa.
