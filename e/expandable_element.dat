40|$|An {{intumescent}} material {{fire stop}} device, comprising a support body shaped {{so as to}} take a collar-like shape around an axis and to define an opening intended to house a pipe, an <b>expandable</b> <b>element,</b> made up {{of at least one}} intumescent material and positioned in the support body, and one or more foldable fin joined to the support body by at least one respective hinge portion along a radially inner peripheral edge of said opening. Due to the expansion of the <b>expandable</b> <b>element,</b> the fins are movable between an initial position, in which the fins are substantially parallel to each other and not intercepting said opening, to a closing position, in which the fins converge towards the axis to close at least partially the opening. Advantageously the <b>expandable</b> <b>element</b> is made of at least one first intumescent material, expandable at temperatures equal to or greater than a first activation temperature T 1, and at least one second intumescent material, expandable at temperatures equal to or greater than a second activation temperature T 2 higher than said first activation temperature T 1. The first intumescent material and the second intumescent material are axially staggered...|$|E
40|$|A {{noise source}} for an {{aircraft}} engine {{active noise cancellation}} {{system in which the}} resonant frequency of a noise radiating element is tuned to permit noise cancellation over a wide range of frequencies. The resonant frequency of the noise radiating element is tuned by a plurality of force transmitting mechanisms which contact the noise radiating element. Each one of the force transmitting mechanisms includes an <b>expandable</b> <b>element</b> and a spring in contact with the noise radiating element so that excitation of the element varies the spring force applied to the noise radiating element. The elements are actuated by a controller which receives input of a signal proportional to displacement of the noise radiating element and a signal corresponding to the blade passage frequency of the engine's fan. In response, the controller determines a control signal which is sent to the elements and causes the spring force applied to the noise radiating element to be varied. The force transmitting mechanisms can be arranged to either produce bending or linear stiffness variations in the noise radiating element...|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} an improved expandable intramedullary nail for the fixation of bone fractures. The nail includes an elongate sleeve having one end adapted to be inserted within the medullary cavity of the bone. The {{one end of}} the sleeve is formed of a predetermined maximum retracted diameter to permit the insertion of the one end within the bone cavity. A plurality of circumferentially spaced, radially <b>expandable</b> <b>elements</b> are carried by the {{one end of the}} sleeve. The elements are radially movable from a first, retracted position wherein the elements define a first diameter to a second, expanded position wherein the elements define a second diameter greater than the predetermined maximum retracted diameter and the first diameter. In accordance with the present invention, when the elements are in the expanded position, the elements provide at least two support points at the second diameter and axially spaced along the sleeve for engagement with the inner wall of the bone cavity. A camming member is carried by the one end of the elongate sleeve for moving the elements from the retracted position to the expanded position. An actuator is located {{at the other end of}} the sleeve and is coupled to operate the camming member for controlling the radial position of the elements...|$|R
50|$|MUST-equipped {{surgical}} {{hospitals were}} operated {{for several years}} in Vietnam with mixed success. These units consisted of three basic elements, each {{of which could be}} airlifted and dispatched by truck or helicopter. The <b>expandable</b> surgical <b>element</b> was a self-contained, rigid-panel shelter with accordion sides. The air-inflatable ward element was a double-walled fabric shelter providing a free-space area for ward facilities. The utility element or power package contained a multifuel gas turbine engine which supplied electric power for air-conditioning, refrigeration, air heating and circulation, water heating and pumping, air pressure for the inflatable elements, and compressed air or suction. In addition, other expandables were used for central materiel supply, laboratory, X-ray, pharmacy, dental, and kitchen facilities.|$|R
40|$|Current {{options for}} Lunar habitat {{architecture}} include inflatable habitats and airlocks. Inflatable structures can have mass and volume advantages over conventional structures. However, inflatable structures carry different inherent risks and {{are at a}} lower Technical Readiness Level (TRL) than more conventional metallic structures. One of {{the risks associated with}} inflatable structures is in understanding the tolerance to induced damage. The Damage Tolerance Test (DTT) is designed to study the structural integrity of an expandable structure. TransHab (Figure 1) was an experimental inflatable module developed at the NASA/Johnson Space Center in the 1990 s. The TransHab design was originally envisioned for use in Mars Transits but was also studied as a potential habitat for the International Space Station (ISS). The design of the TransHab module was based on a woven design using an Aramid fabric. Testing of this design demonstrated a high level of predictability and repeatability with analytical predictions of stresses and deflections. Based on JSC s experience with the design and analysis of woven inflatable structures, the Damage Tolerance Test article was designed and fabricated using a woven design. The DTT article was inflated to 45 psig, representing 25 % of the ultimate burst pressure, and one of the one-inch wide longitudinal structural members was severed by initiating a Linear Shaped Charge (LSC). Strain gage measurements, at the interface between the <b>expandable</b> <b>elements</b> (straps) and the nonexpandable metallic elements for pre-selected longitudinal straps, were taken throughout pressurization of the module and strap separation. Strain gage measurements show no change in longitudinal strap loading at the bulkhead interface after strap separation indicating loads in the restraint layer were re-distributed local to the damaged area due to the effects of friction under high internal pressure loading. The test completed all primary objectives with better than expected results. This paper will discuss space inflatable structures, damage tolerance analysis, test results, and applicability to the Lunar architecture...|$|R
40|$|<b>Expandable</b> {{habitable}} <b>elements</b> are an {{enabling technology}} for human exploration {{in space and}} on planetary surfaces. Large geometries can be deployed from a small launch volume, allowing greater mission capability while reducing mass and improving robustness over traditional rigid shells. This report describes research performed by ILC Dover under the Intelligent Flexible Materials for Space Structures program on the design and manufacture of softgoods for LaRC's Expandable Habitat Engineering Development Unit (EDU). The EDU is a full-scale structural test article of an expandable hybrid habitat, integrating an expandable softgoods center section with two rigid end caps. The design of the bladder, restraint layer and a mock-up Thermal Micrometeoroid Cover is detailed together with {{the design of the}} interface hardware used to attach them to the end caps. The integration and design of two windows and a floor are also covered. Analysis was performed to study the effects of the open weave design, and to determine the correct webbing and fabric configuration. Stress analyses were also carried out on the interfaces between the softgoods and the end caps and windows. Testing experimentally determined the strength of the fabric and straps, and component testing was used to proof several critical parts of the design. This program established new manufacturing and design techniques that can be applied to future applications in expandable structures...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{the results of}} a research focused on the development of a multi-scale geodatabase designed to store the data needed to measure the energy buildings performance of buildings to be used for the planning activities of local administrations. Due to the great complexity of the application domain, the proposed data model has been structured in three main components: the building/heating system, the users, and the environmental/territorial context. Furthermore the characteristics of these components and of their mutual relationships have led to the decision to use geometries in the 3 D space. The applications also need a significant semantic content, <b>expandable</b> with customized <b>elements</b> and properties. These peculiarities directed us to select the OGC CityGML standard format as the best choice for the data model. This choice has been tested with positive results. * Corresponding author.

40|$|Stellar Imager (SI) is a {{potential}} NASA space-based UV imaging interferometer to resolve the stellar disks of nearby stars. SI would consist of 20 - 30 separate spacecraft flying in formation at the Earth-Sun L 2 libration point. Onboard wavefront control {{would be required to}} initially align the formation and maintain alignment during science observations and after array reconfiguration. The Fizeau Interferometry Testbed (FIT) is a testbed currently under development at the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center to develop and study the wavefront control methodologies for Stellar Imager and other large, sparse aperture telescope systems. FIT consists of 7 articulated spherical mirrors in a Golay pattern, <b>expandable</b> upto 30 <b>elements,</b> and reconfigurable into multiple array patterns. FIT’s purpose is to demonstrate image quality versus array configuration and to develop and advance the wavefront control for SI. FIT uses extended scene wavelength, focus and field diversity to estimate the wavefront across the set of apertures. The recovered wavefront is decomposed into the eigenmodes of the control matrix and actuators are moved to minimize the wavefront piston, tip and tilt. Each mirror’s actuators are 3 degrees of freedom, however, they do not move each of the mirrors about a point on each mirrors surface, thus the mapping from wavefront piston, tip/tilt to mirror piston, tip/tilt is not diagonal. We initially estimate this mapping but update it as part o...|$|R
