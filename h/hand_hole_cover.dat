40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{compression}} strength of the corrugated shipping containers having the conventional purpose <b>hand</b> <b>holes</b> and the arc top <b>hand</b> <b>holes.</b> Generally, the arc top <b>hand</b> <b>hole</b> has stronger tear strength than the conventional purpose <b>hand</b> <b>hole,</b> but the arc top <b>hand</b> <b>hole</b> has a larger opening area than the conventional purpose <b>hand</b> <b>hole,</b> and the larger opening area needs more space of a dispersion of compression stress to increase compression resistance. However, when a <b>hand</b> <b>hole</b> has enough space to distribute compression stress, the only one variable is the width of the opening area in shipping containers if the containers have the same dimensions. In this study, two designs of the <b>hand</b> <b>hole</b> have the same width of opening area and are located to have enough space to distribute compression stress. As a result, the resistance forces of containers are the same in each different environment...|$|R

The project entitled Design and Fabricate of <b>Hole</b> <b>Cover</b> by Casting Process. This project focus on redesign electrical output <b>hole</b> <b>cover.</b> The objective of this project is redesigning <b>hole</b> <b>cover</b> with Computer Aid Design (CAD) and fabricating by using casting process. In overall this project started with designing process by using Solid Work software. Then it has followed by casting process. The casting process has a few steps. The first step is making pattern by using wood material. Then preparing mold by using the finished pattern. The process continues with melting the material in furnace and pouring them into mold. After that is cooling the material. The material must be cool sufficiently before remove the mold by wire brush. Lastly is finishing process by machine to remove any excessive material. As the result, a new pattern of electric output <b>hole</b> <b>cover</b> has been designed and fabricated it by casting process. After all the process had been done, this project helps in gaining knowledge about designing by Solid Work software and fabricating by casting process...|$|R

40|$|Corrugated {{packaging}} is used {{to package}} approximately 90 % of all products that reach retail store shelves and aisles in the United States. A large number of these corrugated shippers are used to ship fresh produce and perishables through the cold-chain environment that requires these boxes to have venting to permit air circulation. In addition, corrugated boxes for that are large in size and contain heavier products, may have <b>hand</b> <b>holes</b> to facilitate manual handling. The presence of ventilation and <b>hand</b> <b>holes</b> both cause a loss of material in two or more faces of the box. As a result the compression strength required for shipping and stacking is compromised and can result in damageto contents. <b>Hand</b> <b>holes</b> that do not meetthe appropriate strength requirements can be a safety issue in manual handling if the contents are released when handling. This study was initiated to understand the loss of compression strength in corrugated containers {{as a function of}} size, shape and location of ventilation and <b>hand</b> <b>holes</b> used for handling ergonomics and extending shelf life for perishables with good air flow. Based on experimental data, results show that the loss in strength can range between 10 to 40 % and is significantly larger than previously reported...|$|R

50|$|A forked {{fingering}} is a fingering {{in which}} an open <b>hole</b> has <b>covered</b> <b>holes</b> below it: fingerings for which the uncovering of the holes is not sequential. For example, the fingering 0123 is not a forked fingering, while 0123 56 is a forked fingering because the open hole 4 has <b>holes</b> <b>covered</b> below it - holes 5 and 6. Forked fingerings allow for smaller adjustments in pitch than the sequential uncovering of holes alone would allow. For example, at the same air speed the fingering 0123 5 sounds higher than 01234 but lower than 0123. Many standard recorder fingerings are forked fingerings. Forked fingerings may {{also be used to}} produced microtonal variations in pitch.|$|R

40|$|Alloy steel {{materials}} are predominantly {{used in the}} manufacturing of headers in thermal power plant boilers. Generally the <b>hand</b> <b>hole</b> pipe and dish end component are provided in the header for the inspecting the inner surface of the header. Conventionally the welding of dish end with <b>hand</b> <b>hole</b> pipe of the header is carried out using manual GTAW welding process for root pass and manual SAW welding process for filler passes which is a time consuming process. Thus it is substituted with a semi-automatic welding process i. e., STT- root pass followed by the pulsed GMAW for filler passes through a newly designed welding positioner. This semi-automatic welding process optimizes the cycle time and increases the productivity rate. Also the new welding process – STT and P-GMAW is established by following optimization technique of Taguchi’s orthogonal array method and ensuring the weld quality performance through X-Radiography, mechanical tests impact test and hardness test.
