He also says that, [...] "though the climax is still emotionally powerful, it comes over as overcooked." [...] A mixed review from Mid-Day [...] says [...] "Pradeep Sarkar weaves the story like magic, {{especially in the}} first half... excelling in the detailing... the vintage look of the film (that stood out) with authentic costumes, props and the roads of Kolkata". However, the review criticised the film's climax terming it as amateur, thereby diluting the whole film's impact. Another such review came from The Hindu which begins by saying [...] "A simple enough story, but Sarkar tells it well, with some great shots of Shekhar and Lalita together." [...] The review eventually says [...] "Except for the end... where it <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> bear." ...|$|E

60|$|This <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> borne, and Frank rode up {{red with}} passion; {{and a lot}} of others, {{including}} the whipper, soon followed.|$|R
60|$|Muf. Thou say'st true, a very {{considerable}} sum: {{he shall}} not die, {{though he had}} committed folly with a slave; it <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> lose by him.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{am afraid}} not," [...] replied Compton. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> expect of him, but I {{believe that in}} another year {{he will be able}} to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think,' he said, angrily, {{trying for}} dignity, though bewrayed by his restless eyes and hands--'I think it <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> accuse me of--of--when I never said--What word did I ever give?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> {{hope for}} any one, John," [...] said the Mistress, {{as they turned}} to go up into the garden; but in her heart she had the very same hope.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, but who could? Whether {{they have}} a right or not to publish the poetical side of their married life, it <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> ask them to give you the unpoetical also." ...|$|E
50|$|During the 1994 summer {{transfer}} window, Real brass {{decided that}} his physical fragility and injuries <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> deal with and offloaded him to Real Oviedo.|$|R
6000|$|VALENTINE. Thank you, I'm used to them. Would it <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> {{ask you to}} wait {{five minutes}} while I get rid of my {{landlord}} downstairs? ...|$|R
50|$|Upon {{its opening}} in 1998, {{the museum was}} run {{completely}} by volunteers. However, the 5,000 visitors received that year <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> handled solely by volunteers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't wonder," [...] said Considine; [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> {{expect a}} black fellow smarting under the sjambok to forgive {{the man who}} applies it-- {{especially}} when it is applied unjustly, and with savage cruelty." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> hope. This {{is not a}} {{question}} of casting incense on an altar; it is a matter of a changed spirit and a new life. Oh! have done. Why do you play with me?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, if {{you must}} have it so--I will take a small reward--just to satisfy your scruples. Let me see--why these notes are all hundreds--bless my soul! a hundred <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> take--fifty would be quite enough, I am sure-- ...|$|E
60|$|C. Yes, I {{know you}} care for it. You were bred up here, and know nothing better, poor old Mamsey, and pottering suits you exactly; but it <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> ask me to {{sacrifice}} my wider fields of culture and usefulness.|$|E
