5|$|Between 1870 and 1873, chemist and {{physicist}} William Crookes conducted {{experiments to}} determine {{the validity of the}} phenomena produced by three mediums: Florence Cook, Kate Fox, and Home. Crookes' final report in 1874 concluded that the phenomena produced by all three mediums were genuine, a result which was roundly derided by the scientific establishment. Crookes recorded that he controlled and secured Home by placing his feet on the top of Home's feet. Crooke's method of <b>foot</b> <b>control</b> later proved inadequate when used with Eusapia Palladino, as she merely slipped her foot out and into her sturdy shoe. In addition, Crookes' motives, methods, and conclusions with regard to Florence Cook were called into question, both at the time and subsequently, casting doubt on his conclusions about Home. In a series of experiments in London at the house of Crookes in February 1875, the medium Anna Eva Fay managed to fool Crookes into believing she had genuine psychic powers. Fay later confessed to her fraud and revealed the tricks she had used.|$|E
25|$|Microdebrider: The microdebrider is a powered rotary shaving {{device with}} {{continuous}} suction often used during sinus surgery. It {{is made up}} of a cannula or tube, connected to a hand piece, which in turn is connected to a motor with <b>foot</b> <b>control</b> and a suction device. The endoscopic microdebrider is used in performing a partial tonsillectomy, by partially shaving the tonsils. This procedure entails eliminating the obstructive portion of the tonsil while preserving the tonsillar capsule. A natural biologic dressing is left in place over the pharyngeal muscles, preventing injury, inflammation, and infection. The procedure results in less post-operative pain, a more rapid recovery, and perhaps fewer delayed complications. However, the partial tonsillectomy is suggested for enlarged tonsils – not those that incur repeated infections.|$|E
500|$|Track signals {{were based}} on two designs—station signals on posts, each post with two {{moveable}} arms—and portable signals; flags were used by day, and coloured lanterns at night. [...] The signals on posts were patented semaphore designs from J Stevens & Son. [...] Each post had two arms—linked by chain to a <b>foot</b> <b>control</b> at the base—which were used to alert drivers on both {{the up and down}} lines. [...] Each <b>foot</b> <b>control</b> was held in place by a hook on the post. [...] An arm set at an angle would indicate that the train should approach slowly, before stopping at the station. [...] The same arm set vertically (and out of sight) would indicate that the train could pass through without stopping. [...] The posts were also illuminated to allow use at night. [...] Signals at Accrington station were more complex, linked to the station building with wires, and by default set at 'stop' when released. [...] The coloured lanterns used as portable signals were painted red on one side (stop), green on another (go slowly), and clear on the third (proceed).|$|E

The landing gear was made from steel tubes with hickory wood inserts. Control cables were routed through copper tubing.

Designed in the 1940s, the Ercoupe was built without rudder pedals. Instead, the rudder is interconnected with the ailerons through the yoke. This unique design allows Cox {{to control the}} airplane with one <b>foot</b> <b>controlling</b> the yoke while the other <b>foot</b> <b>controls</b> the throttle.|$|R
2500|$|Surface {{dry suits}} may have socks or ankle seals fitted. Socks are {{normally}} made from latex rubber {{or from a}} breathable material similar {{to the rest of}} the suit. An outer boot or shoe would normally be worn over these socks to protect them from wear and the risk of puncture. The outer boot also provides more warmth than the thin layer of latex. A regular sock (e.g. a woollen sock) would normally be worn inside the drysuit sock for comfort. Latex rubber ankle seals are sometimes fitted in place of socks and can allow better <b>foot</b> <b>control</b> of water skis and surfboards. Survival suits may have neoprene socks of the same material as the suit, with tougher soles and ankle ties to keep them on the feet, as the [...] "one-size fits all" [...] socks must be too big for most users.|$|E
2500|$|The actual {{engraving}} {{is traditionally}} {{done by a}} combination of pressure and manipulating the work-piece. The traditional [...] "hand push" [...] process is still practiced today, but modern technology has brought various mechanically assisted engraving systems. Most pneumatic engraving systems require an air source that drives air through a hose into a handpiece, which resembles a traditional engraving handle in many cases, that powers a mechanism (usually a piston). The air is actuated by either a <b>foot</b> <b>control</b> (like a gas pedal or sewing machine) or newer palm / hand control. This mechanism replaces either the [...] "hand push" [...] effort or the effects of a hammer. The internal mechanisms move at speeds up to 15,000 strokes per minute, thereby greatly reducing the effort needed in traditional hand engraving. These types of pneumatic systems are used for power assistance only and do not guide or control the engraving artist. One of the major benefits of using a pneumatic system for hand engraving is the reduction of fatigue and decrease in time spent working.|$|E

5000|$|Foot-control: on/off {{and speed}} {{controls}} are foot-operated, and {{built into a}} pedal that also controls the steering mechanism. Steering may be via electronically controlled servo motors, or in early-model (and late-model low-end units), a push-pull cable. <b>Foot</b> <b>controlled</b> trolling motors require a specialized mounting bracket that bolts horizontally to the deck. Main advantage of <b>foot</b> <b>controls</b> is that fisherman has both hands free for fishing and landing the hooked fish. On the other hand, it is sometimes hard to coordinate foot work with hands, especially in wavy and windy conditions.|$|R

GarageBand has no functions for changing time signature mid-song though the software does now allow a tempo track to automate tempo changes. The ability to reverse tracks is also not available.|$|E
5000|$|Speed Bar: A kind of <b>foot</b> <b>control</b> {{called the}} [...] "speed bar" [...] (also [...] "accelerator") {{attaches}} to the paragliding harness and connects to {{the leading edge of}} the paraglider wing, usually through a system of at least two pulleys (see animation in margin).

The team on defense attempts to prevent the attacker from directing the ball into their court: players at the net jump and reach above the top (and across the plane) of the net in order to block the attacked ball. If the ball is hit around, above, or through the block, the defensive players arranged {{in the rest of the}} court attempt to control the ball with a dig (usually a forearm pass of a hard-driven ball, or a <b>foot</b> <b>control).</b> After a successful dig, the team transitions to offense.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} visual feedback effects and human performance in the <b>foot</b> mouse <b>control.</b> Background: Generally, computer mouse tasks are controlled by visual feedback. In order to understand the characteristics of a <b>foot</b> mouse <b>control,</b> it is important to investigate the patterns of visual feedback involved in foot-mouse control tasks. Human performance of <b>foot</b> mouse <b>control</b> is also an important factor to understand the <b>foot</b> mouse <b>control.</b> Method: Three types of mouse control were determined to investigate visual feedback effects and human performance in the <b>foot</b> mouse <b>control.</b> Visual feedback effects in the <b>foot</b> mouse <b>control</b> were compared with those of a typical hand mouse. The cursor movement speed and mental workload were measured in the three types of tasks and two types of mouses. Results: Mouse control tasks with an element of homing-in to the target were more quickly performed by the hand mouse than the foot mouse. Mental workload was also higher in the foot mouse than the hand mouse. However, in the steering movement, human performance of the <b>foot</b> mouse <b>control</b> was not lower than that of the hand mouse control. Visual feedback in the <b>foot</b> mouse <b>control</b> was less required than in the hand mouse <b>control.</b> Conclusion: The <b>foot</b> mouse was not efficient in the most mouse control tasks, compared to the hand mouse.
