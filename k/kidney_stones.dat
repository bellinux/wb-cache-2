Rosela flower (Hibiscus Sabdariffa L.) is one of plants {{that can be used}} to drop <b>kidney</b> <b>stone.</b> This research has aimed to know ethanol extract, water fraction and ethyl acetate fraction capability in dissolving <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> in vitro. Rosela flower was extracted by ethanol 70 % in soxhlet. Ethanol extract obtained was fractionated by ethyl acetate and water, so it was obtained ethanol extract, water fraction, and ethyl acetate fraction. Identification of flavonoid content in rosela flower was done by thin layer chromatografi. Qualitative analysis of <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> was done by infra red spectrophotometer to know that there was calcium in <b>kidney</b> <b>stone.</b> Calcium <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> was submerged in extract ethanol, water fraction and ethyl acetate fraction for 6 hours, at temperature 37 °C and at concentration 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 % v/v.

5|$|According to a DJ Premier fan blog, The Source's {{website and}} other sites, DJ Kool Herc fell gravely ill in early 2011 and {{was said to}} lack health insurance.

The hospital {{said it would not}} turn away uninsured patients in the emergency room. DJ Kool Herc and his family set up an official website on which he describes his medical issue and the larger goal of establishing the DJ Kool Herc Fund to pioneer long-term health care solutions. In April 2013, Campbell recovered from surgery and moved into post-medical care.|$|E
40|$|Objectives : Melamine {{was known}} as a new risk for <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> due to recent incidences of milk powder {{contamination}} in China. Here, we performed a retrospective study to investigate whether age, gender, and urinary pH affect melamine-associated <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> risk. Materials and Methods : A retrospective review was performed of 217 children aged less than 3 years old. All children had a history of being fed with Sanlu milk powder contaminated by melamine, and underwent a clinical screening on <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> in Shenyang from November 2008 to February 2009. A comparison with the Chi-square was conducted between 83 cases and 125 normal subjects. The difference between children′s gender, age, and urinary pH was evaluated. Results : A total of 208 subjects, 136 boys and 72 girls, were included in the study. Significant association was observed between melamine-associated <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> risk and gender [odds ratio (OR), 2. 03; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 11 - 3. 74; P= 0. 02] and urinary pH (OR, 1. 78; 95 % CI, 1. 01 - 3. 11; P= 0. 04), respectively. Male children were at about twofold increased melamine-associated <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> risk compared with female children. Acidic urine showed about 1. 78 -fold increased melamine-associated <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> risk compared with normal urine.

5|$|Another {{difference}} between older and newer studies {{is that the}} type of patients treated with the ketogenic diet has changed over time. When first developed and used, the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment protocol has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged fast, designed to lose 5–10% body weight, and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions. Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and <b>kidney</b> <b>stones,</b> and is no longer considered beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Febuxostat is {{typically}} only recommended {{in those who}} cannot tolerate allopurinol. Probenecid appears to be less effective than allopurinol and is a second line agent. Probenecid may be used if undersecretion of uric acid is present (24-hour urine uric acid less than 800mg). It is, however, not recommended if a person {{has a history of}} <b>kidney</b> <b>stones.</b> Pegloticase is an option for the 3% of people who are intolerant to other medications. It is a third line agent. Pegloticase is administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks, and reduces uric acid levels. Pegloticase is useful decreasing tophi but has a high rate of side effects and many people develop resistance to it. In 2016 it was withdrawn from the European market.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to {{classify}} low back pain with no consensus that any one method is best. There are three general types of low back pain by cause: mechanical back pain (including nonspecific musculoskeletal strains, herniated discs, compressed nerve roots, degenerative discs or joint disease, and broken vertebra), non-mechanical back pain (tumors, inflammatory conditions such as spondyloarthritis, and infections), and referred pain from internal organs (gallbladder disease, <b>kidney</b> <b>stones,</b> kidney infections, and aortic aneurysm, among others). Mechanical or musculoskeletal problems underlie most cases (around 90% or more), and of those, most (around 75%) do not have a specific cause identified, but are thought to be due to muscle strain or injury to ligaments. Rarely, complaints of low back pain result from systemic or psychological problems, such as fibromyalgia and somatoform disorders.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{correlates of}} <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> disease {{in white and}} African American {{men and women in}} a population-based longitudinal study starting in four US communities, and to assess differences in correlates across racial groups. Methods: Between 1993 and 1995, 12, 161 middle-aged participants of the ARIC Study provided information on history of <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> disease. Information on incident kidney stone-related hospitalizations was obtained from ICD codes on hospital discharge records. Results: <b>Kidney</b> <b>stone</b> disease was reported by 12. 0 % of men and 4. 8 % of women. After multivariable adjustment, prevalent <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> disease was significantly (p< 0. 05) associated with male gender (PR. = 2. 50), increased serum triglycerides (PR. = 1. 07 per SD increase), diabetes (PR. = 1. 27), gallstone disease (PR. = 1. 54), white race (PR. = 1. 67), and region of residence. Male gender (HR. = 1. 70), diabetes (HR. = 1. 98), and hypertension (HR. = 1. 69) were significantly associated (p< 0. 05) with incident kidney stone-related hospitalizations (n= 94). Race-stratified analyses showed stronger associations of prevalent <b>kidney</b> <b>stone</b> disease with increased triglycerides, older age, and gallstone disease in African Americans compared to whites, whereas male gender showed stronger association in whites (all p-interaction < 0. 05).
