5000|$|Starting with John and Doug's {{source code}} for PCPaint, the {{painting}} aspects were chopped out andinstead a simple font editor for Doug's slideshow program <b>FlashGun</b> was created. The graphics library {{was used to}} make a simple script playback that had a command for each graphics library function. It also originally used the assembly language fades from <b>FlashGun</b> fora [...] "FADE" [...] command, but those image fade routines were mode specific (CGA) and difficult to enhance. The routines were rewritten along with the script parts. It stored all the files in a ZIB archive, renaming John Bridges' program ZIB to GLIB and the archives it produced were GL files.|$|E
50|$|Similar to the Kodak Brownie Starlet, the Starflash {{features}} an integrated <b>flashgun</b> accepting M-2 style flashbulbs, {{as well as}} M-5 and M-25 bulbs for longer range photos. The viewfinder is slightly smaller to accommodate the large parabolic reflector.|$|E

5000|$|Nikon popularised many {{features}} in professional SLR photography, {{such as the}} modular camera system with interchangeable lenses, viewfinders, motor drives, and data backs; integrated light metering and lens indexing; electronic strobe <b>flashguns</b> instead of expendable flashbulbs; electronic shutter control; evaluative multi-zone [...] "matrix" [...] metering; and built-in motorized film advance. However, as autofocus SLRs became available from Minolta {{and others in the}} mid-1980s, Nikon's line of manual-focus cameras began to seem out of date.|$|R
500|$|Frazer [...] "Frazz" [...] Davis (Mmoloki Chrystie) {{is one of}} Spike's co-delinquents {{forced into}} working on the paper, his initial main task writing the horoscopes. Frazz is {{initially}} portrayed as [...] "intellectually challenged", such as not understanding the synonymous relationship between [...] "the astrology column" [...] and the horoscopes. Later episodes, however, show him to be devious, such as in [...] "The Last Word: Part 2" [...] when he stuns the gunman using a large array of <b>flashguns.</b>|$|R

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from BCRA via the URL in this record. White LEDs are {{increasingly}} being used as sources of illumination for cave photography, both as modelling lamps and as alternatives to <b>flashguns.</b> Clearly, a simple way to determine the effectiveness of such illumination - the guide number - is to calibrate the light source in a series of practical tests. However, we can also determine the guide number theoretically. David Gibson goes through the steps in this exercise, which brings together several aspects of physics and photometry that the reader may have forgotten...|$|R
50|$|The Minolta 7000 was {{the first}} {{successful}} auto focus SLR using a motor integrated in the camera body.It was released in 1985 together with 11 lenses, 2 <b>flashguns</b> and a complete lineup of accessories.The 7000 featured one AF-sensor, shutter speeds of 1/2000 to 30 seconds, flash sync speed of 1/100s, exposure compensation of +/-4EV in 0.5 exposure steps, center-weighted lightmetering and two frames per second film advance. The Maxxum 7000, when first released had the crossed x's in the name Maxxum. Exxon had a registered trademark for the crossed x's and sued Minolta, forcing Minolta {{to change the way}} the name was shown.|$|R

5000|$|The Swinger {{featured}} an extinction {{exposure meter}} {{tied to the}} aperture which displayed the word [...] "YES" [...] in a window below the viewfinder when the exposure was set correctly. Earlier models also displayed the word [...] "NO" [...] when not properly adjusted, while later units used only the YES indicator. The Swinger also included a built-in <b>flashgun</b> for AG-1 flashbulbs.|$|E
50|$|Atkinson, Campbell, and Francis {{demonstrated}} that visual afterimages could {{be employed in}} order to achieve similar results. Using a <b>flashgun</b> to illuminate a line of white disks, they were able to generate intense afterimages in dark-adapted observers. Observers were required to verbally report how many disks had been presented, both at 10 s and at 60 s after the <b>flashgun</b> exposure. Observers reported being able to see all the disks presented for at least 10 s, and being able to perceive {{at least some of the}} disks after 60 s. Despite a long period of time to enumerate the number of disks presented when the number of disks presented fell outside the subitizing range (i.e., 5-12 disks), observers made consistent enumeration errors in both the 10 s and 60 s conditions. In contrast, no errors occurred within the subitizing range (i.e., 1-4 disks), in either the 10 s or 60 s conditions.|$|E
50|$|Parr's first publications, Bad Weather, {{published}} in 1982 by Zwemmer with an Arts Council subsidy, Calderdale Photographs (1984) and A Fair Day: Photographs from the West Coast of Ireland (1984), all featured photographs from mostly northern England, and Ireland, in black-and-white. He used a Leica M3 with a 35 mm lens; although for Bad Weather he quickly switched to an underwater camera with a <b>flashgun.</b>|$|E
50|$|The lineup {{was soon}} {{expanded}} to include a variety of models from the basic but popular 100/104 to the automatic exposure 800/804, which featured an aluminum chassis, rangefinder, selenium light meter, and clockwork spring wind. (The 100/104 designation refers {{to the type of}} flash: models ending in 0 had a built-in <b>flashgun,</b> while those ending in 4 used flashcubes.) The top-of-the-line model was the Instamatic Reflex SLR, which was made in Germany and could accept a variety of Retina S-mount lenses.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{a normal}} camera, the iconograph {{contains}} a tiny imp who quickly paints the pictures (also called iconographs) {{of the subject}} at hand. If it is too dim for the imps to see, salamanders {{can be used as}} a <b>flashgun.</b> The iconograph is first seen in The Colour of Magic, where it is used by Twoflower, the Discworld's first tourist, to the bemusement of most other characters. By the time of later books in the series, they have also become very popular in Ankh-Morpork.|$|E
5000|$|Wells and Cooper shoot {{through the}} floor upstairs to elude the werewolves, {{dropping}} into the kitchen, where they find Spoon's remains. Wells orders Cooper to take shelter in the cellar as he begins to transform into a werewolf, giving him a roll of photographic film (which was in a <b>flashgun</b> camera used to stun the werewolves) to prove what has happened. The werewolves break {{into the kitchen and}} confront Wells as he cuts a gas line and blows up the house, killing himself and the werewolves.|$|E
50|$|The G series offers {{features}} {{such as the use}} of a lithium-ion battery, full manual exposure control, an articulated LCD screen (G7, G9, G10, G15, and G16 have a fixed screen), Raw image format capture (all models except G7), a lens with a wider maximum aperture than standard PowerShot models, remote capture (except G11), and faster image processing. The range also includes a hot shoe (except G7X) for an external <b>flashgun,</b> including Canon's EX range. Three models in the series have larger sensors than most other point-and-shoot cameras (G1X, G1X Mark II, G7X).|$|E
50|$|On July 7, 1943, the CBS Radio Network {{launched}} the long-running radio series called Casey, Crime Photographer, (originally called <b>Flashgun</b> Casey). The show was very successful. It was renamed in April 1944 to Casey, Press Photographer, {{and again in}} June 1945 to Crime Photographer. It was finally called Casey, Crime Photographer in March 1947. The radio series was cancelled on November 16, 1950. It was revived and put back on the radio as simply Crime Photographer. It was only on for a year from January 13, 1954 - April 22, 1955 before being permanently cancelled.|$|E
5000|$|Garrett {{caught the}} {{attention}} of the public eye after the 2006 publication of his book King Lear of the Taxi. Poems from Garrett's book were used as text in the short film Taxi Driver - King Lear of the Taxi by director Ray Andrew Wilkes of <b>Flashgun</b> Films, Keele, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, UK. [...] Garrett provided the voice-over (recorded in a studio in NYC) to accompany footage of British cab drivers in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. The film was a response to media reports of increased violence against cab drivers in the West Midlands and was screened at London's Portobello Film Festival in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Casey, Crime Photographer (aka Crime {{photographer}}; <b>Flashgun</b> Casey; Casey, Press Photographer; Stephen Bristol, Crime Photographer) was a media franchise, in the 1930s {{until the}} 1960s. Created by George Harmon Coxe, the photographer Casey {{was featured in}} radio, film, theater, novels, magazines and comic books.Launched in a 1934 issue of the pulp magazine Black Mask, the character Jack [...] "Flashgun" [...] Casey, was a crime photographer for the newspaper The Morning Express. With the help of reporter Ann Williams (portrayed on radio and TV by Jan Miner), he solved crimes and recounted his stories to friends at The Blue Note, their favorite tavern.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of the photography for which Cohen is known is shot in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre metropolitan area (also known as the Wyoming Valley), a historic industrialized region of northeastern Pennsylvania. Characteristically Cohen photographs people close-up, using a wide-angle lens and a <b>flashgun,</b> mostly in black and white, frequently cropping their heads from the frame, concentrating on small details. He has used 21 mm, 28 mm and 35 mm focal length, wide-angle, lenses and later on 50 mm. Cohen has described his method as 'intrusive'; [...] "They're not easy pictures. But I guess that's why they're mine." ...|$|E
5000|$|The lead {{designer}} for the Instamatic program was Dean M. Peterson, also later known {{for most of}} the innovations in the point-and-shoot camera revolution of the 1980s. The first Instamatic to be released was the Instamatic 50, which appeared in the UK in February 1963, about a month before the 100. The first model released in the US was the basic Instamatic 100. With fixed shutter speed of 1/90th of a second, aperture and focus, it continued in the tradition of Kodak's earlier Brownie cameras, providing a simple snapshot camera anyone could use. It also featured a built-in <b>flashgun</b> for AG-1 [...] "peanut" [...] bulbs, a feature lacking in the 50.|$|E
50|$|He {{kept his}} {{equipment}} {{in the trunk of}} his car. In addition to cameras and tripods, he had a machete, shovel, child’s white parasol, bee smoker, compass, toilet paper, and galoshes and old shoes for swamp jobs. The machete and shovel were used to cut down or remove anything from weeds to saplings that {{got in the way of}} his camera angle. The parasol, spotted and stained, replaced the usual <b>flashgun</b> reflector when he needed a softer light. The compass helped him figure his lighting when he was caught in strange territory without sunlight. The bee smoker provided wisps of smoke to create mood or hide a distracting element. Toilet paper was wrapped around flash bulbs to get a diffused light.|$|E
50|$|Today, certain modern xenon flash {{units have}} the ability to produce a longer-duration flash to permit flash {{synchronization}} at shorter shutter speeds, therefore called high-speed sync (HSS). Instead of delivering one burst of light, the units deliver several smaller bursts over a time interval as short as 1/125 of a second. This allows light to be delivered to the entire area of the film or image sensor even though the shutter is never fully open at any moment, similar to FP sync. The downside is that the flash is of less effective intensity since the individual bursts are lower powered than the normal capability of the flash unit. Only certain camera and flash combinations support this feature, and the camera-flash pairings are almost exclusively from the same manufacturer, the first being the Olympus OM-4 with the F280 <b>flashgun.</b> Wireless remote flash triggers with these features are becoming more common.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} uses a high-powered, hand-held, computer-controlled <b>flashgun</b> {{to deliver}} an intense, visible, broad-spectrum pulse of light, generally in the visible spectral range of 400 to 1200 nm. Various cutoff filters {{are commonly used}} to selectively filter out lower wavelengths, especially potentially damaging ultra violet light. The resulting light has a spectral range that targets specific structures and chromophores (e.g. melanin in hair, or oxyhemoglobin in blood vessels) that are heated to destruction and reabsorbed by the body. IPL shares some similarities with laser treatments, in that they both use light to heat and destroy their targets. But unlike lasers that use a single wavelength (color) of light which typically matches only one chromophore, and hence only one condition, IPL uses a broad spectrum that when used with filters, allows it to be used against several conditions. This can be achieved when the IPL technician selects the appropriate filter that matches a specific chromophore.|$|E
