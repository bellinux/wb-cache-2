The additions marked {{a departure from the}} operating system's original concept of a single browser with tabs and gave Chrome OS {{the look and feel of}} a more conventional desktop operating system. [...] "In a way, this almost feels as if Google is admitting defeat here", wrote Frederic Lardinois on TechCrunch. He argued that Google had traded its original version of simplicity for greater functionality. [...] "That’s not necessarily a bad thing, though, and may <b>just</b> <b>help</b> Chrome OS gain more mainstream acceptance as new users will surely find it to be a more familiar experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Enchanted Forest, Prince Henry {{is trying}} to {{convince}} his daughter, Regina, still after Snow White's heart, to give up vengeance, but she is unable {{to let go of}} her anger. He turns to the Magic Mirror in desperation to speak with Cora, believing {{that the best way to}} force Regina to get over Snow White is to <b>just</b> <b>help</b> her complete her plot, which Prince Henry is not in favor of. Unknown to Prince Henry and Regina, Cora has managed to enter the realm of the Enchanted Forest through the mirror again. Later on, Prince Henry meets with Snow White in the woods. When she sees the real Prince Henry approaching her, she realizes that the first Prince Henry was actually Cora, who rips out her heart while she is distracted. Cora takes Snow's heart to Regina as a birthday present, only to then learn that Snow switched it out with that of a guard. It turned out that Prince Henry saved Snow White by switching the hearts. A furious Regina then shrinks her father and condemns him into the very box that was holding the heart. Regina confronts Cora and sends her mother back into the mirror and seals it forever. [...] At the last minute Cora takes the box containing her husband so Regina will be truly alone.|$|E

His happiness was only in the sight and touch of her. But that, God knew, was happiness enough--a feverish, craving joy, like an overtired man's thirst, growing with the drink on which it tries to slake itself. Sitting there, in the scent of those flowers and of some sweet essence in her hair, with her fingers touching his, and her eyes seeking his, he tried loyally not to think of himself, to grasp her sensations at this her first dance, and <b>just</b> <b>help</b> her to enjoyment. But he could not--paralyzed, made drunk by that insensate longing to take her in his arms and crush her to him as he had those few hours back. He could see her expanding like a flower, in all this light, and motion, and intoxicating admiration round her. What business had he in her life, with his dark hunger after secret hours; he--a coin worn thin already--a destroyer of the freshness and the glamour of her youth and beauty! ...|$|E
