5|$|Most {{people of}} the {{district}} follow the traditions, customs and rituals. The district has many temples of Hindu gods and goddesses, which are ancient and have deep spiritualism attached to them. The people of Dakshina Kannada worship the serpent god Subramanya. According to legend, the district was reclaimed by Parashurama from the sea. Nagaradhane or snake worship is practiced according to the popular belief of the Naga Devatha to go underground and guard the species on the top. Rituals such as Bhuta Kola are performed to satisfy the spirits. <b>Kambala,</b> a form of buffalo race on muddy track in the paddy field, is organised in the 16 sites across the district. Cock fight (Kori Katta in Tulu) is another past time of the rural agrarian people.|$|E
5000|$|In 1913, with an {{enrolment}} {{of nearly}} fifty, the School moved again, to its present site in New South Head Road, Rose Bay.

The spacious new building was built in 1841, and the notable architect John Horbury Hunt was commissioned to extend it. Today this building houses <b>Kambala's</b> boarders in Years 7 to 10.|$|R
5000|$|Taking clue from Yaska's Nirukta, S. Levi {{states that}} [...] "the Kambhojas were {{a branch of}} the Bhojas and were {{not a part of the}} Aryans (i.e Indo Aryans)". The name [...] "Kambhojas" [...] is etymologised as Kamblala + Bhojas ("the Bhojas with <b>Kambalas</b> or blankets") as well as Kamniya + Bhojas (meaning [...] "The {{handsome}} Bhojas or the desirable Bhojas"). Thus, Levi and others have connected the ancient Bhojas with the Kambhojas. Both Kambojas and the Bhojas are also referred to as north-western people in the 13th Rock Edict of king Asoka. Thus, the Kambojas appear to have either been anciently and inadvertently confused with the Bhojas who were a Yadava tribe, or, else, there was indeed some kind of link between the Bhojas and the ancient Kambhojas as S. Levi suggests. Writers like James F. K. Hewitt and others also connect the Sivis, Bhojas and the Drhuyus with the Kambhojas. The Chinese evidence on king Sivi as well as king Vessantara (Sudana, Saniraja or Pi-lo of the Chinese records), the rulers of Oddiyana (in pre-Buddhist times) also seems to lend a fair credence in this direction.|$|R
