500|$|The cartooning is far looser than in Brown's earlier work, and {{concerned}} more with gesture and expression than literal detail. They are rendered with a brush, and amongst {{the simplest and}} sparsest in his body of work. There is nonetheless {{a significant amount of}} hatching, and the backgrounds are naturalistic, in contrast to the thin, distorted figures. [...] Brown had been paring his artwork since the Playboy stories, as he was not happy with his style and sought [...] "to rebuild [...] style in a way that [...] would like". [...] He continued this with I Never Liked You, where he has said he was [...] "trying to <b>get</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> pared down than The Playboy". [...] Certain inanimate objects receive a focus imbuing them with special significance, such as Chet's habitual after-school package of soda crackers or the Brown family home—a house that, to reviewer Darcy Sullivan, [...] "is as much a character [...] as in The Playboy".|$|E
500|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of Carmella's relationship with Oliver, Blair commented that Oliver would [...] "always have {{a special place in}} Carmella's heart". Although Carmella began dating Marco, Blair felt that Chloe's premature birth strengthened the connection between Carmella and Oliver. She explained that Carmella [...] "feels desolate and suddenly the connection Carmella's always had with Oliver is heightened. Together they name their baby Chloe and it's Marco who feels shut out." [...] Following Chloe's birth, Carmella decided to put her love life to one side, and put her baby daughter first. She told Marco she did not want him in her life; he planned to leave town without a word to her, except a love note and a present to Chloe. Discussing the state of her relationship with Oliver and Marco at this point, Blair assessed: [...] "I don't think it's so much of a love triangle anymore. Oliver made his feelings for Carmella very clear - he doesn't love her in that way. But he still doesn't want another man looking after his child. So there'll be more tension between the [...] of them. And things <b>get</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> complicated over the next few months." ...|$|E
