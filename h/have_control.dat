5|$|Adult {{cartoonist}} Antonucci conceived Ed, Edd n Eddy {{while working}} on a commercial design. Antonucci pitched the series to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon. Both studios {{were interested in the}} series, but each demanded creative control and Antonucci refused. Cartoon Network ended up commissioning the show after agreeing to let Antonucci <b>have</b> <b>control</b> of the show. After its debut, the series was a success in Nielsen ratings, popular among younger and older viewers. Met with generally positive reviews, the season earned Antonucci a Reuben Award for Best Television Animation.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano {{tried to}} promote the {{diversification}} of agriculture via the production of linen and hemp, following experiences with his friend Martín de Altolaguirre. He proposed to keep reserves of wheat to help <b>have</b> <b>control</b> over its price. He also tried to make leather recognised {{as a product of}} the country, in order to promote its commercial potential. None of these proposals were accepted. He designed a system to give prizes to achievements that would boost the local economy, diversify the agriculture, or deforest the pampas. The system did not work as expected, and as nobody met the requirements no such prize was ever given.|$|E

5|$|If Offa did {{not gain}} the {{advantage}} in Wessex until defeating Cynewulf in 779, {{it may be}} that his successes south of the river were a necessary prerequisite to his interventions in the southeast. In this view, Egbert of Kent's death in about 784 and Cynewulf's death in 786 were the events that allowed Offa to gain control of Kent and bring Beorhtric into his sphere of influence. This version of events also assumes that Offa did not <b>have</b> <b>control</b> of Kent after 764–65, as some historians believe.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had not had}} any mechanical {{or technical}} errors or problems prior to take-off. The turbulence and wind shear caused a crack in either the tail rudder, the tailplane, or both. This was caused by strong winds acting {{on both sides of}} the structure, due to shifting winds. These structural failures caused the aircraft to crash. Out of the 63 seconds from take-off to impact, the aircraft was under control for the first 55 seconds; only during the last 8 seconds did the crew not <b>have</b> <b>control</b> over the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Wider {{management}} failings {{were found}} by the investigation to {{have contributed to the}} explosion: management safety checks at the site were found to be deficient and not properly followed. Site staff did not <b>have</b> <b>control</b> over the flow rates and timing of two of the three inlet sources, meaning {{that they did not have}} enough information to properly manage the storage of incoming fuel. Further, overall throughput had increased, reducing wait times further and shifting the emphasis to process operations instead of process safety.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{a dispute}} between the Malays and the Bugis, the Johor-Riau Empire was split in 1819 with the {{mainland}} Johor Sultanate came {{under the control of}} Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim while the Riau-Lingga Sultanate came {{under the control of the}} Bugis. The Temenggong intended to create a new administration centre for the Johor Sultanate to create a dynasty under the entity of Temenggong. As the Temenggong already had a close relationship with the British and the British intended to <b>have</b> <b>control</b> over trade activities in Singapore, a treaty was signed between Sultan Ali and Temenggong Ibrahim in Singapore on 10 March 1855. According to the treaty, Ali would be crowned as the Sultan of Johor and receive $5,000 (in Spanish dollars) with an allowance of $500 per month. In return, Ali was required to cede the sovereignty of the territory of Johor (except Kesang of Muar which would be the only territory under his control) to Temenggong Ibrahim. When both sides agreed on Temenggong acquiring the territory, he renamed it Iskandar Puteri and began to administer it from Telok Blangah in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|During the game, players {{describe}} their PC's intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response. Trivial actions, such as {{picking up a}} letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions are determined by rolling dice. Factors contributing to the outcome include the character's ability scores, skills {{and the difficulty of}} the task. In circumstances where a character does not <b>have</b> <b>control</b> of an event, such as when a trap or magical effect is triggered or a spell is cast, a saving throw can be used to determine whether the resulting damage is reduced or avoided. In this case the odds of success are influenced by the character's class, levels and ability scores.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite their}} vulnerability, some women in rural Malawi {{believe that they}} do, to a certain extent, <b>have</b> <b>control</b> over their own health and well-being. They tell their husbands that the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} has made sexual infidelity extremely dangerous {{and encourage them to}} refrain from engaging in extramarital sexual contact. In addition, many women are convinced that, by appealing to the vulnerability of their children (who will probably be orphaned if their parents contract HIV), they can convince their husbands to use condoms consistently during extramarital sexual encounters. Other women seek support from their friends and family members when they believe that their husbands' unsafe behaviors are putting their lives at risk. Finally, as a last resort, women might warn their husbands that they will visit the ankhoswe, or traditional marriage counselor, and demand divorce if their husbands refuse to remain faithful and actively prevent the transmission of the disease.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, in {{collaboration}} with numerous companies, Microsoft created a home computer system, MSX, which contained {{its own version of}} the DOS operating system, called MSX-DOS; this became relatively popular in Japan, Europe and South America. Later, the market saw a flood of IBM PC clones after Columbia Data Products successfully cloned the IBM BIOS, quickly followed by Eagle Computer and Compaq. The deal with IBM allowed Microsoft to <b>have</b> <b>control</b> of its own QDOS derivative, MS-DOS, and through aggressive marketing of the operating system to manufacturers of IBM-PC clones Microsoft rose from a small player to one of the major software vendors in the home computer industry. With the release of the Microsoft Mouse on May 2, 1983, Microsoft continued to expand its product line in other markets. This expansion included Microsoft Press, a book publishing division, on July 11 the same year, which debuted with two titles: Exploring the IBM PCjr Home Computer by Peter Norton, and The Apple Macintosh Book by Cary Lu.|$|E
5|$|Matings are {{generally}} observed between March and May, {{but the most}} likely time of conception is April. Most mating {{takes place in the}} territories and during the day. Females <b>have</b> <b>control</b> over the copulation process, and males may have to keep mating with the same females. Females usually give birth to one young each year. Gestation lasts around 27 weeks, and pregnant females give birth between late September and November. Late births into January are sometimes observed. The altricial newborns rely on their mothers for warmth. For their first three weeks, young cling to their mothers when they go foraging. After this, the young remain in the roosts. By January, young are capable of sustained flight, and by February, March or April are fully weaned.|$|E
5|$|On a dare, Antonucci {{then decided}} that he would try {{producing}} a children's animated series of his own. While designing a commercial, he ended up drawing three characters that he felt particularly pleased with. Growing excited over their potential, he named them Ed, Edd, and Eddy and spent the following months developing a show around them. He faxed a one-page concept sheet to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon in 1996. Both studios quickly responded, Cartoon Network in only 20 minutes, and were enthusiastic and wanted to see more; they each demanded creative control, however, and Antonucci refused. After Cartoon Network agreed to let Antonucci <b>have</b> <b>control</b> of the show, conversations between Antonucci and the studio continued.|$|E

5|$|Priestley's friends, {{particularly}} other Rational Dissenters, {{urged him}} to publish a work on the injustices experienced by Dissenters; the result was his Essay on the First Principles of Government (1768). An early work of modern liberal political theory and Priestley's most thorough treatment of the subject, it—unusually for the time—distinguished political rights from civil rights with precision and argued for expansive civil rights. Priestley identified separate private and public spheres, contending {{that the government should}} only <b>have</b> <b>control</b> over the public sphere. Education and religion, in particular, he maintained, were matters of private conscience and should not be administered by the state. Priestley's later radicalism emerged from his belief that the British government was infringing upon these individual freedoms.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months later}} in Tokyo, Saya saves {{a girl named}} Mana Hiiragi from a berserk {{humanoid}} Elder Bairn. Mana and Saya are rescued by Mana's comrades in SIRRUT, a covert group resisting Fumito's group who heard about Saya's past through Itsuki Tomofusa, a spy who died following the experiment. The group is led by Fumito's relative Kuroto Mogari, whose family was killed so Fumito could <b>have</b> <b>control</b> over the Shrovetide. Kuroto offers Saya SIRRUT's aid finding Fumito in exchange for her help. Hunted by Tower, and after saving Mana from Youth Ordinance Bill enforcers, Saya agrees to help. Saya and Mana infiltrate a private academy funded by Fumito when {{he is scheduled to}} give a lecture. When Saya attacks, it is revealed to be a trap baited with a false version of Fumito, and she must fight off an Elder Bairn before they can escape. In the aftermath, Mana reveals that her father disappeared after she helped him with his research into Tower. Regaining her confidence as a hacker, Mana locates Tower's main base, allowing Saya to infiltrate the base.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453, Mehmed {{set his sights on}} other campaigns. In Anatolia, the Greek Empire of Trebizond was still {{resisting}} the Ottomans, and to the East the White Sheep Turkomans of Uzun Hasan, together with other smaller states, threatened the Ottomans. In the West, Skanderbeg in Albania continued to trouble the Sultan, while Bosnia was sometimes reluctant in paying the Jizya (tax on non-Muslims). Wallachia controlled the left bank of the Danube, and Mehmed wanted to <b>have</b> <b>control</b> over the river, as naval attacks could be launched against his empire {{all the way from the}} Holy Roman Empire. On September 26, 1459, Pope Pius II called for a new crusade against the Ottomans and on January 14, 1460, at the Congress of Mantua, the Pope proclaimed the official crusade that was to last for three years. His plan, however, failed and the only European leader that showed enthusiasm for the crusade was Vlad Ţepeş, whom the Pope held in high regard. Because of a lack of enthusiasm shown by Europeans for the crusade, Mehmed took the opportunity to take an offensive stand. Later that same year (1460), he captured the last independent Serbian city, Smederevo, and in 1461, he convinced the Greek despot of Morea to give up his stronghold; soon thereafter, its capital, Mistra, and Corinth followed suit and surrendered themselves without struggle.|$|E
