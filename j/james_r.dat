500|$|The {{extensive}} {{building and}} rebuilding of royal palaces probably began under <b>James</b> III (<b>r.</b> 1460–88), accelerated under <b>James</b> IV (<b>r.</b> 1488–1513) and {{reached its peak}} under <b>James</b> V (<b>r.</b> 1513–42).

Linlithgow was first constructed under <b>James</b> I (<b>r.</b> 1406–27), {{under the direction of}} master of work John de Waltoun and was referred to as a palace from 1429, apparently the first use of this term in the country. [...] It was extended under James III and resembled a quadrangular, corner-towered Italian signorial palace or palatium ad moden castri (a castle-style palace), combining classical symmetry with neo-chivalric imagery. There is evidence that Italian masons were employed by James IV, in whose reign Linlithgow was completed and other palaces were rebuilt with Italianate proportions.|$|R
