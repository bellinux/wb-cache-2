40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{determine}} whether the process of memorizing a tactile map key, or legend, can be improved by including three-dimensional (3 D) symbols produced by means of 3 D Printing. The method used in this study involved asking a group of 20 volunteers with different profiles to memorize eight <b>tactile</b> <b>symbols</b> from two keys, each of which had different characteristics: Key 2 <b>included</b> 3 D <b>tactile</b> <b>symbols</b> and Key 1 had only two-dimensional (2 D) <b>tactile</b> <b>symbols.</b> Results show statistically significant differences between the two keys. Use of Key 2 yielded a 48. 72 % reduction in the number of errors compared to Key 1 (N = 20, p-value =. 014). These data show that combining 3 D with flat relief symbols (2 D) improves the process of memorizing a tactile key because the 3 D attributes can be distinguished from the 2 D features by touch. For practitioners, this article provides data about the possibilities of 3 D Printing applied to tactile maps, keys, and symbols. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{output of}} mobile devices is {{primarily}} visual or auditive. However, {{this is not}} suitable in all usage contexts. External stimuli and concurrent tasks can hinder {{the perception of the}} presented information. A possible alternative are signals to be received over the skin. These can be designed to transmit <b>tactile</b> <b>symbols,</b> which represent semantic concepts. This dissertation examines the suitability of <b>tactile</b> <b>symbols</b> for notifications in truly mobile scenarios. The requirements for an according output interface are developed and the concept of a wrist-worn device is presented. The analysis of prior work reveals questions that have so far not been answered. These questions are treated in several experiments, employing a prototypical tactile output device. Results show that the <b>tactile</b> <b>symbols</b> were perceived even during typical mobile activities in real life outdoor environments. Most participants were able to learn the meaning of specific symbols in a short time span. They could further reliably remember them a week later. Moreover, <b>tactile</b> <b>symbols</b> can be designed in such a manner that their perception corresponds with specific feelings. Participants rated the presented approach as useful and not annoying for notifications in truly mobile scenarios.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} whether Blissymbolics have the potential for being developed into a <b>tactile</b> <b>symbol</b> communication system. <b>Tactile</b> techniques are used by many individuals with augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) needs. Tactile processing is optimized by the use of minimalistic stimuli, i. e., stimuli that do not contain superfluous material. Blissymbolics is a minimalist graphic symbol system that was originally developed for communication through visual means. In the present study, Blissymbols were modified to a form that could be sensed through touch. This modification consisted of raised-line renderings of Blissymbols made on thermal expansion paper. These raised-line representations were tactually minimalistic because of the stylistic simplicity of the Blissymbolic graphic image from which they were derived. Minimalism may be critical for tactile discernment of Blissymbols. A pilot test with raised-line Blissymbols found that it was possible to reliably discern Blissymbols from each other through haptic processing. This indicated that Blissymbolics may have the potential for serving as the foundation for the development of a <b>tactile</b> <b>symbol</b> system. The pilot test, however, was limited in the number of Blissymbols that were tested. Only four simple Blissymbols (sometimes referred to as Blissymbol elements) were tested. A more comprehensive examination of tactile discernment of Blissymbols is needed. ^ An objective of the following research was to develop and implement a protocol for a more comprehensive examination of the tactile discrimination of Blissymbols. The basis of Blissymbolics is a core of simple Blissymbols that can be combined to produce a multitude of compound symbols with meanings that differ from the simple symbols that comprise the compound. For a <b>tactile</b> <b>symbol</b> system based on Blissymbolics to be successful, it is critical for the simple Blissymbols to have the capacity to be tactilely discriminated from each other. The method for testing tactile discrimination was similar to that used in the pilot test. It entailed having participants tactilely exam a target Blissymbol and to correctly identify through tactile means a duplicate of the target from among foils consisting of tactile Blissymbols that differ from the target. ^ To determine whether Blissymbolics have the potential for a <b>tactile</b> <b>symbol</b> communication system, a criterion for was established. The criterion was that at least 80 % of the simple Blissymbols tested must have discrimination scores of 90 % correct or better. Eighty-four percent of the simple Blissymbols tested had discrimination scores of 90 % correct or better. Thus, Blissymbols exceed the established criterion and appear to have the potential for being developed into a <b>tactile</b> <b>symbol</b> system. Moreover, the total number of tactile discrimination trials was 1548. Of this total, the overall percentage of correct tactile discrimination responses was 94 %. This is a considerable number of discrimination trials with a very high percentage of correct responses and can be considered as corroborative to the above performance measures. ^ Identification of simple Blissymbols that are easily confused through tactile processing will be critical for developing a <b>tactile</b> <b>symbol</b> communication system. Symbols that are easily confused through haptic processing will not be viable in their present form for a tactile communication system. Another objective of the present study was the identification of potentially problematic simple Blissymbols. A total of 74 simple Blissymbols were tested. Of those 74 symbols, 4 were identified as statistical outliers because of their low tactile discrimination performance. These 4 symbols are not suitable candidates in their present form as tactile Blissymbols. An additional eight Blissymbols had discrimination performance of less than 90 % correct. The performance of these eight symbols was not sufficiently low enough for them to be statistical outliers but because they were below the 90 % criterion they should be consider as questionable in regards to their capacity to serve as a tactile Blissymbol. The four unsuitable and eight questionable symbols should be examined to determine appropriate remediation for use as <b>tactile</b> <b>symbols.</b> (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} the optimal elevation of <b>tactile</b> map <b>symbols.</b> Background: <b>Tactile</b> perception research predicts that symbol elevation (vertical height) and texture on tactile maps could influence their readability. However, while {{research has shown}} that elevation influences detection and discrimination thresholds for single tactile stimuli, and that the physiological response of fingertip receptors varies with texture, {{little is known about the}} influence of these parameters on the identification of stimuli in the context of multiple symbols as found on tactile maps. Method: Sighted and visually impaired participants performed <b>tactile</b> <b>symbol</b> identification tasks. In Experiment 1, we measured the effect of elevation on identification accuracy. In Experiment 2, we measured the effect of elevation and symbol texture on identification speed. Results: Symbol elevation influenced both speed and accuracy of identification with thresholds being higher than found in work on detection and discrimination but lower than on existing tactile maps. Further, as predicted from existing knowledge of tactile perception, rough features were identified more quickly than smooth ones. Finally, visually impaired participants performed better than sighted ones. Conclusion: The symbol elevations necessary for identification (0. 040 to 0. 080 mm) are considerably lower than would be expected on the basis of existing tactile maps (generally 0. 5 mm or higher) and design guidelines (0. 4 mm). Application: Tactile map production costs could be reduced and map durability increased by reducing symbol elevation. Further, legibility of maps could be improved by using rough features, which are read more easily, and smaller symbols, which reduces crowding of graphics...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal British Journal of Visual Impairment and the definitive published version is available at [URL] series of 14 <b>tactile</b> <b>symbols</b> were developed to represent different colours and shades for {{children and young people}} {{who are blind or have}} visual impairment. A study compared three different methods for representing the symbols: (1) embroidered thread, (2) heated ‘swell’ paper, and (3) representation in plastic using Additive Manufacturing (AM; three-dimensional printing). The results show that for all three materials, the recognition of particular symbols varied between 2. 40 and 3. 95 s. The average times for the three materials across all colours were 2. 26 s for AM material, 3. 20 s for swell paper, and 4. 03 s for embroidered symbols. These findings can be explained by the fact that the AM material (polylactide) is firmer and more easily perceived tactually than the other two materials. While AM plastic offers a potentially useful means to communicate colours for appropriate objects, traditional media are still important in certain contexts...|$|R
40|$|It {{is still}} {{recognized}} as a challenge task while {{blind and visually impaired}} people travel outdoor independently, even if {{there are a number of}} assistive mobility aids available. In addition to building universal facilities in urban and rural environments for them, it is essential to develop novel mobility assistive technologies and systems to satisfy their increasing demands for mobility. To investigate those demands, an international survey with 106 blind and visually impaired people from 13 countries is undertaken within this work, with regarding to outdoor mobility experiences, usages of mobile devices and collaborative approaches. From the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Accessibility, the dissertation focuses on enhancing blind people’s capabilities of acquisition of spatial environmental information from tactile displays. The spatial environmental information, in this study, is in terms of clusters of surrounding obstacles, geographic information on city maps, and information on environmental accessibility. In order to non-visual representation of the clusters of surroundings obstacles detected by a 3 D Time-of-Flight (ToF) infrared camera, a portable pin-matrix display with a matrix of 30 x 32 pins is employed and a pre-designed set of <b>tactile</b> obstacle <b>symbols</b> is used to render the properties of obstacles (e. g., type, size). Additionally, aiming at helping blind people access geographic information, a desktop based pin-matrix display (an array of 60 x 120 pins) and a mobile pin-matrix display (an array of 30 x 32 pins) are used to represent a large-scale city map and a location-aware city map, respectively. A set of <b>tactile</b> map <b>symbols</b> rendered with the raised and lowered pins, has been designed for rendering various map features. To allow blind and visually impaired people to acquire information on environmental accessibility, besides a traditional web browser client and a popular smart phone client, an audio-haptic client on a tactile display with 7200 pins is developed. Users are able to create and share collaborative annotations on environmental accessibility across the 3 clients. The proposed approaches about non-visual representation of obstacles and map features by <b>tactile</b> <b>symbols</b> on pin-matrix displays, will contribute to the fields of accessible tactile graphic well, especially in the coming era of affordable pin-matrix displays. Meanwhile, the collaborative approach for improving environmental accessibility will encourage the society to raise the floor of accessibility for all. A number of further studies can be continued based on the current findings within this work, aiming at enhancing mobility aids for blind and visually impaired people gradually...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Schizophrenia, {{like many}} other {{psychiatric}} disorders, is accompanied by disturbance of somatosensory function, which is often minute. This includes compromised somatosensory feedback and action monitoring [1], as well as pathological pain perception, for example abnormal pain thresholds [2] or painful somatosensory hallucinations, i. e. spontaneous perception of pain without adequate external stimuli. Co-enaesthetic hallucinations (from co-aneasthesia [3, 4]) are encountered in a small subset of patients with schizophrenia. The main symptoms of this sub-syndrome <b>include</b> <b>tactile</b> hallucinations, and itching or burning sensations, which are often painful [5]. This syndrome is relatively rare compared to auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia, and its biological basis is mostly unexplored [6]. It is unclear, which particular brain areas {{are involved in the}} generation of hallucinations of pain in this condition. Functional neuroimaging could provide a useful method to detec...|$|R
