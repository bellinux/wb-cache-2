40|$|Poor {{marketing}} and distribution frequently waste opportunities provided by increased or diversified agricultural production There are many examples where farmers have produced higher yields or cultivated new crops at their own expense and risk but have not benefited from any increased income. Instead, they may have suffered financial loss from investing in higher inputs or labour. It {{is not surprising that}} farmers become disappointed and revert to less onerous and risky production strategies to meet local needs only. This limits their income and stifles the development of a rural economy. It also deprives the country of much-needed food for the cities and of products to export for foreign exchange. Many, governments have now recognized the need for improved marketing, distribution and exports. One particularly successful example is the Dominica Export <b>Import</b> <b>Agency</b> (DEXIA), which was set up by the Government of Dominica in July 1986. In less than three years it has achieved some dramatic results. DEXIA is responsible for issuing licences for the import of basic food commodities such as rice and sugar. So it controls imports, allowing local production to satisfy the domestic market first. However, DEXIA's main objective is to encourage, help and provide facilities for the private sector in Dominica to increase exports of vegetables, fruit, flowers and handicrafts. There are 20 - 25 commodities currently exported and DEXIA has prayed an important,sometimes crucial, role in finding or developing markets for them New markets Bananas are the main crop in Dominica; they are marketed through the Banana Marketing Corporation. Similarly, the bulk of coconut production is processed by Dominica Coconut Products, which manufactures a wide range of value-added coconut-based products including coconut oil and soaps. But green water nuts or jelly nuts, which previously were sold only locally, are now exported by a co-operative of growers which was formed originally to export plantains. DEXIA staff identified a market for jellynuts and plantains among expatriate Dominicans and other West Indians in the United Kingdom. The cooperative supplying this market now exports 16 times the value of plantains each fortnight that it exported in its early months of activity in 1986. Grapefruit and limes are two other long established crops In Dominica, yet new markets have been found for both crops and various products have been developed from limes to supplement the sale of fresh fruit. Mangoes, avocados and various root crops are also being exported in increasing quantities, and so are fresh flowers, herbs and spices (including ginger). DEXIA has worked in parallel with the existing cooperative of flower and ornamental growers to increase production of anthuriums, red ginger lilies and helleconia. New hybrid anthuriums have been introduced, and DEXIA has played a role in improving the quality of packaging. 20 point programme As a statutory government body, DEXIA works to fulfil its brief either by increasing exports in response to existing production or in response to new markets. Production-led export development is where existing crops are available and expansion of the market is sought to absorb surplus existing production. Market-led export development is where a new market is discovered, but either there is no existing production or existing production, does not match market requirements in terms of quality, quantity' or season of supply. Two examples where new markets were identified were red peppers and christophines, both of which have long been grown in Dominica. A visit by a senior DEXIA staff member to Canada established that the market there demanded the Scotch Bonnet variety of red peppers and white christophines. Until then, it was rare to find pure Scotch Bonnet peppers in Dominica and most of the christophines grown were of the green variety, so production was changed to match the special needs of the newly identified market. Marketing assistance In some countries statutory marketing organisations provide the only outlet for some or all products and therefore dominate the market and the farmers. In Dominica government policy is that commercial activity shall {{be in the hands of}} the private sector. Therefore DEXIA'S role is to assist the private sector by helping to form groups of growers; by serving individuals and groups with market intelligence; by advising on transport, credit sources and insurance requirements; and by helping groups to negotiate with shipping and air lines to obtain must favourable terms DEXIA may also test a new market by underwriting the supply of a pilot shipment but, once the needs of the market are established, it is left to the private sector to develop the new market opportunity. An example was when a company in France requested produce grown without ferdlizer or pesticides. Organically grown produce commands significantly higher prices and DEXIA, recognizing this as a potential new market, supplied a trial shipment of grapefruit, dried coconut and herbs. It will now be up to local growers to produce to the criteria specified and to supply further shipments. > is a new phrase for something that skilled traders have always recognised: in a competitive marketplace it is essential to recognize the precise needs of buyers and to judge how best your products can satisfy these needs. And, if a buyer demands a new product, this provides an opportunity for developing new lines of goods. Finally, high quality and efficient transportation remain as vital as ever.

40|$|If ACP {{countries}} are {{to improve their}} agricultural productivity they must do so through their rural people. And, if full employment, food self-sufficiency and an exportable {{surplus of agricultural products}} are to be achieved, rural people must tee motivated. Owner ship of land is a powerful incentive, especially among young people who see no future for themselves as hired labour but who arewilling to work atbuilding up their own family holding. In the majority of Caribbean countries, widespread land ownership is very recent but, in several countries where land reform and re-distribution has begun, the benefits are already evident. For much of their modern history most Caribbean countries were developed as plantation economies, where the mass of the population worked as labour on monoculture estates owned by a minority of landowners or foreign-based companies. However, many foreign-based companies, and even some large local landowners, found the combination of poor prices for the main plantation crops (banana, citrus, cocoa, coconut and sugar) and rising labour costs and unrest in the 1970 s too problematic, and either sold up or abandoned their estates. As a result, governments gained possession and were provided with the opportunity to offer the land in small blocks to previously landless people. Privatization in Grenada In Grenada, by 1983 a succession of governments had acquired 36 estates, ranging from 17 - 105 hectares (40 - 250 acres). In 1986 it was decided by the Government to 'divest' these estates: to divide them into economically viable units and to offer them for private ownership. In common with the majority of islands in the Caribbean, Grenada has a very steep terrain so at divestment, farmers were encouraged to continue to grow one of the major crops - banana, cocoa and nutmeg but to diversify by growing other crops for food and for sale. In order to do this without encouraging erosion, a programme of soil and water conservation was started in which the farmers were involved. With FAO technical assistance, settlers were helped to build bench terraces, of eyebrow terraces, access roads and dams. A wide range of fruit trees was planted, while leucaena and Honduran Pine were planted on the steepest land as conservation forest The idea was to provide improved income, long-term security and to involve the new settlers in sustainable production techniques. Considerable progress has been made: people in Grenada are increasingly aware of the need for food self-sufficiency and import-substitution; more locally produced foods are available in markets and for the thriving tourist industry; and surplus fruit is processed for jams, jellies and confectionery. There has been a deliberate policy to choose young people as new settlers and {{there is no shortage of}} applicants: there are 30 - 40 applicants for each farm that becomes available, of whom 80 %- 90 % are in the 25 - 30 age group. Dominica diversifies Similar success has been achieved in Dominica, where the main plantation crops were banana and limes. Again, these remain the major crops on the small farms that have been carved from the big estates. Where banana still offers a good return, some far' mers continue to specialize in the crop, but others have diversified into vegetables and tubers for the local market, ginger for export and also flowers such as ginger lily. In the drier south of the island limes were and remain the major crop but, because of the depressed price over several years, farmers settled here have diversified and grow passion fruit, Aloe vera and forage grasses for feeding to one or two milk cows and 10 - 15 sheep and goats. Some farmers are also keeping one or two breeding pigs. However, land redistribution is seldom sufficient when carried out in isolation, so in Grenada and Dominica, new farmers have been provided with technical advice and assistance with marketing their crops. In Dominica the marketing of new crops has been well developed through the Dominican Export and <b>Import</b> <b>Agency,</b> DEXIA (See Spore N 20). There is a processing facility for limes on the island and a factory for coconut products, such as oil and soap. Aloe vera, a low-growing, succulent plant that thrives on dry, porous soils, is purchased by the Windward Island Aloe Company and is used in a wide range of cosmetics and body-care products. All these marketing intitiatives have resulted in firm markets, increased local employment and added value to products, to the benefit of farmers and the national economy. Integrated development Credit has also played an important role in developing the small-farmer economy in Dominica, as has the construction of feeder roads into previously inaccesible parts of the island. The United Nations lnternational Fund for Agricultural Development has assisted by providing funds for credit while IFAD and the European Development Fund have financed access roads. It is clearly evident that without an integrated approach of technical advice, credit, availability of inputs, access roads and marketing, land redistribution alone would not have had the desired impact and might even have resulted in stagnant production, frustration and a decline in standards of soil and water conservation.

Our research question addresses the social impact of the imbalance in the labor market between Lebanese and non-Lebanese workers, and the impact that such diversity (of both nationalities and class status) has on labor relations and the structure of the working class. Eventually, we argue that specific conditions of employment, characterised by the role of labor <b>importing</b> <b>agencies,</b> the so-called sponsorship system, outsourcing, the casualization of work and the ethnic fragmentation of the labor market, result in the segmentation of the labor force along national as well as gender lines.

40|$|This project {{analyzes}} {{the legal and}} institutional opportunities and constraints on conjunctive management of groundwater and surface water in California. Conjunctive water use involves the coordination of groundwater and surface water management, usually by recharging the groundwater basin with surface water during times of hydrologic surplus and withdrawing the stored water during times of drought. The goals of conjunctive management include: (1) augmentation of total usable water supplies; (2) recharge of overdrafted aquifers; (3) increase in total available water supplies at less economic, political, and environmental cost than through construction of additional surface storage; (4) improvement of water quality; and (5) enhanced reliability of water supplies during times of drought. There {{are a number of}} examples of conjunctive water management in California, particularly in adjudicated groundwater basins in Southern California. These management arrangements generally work well because the rights to groundwater are quantified and the management agencies have legal authority to enforce the pumping limitations, pricing rules, and other policies that govern groundwater and surface water use. In unadjudicated basins, however, the feasibility of conjunctive management is less certain. This is particularly true in basins in which a portion of the surface water is imported, stored as groundwater, and then later withdrawn for uses outside the groundwater basin. In these situations there exist an array of legal and institutional uncertainties that render conjunctive management more difficult than in adjudicated basins. These uncertainties include questions about the ownership of the imported water, liability for displacement of in-basin recharge capacity, regulation of groundwater users who are not parties to the conjunctive management agreement, the authority of local water agencies over the importation and exportation of surface water, and liability for changes in water quality. To facilitate the creation of conjunctive water management programs in unadjudicated groundwater basins, the California Legislature should modify the current laws governing groundwater and conjunctive use to help accomplish more efficient conjunctive management of interconnected waterresources. By clarifying the authority of local agencies to design, maintain, and enforce conjunctive use agreements, the Legislature could remove barriers that presently create disincentives for participation in such programs. This report recommends a variety of such legislative reforms, including express authorization for local entities with groundwater management authority to engage in conjunctive use programs, clarification of the respective powers of the local <b>agency</b> and the <b>importing</b> <b>agency</b> to control the water stored and used in such programs, and clarification of the authority of local agencies to enact and to enforce anti-export ordinances...|$|R

40|$|How has the Indian state {{changed with}} {{economic}} liberalization? While many scholars have explored the altered party politics and class {{basis of the}} liberalization-era state, few have studied its transforming internal organizational forms and functioning. This thesis aims to provide an empirically grounded answer to this question. To do this it uses the lens of electricity: the sector {{lies at the heart}} of contemporary capital accumulation, state power, and distributive politics, and has witnessed almost a quarter-century of institutional reforms since 1991. In the sector, new or reworked organizational forms—such as <b>imported</b> regulatory <b>agencies,</b> corporatized state-owned enterprises, and public-private partnerships—have been grafted onto the older statist system in a process of institutional layering. Favouring state-business collaboration and prioritizing rapid economic growth, this mode of state operation is distinct both from a liberal, market-oriented state and from India’s older state-led mode. It combines state intervention and selective adoption of parts of the Washington Consensus template to produce a reinvented mode of power governance that I term state capitalism 2. 0. India’s new state-market hybrid is not a functional alternative to the older models, however. The layered process through which it has emerged means that it is distinctively dysfunctional. Organizations have emerged in an ad hoc fashion, each shaped and reshaped by multiple collective interests, while existing organizations are rarely destroyed. The resulting layered amalgam institutionalizes contradictory state strategies, co-optation by competing interest groups, and a dualistic system of services and subsidies. Consequently the sector’s performance remains poor. As a result, developments in the Indian power sector suggest that the state's 'pro-business' transition has been painful and incomplete. At least in this sector, the Indian state remains simultaneously more indispensable, more ambivalently pro-business, and more chaotic than much theory might suggest.

Economists and marketers refer to the key technologies that influence significantly a sphere of services the following issues: energy technologies, as well as technology of design, of constructional materials and of processes and genetic engineering. The most wide-spread (from a general list of 45 classes of the International classification of goods and services) are services that are referred to the 35 th class of ICGS – services that are provided to the firms and natural persons as for industrial and commercial management of their affairs, services of advertising agencies, aid in promotion of goods and services, services in organizing of exhibitions and fairs, clerical works, auction sales of information services {{as well as information}} gathering to computer databases and services of <b>import</b> and export <b>agencies.</b> There is a chain of identical factors that serve as a catalyst of transformations of country’s economic sector. They include state politics, social changes, and tendencies of business development, information technologies progress, internationalization and globalization of service companies. Policy of the state in the field of services is defined as a dominant factor both on the national level and on the regional and international levels as well. In our country government control is used in such branches as air transportation, TV and radio communications, separate sectors of food, light and engineering industries, hotel business etc. Social changes in the society are the result of changing a life style and increasing incomes of population. The main trends of factor’s action are studied: "The Tendencies of Business Development" are contained in creating service centers, opening own shops, restaurants, consulting offices, livening means of increasing income at the expense of reducing costs connected with providing services (substitution of personnel work with technological innovations, self-service, introduction of reengineering); increasing the quality of services and distributing franchising as a method of developing and financing service networks, which support the only conception of service; "Development of Information Technologies" – is in the integration of computer and telecommunication technologies; "Internationalization and Globalization of Service Companies" – is a priority of development of tourist sector services and sector of freight transportation and passenger traffic...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine and analyse the {{political}} role and strategies of the women"s movement in Zambia. In particular, the aim is through two specific case studies - the Oasis Forum and the co-operation with the traditional leadership - to understand and identify factors, which both enable and constrain women"s political agency and shape its particular nature. The topic is approached from the perspective of gendered social movement theory, as one finds, it is attentive to the specific gender dynamics that shape women"s mobilisation and interest articulation. The gendered collective of the social movement theory has to, however, be theorised in a manner that recognises the <b>import</b> of individual <b>agency.</b> In this case it also needs to be situated in the context of an African post-colonial nation - a fact that has some necessary further implications upon both the theory and the empirical analysis. The central argument of this study maintains that the Zambian NGO women have succeeded in transforming the formerly welfare- centred NGO space into an effective site from which to make political claims on authorities. This is allowed by the development of a strategy, which is tied to the emergence of certain political opportunity structures that the women have perceived in gendered terms and have been able to use for their specific ambitions, as well as the strategy based on alliance-building and networking. Thus, as opposed to studies that emphasise autonomy as the principal strategic element of the women"s movements, in Zambia networking and/or alliance building appears to prevail. Finally, with regards to the content of the women"s movement activities, it is argued, that a distinct form of politics is being applied, allowing for the fine balancing act used to discipline the interests of various societal actors all playing a crucial part in making the vision of the women"s movement to become a reality. Research for this thesis was conducted by using a qualitative methodology. Specific research methods employed were the semi-structured interview and observation. A considerable amount of secondary material, in the form of newspaper articles and reports, was also collected. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|Mr Hayden Blades is an {{agricultural}} economist. As Executive Director of the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) he has instigated a major restructuring programme {{designed to make}} CARDI more responsive to the challenges currency facing Caribbean agriculture. The Caribbean is at a cross-roads {{in the development of}} its agriculture. Here, the agricultural system was set up specifically to produce primary products for sale in protected European markets. It was not until Independence that attention was turned to increasing the output of food crops for the domestic consumer. Even so, the domestic food sector remained a very much smaller component compared with plantation crops. This formula is not one to guarantee success or indeed survival in the future. The initiative to institute change has been taken {{out of the hands of}} Caribbean countries by the liberalization of international trade that has been sign-posted by the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations. For the first time in history we are now seeing attempts to bring the trade in agricultural products within the confines of international trade rules. Indeed, even before the WTO Round was concluded members took the decision to liberalize trade in all tropical pro-ducts. Countries in the Caribbean region have been undergoing structural adjustment programmes, as have others elsewhere. Our programmes have included the necessity for the economic mobilization of our economies including the need to substantially reduce the protection previously afforded to agricultural crops both in terms of quantity restrictions and tariffs. This highly competitive situation, that has been so suddenly thrust on us, has resulted in the destruction of some of our domestic industries. For example, the poultry industry in Guyana collapsed within nine months of restrictions on imports being removed. Beef and lamb production from herds grazed under coconuts in Trinidad and Tobago cannot compete with meat landed in Port of Spain at subsidized prices from Europe. At this historical cross-roads we are going to have to institute a substantial transformation of our agricultural industries. We are going to have to move from a situation of fixed price markets for previously negotiated quantities, to a new era of new technologies to increase productivity so that we can market our commodities on an internationally competitive basis. In order to do this we will have to develop a new indigenous marketing industry, because we have no history or experience of marketing our products in the real sense of the term. In the past, quantities and prices were fixed and all that was left to arrange were transport and distribution. Now, we must conduct market research, identify niche markets, find new marketing partners, and create a whole new marketing infrastructure both physically and in terms of the people and skills required. We have to build a comprehensive market information system, and most critically of all, our producers must accept the challenge of producing a range of crops and products which are always going to be highly competitive in terms of price, quality and delivery. To service our farmers' new needs, extension services will have to change from their past emphasis on production to a new emphasis on marketing. This will require training and a change in mindset. How easily or readily will Caribbean agriculture change? Much will depend on the political commitment and priority accorded to agriculture in our countries and this will have a direct effect on farmer attitude and morale. To change production patterns and adopt new crops and techniques involves investment and risk; farmers will not accept the need for either without the support of good production and marketing advice and the confidence that they can be competitive. Precedents exist: Jamaica's Blue Mountain coffee has been branded and marketed successfully, and more recently, Belize has worked with the organization Fair Trade to develop a niche market for organically produced chocolate sold under the Black and Gold label. DEXIA, the Dominica Export and <b>Import</b> Information <b>Agency,</b> and the Agricultural Diversification Coordinating Unit for the OECS (Organization of Eastern Caribbean States) have experiences to share. The withdrawal of Geest from the Windward Islands banana trade now offers the opportunity for local initiatives. Some people still look to tourism, mining or industrialization as more attractive options for developing our Caribbean economies and all will contribute to a greater or lesser extent. However, agriculture will continue to underpin almost all our economies with some countries, such as Belize and Guyana, almost totally dependent. We have no choice in this matter. The Caribbean Heads of State, in their New vision for the Agricultural Sector, have accepted the need to develop agriculture on an internationally competitive basis: to develop appropriate human resources, and to negotiate a sensitive phasing out of currently protected markets and their replacement with viable alternatives. Our success will also depend on attracting some of our brightest young people to train for careers in agricultural production, marketing and advice. Throughout our history our people have met our challenges and I do not see why we should not do so again. we are probably in a better position now than ever before with the availability of better access to information and better educated and trained human resources. To forge an economically viable and environmentally sustainable agriculture to feed and provide income for our peoples is a major challenge but not an insurmountable one in my view.

40|$|Goodbye import duties. Farewell quotas. Hello rules. Trade in {{agricultural}} products from ACP countries {{now has to}} comply with complex new rules, often about quality. We look at how to jump the latest barriers. With world trade now liberalised under the World Trade Organisation, there are new opportunities and challenges for ACP agricultural exporters. The rapid removal of import levies, duties and fixed import quotas for certain products in the industrialised world means that exporters have {{to compete in the}} market place. For this, they need information about the size and accessibility of the market, and the requirements and regulations about quality and packaging. Fortunately there are several information services covering the requirements of importing countries with regard to: Logistical requirements : volumes and sizes of shipments, packaging requirements, shipping and transit storage, health and hygiene standards, and quality control Market intelligence : how to research the market in a country or region, how to contact and develop relationships with importers Finance: how to organise finance and credit while waiting for payment, including export guarantees. In addition to trade offices in the embassies of importing countries, and export finance information at national chambers of commerce, you can contact any of these international and regional bodies. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) exists to promote world trade, to the benefit of developing countries. Their 'Tradepoint' network, contactable through the UNCTAD's head office, has national offices in many countries with broad-ranging information services. The World Trade Organisation (WTO), although it is often host to uncertainty and controversy at the political level (such as on agricultural products, which it will debate in December 1999), has extensive and helpful advisory services for exporters. Linked to the WTO is the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures Agreement (SPS) applied in cooperation with other international bodies, principally the FAO. The SPS seeks to ensure common standards for food safety and animal and plant health. Large markets The world's largest market for agricultural products is the United States of America, and its import requirements are well-documented by the American Association of Exporters & Importers (AAEI). The second largest market is the European Union, whose fifteen Member States apply common import rules. The fact that it is called a 'single market' hides the fact that the Union contains a great variety of markets, with different consumer tastes and demands. The Centre for the Promotion of Imports from developing countries (CBI) advises both exporters, and European importers. It provides market information, matching programmes, promotion advice in marketing, market surveys, trade documentation, and a far-sighted service on the health, social and environmental demands of the market. It also provides connections to import bodies in each EU member state. Many ACP agricultural exports to Europe are in horticulture, a sector well-promoted by COLEACP, an interprofessional association of exporters, importers and other operators from the ACP-EU industry. COLEACP is {{regarded as one of the}} success stories in ACP-EU cooperation, with many satisfied clients in the promotion of competitive ACP exports of fresh fruit and vegetables, flowers and ornamental plants. It may not last for ever World trade will increasingly be subject to concerns, and perhaps rules, regarding social and environmental issues and a wise exporter will do well to anticipate them. These issues include consumer demand for guarantees about the method of production (such as organic agriculture, absence of child labour, and profit-sharing schemes, often collectively described as 'Fair Trade'), and international demand to reduce energy use in the packaging and shipment of produce, particularly over long distances. Already in Europe there are steps to reduce imports of non-essential products, such as bananas in Norway. And many food packaging plants in ACP countries use heavy materials and technologies that are no longer accepted in the North because of their energy waste. You might think that the world is entering a period of free and frenetic trade. Maybe, but it may not last for long. Several global governance bodies are already preparing for a new wave of restrictions on environmental and energy grounds. A hub in this movement is the United Nations Department for Sustainable Development which can keep you informed, and ahead of most exporters, of forthcoming trends. In the meantime, be informed and trade away. If the big organisations cannot help you promptly and to the extent you want, try this surprising source. The most comprehensive and accessible collection of contact details of <b>import</b> and export <b>agencies</b> all over the world is in the small but enterprising state of El Salvador, in Central America. The Electronic System for Foreign Trade has a trade information service in English and Spanish, open to anybody, by mail or electronic mail.
