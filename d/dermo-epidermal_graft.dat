40|$|Lipomas are {{the most}} common benign tumors of the mesenchyme; they are {{composed}} of mature lipocytes. Benign fatty tumours can arise in any location in which fat is present. Most patients affected by such tumours are in their fifth or sixth decade of life. Only rarely are children affected. Lipomas may be single or multiple. Multiple lipomas are more common in women; many are seen in a familial setting. For a lipoma to be referred to as "giant", the lesion should be at least 10 cm in diameter or weigh a minimum of 1000 g. When very close to vital structures, giant lipomas may, on account of their excessive size, cause functional limitations, such as lymphedema, pain or nerve compression syndromes. Owing to the peculiarity of this condition and the difficulties encountered in its diagnosis and treatment, a case of a giant fibrolipoma in the leg is reported. A 48 -year-old woman presented with an enlarging, soft, noduled mass on the right ankle and in the lower third of the right leg and heel; it was decided to remove the mass with all the overlying epidermis and to repair the resulting lesion first with fibroblast culture and subsequently with a meshed <b>dermo-epidermal</b> <b>graft.</b> One year after surgery, both the local and the general condition of the patient were good and there were no signs of recurrenc...|$|E
40|$|Chronic wounds such as {{diabetic}} foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers {{are common}} problems in {{people suffering from}} type 2 diabetes. These can cause pain, and nerve damage, eventually leading to foot or leg amputation. These types of wounds {{are very difficult to}} treat and sometimes take months or even years to heal because of many possible complications during the process. Allogeneic skin grafting has been used to improve wound healing, but the majority of grafts do not survive several days after being implanted. We have been studying the behavior of fibroblasts and keratinocytes in engineered capillary-like endothelial networks. A <b>dermo-epidermal</b> <b>graft</b> has been implanted in an athymic nude mouse model to assess the integration with the host tissue as well as the wound healing process. To build these networks into a skin graft, a modified inkjet printer was used, which allowed the deposit of human microvascular endothelial cells. Neonatal human dermal fibroblast cells and neonatal human epidermal keratinocytes were manually mixed in the collagen matrix while endothelial cells printed. A full-thickness wound was created {{at the top of the}} back of athymic nude mice and the area was covered by the bilayered graft. Mice of the different groups were followed until completion of the specified experimental time line, at which time the animals were humanely euthanized and tissue samples were collected. Wound contraction improved by up to 10 % when compared with the control groups. Histological analysis showed the neoskin having similar appearance to the normal skin. Both layers, dermis and epidermis, were present with thicknesses resembling normal skin. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed favorable results proving survival of the implanted cells, and confocal images showed the human cells' location in the samples that were collocated with the bilayer printed skin graft...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Human {{amniotic fluid}} {{comprises}} cells with high differentiation capacity, thus representing a potential cell source for skin tissue engineering. In this experimental study, we investigated {{the ability of}} human amniotic fluid derived cells to substitute dermal fibroblasts and support epidermis formation and stratification in a humanized animal model. METHODS: <b>Dermo-epidermal</b> skin <b>grafts</b> with either amniocytes or with fibroblasts in the dermis were compared in a rat model. Full-thickness skin wounds {{on the back of}} immuno-incompetent rats were covered with skin grafts with (1) amniocytes in the dermis, (2) fibroblasts in the dermis, or, (3) acellular dermis. Grafts were excised 7 and 21  days post transplantation. Histology and immunofluorescence were performed to investigate epidermis formation, stratification, and expression of established skin markers. RESULTS: The epidermis of skin grafts engineered with amniocytes showed near-normal anatomy, a continuous basal lamina, and a stratum corneum. Expression patterns for keratin 15, keratin 16, and Ki 67 were similar to grafts with fibroblasts; keratin 1 expression was not yet fully established in all suprabasal cell layers, expression of keratin 19 was increased and not only restricted to the basal cell layer as seen in grafts with fibroblasts. In grafts with acellular dermis, keratinocytes did not survive. CONCLUSION: <b>Dermo-epidermal</b> skin <b>grafts</b> with amniocytes show near-normal physiological behavior suggesting that amniocytes substitute fibroblast function to support the essential cross-talk between mesenchyme and epithelia needed for epidermal stratification. This novel finding has considerable implications regarding tissue engineering...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Currently, {{acellular}} dermal substitutes {{used for}} skin reconstruction are usually covered with split-thickness skin grafts. The {{goal of this}} study was to develop an animal model in which such dermal substitutes can be tested under standardized conditions using a bioengineered <b>dermo-epidermal</b> skin <b>graft</b> for coverage. METHODS: Bioengineered grafts consisting of collagen type I hydrogels with incorporated human fibroblasts and human keratinocytes seeded on these gels were produced. Two different dermal substitutes, namely Matriderm(®), and an acellular collagen type I hydrogel, were applied onto full-thickness skin wounds created on the back of immuno-incompetent rats. As control, no dermal substitute was used. As coverage for the dermal substitutes either the bioengineered grafts were used, or, as controls, human split-thickness skin or neonatal rat epidermis were used. Grafts were excised 21  days post-transplantation. Histology and immunofluorescence was performed to investigate survival, epidermis formation, and vascularization of the grafts. RESULTS: The bioengineered grafts survived on all tested dermal substitutes. Epidermis formation and vascularization were comparable to the controls. CONCLUSION: We could successfully use human bioengineered grafts to test different dermal substitutes. This novel model can be used to investigate newly designed dermal substitutes in detail and in a standardized way...|$|R
40|$|The first bioengineered, autologous, <b>dermo-epidermal</b> skin <b>grafts</b> are {{presently}} undergoing clinical trials; hence, {{it is reasonable}} to envisage the next clinical step at the forefront of plastic and burn surgery, which is the generation of autologous skin grafts that contain vascular plexuses, preformed in vitro. As the importance of the blood, and particularly the lymphatic vascular system, is increasingly recognized, it is attractive to engineer both human blood and lymphatic vessels in one tissue or organ graft. We show here that functional lymphatic capillaries can be generated using three-dimensional hydrogels. Like normal lymphatics, these capillaries branch, form lumen, and take up fluid in vitro and in vivo after transplantation onto immunocompromised rodents. Formation of lymphatic capillaries could be modulated by both lymphangiogenic and anti-lymphangiogenic stimuli, demonstrating the potential usefulness of this system for in vitro testing. Blood and lymphatic endothelial cells never intermixed during vessel development, nor did blood and lymphatic capillaries anastomose under the described circumstances. After transplantation of the engineered grafts, the human lymphatic capillaries anastomosed to the nude rat's lymphatic plexus and supported fluid drainage. Successful preclinical results suggest that these skin grafts could be applied on patients suffering from severe skin defects...|$|R
40|$|Chronic wounds are {{becoming}} more frequent. Foot ulcers affect approximately 10 % - 15 % of patients with diabetes throughout their lifetimes, and by 2025, it is estimated the prevalence of diabetes will be 250 {{million people in the}} worldwide. There is increased potential for patients with peripheral neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease to suffer more foot injuries. These conditions reduce the normal pain sensations and healing of minor traumas, allowing the development of chronic non-healing ulcers, often preceding lower-extremity amputation. These types of wounds are very difficult to treat and sometimes take months or even years to heal because of many possible complications during the process. The treatments of wounds and its complications represent more than $ 20 billion in United States, in part because non-healing wound need repetitive treatments. Close to 10 % of patients admitted to hospitals will receive skin grafting treatments for various reasons, thus bringing the skin grafting market to $ 1 billion yearly. ^ Skin graft materials have been used trying to improve wound healing. The majority of them are allogeneic and they do not survive several days when are implanted. Several studies exist where commercially available dermal substitutes have been augmented with autologous cells and these studies suggested that autologous cells still may not survive {{due to the lack of}} vascularization in these constructs. Recognizing this, we have been studying the behavior of fibroblasts and keratinocytes in engineered capillary-like endothelial networks. A <b>dermo-epidermal</b> <b>graft</b> has been implanted in athymic nude mouse model to assess the integration with the host tissue as well as the wound healing process. ^ To build these networks into skin graft, a modified inkjet printer was used, which allowed to deposit human microvascular endothelial cells. Neonatal human dermal fibroblast cells and neonatal human epidermal keratinocytes were manually mixed in the collagen matrix while endothelial cells printed. A full thickness wound was created at the top of the back of athymic nude mice and the area was covered by the bilayer skin graft. The mice of the different groups (experimental; printable skin graft, comparative; comertial available skin graft-Apligraf®, and control group; without any type of skin graft) were followed until completion of the specified experimental time line, at which time the animals were humanely euthanized and tissue samples were collected. The tissue was fixed in 10 % buffer formalin, and process for histological and immunohestochemical analysis. ^ In conclusion, wound contraction improved by up to 10 % when compared with the control groups. Histological analysis showed the neoskin having similar appearance than normal skin. Both layers dermis and epidermis were present with thicknesses resembling normal skin. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed favorable results proving survival of the implanted cells, and confocal images showed the human cells location in the samples that were collocated with the bilayer printed skin graft. ...|$|E
40|$|Backround. Deep {{skin burn}} injuries, {{especially}} {{those on the}} face, hands, feet, genitalia and perineum represent significant therapeutic challenges. Autologous <b>dermo-epidermal</b> skin <b>grafts</b> (DESG) have become standard of care for treating deep burns. Additionally, human autologous thrombin activated autologous platelet concentrate (APC) has gained acceptance {{in the setting of}} wounds. While each of these interventions has been independently shown to accelerate healing, the combination of the two has never been evaluated. We hypothesized that the addition of platelets (source of growth factors and inhibitors necessary for tissue repair) to the DESG (source of progenitor cells and of tissue proteases necessary for spatial and temporal control of growth regulators released from platelets) would create the optimal environment for the reciprocal interaction of cells within the healing tissues. Methods: We used clinical examination (digital photography), standardised scales for evaluating pain and scarring, in combination with blood perfusion (laser Doppler imaging), as well as molecular and laboratory analyses. Results: We show {{for the first time that}} the combination of APC and DESG leads to earlier relief of pain, and decreased use of analgesics, antipruritics and orthotic devices. Most importantly, this treatment is associated with earlier discharges from hospital and significant cost savings. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that DESG engraftment is facilitated by the local addition of platelets and by systemic thrombocytosis. This local interaction leads to the physiological revascularization at 1 - 3 months. We observed significant elevation of circulating platelets in early stages of engraftment (1 - 7 days), which normalized over the subsequent 7 and 90 days. Web of Science 158225824...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Autologous bio-engineered dermo-epidermal skin {{substitutes}} (DESS) {{represent an}} alternative therapeutic option for a definitive treatment of skin defects in human patients. Largely, {{the interaction of}} host immune cells with transplanted DESS {{is considered to be}} essential for the granulation tissue formation, graft take, and its functionality. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the spatiotemporal distribution and density of host-derived monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes in vascularized (vascDESS) versus non-vascularized DESS (non-vascDESS) in a rat model. METHODS: Keratinocytes and the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) were derived from human skin or human adipose tissue, respectively. Human SVF containing both endothelial and mesenchymal/stromal progenitors was used to develop a vascularized collagen type I-based dermal component in vitro. The donor-matched, monolayer-expanded adipose stromal cells lacking endothelial cells were used as a negative control. Subsequently, human keratinocytes were seeded on top of hydrogels to build <b>dermo-epidermal</b> skin <b>grafts.</b> After transplantation onto full-thickness skin wounds on the back of immuno-incompetent rats, grafts were excised and analyzed after  1 and 3  weeks. The expression of distinct inflammatory cell markers specific for host-derived monocytes/macrophages (CD 11 b, CD 68) or granulocytes (HIS 48) was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: All skin grafts were infiltrated by host-derived monocytes/macrophages (CD 11 b(+), CD 68 (+)) and granulocytes (HIS 48 (+)) between 1 - 3  week post-transplantation. When compared to non-vascDESS, the vascDESS showed an increased granulocyte infiltration at all time points analyzed with the majority of cells scattered throughout the whole dermal part. Whereas a moderate number of rat monocytes/macrophages (CD 11 b(+), CD 68 (+)) were found in vascDESS at 1  week, only a few cells were detected in non-vascDESS. We observed a time-dependent decrease of monocytes/macrophages in all transplants at 3  weeks. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a distinct spatiotemporal distribution of monocytes/macrophages as well as granulocytes in our transplants that closely resemble the one observed during physiological wound healing. The differences identified between vascDESS and non-vascDESS may indicate that human endothelial cells lining blood capillaries of vascDESS accelerate infiltration of monocytes and leukocytes...|$|R
