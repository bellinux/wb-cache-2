5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War I excited Baker, as it finally {{gave him a}} purpose in life and allowed him to {{make good use of}} his pilot training. He left the United States for Europe in the summer of 1917, among the first group of Americans to do so. Though eager to join the front immediately, Baker was told that he had to be {{certified}} by the French. Success in the courses was dependent on how quickly the pilots learned French, the predominant language of instruction. Though he managed to complete all the courses easily, a lack of qualified teachers meant that Baker was first sent to a school in England for more training and then back to France to teach Americans what he had learned in England, in an attempt to create pilots as quickly as possible. This discouraged Baker, who was eager to get into the front lines and fight. Owing to a lack of aircraft supplies, Baker was stuck in Paris, and doubted he would <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the front. While in Paris, he was happy to continue seeing Scott, who had enlisted as a nurse and worked at a hospital in France.|$|E

500|$|Results May Vary was {{released}} on September 23, 2003, and received largely unfavorable reviews. Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine panned the album, writing, [...] "the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [...] all {{attention is focused on}} the clown jumping up and down and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how the hell did he <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> put this mess out?" [...] The Guardian reviewer Caroline Sullivan wrote, [...] "At least Limp Bizkit can't be accused of festering in the rap-rock ghetto [...] But Durst's problems are ever-present – and does anybody still care?" [...] Despite criticisms of the album, it was a commercial success, peaking at No.3 on the Billboard 200.|$|E

[...] Exton suggested, [...] "Maybe she'll {{get a chance to}} do a non-comedic relief song in its entirety by season 5?"

The following month, {{it was announced that}} Sebastian Gregory had joined the cast of Neighbours as [...] "maths genius" [...] Ed Lee, Natasha's new love interest. Shortly after she drops out of her arts course at university, Natasha meets Ed in Charlie's. She initially believes he is trying to ask her out on a date, but is embarrassed when she realises that she has misread the signals. Natasha apologises and offers to help him out with a difficult maths equation he has been trying to solve. A writer for All About Soap explained [...] "judgemental Ed dismisses her, assuming the waitress hasn't got much in the brains department!". Natasha solves Ed's equation, proving him wrong and forcing him to apologise to her. Ed then invites Natasha to attend a university maths club, but she leaves at the last minute [...] "refusing to be labelled a nerd." [...] Natasha, Andrew and Ed make an anti-gambling phone app using a maths probability theory and Natasha develops feelings for Ed. While they are celebrating the completion of the phone app, Natasha and Ed embrace and almost share a kiss. However, the moment is ruined when Andrew calls Natasha.

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Results May Vary was mainly negative. The album received [...] "generally unfavorable reviews" [...] on Metacritic, {{with a score}} of 33 out of 100. This is the second lowest score on Metacritic, above only Kevin Federline's album Playing with Fire. According to AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, [...] "the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [...] all {{attention is focused on}} the clown jumping up and down and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how the hell did he <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> put this mess out?". In a review of Limp Bizkit's Greatest Hitz compilation, Erlewine called [...] "Behind Blue Eyes" [...] the worst in the band's [...] "never-ending series of embarrassing covers". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Durst's problems are ever-present - and does anybody still care?". Stylus criticized Results May Vary, calling it [...] "an album that {{can only be described as}} abysmal". Rob O'Connor of Yahoo! Launch also criticized Results May Vary: [...] "No, Fred, the results don't vary. The results are consistent throughout your new album—consistently crappy." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Limp Bizkit have decided to expose their tender side. They really shouldn't have bothered [...] having seen Limp Bizkit's 'other side', you want the old, unapologetic, meathead version back". Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also criticized Results May Vary: [...] "Results May Vary has a few highlights — 'Almost Over' (very Everlast) and 'Phenomenon' (very Primus) — but way too few to justify all the time and energy spent".|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, AllMusic editor John Bush recommended The Lost Tapes to [...] "hip-hop fans {{who want to}} hear some great rhyming with no added features" [...] and commented that tracks such as [...] "Doo Rags", [...] "No Idea's Original", and [...] "Black Zombie" [...] "stand up to anything Nas has recorded since the original Illmatic." [...] Jesal Padania of RapReviews commented that the album [...] "proved remarkably consistent throughout, and was a superb listening experience" [...] and considered it a studio release, stating [...] "this was a short sharp shock of awesome lyricism, and many, unofficially, consider {{this to be the}} closest cousin we will <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Illmatic II." [...] Pitchfork Medias Ryan Dombal cited the album as one of Nas' [...] "finest moments". About.com's Henry Adaso called it [...] "noteworthy because of its superiority to half the stuff in Nas' catalog." [...] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Chris Ryan was less enthusiastic about the album, finding it [...] "somewhat inconsistent, and certainly too scattered to be considered an album per se," [...] even though it features [...] "some classics, such as the nostalgic 'Doo Rags,' that are not to be missed." [...] In its 2007 issue, XXL included The Lost Tapes in its list of [...] "classic" [...] albums to be given the publication's maximum [...] "XXL" [...] rating.

500|$|The {{demise of}} Star Cops after just nine episodes {{has been seen}} as {{indicative}} of the decline of British television science fiction in the 1980s and, after Doctor Who followed Star Cops into cancellation in 1989, there would be no British regular science fiction drama series on British television until Bugs began in 1995. However, Star Cops has undergone something of a reappraisal – in science fiction circles at least – since it went off the air in 1987. Reviewing the VHS releases for TV Zone in 1991, Gary Russell stated that [...] "Star Cops represents excellent science fiction" [...] and recanted his original impression of the series upon broadcast that it was [...] "Bergerac in spacesuits, complete with rather cruddy visual effects and boring performances". A retrospective article penned by Keith Topping for Dreamwatch to mark the series' 10th anniversary in 1997 described Star Cops as [...] "a series that could (and should) {{have been one of the}} BBC's most popular, influential and entertaining products of the era. On at least one of these points the series failed miserably, but, certainly when it came to entertainment, it succeeded magnificently". In 1999, when science fiction magazine SFX asked an expert panel from the SF field, including Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter, to compile a list of the top 50 SF shows of all time, Star Cops came thirteenth on the list, with SFX describing it as [...] "the SF TV show SF writers love. It wasn't perfect but it's as close as TV will <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> producing proper written SF". Later, in 2005, SFX went on to poll its readers for their list of the top 50 British telefantasy shows and Star Cops was voted into twenty-seventh position on the list. The BBC themselves revisited Star Cops in a thirty-minute retrospective documentary about the show, recorded as part of a series titled The Cult of..., first broadcast on BBC Four on 28 November 2006 as part of that channel's Science Fiction Britannia season. Reflecting on the show in the programme, the author and critic Kim Newman said that [...] "the strength of Star Cops is the writing. I don't think any of the episodes are realised as well on screen as they are on the page. [...] If it had come back for another couple of seasons it might well have been the BBC's best science fiction show". The documentary concluded that Star Cops was an [...] "overlooked gem".|$|E

Addressing his district governors in the General Government on 16 December 1941, Governor-General Hans Frank said: [...] "But {{what will happen to}} the Jews? Do you believe they will be lodged in settlements in Ostland? In Berlin, we were told: why all this trouble; we cannot use them in the Ostland or the Reichskommissariat either; liquidate them yourselves!" [...] Two days later, Himmler recorded the outcome of his discussion with Hitler. The result was: [...] "als Partisanen auszurotten" [...] ("exterminate them as partisans"). Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer wrote that the remark is probably as close as historians will <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> a definitive order from Hitler for the genocide carried out during the Holocaust.

2500|$|In 1965, 6th ranked USC (led by Mike Garrett) met 7th ranked UCLA (led by All-Conference sophomore quarterback Gary Beban), with a {{berth in}} the 1966 Rose Bowl on the line. The scoring opened with All-American Tailback Mel Farr running 49 yards for a Bruin touchdown. The extra point was blocked, Despite {{dominating}} in the statistics, USC led only 16–6 with less than 4 {{minutes left in the}} game (In the first 3 1/2 quarters, USC had penetrated inside the UCLA 25 yard line 7 times; 3 times they fumbled, threw one interception in the end zone, settled for a short field goal, and scored 2 touchdowns, missing the extra point on one). On 3rd and 23, [...] UCLA linebacker Dallas Grider hit USC quarterback Troy Winslow and caused a fumble. UCLA scored on a Beban touchdown pass to Dick Witcher and successfully converted a two-point conversion to make the score 16–14 (A tie would have sent USC to the Rose Bowl, hence the reason UCLA went for two). Then Grider then recovered an on-side kick and two plays later, Beban hit Kurt Altenberg, a decoy for Mel Farr, on a 49-yard touchdown bomb to win the game, 20–16. In the final Poll, UCLA was ranked 4th in the AP and 5th in the UPI. UCLA went on to upset #1 ranked Michigan State in the 1966 Rose Bowl, 14–12. USC finished ranked #9 in the AP poll.

2500|$|By 1983, {{the members}} of Hüsker Dü wanted to create music outside of the {{confines}} and restrictions of hardcore. In an interview with Matter in 1983, Mould told interviewer Steve Albini, [...] "We're {{going to try to}} do something bigger than anything like rock & roll and the whole puny touring band idea. I don't know what it's going to be, we have to work that out, but it's going to go beyond the whole idea of 'punk rock' or whatever." [...] The following year, Hüsker Dü recorded the double album Zen Arcade in 45 hours for the cost of $3,200. Zen Arcade is a concept album following a boy who leaves home to face a harsh and unforgiving world. Its artistic and conceptual ambitions were a great stretch given the purist sentiment then prevalent in U.S. punk rock. Zen Arcade received critical praise and significant mainstream music press attention, ending up on several year-end best-of lists. It also helped expand the band's audience beyond the punk community. In his review for Rolling Stone, David Fricke described Zen Arcade as [...] "the closest hardcore will <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> an opera ... a kind of thrash Quadrophenia." [...] In 1989, Zen Arcade was ranked No. 33 on Rolling Stones list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. SST erred on the side of caution and initially pressed between 3,500 and 5,000 copies of the album, but the record sold out a few weeks into the band's tour in support of the record. The album remained out of stock for months afterward, which affected sales and frustrated the band.|$|E
