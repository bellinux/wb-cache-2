5|$|Following the {{awarding}} of the contract, a preliminary design review {{was carried out in}} September 1972, followed by a critical design review in September 1976 after which the engine's design was set and construction of the first set of flight-capable engines began. Final review of all the Space Shuttle's components, including the engines, was conducted in 1979. The design reviews operated in parallel with several test milestones, initial tests consisting of individual engine components which identified shortcomings with various areas of the design, including the HPFTP, HPOTP, valves, nozzle and fuel preburners. The individual <b>engine</b> <b>component</b> tests were followed by the first test of a complete engine (0002) on March 16, 1977. NASA specified that, prior to the Shuttle's first flight, the engines must have undergone at least 65,000 seconds of testing, a milestone that was reached on March 23, 1980, with the engine having undergone 110,253 seconds of testing by the time of STS-1 both on test stands at Stennis Space Center and installed on the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA). The first set of engines (2005, 2006 and 2007) were delivered to Kennedy Space Center in 1979 and installed on , before being removed in 1980 for further testing and reinstalled on the orbiter. The engines, which were of the first manned orbital flight (FMOF) configuration and certified for operation at 100% rated power level (RPL), were operated in a twenty-second flight readiness firing on February 20, 1981, and, after inspection, declared ready for flight.|$|E

25|$|Each car {{taking part}} in Q3 {{receives}} an 'extra' set of the softest available tyre. This set has to be handed in after qualifying, drivers knocked out in Q1 or Q2 can use this set for the race. The first ten drivers, i.e. the drivers through to Q3 must start the race on the tyre which set the fastest time in Q2, unless the weather {{requires the use of}} wet-weather tyres. In which case all of the rules about the tyres won't be followed. All of the drivers that did not participate in Q3 have free tyre choice {{for the start of the}} race. Any penalties that affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying. Grid penalties can be applied for driving infractions in the previous or current Grand Prix, or for changing a gearbox or <b>engine</b> <b>component.</b> If a car fails scrutineering, the driver will be excluded from qualifying, but will be allowed to start the race from the back of the grid at the race steward's discretion.|$|E

25|$|Button {{qualified}} in seventh, {{but took}} a five-place grid penalty {{for changing the}} gearbox in his McLaren. As a result his teammate Magnussen moved into seventh. Despite improving his car's balance, Räikkönen slid several times after a front-end problem could not be rectified, creating understeer, and was restricted to starting eighth. Sutil took ninth and Maldonado, who was the fastest driver not to advance into the final part of qualifying, rounded out the top ten, but slid in turn 19, losing about two-tenths of a second, preventing him from bettering his time. Pérez used two set of super-soft tyres in the first session to ensure he made {{the second part of}} qualifying and took 11th. Hülkenberg was forecast to qualify in the top ten until a tear-off visor wrapped itself around one of his front tyres entering turn 12. He had no grip, ran wide, and lost time, restricting him to qualifying 13th. Kvyat complained of tyre temperature issues after being delayed by slower traffic on his out-lap and could only muster 14th. However, he was handed a ten-place grid penalty for changing an <b>engine</b> <b>component.</b> His teammate Vergne moved into his former starting position and was the fastest driver not to enter the second session by five hundredths of a seconds. Vergne attributed this to changing to an old less powerful engine and excessive oversteer. Esteban Gutiérrez lined up in 15th ahead of Grosjean. Vettel opted to do one lap on soft compound tyres to comply with the 107% rule and took 17th. He started from the pit lane after changing his engine, his sixth of the season.|$|E
2500|$|Racing resumed {{seven minutes}} later with Lieb {{maintaining}} the No. 2 Porsche's advantage over teammate Hartley. Thiim was overtaken by Bruni for the LMGTE Pro lead, while Hartley reduced the time deficit to teammate Lieb to eleven seconds. The No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari was issued with a 20-second time penalty {{after it was}} observed speeding in the pit lane during the full course yellow. Toyota's No. 6 car was pushed into the garage to repair a loose <b>engine</b> <b>component.</b> Sam Bird, in the No. 71 AF Corse car, went off the track and into the turn five gravel trap but recovered to remain in third place in LMGTE Pro. Pizzonia in Manor's No. 44 vehicle passed Leventis's No. 42 Strakka Racing car for third place in LMP2, and the latter fell to fifth after he was overtaken by Derani. A fourth full course yellow was triggered when Lieb attempted to lap Kahled Al-Qubaisi in the No. 88 Abu Dhabi-Proton Racing car but hit him, sending it into the turn six gravel trap. Most of the LMP1 and LMP2 runners made pit stops during the full course yellow. Lieb's front-left dive plane was damaged and required repairs, Audi's No. 7 car had its front bodywork changed and the track was cleaned by marshals.|$|E
