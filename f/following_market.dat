5|$|After the {{division}} arrived in England, Ernest Down was posted to India {{to oversee the}} formation of the 44th Indian Airborne Division, and was replaced by Major General Roy Urquhart. In September 1944, for Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands, the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade was attached to {{the division}}. <b>Following</b> <b>Market</b> Garden, fewer than 2,200 men from the 10,000 that were sent to the Netherlands returned to the British lines. Having suffered such severe casualties, the 4th Parachute Brigade was disbanded, with its surviving men being posted to the 1st Parachute Brigade. The division then went through a period of reorganisation, but had still not fully recovered {{by the end of the}} war, due to the acute shortage of manpower throughout the British Army in 1944-1945. Still under strength in May 1945, it was sent to Norway to disarm the German army of occupation; returning to Britain in November 1945 where the 1st Airborne Division was disbanded.|$|E

The Lincoln Highway through Pennsylvania became PA 1 in 1924. US 30 was designated concurrent with PA 1 west of Philadelphia in 1926, with the PA 1 designation removed two years later. US 30 was widened into a multilane road between York and Lancaster in the 1930s.

In 1967, US 30 was moved to a freeway bypass between Prospect Road east of Columbia and east of Lancaster, with the former alignment becoming PA 462. US 30 was realigned to a freeway between York and Columbia in 1973 and PA 462 was extended west along the former alignment to west of York.

500|$|Killer Instinct Gold was {{developed}} by Rare {{during a time when}} the British company was becoming a prominent second-party developer and ally for Nintendo, the game's publisher. Rare modeled its Killer Instinct series on the Mortal Kombat fighting game series. As a departure from fighting game staples such as Street Fighter, both Killer Instinct and Mortal Kombat championed an aggressively fast pace of gameplay and placed less emphasis on patience and mastery. The Killer Instinct series began as an arcade game (1994) and became known as [...] "Nintendo's version of Mortal Kombat" [...] upon its release on the company's Super NES (1995) and Game Boy (1995). The industry expected a sequel after the Super NES version's wide success, with over three million copies sold. <b>Following</b> <b>market</b> demand, Rare began development on a sequel for the arcade. They had a Super NES version in development, but transitioned to the newer Nintendo64 after the console's announcement. The Killer Instinct development team split itself between the arcade version and the Nintendo64 release that would become Killer Instinct Gold. The latter began work as soon as Rare received its Nintendo64 development kit.|$|E
