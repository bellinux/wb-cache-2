25|$|Salbutamol is the INN (<b>international</b> <b>nonproprietary</b> <b>name)</b> while albuterol is the USAN (United States adopted name). The drug {{is usually}} {{manufactured}} and distributed as the sulphate salt (salbutamol sulphate).|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} {{pharmaceutical}} drugs, there is standardization {{of the drug}} nomenclature for radiopharmaceuticals, although various standards coexist. The <b>International</b> <b>Nonproprietary</b> <b>Name</b> (INN) gives the base drug name, followed by the radioisotope (as atomic weight, no space, element symbol) in parentheses with no superscript, followed by the ligand (if any). It is common to see square brackets and superscript superimposed onto the INN name, because chemical nomenclature (such as IUPAC nomenclature) uses those. The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) name gives the base drug name, followed by the radioisotope (as element symbol, space, atomic weight) with no parentheses, no hyphen, and no superscript, followed by the ligand (if any). The USP style is not the INN style, despite their being described as {{one and the same}} in some publications (e.g., AMA, whose style for radiopharmaceuticals matches the USP style). The United States Pharmacopeial Convention is a sponsor organization of the USAN Council, and the USAN for a given drug is often the same as the USP name.|$|E
2500|$|The {{natural product}} was named {{cyclosporin}} by the German speaking scientists who first isolated it and cyclosporine when translated into English.

50|$|As {{with other}} {{pharmaceutical}} drugs, there is standardization {{of the drug}} nomenclature for radiopharmaceuticals, although various standards coexist. The <b>International</b> <b>Nonproprietary</b> <b>Names</b> (INNs), United States Pharmacopeia (USP) names, and IUPAC names for these agents are usually similar other than trivial style differences. The details are explained at Radiopharmacology § Drug nomenclature for radiopharmaceuticals.|$|R
2500|$|Epinephrine is the pharmaceutical's United States Adopted Name and <b>International</b> <b>Nonproprietary</b> <b>Name,</b> {{though the}} name {{adrenaline}} is frequently used. The term epinephrine was coined by the pharmacologist John Abel (from the Greek for [...] "on {{top of the}} kidneys"), who used the name to describe the extracts he prepared from the adrenal glands as early as 1897. In 1901, Jokichi Takamine patented a purified adrenal extract, and called it [...] "adrenalin" [...] (from the Latin for [...] "on top of the kidneys"), which was trademarked by Parke, Davis & Co in the U.S. In the belief that Abel's extract {{was the same as}} Takamine's, a belief since disputed, epinephrine became the generic name in the U.S. The British Approved Name and European Pharmacopoeia term for this drug is adrenaline and is indeed now one of the few differences between the INN and BAN systems of names.|$|E

2500|$|Most first-generation {{cephalosporins}} {{were originally}} spelled [...] "ceph-" [...] in English-speaking countries. This {{continues to be}} the preferred spelling in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, while European countries (including the United Kingdom) have adopted the <b>International</b> <b>Nonproprietary</b> <b>Names,</b> which are always spelled [...] "cef-". Newer first-generation cephalosporins and all cephalosporins of later generations are spelled [...] "cef-", even in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|European Union {{legislation}} from 2001 required harmonisation of the BP {{with the}} European Pharmacopoeia (EP), {{as well as}} the adoption of <b>International</b> <b>Nonproprietary</b> <b>Names</b> through directives (2001/82/EC [...] and 2001/83/EC, as amended, and 2003/63/EC [...] ). Across the EU has meant that, with the notable exception of adrenaline/epinephrine, BANs are now the same as the INNs. For example, the old BAN methicillin was replaced with the current BAN meticillin, matching the INN.|$|R
50|$|Drug {{nomenclature}} is {{the systematic}} naming of drugs, especially pharmaceutical drugs. Drugs, {{in the majority}} of circumstances, have 3 types of names: chemical names, the most important of which is the IUPAC name; generic or <b>nonproprietary</b> <b>names,</b> the most important of which are the <b>International</b> <b>Nonproprietary</b> <b>Names</b> (INNs); and trade names, which are brand names. Generic names for drugs are nowadays constructed out of affixes and stems that classify the drugs into different categories and also separate drugs within categories. A marketed drug might also have a company code or compound code.|$|R
50|$|The <b>International</b> <b>Nonproprietary</b> <b>Name</b> (INN) of {{methylene}} blue is methylthioninium chloride.|$|E
50|$|Pseudoephedrine is the <b>International</b> <b>Nonproprietary</b> <b>Name</b> of the (+)-form, {{when used}} as {{pharmaceutical}} substance.|$|E
50|$|Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is the <b>International</b> <b>Nonproprietary</b> <b>Name</b> (INN) and co-amoxiclav is the British Approved Name (BAN).|$|E
5|$|This naming {{scheme is}} used for both the World Health Organization’s <b>International</b> <b>Nonproprietary</b> <b>Names</b> (INN) and the United States Adopted Names (USAN) for pharmaceuticals. In general, word stems are used to {{identify}} classes of drugs, in most cases placed word-finally. All monoclonal antibody names end with the stem -mab. Unlike most other pharmaceuticals, monoclonal antibody nomenclature uses different preceding word parts (morphemes) depending on structure and function. These are officially called substems and sometimes erroneously infixes, even by the USAN Council itself.|$|R
5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{introduced}} {{the system of}} <b>International</b> <b>Nonproprietary</b> <b>Names</b> in 1950, with the first INN list being published three years later. The stem -mab for monoclonal antibodies was proposed around 1990, and the current system with target and source substems was developed between 1991 and 1993. Due to the collaboration between the WHO and the United States Adopted Names Council, antibody USANs have the same structure and are largely identical to INNs. Until 2009, more than 170 monoclonal antibodies received names following this nomenclature.|$|R

Kopp-Kubel 1 WHO has {{a constitutional}} mandate to "develop, establish and promote international standards {{with respect to}} biological, pharmaceutical and similar products". The Organization collaborates closely with national nomenclature committees to select a single name of worldwide acceptabiilty for each active substance {{that is to be}} marketed as a pharmaceutical. To avoid confusion, which could jeopardize the safety of patients, trade-marks should neither be derived from INNs nor contain common stems used in INNs. Recent developments in pharmacological research and biotechnology are challenges for the nomenclature committee. New schemes and concepts are being developed, for example, for naming monoclonal antibodies and other recombinant compounds...|$|R
50|$|Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) is a {{synthetic}} antineoplastic agent. Because of its toxicity, it {{cannot be used}} as a drug itself; instead, it is linked to a monoclonal antibody (MAB) which directs it to the cancer cells. In <b>International</b> <b>Nonproprietary</b> <b>Names</b> for MMAE-MAB-conjugates, the name vedotin refers to MMAE plus its linking structure to the antibody. It is a potent antimitotic drug derived from peptides occurring in marine shell-less mollusc Dolabella auricularia called dolastatins which show potent activity in preclinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, against a range of lymphomas, leukemia and solid tumors. These drugs show potency of up to 200 times that of vinblastine, another antimitotic drug used for Hodgkin lymphoma as well as other types of cancer.|$|R
5000|$|Humanized {{antibodies}} are antibodies from non-human species whose protein sequences {{have been}} modified {{to increase their}} similarity to antibody variants produced naturally in humans. The process of [...] "humanization" [...] is usually applied to monoclonal antibodies developed for administration to humans (for example, antibodies developed as anti-cancer drugs). Humanization can be necessary when {{the process of developing}} a specific antibody involves generation in a non-human immune system (such as that in mice). The protein sequences of antibodies produced in this way are partially distinct from homologous antibodies occurring naturally in humans, and are therefore potentially immunogenic when administered to human patients (see also Human anti-mouse antibody). There are other types of antibodies developed. The <b>International</b> <b>Nonproprietary</b> <b>Names</b> of humanized antibodies end in -zumab, as in omalizumab (see Nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} of this work {{is the creation of}} a bilingual (French/English) drug information portal (DIP), in a multi-terminological context. The development of the DIP was based on the CISMeF portal, which catalogues and indexes the most important and quality-controlled sources of institutional health information in French. DIP has created specific functionalities related to drug and used specific drugs terminologies and classifications: the ATC classification, the CAS numbers, the French codes CIS, and CIP, as well as trade <b>names</b> and the <b>International</b> <b>Nonproprietary</b> <b>Names</b> of the drugs. DIP is the result of collaboration between the CISMeF team and the VIDAL private Company, specialized in drug information. DIP is conceived to facilitate the user information retrieval using several health terminologies. In the framework of the drug field, using multi-terminological context, indexing drugs with the appropriate codes or/and terms revealed to be very important to have the appropriate information storage and retrieval...|$|R
