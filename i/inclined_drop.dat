Lastly, the analysis of the patterns of attrition in a sub community showed that attrition was related to the engagement of the particular students with one another. One interpretation of this finding according to Rosé et al. (2014) is that while participating in MOOCs, students create virtual cohorts who progress and engage with the material in similar ways. Thus, if students start dropping out, then that might cause other students to drop out as they might perceive the environment as less supportive or engaging without their peers.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the absence}} of any firm evidence, slate {{probably}} left the quarry by horse and cart or by pack animal during the early phases of the quarry, but in 1868 an agreement was reached with the Cwmorthin Quarry, which would allow the Conglog to lay rails down the valley. As part of the dispute which occurred with Rhosydd Quarry in 1871, they were also given permission to lay rails up to Rhosydd, and to use their incline down to the Croesor Tramway. A prospectus published in 1873 stated that {{it would be easy to}} build a tramway to the Croesor tramway, but this appeared to ignore the fact that the exit tramway from Rhosydd was 1480 ft above sea level, higher than the upper levels of Conglog, and much higher than the mill level. It is not known whether they were related, but Charles John Sims who became a leaseholder of Conglog in 1873, negotiated with the Cwmorthin manager, Joseph F Sims, and an agreement to build a connecting tramway was reached. Rhosydd Quarry had attempted to do the same for many years, and had eventually resorted to the route down Cwm Croesor to the west, because Cwmorthin would not give their consent. The track levels near Cwmorthin Terrace were agreed, as Cwmorthin wanted to build a tramway from their Lake Mill to join the new tramway. Just below the terrace, the new Lake <b>Incline</b> would <b>drop</b> the level to that of Cwmothin's Cross Mill and their exit tramway.|$|R

However, data from such analysis are scarce in open literature. In this paper, results of a study on buckling and fracture behavior of laminated Carbon Fiber Composite (CFC) panels containing ply drops are presented. CFC panels of varying thickness with normal and <b>inclined</b> ply <b>drop</b> were tested under compression loading until buckling and ultimate failure. Nearly simply supported boundary conditions at the ends and along the edges were simulated with the help of specially designed test fixtures.

Back-to-back strain gage output and out-of-plane deformation data were recorded and analyzed to determine the critical buckling loads and corresponding mode shapes. Finite element analysis using MSC NASTRAN was also made in order to predict critical buckling loads and corresponding mode shapes. These results were compared with those obtained from experiments and the agreement was found to be good in most cases. It was also found that under hot-wet conditions, both critical buckling loads and failure loads were lower compared to the room temperature values. 13...|$|R

In this study, the implementation of the dynamic contact angle is extended, accounting for contact line pinning as well as the dynamic behavior in the advancing and receding phase.

The dimensions of drop structure and downstream stilling basin can be optimized if geometric and hydraulic characteristics are recognized properly. In this research, the effects of drop geometry and hydraulic characteristics on the loss due to structure were investigated. At first, the effective dimensionless parameters were specified. 14 physical models of more common <b>drops</b> including straight, <b>inclined</b> and stepped <b>drops</b> were then built in 2 heights of 51. 5 & 25. 5 centimeters and 2 bed slopes of 26. 6 & 33. 7 degrees.

In this process, molten lead is dripped from small orifices and dropped approximately 1 in into a hot liquid, where it is then rolled along an <b>incline</b> and then <b>dropped</b> another 3 ft. The temperature of the liquid controls the cooling rate of the lead, while the surface tension of the liquid and the inclined surface(s) work together to bring the small droplets of lead into highly regular balls of lead in spherical form.

The roundness of the lead shot depends on the angle of the inclined surfaces as well as the temperature of the liquid coolant. Various coolants have successfully been used, ranging from diesel fuel to antifreeze and water-soluble oil. After the lead shot cools, it is washed, then dried, and small amounts of graphite are finally added to prevent clumping of the lead shot.
