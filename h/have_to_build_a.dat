5|$|When Larry Schmittou {{decided to}} bring {{professional}} baseball back to Nashville in the late 1970s, {{he knew he would}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> new ballpark for his team. He negotiated a lease with the city for a plot of land at the foot of St. Cloud Hill on the grounds of Fort Negley, an American Civil War fortification, approximately two miles (three km) south of downtown. At the time, this was the site of a city-owned softball complex that the city planned to relocate. The city was prepared to lease him the land, but Schmittou would be responsible for building the stadium, paying the property taxes, and paying the city a portion of the team's total revenue.|$|E
500|$|Commanding Hewie is an {{integral}} part of Haunting Grounds gameplay. At the beginning of the game, he won't be completely friendly and obey all of Fiona's commands. The player will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> friendship and gain his trust in order to survive the game. Hewie can be told to sniff out items, check suspicious areas or items, attack an enemy, or called back to Fiona's side. The player can praise Hewie by petting and feeding him, both which can heal his vitality. Likewise, he can be scolded when he won't listen to commands. He can be told to [...] "stand ready" [...] before attacking, which will increase his attack power.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Harry. [...] "For one thing, it's quite a {{long way}} to the nearest mill and we'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> skidway for a mile or two down to the water. Besides, in a general way, it's only the redwood and red cedar that the mills have much use for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To be sure," [...] Mr. Merrick replied. [...] "We {{must find}} a proper location, where we can install the presses and all the type and {{machinery}} that go to making up a newspaper. I hadn't thought of this before, {{but it is a}} serious matter, my dears. We may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{depends on}} many things, lad," [...] replied the Captain, laying down his spoon, and leaning {{his back against}} a {{convenient}} rock. [...] "If the ice moves off, I shall adopt one course; if it holds fast I shall try another. Then, {{if you insist on}} gathering and carrying along with you such pocket-loads of specimens, plants, rocks, etcetera, as you've brought in this evening, I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> sort of Noah's ark, or omnibus on sledge-runners, to carry them." ...|$|E

60|$|We may, indeed, {{state it}} briefly thus:--Suppose you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> castle, with towers and roofs and buttresses, out of bricks {{of a given}} shape, and that these bricks are all lying in a huge heap at the bottom, in utter confusion, upset out of carts at random. You would have to draw a great many plans, and count all your bricks, and be sure you had enough for this and that tower, before you began, and then {{you would have to}} lay your foundation, and add layer by layer, in order, slowly.|$|E
6000|$|Maxwell only {{laughed at}} this. [...] "Boston wouldn't serve {{any better than}} Chicago, as far as New York is concerned. We shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> success {{from the ground up}} there, if we get one. It might run a whole winter in Boston, and then we should {{probably}} begin with half a house in New York, or a third. The only advantage of trying it anywhere before, is that the actors will be warm in their parts. Besides, do you suppose Godolphin could get a theatre in Boston out of the order of his engagement there next spring?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was a house}} {{agent in}} Dover who finally decided Kipps to build. Kipps, with a certain faltering in his voice, had {{delivered}} his ultimatum, no basement, not more than eight rooms, hot and cold water upstairs, coal cellar in the house but with intervening doors to keep dust from the scullery and so forth. He stood blowing. [...] "You'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> house," [...] said the house agent, sighing wearily, [...] "if you want all that." [...] It was rather {{for the sake of}} effective answer than with any intention at the time that Kipps mumbled, [...] "That's about what I shall do--this goes on." ...|$|E

We launched this platform to {{a limited number of}} sellers and in that time, we <b>have</b> learned how <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> truly revolutionary Nigerian online marketplace…” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{she ever}} consent to have me," [...] said Guert, {{actually}} sighing as he spoke, and glancing his eyes round the very pretty little parlour I {{had just been}} praising, {{on the occasion of}} the visit I first made to his residence that afternoon; [...] "if she ever consent to have me, Corny, I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> new house. This is now a hundred years old, and though it was thought a great affair in its day, it is not half good enough for Mary Wallace. My dear fellow, how I; envy you that invitation to breakfast this morning! what a favourite you must be with Herman Mordaunt!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Judge Brown {{kept out}} of it. [...] "I don't want to seem too {{prominent}} in this campaign," [...] he said to Colonel Peavey. [...] "We old Mohawks are a damage to any man's campaign just now. The time is coming, Colonel, when we'll help, but not now. We've set the mischief afoot; now let the young fellows and the farmers {{do the rest of}} it. Besides, my young man here is quite able to look out for himself. All that scares me is he'll get too radical, even for the Democracy, one of these days. If he does, all is we'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> party up to his principle, for he'll be right, Colonel; there's no two ways about that." ...|$|E
60|$|Jerry Muskrat {{was very}} much {{interested}} when he found that Paddy the Beaver, who you know, is his cousin, was building a house. Jerry is a house-builder himself, and down deep in his heart he very much doubted if Paddy could build as good a house as he could. His house was down in the Smiling Pool, and Jerry thought it a very wonderful house indeed, and {{was very proud of}} it. It was built of mud and sod and little alder and willow twigs and bulrushes. Jerry had spent one winter in it, and he had decided to spend another there after he had fixed it up a little. So, as long as he didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> brand-new house, he could afford the time to watch his cousin Paddy. Perhaps he hoped that Paddy would ask his advice.|$|E

50|$|Before long {{these two}} topics converged into {{the idea that}} they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>an</b> armed anti-Japanese movement. In January 1971 they were among other things {{undertaking}} their first experiments with homemade bombs.|$|R
50|$|For {{their final}} task at the Wigwam Valley Ranch, teams <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> fire, and then {{completely}} <b>build</b> <b>a</b> teepee, using a completed one for reference. Teams {{would spend the}} night in these teepees.|$|R
60|$|AFTER {{my return}} from Gilolo to Ternate, in March 1858, I made {{arrangements}} for my long-wished-for voyage {{to the mainland}} of New Guinea, where I anticipated that my collections would surpass those which I had formed at the Aru Islands. The poverty of Ternate in articles used by Europeans was shown, by my searching in vain through all the stores for such common things as flour, metal spoons, wide-mouthed phials, beeswax, a penknife, and a stone or metal pestle and mortar. I took with me four servants: my head man Ali, and a Ternate lad named Jumaat (Friday), to shoot; Lahagi, a steady middle-aged man, to cut timber and assist me in insect-collecting; and Loisa, a Javanese cook. As I knew I should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> house at Dorey, where I was going, I took with me eighty cadjans, or waterproof mats, made of pandanus leaves, to cover over my baggage on first landing, and to help to roof my house afterwards.|$|E
60|$|He was angry, {{and cursed}} his luck aloud. He {{had hoped to}} get into camp with the boys at six o’clock, and this would delay him an hour, for he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> fire and dry out his foot-gear. This was {{imperative}} at that low temperature—he knew that much; and he turned aside to the bank, which he climbed. On top, tangled in the underbrush about the trunks of several small spruce trees, was a high-water deposit of dry firewood—sticks and twigs principally, but also larger portions of seasoned branches and fine, dry, last-year’s grasses. He threw down several large pieces {{on top of the}} snow. This served for a foundation and prevented the young flame from drowning itself in the snow it otherwise would melt. The flame he got by touching a match to a small shred of birch-bark that he took from his pocket. This burned even more readily than paper. Placing it on the foundation, he fed the young flame with wisps of dry grass and with the tiniest dry twigs.|$|E
