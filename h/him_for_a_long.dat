5|$|How {{great the}} glory of Origen was, appears {{from the fact that}} Firmilianus, bishop of Cæsarea, with all the Cappadocian bishops, sought a visit from him, and entertained <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while. Sometime afterwards, going to Palestine to visit the holy places, he came to Cæsarea and was {{instructed}} at length by Origen in the Holy Scriptures. It appears also from the fact that he went to Antioch, on the request of Mammaea, mother of the Emperor Alexander, and a woman religiously disposed, and was there held in great honour, and sent letters to the Emperor Philip, who was the first among the Roman rulers, to become a Christian, and to his mother, letters which are still extant.|$|E

Rhys is annoyed by Susan's interference with his patient and Barber told a columnist for Inside Soap [...] "He wants him to have chemotherapy, but Karl tells Susan it will only prolong Jim's suffering, not save his life.

However, the Greek state {{after the fall of}} the Colonels did not honor <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. For instance, his actions are not mentioned in school textbooks, with very few exceptions. There is still growing suspicion regarding this, given that a minority of active current politicians in Greece are allegedly linked to the Colonels' regime and do not wish to promote Panagoulis' deeds. The Greek Ministry of Culture (under the minister Evangelos Venizelos) refused to contribute €1,500 in order to facilitate the translated publication of Panagoulis' poems. This has changed during the last years: by 2008, 22 streets in Athens and its suburbs are named after him and a metro station in Athens (Agios Dimitrios, which is close to the place of his death) was renamed to carry his name (...)

The Cathedral administrator, Monsignor Charles Drennan, said that engineers had indicated that it was unlikely the building could be saved. The two bell towers {{at the front of}} the building collapsed, bringing much of the front façade down with them, with large blocks of masonry destroying vehicles in front of the building. There was also major cracking evident around the Cathedral's main dome. Stained glass windows, which had survived the 4 September earthquake and some 4,000 aftershocks, were also [...] "in ruins". Monsignor Drennan said that workers repairing {{damage to the}} building caused by the earlier earthquake, escaped, as did a custodian who was in the Cathedral at the time.

2500|$|Elvis and Priscilla Ann Beaulieu {{first met}} in 1959 while Elvis was {{stationed}} in Germany with the U.S. Army. Priscilla was 14 years old when Elvis met her. Elvis' relationships with young women were pointed in [...] "In his love life," [...] by Reuben Fine, who observed that Elvis [...] "quickly became attached to teenage girls, and he loved to have them wearing white panties in bed with <b>him.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time {{he would not have}} sex with them, whom he described as 'jail bait.' [...] " [...] In similar terms, Brent D. Taylor has stated that [...] "Elvis's closest female relationships were usually with young girls of around 13 or 14, ending as they reached late teens. He didn't have sex with these young girls, but had pajama parties, pillow fights and indulged in 'girl talk', just as he did with Gladys." [...] "As a perpetual youth", Elvis was [...] "attracted to young women", and [...] "Elvis felt comfortable with these adolescent girls" [...] because he [...] "was so insecure ... That’s why he needed younger girls." [...] Elvis biographer Alanna Nash also confirms that the singer had a predilection for young adolescent girls. The author says that Presley was overly attached to his mother and could not relate normally to mature women; presumably, Presley sought out very young girls because he felt threatened by women who were older.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on 15 November 2010. In addition, Egan fully expressed what he felt on during recording Gravity: [...] "It’s hard to believe this is our 11th album but performing is our passion and it would seem like throwing it all away if we stopped."“Both us and Take That go for epic pop songs but them taking Robbie back hasn’t made us think about Brian McFadden returning. It would feel odd to have a fifth person back on stage with us". In addition Westlife told Digital Spy: [...] "We'd {{wanted to work with}} <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, but all his loyalty was to Take That and he didn't want to work with another boyband," [...] "We'd been asking him and asking, but literally within moments of Take That deciding to go and work with Stuart Price, he said yes to us straight away. Afterwards he said he'd wanted to work with us for a long time, but he just couldn't do the Take That thing and the Westlife thing because they were too close." [...] "John created a sound for us in the same way he created a sound for Take That, a sound for Bon Jovi and a sound for all the other incredible artists he's worked with," [...] "He created a sound for Westlife that we haven't had before - it's not a massive departure, but it's definitely a step up in terms of production." [...] Filan also revealed that the group is currently in the process of selecting 12 or 13 songs for the album's final track listing from a pool of 16, with all but [...] "one or two" [...] likely to be originals. On 22 October 2010, Shanks stated that they have finished the Westlife record, all approved by Cowell. Shanks stated that the album ended up with two covers in it. On 27 October 2010, the album main release date was changed to 22 November 2010. On 25 October 2010, Feehily unveiled the final track listing on his official Twitter page as follows: On 1 November 2010, Mark confirmed the two cover songs on the album are, [...] "Chances" [...] by Athlete and [...] "The Reason" [...] by Hoobastank.
