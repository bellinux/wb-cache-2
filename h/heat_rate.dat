40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{starting}} powder particle size and <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> on spark plasma sintering of Fe-Ni alloys was investigated, with the particle powder size varying from 3 to 70 μm and <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> from 50 to 150 °C/min. The {{effect of the}} starting powder particle size was more obvious when comparing 3 -FeNi and 70 -FeNi at all <b>heating</b> <b>rates,</b> with the former having better density and hardness than the latter. Sintered densities close to theoretical (≥ 99 %) were achieved for a <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> of 50 °C/min for the different starting particle size powders, and decreased with increasing <b>heating</b> <b>rate.</b> The average grain size of alloys sintered at 150 °C/min was ~ 34 % smaller than those sintered at 50 °C/min. The porosity content of the sintered samples increased with increasing heating for the same particle size. The shrinkage rate depends on both <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> and particle size. At a particle size of 3 μm and a <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> of 50 oC/min, three peaks were observed indicative of the phenomena responsible for good densification. As the <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> increases, only two peaks and one peak are observed at <b>heating</b> <b>rates</b> of 100 and 150 oC/min, respectively. This suggests that, unlike high <b>heating</b> <b>rates,</b> the longer processing time at low <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> allows the three phenomena to take place. The hardness measurement revealed a steady decrease with increasing <b>heating</b> <b>rate.</b> At a <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> of 150 °C/min the particles were well packed but no typical dimple structure of a ductile material was observed. However, for samples sintered at 50 and 100 °C/min a typical dimple fracture morphology was observed...|$|R

Although the effect of <b>heating</b> <b>rates</b> has been scarcely explored by the scientific community, recent researches have unraveled its important effect on the thermal {{resistance of}} different species of vegetative bacteria.

The aim {{of this research was}} to explore the effect of different <b>heating</b> <b>rates,</b> such as those currently achieved in the heat exchangers used in the food industry, on the heat resistance of Escherichia coli. A pilot plant tubular heat exchanger and a thermoresistometer Mastia were used for this purpose. Results showed that fast <b>heating</b> <b>rates</b> had a deep impact on the thermal resistance of E. coli. <b>Heating</b> <b>rates</b> between 20 and 50 ºC/min were achieved in the heat exchanger, which were much slower than those around 20 ºC/s achieved in the thermoresistometer. In all cases, these high <b>heating</b> <b>rates</b> led to higher inactivation than expected: in the heat exchanger, for all the experiments performed, when the observed inactivation had reached about seven log cycles, the predictions estimates about 1 log cycle of inactivation; in the thermoresistometer these differences between observed and predicted values were even more than ten times higher, from 4. 07 log cycles observed to 0. 34 predicted at a flow rate of 70 mL/min and a maximum <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> of 14. 7 ºC/s.

40|$|The {{so-called}} micro {{fluidized bed}} reaction analyzer (MFBRA) and a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) were adopted to comparatively investigate the non-isothermal gasification of coal char with CO 2. Experimental results demonstrated that <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> obviously affected the coal char gasification reaction. Raising <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> evidently increased the temperatures at the initiating reaction (T-i), the maximal reaction rate (T-m) and the finishing reaction (T-f).
