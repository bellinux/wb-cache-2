He {{was not a}} playgoer, {{being of}} such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad <b>filling-up</b> of the {{inferior}} parts. While preparing for our departure from England, however, he saw Miss O'Neil several times. She was then in the zenith of her glory; and Shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts, and by the graceful sweetness, the intense pathos, the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed. She was often in his thoughts as he wrote: and, when he had finished, he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted, and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill {{the part of the}} heroine. With this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in London: ...|$|E
60|$|In the <b>filling-up</b> {{of such an}} outline, {{there was}} scope enough for diligence. But {{it was not in}} Schiller's nature to content himself with {{ordinary}} efforts; no sooner did a project take hold of his mind, than, rallying round it all his accomplishments and capabilities, he stretched it out into something so magnificent and comprehensive, that little less than a lifetime would have been sufficient to effect it. This History of the Revolt of the Netherlands, which formed his chief study, he looked upon but as one branch of the great subject he was yet destined to engage with. History at large, in all its bearings, was now his final aim; and his mind was continually occupied with plans for acquiring, improving, and diffusing the knowledge of it.|$|E
60|$|The Abbé St. Réal was a {{dexterous}} {{artist in}} that half-illicit species of composition, the historic novel: {{in the course}} of his operations, he lighted on these incidents; and, by <b>filling-up</b> according to his fancy, what historians had only sketched to him, by amplifying, beautifying, suppressing, and arranging, he worked the whole into a striking little narrative, distinguished by all the symmetry, the sparkling graces, the vigorous description, and keen thought, which characterise his other writings. This French Sallust, as his countrymen have named him, has been of use to many dramatists. His Conjuraison contre Venise furnished Otway with the outline of his best tragedy; Epicaris has more than once appeared upon the stage; and Don Carlos has been dramatised in almost all the languages of Europe. Besides Otway's Carlos so famous at its first appearance, many tragedies on this subject have been written: most of them are gathered to their final rest; some are fast going thither; two bid fair to last for ages. Schiller and Alfieri have both drawn their plot from St. Réal; the former has expanded and added; the latter has compressed and abbreviated.|$|E
60|$|It is {{scarcely}} necessary to say that, {{in a country}} where the laws favor all commendable enterprise, where unnecessary artificial restrictions are unknown, and where the hand of man has not yet exhausted its efforts, the adventurer is allowed the greatest freedom of choice, in selecting the field of his enterprise. The agriculturist passes the heath and the barren, to seat himself on the river-bottom; the trader looks for the site of demand and supply and the artisan quits his native village to seek employment in situations where labor will meet its fullest reward. It is a consequence of this extraordinary freedom of election, that, while the great picture of American society has been sketched with so much boldness, a large portion of the <b>filling-up</b> still remains to be done. The emigrant has consulted his immediate interests; and, while no very extensive and profitable territory, throughout the whole of our immense possessions, has been wholly neglected, neither has any particular district yet attained the finish of improvement. The city is even now, seen in the wilderness, and the wilderness often continues near the city, while the latter is sending forth its swarms to distant scenes of industry. After thirty years of fostering care on the part of the government, the Capital, itself, presents its disjointed and sickly villages, in the centre of the deserted 'old-fields' of Maryland, while numberless youthful rivals are flourishing on the waters of the West, in spots where the bear has ranged and the wolf howled, long since the former has been termed a city.|$|E
60|$|How did he {{know that}} Isabel was his sister? Setting aside Aunt Dorothea's nebulous legend, to which, in some shadowy points, here and there Isabel's still more nebulous story seemed to fit on,--though but uncertainly enough--and both of which thus blurredly conjoining narrations, {{regarded}} in the unscrupulous light of real naked reason, were any thing but legitimately conclusive; and setting aside his own dim reminiscences of his wandering father's death-bed; (for though, in one point of view, those reminiscences might have afforded some degree of presumption as to his father's having been the parent of an unacknowledged daughter, yet were they entirely inconclusive as to that presumed daughter's identity; and the grand point now with Pierre was, not the general question whether his father had had a daughter, but whether, assuming that he had had, Isabel, rather than any other living being, was that daughter;)--and setting aside all his own manifold and inter-enfolding mystic and transcendental persuasions,--originally born, as he now seemed to feel, purely of an intense procreative enthusiasm:--an enthusiasm no longer so all-potential with him as of yore; setting all these aside, and coming to the plain, palpable facts,--how {{did he know}} that Isabel was his sister? Nothing that he saw in her face could he remember as having seen in his father's. The chair-portrait, that was the entire sum and substance of all possible, rakable, downright presumptive evidence, which peculiarly appealed to his own separate self. Yet here was another portrait of a complete stranger--a European; a portrait imported from across the seas, and to be sold at public auction, which was just as strong an evidence as the other. Then, the original of this second portrait was as much the father of Isabel as the original of the chair-portrait. But perhaps there was no original at all to this second portrait; {{it might have been}} a pure fancy piece; to which conceit, indeed, the uncharacterizing style of the <b>filling-up</b> seemed to furnish no small testimony.|$|E

Logicians see type theory as interesting because it offers a foundation for constructive mathematics and its formalization. For computer scientists, type theory promises to provide a uniform framework for programs, proofs, specifications, and their development.

40|$|Abstract. The post-glacial {{transgression}} up to {{the present}} sea level, which occurred about 5500 years B. P., deeply modified the coastal zone morphology, especially in the river mouth region, where, in a few millennia, the geographical pattern changed from an open bay to a delta environment. The Salum islands case illustrates this evolution. Sediments deposits and anthropic shell-middens, built in a time interval starting 6000 years B. P. up to now, based on radiocarbon dating, provide a chronological framework of the delta evolution. At first, the open post-transgression bay was subject to <b>filling-up.</b> A major second stage, occurring not later than 2550 years B. P., is characterized by the formation of beach barriers. The third stage is the completion of the <b>filling-up</b> behind the beach barriers. The whole construction is under the distinct influences first, of the Sahelian and the Salum River sediment fluxes in the Northern part of the delta and then, the Gambia River sediment input in the Southern part. Detailed analyses of the sediment testify to this double origin of the various morphosedimentary exhibited units: tidal flats and beach barriers. Grain-size analysis, SEM examination and heavy mineral assemblages revealed sand as the dominant component in the Northern part. It originated from atmospheric and fluvial conditions favouring the coarse component input. To the South, a clay dominant influx, controlled by the Gambia River discharge, is responsible for back-barrier mud-flats, accumulated in relation to the reduction or the absence of the tide-dominated fluvial processes in the Salum River. Hence, the Diomboss arm does not form one of the delta distributaries between the Northern and the Southern part as previously considered but a residual space of the former mid-Holocene bay, separating the real Salum River delta to the North and the pre-Gambian delta to the South. All morphological units described in the delta are established at a level located within the present tidal range. There is no need to refer to sea level variations to explain the geomorphologic pattern. The sedimentological input and forcing seem to be the major agents of sedimentary unit distribution...|$|E

40|$|With {{the fast}} growing {{progress}} of computer technologies, spatial information on watersheds such as flow direction, watershed boundaries and the drainage network can be automatically calculated or extracted from a {{digital elevation model}} (DEM). The stubborn problem that depressions exist in DEMs has been frequently encountered while extracting the spatial information of terrain. Several <b>filling-up</b> methods have been proposed for solving depressions. However, their suitability for large-scale flat areas is inadequate. This study proposes a depression watershed method coupled with the Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEEs) theory to determine the optimal outlet and calculate the flow direction in depressions. Three processing procedures are used to derive the depressionless, flow direction: (1) calculating the incipient flow direction; (2) establishing the depression watershed by tracing the upstream drainage area and determining the depression outlet using PROMETHEE theory; (3) calculating the depressionless flow direction. The developed method was used to delineate the Shihmen Reservoir watershed located in Northern Taiwan. The {{results show that the}} depression watershed method can effectively solve the shortcomings such as depression outlet differentiating and looped flow direction between depressions.

In the pre-filling phase, the community was more homogeneous along the downstream river gradient, and spatial compartmentalization in the new reservoir was common during the post-filling phase. From 140 identified taxa, 10 species occurred exclusively in the pre-filling phase and 32 in the post-filling phase. After completion of the fifth reservoir <b>filling-up,</b> opportunistic, pioneer and fast-developing species quickly dominated, and downstream of the fourth reservoir the pre-filling decreasing gradient of richness, diversity and evenness disappeared. Richness of rotifers and cladocerans, cladocerans diversity, and evenness of rotifers, cladocerans and copepods were generally higher in the post-filling phase. A non-metric multidimensional analysis based on a presence/absence matrix depicted a homogeneous and dense group of species associated to the pre-filling phase and a second, dispersed group related to the post-filling phase. Spearman correlations pointed out significant positive effects of transparency on rotifer species richness in the post-filling phase, and negative effects on the microcrustacean richness in the pre-filling phase. Dam construction caused disruption of the downstream lotic gradient along the series of dams, leading to the development of distinct species in lentic spatial compartments...|$|E
40|$|The linear-sigma model, {{in which}} {{information}} about confining gluons is included through the Polyakov-loop potential (PLSM), is considered {{in order to}} perform a systematic study for various magnetic properties of QCD matter under extreme conditions of high temperatures and densities and finite magnetic field strengths. The introduction of magnetic field to the PLSM Lagrangian requires suitable utilization of Landau quantization, modification in the dispersion relations, and momentum-space dimension-reduction. We observed that increasing the magnetic field leads to <b>filling-up</b> lower Landau levels first and decreasing the number of occupied levels. We conclude that the population of Landau levels is most sensitive to the magnetic field and to the quark charges. The influences of finite magnetic field on the temperature dependence of chiral and deconfinement order-parameter(s) are studied. We present estimations for the magnetization, the magnetic susceptibility, the permeability and the catalysis properties of QCD matter as functions of temperature. The dependences of the resulting freezeout parameters, temperatures and baryon chemical potentials on the corresponding magnetic field strengths have been analyzed, as well. These calculations are compared with recent lattice QCD simulations, whenever available. We conclude that the QCD matter seems to have paramagnetic property at temperatures greater than the critical one. There is an evidence for weak diamagnetic property at low temperatures. Last but not least, we observe that the magnetic catalysis is inverse, namely the critical temperatures decrease with increasing the magnetic field.

40|$|Abstract — Shrinkage is the {{time-dependant}} {{decrease in}} concrete volume {{compared with the}} original placement volume of concrete. Shrinkage potential of a high performance concrete {{is perhaps the most}} important consideration which affects the long-term strength and durability, and hence efforts are being made to reduce the shrinkage and shrinkage cracks. The main objective of this experimental work was to investigate the shrinkage properties of concrete made with granite powder as fine aggregate and partial replacement of cement with combination of admixtures. The granite powder, one of the byproducts in stone crushing process, not being used for any applications other than <b>filling-up</b> low lying areas was identified as a replacement material for river sand in concrete. Admixtures such as silica fume, fly ash, slag and superplasticiser have the inherent ability to contribute to continued strength development and very high durability. In the present work, concrete made with 25 % of granite powder as a replacement of sand and with 10 % of Fly ash, 10 % of ground granulated blast-furnace slag, 7. 5 % of silica fume and 1 % of superplasticiser as a replacement of cement were considered. The results indicated that concrete specimens produced with admixture and granite powder has lesser shrinkage parameters like maximum length of crack, minimum width of crack, total number of cracks as compared with conventional concrete specimens. The test results also indicated that the values of both plastic and drying shrinkage strains of concrete in the granite powder with admixture concrete specimens were greater than those of ordinary concrete specimens...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the {{vicinity}} of the Barkedji village (in the Ferlo region of Senegal), the abundance and aggressiveness of the vector mosquitoes for Rift Valley fever (RVF) are strongly linked to rainfall events and associated ponds dynamics. Initially, these results were obtained from spectral analysis of high-resolution (~ 10 m) Spot- 5 images, but, {{as a part of the}} French AdaptFVR project, identification of the free water dynamics within ponds was made with the new high-resolution (down to 3 -meter pixels), Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite (TerraSAR-X) produced by Infoterra GmbH, Friedrichshafen/Potsdam, Germany. During summer 2008, within a 30 x 50 km radar image, it was found that identified free water fell well within the footprints of ponds localized by optical data (i. e. Spot- 5 images), which increased the confidence in this new and complementary remote sensing technique. Moreover, by using near real-time rainfall data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), NASA/JAXA joint mission, the <b>filling-up</b> and flushingout rates of the ponds can be accurately determined. The latter allows for a precise, spatio-temporal mapping of the zones potentially occupied by mosquitoes capable of revealing the variability of pond surfaces. The risk for RVF infection of gathered bovines and small ruminants (~ 1 park/km 2) can thus be assessed. This new operational approach (which is independent of weather conditions) is an important development in the mapping of risk components (i. e. hazards plus vulnerability) related to RVF transmission during the summer monsoon, thus contributing to a RVF early warning system...|$|E
40|$|Ethylene oxide (EO) {{is a very}} {{versatile}} compound {{with considerable}} energy in its ring structure. Its reactions proceed mainly via ring opening and are highly exothermic. Under some conditions, it is known to undergo a variety of reactions, such as isomerization, polymerization, hydrolysis, combustion and decomposition Due to its very reactive characteristic and widely industrial applications, EO {{has been involved in}} a number of serious incidents such as Doe Run 1962, Freeport 1974, Deer Park 1988 and Union Carbide Corporation?s Seadrift 1991. The impacts can be severe in terms of death and injury to people, damage to physical property and effects on the environment. For instance, the Union Carbide incident in 1991 caused one fatality and extensive damage to the plant with the property damage of up to 80 million dollars. Contamination has a considerable impact on EO reactivity by accelerating substantially its decomposition and playing a key role on EO incidents. In this work, the reactivity of EO with contaminants such as KOH, NaOH, NH 4 OH, and EDTA is evaluated. Useful information that is critical to the design and operation of safer chemical plant processes was generated such as safe storage temperatures (onset temperature), maximum temperature, maximum pressure, temperature vs. time, heat and pressure generation rates as a function of temperature and time to maximum rate using adiabatic calorimetry. A special arrangement for the <b>filling-up</b> of the cell was constructed due to the gaseous nature and toxicity of EO. A comparison of their thermal behavior is also presented since several contaminants are studied...|$|E

40|$|The {{biology of}} most {{invasive}} species {{in their native}} geographical areas remains largely unknown. Such studies are, however, crucial in shedding light on the ecological and evolutionary processes underlying biological invasions. 2. The present study focuses on the little fire ant Wasmannia auropunctata, a species native to Central and South America that has been widely introduced and which has become invasive throughout the tropics. We characterise and compare several ecological traits of native populations in French Guiana with those {{in one of its}} introduced ranges, New Caledonia. 3. We found ecologically heterogeneous populations of W. auropunctata coexisting in the species' native geographical area. First, we found populations restricted to naturally perturbed areas (particularly floodplains) within the primary forest, and absent from the surrounding forest areas. These populations were characterised by low nest and worker densities. Second, we found dominant populations in recent anthropogenic areas (e. g. secondary forest or forest edge along road) characterised by high nest and worker densities, and associated with low ant species richness. The local dominance of W. auropunctata in such areas can be due to the displacement of other species (cause) or the <b>filling-up</b> of empty habitats unsuitable to other ants (effect). With respect to their demographic features and ant species richness, the populations of native anthropogenic habitats were to a large extent similar to the invasive populations introduced into remote areas. 4. The results point to the need for greater research efforts to better understand the ecological and demographic features of invasive species within their native ranges. © 2009 The Royal Entomological Society.
