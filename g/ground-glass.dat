25|$|Although CAD {{has been}} used in {{clinical}} environments for over 40 years, CAD usually does not substitute the doctor or other professional, but rather plays a supporting role. The professional (generally a radiologist) is generally responsible for the final interpretation of a medical image. However, the goal of some CAD systems is to detect earliest signs of abnormality in patients that human professionals cannot, as in diabetic retinopathy, architectural distortion in mammograms, <b>ground-glass</b> nodules in thoracic CT, and non-polypoid (“flat”) lesions in CT colonography.|$|E
25|$|Procedures to {{diagnose}} and treat small pulmonary nodules have also recently been performed in hybrid operating rooms. Interventional image guidance thereby offers {{the advantage of}} precisely knowing {{the position of the}} nodules, particularly in small or <b>ground-glass</b> opaque tumors, metastases, and/or patients with reduced pulmonary function. This allows for a precise navigation in biopsies, and resection in VATS. Most importantly, using interventional imaging in VATS can substitute for the loss of tactile sensing. This new approach also delivers the potential to spare healthy lung tissue by knowing the exact position of the nodule which increases {{the quality of life for}} the patient after the operation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} days of the Empire, the {{technical}} proficiency and artistic excesses of the traditional stained glass artists reached their height. The great windows of this period demonstrate a mastery over figure drawing and stained glass painting. The artists had developed ways of achieving every possible textural effect through the expert application of <b>ground-glass</b> paint and yellow-stain:- babies’ ringlets, old men's beards, silk brocade, dove's feather, ripe grapes, gold braid, glowing pearls and greasy sheep's wool could all be painted to realistic perfection by any number of studios. Many windows of the Edwardian period are the most opulent creations of the stained glass industry. The youthful Virgin of the Annunciation, Peter the fisherman, John the itinerant preacher and Joseph the carpenter are all depicted in robes of the most sumptuous nature, lined with cloth of gold and lavishly decorated at the edges with rubies and pearls.|$|E
25|$|VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) is a minimally-invasive {{technique}} to resect lung nodules that saves the patient {{the trauma of}} a thoracotomy. Thereby, small ports are used to access the pulmonary lobes and introduce a camera on a thoracoscope, along with the necessary instruments. While this procedure speeds up recovery and potentially reduces complications, the loss of natural vision and tactile sensing {{makes it difficult for}} the surgeon to locate the nodules, especially in cases of non-superficial, <b>ground-glass</b> opaque, and small lesions. The yield rate for nodules < 1nbsp&cm can be below 40% as studies show. As a consequence sometimes more healthy tissue is resected than actually necessary in order to avoid missing (parts of) the lesion. Using advanced intra-operative imaging in the OR helps to precisely locate and resect the lesion in a potentially tissue-sparing and quick fashion. In {{order to be able to}} use image guidance during VATS, rotational angiography has to be performed before the introduction of ports, thus before the lobe in question deflates. This way the lesion is visible through the natural contrast of air. In a second step, hook wires, thread needles, or contrast agent (Lipiodol, Iopamidol) are introduced into or next to the lesion to ensure visibility on the angiogram after lung deflation. Then, the conventional part of VATS starts with the introduction of thoracoscopes. The imaging system is used in fluoroscopic mode now, where both the inserted instruments and the previously marked lesion are well visible. A precise resection is now possible. In case contrast agent has been used to mark the lesion, it will also drain into the regional lymph nodes, which then can be resected within the same procedure.|$|E
500|$|Pigments {{bound in}} glue had an optical quality that {{rendered}} [...] them opaque in appearance and unusually vivid. Unlike oil, which makes chalk appear translucent, chalk mixed in glue is rendered as stark white. Similarly, [...] more expensive pigments assume brilliant opacity in a glue medium. [...] The whites are chalk in areas mixed with lead white, {{especially in the}} Magdalen's mantle and veil, Christ's shroud and the Virgin's veil. The artist used four blue pigments, an unusual number for paintings of the period, with indigo predominating. [...] As a plant-derived pigment, indigo it {{has a tendency to}} fade over time. Azurite and lead-white line the under-paint, while the landscape contains indigo mixed with lead-tin yellow. The sky and Nicodemus' collar are painted with lighter and less intense azurite, while the Virgin's dress is azurite mixed with ultramarine and smalt, a blue <b>ground-glass</b> pigment. The Entombment is one of the earliest Western pictorial works of art in which the use of smalt could be ascertained and its presence proves that the pigment was not invented during the sixteenth century, as had previously been believed.|$|E
2500|$|The above Zenit {{was based}} on the Zorki {{rangefinder}} camera (a copy of the Leica II). In transforming the Zorki into an SLR, the simplest approach was taken: the rangefinder housing was removed from the top and replaced by a plain <b>ground-glass</b> screen and prism; a mirror was added below, with a rope-and-pulley setting system [...] and the M39×1 thread mount was pushed forward {{to make room for the}} mirror inside.|$|E
2500|$|Acute silicosis: Silicosis that {{develops}} {{a few weeks}} to 5 years after exposure to high concentrations of respirable silica dust. [...] This is also known as silicoproteinosis. Symptoms of acute silicosis include more rapid onset of severe disabling shortness of breath, cough, weakness, and weight loss, often leading to death. The x-ray usually reveals a diffuse alveolar filling with air bronchograms, described as a <b>ground-glass</b> appearance, and similar to pneumonia, pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage, and alveolar cell lung cancer.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Lapham, {{somewhat}} absently. He put out {{his huge}} foot and pushed the <b>ground-glass</b> door shut between his little den and the book-keepers, in their larger den outside.|$|E
60|$|Putney glanced {{through a}} little {{transparent}} {{space in the}} <b>ground-glass</b> windows framing the room, which Mr. Gerrish used for {{keeping an eye on}} his sales-ladies to see that they did not sit down.|$|E
6000|$|The young oarsman found Alexander Slocum's set {{of offices}} {{located on the}} top floor of an old-fashioned four-story office building. There was an elevator, however, and this Jerry used and soon found himself in front of a <b>ground-glass</b> door, which bore the sign: ...|$|E
60|$|Longfellow, reminiscent, polish'd, elegant, {{with the}} air of finest {{conventional}} library, picture-gallery or parlor, with ladies and gentlemen in them, and plush and rosewood, and <b>ground-glass</b> lamps, and mahogany and ebony furniture, and a silver inkstand and scented satin paper to write on.|$|E
6000|$|This to {{a splendid}} flunkey, all in {{inflamed}} plush and buttons and knee-breeches {{as to his}} trunk, and a glinting white frost-work of <b>ground-glass</b> paste as to his head, who stood with his heels together and {{the upper half of}} him bent forward, a salver in his hands: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{walls of}} the {{apartment}} were completely hung with splendid tapestries which hid any windows or doors which may have pierced them. The room was lighted by imprisoned rays of sunshine held between the ceiling proper and {{what appeared to be}} a <b>ground-glass</b> false ceiling a few inches below.|$|E
60|$|He stepped lightly before Annie and Mrs. Munger, {{and pushed}} open the <b>ground-glass</b> door of his office for them. It was like a bank parlour, except for Mrs. Gerrish sitting in her husband's leather-cushioned swivel chair, with her last-born in her lap; she greeted the others noisily, without trying to rise.|$|E
6000|$|Stephen {{looked around}} him: at the dusty {{books on the}} shelves, and the still dustier books heaped on Mr. Richter's big table; at the cuspidors; at the {{engravings}} of Washington and Webster; at {{the window in the}} jog which looked out on the court-house square; and finally at another <b>ground-glass</b> door on which was printed: ...|$|E
6000|$|On one of {{the floors}} in {{one of the}} {{buildings}} {{in one of the}} streets that slope precipitously from the Strand to the Thames Embankment, there is a door that would be all the better for a lick of paint, which bears what is perhaps the most modest and unostentatious announcement of its kind in London. The grimy <b>ground-glass</b> displays the words: ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was another}} {{who read the}} account of the {{exercises}} with intense interest, a gentleman of whom we have lately forborne to speak. This is Mr. Eliphalet Hopper. Eliphalet has prospered. It is to be doubted if that somewhat easy-going gentleman, Colonel Carvel, realized the full importance of Eliphalet to Carvel & Company. Mr. Hood had been superseded. Ephum still opened the store in the mornings, but Mr. Hopper was within the <b>ground-glass</b> office before the place was warm, and through warerooms and shipping rooms, rubbing his hands, to see if any were late. Many of the old force were missed, and a new and greater force were come in. These feared Eliphalet as they did the devil, and worked the harder to please him, because Eliphalet had hired that kind. To them the Colonel was lifted high above the sordid affairs of the world. He was at the store every day in the winter, and Mr. Hopper always followed him obsequiously into the <b>ground-glass</b> office, called in the book-keeper, and showed him the books and the increased earnings.|$|E
60|$|It {{struck the}} back of the fur coat and fell on the floor behind her. She never looked round. She walked to the door, opened it without haste, and on the landing in the {{diffused}} light from the <b>ground-glass</b> skylight there appeared, rigid, like an implacable and obscure fate, the awful Therese—waiting for her sister. The heavy ends of a big black shawl thrown over her head hung massively in biblical folds. With a faint cry of dismay Doña Rita stopped just within my room.|$|E
6000|$|Stephen's chest heaved, and as {{he walked}} back to the office with the Judge, he could not trust himself to speak. Back to the silent office where the shelves mocked them. The Judge closed the <b>ground-glass</b> door behind him, and Stephen sat until five o'clock over a book. No, it was not Whittlesey, but Hardee's [...] "Tactics." [...] He shut it with a slam, and went to Verandah Hall to drill {{recruits}} on a dusty floor,--narrow-chested citizens in suspenders, who knew not the first motion in right about face. For Stephen was an adjutant in the Home Guards--what was left of them.|$|E
60|$|There {{was only}} one person who really bothered Eliphalet as he rose into prominence, and that person was Captain Elijah Brent. If, upon {{entering}} the <b>ground-glass</b> office, he found Eliphalet without the Colonel, Captain Lige would walk out again just as if the office were empty. The inquiries he made were addressed always to Ephum. Once, when Mr. Hopper had bidden him good morning and pushed a chair toward him, the honest Captain had turned his back and marched straight to the house or Tenth Street, where he found the Colonel alone at breakfast. The Captain sat down opposite.|$|E
60|$|Ruth, as {{has been}} stated, sat during her hours of work behind a <b>ground-glass</b> screen, unseen and unseeing. To her the patrons of the {{establishment}} were mere disembodied voices--wheedling voices, pathetic voices, voices that protested, voices that hectored, voices that whined, moaned, broke, appealed to the saints, and in various other ways endeavoured to instil into M. Gandinot more spacious and princely views on the subject advancing money on property pledged. She was sitting behind her screen this morning, scribbling idly on the blotting-pad, for {{there had been a}} lull in the business, when the door opened, and the polite, 'Bonjour, monsieur,' of M. Gandinot announced the arrival of another unfortunate.|$|E
60|$|The {{lights were}} out, but, groping {{his way up}} to the first landing, he took from a cup-boarded niche in the wall his {{candlestick}} and matches and continued the ascent to his room. The humble candlelight flickered on the ostentatious gold letters displayed on the <b>ground-glass</b> doors of opulent companies which he knew were famous, and rooms where millionaires met in secret conclave, but the contrast awakened only his sense of humor. Yet he was always relieved after he had reached his own floor. Possibly its incompleteness and inchoate condition made it seem less lonely than the desolation of the finished and furnished rooms below, and it was only this recollection of past human occupancy that was depressing.|$|E
6000|$|Despite the superlative snappiness of Mr. Silberfarb's dress-suits his {{establishment}} was a loft over a delicatessen, {{approached by}} a splintery stairway along which hung shabby signs announcing the upstairs offices of [...] "J. L. & T. J. O'Regan, Private Detectives," [...] "The Zenith Spiritualist Church, Messages by Rev. Lulu Paughouse," [...] "The International Order of Live Ones, Seattle Wigwam," [...] and [...] "Mme. Lavourie, Sulphur Baths." [...] The dead air of the hallway suggested petty crookedness. Milt felt {{that he ought to}} fight somebody but, there being no one to fight, he banged along the flapping boards of the second-floor hallway to the <b>ground-glass</b> door of Silberfarb the Society Tailor, who was also, as an afterthought on a straggly placard, [...] "Pressng & Cleang While U Wait." ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Harman {{had taken}} that grubby but {{convenient}} little instrument and hidden {{it in her}} muff, and she had gone straight out of Miss Alimony's flat to the Post Office {{at the corner of}} Jago Street, and there, with one simple effective impact, had smashed a <b>ground-glass</b> window, the property of His Majesty King George the Fifth. And having done so, she had called the attention of a youthful policeman, fresh from Yorkshire, to her offence, and after a slight struggle with his incredulity and a visit to the window in question, had escorted him to the South Hampsmith police-station, and had there made him charge her. And on the way she explained to him with a newfound lucidity why it was that women should have votes.|$|E
6000|$|He went next day, {{according}} to promise, {{to call at}} Cargill's office, which was {{on the fifth floor}} of a large six-story building on the main street. There were two ornamental <b>ground-glass</b> doors opening from the end of a narrow hall. One was marked, [...] "Bergen & Cargill, Commission Merchants, Private," [...] and Bradley entered. A man seated at a low table was operating a telegraphic machine. He was in his shirt sleeves, and wore blue checked over-sleeves, and carried a handkerchief under his chin to keep his collar from getting soiled. He sat near two desks which separated the private room from the larger room, in which were seated several men looking at one side of the wall, which was a blackboard checked off in small squares by red lines. Columns of figures in chalk were there displayed.|$|E
60|$|The clerks within {{were not}} a whit behind-hand in their demonstrations of respect. A solemn hush prevailed, as Mr Dombey passed through the outer office. The wit of the Counting-House became in a moment as mute as the row of leathern fire-buckets hanging up behind him. Such vapid and flat {{daylight}} as filtered through the <b>ground-glass</b> windows and skylights, leaving a black sediment upon the panes, showed the books and papers, and the figures bending over them, enveloped in a studious gloom, and as much abstracted in appearance, from the world without, {{as if they were}} assembled {{at the bottom of the}} sea; while a mouldy little strong room in the obscure perspective, where a shaded lamp was always burning, might have represented the cavern of some ocean monster, looking on with a red eye at these mysteries of the deep.|$|E
60|$|The clock struck five--briskly, as if {{time were}} money. Ruth Warden {{got up from}} her desk and, having put on her hat, emerged into the outer office where M. Gandinot {{received}} visitors. M. Gandinot, the ugliest man in Roville-sur-Mer, presided over the local mont-de-piete, and Ruth served him, from ten to five, {{as a sort of}} secretary-clerk. Her duties, if monotonous, were simple. They consisted of sitting, detached and invisible, behind a <b>ground-glass</b> screen, and entering details of loans in a fat book. She was kept busy as a rule, for Roville possesses two casinos, each offering the attraction of petits chevaux, and just round the corner is Monte Carlo. Very brisk was the business done by M. Gandinot, the pawnbroker, and very frequent were the pitying shakes of the head and clicks of the tongue of M. Gandinot, the man; for in his unofficial capacity Ruth's employer had a gentle soul, and winced at the evidences of tragedy which presented themselves before his official eyes.|$|E
60|$|At {{the offices}} in the City, the <b>ground-glass</b> windows are made more dim by shutters; and while the lighted lamps upon the desks are half {{extinguished}} by the day that wanders in, the day is half extinguished by the lamps, and an unusual gloom prevails. There is not much business done. The clerks are indisposed to work; and they make assignations to eat chops in the afternoon, and go up the river. Perch, the messenger, stays long upon his errands; and finds himself in bars of public-houses, invited thither by friends, and holding forth on the uncertainty of human affairs. He goes home to Ball's Pond {{earlier in the evening}} than usual, and treats Mrs Perch to a veal cutlet and Scotch ale. Mr Carker the Manager treats no one; neither is he treated; but alone in his own room he shows his teeth all day; and it would seem that there is something gone from Mr Carker's path--some obstacle removed--which clears his way before him.|$|E
60|$|Trafford {{surveyed}} the place; {{it seemed to}} him to have shrunken a little {{in the course of the}} three years that had intervened since he resigned his position. On the wall at the back there still hung, fly-blown and a little crumpled, an old table of constants he had made for his elasticity researches. Lake had kept it there, for Lake was a man of generous appreciations, and rather proud to follow in the footsteps of an investigator of Trafford's subtlety and vigor. The old sink in the corner where Trafford had once swilled his watch glasses and filled his beakers had been replaced by one of a more modern construction, and the combustion cupboard was unfamiliar, until Durgan pointed out that it had been enlarged. The <b>ground-glass</b> window at the east end showed still the marks of an explosion that had banished a clumsy student from this sanctuary at the very beginning of Trafford's career.|$|E
60|$|September 28th.--8---- and I {{walked to}} Charing Cross {{yesterday}} forenoon, and there took a Hansom cab to St. Paul's Cathedral. It {{had been a}} thick, foggy morning, but had warmed and brightened {{into one of the}} balmiest and sunniest of noons. As we entered the cathedral, the long bars of sunshine were falling from its upper windows through the great interior atmosphere, and were made visible by the dust, or mist, floating about in it. It is a grand edifice, and I liked it quite as much as on my first view of it, although a sense of coldness and nakedness is felt when we compare it with Gothic churches. It is more an external work than the Gothic churches are, and is not so made out of the dim, awful, mysterious, grotesque, intricate nature of man. But it is beautiful and grand. I love its remote distances, and wide, clear spaces, its airy massiveness; its noble arches, its sky-like dome, which, I think, should be all over light, with <b>ground-glass,</b> instead of being dark, with only diminutive windows.|$|E
60|$|The {{offices of}} the old-established firm of Marlowe, Thorpe, Prescott, Winslow and Appleby are in Ridgeway's Inn, not far from Fleet Street. If you are a millionaire beset by blackmailers or anyone else to whose comfort the best legal advice is essential, and have decided to put your affairs {{in the hands of}} the ablest and discreetest firm in London, you proceed through a dark and grimy entry and up a dark and grimy flight of stairs; and, having felt your way along a dark and grimy passage, you come at length to a dark and grimy door. There is plenty of dirt in other parts of Ridgeway's Inn, but nowhere is it so plentiful, so rich in {{alluvial}} deposits, as on the exterior of the offices of Marlowe, Thorpe, Prescott, Winslow and Appleby. As you tap on the topmost of the geological strata concealing the <b>ground-glass</b> of the door, a sense of relief and security floods your being. For in London grubbiness is the gauge of a lawyer's respectability.|$|E
6000|$|She {{followed}} Oxford Street into Holborn, {{and then}} she inquired for Chancery Lane. There she sought and at last found 107A, one of those heterogeneous piles of offices which occupy {{the eastern side of}} the lane. She studied the painted names of firms and persons and enterprises on the wall, and discovered that the Women's Bond of Freedom occupied several contiguous suites on the first floor. She went up-stairs and hesitated between four doors with <b>ground-glass</b> panes, each of which professed [...] "The Women's Bond of Freedom" [...] in neat black letters. She opened one and found herself in a large untidy room set with chairs that were a little disarranged as if by an overnight meeting. On the walls were notice-boards bearing clusters of newspaper slips, three or four big posters of monster meetings, one of which Ann Veronica had attended with Miss Miniver, and a series of announcements in purple copying-ink, and in one corner was a pile of banners. There was no one at all in this room, but through the half-open door of one of the small apartments that gave upon it she had a glimpse of two very young girls sitting at a littered table and writing briskly.|$|E
60|$|The sanctum of Mr. John Girdlestone was {{approached}} by two doors, one of oak with <b>ground-glass</b> panels, and the other covered with green baize. The room itself was small, but lofty, and the walls were ornamented by numerous sections of ships stuck upon long flat boards, very much as the remains of fossil fish are exhibited in museums, together with maps, charts, photographs, and lists of sailings innumerable. Above the fire-place was a large water-colour painting of the barque Belinda as she appeared when on a reef {{to the north of}} Cape Palmas. An inscription beneath this work of art announced that it had been painted by the second officer and presented by him {{to the head of the}} firm. It was generally rumoured that the merchants had lost heavily over this disaster, and there were some who quoted it as an instance of Girdlestone's habitual strength of mind that he should decorate his wall with so melancholy a souvenir. This view of the matter did not appear to commend itself to a flippant member of Lloyd's agency, who contrived to intimate, by a dexterous use of his left eyelid and right forefinger, that the vessel may not have been so much under-insured, nor the loss to the firm so enormous as was commonly reported.|$|E
60|$|A narrow {{entrance}} was flanked {{on either side}} by a row of brasses, ranging upwards from the shipbrokers and the solicitors who occupied the ground floors, through a long succession of West Indian agents, architects, surveyors, and brokers, to the firm of which they were in quest. A winding stone stair, well carpeted and railed at first but growing shabbier with every landing, brought them past innumerable doors until, at last, just under the <b>ground-glass</b> roofing, the names of Smith and Hanbury were to be seen painted in large white letters across a panel, with a laconic invitation to push beneath it. Following out the suggestion, the Admiral and his companion {{found themselves in a}} dingy apartment, ill lit from a couple of glazed windows. An ink-stained table, littered with pens, papers, and almanacs, an American cloth sofa, three chairs of varying patterns, and a much-worn carpet, constituted all the furniture, save only a very large and obtrusive porcelain spittoon, and a gaudily framed and very somber picture which hung above the fireplace. Sitting in front of this picture, and staring gloomily at it, as being the only thing which he could stare at, was a small sallow-faced boy with a large head, who in the intervals of his art studies munched sedately at an apple.|$|E
60|$|Glare is {{a leading}} error in the {{philosophy}} of American household decoration--an error easily recognised as deduced from the perversion of taste just specified., We are violently enamoured of gas and of glass. The former is totally inadmissible within doors. Its harsh and unsteady light offends. No one having both brains and eyes will use it. A mild, or what artists term a cool light, with its consequent warm shadows, will do wonders for even an ill-furnished apartment. Never was a more lovely thought than that of the astral lamp. We mean, of course, the astral lamp proper--the lamp of Argand, with its original plain <b>ground-glass</b> shade, and its tempered and uniform moonlight rays. The cut-glass shade is a weak invention of the enemy. The eagerness with which we have adopted it, partly on account of its flashiness, but principally on account of its greater rest, is a good commentary on the proposition with which we began. It is not too much to say, that the deliberate employer of a cut-glass shade, is either radically deficient in taste, or blindly subservient to the caprices of fashion. The light proceeding from one of these gaudy abominations is unequal broken, and painful. It alone is sufficient to mar a world of good effect in the furniture subjected to its influence. Female loveliness, in especial, is more than one-half disenchanted beneath its evil eye.|$|E
6000|$|... "A lamp, burning under a {{shade of}} <b>ground-glass,</b> showed a {{handsome}} apartment, wainscoted with oak; supper was {{laid on the}} table; by the fire-place, standing as if waiting our entrance, appeared a lady; she was young, tall, and well shaped; her dress was handsome and fashionable: so much my first glance sufficed to ascertain. A gay salutation passed between her and Mr. Crimsworth; she chid him, half playfully, half poutingly, for being late; her voice (I always take voices into the account in judging of character) was lively--it indicated, I thought, good animal spirits. Mr. Crimsworth soon checked her animated scolding with a kiss--a kiss that still told of the bridegroom (they {{had not yet been}} married a year); she took her seat at the supper-table in first-rate spirits. Perceiving me, she begged my pardon for not noticing me before, and then shook hands with me, as ladies do when a flow of good-humour disposes them to be cheerful to all, even the most indifferent of their acquaintance. It was now further obvious to me that she had a good complexion, and features sufficiently marked but agreeable; her hair was red--quite red. She and Edward talked much, always in a vein of playful contention; she was vexed, or pretended to be vexed, that he had that day driven a vicious horse in the gig, and he made light of her fears. Sometimes she appealed to me.|$|E
