5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII, Vanille was {{originally}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> main character, {{but after the}} game was shown off with Lightning in the central role, the decision was scrapped. In an interview with Siliconera, Vanille's English voice actor stated that she found it relatively easy connecting with the character because of the similarities in their basic personalities. Vanille is voiced by Georgia van Cuylenburg in English, and by Yukari Fukui in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} {{differences}} in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. One feature continued from season one {{was the way the}} show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives you an idea of who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will happen next.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, it was {{reported}} that only 20% of the game was complete. Numerous features {{were not included in the}} final product due to time and budget constraints. The developers originally planned to add a special weapon designed to be used underwater and acquired from Chris at the end of the eight episode, but the plot of the game changed during development and the team had to discard it. Additionally, the land in the distance that can be seen from the ship in the first episode was originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> setting of the last episode, where Jill would have found something from her past.|$|E

5|$|The idea of Crisis Core {{originated}} when Hajime Tabata {{was chosen}} as director for an upcoming Final Fantasy title for the PlayStation Portable. After discussion with Tetsuya Nomura and Yoshinori Kitase, Tabata decided that the game should be another installment in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, feeling that the pressure of producing a game from a popular series would motivate both the staff and himself. The original idea {{was to make a}} PlayStation Portable port of Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII, as it had been released for mobile-phones and the staff wanted to expand it. However, after deciding Zack was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> protagonist of the new game, the idea of a Before Crisis port was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, MacArthur had {{attacked}} the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous {{picture of his}} first meeting with the Emperor, whose impact on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw the Emperor as a mere man overshadowed by the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, the Emperor had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were always taken from a certain angle to make him look taller and more impressive than he really was. No Japanese photographer would have taken such a photo of the Emperor being overshadowed by MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned the photo of the Emperor with MacArthur {{on the grounds that it}} damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it. The photo was intended as a message to the Emperor about who was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> senior partner in their relationship.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his scenes, Rupert Graves was tanned {{because before}} filming the episode, the actor was in Guadeloupe, an island on the Caribbean, {{appearing}} in Death in Paradise. As a result, Gatiss added mention that Lestrade went on holiday in the script. In the original episode, John was to hallucinate the hound at a meat storage locker. However, after visiting such a locker in Bristol, the producers came to realise {{that it would}} be too expensive, and cold for Freeman, forcing them to change the setting to the Baskerville labs. In one scene, Sherlock is driving a Land Rover with John as a passenger after their arrival at Dartmoor; John was originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> one driving the car, however Freeman cannot drive. In the client scenes, Tovey had to smoke a herbal cigarette as it was illegal to smoke real cigarettes on set. Throughout the episode, the production crew used split dioptres in certain scenes, a camera technique where two separate camera angles are at the same focus on screen. The episode also includes shots of the hound, which was produced by visual effects. Although the series used computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the past, {{it was the first time}} a visual effect was made on a large scale. However, there was no guide for the cast to interact with.|$|E

25|$|By 1915, {{with the}} prompt seizure of Germany's pacific possessions, it was {{becoming}} apparent {{that there would be}} very little for the Royal Australian Naval Brigade to do beyond securing Australia's ports. It was also becoming obvious that Trench Warfare was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> main feature of the Western Front, and that engineering units were in strong demand. Reports reached Australia that the even a Naval contingent would be acceptable, as the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division, consisting of Royal Marines and Naval Reservists, was preparing to join the Western Front.|$|E
25|$|The Arab Ba'ath Movement, led by Aflaq and al-Bitar, was {{merged into}} the Arab Ba'ath Party in 1947. During {{negotiations}} Wahib al-Ghanim and Jalal al-Sayyid, not al-Arsuzi, represented the Arab Ba'ath, while Aflaq and al-Bitar represented the Arab Ba'ath Movement. The only policy issue which was discussed {{in great detail}} was how socialist the party was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>The</b> groups came to an agreement; the Ba'ath movement became radicalised, and moved further to the left. Al-Arsuzi {{did not attend the}} founding congress, nor was he given membership in the new party.|$|E

25|$|The final {{story to}} be {{produced}} {{as part of the}} original run was Ghost Light, although it was not the last to be broadcast. That was Survival, the last episode of which was transmitted on 6 December 1989, and brought the series' twenty-six year run to a close. John Nathan-Turner decided close to transmission that a more suitable conclusion should be given to the final episode as it was possibly <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last ever. Accordingly, Andrew Cartmel wrote a short, melancholic closing monologue for Sylvester McCoy, which McCoy recorded on 23 November 1989 – by coincidence, the show's twenty-sixth anniversary. This was dubbed over the closing scene as the Doctor and his companion Ace walked off into the distance, apparently to further adventures.|$|E
25|$|For a while 1914 {{looked like}} it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first ever {{relatively}} calm year for Merezhkovsky. With the two Complete Works Of editions released by the Wolfe's and Sytin's publishing houses, academic Nestor Kotlyarevsky nominated the author for the Nobel Prize for literature. Then World War I broke out. Merezhkovskys expressed their skepticism as to the Russian involvement in it and the patriotic hullabaloo stirred up by some intellectuals. The writer made a conscious effort to distance himself from politics and succeeded almost, but in 1915 was in it again, becoming friends with Alexander Kerensky and joining the Maxim Gorky-led Movement of the patriotic left calling for Russia's withdrawal from the War in the painless possible way.|$|E
25|$|Amon's {{first year}} with Ferrari {{did not begin}} auspiciously. En route to Brands Hatch for the {{pre-season}} Formula One Race of Champions, he crashed his road car and, following race practice, had to withdraw. Tragedy then struck the Ferrari team when Bandini died following a crash during the 1967 Monaco Grand Prix, Mike Parkes broke both his legs at the Belgian Grand Prix and, in the aftermath, Ludovico Scarfiotti went into temporary retirement. Amon, therefore, became Ferrari's only driver {{for the rest of}} the season, until joined by Jonathan Williams for the final race in Mexico. Amon scored his first podium in his first official outing for the Scuderia in Monaco and at the end of 1967 had achieved four third places finishing fifth in the Drivers' Championship, in what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most successful season of his career.|$|E
