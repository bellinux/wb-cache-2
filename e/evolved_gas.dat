25|$|The Thermal and <b>Evolved</b> <b>Gas</b> Analyzer (TEGA) is a {{combination}} of a high-temperature furnace with a mass spectrometer. It was used to bake samples of Martian dust and determine its content. It has eight ovens, each {{about the size of a}} large ball-point pen, which were able to analyze one sample each, for a total of eight separate samples. Team members measured how much water vapor and carbon dioxide gas were given off, how much water ice the samples contained, and what minerals are present that may have formed during a wetter, warmer past climate. The instrument also measured organic volatiles, such as methane, down to 10 ppb. TEGA was built by the University of Arizona and University of Texas at Dallas.|$|E
25|$|As a {{standard}} method for analysis, mass spectrometers have reached other planets and moons. Two {{were taken to}} Mars by the Viking program. In early 2005 the Cassini–Huygens mission delivered a specialized GC-MS instrument aboard the Huygens probe through the atmosphere of Titan, the largest moon of the planet Saturn. This instrument analyzed atmospheric samples along its descent trajectory {{and was able to}} vaporize and analyze samples of Titan's frozen, hydrocarbon covered surface once the probe had landed. These measurements compare the abundance of isotope(s) of each particle comparatively to earth's natural abundance. Also on board the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft was an ion and neutral mass spectrometer which had been taking measurements of Titan's atmospheric composition as well as the composition of Enceladus' plumes. A Thermal and <b>Evolved</b> <b>Gas</b> Analyzer mass spectrometer was carried by the Mars Phoenix Lander launched in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Space science {{research}} has been {{a hallmark of the}} university since its inception in 1964. The William B. Hanson Center for Space Studies (CSS), affiliated with the Department of Physics, conducts research in space plasma physics. It {{has its roots in the}} Earth and Planetary Sciences Laboratory of the university's predecessor. The center also conducts a NASA-sponsored mission, Coupled Ion-Neutral Dynamics Investigation (CINDI), which was launched in April 2008 in cooperation with the United States Air Force. CINDI, which is part of the payload for the Communication and Navigation Outage Forecast System program, seeks to uncover information about the equatorial plasma bubbles that interrupt radio signals. Furthermore, under the leadership of John H. Hoffman, the center designed the mass spectrometer for the Phoenix Mars Lander as part of the Thermal and <b>Evolved</b> <b>Gas</b> Analyzer (TEGA) experiment in cooperation with the University of Arizona.|$|E

40|$|The design, the {{abilities}} and a characteristic application of an in-house made interface for combining thermogravimetry (TG) with mass spectrometry (MS) are presented. The TG-MS interface consists mainly of three co-axial tubes. The {{position of the}} intermediate tube was determined after calculation of the temperature profile at the TG furnace exit tube. The inner tube position was determined taking into consideration its protection against condensation of heavy molecules and the time delay for {{the transfer of the}} <b>evolved</b> <b>gases.</b> This interface allows either continuous sampling and transferring of the <b>evolved</b> <b>gases</b> from the TG to the MS or repetitive introduction of short sampling pulses of TG <b>evolved</b> <b>gases</b> to MS.

Finally an example of application of this interface on forest fuel pyrolysis is presented...|$|R
40|$|An accurate, versatile, and {{sensitive}} method for {{the determination of}} hydrogen in milligram-size titanium samples is presented. It involves extraction of hydrogen at 1070 K while a mercury diffusion pump transfers the <b>evolved</b> <b>gases</b> into the inlet of a mass spectrometer. All the <b>evolved</b> <b>gases</b> may then be positively identified and determined. This method can be readily adapted for use with other metals and {{for the study of}} the slow evolution of hydrogen. Reduction of interferences due to the evolution of hydrogen by reactions involving vapors such as those of water, acetone, and vacuum grease is discussed...|$|R

6000|$|... 991. To prove this, I {{arranged}} ten {{pairs of}} amalgamated zinc and platina plates with dilute sulphuric acid {{in the form}} of a battery. On completing the circuit, all the pairs acted and <b>evolved</b> <b>gas</b> at the surfaces of the platina. This was collected and found to be alike in quantity for each plate; and the quantity of hydrogen evolved at any one platina plate was in the same proportion to the quantity of metal dissolved from any one zinc plate, as was given in the experiment with a single pair (864. &c.). It was therefore certain, that, just as much electricity and no more had passed through the series of ten pair of plates as had passed through, or would have been put into motion by, any single pair, notwithstanding that ten times the quantity of zinc had been consumed.|$|E
60|$|And I am now {{putting a}} few {{little pieces of}} zinc into it. This little {{instrument}} I am going to apply to a useful purpose in our demonstrations--for I want to shew you that you can prepare hydrogen, and make some experiments with it as you please at your own homes. Let me here tell you why I am so careful to fill this phial nearly, and yet not quite full. I do it because the <b>evolved</b> <b>gas,</b> which, as you have seen, is very combustible, is explosive to a considerable extent when mixed with air, and might lead to harm, {{if you were to}} apply a light to the end of that pipe before all the air had been swept out of the space above the water. I am now about to pour in the sulphuric acid. I have used very little zinc, and more sulphuric acid and water, because I want to keep it at work for some time. I therefore take care in this way to modify the proportions of the ingredients, so that I may have a regular supply--not too quick, and not too slow. Supposing I now take a glass and put it upside-down over the end of the tube, because the hydrogen is light I expect that it will remain in that vessel a little while. We will now test the contents of our glass to see if there be hydrogen in it. I think I am safe in saying we have caught some [applying a light]. There it is, you see. I will now apply a light {{to the top of the}} tube. There is the hydrogen burning. There is our philosophical candle. It is a foolish feeble sort of a flame, you may say; but it is so hot that scarcely any common flame gives out so much heat. It goes on burning regularly, and I am now about to put that flame to burn under a certain arrangement, in order that we may examine its results and make use of the information which we may thereby acquire. Inasmuch as the candle produces water, and this gas comes out of the water, let us see what this gives us by the same process of combustion that the candle went through when it burnt in the atmosphere; and for that purpose I am going to put the lamp under this apparatus, in order to condense whatever may arise from the combustion within it In the course of a short time you will see moisture appearing in the cylinder, and you will get the water running down the side; and the water from this hydrogen flame will have absolutely the same effect upon all our tests, being obtained by the same general process as in the former case. This hydrogen is a very beautiful substance. It is so light that it carries things up: it is far lighter than the atmosphere; and I dare say I can shew you this by an experiment which, if you are very clever, some of you may even have skill enough to repeat. Here is our generator of hydrogen, and here are some soap-suds. I have an india-rubber tube connected with the hydrogen generator, and at the end of the tube is a tobacco-pipe.|$|E

50|$|Thermate {{composition}} is a thermite one enriched with a salt-based oxidizer (usually nitrates, e.g. barium nitrate, or peroxides). In contrast with thermites, thermates burn with evolution of flame and gases. The {{presence of the}} oxidizer makes the mixture easier to ignite and improves penetration of target by the burning composition, as the <b>evolved</b> <b>gas</b> is projecting the molten slag and providing mechanical agitation.

50|$|For {{achieving}} a vacuum-tight seal, the seal must not contain bubbles.
