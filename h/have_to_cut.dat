5|$|When Obsidian were {{preparing}} to present Knights of the Old Republic II at E3 2004, they tried to fit {{as much information as}} they could, saying that it would need to be a duration of 30 minutes as it was the only E3 event it would be showcased at; however, due to the limited time frame, they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> it down to a five- to ten-minute presentation. During this time, none of the levels Obsidian designed were ready to be shown, so they picked three levels, and put them through a schedule to finish them on time. The demo was finished {{a few days before the}} event, and the game was presented in May 2004. The first trailer for Knights of the Old Republic II was later unveiled in July 2004, and the official website was launched in October.|$|E
5|$|As they {{sail for}} Greenland, strange things begin {{to happen to}} the ships bearing the {{tourmaline}} veils. Marine life and sea birds of all kinds are attracted towards them, and crew stationed aboard them for too long begin acting intoxicated and amorous. The plant and animal life attracted to the ships experiences rapid growth, so that before they reach Greenland the ships look more like mountains or meadows than ships. Strange sea creatures never before seen appear around the ships, and when the expedition is ready to deploy the tourmaline veils, they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> through the riot of organic growth that has totally filled the ships. Once the energy of the veils is unleashed on Greenland, it melts the ice quickly but also has unanticipated effects. Prehistoric bones and plant remains that were buried under the ice are reanimated, and fuse together into monstrous forms made up of plant, animal, and mineral parts. Greenland, free of its icy burden, rises up, ripping from north to south in the process and becoming two separate islands. As the chapter ends, the now enormous monsters brought to life by the volcanic energy are spilling away from Greenland towards Europe.|$|E
25|$|U.S. {{healthcare}} costs are considerably higher than other countries {{as a share}} of GDP, among other measures. According to the OECD, U.S. {{healthcare costs}} in 2015 were 16.9% GDP, over 5% GDP higher than the next most expensive OECD country. A gap of 5% GDP represents $1 trillion, about $3,000 per person relative to the next most expensive country. In other words, the U.S. would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> healthcare costs by roughly one-third ($1 trillion or $3,000 per person on average) to be competitive with the next most expensive country.|$|E

25|$|U.S. {{healthcare}} costs in 2015 were 16.9% GDP {{according to the}} OECD, over 5% GDP higher than the next most expensive OECD country. With U.S. GDP of $19 trillion, {{healthcare costs}} were about $3.2 trillion, or about $10,000 per person {{in a country of}} 320 million people. A gap of 5% GDP represents $1 trillion, about $3,000 per person relative to the next most expensive country. In other words, the U.S. would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> healthcare costs by roughly one-third to be competitive with the next most expensive country.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year Dickens would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> a provincial tour short after collapsing showing {{symptoms of a}} mild stroke in Preston on 22 April 1869. When he had regained sufficient strength, he arranged, with medical approval, {{for a series of}} readings to partially make up to Chappell & Co. what they had lost due of his illness. There were to be twelve final performances, running starting on 11 January 1870 back at the hall. Dickens would give his last public reading here at 8:00 pm on the 15 March 1870. He died shortly thereafter on 9 June, having suffered another stroke.|$|E
25|$|Rumors {{and demands}} for a remake of VII existed for many years, but {{multiple}} reasons were given for why the project was not being developed. Three key original staff members returned to help with Remake: original character designer Tetsuya Nomura returned to both direct and handle character redesigns, original director Yoshinori Kitase acted as producer, while Kazushige Nojima returned to write the script. The decision to release Remake in multiple parts was taken so the team did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> any of the original content. They also decided to add new content, and adjusted the original character designs to balance between realism and stylization.|$|E

25|$|The global {{chemicals}} {{industry was}} in a distinct recession, and the company faced difficult times. The company employed 23,000 and had £2 billion in annual revenue, with 30% from the United States, 40% from Europe and 15% from Asia-Pacific. CEO Sipko Huismans had focused the company on rationalisation and cost cutting: We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> costs. We can't count on sales growth to pay us more or {{to allow us to}} buy more of our favorite things. In 1991, the company closed its viscose plant in Calais, France, allowing its other plants to boost output to 93% capacity, compared with an industry average of 75%. This enabled the share price to double in the first three years following the demerger.|$|E
25|$|While {{scheduled}} to tour with Tedashii and KB, Sims was contacted by Shawna Peezy, the manager for Iggy Azalea, requesting that she fly to Wales {{in order to}} help Azalea write The New Classic (2014). Sims was initially hesitant to take the offer, as she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> her tour short, and felt uncomfortable with the risqué content put out by Azalea. However, she then received a call from Sarah Stennett from the London-based management team Turn First Artists. Stennett explained that her company was trying to commercialize Azalea's image. Sims understood this to mean a less provocative and explicit approach, and, hoping to be a more positive influence on Azalea's content, abandoned the last four stops on her tour and flew over to Wales in December.|$|E

Healthcare spending in the U.S. was distributed as follows in 2014: Hospital care 32%; physician and clinical services 20%; prescription drugs 10%; and all other, including many categories individually making up less than 5% of spending. These first three categories accounted for 62% of spending.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{argue that}} Fairtrade harms all non-Fairtrade farmers. Fairtrade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on {{increasing}} yields and quality. Economists state that, {{if this is}} indeed so, Fairtrade farmers will increase production. As the demand for coffee is highly elastic, a small increase in supply means a large fall in market price, so perhaps a million Fairtrade farmers get a higher price and 24 million others get a substantially lower price. Critics quote the example of farmers in Vietnam being paid over the world price in the 1980s, planting lots of coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s. The Fairtrade minimum price means that when the world market price collapses, it is the non-Fairtrade farmers, particularly the poorest, who <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> down their coffee trees. This argument is supported by mainstream economists, not just free marketers.|$|E
500|$|... "Grief Counseling" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} Jennifer Celotta, and was directed by Roger Nygard, his only episode of The Office to date. In a later interview with Den of Geek, Nygard found that [...] "television episodes are {{the domain of the}} writer-producers. You are there to service their vision. The Office is fully scripted, but there's always a little room to play when it's warranted. The first cuts are around 45 minutes, so you often <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the episodes in half for air." [...] Though [...] "Grief Counseling" [...] broadcast before the fifth episode, [...] "Initiation", its filming took place after that episode due to the availability of shooting on Dwight's fictional beet farm.|$|E
500|$|Lewis Hamilton {{was criticized}} for his {{aggressive}} drive into the first corner by much of the British press. Edward Gorman of The Times described Hamilton's move as [...] "impetuosity and untamed aggression", adding that Hamilton [...] "gambled with a kamikaze attempt to get past Räikkönen". The BBC's Andrew Benson said that [...] "Hamilton is still in a strong position but the Englishman will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> out the mistakes that have characterised his season {{if he is not}} to lose the championship {{for the second year in}} a row." [...] In Italy, La Gazzetta dello Sport said that Hamilton's start suffered from [...] "his usual excessive aggression". Hamilton said [...] "I made a mistake and I paid for it." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Cindy Williams {{was cast}} as Laurie Henderson, the actress {{hoped she would}} get the part of Debbie Dunham, which ended up going to Candy Clark. Mackenzie Phillips, who portrays Carol, was only 12 years old, and under California law, {{producer}} Gary Kurtz had to become her legal guardian {{for the duration of}} filming. For Bob Falfa, Roos cast Harrison Ford, who was then concentrating on a carpentry career. Ford agreed to take the role on the condition that he would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> his hair. The character has a flattop in the script, but a compromise was eventually reached whereby Ford wore a stetson to cover his hair. Producer Francis Ford Coppola encouraged Lucas to cast Wolfman Jack as himself in a cameo appearance. [...] "George Lucas and I went through thousands of Wolfman Jack phone calls that were taped with the public," [...] Jack reflected. [...] "The telephone calls [...] in the motion picture and on the soundtrack were actual calls with real people." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{supposed}} to be released in late 2007, but Carey spoke about reason the album got delayed: [...] "You can't really put records out in December if you want the whole world {{to have a chance to}} actually hear it, [...] my fans all over the world are very important to me", adding that she also wants to put out a pair of singles before the album drops. In a separate interview, she elaborated further: [...] "This happened to me with The Emancipation of Mimi, I started writing more songs, I was like okay let me get these done, then I wrote four more songs and you know how it goes, so now I'm like 22 songs in and clearly I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> some of those down". It was then reported that the album will be released in February 2008. However, the release was later pushed back yet again to April 2008.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the items}} {{passed in the}} {{legislative}} session were a bill allowing optometrists to perform eye surgery (a procedure usually reserved for ophthalmologists), {{a ban on the}} sale of a psychoactive drug marketed as [...] "bath salts", and a measure allowing community supervision and addiction treatment as jail alternatives for non-violent drug criminals. Measures that did not pass included tougher measures to curb illegal immigration advocated by Williams and raising the legal age for dropping out of high school from sixteen to eighteen, a proposal supported by Beshear. Also, the Assembly was unable to agree on whether to adopt Beshear's plan to address a shortfall in the state's Medicaid obligations or an alternative plan proposed by Williams. Beshear's plan involved moving $166 million from the second year of the biennial budget to cover the shortfall and cover the costs in the second year through savings achieved by switching to a managed care plan for Medicaid. Williams' plan, passed by the Republican majority in the state senate, called for $101 million in cuts to state government spending to cover the shortfall. Without a plan in place, Beshear estimated that the state would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> Medicaid reimbursements to health care providers by 30 percent.|$|E

500|$|Davies' {{scriptwriting}} {{was affected}} {{by the development of}} a head cold and overrunning script constraints; he was annoyed that he had written [...] "dialogue [...] been dying to write" [...] with a [...] "faint heart" [...] because he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> it. Because he was behind schedule, he was forced to cancel plans to attend Piper's wedding and almost cancelled plans to celebrate the New Year with his boyfriend. These problems affected his first draft of the Doctor's conversation with his companions and encounter with Davros; he dismissed it as [...] "lame shit" [...] which would waste licence-payers' money, and replaced it with a different version hours later. The conversation features all of the Doctor's companions simultaneously talking to the Doctor; Tate, Tennant, and director Graeme Harper made the creative decision to have the Doctor ignore any mention of the Daleks because they thought the Doctor's joviality in the scene would be otherwise inappropriate. He eventually finished the script at 1am on New Year's Eve. Cook reviewed the last pages of the script and suggested that the episode should air without a trailer; Davies agreed by noting that [...] " [...] never send out preview discs of the last episode" [...] and that any advertisements for [...] "Journey's End" [...] could [...] "just show lots of Daleks and a repeat of [...] "I'm regenerating" [...] The episode was officially submitted on : the preparation date for [...] "The Stolen Earth" [...] and [...] "Journey's End".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Dan Povenmire, while Peter Shin contributed as supervising director. Various scenes in [...] "PTV" [...] were {{taken out of the}} episode due to Fox's international censors. As the writers worked on the episode the producers ended up, as the Chicago Tribune describes it, [...] "horse trading" [...] with Fox, removing a body-part reference in exchange for a dirty word. While the writing staff of the show was disappointed with the number of scenes that were removed from the episode, they were happy with the final result. The opening sequence, of which Family Guys creator Seth MacFarlane was particularly proud, was added into the episode after the producers discovered the episode ran three minutes short. The episode contained a montage which showcased the most bawdy moments of the previous seasons; Povenmire recalled the sequence; about it he stated that [...] "I just found those off the DVD and digitized them and edited them in. Basically because I didn't want to draw all those things! I found the most disgusting images from the first three seasons. And we actually got network notes on two of them saying, 'You're gonna <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> that!' And I went, 'This has been on the air! And I'm only showing 8 frames of it!' And it turns out we cut them now when they're on the air. So apropos for the FCC episode." ...|$|E
