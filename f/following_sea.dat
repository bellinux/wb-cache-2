Her keel was laid down on 10 July 1884. After over four years of construction, she was {{launched}} on 17 October 1888. <b>Following</b> <b>sea</b> trials, the battleship was formally commissioned into the Regia Marina on 16 February 1893.|$|E

Six months later, she rejoined the active fleet and, on 7 June 1902, sailed north. She arrived at the Torpedo Station, Newport, R.I., on 18 July 1902; served briefly with the North Atlantic Squadron; then returned to Norfolk where she was decommissioned on 29 November.|$|E
25|$|In September 1871, she sailed from Havre to Tyneside in Northern England {{where she}} was {{lengthened}} to 421.7ft by A. Leslie and Company, Hebburn-on-Tyne and her tonnage increased to 5,065 tons. She was also fitted with compound steam engines and rebuilt with single screw propulsion, and the paddle wheels were removed. A third mast was also fitted and after completion of the works she was renamed Ville du Havre. <b>Following</b> <b>sea</b> trials, she recommenced her Havre – Brest – New York service in early 1873.|$|E

25|$|The {{first two}} lighthouses in Lowestoft {{were built in}} 1609 on the {{foreshore}} and candlelit, to give warning of the dangerous sandbanks around the coast. These were the first lighthouses constructed by Trinity House. The Low Light was discontinued in 1706 <b>following</b> <b>sea</b> encroachment, but re-established in 1730 {{in a form that}} could be easily moved in response to further changes to the Stamford Channel and shoreline. It was finally discontinued in August 1923. The High Light tower was rebuilt as the present lighthouse in 1874 with the intention of displaying an electric light, but when opened paraffin oil was used instead; it was not until 1936 that it was electrified. The lighthouse, along with two cottages originally used by lighthouse keepers, is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
500|$|To {{minimise}} their draught the Beacons {{were given}} a very full hull shape with squared-off bilges and a flat bottom. Admiral G. A. Ballard commented that they were built [...] "along the lines of an extremely elongated packing crate." [...] This made them steady gun platforms and gave them {{quite a bit of}} buoyancy. If they ran aground, this shape allowed them to be pulled off easily and they remained upright if stranded by a receding tide. However, this hull shape made their steering erratic at low speeds or in a <b>following</b> <b>sea</b> and they made a large amount of leeway in a strong side breeze.|$|E
500|$|Her hull {{was divided}} into nine {{compartments}} and she was fitted with five internal trim tanks, an internal central ballast tank and three external ballast tanks. She had a test depth of [...] Mariotte had two rudders, one above the waterline for submerged use and the other below the waterline for regular use. She had two sets of diving planes, fore and aft, to control her depth below the water. The boat was evaluated in 1914 and the commission {{felt that she was}} generally successful except for her surface speed and range. It noted that she had problems with a <b>following</b> <b>sea</b> as the superstructure rapidly filled with water, but drained slowly so that she was much heavier by the bow and would tend to wallow. It also felt that she was insufficiently buoyant and had mediocre stability on the surface.|$|E

50|$|When {{paddling}} in <b>following</b> <b>seas</b> in {{open ocean}} swell, {{it is possible}} to surf a kayak, thereby increasing one's speed. Ocean swell, having a longer distance between crests than wind waves, allows sea kayaks and other longer boats to surf down the front of the wave. This technique, especially when used on extended expedition trips, can add miles to a day trip.|$|R
5000|$|More succinctly, a broach is [...] "to slew {{around on}} a wave front." [...] Another source says it is [...] "extremely dangerous" [...] and likens it to turning {{broadside}} and losing control in <b>following</b> <b>seas,</b> so as to present the ship's side to oncoming large waves. In that event, the ship may [...] "trip" [...] on its keel, roll, capsize and turn turtle.|$|R
500|$|Asahi, meaning [...] "rising sun", {{a poetic}} name for Japan from a stanza of waka poetry, was laid down on 1 August 1898 in Clydebank, Scotland, by the Clydebank Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. and {{completed}} by John Brown & Company, which purchased the firm before Asahi was completed. She was launched on 13 March 1899 and completed on 31 July 1900. Her completion was delayed by {{about three months}} when her bottom plating required repairs after running aground off Southsea <b>following</b> <b>sea</b> trials. The ship departed England, after repairs in Portsmouth, {{on the day of}} her completion, and arrived at Yokosuka, Japan, on 23 October 1900. Asahi became flagship of the Standing Fleet on 22 May 1901 and was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet when the Combined Fleet was re-formed on 28 December 1903.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{lifeboats}} and cutters {{were built}} by Harland and Wolff at Queen's Island, Belfast {{at the same}} time that Titanic and her sister ship [...] were constructed. They were designed for maximum seaworthiness, with a double-ended design (effectively having two bows). This reduced the risk that they would be flooded by a <b>following</b> <b>sea</b> (i.e. having waves breaking over the stern). If a lifeboat had to be beached, the design would also resist the incoming surf. Another safety feature consisted of airtight copper tanks within the boats' sides to provide extra buoyancy.|$|E

The pick-ups also served aboard HMS Albion.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} known dories were beach dories {{developed for}} beach-launched fishing operations. The principal {{example is the}} Swampscott dory, named after Swampscott, Massachusetts where they were introduced. Early wherry types were modified with flat bottoms and borrowed construction techniques found in the French bateaus. [...] This resulted in an almost-round-sided boat with a narrow flat bottom, well suited to launching through the surf and able to hold up against aggressive ocean conditions. The narrow [...] "tombstone" [...] transom assured that the boat rode well against a <b>following</b> <b>sea</b> or breaking surf, and also made the boat easy to row.|$|E
2500|$|The hull {{shape of}} the Frolics was {{identical}} to that of their predecessors {{and they had a}} very full hull shape with squared-off bilges and a flat bottom. Admiral G. A.

She was expected to arrive in Falmouth in spring 2016 to allow A Group to fit military equipment such as communications gear. <b>Following</b> <b>sea</b> trials, Tidespring was to enter service {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2016, with her three sister ships following at six-month intervals. In August 2016 it was reported that RFA Tidespring was still undergoing trials with builder Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering (DSME) in South Korea; procurement minister Harriett Baldwin has blamed [...] "delays in finalising elements of electrical design and the installation of Multi-Cable Transit insulation in accordance with new legislative regulations" [...] which have now been resolved. Tidespring reached the UK in spring 2017, docking at Falmouth on 2 April for seventeen weeks to fit weapons and communications gear. Four months of acceptance trials will follow; her sisters will enter service by the end of 2018.|$|E
