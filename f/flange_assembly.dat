5000|$|In June 2001 the Nordic Empress {{suffered}} extensive {{engine room}} fire damage while sailing 140 {{miles north of}} Bermuda. Subsequent investigation revealed {{the cause of the}} fire was failure of a loose bolt in a fuel line <b>flange</b> <b>assembly</b> that had been improperly repaired. The broken bolt caused the <b>flange</b> <b>assembly</b> to separate, allowing fuel to leak around the engine. Moments after a low fuel pressure alarm sounded in the engine room, the leaking fuel ignited against the hot engine surfaces, causing a large explosion that was visible on the engine room CCTV. The engines were stopped immediately and all fuel pumps switched off. Crew members attempting to enter the engine area to fight to fire with fire hoses were forced to turn back from the intense heat. 6 minutes into the fire, the engine room overhead fire sprinkler system was activated along with the ship's general emergency alarm. The sprinklers appeared to have extinguished the fire after 4 minutes, and crew once again attempted to re-enter the engine area, only to have the residual fuel in the engine area ignite a flash fire that was quickly extinguished with fire hoses. During the subsequent inspection of the engine room and surrounding areas, burning wires were discovered in an adjacent compartment. The space was evacuated before lowering watertight doors and releasing 885 kg of halon and restarting the overhead sprinkler system. 3 hours after the first fire broke out, the incident was logged as resolved. The ship was able to return to Bermuda under reduced power, and was subsequently taken out of service for 2 weeks for repairs. Total expenses and lost revenue related to the fire totaled over $8.8 million.|$|E
40|$|The three {{critical}} components within a bolted, flanged connection are the flanges, gasket, and bolts. Until recently, simplified <b>flange</b> <b>assembly</b> target torque values for ASME B 16. 5 flanges were routinely determined by considering {{just one or}} two of these primary components. One approach considers only the gasket. Gasket-based target torque values are selected to optimize the gasket’s sealing performance by ensuring compression between minimum and maximum seating stress ranges, or based upon achieving specific levels of gasket Tightness (Tp). Another approach, fastener-based torque values, simply targets a specific bolt preload during assembly, typically some percentage of bolt material yield stress. A third approach optimizes gasket seating stress or tightness within the specific preload stress range o...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} vacuum <b>flange</b> <b>assembly</b> in the PS Booster (PSB) {{was designed}} to present insulation at low frequency and conduction to the beam image current above 2 MHz. However, {{in order to satisfy}} the needs for the LHC, the RF harmonic in the PSB had to be changed from h= 5 to h= 1, leading to a reduction of the lowest accelerating frequency to 600 kHz. The RF component of the beam was therefore passing through the main resonance of these flanges giving a total (integrated around the ring) longitudinal coupling impedance of 1000 : at 750 kHz, taking into account some additional RF bypasses. The voltage generated by the beam current was coupling to various electronic devices which therefore had to be equipped with common-mode rejection circuits. After some non-essential insulated flanges had bee...|$|E

40|$|During initial {{operation}} of the first linac module, energy gain {{was found to be}} much lower due to various problems which are now identified and solved. A novel way of damping mechanical vibration was implemented to reduce RF power. Cooling was improved by installing a hemispherical structure on the resonator. The drive coupler was redesigned to eliminate metal coating. Design of the tuner/transition <b>flange</b> <b>assemblies</b> was modified to avoid cold leak. After incorporation of these modifications, a few on-line beam accelerations through Linac were accomplished. In one of the beam acceleration, pulsed (1. 3 ns) Silicon beam of 130 MeV from Pelletron accelerator was further bunched to 250 ps by SC Superbuncher. After acceleration through the linac module and subsequent re-bunching using SC Rebuncher (RB), 158 MeV Silicon beam having pulse width of 400 ps was delivered to conduct experiments...|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Photon Source (APS) {{incorporates}} a 7 -GeV positron storage ring 1104 meters in circumference. The storage ring vacuum {{system is designed}} to maintain a pressure of 1 nTorr or less with a circulating current of 300 mA to enable beam lifetimes of greater than 10 hours. The vacuum chamber is an aluminum extrusion of 6063 T 5 alloy. There are 235 separate aluminum vacuum chambers in the storage ring connected by stainless steel bellows assemblies. Aluminum was chosen for the vacuum chamber {{because it can be}} economically extruded and machined, has good thermal conductivity, low thermal emissivity, a low outgassing rate, low residual radioactivity, and is non-magnetic. The 6063 aluminum-silicon-magnesium alloy provides high strength combined with good machining and weldability characteristics. The extrusion process provides the interior surface finish needed for the ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environments There are six different vacuum chambers with the same extrusion cross section.

40|$|Gaskets are an {{integral}} part of the sealing process provided by bolted flange assemblies. Depending upon service conditions, a seal must prevent leakage in the presence of internal pressure, axial loads, and bending loads. In some conditions they must respond to high temperatures and corrosive environments. All of these factors work against the ability of the gasket to provide a reliable barier to leakage. Two separate experimental investigations were undertaken to test the capabilities of a composite gasket designed and manufactured by Pikotek. The first series of tests involved a 6 -in Class 1500 # <b>flange</b> <b>assembly</b> with a Pikotek gasket. The gasket was subjected to a hydrostatic pressure of 9, 900 psi and a cyclic pressure test to 6, 600 psi using nitrogen gas. Bending moments exceeding 130, 000 ft-lbs were applied simultaneously with 5, 000 psi internal pressure nitrogen gas. No leaks occurred during any of the above loading conditions. Even though the flanges were rated per ANSI B 16. 5 to only 3, 705 psig, the gasket design permitted pressure containment far in excess of this value. The second series of tests were conducted on a 2 -in 2500 # gasket and <b>flange</b> <b>assembly.</b> Experimentation involved gas test pressures up to 18, 550 psig and cyclic temperature testing between OaF and 300 °F. The test procedure was based upon the methods outlined in API 6 A, Appendix F. The gasket performed successfully during all phases of testing. As with the 6 -in gasket, testing revealed that the gasket sealed at pressures much higher than those specified in ANSI B 16. 5. The abilty to qualify flange assemblies at pressures in excess of the specified ratings, using the appropriate analytical and testing procedures in compliance with industry standards, results in significant cost and weight savings for the end user. From an application standpoint, composite gaskets serve as an important alternative to current gasket designs and their associated limitations...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to ascertain the condition of braze joints and cooling water hardware from an accelerator section after prolonged use. Metallographic analysis was used to examine critical sites on an accelerator section that had been in use for more than 30 years. The end <b>flange</b> <b>assembly</b> showed no internal operational damage or external environmental effects. The cavity cylinder stack showed no internal operational damage however the internal surface was highly oxidized. The internal surface of the cooling water tubing was uniformly corroding at a rate of about 1 mil per year and showed no evidence of pitting. Tee fitting internal surfaces are corroding at non-uniform rates due to general corrosion and pitting. Remaining service life of the cooling water jacket is estimated to be about 20 years or year 2027. At this time, water supply pressure will exceed allowable fitting pressure due to corrosion of tubing walls...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether a single 7 / 8 ” nominal diameter stud bolt and nuts assembly would fail to perform its required function in a <b>flange</b> <b>assembly</b> when the nut was corroded. This work was undertaken to form a basis for further work in development of a Fitness-For-Service (FFS) assessment for corroded nuts. No current quantitative assessments exist for this area. A failure criterion was defined as a minimum 206. 8 MPa stress in the stud, based on the bolting requirements stated in ASME B 16. 5 - 2003 Pipe Flanges and Flanges Fittings. A simple test rig was manufactured for testing the compliance of the corroded nuts subjected to the 206. 8 MPa stress level and the corrosion was simulated by removing uniform layers of material from the surface of the nut. Finite Element Analysis (ANSYS 12. 0) was also performed to evaluate the test rig and to consider the interaction between the nut and stud at the thread roots. It was found that no failure occurred in the threading and that failure of the assembly only occurred when there was a > 60 % material loss from the nut. The failure mode experienced was deformation of the flange plate. This analysis proved that a nut can experience significant effective material loss without damaging the flange integrity...|$|E
40|$|A robot {{serviced}} space facility includes multiple modules {{which are}} identical in physical structure, but selectively differing in function. and purpose. Each module includes multiple like attachment points which are identically placed on each module {{so as to}} permit interconnection with immediately adjacent modules. Connection is made through like outwardly extending <b>flange</b> <b>assemblies</b> having identical male and female configurations for interconnecting to and locking to a complementary side of another flange. Multiple rows of interconnected modules permit force, fluid, data and power transfer to be accomplished by redundant circuit paths. Redundant modules of critical subsystems are included. Redundancy of modules and of interconnections results in a space complex with any module being removable upon demand, either for module replacement or facility reconfiguration. without eliminating any vital functions of the complex. Module replacement and facility assembly or reconfiguration are accomplished by a computer controlled articulated walker type robotic manipulator arm assembly having two identical end-effectors {{in the form of}} male configurations which are identical to those on module flanges and which interconnect to female configurations on other flanges. The robotic arm assembly moves along a connected set or modules by successively disconnecting, moving and reconnecting alternate ends of itself to a succession of flanges in a walking type maneuver.

Using a mock-up assembly, multiple gasket materials and types including conversion gaskets were tested to evaluate relative performance based on amount of bolt preload loss as measured {{through the use of}} load-indicating studs. To simulate field geometry, most tests included a spacer in the flange pair, which necessitated use of two (2) gaskets in the joint.

40|$|The {{recognised}} {{standard method}} of gasketed flanged joint design contained within most pressure vessel codes is {{that based on}} the Taylor Forge procedure (Trans ASME 59 (1937) 161). This has, as its basis, bolt load calculations, which are designed to apply sufficient load to both seat and initialise the gasket, and to ensure sealing via a gasket when the operational pressure load is present. The flange ring and hub transmit the bolt load to the gasket and must therefore be stiff and flat. However, there are many real situations where additional loads arise through external pulling and bending. This is commonly seen in piping systems and other flanged pressure equipment. Although the codes do not specifically address the 'combined load' problem, the normal method for considering this additional load is to form an equivalent pressure. This over-pressure is calculated by making the stress generated in the pipe or vessel wall, by the external load, equal to a longitudinal pressure stress which may be tensile or compressive, depending {{on the nature of}} the load. This results in an over-pressure which can therefore be added to the operating pressure. For bending loads, no account is taken of the variation around the circumference, or the change in gasket seating width, which will vary as the flange faces rotate. In order to assess the effects of external loading on flanges, a combined load test rig has been constructed and a number of bolted <b>flange</b> <b>assemblies</b> examined including standard ANSI joints and compact VERAX VCF joints (Fig. 1 a and b). These assemblies have been strain gauged and tested for a variety of load conditions. Tests have been carried out using hydraulic fluid as the main pressurising medium.

40|$|Bolted {{flanged joints}} {{comprise}} an assembly {{of a number}} of important individual components, which are required to perform well together in service. The ideal requirement for a bolted flange joint is a 'zero-leak' condition. However, whilst recommended design procedures for bolted flange joints are available in international codes and standards, leakage problems are still faced by industry. These are common in both normal operating (internal pressure loading) and critical event conditions. The drive is, therefore, to find a <b>flange</b> joint <b>assembly,</b> which provides 'zero-leak condition' and requires little or no maintenance and handling. Considerable investigation in the area of optimised bolted joints has been in progress for the past 10 years comparing traditional gasketed joints and 'compact non-gasketed' joints, using both analytical and experimental approaches. In this present study, two-dimensional non-linear finite element studies have been performed for both gasketed and non-gasketed bolted flange pipe joints. Based on the stress results for the flange and the bolt and the flange rotation/displacement, compact non-gasketed flange joints are shown to be a viable and preferable alternative to the conventional gasketed flange joints. Recommendations are made for a best-fit flange model for static load conditions with 'zero-leak' sealing in a flange joint...|$|R

40|$|The two-axis joint is a {{mechanical}} device that provides two-degrees-of-freedom motion between connected components. A compact, moment-resistant, two-axis joint {{is used to}} connect an electromechanical actuator to its driven structural members. Due {{to the requirements of}} the overall mechanism, the joint has a low profile to fit within the allowable space, low friction, and high moment-reacting capability. The mechanical arrangement of this joint can withstand high moments when loads are applied. These features allow the joint to be used in tight spaces where a high load capability is required, as well as in applications where penetrating the mounting surface is not an option or where surface mounting is required. The joint consists of one base, one clevis, one cap, two needle bearings, and a circular shim. The base of the joint is the housing (the base and the cap together), and is connected to the grounding structure via fasteners and a bolt pattern. Captive within the housing, between the base and the cap, are the rotating clevis and the needle bearings. The clevis is attached to the mechanical system (linear actuator) via a pin. This pin, and the rotational movement of the clevis with respect to the housing, provides two rotational degrees of freedom. The larger diameter flange of the clevis is sandwiched between a pair of needle bearings, one {{on each side of the}} <b>flange.</b> During the <b>assembly</b> of the two-axis joint, the circular shims are used to adjust the amount of preload that is applied to the needle bearings. The above arrangement enables the joint to handle high moments with minimal friction. To achieve the high-moment capability within a low-profile joint, the use of depth of engagement (like that of a conventional rotating shaft) to react moment is replaced with planar engagement parallel to the mounting surface. The needle bearings with the clevis flange provide the surface area to react the clevis loads/moments into the joint housing while providing minimal friction during rotation. The diameter of the flange and the bearings can be increased to react higher loads and still maintain a compact surface mounting capability. This type of joint can be used in a wide variety of mechanisms and mechanical systems. It is especially effective where precise, smooth, continuous motion is required. For example, the joint can be used at the end of a linear actuator that is required to extend and rotate simultaneously. The current design application is for use in a spacecraft docking-system capture mechanism. Other applications might include industrial robotic or assembly line apparatuses, positioning systems, or in the motion-based simulator industry that employs complex, multi-axis manipulators for various types of motions...|$|R
40|$|Components made of fiber-reinforced {{plastics}} make {{an important}} contribution to reducing vehicle weight in the automotive industry. Recent developments show an increasing industrial interest in integrating fiber-reinforced plastics in existing metal structures. One challenge is the appropriate joining of these hybrid structures. It is important to avoid interrupting or damaging of the fiber flows, to take the forces in the joining area as homogeneous as possible, to ensure sufficient skin quality and to meet corrosion-technical requirements - especially when joining carbon fiber reinforced plastics with metals. This research project examined the joining of an CFRP structural component with a metallic outer skin part by hem flange bonding. Such hybrid FRP-metal assembly combines the outstanding properties of both materials in the composite, while the hem flange bonding ensures optimum connectivity. The embedding of the joining process in the existing process chains and the use of existing plant technology for the production of automobile hang on parts among OEMs and suppliers promise a rapid implementation of the results. The advantages mentioned are facing new challenges resulting from both the manufacturing process chain {{as well as from the}} operating conditions and material-specific properties. Within the project the following issues were examined: Joining process: According to the specified materials and process boundary conditions, suitable adhesives were chosen. These have been studied and characterized both in situ and in the hem flange. The hem flange bonding of steel-CFRP and aluminum-CFRP assemblies was studied in different model geometries using tabletop hemming and roller hemming. Here, the hemming result was evaluated and the CFRP inner part was examined for possible damage. The results show that the forces during the hemming process do not lead to any structural damage in the CFRP. Thermal stress: If the hem flange bonding of the hybrid assembly is implemented in the common process chain, there are heatings up to 200 ° C in the subsequent coating process. This results in the so-called delta-apha-problem because the coefficient of thermal expansion of the outer metal part is significantly higher than the FRP inner part, resulting in relative movements during heating and cooling of the assembly. The expansion of the parts, the relative movements in the composite and the warpage occurring after the adhesive curing were recorded and evaluated. In addition, the description of the processes in the furnace as well as forecasts of war page were carried out by numerical simulation. Then constructive measures were examined in order to reduce the warpage of hem <b>flange</b> bonded hybrid <b>assemblies.</b> Joint properties: The strength of the bonded CFRP-metal hem flanges was determined and evaluated in peel tests and 3 -point bending tests. In 3 -point bending test it was proved that the hem flange not fails even for large sample deformation. The corrosion of metal-CFRP hybrid assemblies is essentially affected by disbonding of adhesive at metal surface and defects or critical areas in the hem flange. Good corrosion protection performance could be achieved by optimization of hemming parameters and selection of suitable adhesives...|$|R
