40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{mechanisms}} controlling <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> in [&plusmn; 30 &deg; / &plusmn; 30 &deg;/ 90 &deg;/ 90 &deg] composites {{have been}} studied. <b>Edge</b> <b>delamination</b> strength and fracture toughness were strongly {{dependent on the}} resin matrices. For the same resin matrix, however, these prop-erties drastically and consistently varied with the fibers studied, suggesting a fiber/matrix interface-controlled mechanism. Failure analyses using microscopy techniques revealed corresponding variations of fiber/matrix adhesion and crack paths. As the fiber/matrix adhesion decreased, the dominant crack paths in the laminates changed from straight &mdash; 30 &deg;/ 90 &deg; interply failure to zig-zag 90 &deg; intraply failure. The critical role of fiber/matrix adhesion on <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> was demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{method was}} developed for describing the <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> stress intensity characteristics in angle-ply composite laminates. The method {{is based on the}} theory of anisotropic elasticity. The <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> problem is formulated using Lekhnitskii's complex-variable stress potentials and an especially developed eigenfunction expansion method. The method predicts exact orders of the three-dimensional stress singularity in a delamination crack tip region. With the aid of boundary collocation, the method predicts the complete stress and displacement fields in a finite-dimensional, delaminated composite. Fracture mechanics parameters such as the mixed-mode stress intensity factors and associated energy release rates for <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> can be calculated explicity. Solutions are obtained for edge delaminated (theta/-theta theta/-theta) angle-ply composites under uniform axial extension. Effects of delamination lengths, fiber orientations, lamination and geometric variables are studied...|$|E

Both the <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> test (EDT) and the double-cantilever-beam (DCB) test provided a useful ranking of improvements in delamination resistance between brittle and tough resin composites. Several layups {{were designed for}} the <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> test to cover {{a wide range of}} mixed-mode conditions. The DCB and the various layups of the EDT were then used to characterize the interlaminar fracture behavior of brittle and toughened resin composites subjected to both static and cyclic loading...|$|E

40|$|A new four-point bending plate (4 PBP) {{test was}} used for characterising the mode III interlaminar {{fracture}} of carbon/epoxy laminates. The specimen has a cross-ply lay-up and two <b>edge</b> <b>delaminations</b> whose propagation becomes visible at the edges. Although the test setup is very simple, determination of the mode III critical strain energy release rate GIIIc requires finite element analyses (FEA). The virtual crack closure technique with an assumed initiation region was first proposed for computing GIIIc. This scheme was subsequently validated by crack growth simulations with a cohesive zone model. The results showed an average GIIIc = 1550 J/m 2, which is {{significantly higher than the}} GIIIc = 850 to 1100 J/m 2 and GIIc = 800 J/m 2 measured in previous studies.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) {{finite element}} analysis on a newly developed type of coupler for glass-fibre-reinforced plastic (GRP) pipes under an internal pressure loading is presented. The stress distribution within the coupler is inhomogeneous with apparent stress concentrations located at the pipe and the coupler <b>edges.</b> <b>Delamination</b> and debonding are the main failure modes. Therefore, a fracture mechanical approach is preferred {{in the design of}} the coupler instead of a purely strength-based failure criterion evaluation. The strain-energy release rates evaluated at the critical delamination sites are used as a performance measure of the coupler. A comparative parametric study is carried out to allow for the dimensioning and shaping of the coupler as well as for the choice of an optimal stacking sequence. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.

A two parameter failure criterion, i. e. average interlaminar normal stress failure criterion on &sigma;=, has been used in conjunction with the stress analysis done by applying the global local model [5]. A comparison between the experimental and the predicted <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> threshold strengths has been made.

By way of a simple regular finite lement method, the method of mutual integral, wherein generalized plane strain solutions are employed asauxiliary fields, is applied to <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> cracks to obtain the complex stress intensities.

40|$|A {{fracture}} mechanics damage methodology to predict <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> is described. The methodology accounts for residual thermal stresses, cyclic thermal stresses, and cyclic mechanical stresses. The modeling {{is based on}} the classical lamination theory and a sublaminate theory. The prediction methodology determines the strain energy release rate, G, {{at the edge of a}} laminate and compares it with the fatigue and fracture toughness of the composite. To verify the methodology, isothermal static tests at 23, 125, and 175 C and tension-tension fatigue tests at 23 and 175 C were conducted on laminates. The material system used was a carbon/bismaleimide, IM 7 / 5260. Two quasi-isotropic layups were used. Also, 24 ply unidirectional double cantilever beam specimens were tested to determine the fatigue and fracture toughness of the composite at different temperatures. Raising the temperature had the effect of increasing the value of G at the edge for these layups and also to lower the fatigue and fracture toughness of the composite. The static stress to <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> was not affected by temperature but the number of cycles to <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> decreased...|$|E
40|$|Embedded fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors are {{utilized}} to characterize a delamination in glass fibre-reinforced epoxy (GF/EP) composite laminates using a static strain method. Composite beams with different <b>edge</b> <b>delaminations</b> in the thickness-wise direction are {{monitored by the}} FBG sensors, whose centres are located at delamination tips of the beams, under a three-point bending test. A surface bonded strain gauge is employed to calibrate the FBG sensor using the bending test. Moreover, strain distribution within the sensing region of the delaminated composite beams is numerically calculated by the finite element method (FEM). FEM results establish {{the relationship between the}} strain distribution of the beams and the shape of reflection spectra from the FBG sensors. A correlation between delamination location in the thickness-wise direction of the beams and the shape of the reflection spectra is then highlighted. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{studies the}} effect of edge {{stitching}} on tensile static and fatigue properties of graphite fiber reinforced laminates. The influence of Kevlar stitchings on <b>edge</b> <b>delaminations,</b> ultimate tensile strength and tension-tension fatigue life were examined on laminates of two stacking sequences ([± 45 / 0 / 90]s and [± 30 / 90]s), as representative of two classes of fiber-dominated and matrix-dominated laminates. Through-thickness stitching offered a significant improvement in the static delamination resistance of laminated composites, but had varying effects on the ultimate tensile stress of the laminates under study, {{with an increase in}} strength of [± 30 / 90]s laminates and a decrease in strength of [± 45 / 0 / 90]s laminates. Similarly the fatigue life of matrix dominated [± 30 / 90]s specimens was considerably extended by stitching, while the fatigue resistance of fiber-dominated [± 45 / 0 / 90]s specimens was reduced, particularly at high fatigue stresses. Stitching appeared very efficient in arresting delamination in [± 30 / 90]s specimens for both static and fatigue loads, but did not prove to be as efficient in stopping fatigue delaminations in [± 45 / 0 / 90]s specimens, since Kevlar threads were found to be prone to breakage under cyclic loading. As a conclusion, while the static delamination resistance of laminated composites is improved by stitching, this does not automatically result in better fatigue performance for all lamination sequences...|$|R

Thornel 300 / 5208 composites {{with and without}} holes were subjected to static and tensile fatigue testing. Five (5) fiber orientations were submitted to test. Tensile fatigue testing also included three (3) loading conditions and two (2) frequencies. The low-cycle test specimens demonstrated a shorter tensile fatigue life than the high-cycle test specimens. Failure surfaces demonstrated effect of testing conditions. Secondary failure mechanisms, such as: delamination, fiber breakage, and <b>edge</b> fiber <b>delamination</b> were present. Longitudinal delamination between plies also occurred in these specimens...|$|R
40|$|An {{equation}} {{was derived}} for the strain energy release rate, G, associated with local delamination growth from a matrix ply crack. The critical GC for <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> onset in 25 / 902 s graphite epoxy laminates was measured {{and used in}} this equation to predict local delamination onset strains in 25 / 90 ns, n = 4, 6, 8 laminates. A simple technique for predicting strain concentrations in the primary load bearing plies near local delaminations was developed. These strain concentrations were responsible for reduced laminate nominal failure strains in laminates containing local delaminations. The influence of <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> and matrix crack tip delamination on laminate stiffness and strength was compared...|$|E
40|$|Free <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> of uniaxially {{stressed}} layered specimens is simulated using non-linear {{finite element}} analysis. Generalized plane strain elements and interface elements {{have been developed}} for this purpose. Thermal and hygroscopic effects have been taken into account for the modelling of the plys, and a mode-I fracture model which incorporates strain softening has been used for the interface behaviour. The out-of-plane loading is controlled via an indirect displacement control technique, which permits tracing the entire loading history. Using non-linear finite element analysis free <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> in different graphite/epoxy laminates is examined. The numerical results are in good agreement with experimental evidence and do not suffer from spurious mesh dependence. Also the effects of laminate thickness (size effect) can be described properly...|$|E
40|$|A damage {{evolution}} theory {{capable of}} predicting {{the effects of}} <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> phenomena on composite laminate response is developed. The theory is a mechanics-based formulation which quantifies the damage development of a laminate under general loading, and incorporates it directly to the constitutive behavior of the laminate. The theoretical development introduces a laminate-specific constant φ; the methodology of φ selection is presented for [± 15 /± 50]s, [± 45 / 0 / 90]s, and [0 ₂/ 90 ₂]s T 300 graphite/epoxy laminates. Edge effects are demonstrated by comparing the damage state of the above laminates with and without <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> damage.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a novel method {{to monitor the}} bonding condition of active fiber composites (AFCs). AFCs {{can be used as}} integrated acoustic sensors/actuators to compose functional structures because of their excellent properties. Debonds between AFC patch and host structure should be avoided and surveyed through its service life. A partially debonded patch bears an axial extensional vibration which is excited by a sinusoidal voltage and detected by the interdigital electrodes symmetrically aligned on opposite surfaces of the patch. The electric impedance and mechanical displacement of the AFC patch adhered on an aluminum plate were investigated in a broad frequency range. The modal characteristics depend on the size of debond and stiffness of adhesive in front of the <b>edge</b> of <b>delamination.</b> The debonding ratio of the AFC patch is in inverse proportion to the resonant frequency of the fundamental mode. Feasibility of self-detecting the progressive delamination between AFC patch and host plate is demonstrated through computational and experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid metal/CFRP {{laminates}} {{are considered}} for aerospace structural applications since by combining both material classes {{it is possible}} to utilize the advantageous properties of both and overcoming their weaknesses. In metal/CFRP hybrid laminate architectures, the metal fraction improves the impact resistance, and metal layers at the outer surface protect the CFRP core from environmental effects, such as ultraviolet radiation, moisture, and abrasive wear. CFRP provides high strength and high stiffness along with low weight. However, the interface between metal and CFRP implicates a higher complexity than interfaces between similar materials. E. g. differences in stiffness lead to shear stresses at free <b>edges</b> promoting <b>delamination</b> fracture. A test configuration considered for characterizing resistance against interfacial fracture is the lap shear test, which is not standardized for hybrid laminates. In order to assure the validity of experimental results, the effects of the chosen specimen geometry and experimental setup has been comprehensively investigated by means of experiments and numerical analyses...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{analysis}} of flexible delaminated layered beams is revisited. Exploiting Boolean vectors, a novel assembly scheme is developed {{which can be}} used to enforce the continuity requirements at the <b>edges</b> of <b>delamination</b> region, leading to a delamination stiffness term. The proposed assembly technique can be used to form various beam configurations with through-width delaminations, irrespective of the formulation used to model each beam segment. The proposed assembly system and the Galerkin Finite Element Method (FEM) formulation are subsequently used to investigate the natural frequencies and modes of 2 - and 3 -layer beam configurations. Using the Euler-Bernoulli bending beam theory and free mode delamination, the governing differential equations are exploited and two beam finite elements are developed. The free bending vibration of three illustrative example problems, characterized by delamination zones of variable length, is investigated.

The delamination growth rate obeyed a power-law function of the applied strain energy release rate range. The prefactor on the power-law function showed a strong dependence on temperature. In addition, experiments were performed on laminates with ± 30 ° plies. The primary damage mode in this lay-up was <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> of the interior plies.

A constitutive model based on nonlinear fracture mechanics is used to describe delamination. An orthotropic softening plasticity model is used to determine the initiation and propagation of delamination. Although the orthotropic yield surface is based on stresses, it is proved, that, in combination with a softening type of post-failure response controlled by the fracture toughness, the approach results in a unique {{and physically}} realistic solution upon mesh refinement. The results from the nonlinear finite element computations, including predictive analysis, are compared with mode-I and mixed-mode free <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> experiments.

40|$|The {{debonding}} of a skin/stringer specimen {{subjected to}} tension was studied using threedimensional volume element modeling and computational fracture mechanics. Mixed mode strain energy release rates were calculated from finite element results using the virtual crack closure technique. The simulations revealed {{an increase in}} total energy release rate {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the free edges of the specimen. Correlation of the computed mixed-mode strain energy release rates along the delamination front contour with a two-dimensional mixed-mode interlaminar fracture criterion suggested that in spite of peak total energy release rates at the free <b>edge</b> the <b>delamination</b> would not advance at the edges first. The qualitative prediction of the shape of the delamination front was confirmed by X-ray photographs of a specimen taken during testing.

The analysis includes the contribution of residual thermal and moisture stresses to the strain energy released. The strain energy release rate, G, increased when residual thermal effects were combined with applied mechanical strains, but then decreased when increasing moisture content was included. A quasi-three-dimensional finite element analysis indicated identical trends and demonstrated these same trends for the individual strain energy release rate components, G sub I and G sub II, associated with interlaminar tension and shear. An experimental study indicated that for T 300 / 5208 graphite-epoxy composites, the inclusion of residual thermal and moisture stresses did not significantly alter the calculation of interlaminar fracture toughness from strain energy release rate analysis of <b>edge</b> <b>delamination</b> data taken at room temperature, ambient conditions...|$|E

In the model thermoplastic system (polycarbonate matrix), surface properties of the graphite fiber were shown to be significant. Cricital strain energy release rates for two different fibers having similar nominal tensile properties differed by 30 to 60 percent. The reason for the difference is not clear. Interlaminar toughness values for the thermoplastic polyimide composites (LARC-TPI and polyimidesulfone) were 3 to 4 in-lb/sq in. Scanning electron micrographs of the EDT fracture surfaces suggest poor fiber/matrix bonding.

Material coupons can easily be tested under this type of loading in servo-hydraulic tension/torsion test stands using techniques {{very similar to those}} used for the <b>Edge</b> <b>Delamination</b> Tensile Test (EDT) delamination specimen. <b>Edge</b> <b>delamination</b> of specimens loaded in tension was successfully analyzed by several investigators using both classical laminate theory and quasi-three dimensional (Q 3 D) finite element techniques.

The Q 3 D analysis is very efficient since it produces a three-dimensional solution to a two-dimensional domain. A computer program was developed which generates PATRAN commands to generate the finite element model. PATRAN is a pre- and post-processor which is commonly used with a variety of finite element programs such as MCS/NASTRAN. The program creates a sufficiently dense mesh at the delamination crack tips to support a mixed-mode fracture mechanics analysis. The program creates a coarse mesh in those regions where the gradients in the stress field are low (away from the delamination regions). A transition mesh is defined between these regions. This program is capable of generating a mesh for an arbitrarily oriented matrix crack.

40|$|An {{asymptotically}} exact {{cross-sectional model}} coupled with geometrically nonlinear one-dimensional (1 D) theory is developed for a thin composite strip {{in the presence}} of defects. Two types of defects are considered: intralaminar cracks and interlaminar cracks. Model development is based on the dimensional reduction of laminated shell theory to nonlinear 1 D theory using the variational asymptotic method. The cross-sectional nonlinearity accounts for matrix cracks, quantified in terms of crack density and delamination, quantified in terms of the delamination width. For modeling intralaminar cracks continuum damage mechanics based framework is used along with computational micromechanics to account for intralaminar cracks in laminate plies in different orientations. Delamination modeling follows a methodology adapted from the sublaminate approach. The model developed is used to investigate the effect of defects on the trapeze effect -nonlinear axial-twist coupling in strip with Winckler kind of layup. It was found that cracks in transverse plies enhance the trapeze effect; on the contrary, symmetric <b>edge</b> midsurface <b>delamination</b> leads to decrease in the coupling effect. This contrarian behavior of the two types of defects on the trapeze effect is explained on the effect these defects have on the various cross-sectional coupling stiffness terms influencing the coupling behavior.
