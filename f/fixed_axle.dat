50|$|The Klien-Lindner axle uses a double, or hollow, axle, one {{inside the}} other. It has a hollow axle (Hohlachse) on the outside, {{connected}} at its centre by a Cardan joint to a fixed driving axle running through it. The Cardan joint comprises two spherical {{elements that are}} interlinked - a solid one on the <b>fixed</b> <b>axle</b> and a hollow one on the outer hollow axle, each oriented at 90° to the other that transfer the driving forces from the rigid axle to the hollow one. The hollow spheroid acts {{as a sort of}} link motion. In this way the hollow axle can be turned by the <b>fixed</b> <b>axle.</b> In addition, the connecting link is shaped so that the axles can slide relative to one another, parallel to their axes, to a small extent. The degree to which the hollow axle can swivel is set by the outer diameter of the <b>fixed</b> <b>axle</b> and the internal diameter of the hollow one.|$|E

2500|$|The plateway {{was one of}} {{the first}} users of the patent [...] that was {{designed}} by John Collinge of Bridge Road, Lambeth. This axle was largely used for road vehicles and a few other applications to rail vehicles. It implies that the wheels rotated on <b>fixed</b> <b>axles,</b> and, until its introduction, wheels had to be removed and axle arms greased at least once a day when travelling any distance.|$|R
50|$|Intense trial runs {{were made}} with the prototypes. They had bogies with <b>fixed</b> <b>axles,</b> which led to heavy rail and wheel flange abrasion. Despite some early {{technical}} issues, the SBB-CFF-FFS were convinced {{they were on the}} right path with the development of the Ae 6/6. After introducing side-elastic wheelsets and making the wheel flanges of the middle axles smaller, the series production started in 1954, resulting in the first series locomotives delivered in 1955.|$|R

50|$|Mallet found typical {{main line}} {{railways}} unwilling to adopt his particular ideas and, in 1884, {{he started to}} propose compounding combined with articulation; on lightly engineered secondary lines this could give greater power to locomotives whose axle load and size was limited.

50|$|Until about 1880, four-wheeled {{compartment}} {{coaches were}} typical. After {{the end of}} the wave of nationalisations the Prussian state railways, around 1895, acquired the quieter-running six-wheelers. For this, so-called norms were established for four-, six- and, later, eight-wheeled classes of coach. For the six-wheelers, both <b>fixed</b> <b>axle</b> and sliding axle designs were envisaged. Those coaches designed specifically for suburban traffic (Berlin, Hamburg) had no toilets. On the other coaches, a gangway was specified {{in order to keep the}} number of toilets to a minimum for economic reasons. Numerous coaches had therefore to be converted. After {{the end of the}} 19th century, fourth class compartment coaches were also procured.|$|E

5000|$|The RS-4-TCs were {{originally}} built with Caterpillar D397 diesel engines.

There are two number systems for the RS-4-TCs, the 1200 series or the 4000 series. The locomotives in both series were the same, except the 1200s were built for domestic service and had <b>fixed</b> <b>axle,</b> standard gauge trucks while the 4000s were built for foreign service and had adjustable-gauge trucks for use on foreign narrow and wide gauge tracks. Even though the 4000s were built for foreign service, very few were actually deployed overseas, the vast majority served in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|A normal wheel (rotating {{around a}} <b>fixed</b> <b>axle)</b> must be {{circular}} in shape to allow smooth forward motion (without any vertical bumpiness). However, a loose [...] "roller" [...] (i.e. a cylindrical or pseudo-cylindrical rod) {{does not require}} a circular cross-section to allow smooth forward motion — any curve of constant width (as the cross-section of the roller) will work — including circular cross-sections of course, but also including Reuleaux-triangular cross-sections, and higher-sided curves of constant width. Therefore, if a flat transport-material is placed on two or more rollers (with cross-sectional-shapes that are curves of the same constant width) resting on a flat ground-surface, the transport-material will remain a constant height off the ground-surface as it is pushed forward (though the rollers themselves will appear to [...] "move in a curiously irregular manner" [...] if their shape is significantly non-circular).|$|E

50|$|A {{turntable}} at {{the rear}} of the chassis frame supported a bogey, mounted on bearings so it could swivel and pivot. The bogey was fitted with two <b>axles,</b> a <b>fixed</b> middle <b>axle</b> and a steerable rear axle, both of the swinging wishbone type with transverse semi-elliptical leaf spring suspension. The middle axle was fitted with pneumatic brakes, while the rear axle was unbraked. A feedback steering system was included in the design, so that any change in direction by the rear bogey (and <b>fixed</b> middle <b>axle)</b> was duplicated by the steerable rear axle, but to twice the extent. The linkage for the feedback system was for used front towing, and was disengaged during rear towing.|$|R
50|$|The {{narrow gauge}} line {{was a form}} of wagonway {{constructed}} to a gauge of 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) and equipped with four wheeled wagons fitted with double-flanged wheels, which were loose on <b>fixed</b> <b>axles.</b> For many of their later years many wagons had extended axles which protruded beyond the wheels. Some wagons had eyes bolted to the tops of their sides to enable them to be lifted bodily by the Blondins used in some of the quarries. The wagons were owned by the tramway, rather than the quarries and the many that survived into BR ownership had narrow steel plate bodies, which were mounted between the wheels and bolted to the axles. Their shape and structure appears little changed from the railway's earliest years.|$|R

Some users have reported that their robot's battery capacity are below what the manufacturer claimed of 70 to 100 minutes run time. They have to get the battery replaced to achieve the claimed run time. However, this issue has been resolved since early 2009 with its new battery supplier. The vacuum inlet is too narrow (approximately 1 cm) to take in anything bigger than something the size of a rice making picaBot eVo2 effective in picking up small particles, dust and hair but not pebbles or crumpled pieces of paper.|$|E
5000|$|The {{essence of}} the throw is that one throws the yo-yo with a very {{pronounced}} wrist action {{so that when the}} yo-yo reaches the end of the string it spins in place rather than rolling back up the string to the thrower's hand. Most modern yo-yos have a transaxle or ball bearing to assist this, but if it is a <b>fixed</b> <b>axle</b> yo-yo, the tension must be loose enough to allow this. The two main ways to do this are (1), allow the yo-yo to sit {{at the bottom of the}} string to unwind, or (2) perform lariat or UFO to loosen the tension. When one decides to end the [...] "sleeping" [...] state, one merely jerks the wrist and the yo-yo [...] "catches" [...] the string and rolls back up to the hand. Ball-bearing yo-yos with a [...] "butterfly" [...] shape, primarily used for string tricks, frequently (but not always) have low response (or are, in fact, completely unresponsive), requiring a [...] "bind" [...] for the yo-yo to return.|$|E

Seven predetermined positions were set to 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 cm relative to the <b>fixed</b> <b>axle</b> of the beam. The Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) scheme was then used to compensate the error. This kit is equipped with a user interface to configure controller coefficients, select the set points, plot the actual ball position, and display parameter values. The user interface program runs on PC or notebook connected to microcontroller via serial communications. A questionnaire-based assessment about the use of this kit was conducted by 17 students taking the course, giving a rating value of 94. 12 %. </script...|$|E

25|$|At {{the onset}} of the Civil War the South had a rail network disjointed and plagued by changes in track gauge as well as lack of interchange. Locomotives and freight cars had <b>fixed</b> <b>axles</b> and could not use tracks of {{different}} gauges (widths). Railroads of different gauges leading to the same city required all freight to be off-loaded onto wagons for transport to the connecting railroad station, where it had to await freight cars and a locomotive before proceeding. Centers requiring off-loading included Vicksburg, New Orleans, Montgomery, Wilmington and Richmond. In addition, most rail lines led from coastal or river ports to inland cities, with few lateral railroads. Due to this design limitation, the relatively primitive railroads of the Confederacy were unable to overcome the Union naval blockade of the South's crucial intra-coastal and river routes.|$|R
