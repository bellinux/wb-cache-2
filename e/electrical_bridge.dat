At present, the detectors are maintained at cryogenic temperatures by a stored volume of liquid helium.

The electrical connections over the temperature gradient account for approximately 20 % of the total heat load on the Dewar for some systems, accelerating the boil-off of liquid helium cryogen and reducing the operational lifetime of the space-borne instruments.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{technique}} {{has been developed}} which allows {{a single piece of}} piezoelec-tric material to concurrently sense and actuate in a closed loop system. The motivation behind the technique is that such a self-sensing actuator will be truly collocated and has applications in active and intelligent structures, such as vibration suppression. A theoreti-cal basis for the self-sensing actuator is given in terms of the electromechanical consti-tutive equations for a piezoelectric material. In a practical implementation of the self-sensing actuator an <b>electrical</b> <b>bridge</b> circuit is used to measure strain. The bridge circuit is capable of measuring either strain or time rate of strain in the actuator. The usefulness of the proposed device was experimentally verified by actively damping the vibration in a cantilever beam. A single piezoceramic element bonded {{to the base of the}} beam functioned both as a distributed moment actuator and strain sensor. Using a rate feedback control law, the first mode of vibration was suppressed, reducing the settling from 35 seconds to 2. 5 seconds. Using a positive position feedback law the first two modes of vibration were suppressed; the first mode settling time was reduced from 35 to 0. 3 sec-onds and the second mode settling time was reduced from 7 seconds to 0. 9 seconds...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to the application of a large-scale first-principles approach to study the electronic structure and quantum conductance of realistic nanomaterials. Three systems are studied using Landauer formalism, Green's function technique and maximally localized Wannier functions. The main focus of this thesis lies on clarifying the effect of chemical modifications on electron transport at the nanoscale, as well as on predicting and designing new type of molecular and nanoelectronic devices. In the first study, we suggest and investigate a quantum interference effect in the porphyrin family molecules. We show that the transmission through a porphyrin molecule at or near the Fermi level varies by orders of magnitude following hydrogen tautomerization. The switching behavior identified in porphyrins implies new application directions in single molecular devices and molecular-size memory elements. Moving on from single molecules to a larger scale, we study the effect of chemical functionalizations to the transport properties of carbon nanotubes. We propose several covalent functionalization schemes for carbon nanotubes which display switchable on/off conductance in metallic tubes. The switching action is achieved by reversible control of bond-cleavage chemistry in [1 + 2] cycloadditions, via the 8 p 3 8 s p 2 rehybridization it induces; this leads to remarkable changes of conductance even at very low degrees of functionalization. Several strategies for real-time control on the conductance of carbon nanotubes are then proposed. Such designer functional groups would allow for the first time direct control of the electrical properties of metallic carbon nanotubes, with extensive applications in nanoscale devices. In {{the last part of the}} thesis we address the issue of low electrical conductivity observed in carbon nanotube networks. We characterize intertube tunneling between carbon nanotube junctions with or without a covalent linker, and explore the possibility of improving intertube coupling and enhance electrical tunneling by transition metal adsorptions on CNT surfaces. The strong hybridization between transition metal d orbitals with the CNT [pi] orbitals serves as an excellent <b>electrical</b> <b>bridge</b> for a broken carbon nanotube junction. The binding and coupling between a transition metal atom and sandwiching nanotubes can be even stronger in case of nitrogendoped carbon nanotubes. Our studies suggest a more effective strategy than the current cross-linking methods used in carbon nanotube networks. by Elise Yu-Tzu Li. Thesis (Ph. D.)
