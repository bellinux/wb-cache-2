Although a few countries in Middle East export electric power, most production is for domestic consumption. In Middle East, the crucial role of electricity is attributable to the extreme climate.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{methods and}} models for assessing {{reliability of supply}} and infrastructural dependency in energy distribution systems with multiple energy carriers. The three energy carriers of electric power, natural gas and district heating are considered. Models and methods for assessing reliability of supply in electric power systems are well documented, frequently applied in the industry and continuously being subject to research and improvement. On the contrary, there are comparatively few examples of formal reliability assessment models and methods applied to natural gas and district heating systems. This work aims at contributing to bridge this gap, considering the structural, operational and physical {{similarities and differences between}} the systems. A method for evaluating the reliability of supply in natural gas distribution systems is presented, based on state-of-the-art reliability calculations from the electric power domain. Furthermore, a novel modelling approach incorporating pipeline storage in reliability evaluation of high-pressure natural gas pipeline systems is presented. Parallel energy infrastructures depend on each other at different levels, two of which are addressed in this work. First, by introducing a second energy carrier in an area dominated by electric power, the type of <b>energy</b> <b>end-uses</b> served by the electric power system is affected. An optimisation problem is formulated, finding the optimal allocation of switchgear in an electric power distribution system. It is shown how changes in <b>energy</b> <b>end-uses</b> cause changes in the expected customer interruption costs, which in turn affects the optimisation problem. Second, the dependency of district heating systems on electric power is modelled. Network models for the two systems are coupled, and the consequences of higher-order power system failures are quantified for both systems. The methods and approaches presented in this thesis are demonstrated by use of simple examples, and applied to test networks and case studies. </p...|$|R
40|$|The food {{processing}} industry {{is the fourth}} largest consumer {{of energy in the}} US industrial sector. Food processors use nearly 1, 200 trillion Btu of energy per year. The industry is comprised of more than 21, 000 processing plants. Total production values make it $ 400 billion industry. While energy represents on average between one and two percent of total operating costs, in some industry sub-sectors energy comprises as much as 20 %. Major <b>energy</b> <b>end-uses</b> include drying, refrigeration, process heating and cooling, and machine drives. Energy efficiency becomes more important in an industry of tight margins. Today, Americans spend the same percentage of disposable income on food as they did 20 years ago. The Food Marketing Institute notes that supermarket sales were only expected to rise about 2 % in 2000. Rising energy costs, increasing restrictions on land application of waste, sanitation standards, and a high demand for product quality, and processed foods contribute to the industry's energy and power quality needs. In addition to documenting a variety of energy end uses in the industry in spring 2000, E SOURCE surveyed 148 plant managers by telephone and conducted in-depth interviews with 8 corporate energy managers. We asked the plant managers to respond to a variety of questions on topics such as decision-making, plant energy use, electricity and deregulation, natural gas use, energy services and outsourcing, energy efficiency, and plans for plant renovations and new construction. In our interviews with the corporate energy managers, we explored their current strategies for purchasing energy and energy services and asked them what they expect to do in the future.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{for planning and}} design of energy efficient buildings is presented and analysed. The starting point is the definition that energy efficiency {{is a question of}} minimizing the <b>energy</b> <b>end-use</b> within realistic economic frames and fully preserved function. The methodology is based on a systematic approach to the issue of energy efficiency. One element in this is the introduction of a number of energy related ratios, Energy Performance Ratios, that characterise the influence of building parts and the technical systems of the building on the <b>energy</b> <b>end-use</b> of the building as an entirety. These ratios are selected and formulated so that they facilitate a systematic strive towards high energy efficiency when applied in planning and design of buildings. One basic moment is to elucidate the energy interaction between different parts and systems of the building in order make it easier to avoid sub-optimised solutions. This is done by introducing an imaginary division of the building into, from an <b>energy</b> <b>end-use</b> point of view, characteristic system parts on different levels of interaction with other parts. The build up of the Energy Performance Ratios follows this division. Therewith the application of these ratios contributes to a comprehensive view when designing the building. Another basic moment is the setting of Energy Targets to aim at when building parts, technical systems and components are designed and rated. This is done by quantifying the Energy Performance Ratios. A substantial part of the work deals with the quantification of Energy Performance Ratios to realistic Energy Targets. This is done by a combination of analyses of existing monitored buildings and theoretical simulations and calculations. In the present work the methodology is applied primarily on design and rating of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems with a focus on commercial buildings. However, the methodology itself is not meant to be limited to these applications. The basic idea is that it should be applied on all the parts of the building that have an obvious influence on the <b>energy</b> <b>end-use...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Sequential {{or online}} {{dimensional}} reduction is of interests {{due to the}} explosion of streaming data based appli-cations and the requirement of adaptive statistical modeling, in many emerging fields, such as the modeling of <b>energy</b> <b>end-use</b> profile. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), is the classical way of dimensional reduction. However, traditional Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based PCA fails to model data which largely deviates from Gaussian distribution. The Bregman Divergence was recently introduced to achieve a generalized PCA framework. If the random variable under dimensional reduction follows Bernoulli distribution, which occurs in many emerging fields, the generalized PCA is called Logistic PCA (LPCA) [1]. In this paper, we extend the batch LPCA to a sequential version (i. e. SLPCA), based on the sequential convex optimization theory.
