5|$|Charles Y. Harvey {{began work}} on Boy with Turtle at his studio in New York City, believing that this work {{was going to be}} his masterpiece. Almost {{immediately}} he began second guessing his design and feeling that it was inadequate. This negativity was a trait that he had shown many times in the past. Roughly a week after beginning the sculpture, Harvey began hearing voices commanding him to kill himself. A paper about restoring the sculpture written at Worcester Polytechnic Institute claims the voices <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hearing</b> were coming from the partially carved sculpture itself. These voices set the date of Saturday January 27, 1912 for Harvey to kill himself. On that date he laid down his tools, headed to Bronx Park with two razors, and slit his own throat along {{the west bank of the}} Bronx River.|$|E
25|$|In 1976 Nick {{liked the}} new sounds <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hearing,</b> ranging from The Ramones in New York to The Damned in the UK. These visceral times Nick has often {{described}} as 'the best time of my life'. He was very inspired {{to get a new}} band together, and in Spring – Early Summer 1977, he began putting The Machines together. He met Bass Player Duf (Ian Duffy) via an advert in the local paper, and Drummer John Dee (née Dearlove) down the pub.|$|E
25|$|After honing their live set at Slattery's, {{they played}} two concerts, {{afternoon}} and evening, at Newbridge College on Thursday, 16 March 1972. Donovan {{was in the}} audience and invited Planxty to open for him on his six-date Irish tour the following week, during which their first major performanceat the Hangar in Galwaywas a huge success. Neither the audience nor the band knew what to expect, and both were pleasantly surprised. Irvine, unable to see the audience through {{the glare of the}} stage lights, was worried that the crowd might {{be on the verge of}} rioting. It took him several minutes to realize that what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hearing</b> was the expression of their enthusiastic response to the band's music. On 21 April 1972, Planxty embarked on their first tour of England, which had been booked previously by Moore, and played small folk clubs in Manchester, Bolton, Leeds, Hull, Barnsley, Blackpool, Newcastle, Chester and London, to great acclaim, returning to Ireland in May.|$|E

500|$|Drummond {{has said}} he was {{inspired}} by the hip-hop and scratch <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hearing</b> regularly on John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show, but looking back in 1991 he said [...] "If you listen to it now, it sounds nothing like a hip hop record, you know, it sounds a lot more like British punk... punk version of a hip hop record, I suppose." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Langford's {{death in}} May 1927, Cardus became The Manchester Guardians chief music critic. For several {{years he had}} worked closely with Langford, whose {{influence}} on the younger man was equalled only by that of Ernest Newman, Langford's predecessor as the paper's music critic: [...] "Langford taught me to feel and translate, while Newman taught me to observe and analyse". Cardus's fellow-critic Hugo Cole has described his approach as personal rather than academic, based on his own reactions to the music <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hearing,</b> and with a complete independence of judgement. Cardus was, Cole says, [...] "the last distinguished music critic never to have received formal musical training... he was a writer first, and a music critic second".|$|E
500|$|Among Waugh's {{neighbours}} in Stinchcombe was Diana Oldridge, {{known in}} the Waugh family as [...] "Tanker". She was an organiser of local music festivals, and the possessor of a contraption known as [...] "the Box". This device was reputed to cure all ills, by means of [...] "sympathetic life-waves" [...] working on some physical part of the victim—hairs, nail-clippings, or a drop of blood. Waugh himself was generally sceptical, even scornful of these powers, but some of his acquaintances {{claimed to have been}} cured by the Box, as apparently had one of Laura Waugh's cows. In letters to Laura from Cairo and Colombo, Waugh ascribed the voices <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hearing</b> {{to the power of the}} Box, and instructs Laura to tell [...] "Tanker" [...] that he now believes in it.|$|E

500|$|During {{his time}} at his {{laboratory}} Tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver which he speculated to be communications from another planet. He mentioned them {{in a letter to}} a reporter in December 1899 and to the Red Cross Society in December 1900 Reporters treated it as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion Tesla was hearing signals from Mars. He expanded on the signals he heard in a 9 February 1901 Collier's Weekly article [...] "Talking With Planets" [...] where he said it had not been immediately apparent to him that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hearing</b> [...] "intelligently controlled signals" [...] and that the signals could come from Mars, Venus, or other planets. It has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted Guglielmo Marconi's European experiments in July 1899—Marconi may have transmitted the letter S (dot/dot/dot) in a naval demonstration, the same three impulses that Tesla hinted at hearing in Colorado—or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the sons}} of Israel (Jacob) {{returned}} to Hebron from their second trip, they came back with twenty additional donkeys carrying all kinds of goods and supplies as well as Egyptian transport wagons. When their father came out to meet them, his sons told him that Joseph was still alive, {{that he was the}} governor over all of Egypt and that he wanted the house of Israel to move to Egypt. Israel’s heart “stood still” and just couldn’t believe what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hearing.</b> Looking upon the wagons he declared “Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.” (...) ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Gasolina", the album's lead single, was {{inspired}} by a Puerto Rican phrase about having a good time partying. Before the release of Barrio Fino, Daddy Yankee shared an apartment with {{his wife and three children}} in the Villa Kennedy housing project, where he occasionally heard people in the streets shouting [...] "¡Cómo le gusta la gasolina!" [...] ("How she likes gasoline!") at women who accepted rides from men with fancy cars. The hook [...] "a mí me gusta la gasolina, dame más gasolina" [...] ("I like gasoline, give me more gasoline") was born after he chanted rhythmically what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hearing</b> outside. He contacted his colleague and friend Eddie Dee to work with him on the song's lyrics.|$|E

Podgórski, who knew Kossecki before the War, can hardly believe what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>hearing</b> and reflects about the conversation he just had with Kossecki about moral accountability.|$|R

2500|$|The Cleveland Indians traded Lawton to the Pittsburgh Pirates on December 11, 2004. The Indians {{received}} pitcher Arthur Rhodes in the trade. Both teams received cash considerations {{from each}} other. Pirates general manager Dave Littlefield {{commented on the}} acquisition by saying [...] "Lawton, we think, is a good fit. With this move we've been able to help our offense". Lawton was slated to be the team's leadoff hitter after {{the departure of the}} man who hit in that position during the 2004 season, Jason Kendall. On July 14, 2005, Lawton acknowledged <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hearing</b> rumors that the Pirates were considering trading him before the July 31 no-waiver trade deadline. As a member of the Pirates that season, Lawton batted [...]273 with 53 runs scored, 102 hits, 28 doubles, one triple, 10 home runs, 44 RBIs, and 16 stolen bases in 101 games played. He also is credited with a 463-foot long home run, hit against the Colorado Rockies on May 20, 2005. To date, it is the longest by a Pirates player at PNC Park (2012).|$|E
2500|$|Kirsten {{told police}} he went to Cornell’s room at 12:15a.m., but couldn't access the locked room. He then had a {{telephone}} conversation with Vicky Cornell. [...] "I told Vicky that they wouldn’t come {{open the door and}} she told me to kick it open. I did. Upon entry, I found the bedroom door locked. I called the hotel operator and told her that I needed security to open the bedroom door. They refused again, and I told them that I’m going to damage the hotel room and (they) need to send security, call 911 and call an ambulance. I kicked the bedroom door 6-7 times before it somehow popped open. I went inside and the bathroom door was partially opened and I could see his feet." [...] Kirsten told police in a signed statement. Kirsten said that Vicky {{was on the phone with}} him the whole time asking for updates, [...] "She told me that she called the front desk and they hung up on her. It was a female. She called back a couple minutes later and a male answered, saying that it was (the first) that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hearing</b> about the incident." [...] Kirsten said in his statement that he loosened the band around Cornell's neck then tried to resuscitate him by compressing his chest. Medical personnel arrived at 12:56 a.m and tried to resuscitate the singer with no success. Cornell was pronounced dead at 1:30a.m., an hour and 15 minutes after his bodyguard was first contacted by Cornell's wife. It's unknown how long it took the bodyguard to gain entry to the hotel room and find Cornell.|$|E

6000|$|All this {{conversation}} {{went on in}} an under tone; but {{though there was a}} great deal of noise and confusion on every side, Rollo could hear it all. While he was listening to it,--or rather while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hearing</b> it, for he took no pains to listen,--the gentleman who had been talking with Mr. Waldo, and whom the latter had called Mr. Albert, went round to the two ladies who were waiting to be called, and said,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned the}} pages of the little volume, [...] "Storm and Dust," [...] glancing here and there at the broken text of reflections, maxims, short phrases, enigmatical {{sometimes}} and sometimes eloquent. It seemed to him that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hearing</b> his father's voice, speaking and ceasing to speak again. Startled at first, he ended by finding a charm in the illusion. He abandoned himself to the half-belief that something of his father dwelt yet on earth--a ghostly voice, audible to the ear of his own flesh and blood. With what strange serenity, mingled with terrors, had that man considered the universal nothingness! He had plunged into it headlong, perhaps to render death, the answer that faced one at every inquiry, more supportable.|$|E
6000|$|It was to {{the reports}} of the Sniders and the noises of the death scuffle that Jerry's head emerged from the water. A man's hand reached over a canoe-side and dragged him in by the scruff of the neck, and, {{although}} he snarled and struggled to bite his rescuer, he {{was not so much}} enraged as was he torn by the wildest solicitude for Skipper. He knew, without thinking about it, that the Arangi had been boarded by the hazily sensed supreme disaster of life that all life intuitively apprehends and that only man knows and calls by the name of [...] "death." [...] Borckman he had seen struck down. Lerumie he had heard struck down. And now <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hearing</b> the explosions of rifles and the yells and screeches of triumph and fear.|$|E
