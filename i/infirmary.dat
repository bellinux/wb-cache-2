5|$|Circumstantial {{evidence}} {{with regard}} to the location of the hospital being abutted to the church comes from several other medieval hospitals. In England, the monastic <b>infirmary</b> at Christ Church Canterbury; the <b>infirmary</b> at St Mary Chichester; St Bartholomew, Chatam and St James Dulwich are built with an <b>infirmary</b> abutting the respective chapels. The <b>infirmary</b> hall of St Mary Magdalene at Glastonbury also follows this structure.|$|E

5|$|The {{decaying}} priory {{was taken}} over by the Landmark Trust in 1969. In the subsequent 20 years restoration work was undertaken.

5|$|Another large {{building}} lies crosswise at {{the south}} end of the east range. Its lower level consists of a vaulted hall equipped with a grand thirteenth century hooded fireplace and its own garderobe. It is not clear what this chamber was used for, but it may have been the monastic infirmary—if so, it was a most unusual, perhaps unique, arrangement. Normally in a medieval Cistercian monastery an <b>infirmary</b> with its own kitchens, chapel and ancillary buildings would have been located east of the main buildings around a second, smaller cloister, but at Netley these seem to be absent. So far, excavations have not revealed whether Netley had a separate <b>infirmary</b> complex.|$|E
