40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 32 - 34). According to the Competition Act of South Africa, proposed mergers, if rejected on {{the grounds}} of anti-competitive effects as well as the efficiency considerations, may be passed on certain public interest grounds. The fourth public <b>interest</b> <b>clause</b> potentially allows mergers to be passed should the merged firm become more able to compete in international markets. This paper interprets the clause to refer to a relationship between firm size and exports, and investigates this supposed relationship and, in so doing, the validity of the clause. It is found that firm size is positively related to export propensity, the likelihood of exporting any output. However, firm size is found to be unrelated to the intensity of exporting, the proportion of output that is exported by the firm. This paper covers new areas of research, and its conclusions call into question the inclusion of the relevant public <b>interest</b> <b>clause</b> in the Competition Act...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{follows the}} idea that water {{should be used in}} the {{interest}} of the public. From a legal point of view the paper examines what the notion of ‘public interest’ actually means: it deals with the basic questions, such as how water regimes are currently structured and what role the public <b>interest</b> <b>clause</b> plays therein. It then asks which uses of water are to be considered as corresponding to the interests of the public; how competing interests are to be balanced against each other; and how particularly vulnerable interests of individual water users and environmental protection of waters can be attributed the status of paramount public interests. The paper is structured in two parts: the first explains the water law of two countries, Switzerland and South Africa, in which the public <b>interest</b> <b>clause</b> plays a key role in water distribution. In its second part, the paper introduces the human right to water in international, Swiss and South African law. It then points out the shortcomings of the human right to water (in relation to each of the three legal orders) if employed as a protective shield for basic water supply requirements in decisions on water distribution under the public <b>interest</b> <b>clause.</b> The paper concludes by stressing the need to evolve the legal protection of basic human needs because the human right to water — as conceived in international law, Swiss law and South African law — does not always meet the requirements to fully exercise its protective function...|$|E

C. C. The Article identifies the various factors that courts will consider to determine the issue, including (1) {{the subject matter of}} the additional term; (2) the test adopted for determining materiality; (3) the conduct of the parties; (4) the presence of course of dealing evidence; and (5) the language of comments four to U.

Moreover, the Article focuses on six types of clauses that frequently appear as additional terms in acceptance and confirmation documents, including (1) arbitration; (2) disclaimer of warranties; (3) limitation of remedies, including consequential damages; (4) forum selection; (5) attorney fees; and (6) pre-judgment interest upon a buyer’s default. Through the extensive survey, Professor Davis concludes that, except for forum selection and pre-judgment <b>interest</b> <b>clauses,</b> courts tend to look at these issues on a case-by-case basis to determine whether or not additional terms materially alter a contract...|$|R
40|$|This article {{concentrates}} on certain consumer protection issues in Estonian and Norwegian law in proceedings for {{the enforcement of}} security rights in residential immovable property.

The authors conclude that no legislative amendments are currently required in either of the two countries: the Estonian and Norwegian rules on acceleration and default <b>interest</b> <b>clauses,</b> as well as on enforcement proceedings, seem to be well in line with the requirements set by Azizand by the MCD.

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{examined}} the experimental and analytic bases for understanding the performance {{of each of the}} weapon types that are currently planned to remain in the US enduring nuclear stockpile. They have also examined whether continued underground tests at various nuclear yield thresholds would add significantly to the confidence in this stockpile in the years ahead. The starting point for this examination was a detailed review of past experience in developing and testing modern nuclear weapons, their certification and recertification processes, their performance margins, and evidence of aging or other trends over time for each weapon type in the enduring stockpile. The findings, as summarized in Conclusions 1 through 6, are consistent with US agreement to enter into a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) of unending duration, that includes a standard ``supreme national interest`` clause. Recognizing that the challenge of maintaining an effective nuclear stockpile for an indefinite period without benefit of underground tests is an important and also a new one, the US should affirm its readiness to invoke the supreme national <b>interest</b> <b>clause</b> should the need arise as a result of unanticipated technical problems in the enduring stockpile...|$|E
40|$|Compound {{interest}} {{is a concept}} that, historically, has been tainted with an essentially mercantile flavour. It relates to the custom of banks in capitalising on the interest due by a client upon the expiry of a certain interval (the rest). Such practice, zealously vilified in some quarters whilst acclaimed as a prosperous enterprise in others, has been challenged more recently, at both judicial level and under statute, {{in the case of}} Italy. This contribution, in briefly recalling the origin of the concept of anatocism (the orthodox definition of compound interest) and, therefore, its Roman predecessor, the usurarum usurae and the futurarum usurarum usurarae (usurae), seeks to examine the state-of-the-art apparatus applicable to compound interest in the British common law. Such deliberations will thereupon give rise to what this paper aspires to describe as a peculiar development. In this respect, attention is drawn to the recent Consumer Rights Act 2015 {{and the manner in which}} the bank customer is theoretically entitled to rely upon it, with specific reference to the compound <b>interest</b> <b>clause.</b> As regards the 'Continental experience', the Italian jurisdiction, awash with judicial twists and incandescent doctrinal views on this topic, is discussed and analysed as a compelling and stimulating comparator...|$|E
40|$|This article aims {{to restart}} the debate on trade {{remedies}} by offering new perspectives on the fundamental defects of the current trade remedy regime and by proposing a bold yet feasible roadmap for reforms. This article focuses on antidumping, the linchpin of trade remedies. While antidumping is being justified as a safety valve for protectionist pressures, I argue in this article that antidumping is a faulty safety valve in that it provides arbitrary levels of protection for petitioners, results in undue uncertainties for respondents, and has too low a threshold for activation. I further demonstrate that antidumping exacerbates democracy deficit in trade policy, as the mechanical formulas used for calculating antidumping duties deprive the trade remedy process of the democratic participation that is essential for seeking consensus and compromises on trade protectionism. I propose to replace antidumping with a new country-specific safeguard that has a heightened injury standard and a mandatory public <b>interest</b> <b>clause.</b> I argue that this country-specific safeguard comports with the policy objectives of trade remedies and is politically feasible. The global safeguard currently in use, by contrast, cannot {{provide the kind of}} trade protection demanded by users of antidumping. Finally, I argue that once the country-specific safeguard is adopted, countervailing duties should be subsumed under the country-specific safeguard as well...|$|E

40|$|LL. M. (Banking Law) The {{charging}} {{of interest}} and the variation thereof throughout the term of a credit agreement has, in a modern South Africa, become the rule rather than the exception. This is so because in a constant evolving economy {{it will not be}} viable for large financial institutions to commit themselves to fixed interest rates especially where a credit agreement such as a mortgage agreement may extend over many years. With this comes the question as to the extent of a credit provider’s discretion to vary interest rates {{and the manner in which}} it purports to do so. Naturally where the National Credit Act finds application in respect of a credit agreement the provisions thereof relating to interest and the variation thereof will determine whether a clause allowing a credit provider to vary the interest rate unilaterally is valid and enforceable. However in instances where the National Credit Act is not applicable to a certain credit agreement, especially in the case where the consumer is a juristic person, the interest rate levied and the variation thereof will fall to be decided in terms of the common law. The application of the common law in this regard is not without difficulty and there have been many conflicting decisions of our courts in this regard. Whilst the supreme court of appeal has finally decided on the matter of discretionary <b>interest</b> rate <b>clauses</b> it is no doubt that this issue will surface for many years to come. This dissertation explains the comparative positions of interest rate and variable <b>interest</b> rate <b>clauses</b> in terms of the National Credit Act and the common law...|$|R

40|$|The legal norms {{governing}} {{the distribution of}} water are integral to how access to water is determined. This paper analyses the idea that water {{should be used in}} the interest of the public from a legal point of view. Taking Swiss and South African law as examples it examines what the notion of 'public interest' actually means. A close look at the notion of 'water distribution in the public interest' reveals important insights: water distribution in the public interest balances a variety of different economic, ecological and social interests. In this process the human right to water is attributed the role as protective shield. Hence its effective implementation is crucial in order to safeguard water for basic human needs. After analysing how Swiss and South African water regimes are currently structured and the role of the public <b>interest</b> <b>clause</b> therein, the paper examines whether the human right to water as conceived in Swiss, South African and international law effectively ensures protection of domestic water users. The paper concludes that this is the case under some, but not all circumstances. Especially the interests of those users whose access to water is not yet sufficient do not always receive adequate legal protection by the respective legal orders. The paper concludes by stressing the necessity to evolve the concept of the human right to water to reach comprehensive protection of basic human needs. Consciousness of the social risks associated with using the human right to water as general placeholder for basic human needs despite its shortcomings will hopefully encourage efforts to establish substantive legal protection...|$|E
40|$|In {{the wake}} of its 2001 {{economic}} crisis, Argentina implemented a series of emergency measures. These measures - terminating the peso's peg to the U. S. dollar and freezing the gas tariff adjustment mechanism - seriously impaired the foreign investment, which had been lured to Argentina by the privatization of the gas industry, and other government measures promoting foreign investment in the 1990 s. Injured foreign investors sought compensation through arbitration and filed claims for damages against the Republic of Argentina by referring to the relevant provisions under the bilateral investment treaties (BITs) between their respective home countries and Argentina. In the series of arbitration cases, Argentina sought to justify the emergency steps it had taken {{in response to the}} economic crisis by invoking the doctrine of state of necessity under customary international law and the security <b>interest</b> <b>clause</b> under the relevant BIT. Arbitral tribunals were split in their decisions on such claims. Some tribunals dismissed them, while others accepted or suggested the possibility of accepting Argentina's defenses. The tribunals were inconsistent with one another both in interpretation of law and evaluation of the facts with respect to the relationship between customary international law and BITs, the seriousness of the crisis, {{the degree to which the}} Argentine government contributed to the crisis, and the existence of a state of necessity to justify the emergency measures taken by Argentina. Such confusion among arbitration decisions is attributable to the fact that the quoted exception/exemption provisions are extremely generally termed, and that these provisions are, in principle, intended for situations constituting grave and imminent peril in political or military terms and do not necessarily apply in the case of economic difficulties. As evidenced by the series of Argentine cases, such shortcomings of the aforesaid general exception/exemption provisions as an economic safeguard clause could discourage host countries from making significant commitments in investment treaties and, contrary to the intended purpose of such treaties, undermine the predictability of the investment environment. Furthermore, the legitimacy of the arbitral tribunals interpreting and applying the exception/exemption provisions - or even the entire investment arbitration system - could be seriously undermined. In order to solve these problems, future investment treaties should include an economic safeguard clause that is viable in light of the recognition that an investment treaty plays a crucial role in protecting investments, particularly in developing countries whose economic bases remain vulnerable. Such a clause has already been included in the draft text of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) negotiated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, as well as in some progressive and recent BITs. However, it is necessary to create a more comprehensive institutional mechanism capable of efficiently responding to economic crises by taking into consideration the implications of the Argentine incidents, as well as trade remedies under international trade law. ...|$|E
40|$|The 1976 {{amendments}} to the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) were primarily aimed at enabling the statute to better accommodate the demands placed on coastal resources {{by an increase in}} domestic energy exploration and production. The national interest provision (Section 306 (c) (8) confronts the problem of potential conflicts arising out of the pursuit of equally important coastal zone management goals as stated in the CZMA. The CZMA states that there is a national interest in the 2 ̆ 2 effective management, beneficial use, protection and development of the Coastal Zone 2 ̆ 2. Due to the increasing likelihood of more energy facility sittings in the coastal zone Congress {{wanted to make sure that}} 2 ̆ 2 adequate consideration 2 ̆ 2 was given to energy facility siting proposals. The national interest provision and attendant federal regulations are designed to ensure that each federally approved coastal zone management program treats such proposals in a comprehensive fashion. Congress 2 ̆ 7 wording of the national interest provision is the cause of much controversy. 2 ̆ 2 Adequate consideration 2 ̆ 2 is subject to various interpretations by state and federal officials and private industry. Chapter I reviews the CZMA 2 ̆ 7 s legislative history, court proceedings, state and federal records and private industry comments to display the complexity involved in interpreting the national interest provision. Chapter II evaluates how well Massachusetts and Rhode Island coastal zone management programs comply with the national <b>interest</b> <b>clause.</b> Both states compliance procedures are subject to question as there have not been any specific cases involving the national interest to this date. Massachusetts and Rhode Island 2 ̆ 7 s programs are ambiguous with regard to how final decisions on national interest facility sittings are made. Chapter III presents findings and conclusions with regard to Massachusetts and Rhode Island 2 ̆ 7 s compliance with the national interest provision. Program recommendations are made pursuant to the goals as stated by Congress in the CZMA. The major finding in both states is that there is a lack of adequate national interest assessment criteria. Decision makers presently review federal and private industry impact assessments, however, they have nothing to base their evaluations on. It is advocated here that a facility should be subject to national interest scrutiny, whenever a NEPA assessment is required. After such designation, federally promulgated national interest assessment guidelines should be available for state and local decision makers. Such standards will unify each state 2 ̆ 7 s approach to national interest facility siting and ensure equal treatment of project proposals. Specifically, Massachusetts should provide for better consideration of national interest facilities valued at less than five million dollars. Presently, the Energy Facility Siting Council is responsible for fulfilling the national interest provision, but is not legally bound to do so. Measures should be taken to depoliticize the national interest process in Massachusetts. Rhode Island does not have an energy facility siting body and is in need of an adequate energy facility planning process. The Coastal Resources Management Council is the best mechanism available for implementing this planning process. Rhode Island also needs a stronger regulatory mechanism to ensure that the regional benefit clause of the CZMA is not ignored. Non-compliance with the regional benefit clause could undermine the effects of the national interest provision. An energy facility siting process similar to Massachusetts Energy Facility Siting Council would ensure such compliance. Lastly, regional consideration of national interest proposals is advocated in an effort to improve upon the comprehensive approach now attempted in considering the national interest...|$|E
50|$|Differently {{from most}} {{countries}} in the region (including Western Balkan countries), defamation in Slovenia remains a criminal offense possibly leading to prison terms. Journalists can also be legally compelled to reveal their sources. Publishing classified information is a criminal offense too, since the new 2008 Penal Code.

40|$|As medidas {{antidumping}} são uma exceção ao livre comércio e como tal deveriam ser usadas com restrição. No entanto, desde o GATT 1947 há preocupação com o uso abusivo de tais medidas, podendo ser o mecanismo utilizado não apenas para possibilitar a recuperação da indústria doméstica prejudicada pelas importações objeto de dumping, objetivo do Acordo Antidumping (AAD), mas com o fim de proteger a indústria nacional da concorrência estrangeira. Desta forma, o objetivo do presente trabalho é apresentar as principais características do AAD firmado ao final da Rodada Uruguai que culminou na constituição da Organização Mundial do Comércio (OMC), incluindo seus antecedentes históricos e a possibilidade de aplicação discricionária, demonstrando como uma norma surgida no plano internacional em decorrência de um acordo multilateral vem sendo utilizada pelo Brasil, com a finalidade de se demonstrar a possibilidade de uso das medidas antidumping como barreira à entrada no mercado brasileiro. Confirmada a possibilidade de uso abusivo desse instrumento de defesa comercial, ainda que no plano teórico, uma vez que não é possível analisar os efeitos reais das medidas aplicadas, serão apresentadas as formas de contrabalanço ao protecionismo atualmente existentes no próprio AAD e sua incorporação e utilização pelo Brasil bem como a possibilidade de questionamento de tais medidas como práticas anticompetitivas com fundamento na legislação antitruste perante as autoridades de defesa da concorrência. Serão ainda analisadas outras possibilidades de contrabalanço ao uso exacerbado das medidas antidumping em debate e viabilidade das mesmas no cenário atual em que se verifica, de um lado, o aumento de uso de tais medidas pelos países Membros da OMC, destacando-se o Brasil e, de outro lado, impasse nas negociações multilaterais, cabendo aos Membros tomarem decisões unilaterais sobre a aplicação de tais medidas, seu grau de intensidade e forma de aplicação a depender da proteção que se pretende garantir à indústria nacional. Antidumping {{measures are}} {{an exception to}} the free trade and as such they should be used with restrictions. However, since GATT 1947 there is a concern regarding the abuse in the use of such measures, being possible the use of the instrument not only to make possible the recovery of the domestic industry that was injured by the dumped imports, purpose of the Antidumping Agreement (ADA), but also with the purpose of protecting the domestic industry of the foreign competition. Thus, the purpose of this Masters Thesis is to present the main aspects of the ADA signed {{as a result of the}} Uruguay Round, that led to the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including its historical background and the possibility of discretionary application, being demonstrated how a rule emerged in an international level as part of a multilateral agreement has been used by Brazil. The purpose is to demonstrate the possibility of the use of the antidumping measures as a barrier to entry in the Brazilian market. Being confirmed the possibility of the abusive use of this trade defense instrument, even if only in theory, since it is not possible to analyze the actual impacts of the applied measures, it will be present the possibilities to counterbalance the protectionism that are established in the ADA, namely the public <b>interest</b> <b>clause</b> and the lesser duty rule, and their adoption and use by Brazil and possibility of challenging such measures as anticompetitive practices based on the antitrust law before the Brazilian Antitrust Authority. Additional possibilities under debate and their feasibility to counterbalance the abuse in the use of the antidumping measures will also be analyzed in the actual scenario where, on one hand, there is the increase of such measures by WTO Members in general and mainly Brazil and, on the other hand, there is an impasse in the multilateral negotiations. The Members will have to unilaterally decide on the implementation of such measures, the level of its intensity and form of application depending on the intended protection to ensure the domestic industry...|$|E

To achieve this, we identify the properties related with information ex-change between parties, and we group the properties of <b>interest</b> into typed <b>clauses.</b> We then propose that interfaces can be built using shared typed clauses. If the interfaces between parties are compatible, the cou-pling of the interfaces can yield a coupling contract. The clauses belong-ing to the contract represent what information can be shared between the parties, and the type of the clause specifies how this information will be shared. Finally, we show how the deployment of applications on the Grid can benefit from the proposed approach. Unfamiliar applications can couple with deployment descriptors to deploy on alien Grids, without modifying or inspecting neither of them. ...|$|R

E-contraction is applicable in yet weaker systems where there may be no notion of negation (such as in definite clauses). I-contraction on the other hand has severe limitations, which makes it of limited use as a belief change operator.

More than two-thirds of all private loans granted by Austrian banks provide for variable interest rates and are thus subject to fluctuation mechanisms which need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Consumer Protection Act. Most of the private adjustable-rate loans granted by banks since 1997 include an <b>interest</b> rate adjustment <b>clause</b> according to which any change in the interest rate needs {{to be based on the}} arithmetic mean from the Vienna Interbank Offered Rate for three-month funds or (as of the start of Monetary Union) the Euro Interbank Offered Rate for three-month funds and the secondary market yield for federal bonds. Empirical evidence obtained from simple correlation and regression analyses supports the assumption that the standard rate covenant fully complies with the relevant criteria of the Consumer Protection Act ("factual justification" or "independence from the entrepreneur's will"). The change of the average obtained from the two interest indicators reflects to a high degree the development of average refinancing costs by the Austrian banks since the mid 1990 s (for database reasons, a comparison with the period before 1995 is not possible). An attractive and relatively simple theoretical approach to justifying the standard rate clause is provided by interpreting it as a rule for sharing macroeconomically caused interest rate risks. Assuming approximately risk-neutral banks, this adjustment mechanism warrants that the non-diversifiable macroeconomic risk of a change in the interest rate is optimally spread between approximately risk-neutral borrowers and investors. In the given context of the model, an optimal situation for all players involved is obtained when banks on balance carry no risk, whereas the borrower and investor share the macro-economic risk of a change in the interest rate at equal parts. Near-risk-neutral banks carry the macroeconomic risk of a change in the interest rate (at 50 percent) only when the borrower and investor belong to different risk preference categories (e. g., the borrower is averse to risk and the investor is more or less risk-neutral, or vice versa).

6000|$|... (c) There {{remains a}} third {{provision}} more sweeping {{than either of}} the above, neither of which affects German interests in neutral countries. The Reparation Commission is empowered up to May 1, 1921, to demand payment up to $5,000,000,000 in such manner as they may fix, [...] "whether in gold, commodities, ships, securities or otherwise."[28] This provision {{has the effect of}} intrusting to the Reparation Commission for the period in question dictatorial powers over all German property of every description whatever. They can, under this Article, point to any specific business, enterprise, or property, whether within or outside Germany, and demand its surrender; and their authority would appear to extend not only to property existing at the date of the Peace, but also to any which may be created or acquired {{at any time in the}} course of the next eighteen months. For example, they could pick out--as presumably they will as soon as they are established--the fine and powerful German enterprise in South America known as the Deutsche Ueberseeische Elektrizitätsgesellschaft (the D.U.E.G.), and dispose of it to Allied <b>interests.</b> The <b>clause</b> is unequivocal and all-embracing. It is worth while to note in passing that it introduces a quite novel principle in the collection of indemnities. Hitherto, a sum has been fixed, and the nation mulcted has been left free to devise and select for itself the means of payment. But in this case the payees can (for a certain period) not only demand a certain sum but specify the particular kind of property in which payment is to be effected. Thus the powers of the Reparation Commission, with which I deal more particularly in the next chapter, can be employed to destroy Germany's commercial and economic organization as well as to exact payment.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{is focused on}} reinsurance. Most simply, reinsurance {{can be described as}} insurance of insurance portfolios written by insurers. In our research, two aspects which are of importance in the daily practice of reinsurance will be considered. The combination of two reinsurance methods will be considered, by which will be looked for, {{on the basis of the}} “main-variance” principle, how the two methods can be combined in an optimal way in order to minimalize the extra reinsurance cost above the expected reinsurance recovery for a given retained volatility. Assuming that the supplementary reinsurance cost is proportional with the expected reinsurance recovery, where this proportionality factor changes according to the reinsurance method and the volatility is measured on basis of the variance. Combinations of the following reinsurance methods are taken into consideration : quota share (a fixed percentage for all risks are ceded proportionally to the reinsurance market), surplus (each risk is proportionally ceded by which the percentage per risk is determined by the exposure (ie the insured value) which exceeds a certain amount), excess of loss (the portion of each loss exceeding a certain amount is paid by the reinsurance market), and stop loss (the portion of the annual loss exceeding a certain amount is paid by the reinsurance market). The most important conclusions we obtain are that the optimal combination does not change when we modify all proportionality factors of the margins with the same factor. Further, we believe that the order of application of a quota share with an excess of loss (or a stop loss) effectively and a surplus have their importance. Another topic of the daily reinsurance practice is the benchmarking of commercial premium rates of excess of loss contracts which protect a motorcar third party liability insurance portfolio, without the use of loss statistics. Here we consider that the commercial premiums can be described as the expected value of a compound process by which the loss distribution is a Burr or Pareto distribution. Within the (mixed) generalized non-linear regression models the parameters are estimated on basis of the observed premium rates (premium relative to premium income of the insurance portfolio). Those estimations take into account the impact of the typical reinsurance clauses such as stability clause (determination of the loss inflation per loss and distribution hereof between both parties), <b>interest</b> sharing <b>clause</b> (distribution of the loss interest between both parties), deposit clause (determination of the financial revenues of the loss reserves) and the influence of the payment pattern. By using mixed models the parameters are individualized per insurer. The important result we become is that the reinsurance premiums can be estimated for alternatives by which clauses and/or excess of loss covers change, as well for the individual insurers as for homogeneous groups. nrpages: 124 status: publishe...|$|R
2500|$|The third kind of remedy, for {{unauthorised}} gains, is restitution. In Murad v Al Saraj the Murad sisters {{entered a}} joint venture (creating a fiduciary relation, like for trustees) with Mr Al Saraj to buy a hotel. He deceitfully told them he was investing all his own money, when in fact he set off a debt from the seller and took an undisclosed commission. When sued {{to give up the}} profits he made, he submitted that the sisters would have entered the transaction even if they had known what he had done. Arden LJ rejected this argument, affirming that upon such a wrong, it was not open for the fiduciary to argue what might, hypothetically, have happened. A reduction in liability could only come from a determination of the value of skill and effort contributed. This is less generously quantified for dishonest fiduciaries, but generous allowances are typically given, as in Boardman v Phipps for fiduciaries who all along act honestly. Trustees who are found to commit wrongs may also have a defence under the Trustee Act 1925 sections 61–62. This gives courts discretion to relieve liability for people who acted [...] "honestly and reasonably, and ought fairly to be excused". There may also be exclusion clauses in the trust deed, up to the point of removing liability for fraud and open conflicts of <b>interest.</b> Chiefly exclusion <b>clauses</b> will erase liability for breaches of the duty of care, although for professional trustees the ability to do this is constrained by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. If agreements for money management take place through contracts, a professional trustee probably cannot exclude liability for breach of contract under section 3, because given that he would be better placed to take out insurance liability exclusion will probably not be reasonable under section 11. Lastly, the Limitation Act 1980 sections 21–22 prevents claims for innocent or negligent trust breach being pursued six years after the right of action accrues, again with the exception for fraud or property converted by trustees for their own use, where there is no limit.|$|R

Kao posebno pitanje otvara se ono o odnosu ugovorne kazne i prekršajne globe. Razganičuju se ugovorna kazna i srodne klauzule te se uočavaju poteškoće koje se pri tome pojavljuju. Na temelju srodnosti ugovorne kazne i spomenutih klauzula zauzimaju se stajališta o primjeni odredaba ZOO-a koje se tiču ugovorne kazne na klazule srodne ugovornoj kazni. Ispituje se pravnopolitička pozadina čl. 350. st. 1. ZOO koji određuje ugovornu kaznu i čl. 353. ZOO o smanjenju pretjerano visoke ugovorne kazne. Ocjenjuje se je li de lege ferenda potrebno mijenjati odredbu čl. 274. ZOO tako da se područje njezine primjene proširi na sve ugovorne klauzule. The author {{discusses}} {{the relationship between}} the accessory contractual punishment and independent contractual punishment, guarantee, earnest money, desist money, cassatory <b>clause,</b> membership punishment, <b>interest</b> rate, price, <b>clause</b> of exclusion and limitation of damage liability. The relation between the contractual punishment and fine is treated as a special issue. Contractual punishment and related clauses are demarcated and difficulties that can emerge in the process are considered. Based on the relatedness of contractual punishment and the above clauses, views are expressed on the application of the Law on Obligatory Relations concerning the contractual punishment to clauses related to contractual punishment. The legal and political background of the Article 350 paragraph 1 of the Law on Obligatory Relations defining the contractual punishment is examined, as well as the Article 353 of the Law on Obligatory Relations on the reduction of an excessive contractual punishment. It is examined whether it is necessary de lege ferrenda to change the regulation of the Article 274 of the Law on Obligatory Relations so that the area of its application can be widened to all the contractual clauses. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird das Verhältnis zwischen der akzessorischen Vertragsstrafe und der eigenständigen Vertragsstrafe, Garantie, Angeld, Reugeld, kassatorischer Klausel, Vereinsstrafe, Zinsen, Preis, Hauftungsausschluss- und -beschränkungsklauseln erörtert. Als besondere Frage wird das Verhältnis zwischen Vertragsstrafe und Bußgeld für Ordnungswidrigkeiten thematisiert. Vertragsstrafe und verwandte Klauseln werden voneinander abgegrenzt und die dabei entstehenden Schwierigkeiten festgestellt. Auf Grund der ähnlichen Bedeutung der Vertragsstrafe und der angeführten Klauseln wird die Anwendung der Bestimmungen des Obligationengesetzes (OG) zur Vertragsstrafe auf der Vertragsstrafe nahestehende Klauseln erwogen. Es wird der rechtspolitische Hintergrund von § 350 Abs. 1 OG, der die Vertragsstrafe regelt, und § 353 OG, in dem übermäßige Vertragstrafen gemindert werden, untersucht. Es wird beurteilt, ob es de lege ferrenda erforderlich ist, die Bestimmung des § 274 OG insofern zu ändern, dass ihr Anwendungsbereich auf alle Vertragsklauseln ausgedehnt wird...|$|R
