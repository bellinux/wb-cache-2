South of Juby comes historic Cape Bojador, the 'Gorbellied,' and Cabo Blanco, which is to northern what Cabo Negro is to southern Africa.

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{urbanization}} rate and extreme rainfall {{as a form of}} the abnormal climate, the urban <b>flood</b> frequency has been increased. Therefore, it is very important for the policy makers to evaluate the urban <b>flood</b> vulnerability and propose the corresponding <b>flood</b> mit-igation policies. Since the interests on the urban <b>flood</b> mitigation is increased, many structural <b>flood</b> measures has been constructed. If a city has many structural <b>flood</b> measures, the city is considered as the <b>flood</b> safe city. In this study, inherent <b>flood</b> vulnerability is pro-posed using <b>Flood</b> Protection Capacity and Damage(PCD) matrix with the <b>flood</b> damage cost and constructed structural <b>flood</b> mit-igation measures. The proposed inherent <b>flood</b> vulnerability method was applied in Seoul. The results are categorized by four areas such as relatively <b>flood</b> safe area, <b>flood</b> risk area, inherent <b>flood</b> vulnerable area, and the area where more structural <b>flood</b> measures are needed. Calculated inherent <b>flood</b> vulnerabilities were compared to the conventional <b>flood</b> vulnerability-resilience indices. The proposed inherent <b>flood</b> vulnerability showed more reasonable results. For example, Songpa and Mapo were considered as the <b>flood</b> safe districts because of its high financial independence rate and many constructed <b>flood</b> mitigation measures. However, their inherent <b>flood</b> vulnerability is relatively high. There results could show the comprehensive aspect on the <b>flood</b> mitigation policies...|$|R

40|$|Mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a self-deliberate data network, {{where all}} nodes behave like host or router. MANET is a {{collection}} of number of mobile nodes or devices that randomly generate a temporary network. Security is the fundamental requirement in MANET due to its behavior of changing topology, open medium and lack of centralized authentication. This leads to various security attacks in mobile ad hoc network and violate the criteria of routing mechanism. Mobile Ad-hoc network doesn’t need backbone infrastructure support and it is very reliable and also contains the routable networking environment.

30|$|Geo-networking packets not {{destined for}} the SWRP element are passed to the DecIP 6 HLIM element, which reduces the value in the IPv 6 Hop Limit field by one. In contradiction to the similar element in the {{standard}} IPv 6 section of the Click configuration, there is no connection to an element that sends ICMP 6 error messages to the source network interface. On the VANET, such functionality would cause unnecessary capacity waste. The next element in the forwarding chain is the Simple <b>flooder</b> element. It maintains {{a list of all}} packets that it recently forwarded. As described in the “Interpretation of IPv 6 header parameters” section, the triplet source address, destination address, and flow label are used to uniquely identify each packet. If the Simple <b>flooder</b> element receives a packet that is already included in its list, then the packet is destroyed. Else the corresponding ID is added to the list, and the packet is passed to the next element: the Multicast Tee. This element does nothing more then duplicating a message received on its input to all its outputs. This means that a copy of the geo-networking packet is forwarded to the Linux networking stack of the host, the intra-station LAN and WLAN, and the VANET interface. The check paint elements on the outgoing connections of the Multicast Tee make sure that the packet is not forwarded to the router input from which it originated (host, LAN, or WLAN). On the VANET interface such an inspection is not foreseen since in this context message relaying requires that packets can be forwarded on the same network interface as the one that they were received on. Before the packets are put in the outgoing queue of each network interface, the appropriate MAC headers are placed in front of the IPv 6 geo-networking packet. This is carried out by the different multicast elements. In case of intra-station multicasting, the applied addresses correspond with the scheme described in the “Routing methodology” section. In case of VANET traffic, the destination MAC address always is the broadcast address FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. On the VANET, a last check is also performed before handing the packet over to the VANET interface. The value of the Flow Label field is inspected, if no value has been set and the packet originated from this ITS station, the field is updated with the appropriate value.|$|E

A non-parametric, multivariate, empirical, orthogonal function matrix model, which consists of time correlation coefficients of <b>flood</b> discharge at different gauge stations and <b>flood</b> events {{was used for the}} analysis of <b>flood</b> frequency. The model addresses the characteristics of confluent <b>floods</b> such as frequency and the probability in multiple tributary rivers. <b>Flood</b> frequency analysis is often coupled with studies of hydrological routing processes that reduce the <b>flood</b> capacity of the rivers. <b>Flood</b> routing to the confluence were simulated using kinematic wave theory. Results of this <b>flood</b> frequency analysis showed that <b>flooding</b> frequency has intensified in the past 500 years, especially during the 19 th century. <b>Flooding</b> in streams above the confluence was more frequent than in streams below the confluence. Over the last 2000 years, concurrent <b>flooding</b> in multiple tributary rivers accounted for 67. 5 % of the total <b>flooding</b> in the middle Yellow River. Simulation of <b>flood</b> routing processes shows that the decreased <b>flooding</b> capacity and elevated river bed of the shrunken main channel leads to an increased <b>flood</b> wave propagation time (24 – 52. 3 h) in the study area after 1995.
