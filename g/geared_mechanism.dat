25|$|There were {{probably}} {{several types of}} south-pointing chariot which worked differently. In {{most or all of}} them, the rotating road wheels mechanically operated a <b>geared</b> <b>mechanism</b> to keep the pointer aimed correctly. The mechanism had no magnets and did not automatically detect which direction was south. The pointer was aimed southward by hand {{at the start of a}} journey. Subsequently, whenever the chariot turned, the mechanism rotated the pointer relative to the body of the chariot to counteract the turn and keep the pointer aiming in a constant direction, to the south. Thus the mechanism did a kind of directional dead reckoning, which is inherently prone to cumulative errors and uncertainties. Some chariots' mechanisms may have had differential gears. If so, it was probably the first use of differentials anywhere in the world.|$|E

Lower Kyme lock was refurbished in the winter of 2008. The upper gate is a vertical guillotine gate, and the mechanism required 350 turns of a handle to raise the gate, and another 350 to lower it again. New lock gates were fitted, and a new <b>geared</b> <b>mechanism</b> requiring fewer turns made the lock easier to operate. Around [...] of the waterway from Sleaford to Cogglesford Mill lock were reopened, following the construction of a lifting bridge in the town centre. This was installed in late December 2008, although the hydraulic operating gear was not fitted until January 2010. Work was also carried out to construct a new slipway on Eastgate Green, to allow trailed boats to be launched onto the town section. This involved careful planning to avoid damage to 27 mature trees, and the widening of [...] of the bank to create a mooring point. Funding was provided by Lincolnshire County Council, the Inland Waterways Association, and Waste Recycling Environmental Ltd (WREN), which administers the Landfill Communities Fund. An official opening of the new bridge and facilities took place on 3 July 2010, when three boats were launched from the slipway. Members from canoe clubs at Boston and Sleaford attended.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Central {{differential}} is a <b>geared</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{located between}} the two driving axles thereby providing torque developed by engine in required ratio to both the axle. In ordinary four wheel drive vehicle, there are two differentials one in rear axle and other in front axle along with a transfer gear box in between, which converts it to four wheel drive. A four wheel drive vehicle without a central differential cannot be driven on dry, paved roads in four-wheel drive mode, as small differences in rotational speed between {{the front and rear}} wheels produces extra torque to be applied across the transmission. This phenomenon is known as "wind-up", and can cause considerable damage to the transmission or drive train. But in all wheel drive vehicle transfer gear box is replaced by central differential that transmit the power for all whee...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Antikythera mechanism, dateable {{around to}} the first century BC, is the oldest known <b>geared</b> <b>mechanism</b> treated as an astronomical {{computer}} through the decoding of modern technology. In accordance with the decoded exterior dials and their functions, the interior mech-anism was confirmed to consist of five corresponding subsystems. However, some unexplained problems still exist among these subsystems, such as the lunar subsystem, in which the visible pentagonal mark is positioned on the centre of a gear, demonstrating the lunar anomaly motion. From the viewpoint of mechanical design, this strange evidence implies {{the existence of a}} shaft with a complex structure, i. e. the coaxial gears with different rates. Also, it affects strongly the identifications of links and even the positions of gears. In order to provide other possible concepts to clarify this problem, this study synthesizes all feasible reconstruction designs through a systematic procedure. Through the study of historical literature, astronomical theories and existing designs, design constraints which are indispensible for the assignments of links and joints are concluded. Then, according to the concepts of generalization and specialization of mechanism, 13 feasible designs which are consistent with the theories and techniques of the subject’s time period, including the one by Freeth et al. are synthesized. Once new discoveries about the unexplained problem appear in the future, these feasible designs can be the corresponding answer...|$|E
