The spectral index maps show trends in agreement with general expectations [...] flat core and steep jets [...] while the actual value of the spectral index for jets shows indications for a dependence on AGN type. We analyzed the kinematics of jet components of BL Lac and 3 C 111, detecting superluminal proper motions with maximum apparent speeds of about 5 c.

The detailed analysis presented here {{indicates that the}} spectral luminosity of the central spine of the jet in M 87 is a few percent of that of the surrounding hollow jet 200 - 400 μas from the central black hole. Furthermore, recent jet models in indicate that a hollow "tubular" jet can explain {{a wide range of}} plausible broadband spectra originating from jetted plasma located within ∼ 30 μas of the central black hole, including the 230 GHz correlated flux detected by the Event Horizon Telescope. Most importantly, these hollow jets from the inner accretion flow have an intrinsic power capable of energizing the <b>global</b> <b>jet</b> out to kiloparsec scales. Thus motivated, this paper considers new models of the event horizon magnetosphere (EHM) in low luminosity accretion systems. Contrary to some models, the spine is not an invisible powerful jet. It is an intrinsically weak jet. In the new EHM solution, the accreted poloidal magnetic flux is weak and the background photon field is weak. It is shown how this accretion scenario naturally results in the dissipation of the accreted poloidal magnetic flux in the EHM not the accumulation of poloidal flux required for a powerful jet. The new solution indicates less large scale poloidal magnetic flux (and jet power) in the EHM than in the surrounding accretion flow and cannot support significant EHM driven jets.
