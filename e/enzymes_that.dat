5|$|<b>Enzymes</b> <b>that</b> {{require a}} {{cofactor}} {{but do not}} have one bound are called apoenzymes or apoproteins. An enzyme together with the cofactor(s) required for activity is called a holoenzyme (or haloenzyme). The term holoenzyme can also be applied to <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> contain multiple protein subunits, such as the DNA polymerases; here the holoenzyme is the complete complex containing all the subunits needed for activity.|$|E
5|$|An enzyme's name {{is often}} derived from its {{substrate}} or the chemical reaction it catalyzes, {{with the word}} ending in -ase. Examples are lactase, alcohol dehydrogenase and DNA polymerase. Different <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> catalyze the same chemical reaction are called isozymes.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{frequently}} secrete chemicals {{into their}} environment {{in order to}} modify it favourably. The secretions are often proteins and may act as <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> digest some form of food in the environment.|$|E

50|$|Dihydrolipoamide {{dehydrogenase}} (DLD), {{also known}} as dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, mitochondrial, is an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> in humans is encoded by the DLD gene. DLD is a flavoprotein <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> oxidizes dihydrolipoamide to lipoamide.|$|R
50|$|Procainamide is metabolized in {{the liver}} to {{acecainide}} by N-acetyltransferase, an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> is genetically determined. N-Acetyltransferase is an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> catalyzes the transfer of acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA to arylamines and aromatic amines such as procainamide.|$|R
5|$|Inhibitors of <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> {{directly}} metabolize amphetamine (particularly CYP2D6 and FMO3) will {{prolong the}} elimination of amphetamine and increase drug effects.|$|E
5|$|Metabolism {{involves}} {{a vast array}} of chemical reactions, but most fall under a few basic types of reactions that involve the transfer of functional groups of atoms and their bonds within molecules. This common chemistry allows cells to use a small set of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions. These group-transfer intermediates are called coenzymes. Each class of group-transfer reactions is carried out by a particular coenzyme, which is the substrate for a set of <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> produce it, and a set of <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> consume it. These coenzymes are therefore continuously made, consumed and then recycled.|$|E
5|$|Proteasomes are protein {{complexes}} which degrade unneeded {{or damaged}} proteins by proteolysis, a chemical reaction that breaks peptide bonds. <b>Enzymes</b> <b>that</b> help such reactions are called proteases.|$|E
50|$|Quercetin-3-sulfate 3'-sulfotransferase is an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> uses 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and {{quercetin}} 3-sulfate {{to produce}} adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and quercetin 3,3'-bissulfate. Quercetin-3-sulfate 4'-sulfotransferase is an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> uses 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and quercetin 3-sulfate to produce adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and quercetin 3,4'-bissulfate. Both enzymes {{can be found}} in Flaveria chlorifolia. Quercetin-3,3'-bissulfate 7-sulfotransferase is an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> uses 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and quercetin 3,3'-bissulfate to produce adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and quercetin 3,7,3'-trissulfate. The enzyme {{can be found in}} Flaveria sp.|$|R
50|$|The suffix -ase {{is used in}} {{biochemistry}} to form {{names of}} enzymes. The most common way to name enzymes is to add this suffix onto {{the end of the}} substrate, e.g. an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> breaks down peroxides may be called peroxidase; the <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> produces telomeres is called telomerase. Sometimes enzymes are named for the function they perform, rather than substrate, e.g. the <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> polymerizes (assembles) DNA into strands is called polymerase; see also reverse transcriptase.|$|R
50|$|Alpha-Fucosidase is an <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> {{breaks down}} fucose.|$|R
5|$|RNA {{replication}} is the copying of one RNA to another. Many viruses replicate this way. The <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> copy RNA to new RNA, called RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, {{are also}} found in many eukaryotes where {{they are involved in}} RNA silencing.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was once}} thought to be a simple {{solution}} of molecules, the cytosol has multiple levels of organization. These include concentration gradients of small molecules such as calcium, large complexes of <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> act together to carry out metabolic pathways, and protein complexes such as proteasomes and carboxysomes that enclose and separate parts of the cytosol.|$|E
5|$|Anti-vitamins are {{chemical}} compounds that inhibit the absorption or actions of vitamins. For example, avidin is a protein in raw egg whites that inhibits {{the absorption of}} biotin; it is deactivated by cooking. Pyrithiamine, a synthetic compound, has a molecular structure similar to thiamine, vitamin B1, and inhibits the <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> use thiamine.|$|E

5|$|HIV {{infections are}} usually {{treated with a}} {{combination}} of antiviral drugs, each targeting a different stage in the virus's life-cycle. There are drugs that prevent the virus from attaching to cells, others that are nucleoside analogues and some poison the virus's <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> it needs to reproduce. The success of these drugs is proof of the importance of knowing how viruses reproduce.|$|E
5|$|Lead has {{no known}} physiologically {{relevant}} {{role in the}} body, and its harmful effects are myriad. Lead and other heavy metals create reactive radicals which damage cell structures including DNA and cell membranes. Lead also interferes with DNA transcription, <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> help in the synthesis of vitamin D, and <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> maintain {{the integrity of the}} cell membrane. Anemia may result when the cell membranes of red blood cells become more fragile as the result of damage to their membranes. Lead interferes with metabolism of bones and teeth and alters the permeability of blood vessels and collagen synthesis. Lead may also be harmful to the developing immune system, causing production of excessive inflammatory proteins; this mechanism may mean that lead exposure is a risk factor for asthma in children. Lead exposure has also been associated with a decrease in activity of immune cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Lead also interferes with the normal metabolism of calcium in cells and causes it to build up within them.|$|E
5|$|Proteins can {{associate}} to form protein complexes, these often contain {{a set of}} proteins with similar functions, such as <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> carry out several steps in the same metabolic pathway. This organization can allow substrate channeling, which is when the product of one enzyme is passed directly to the next enzyme in a pathway without being released into solution. Channeling can make a pathway more rapid and efficient {{than it would be}} if the enzymes were randomly distributed in the cytosol, and can also prevent the release of unstable reaction intermediates. Although a wide variety of metabolic pathways involve <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> are tightly bound to each other, others may involve more loosely associated complexes that are very difficult to study outside the cell. Consequently, the importance of these complexes for metabolism in general remains unclear.|$|E

5000|$|Kynureninase or L-Kynurenine {{hydrolase}} (KYNU) (...) is a PLP dependent <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> catalyses the cleavage of kynurenine (Kyn) into {{anthranilic acid}} (Ant). It can also act on 3hKyn (to produce 3hAnt) {{and some other}} (3-arylcarbonyl)-alanines. Humans express one kynureninase <b>enzyme</b> <b>that</b> is encoded by the KYNU gene located on chromosome 2.|$|R
5|$|Some {{mitochondrial}} {{functions are}} performed only in {{specific types of}} cells. For example, mitochondria in liver cells contain <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> allow them to detoxify ammonia, a waste product of protein metabolism. A mutation in the genes regulating any of these functions can result in mitochondrial diseases.|$|E
5|$|The {{bacterium}} Paenibacillus tylopili {{has been}} {{isolated from the}} mycorrhizosphere of T.felleus; this is the region around its subterranean hyphae where nutrients released from the fungus affect {{the activity of the}} microbial population in the soil. The bacterium excretes <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> allow it to break down the biomolecule chitin.|$|E
5|$|The {{layers of}} the adrenal gland differ by function, with each layer having {{distinct}} <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> produce different hormones from a common precursor. The first enzymatic step {{in the production of}} all steroid hormones is cleavage of the cholesterol side chain, a reaction that forms pregnenolone as a product and is catalyzed by the enzyme P450scc, also known as cholesterol desmolase. After the production of pregnenolone, specific enzymes of each cortical layer further modify it. Enzymes involved in this process include both mitochondrial and microsomal P450s and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. Usually a number of intermediate steps in which pregnenolone is modified several times are required to form the functional hormones. <b>Enzymes</b> <b>that</b> catalyze reactions in these metabolic pathways are involved in a number of endocrine diseases. For example, {{the most common form of}} congenital adrenal hyperplasia develops as a result of deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in an intermediate step of cortisol production.|$|E

5|$|These {{mechanisms}} can {{be divided}} into single-substrate and multiple-substrate mechanisms. Kinetic studies on <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> only bind one substrate, such as triosephosphate isomerase, aim to measure the affinity with which the enzyme binds this substrate and the turnover rate. Some other examples of enzymes are phosphofructokinase and hexokinase, both of which are important for cellular respiration (glycolysis).|$|E
5|$|Topoisomerases {{introduce}} both single- and double-strand {{breaks in}} the course of changing the DNA's state of supercoiling, which is especially common in regions near an open replication fork. Such breaks are not considered DNA damage because they are a natural intermediate in the topoisomerase biochemical mechanism and are immediately repaired by the <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> created them.|$|E
5|$|A {{peroxidase}} enzyme {{known as}} MroAPO (Marasmius rotula aromatic peroxygenase) is attracting research interest for possible applications in biocatalysis. In general, <b>enzymes</b> <b>that</b> catalyze oxygen-transfer reactions are of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions. Fungal peroxidases can catalyze oxidations {{that are difficult}} for the organic chemist, including those involving aromatic substrates such as aniline, 4-aminophenol, hydroquinone, resorcinol, catechol, and paracetamol. The M.rotula enzyme is the first fungal peroxygenase that can be produced in high yields. It is highly stable over a wide pH range, and {{in a variety of}} organic solvents. The enzyme has other potential for use as a biosensor for aromatic substances in environmental analysis and drug monitoring.|$|E
