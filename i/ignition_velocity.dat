40|$|Ignition in a {{fuel bed}} where the {{ignition}} front propagates against the air flow is studied by modelling and through experiments. The model can predict the observed trends when moisture, bed density and air rate change. Geometrical factors, such as particle shape, size and orientation are combined {{to a single}} radiation parameter, {{which can be found}} experimentally. The main factors affecting ignition speed are the fuel moisture content, fuel volatile content, air flow rate through the bed, air temperature, the bulk density of the fuel bed, particle size, and particle shape. Up to the present most experiments have been carried out with homogenous and rather symmetric particles or with small particle size variation. This is not the case in many actual burners. Some of the measured flame spread rates were high compared to the results from literature, caused by the small bulk density of the bed and the thin particles of the tested fuels.

Side-on, backlit radiography provides data {{used by the}} National Ignition Campaign to measure time-dependent properties of the capsule ablator including its center of mass radius, velocity, and unablated mass. Previously, Callahan [D. A. Callahan et al., Phys. Plasmas 19, 056305 (2012) ] and Hicks [D. H. Hicks et al., Phys.

This paper focuses on implosion performance data in the &# 8220;rocket curve&# 8221; plane, velocity vs. ablator mass.

40|$|Measurements {{have been}} made of the {{in-flight}} dynamics of imploding capsules indirectly driven by laser energies of 1 &# 8211; 1. 7 &# 8201;MJ at the National Ignition Facility [Miller et al., Nucl.

Plasmas 18, 051002 (2011) ] to iteratively optimize the inputs required to achieve thermonuclear ignition in the laboratory. Using gated or streaked hard x-ray radiography, a suite of ablator performance parameters, including the time-resolved radius, velocity, mass, and thickness, have been determined throughout the acceleration history of surrogate gas-filled implosions. These measurements have been used to establish a dynamically consistent model of the ablative drive history and shell compressibility throughout the implosion trajectory. First results showed that the peak velocity of the original 1. 3 -MJ Ge-doped polymer (CH) point design using Auhohlraums reached only 75 % of the required <b>ignition</b> <b>velocity.</b> Several capsule, hohlraum, and laser pulse changes were then implemented to improve this and other aspects of implosion performance and a dedicated effort was undertaken to test the sensitivity of the ablative drive to the rise time and length of the main laser pulse. Changing to Si rather than Ge-doped inner ablator layers and increasing the pulse length together raised peak velocity to 93 %&# 8201;&# 0177;&# 8201; 5 % of the ignition goal using a 1. 5 &# 8201;MJ, 420 TW pulse. Further lengthening the pulse so that the laser remained on until the capsule reached 30 % (rather than 60 %&# 8211; 70 %) of its initial radius, reduced the shell thickness and improved the final fuel &# 0961;R on companion shots with a cryogenic hydrogen fuel layer. Improved drive efficiency was observed using U rather than Auhohlraums, which was expected, and by slowing the rise time of laser pulse, which was not. The effect of changing the Si-dopant concentration and distribution, as well as the effect of using a larger initial shell thickness were also examined, both of which indicated that instabilities seeded at the ablation front are a significant source of hydrodynamic mix into the central hot spot. Additionally, a direct test of the surrogacy of cryogenic fuel layered versus gas-filled targets was performed. Together all these measurements have established the fundamental ablative-rocket relationship describing the dependence of implosion velocity on fractional ablator mass remaining. This curve shows a lower-than-expected ablator mass at a given velocity, making the capsule more susceptible to feedthrough of instabilities from the ablation front into the fuel and hot spot. This combination of low velocity and low ablator mass indicates that reaching ignition on the NIF will require > 20 &# 8201;&# 0956;m (&# 8764; 10 %) thicker targets and laser powers at or beyond facility limits...|$|E
40|$|Coal {{energized}} the 19 "' century while oil {{worked for}} the 20 "' century. The question that remains pending is the future energy source. With the expanding population and growing demands from industrialization of countries such as India and China, total reliance on fossil fuel is not sustainable. The urgent need for a green and sustainable fuel prompted research into energy crops {{as an alternative to}} fossil fuels. There is a need to identify a suitable biomass species, which can provide high-energy outputs in order to replace conventional fossil fuel. The type of biomass used would then depend on the energy conversion process and the form in which the energy is required. Theoretical and experimental studies are also required to investigate the relevant parameters for future process optimisation. In response to this demand, {{the first part of this}} PhD study focuses on examining the parameters affecting the behaviour of solid bed combustion in a fixed bed reactor. Extensive experimental investigation aimed at studying the behaviour of various biomass materials in fixed bed combustion was successfully completed. The parameters investigated in this experimental programme were the influence of primary air flow rates and particle sizes. Complementary conversion technology studied in this PhD is the solid bed gasification in a counter-current fixed bed reactor. The proposed gasifier is part of a two-stage integrated unit that ultimately aims to utilise biomass fuel such as wood chips and fuel pellets derived from agricultural waste. Experimental work was carried out to increase the understanding of the underlying principle of the gasification process. Parameters studied were the steam/air ratio, reactor temperature and particle size. The results obtained from the combustion tests showed that the burning rate, <b>ignition</b> <b>velocity</b> and flue gas composition were governed by the primary air flow. Single stage combustion occurred at higher air flow rates. It was also observed that the ignition front speed was inversely proportional to the bulk density. Larger particles have a lower ignition front speed and burning rate. The average burning rates of herbaceous fuels were 3 - 4 times slower compared to other biomass materials such as willow wood, miscanthus pellets and RDF waste. Channelling occurred around the side wall of the reactor for small miscanthus pellets and at several locations in the bed for larger particles (35 mm cube). However, the observed channelling effect is severe in the test cases for uncut straw. The study of the gasification process showed that the hydrogen yield is influenced by the steam/air ratio, total flow rate of reactants, reactor temperature and particle size. The production of methane was negligible and no higher hydrocarbons were detected. A computational code known as the Fluid Dynamics of Incinerator Combustion code (FLIC) was used to interpret the experimental data. In this model, the initial solid waste undergoes step changes in the volume of its components consisting of moisture, volatile, fixed carbon, ash and internal pore space. The code was adapted to incorporate the steam-char reactions and gas phase reactions for the modelling of the gasification process. Comparison between the experimental results and model predictions showed good agreement. The combustion and gasification characteristics such as the burning rate, ignition rate, temperature profiles and gaseous emissions showed similar trends.

40|$|Chemical kinetic {{mechanisms}} for simulation of syngas (H 2 + CO) combustion {{are important for}} development of efficient practical applications, such as gas turbines. A useful syngas mechanism {{has to be able}} to accurately predict laminar burning <b>velocities,</b> <b>ignition</b> delays, and oxidation of gas mixtures of varying composition over a range of temperatures and pressures. In the present work, the performance of a new H 2 /CO combustion mechanism is analyzed. The mechanism is built on reaction rate constants chosen from the most accurate available kinetic data, and this is thoroughly discussed. The mechanism is validated for a wide range of experimental data from the literature. Particular attention is paid to chemistry of the species HOCO, produced from CO + OH reaction and removed by decomposition or radical reactions. Most available syngas mechanisms do not include HOCO because it is only expected to be of importance at some extreme high-pressure and low-temperature conditions. The species is, however, essential in hierarchically extended {{mechanisms for}} small oxygenated hydrocarbons, and its influence on the H 2 /CO subset of reactions needs to be further understood to ensure accurate mechanism development for a range of fuels.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{sensitivity}} of the flame propagation in a Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf to initial conditions during the subsonic burning phase (deflagration), using 2 D simulations of the full WD. Results are presented {{for a wide variety of}} initial flame distributions including central and off-center single point and multi-point, simultaneous and non-simultaneous, ignitions. We also examine the effects of convective velocity field which should exist at the core before the thermo-nuclear runaway. Our main conclusion suggests that the amounts of burning products and their distributions through the deflagration phase are extremely sensitive to initial conditions, much more sensitive than presented in previous studies. In particular, we find that more complex configurations such as even slight off-center ignitions, non-simultaneous multi-point <b>ignitions</b> and <b>velocity</b> fields tend to favor solutions in which individual plumes rise faster than the bulk of a typical Rayleigh-Taylor driven, unstable burning front. The difference to previous calculations for an octant of a WD may be understood as a consequence of the suppression of l= 1, 2 modes. Our results are consistent with full star calculations by the Chicago group. Moreover, the total amount of nuclear burning during the phase of subsonic burning depends sensitively on the initial conditions and may cause the WD to pulsate or to become unbound. We discuss the implications of the results on current models for Type Ia SNe, limitations imposed by the 2 -D nature of our study, and suggest directions for further study.

40|$|Type Ia Supernovae {{are thought}} to be {{thermonuclear}} explosions of massive white dwarfs (WD). We present the first study of multi-dimensional effects during the final hours prior to the thermonuclear runaway which leads to the explosion. The calculations utilize an implicit, 2 -D hydro code. Mixing and the ignition process are studied in detail. We find that the initial chemical structure of the WD is changed but the material is not fully homogenized. The exploding WD sustains a central region with a low C/O ratio. This implies that the explosive nuclear burning will begin in a partially C-depleted environment. The thermonuclear runaway happens in a well defined region close to the center. It is induced by compressional heat when matter is brought inwards by convective flows. We find no evidence for multiple spot or strong off-center <b>ignition.</b> Convective <b>velocities</b> are of the order of 100 km/sec which is well above the effective burning speeds in SNe Ia previously expected right after the runaway. For about 0. 5 to 1 sec, the speed of the burning front will neither be determined by the laminar speed nor the Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities but by convective flows produced prior to the runaway. The consequences are discussed for our under- standing of the detailed physics of the flame propagation, the deflagration detonation transition, and the nucleosynthesis in the central layers. Our results strongly suggest the pre-conditioning of the progenitor as a key-factor for our understanding of the diversity in SNeIa. Comment: 16 pages + 10 figures, ApJ accepted.

An optical sensor was developed and utilized for the observation of ignition zone characteristics over varying refresh conditions that showed decreasing ignition delay times when approaching marginally fuelrich reactant mixtures. A wide range of equivalence ratios for ethylene/air mixtures were explored and a limited number of JP- 10 /air mixtures. The JP- 10 /air fuel mixtures were nearly impossible to ignite at characteristic velocities greater than 35 m/s until a porous ignition shield was installed.

The resulting combustion products proceeded to ignite the remaining fuel-air mixture. The ignition shield design appears to locally prevent a complete purge of the previous cycle's products, and a transient plasma discharge was still required for subsequent ignition to occur.

40|$|The flame {{velocities}} of unconfined gas explosions {{depend on}} the cloud size and {{the distance from the}} initiating source. The mechanisms for this effect are not fully understood; a possible explanation is turbulence generated by the propagating flame front. The molecular bands in the flame front are exposed to continuously increasing radiation intensity of water bands in the interior of the reaction product ball. A first approach to verifying this assumption is described in this paper. The flame propagation was observed by high speed video techniques including time resolved spectroscopy in the UV-Vis-NIR spectral range with a time resolution up to 3, 000 spectra/s. <b>Ignition,</b> flame head <b>velocity,</b> flame contours, reacting species and temperatures were evaluated. The evaluation used video brightness subtraction and 1 -dimensional image contraction to obtain traces of the movements perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Flame front velocities are found to be between 16 m/s and 25 m/s. Analysis focused in particular on the flame front, which is not smooth. Salients emerge on the surface to result in the well-known cellular structures. The radiation of various bands from the fire ball on the reacting species is estimated to have an influence on the flame velocity depending on the distance from initiation. Evaluation of OH-band and water band spectra might indicate might indicate higher temperatures of the flame front induced by radiation of the fireball.

In this work, a detailed chemical reaction mechanism for oxy-fuel combustion of sour gas is presented. To construct the mechanism, a CH[subscript 4] sub-mechanism was chosen based on a comparative validation study for oxy-fuel combustion. This mechanism was combined with a mechanism for H[subscript 2]S oxidation, and the sulfur sub-mechanism was then optimized to give better agreement with relevant experiments. The optimization targets included predictions for the laminar burning <b>velocity,</b> <b>ignition</b> delay time, and pyrolysis of H[subscript 2]S, and H[subscript 2]S oxidation in a flow reactor. The rate parameters of 15 sulfur reactions were varied in the optimization within their respective uncertainties.

40|$|The {{principal}} burning {{characteristics of}} a laminar flame comprise the fuel vapour pressure, the laminar burning <b>velocity,</b> <b>ignition</b> delay times, Markstein numbers for strain rate and curvature, the stretch rates for the onset of flame instabilities and of flame extinction for different mixtures. With the exception of ignition delay times, measurements of these are reported and discussed for ethanolâair mixtures. The measurements were in a spherical explosion bomb, with central ignition, in the regime of a developed stable, flame between that of an under or over-driven ignition and that of an unstable flame. Pressures ranged from 0. 1 to 1. 4 MPa, temperatures from 300 to 393 K, and equivalence ratios were between 0. 7 and 1. 5. It was important to ensure the relatively large volume of ethanol in rich mixtures at high pressures was fully evaporated. The maximum pressure for the measurements was the highest compatible with the maximum safe working pressure of the bomb. Many of the flames soon became unstable, due to DarrieusâLandau and thermo-diffusive instabilities. This effect increased with pressure and the flame wrinkling arising from the instabilities enhanced the flame speed. Both the critical Peclet number and the, more rational, associated critical Karlovitz stretch factor were evaluated {{at the onset of}} the instability. With increasing pressure, the onset of flame instability occurred earlier. The measured values of burning velocity are expressed in terms of their variations with temperature and pressure, and these are compared with those obtained by other researchers.

40|$|The laminar burning {{velocity}} of a fuel is {{the rate of}} normal propagation of a 1 D flame front relative to {{the movement of the}} unburned gas. This is a fundamental property of a fuel that affects many aspects of its combustion behaviour. Experimental values are required to validate kinetic simulations, and also to provide input for models of flashback, minimum ignition energy and turbulent combustion. Burning velocity affects burn duration and consequently power output in spark <b>ignition</b> engines. Burning <b>velocities</b> are affected by pressure, temperature, equivalence ratio, residuals, additives, and stretch rates. The constant volume vessel has been used as it is considered both the most versatile and accurate method of measuring laminar burning velocities. An existing combustion vessel and oven were refurbished and new systems built for fuel injection, ignition, experiment control, data acquisition and high speed schlieren photography. An existing multi-zone model was used to allow calculation of {{burning velocity}} from pressure and schlieren data, allowing the user to select data uncorrupted by heat transfer or cellularity. A twelve term correlation for burning velocity was validated using methane modelling data. The chosen data from all the experiments was then fitted to the correlation. Methane, n-butane, n-heptane, iso-octane, toluene, ethylbenzene and ethanol were tested over a wide range of initial pressures (0. 5, 1, 2 and 4 barA), temperatures (289 - 450 K) and equivalence ratios (0. 7 - 1. 4). For liquid fuels, tests with real residuals at mole fractions of up to 0. 3 were also conducted. Stoichiometric mixture tests were performed at two initial temperatures (380 and 450 K) and the same four initial pressures. For mixtures of iso-octane and ethylbenzene, percentage volumes of 12. 5, 25, 50 and 75 % iso-octane were tested.

The eventual goal of the project is to fly a hypersonic research vehicle at Mach 6 (2 km/s) {{at an altitude of}} 42 km for a continuous time interval of 360 seconds. Before this goal can be attained, however, several milestones must be achieved, the first of which is the testing of aircraft controls during launch in the transonic phase. The current Hypresearch mission envisions a first-stage separation and second-stage <b>ignition</b> at transonic <b>velocities,</b> hence it is important that all crucial systems function properly in the transonic regime. To achieve this, the Transonic Research Vehicle (TRV) project was set up. The subject of the thesis was the propulsion system of the TRV- 1, with the goal of accelerating a glider payload to Mach- 2 in vertical launch, and testing the payload separation mechanism while decelerating through the transonic phase. The goal of the thesis project was to design a solid rocket motor for the TRV- 1, and to verify its performance through simulations and static motor tests. Firstly, the project goal was broken down into a series of requirements. Main requirements included the velocity (Mach 2) to be attained by the vehicle, the mass (6. 25 kg) and pre-defined shape of the glider, as well as limitations on the acceleration (40 g) and resources in terms of cost, manpower, and materials/facilities accessible to students. The design process started with the preliminary design during which two design concepts were selected based on ballistic performance and trajectory simulations. In the detailed design phase, materials were selected and a detailed manufacturing, assembly, integration, and testing plan was drafted. In order to test the material properties of the selected design on a limited resources budget, a scaled-down test methodâthe so-called SGM or Single Grain Motor method was developed. Following a series of SGM tests, the final full-scale test configuration was selected, and several defects of the design were eradicated. However, during the SGM test campaigns, and the subsequent full-scale test, it was discovered that the actual performance in terms of total impulse was notably lower than that predicted by the model. Following the test campaigns, an investigation identified the causes of the performance loss to be excess water absorbed by the propellant during the curing process. A manufacturing method to prevent this in the future, as well as a design iteration of the motor to be performed in order to attain the mission goal, was recommended.

40|$|The {{origins of}} {{detailed}} and reduced kinetic {{models for the}} ignition and oxidation of alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons have been traced {{in this study and}} their development and application in the prediction of some aspects of hydrocarbon fuels have been explored. The scope and limitations for the application of certain formal model structures has been illustrated. The major objective in development and use of kinetic models has been concerned with autoignition and homogeneous combustion as a promising combustion mode for reducing emissions in reciprocating engines. Clearly, {{there is a need for}} models that can be used in conjunction with fluid dynamic codes and for this purpose brevity is pre-requisite. Comprehensive kinetic schemes can play a very important part in the validation process, but it would seem that more has yet to be achieved in validating comprehensive models as a satisfactory benchmark for hydrocarbon combustion in the low temperature region. A major objective of this work has been to develop kinetic mechanisms for model fuels in order to simulate the complex physico-chemical interactions in practical combustion systems. The mechanisms, after they have been assembled, have been validated against a wide range of combustion regimes. The latter include laminar premixed and diffusion flames as well plug flow reactors and shock tubes. In Chapter 3 a mechanism for n-heptane is presented and successfully validated against experimental data. The agreement between calculations and measurements is very well. Thereafter, a mechanism for n-decane, which has to be the aliphatic compound for surrogate fuels in representing real diesel and kerosene properties, has been extensively validated. In the mechanism only a small number of chemical species and reactions has been retained without losing in accuracy. This is of great advantage for using detailed chemistry in the flame let model for describing the chemistry-turbulence interactions when simulating autoignition, combustion or pollutant formation in internal combustion engines. The mechanismâs ability to reproduce the main experimental observations on intermediate species has been demonstrated by examining successively the main steps of the mechanism for the combustion of n-decane. The agreement between calculated and experimental mole fraction profiles is good for most species. Computed laminar burning <b>velocities,</b> <b>ignition</b> delay times and oxidation in jet-stirred reactors at moderate pressure show good agreement with experimental data. Toluene and 1, 2, 4 Trimethylbenzene have also successfully been modelled. Thereafter an extensively investigation of the autoignition in strained flow fields for all the above fuels has taken place. In Chapter 4 different methods for reducing chemical mechanisms are briefly described. An algorithm based on the CSP (Computational Singular Perturbation) method is used to derive a reduced mechanism for n-heptane. Finally in chapter 5 a new combustion mode, the so called Homogeneous Charge Combustion Ignition (HCCI) has been presented. The feasibility of this concept has been analysed based on simulations performed, using simple models. The potential in reducing emissions especially Soot and NOx has been demonstrated...|$|R
