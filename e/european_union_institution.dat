5000|$|The {{misuse of}} power test is another {{significant}} element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law. It holds that a lawful power must not be exercised for any other purpose than that {{for which it was}} conferred. According to the {{misuse of power}} test a decision by a <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> <b>institution</b> is only a misuse of power if [...] "it appears, on the basis of objective, relevant and consistent evidence, to have been adopted with the exclusive or main purpose of achieving any end other than those stated." [...] A rare instance where the European Court of Justice has held that a <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> <b>institution</b> has misused its powers, and therefore violated the general principle of legal uncertainty, is Giuffrida v Commission. The general principle of legal certainty is particularly stringently applied when European Union law imposes financial burdens on private parties.|$|E

5000|$|The {{legitimate}} expectation doctrine holds that [...] "those who act {{in good faith}} {{on the basis of}} law as it is, or seems to be, should not be frustrated in their expectations". This means that a <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> <b>institution,</b> once it has induced a party to take a particular course of action, must not renege on its earlier position if doing so would cause that party to suffer loss. The European Court of Justice has considered the {{legitimate expectation}} doctrine in cases where violation of the general principle of legal certainty was alleged in numerous cases involving agricultural policy and European Council regulations, with the leading case being Mulder v Minister van Landbouw en Visserij.|$|E
5000|$|In European Union law {{the general}} {{principle}} of legal certainty prohibits retroactive laws, i.e. laws {{should not take}} effect before they are published. The general principle also requires that sufficient information must be made public to enable parties {{to know what the}} law is and comply with it. For example, in Opel Austria v Council 1997 ECR II-39 Case T-115/94 The European Court of Justice held that European Council Regulation did not come into effect until it had been published. Opel had brought the action on the basis that the Regulation in question violated the principle of legal certainty, because it legally came into effect before it had been notified and the regulation published. The doctrine of legitimate expectation, which {{has its roots in the}} principles of legal certainty and good faith, is also a central element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law. The legitimate expectation doctrine holds that and that [...] "those who act in good faith on the basis of law as it is or seems to be should not be frustrated in their expectations". This means that a <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> <b>institution,</b> once it has induced a party to take a particular course of action, must not renege on its earlier position if doing so would cause the party to suffer loss. The European Court of Justice has considered the legitimate expectation doctrine in cases where violation of the general principle of legal certainty was alleged in numerous cases involving agricultural policy and European Council regulations, with the leading case being Mulder v Minister van Landbouw en Visserij 1988 ECR 2321 Case 120/86.

40|$|As {{the need}} to raise revenue becomes more {{pressing}} and public opposition to tax avoidance increases, the European Court of Justice has {{made it more difficult}} for the twenty-seven Member States of the European Union to prevent tax avoidance and shape fiscal policy. This article introduces the new anti-avoidance doctrine of the European Court of Justice and analyzes it from the perspective of taxpayers, Member States and the European Union legal order as a whole. This doctrine is problematic becasue it has created a legislative vacuum in Europe. No <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> <b>institution</b> has the authority to regulate direct taxation without the unanimous support of all twenty-seven Member States. As the European Court of Justice strikes down Member State efforts to prevent tax avoidance, no institution can step in to replace these Member State provisions. Member States are thus losing sovereignty over policy tax avoidance, but no legislative move toward an integrated approach is possible without the support of Member States. This article proposes several solutions to the problems posed by the doctrine...|$|E

Considering the current European institutional framework, this metaphor can isolate different issues: (1) the relationship between the philosophical and political tradition of Europe and the <b>European</b> <b>Union,</b> <b>institution</b> "artificial” in all respects; (2) the relationship between the community institution and the Catholic Church, representing the ancient "Christian roots" with which this institution seems introducing a conflict; (3) the turbulences in the East and in the Balkans, which are examples of the difficulties arising from nonunderstanding of the definition, (4) the idea of Europe and its myth in comparison with the European Union, forced to create different and weaker forms of identification...|$|E
40|$|The European Central Bank (ECB) has {{received}} a lot of criticism for its too little, too late performance to ease market pressures during the economic crisis. At the same time, the ECB and the Federal Reserve (FED) have managed the new economic realities that have emerged in the international context differently. Despite the criticisms, the European Central Bank is the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> <b>institution</b> that has assumed more control due to the new model of economic governance of the EU. Why did the Federal Reserve act so nimbly and quickly to calm the markets, while the ECB was so cautious in managing monetary policy? The aim {{of this paper is to}} perform a comparative analysis of the management of interest rates and other monetary policy measures undertaken by the Central Bank and the Federal Reserve during the economic crisis, as well as to understand the changes in the context of the ECB and the emergence of its authority within the European Union’s economic governance model since 2011.
