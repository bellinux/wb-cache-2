New cuts were constructed at Barnton, Crowton and Aston Grange between 1832 and 1835, and they then planned to construct a second lock beside each of the original locks. William Cubbitt was asked for advice on whether the river could be adapted for seagoing ships, and although he said it could, he did not think it would be cost <b>effective.</b> <b>Work</b> was then started on making the river [...] deep throughout, and building double locks suitable for 100-ton vessels which were [...] By 1845, Winnington, Acton and Hunts locks had been improved.

500|$|Asmussen {{said that}} one of the {{greatest}} challenges in developing God of War III for the PlayStation 3 was the [...] "complexity of everything"; individual tasks, such as designing Helios' decapitation, could take a year because the [...] "level of detail [...] expected [...] so high and intricate, it [...] multiple departments." [...] He said that the PlayStation 3's hardware capabilities allowed more flexibility in character creation and interaction with the environment. The character model for Kratos in the PlayStation 2 (PS2) games used about 5,000 polygons; the PS3 model was about 20,000 – a high number, but less than that used by other models such as Nathan Drake in , who used 35,000. Ken Feldman, the art director, commented that the polygon count was not the only factor, and cited the increased texture detail as {{one of the reasons for}} Kratos's realistic appearance. The developers used a new technique called blended normal mapping to add realism to the basic model and hugely enhance the range of animation available (e.g., muscle movement, including visible veins, and facial animations). All of the main protagonists were animated by hand because the animators produced more <b>effective</b> <b>work</b> than basic motion capture, though the voice actors' facial movements were recorded by Image Metrics's performance capture system. For animating things like hair, the animators created a secondary animation code, known as Dynamic Simulation, which allows the PS3 itself to mathematically calculate the way it should look; it accurately generates motion that previously took the animators long hours to replicate.|$|E

2500|$|Inspired by Thomas Hardy's play 'The Famous Tragedy of The Queen of Cornwall' the English {{composer}} Rutland Boughton, ( [...] 1878-1960), {{composed the}} music-drama 'The Queen of Cornwall' in 1923/24. The first performance {{took place at}} the Glastonbury Festival on August 21, 1924. Already famous for 'The Immortal Hour' and 'Bethlehem', Boughton's growth as a unique and powerful operatic composer is evident in this treatment of the Tristram and Isolde legend. Feeling that Hardy's play offered too much unrelieved grimness he received the playwright's permission to import a handful of lyrics from his earlier published poetical works. The result is an altogether impressive and <b>effective</b> <b>work,</b> thought by many to be Boughton's masterpiece in this genre.

2500|$|Sigmund Freud {{visited the}} Nancy School and his early {{neurological}} practice involved {{the use of}} hypnotism. However following {{the work of his}} mentor Josef Breuer—in particular a case where symptoms appeared partially resolved by what the patient, Bertha Pappenheim, dubbed a [...] "talking cure"—Freud began focusing on conditions that appeared to have psychological causes originating in childhood experiences and the unconscious mind. He went on to develop techniques such as free association, dream interpretation, transference and analysis of the id, ego and superego. His popular reputation as father of psychotherapy was established by his use of the distinct term [...] "psychoanalysis", tied to an overarching system of theories and methods, and by the <b>effective</b> <b>work</b> of his followers in rewriting history. Many theorists, including Alfred Adler, Carl Jung, Karen Horney, Anna Freud, Otto Rank, Erik Erikson, Melanie Klein and Heinz Kohut, built upon Freud's fundamental ideas and often developed their own systems of psychotherapy.

's (2002) theory on identity construction was developed and evaluated {{with the goal of}} creating a measure of identity formation that accounts for some of the challenges to identity associated with the postmodern era. The <b>Effective</b> Identity <b>Work</b> Inventory (EIWI) aims to assess individuals' experiences of themselves in their social environments in their day-to-day identity work, focusing specifically on life coherence, authenticity, self-acceptance, acceptance and recognition from others, integration of discrepant expectations, and agency. Factor analyses produced a four-factor solution (Life Coherence, Authenticity, Acceptance, Integration). Using the factor scores in cluster analysis, three unique patterns of <b>effective</b> identity <b>work</b> were identified. Discriminant analysis showed that, in particular, the factors Authenticity and Integration were most important for distinguishing between the three groups. Consequently, the three patterns of <b>effective</b> identity <b>work</b> were named: Low Authenticity - Moderate Integration, High Authenticity - Low Integration, and High Authenticity - High Integration. Both the individual aspects of <b>effective</b> identity <b>work</b> and the three patterns were examined more closely with respect to gender, positive body experience and mental health. Findings suggest that the aspects of <b>effective</b> identity <b>work</b> have a positive predictive relationship with positive body image and a negative predictive relationship with mental health problems. Results on gender suggest that girls experience more authenticity than boys, that boys show slightly more positive body image than girls, and that in general girls and boys experience mental health issues to a similar degree, though emotional problems are more prevalent in girls and conduct problems more prevalent in boys. Suggestions for revisions to the EIWI are made and implications for its use in identity research are discussed...|$|R
