For moving lights, he suggests attaching lighted tow to a bird, and letting it loose. Maury translates the passages in La Magie, pp. 58-59. Spiritualists, of course, will allege that the world-wide theory of spectral lights is based on fact, and that the hallucinations are not begotten by subjective conditions, but by a genuine 'phantasmogenetic agency'. Two men of science, Baron Schrenk- Notzing, and Dr. Gibotteau, vouch for illusions of light accompanying attempts by living agents to transfer a hallucinatory vision of themselves to persons at a distance (<b>Journal</b> <b>S.</b> P.

5000|$|On {{his return}} to India in 1930, he {{discovered}} that the guide lecturer position had been eliminated {{due to lack of}} funds. Unable to find a suitable job, Salim Ali and Tehmina moved to Kihim, a coastal village near Mumbai. Here he had the opportunity to study at close hand, the breeding of the baya weaver and discovered their mating system of sequential polygamy. Later commentators have suggested that this study was {{in the tradition of the}} Mughal naturalists that Salim Ali admired and wrote about in three part series on the Moghul emperors as naturalists. A few months were then spent in Kotagiri where he had been invited by K M Anantan, a retired army doctor who had served in Mesopotamia during World War I. He also came in contact with Mrs Kinloch, who lived at Longwood Shola, and her son-in-law R C Morris, who lived in the Biligirirangan Hills. He then discovered an opportunity to conduct systematic bird surveys of the princely states that included Hyderabad, Cochin, Travancore, Gwalior, Indore and Bhopal with the sponsorship of the rulers of those states. He was aided and supported in these surveys by Hugh Whistler who had surveyed many parts of India and had kept very careful notes. Interestingly, Whistler had initially been irritated by the unknown Indian. Whistler had in a note on The study of Indian birds mentioned that the long tail feathers of the greater racket-tailed drongo lacked webbing on the inner vane. Salim Ali wrote that such inaccuracies had been carried on from early literature and pointed out that it was incorrect on account of a twist in the rachis.

40|$|We {{argue that}} greater degrees of {{international}} integration lead to {{lower levels of}} corruption, which we define as the misuse of public office for private gain. We theorize that international factors affect a country s level of corruption through two principal channels. One acts through economic incentives, altering for various actors {{the costs and benefits}} of engaging in corrupt acts. The second mode is normative. Prevailing norms in international society delegitimate and stigmatize corruption. Countries that are more integrated into international society are more exposed to economic and normative pressures against corruption. We therefore test the following hypothesis: the more a country is tied into international networks of exchange, communication, and organization, the lower its level of corruption is likely to be. The analysis of data from approximately 150 countries strongly confirms our expectation. A grant from the Center for Global Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of California, Irvine supported the research for this article.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{theoretical}} {{implications of the}} logic of practicality in world politics. In social and political life, many practices do not primarily derive from instrumental rationality (logic of consequences), norm-following (logic of appropriateness), or communicative action (logic of arguing). These three logics of social action suffer from a representational bias in that they focus on what agents think about instead of what they think from. According to the logic of practicality, practices {{are the result of}} inarticulate know-how that makes {{what is to be done}} self-evident or commonsensical. Insights from philosophy, psychology, and sociology provide empirical and theoretical support for this view. Though complementary with other logics of social action, the logic of practicality is ontologically prior because it is located at the intersection of structure and agency. Building on Bourdieu, this article develops a theory of practice of security communities arguing that peace exists in and through practice when security officials practical sense makes diplomacy the self-evident way to solving interstate disputes. The article concludes on the methodological quandaries raised by the logic of practicality in world politics.

To constitute a true science of service, services research must use valid measures. The sine qua non requirement for a valid measure is content validity, which comprises item-content validity and answer-scale validity (see Rossiter, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 2002, and C-OAR-SE Construct Measurement for the Social Sciences, Springer, forthcoming). The present article begins by criticizing the content validity of E-S-QUAL (Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Malhotra [Parasuraman, A., V. A. Zeithaml, A. Malhotra. 2005. E-S-QUAL: A Multiple-Item Scale for Assessing Electronic Service Quality.

This new measure seeks potential customers 2 ̆ 7 and current customers 2 ̆ 7 judgments {{about the quality of the}} components of e-retail service (thus ensuring high item-content validity), which are rated in terms of behavioral answer categories (which have high answer-scale validity).

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{simulate}} the large scale production of monoclonal antibody (mAb) by using SuperPro Designer (SPD). Since the first discovery of mAb at 1970 s, this type of antibody had become the most rapidly growing class of pharmaceutical. Problem with mAb production is the high cost and low amount of production but high demand for this therapeutic. In order to overcome this problem, large scale production had become one of the top priorities for mAb production. Large scale simulation study by using SPD can minimize time and cost production by eliminate the high cost of trial-and-error steps, as well as to find and simulate the optimization process for mAb production. In order to achieve the objective of this research, study is conducted in two steps which are simulation on the upstream and downstream process. For the upstream process, the stoichiometric equation is constructed base on the laboratory data and used to simulate the large volume of fermenter. For a downstream process, three flow of downstream process from different source a built, simulated and compared to choose the best process for purification of mAb. The result shows that the upstream process for 20000 L fermenter produced 0. 00510 kg/Batch of mAb with concentration of 3. 8 × 10 - 4 g/L (5. 1103 g/Batch). Compared to the flow from SPD source and <b>journal</b> (<b>S.</b> Sommerfeld and J. Strube, 2005), the best downstream process was the flow from Inno Biologics Sdn.
