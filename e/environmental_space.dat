500|$|The {{habitat of}} a species {{describes}} the environment over which a species is known to occur {{and the type of}} community that is formed as a result. More specifically, [...] "habitats can be defined as regions in <b>environmental</b> <b>space</b> that are composed of multiple dimensions, each representing a biotic or abiotic environmental variable; that is, any component or characteristic of the environment related directly (e.g. forage biomass and quality) or indirectly (e.g. elevation) to the use of a location by the animal." [...] For example, a habitat might be an aquatic or terrestrial environment that can be further categorized as a montane or alpine ecosystem. Habitat shifts provide important evidence of competition in nature where one population changes relative to the habitats that most other individuals of the species occupy. For example, one population {{of a species}} of tropical lizards (Tropidurus hispidus) has a flattened body relative to the main populations that live in open savanna. The population that lives in an isolated rock outcrop hides in crevasses where its flattened body offers a selective advantage. Habitat shifts also occur in the developmental life history of amphibians, and in insects that transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. Biotope and habitat are sometimes used interchangeably, but the former applies to a community's environment, whereas the latter applies to a species' environment.|$|E

40|$|Using the {{development}} of intergovernmental environmental cooperation in the Baltic Sea area as a concrete example, {{the aim of this}} study is to explore how the ‘environ- ment’ in situations of environmental interdependence is identified and institutional- ised as political-geographical objects. ‘Environmental interdependence’ is to this end conceptualised as a tension between ‘political spaces’ of discrete state territories and ‘environmental spaces’ of spatially nested ecosystems. This tension between geo- graphies of political separateness and environmental wholeness is the implicit or explicit basis for a large and varied literature. But in both its critical and problem- solving manifestations, this literature tends to naturalise the spatiality of environmen- tal concerns: <b>environmental</b> <b>spaces</b> are generally taken for granted. On the suggestion that there is a subtle politics to the specification of environmental geographies, the study therefore proposes a critical geopolitics of <b>environmental</b> <b>spaces.</b> Three pro- positions are in this respect advanced. First, it is proposed that <b>environmental</b> <b>spaces</b> are identified through the establishment of ‘environmental enclosures’, which situate environmental concerns as geographical objects for perception and action. But because of the spatial ambiguity of ecosystems and ecosystem-thinking, such enclosures are not simply facts of nature; rather, at the intersection between material realities and metaphorical representations, they are produced, reproduced and contested through political processes of scaling. Second, the study proposes that <b>environmental</b> <b>spaces</b> in practical politics can be institutionalised as ‘environmental regions’, which are conceptualised as dynamic socio-spatial entities. Finally, it is proposed that the boundaries produced during the enclosure and regionalisation of <b>environmental</b> <b>spaces</b> are ‘boundaries of inclusion’ in the sense that they establish a socio-spatial identity around environmental concerns, which does not have an ‘Other’ as their necessary antipode...|$|R

5000|$|The {{concept of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>space</b> {{is the amount}} of any particularresource that can be {{consumed}} by a country without threatening the continuedavailability of that resource, assuming that everyone in the world isentitled to an equal share. The weakness of the concept is that it requirescalculating the maximum sustainable consumption rate of each differentresource globally. This rate could be set by either the maximum sustainableyield (say for forests or fisheries) or the assimilative capacity of theenvironment (e.g. for [...] or chlorine), but both quantities are very difficult to determine, so the 'environmental space' has rather large error limits and is therefore hard to defend in policy discussions. A further difficulty isthat there is a different 'environmental space' for each kind of resource,and as they each necessarily have different units of measure, they cannot beadded to get an overall <b>environmental</b> <b>space</b> for all the resources consumed by a country. Theidea of <b>environmental</b> <b>space</b> was promoted quite strongly by Friends of the Earth Europe in themid-1990s, but it is rarely used now, because of the aforementioned difficulties, and has essentially been superseded by 'ecological footprint'. The advantage of the ecological footprint is that every kind of resource use is converted to a land area basis, {{so that they can be}} added to produce an overall figure fora country, allowing comparisons to be made.|$|E

5000|$|As {{early as}} 1969, Phillips was already {{developing}} {{an approach that}} she has continued to expand over decades of work and dozens of major pieces. Her idea, she wrote in 1971, was “to create {{a new kind of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>space</b> where the structure of the space was defined by human interaction.” At the time, Phillips was known for sound environments that were structured around the communal act of eating. Phillips would “wire” the dinner table, and process the resulting signals using a combination of tuned oscillators, resulting in an electronic soundscape that responded to the sound patterns generated by the participants’ dinner. “To build sound structures I use electromagnetic fields where people actually become electronic components in the circuit,” she wrote at the time in the pages of Radical Software, an early video art journal that was a critical platform for the discussion of emergent media and cybernetic art in the early 1970s. “Therefore, the collective presence and movement {{of the people in the}} field feeds back audio responses…. The tones are in response to the total actions and relationships of the participants. The people themselves, are also potential sound structures realized only through contact with other people. With the new feedback, audio and kinestethic patterns evolve." [...] Phillips' inclusion in the pages of Radical Software signals her affinity with and closeness to the early video art scene.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{investigates the}} dynamic relations between sound, {{space and the}} audience perception as related to an artist’s intention. What is the relation between sound and space in the sonic arts, and to what kind of merger does it lead? What relationship exists between {{the intention of the}} composer and the perception of the audience regarding architectural and <b>environmental</b> <b>spaces?</b> Is there a common thread of perception of architectural and <b>environmental</b> <b>spaces</b> among participants? Is embodiment a key for the perception of the dynamic relations of sound and space? The framework for the investigation is based on a map of three defined spaces (Real, Virtual, and Hyperbiological) included in a portfolio of six works (three electroacoustic compositions, two sound installations, and one performance), which lead to the analysis of the perception of space, namely, the perception of architectural and <b>environmental</b> <b>spaces</b> as required by the portfolio. The original knowledge resides in the exploration of a potential common representation (space and sound perception being, of course, a personal representation) of internal perceptual spaces and mental imageries generated by the works. The act of listening {{plays a major role in}} the development of the portfolio presented and includes Pauline Oliveros’ concept of deep listening (Oliveros 2005). Sound and space are intimately related in the portfolio. One particular element emerging from this relationship is the plastic quality of sound, meaning that sound is considered and observed as a material that is shaped by space. From this perspective the research investigates the ‘sculptural’ and morphological quality of the relationship between sound and space. The results include the specific language and signature of the artworks that delineate the intersection of music and fine arts. The portfolio pays a large tribute to several iconic artists present in the outposts of sound blurred by space. Composers and artists are therefore presented in the theoretical section in order to highlight how their pioneering works have influenced and informed the present research portfolio. The analysis of the perception of the artworks relates to a methodology based on an empirical survey inspired by phenomenology...|$|R

40|$|Institutionalising <b>Environmental</b> <b>Space</b> at the Global Level The {{notion of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>space</b> has been {{advanced}} to make sustainability concrete. In {{a world where}} environmental limits are becoming increasingly apparent, the idea, based on recognition of these limits and a strong equity principle, offers a more positive {{approach to dealing with}} the growing „environmental scarcity ‟ than the „protection of environmental security ‟ scenarios that are presently unfolding themselves. However, although there have been some moves towards the adoption of the notion of <b>environmental</b> <b>space</b> as a basis for policy development, at the national and international level, questions about whether and how the idea can or should be implemented remain largely open. What seems clear is that, to promote feasibility, fairness and effectiveness, the notion of <b>environmental</b> <b>space</b> will need to be institutionalised at the global level. This paper discusses and assesses three options for globally institutionalising this approach, and assesses these on their strengths, weaknesses and limitations {{in the light of the}} principles of ecological effectiveness, equity, economic efficiency and feasibility (practical and political). The three options are: the commercialisation of <b>environmental</b> <b>space,</b> for instance, in the form of greenhouse gas emissions trading schemes; global „green planning‟, weakly exemplified by the adoption of Agenda 21, the Millennium Development Goals and other global policy agreements; and a global income policy, and idea that, as yet, has not even entered the international agenda, but which, in my view, merits serious consideration. The paper concludes that all three options have significant weaknesses and limitations, and that none of these, as well as various other options, is likely to provide, on its own, an effective means of implementing the notion of <b>environmental</b> <b>space.</b> Each option appeals to a different rationality (economic, political, ethical), and it is likely that, if the idea of <b>environmental</b> <b>space</b> is to be institutionalised, a combination of these approaches will be required.

40|$|The {{notion of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>space,</b> {{based on the}} {{principles}} of environmental limits and sharing environmental resources equitably, offers a starting point for a positive approach to the global "return of scarcity" challenge, notably by providing a basis legitimating and strengthening the global governance of environmental and resource limits. First, it provides a cognitive framework for determining limits and for dealing with these more comprehensively and effectively, at all levels of government. Second, the <b>environmental</b> <b>space</b> approach supports, notably at the global level, a more equitable distribution of access to, and/or the benefits from, increasingly scarce resources.

40|$|Very little {{empirical}} {{work has}} been done to assess the potential impacts of climate change upon terrestrial biodiversity within small islands, many of which contribute to global species diversity due to high levels of endemicity. This study illustrates projections of not only individual but also the 'collective' response of a group of high conservation value tree species to climate change within the Caribbean small island of Trinidad. The species distribution modelling algorithm MaxEnt was used to construct models of the realised present <b>environmental</b> <b>space</b> occupied by these species based on present day climate and other environmental factors. These models were then used to estimate present and future (2050; SRES A 2) distributions of these species across Trinidad. Both present and future model output were incorporated to create change maps which illustrate projected expansions, contractions and areas of stable <b>environmental</b> <b>space</b> for each species. Individual change maps were combined to create a 'collective' change map portraying projected changes in the <b>environmental</b> <b>space</b> of this species group as a whole. Most individual species and the collective group response were projected to lose more than 50 % of present <b>environmental</b> <b>space,</b> with the latter being limited to the southern edge of the island. Our results suggest that small islands may experience an eventual disappearance of endemics and other valuable species under SRES A 2 conditions, which may serve to further depreciate global terrestrial species diversity. Application of this 'collective' response may be particularly useful for planning within the limited geographic spaces available for conservation within small islands. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
