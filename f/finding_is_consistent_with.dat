5|$|Cerro Blanco {{is part of}} the Central Volcanic Zone and {{is located}} at the {{southern}} limit of the Puna. It forms a volcanic unit together with the Aguada Alumbrera ignimbrite, at {{the eastern edge of the}} Cordillera de San Buenaventura. Rocks beneath this unit include dacitic–trachyandesitic volcanites 9–7 mya old and an igneous-metamorphic granitic basement containing orthogneiss, quartz of Neoproterozoic-early Paleozoic age, containing paleozoic mafic to ultramafic volcanic inclusions. The Cordillera de San Buenaventura is formed from lava domes and volcanic complexes of intermediary composition of Upper Miocene–Quaternary age. During the Miocene-Pleistocene, the isotope and chemical composition of areal magmas has moved away from arc like magmas to distinctly water-poor and unoxidized petrologies. This <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> a hot mantle forming after delamination of the crust and migration of the arc.|$|E
25|$|Although {{conscientiousness}} {{is generally}} {{seen as a}} positive trait to possess, recent {{research has suggested that}} in some situations it may be harmful for well-being. In a prospective study of 9570 individuals over four years, highly conscientious people suffered {{more than twice as much}} if they became unemployed. The authors suggested this may be due to conscientious people making different attributions about why they became unemployed, or through experiencing stronger reactions following failure. This <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> perspectives which see no trait as inherently positive or negative, but rather the consequences of the trait being dependent on the situation and concomitant goals and motivations.|$|E

2500|$|Ruderfer et al. (2006) {{analyzed}} the ancestry of natural S. cerevisiae strains {{and concluded that}} outcrossing occurs only about once every 50,000 cell divisions. Thus, it appears that in nature, mating is likely most often between closely related yeast cells. [...] Mating occurs when haploid cells of opposite mating type MATa and MATα come into contact. [...] Ruderfer et al. pointed out that such contacts are frequent between closely related yeast cells for two reasons. [...] The first is that cells of opposite mating type are present {{together in the same}} ascus, the sac that contains the cells directly produced by a single meiosis, and these cells can mate with each other. [...] The second reason is that haploid cells of one mating type, upon cell division, often produce cells of the opposite mating type with which they can mate. The relative rarity in nature of meiotic events that result from outcrossing is inconsistent with the idea that production of genetic variation is the main selective force maintaining meiosis in this organism. [...] However, this <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the alternative idea that the main selective force maintaining meiosis is enhanced recombinational repair of DNA damage, since this benefit is realized during each meiosis, whether or not out-crossing occurs.|$|E
2500|$|Also, at the {{recommendation}} of Houston Police Chief Harold Hurtt, White had 50 red-light cameras installed around Houston. Originally four intersections were {{used to test the}} traffic cameras in September 2006. The trial cameras met the requirements and were approved for using throughout the city. The red-light cameras caused controversy, though, even leading to some lawsuits. Many people argued that this was just a way for the city to make money at the expense of public safety. However, White has stood behind his decision to keep the red light cameras. Studies have revealed mixed results of the effectiveness of red-light cameras. A study in Houston in 2008 revealed an increase in accidents at intersections with red light cameras, although it also revealed a decrease in citations. A city-financed study of red-light cameras at Houston intersections shows traffic accidents doubled at those intersections in their first year. [...] The study also found that citations decreased. However, other studies have found that red-light cameras reduce accidents and citations. A study by Texas A University found that accidents were reduced in Texas by 30%. Several studies funded by insurance trade groups which study traffic safety, have found the cameras had a dramatic effect and reduced accidents by as much as 30 percent. A study released in 2008 from the Texas Transportation Institute found a 30 percent reduction across the state. A study in Lubbock, Texas of red light cameras showed a 52% increase in accidents, so the City Council voted against installing them. A news investigation found that the Houston intersections with cameras often had yellow lights that were too short, and violated Texas Department of Public Safety recommendations. Houston suburb Sugar Land found that the combination of lengthening yellow lights and installing cameras reduced violations by 96 percent. This <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> a March 2005 Texas Transportation Institute study of 181 Texas intersections during a three-year period which found that increasing the length of yellow-light time by one second reduced violations by 53 percent and crashes by 40 percent.|$|E

50|$|A third example {{has been}} seen in yeast. Evolutionary events in which stop codons are lost {{preserve}} the reading frame much more often than would be expected from mutation bias.

50|$|Nearly {{all modern}} non-African humans have 1% to 4% of their DNA derived from Neanderthal DNA, and this <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> recent studies {{indicating}} that the divergence of some human alleles dates to one Ma, although the interpretation of these studies has been questioned.

50|$|Consumption of dark fleshed fish {{containing}} dietary {{omega-3 fatty}} acids {{is associated with a}} decreased incidence of dry eyes syndrome in women.

50|$|Although the two {{isozymes}} (ALDH1 and ALDH2) do {{not share}} a common subunit, the homology between the human ALDH1 and ALDH2 proteins is 66% at the coding nucleotide level and 69% at the amino acid level, which {{is found to be}} lower than the 91% homology between human ALDH1 and horse ALDH1. Such a <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> evidence suggesting the early evolutionary divergence between cytosolic and mitochondrial isozymes, as seen in the 50% homology between pig mitochondrial and cytosolic asparatate aminotransferases.|$|E

50|$|A {{study by}} {{researchers}} at the Federal Judicial Center has found that the enactment of CAFA was followed by {{an increase in the number}} of class actions filed in or removed to the federal courts based on diversity jurisdiction. This <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the congressional intent in enacting CAFA. The observed increase was due primarily to increases in consumer class actions. Somewhat surprisingly, the FJC study found that much of the increase in diversity class actions has been driven by an increase in original filings in federal courts. This finding suggests that plaintiffs' attorneys are choosing the federal forum, post-CAFA, rather than defendants' counsel through removal, contrary to expectations.|$|E
50|$|The Custer (800-1250) and Turkey Creek phases (1250-1450) {{were located}} further west than the Paoli and Washita phases {{but on the}} same Washita and South Canadian Rivers.

They possibly had a greater reliance on gathering wild foods rather than cultivating crops. This <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the drier climate of western Oklahoma compared to the more easterly Paoli and Washita phases.
