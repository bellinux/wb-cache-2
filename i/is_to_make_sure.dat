5|$|Soul Rangers, {{players who}} have failed to become Harbingers, are {{described}} as miserable, skeletal scavengers, the scourge of The Other Side. Soul Rangers hunt down other players and steal their keystones. Soul Rangers were created during the game's development. Brett Clements wanted to introduce characters that players {{did not want to}} become, but he later found that players enjoyed the anarchic role of the Soul Ranger. The final character in the game is the Gatekeeper, whose job <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the other characters cannot escape from The Other Side to the real world. The Gatekeeper's character is based on the old cemetery gatekeepers, whose job was to guard cemeteries from grave robbers.|$|E

Her main goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> everyone is happy, particularly her daughter Alice. She is a main character.|$|E
25|$|The Water Replenishment District of Southern California (WRD), {{in service}} since 1959, {{is one of}} the more {{aggressive}} agencies that use recycled water for their groundwater replenishment and seawater intrusion barriers. To prevent seawater contamination of their groundwater, they have several sets of injection wells that inject clean water between their aquifer and the sea. This creates a local water barrier to seawater intrusion. The other mechanism <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the water level is above sea level.|$|E

No, I can't tell you that I'm going to have that permit until June, but we need to plan like we're going to have that permit in June.

25|$|In the Letter, Rousseau {{rejected}} the traditional notion of male politicians {{being responsible for}} moral reform, {{and thought it was}} women's responsibility. He considered women, by virtue of their nature, to be the primary agents of moral reform, and that the success of the state depends on the harmony within private, domestic life. Rousseau opposed marriage without love (i.e. marriage for financial reasons, order, lust, convenience). In Rousseau's opinion, true love for the nurturing, feminine mother, instead of lustful love for a mistress, {{goes hand in hand with}} patriotism and civic harmony. The legislator's task <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> a society's women are in order.|$|E
25|$|Each bishop has a {{territory}} (see) over which he governs. His main duty <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the traditions {{and practices of}} the Church are preserved. Bishops are equal in authority and cannot interfere in the jurisdiction of another bishop. Administratively, these bishops and their territories are organized into various autocephalous groups or synods of bishops who gather together {{at least twice a}} year to discuss the state of affairs within their respective sees. While bishops and their autocephalous synods have the ability to administer guidance in individual cases, their actions do not usually set precedents that affect the entire Church. Bishops are almost always chosen from the monastic ranks and must remain unmarried.|$|E

This <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that someone with the surname of Brown becomes resident to lure thieves {{to the house to}} steal something they think the real Mrs Brown possesses. This repeats the plot of the 1923 short story The Adventure of the Cheap Flat (published in book form in Poirot Investigates in 1924) where a couple called Robinson are cheaply let a flat in order that they act as decoys for two spies who are in fear of their lives and who were living under the alias of Mr and Mrs Robinson.|$|E
25|$|A way {{for making}} {{formulae}} referring to different worlds not interacting {{in the wrong}} way <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that all formulae of a branch refer to the same world. This condition is initially true as all formulae in the set to be checked for consistency are assumed referring to the same world. When expanding a branch, two situations are possible: either the new formulae refer to the same world as the other one in the branch or not. In the first case, the rule is applied normally. In the second case, all formulae of the branch that do not also hold {{in the new world}} are deleted from the branch, and possibly added to all other branches that are still relative to the old world.|$|E
25|$|The Unit {{was founded}} in January 2008 and is a {{collaborative}} venture between the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust and Lancaster University. It is funded by the UK National Health Service through the National Institute for Health Research. The unit has two aims. The first is to conduct research in patient safety. The second <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the unit's findings are used in practice, to improve the welfare of people in North Lancashire and South Cumbria and throughout the National Health Service. In June 2010 the Unit's director, Professor Andrew Smith, helped launch The Helsinki Declaration for Patient Safety in Anaesthesiology, a practical manifesto aimed at improving the safety of anaesthesia care throughout Europe. He {{is now part of}} a joint European Society of Anaesthesiology/European Board of Anaesthesiology Task Force overseeing the implementation of the Declaration.|$|E

25|$|Each league's roster {{consists}} of 30players, though {{the actual number}} of players on gameday may be less due to call-ups, injuries, or players choosing not to participate. Thirteen players are elected for each team through a vote by fans, team personnel, and media members. Fans can submit online ballots with votes for one player at each infield position, a catcher, a designated hitter, three outfielders, and four pitchers—two starters and two relievers. Fan balloting accounts for one-third of the total vote. The ballots of each club's field manager, coaches, and general manager account for another third. Votes from broadcasters and members of the media make up the final third. Once 13All-Stars are elected, each league office selects an additional 17players to fill out their roster. One goal of adding these additional players <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> every Triple-A team is represented on the All-Star rosters.|$|E
25|$|Each row of {{the band}} has one Squad Leader, and one Assistant Squad Leader, with {{exception}} of J row which has two Assistants. The role of the Squad Leaders <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> their respective rows are at rehearsal on time, take attendance for the row, and make sure all members in the row are striving for their best during each rehearsal and performance. Squad Leaders also run Friday music checks and game day uniform and instrument inspections, as well as judge the row challenges on Mondays. The Squad Leaders must also try out for the band, typically during {{the week before the}} rest of the band does their tryouts. Squad Leaders have been cut from the band in past years. In this case, the Assistant would become Head Squad Leader, and one of the highest scoring returning band members would be offered the position of Assistant.|$|E
25|$|Web 2.0 {{is used by}} companies, {{non-profit}} {{organizations and}} governments for interactive marketing. A growing number of marketers are using Web 2.0 tools to collaborate with consumers on product development, customer service enhancement, product or service improvement and promotion. Companies can use Web 2.0 tools to improve collaboration with both its business partners and consumers. Among other things, company employees have created wikis—Web sites that allow users to add, delete, and edit content— to list answers to frequently asked questions about each product, and consumers have added significant contributions. Another marketing Web 2.0 lure <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> consumers can use the online community to network among themselves on topics of their own choosing. Mainstream media usage of Web 2.0 is increasing. Saturating media hubs—like The New York Times, PC Magazine and Business Week— with links to popular new Web sites and services, is critical to achieving the threshold for mass adoption of those services. User web content {{can be used to}} gauge consumer satisfaction. In a recent article for Bank Technology News, Shane Kite describes how Citigroup's Global Transaction Services unit monitors social media outlets to address customer issues and improve products. According to Google Timeline, the term Web 2.0 was discussed and indexed most frequently in 2005, 2007 and 2008. Its average use is continuously declining by 2–4% per quarter since April 2008.|$|E

Roode was whipped twice during the encounter; the first when he was thrown to the ringside area, while the second was when he fell to the outside. LAX won the match at 10 minutes and 6 seconds when Hernandez pinned Roode following LAX's signature 5150 tag team maneuver.|$|E
500|$|In January 2007, Brunner {{proposed}} {{a plan that}} would allow counties to recruit poll workers by mail, who would then undertake two paid training days, and work a paid eight-hour shift at the polls on Election Day. Brunner explained the plan in an interview: [...] "In terms of Ohio and what happened in the 2004 presidential election, there has been a crisis in confidence in our election system in Ohio, both nationally and in our state. One of the quickest ways to repair that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that we have adequate numbers of poll workers. ... We suggested this as one tool that the boards of elections would have available to them for recruiting poll workers. We would be looking to do this similar to how we recruit jurors, only jurors are recruited for two weeks of service whereas we'd only be asking for three days. It would also allow us to offer split shifts to poll workers. In Ohio the polling places are open for thirteen hours, so essentially a poll worker works at least fourteen hours; with the average age of our poll workers at 72, that's a tough day for anyone, no matter what their age is. ... It's an option, and we can even include a trigger, so that a county has to be deficient by a certain percentage of poll workers to even be able to use this." [...] In the initial proposal it was not yet decided what wages would be paid, and whether refusing recruitment would result in penalties. The proposal will be decided by the Ohio General Assembly.|$|E
