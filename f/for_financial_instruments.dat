50|$|In {{an effort}} to reduce capital controls, {{negotiations}} between Japan and the United States were held, producing an agreement in 1984, the Yen-Dollar Accord. This agreement led to additional liberalising measures that were implemented over the next several years. Many of these changes concerned the establishment and functioning of markets <b>for</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> in Japan (such as a short-term treasury bill market) rather than the removal of international capital controls per se. This approach was taken because of United States concerns that foreign investment in Japan was impeded by a lack of various financial instruments in the country and by the government's continued control of interest rates for many of those instruments that did exist. As a result of the agreement, for example, interest rates on large bank deposits were decontrolled, and the minimum denomination for certificates of deposit was lowered.|$|E

5000|$|To {{strike the}} balance between {{reliability}} and relevance, some scholars propose a double-disclosure—fair-value measurement backed up by historical cost figures: [...] "The best {{way to ensure that}} regulators, investors, and the market at large have a full understanding of banks’ true financial conditions is to include changes in the value of financial instruments over time in financial statements, along with historical cost figures."In fact, FASB is not planning to abandon historical cost accounting for financialinstruments held for collection or payment of contractual cash flows, because it provides useful information about the potential cash flows associated with these financial instruments. Indeed, the difference between amortized cost and fair value captures the expectedimpact of current economic conditions on existing financial instruments. FASB is recommending <b>for</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> held for collection orpayment of contractual cash flows that amortized cost and fair value information be given equal prominence on the financial statements and, thus, that both measures be made available for these financial instruments in public releases of financial reporting information. This dual presentation in financial statements — which some investors have asked for—would ensure that both relevant measures are given adequate attention by banks and their auditors.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{changes in}} {{accounting}} regulation <b>for</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> (SFAS 133, IAS 39) have been heavily criticized by {{representatives from the}} banking industry. They argue for retaining a historical cost based "mixed model" where accounting <b>for</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> depends on their designation to either trading or nontrading activities. In order to demonstrate the impact of different accounting models <b>for</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> on the financial statements of banks, we develop a bank simulation model capturing the essential characteristics of a modern universal bank with investment banking and commercial banking activities. In our simulations we look at different scenarios with periods of increasing/decreasing interest rates using historical data and with different banking strategies (fully hedged; partially hedged). The financial statements of our model bank are prepared under different accounting rules ("Old" IAS before implementation of IAS 39; current IAS) with and without hedge accounting as offered by the respective sets of rules. The paper identifies critical issues of applying the different accounting rules <b>for</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> to the activities of a universal bank. It demonstrates important shortcomings of the "Old" IAS rules (before IAS 39), and of the current IAS rules. Under the current IAS rules {{the results of a}} fully hedged bank may have to show volatility in income statements due to changes in market interest rates. Accounting results of a partially hedged bank in the same scenario may be less affected even though there are economic gains or losses...|$|E
