500|$|Following {{the death}} of Nirvana {{frontman}} Kurt Cobain in April 1994, drummer Dave Grohl entered a state of depression, and {{found it difficult to}} both listen to music and play instruments. He was uncertain of what to do next, even considering abandoning his musical career despite a few invitations by bands such as Danzig or Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers to become their drummer, because [...] "it would just remind me of being in Nirvana; every time <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a drum set, I would think of that." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Hecht biographer, William MacAdams, [...] "At dawn on Sunday, February 20, 1939, David Selznick ... and {{director}} Victor Fleming shook Hecht awake to inform {{him he was}} on loan from MGM and must come with them immediately {{and go to work}} on Gone with the Wind, which Selznick had begun shooting five weeks before. It was costing Selznick $50,000 each day the film was on hold waiting for a final screenplay rewrite and time was of the essence. Hecht {{was in the middle of}} working on the film At the Circus for the Marx Brothers. Recalling the episode in a letter to screenwriter friend Gene Fowler, he said he hadn't read the novel but Selznick {{and director}} Fleming could not wait for him to read it. They would act out scenes based on Sidney Howard's original script which needed to be rewritten in a hurry. Hecht wrote, [...] "After each scene had been performed and discussed, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the typewriter and wrote it out. Selznick and Fleming, eager to continue with their acting, kept hurrying me. We worked in this fashion for seven days, putting in eighteen to twenty hours a day. Selznick refused to let us eat lunch, arguing that food would slow us up. He provided bananas and salted peanuts ... thus on the seventh day I had completed, unscathed, the first nine reels of the Civil War epic." ...|$|E
500|$|Besides {{working on}} the Dictionary, Johnson also wrote {{numerous}} essays, sermons, and poems during these nine years. In 1750, he decided to produce a series of essays under the title The Rambler that were to be published every Tuesday and Saturday and sell for twopence each. Explaining the title years later, he told his friend, the painter Joshua Reynolds: [...] "I {{was at a loss}} how to name it. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> night upon my bedside, and resolved that I would not go to sleep till I had fixed its title. The Rambler seemed the best that occurred, and I took it." [...] These essays, often on moral and religious topics, tended to be more grave than the title of the series would suggest; his first comments in The Rambler were to ask [...] "that in this undertaking thy Holy Spirit may not be withheld from me, but that I may promote thy glory, and the salvation of myself and others." [...] The popularity of The Rambler took off once the issues were collected in a volume; they were reprinted nine times during Johnson's life. Writer and printer Samuel Richardson, enjoying the essays greatly, questioned the publisher as to who wrote the works; only he and a few of Johnson's friends were told of Johnson's authorship. One friend, the novelist Charlotte Lennox, includes a defence of The Rambler in her novel The Female Quixote (1752). In particular, the character Mr. Glanville says, [...] "you may sit in Judgment upon the Productions of a Young, a Richardson, or a Johnson. Rail with premeditated Malice at the Rambler; and for the want of Faults, turn even its inimitable Beauties into Ridicule." [...] (Book VI, Chapter XI) Later, she claims Johnson as [...] "the greatest Genius in the present Age." ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{and wrote}} <b>at</b> once, and {{the burden of}} my letter was: [...] "Be more explicit, Sire. What manner of {{dispatch}} is it your will that Escovedo should be given?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{letters to}} the lawyer and to Mr. Fairlie were still to be written, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> once without a moment's {{hesitation}} to devote myself to them.|$|E

60|$|After I had eaten, I {{attempted}} {{to walk again}} out of doors with my gun; but was so weak, that <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> and looked <b>at</b> the sea, which was smooth and calm. While I continued here, these thoughts came into my mind.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> alone <b>at</b> {{the window}} to wait through the crisis of my life. My mind in that breathless {{interval}} felt like a total blank. I was conscious of nothing but a painful intensity of all familiar perceptions. The sun grew blinding bright, the white sea birds chasing each other far beyond me seemed to be flitting before my face, the mellow murmur of the waves on the beach was like thunder in my ears.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the window, where I {{could just}} discover, {{here and there}} between the trees, the glimmer of {{the waters of the}} lake. I thought to myself: [...] "Thus far my mortal journey has brought me. Why not end it here?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> my desk; I hid {{my face in}} {{my hands}} to keep out all {{impressions}} of external and present things; and I searched back through the mysterious labyrinth of the Past, through the dun, ever-deepening twilight of the years that were gone.|$|E
60|$|I {{began in}} that dexterous, insinuating manner of which I am truly proud. I thought madame was ill. Ah, no. A change, then, {{was all that}} was required. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the piano and sang. In a few minutes madame retired. I was alone with my friend.|$|E
60|$|I {{had already}} learnt {{that it was}} folly to argue with a Spanish guard, and, drawing back my head, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down.</b> But, looking <b>at</b> my watch, I {{saw that it was}} only ten. I should never again have a chance of {{inspecting}} the eyebrows of Joseph of Arimathea unless I chartered a special train, so, seizing the opportunity and my bag, I jumped out.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> rather {{astonished}} <b>at</b> {{the sudden}} change. I don't know that I liked Maloney better under this new aspect. The murderer had, it is true, disappeared for the nonce, {{but there was}} something in the smooth tones and obsequious manner which powerfully suggested the witness of the queen, who had stood up and sworn away the lives of his companions in crime.|$|R
5000|$|... "I always fancied {{the idea}} of writing a book, and I was bored on the road, so <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and started <b>at</b> page one!

60|$|On {{the first}} day, I began {{business}} {{by looking for}} two hours at the sea, and staring the Foreign Militia out of countenance. Having disposed of these important engagements, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{one of the two}} windows of my room, intent on doing something desperate in the way of literary composition, and writing a chapter of unheard-of excellence - with which the present essay has no connexion.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> once {{to write}} the letter, expressing myself in it as civilly, as clearly, and as briefly as possible. Mr. Fairlie did not hurry his reply.

It was written with {{beautiful}} regularity and neatness of character, in violet-coloured ink, on note-paper as smooth as ivory and almost as thick as cardboard, and it addressed me in these terms-- ...|$|E
60|$|I was checked {{suddenly}} by my eye falling {{a second}} time on that terrific African savage sending from his revolver a charge down the throat of that magnificent Bengal tiger, that would have blown the inside entirely out of any living creature smaller than an elephant. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down.</b> <b>I</b> gazed <b>at</b> the picture. I read the account. I followed up the adventurous savage. My head reeled with excitement. A strange terrible heat seemed to dart like lightning through my veins, and the book began to flicker before my eyes. I became alarmed.|$|R
60|$|I {{rose and}} walked out on the gallery with {{surprising}} steadiness. A great cushioned chair had been placed there and beside it a table with books, and another chair. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down.</b> Lindy looked <b>at</b> me sharply, but I did not heed her, and presently she retired. The day, still in its early golden glory, seemed big with prescience. Above, the saffron haze was lifted, {{and there was the}} blue sky. The breeze held its breath; the fragrance of grass and fruit and flowers, of the shrub that vied with all, languished on the air. Out of these things she came.|$|R
5000|$|After his {{international}} {{debut in}} 1991 against Germany, Giggs missed 18 consecutive friendly games before finally {{making his first}} friendly appearance for Wales against Finland in March 2000, by which time he had already accrued 25 caps. The reason for his continued absence from non-competitive fixtures was largely a protective measure against unnecessary injuries; in his autobiography, Giggs states: [...] "At that time, whenever I played two games in one week I always seemed to pick up an injury, so Ferguson and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and looked <b>at</b> it game by game. If the international was a friendly, the feeling was that I didn't have to play." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{bowed and}} withdrew. Then as I lit my pipe and resumed my seat it {{suddenly}} {{occurred to me}} that the man who was chiefly concerned in this matter should at least be warned. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> my desk and wrote to Ray. I had scarcely finished when I heard footsteps outside, followed by an imperious knocking at my front door. I opened it at once. The Duke and Lady Angela entered. I saw at once from her disturbed expression that something had happened.|$|E
60|$|Walking {{on the sea}} front at Worthing one late {{afternoon}} in late November, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{one end of a}} seat in a shelter, the other end being occupied by a lady in black, and between us, drawn close up to the seat, was a perambulator in which a little girl was seated. She looked at me, as little girls always do, with that question--What are you? in her large grey intelligent eyes. The expression tempted me to address her, and I said I hoped she was quite well.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{supposed}} that I earn his money before I buy my salt with it," [...] returned her father, severely. [...] "And in these times, when money is got in heaps, through the natural decay of our nefarious commercialism, it behooves a gentleman to be scrupulous that the hospitality offered him {{is not the}} profusion of a thief with his booty. I don't say that Mr. Dryfoos's good-fortune is not honest. I simply say that I know nothing about it, and that I should prefer to know something before <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his board." ...|$|E
60|$|I found Marian {{waiting for}} me alone in the little sitting-room. She had persuaded Laura to go to rest, after first {{promising}} to show me her drawing the moment I came in. The poor little dim faint sketch--so trifling in itself, so touching in its associations--was propped up carefully {{on the table with}} two books, and was placed where the faint light of the one candle we allowed ourselves might fall on it to the best advantage. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to look <b>at</b> the drawing, and to tell Marian, in whispers, what had happened. The partition which divided us from the next room was so thin that we could almost hear Laura's breathing, and we might have disturbed her if we had spoken aloud.|$|R
2500|$|Michael Chabon, in his {{afterword}} to his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay, {{a fictional}} account of two early comics pioneers, wrote, [...] "I want {{to acknowledge the}} deep debt I owe in this and everything else I've ever written {{to the work of}} the late Jack Kirby, the King of Comics." [...] Director James Cameron said Kirby inspired the look of his film Aliens, calling it [...] "not intentional in the sense <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and looked <b>at</b> all my favorite comics and studied them for this film, but, yeah, Kirby's work was definitely in my subconscious programming. The guy was a visionary. Absolutely. And he could draw machines like nobody's business. He was sort of like A. E. van Vogt and some of these other science-fiction writers who are able to create worlds that— even though we live in a science-fictionary world today— are still so far beyond what we're experiencing." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he closed}} the door on me, and I heard his {{footsteps}} recrossing the corridor and presently ascending some stairs. I was left alone in a small, sparsely furnished room, dimly lighted by an oil lamp which hung down from the ceiling. There was a table {{in the middle of the}} room, a square of carpet on the floor, and a couple of chairs beside a small iron stove. I noticed that the single window was closely shuttered and barred. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and waited. <b>At</b> first the silence around me was only broken by the pattering of the rain against the shutters and the soughing of the wind down the iron chimney pipe, but after a little while my senses, which by this time had become super-acute, were conscious of various noises within the house itself: footsteps overhead, a confused murmur of voices, and anon the unmistakable sound of a female voice raised as if in entreaty or in complaint.|$|R
6000|$|But, sometimes, when I {{took her}} up, {{and felt that}} she was lighter in my arms, a dead blank feeling came upon me, as if I were {{approaching}} to some frozen region yet unseen, that numbed my life. I avoided the recognition of this feeling by any name, or by any communing with myself; until one night, when it was very strong upon me, and my aunt had left her with a parting cry of 'Good night, Little Blossom,' <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> my desk alone, and cried to think, Oh what a fatal name it was, and how the blossom withered in its bloom upon the tree! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the open}} window. It {{was at the}} back of the house, and looked out on a strip of garden--London garden--a close-shut dungeon for nature, where stunted trees and {{drooping}} flowers seemed visibly pining for the free air and sunlight of the country, in their sooty atmosphere, amid their prison of high brick walls. But the place gave room for the air to blow in it, and distanced the tumult of the busy streets. The moon was up, shined round tenderly by a little border-work of pale yellow light. Elsewhere, the awful void of night was starless; the dark lustre of space shone without a cloud.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{that stuff}} you gave me!" [...] said Chunk, {{broadening}} his grin; [...] "well, {{it was this}} way. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the supper table last night at Riddle's, and I looked at Rosy, and I says to myself, 'Chunk, {{if you get the}} girl get her on the square--don't try any hocus-pocus with a thoroughbred like her.' And I keeps the paper you give me in my pocket. And then my lamps fall on another party present, who, I says to myself, is failin' in a proper affection toward his comin' son-in-law, so I watches my chance and dumps that powder in old man Riddle's coffee--see?" ...|$|E
6000|$|At last I saw {{close to}} me a little hill covered with dark fir trees; I came nearer, and the sight of the sombre green was like a draught of cool water. I could no longer bear the horror of the heat. From the main road another smaller one led winding up the hill. I turned my horse, and soon we were among the trees, and I took a long breath of delight in the coolness. I {{dismounted}} and led him by the bridle; it was enchanting to walk along the path, soft with the fallen needles, and a delicious green smell hovered in the air. We came to a clearing, where was a little pond; I watered the poor beast, and, throwing myself down, drank deeply. Then I tied him to a tree and advanced a few steps alone. I came to a sort of terrace, and going forward found myself {{at the edge of the}} hill, looking over the plain. Behind, the tall fir trees gave me shade and coolness; <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> looking <b>at</b> the country before me. In the cloudless sky it seemed now singularly beautiful. Far away on one side I could see the walls and towers of some city, and to it in broad curves wound a river; the maze and corn, vines and olive trees, covered the land, and in the distance I saw the soft blue mountains. Why should the world be so beautiful, and I so miserable? ...|$|R
60|$|It is said that, {{a list of}} {{the summer}} {{vegetables}} which are exhibited on New York hotel tables being shown to a French artiste, he declared that to serve such a dinner properly would take till midnight. I recollect how I was once struck with our national plenteousness on returning from a Continental tour, and going directly from the ship to a New York hotel, in the bounteous season of autumn. For months I had been habituated to my neat little bits of chop or poultry garnished with the inevitable cauliflower or potato, which seemed to be the sole possibility after the reign of green peas was over. Now <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> all <b>at</b> once to a carnival of vegetables,--ripe, juicy tomatoes, raw or cooked; cucumbers in brittle slices; rich, yellow sweet potatoes; broad Lima-beans, and beans of other and various names; tempting ears of Indian corn steaming in enormous piles, and great smoking tureens of the savory succotash, an Indian gift to the table for which civilization need not blush; sliced egg-plant in delicate fritters; and marrow squashes, of creamy pulp and sweetness: a rich variety, embarrassing to the appetite, and perplexing to the choice. Verily, the thought has often impressed itself on my mind that the vegetarian doctrine preached in America left a man quite as much as he had capacity to eat or enjoy, and that in the midst of such tantalizing abundance he really lost the apology which elsewhere bears him out in preying upon his less gifted and accomplished animal neighbors.|$|R
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, here is {{the article}} 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph: A couple of years ago, my wife gave me a book about my {{childhood}} hometown of Richland, Washington, a small desert city where I haven’t lived {{for more than twenty}} years. The book, a pleasantly slim volume simply titled Richland, is one in a series of photographic histories of communities around the United States published by Arcadia Publishing. Like all of Arcadia’s books, Richland is packed full of photographs, and its pages showed many of the buildings, neighborhoods, and desert landscapes that I had known intimately as a child but had mostly forgotten about after so many years. I was surprised, when <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to look <b>at</b> the book for the first time, to find myself filled with an intense nostalgia for a place I was always yearning to leave as a child. For hours that day I flipped through the pages, moving backward and forward, letting one visual cue after another spark memories from my childhood. I simply couldn’t put the book down. When we went to visit my brother, he too was quickly charmed by what he saw and we embarked on a lengthy remembrance of our shared past...|$|R
