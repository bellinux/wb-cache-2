2500|$|Simpson {{embraced a}} {{combination}} of both conservative and radical ideas in his social and political philosophy. He generally disliked banks because of the paper money they issued, regarding it as among the fundamental reasons for the workers' degradation, maintaining that banking enabled the rich to [...] "extort labor upon their own terms of bare subsistence", that banks [...] "levied a tax directly upon every commodity produced by labour; which tax became immediately absorbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> the capitalists".|$|E
2500|$|Laura's cake is {{complete}} {{but she is}} not happy. It is less than she had hoped it would be. She had invested great and desperate hopes in the cake, like an artist working on a great piece of art, and in her mind, she failed. Laura catalogues what she will do to keep busy {{for the rest of the}} day: prepare for Dan's party. She knows Dan will be happy with whatever she prepares. This slightly annoys her. She realises her husband's happiness [...] "depends only on the fact of her, here in the house, living her life, thinking of him". She tries to tell herself this is a good thing and that she is being difficult but is suddenly hit by the image of Virginia Woolf putting a stone <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> her coat and walking into a river. This psychic connection to another ‘desperate housewife’ is interrupted by a tap on the back door.|$|E

60|$|He eyed me {{with one}} of his blackest looks, and thrust his hands savagely <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> his riding-coat.|$|R
60|$|The Demon did not reply. He was busily {{forcing the}} various {{electrical}} devices that Rob had relinquished <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> his fiery jacket.|$|R
60|$|Huxter arose {{with great}} {{perturbation}} at this news, and plunged his stick <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> his paletot, and seized his hat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't shoot!" [...] she cried, as Mr. Peters absent-mindedly dipped {{his hand}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> his coat. [...] "Oh, please don't shoot!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Not one drop,’ replied my father; ‘and if {{you find}} {{yourself}} in want, let me counsel you to put your hand <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> your coat.’ ...|$|E
60|$|They {{were silent}} for some minutes. Norah shivered, and thrust her hands deep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> her jacket. Lorison uttered a remorseful exclamation.|$|R
60|$|She {{stuck her}} hands deeply <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> her dust-coat, and a china-blue eye {{regarded}} Melville {{from under the}} brim of the boldly trimmed bonnet.|$|R
60|$|Dr. Monygham {{slipped off}} the window-sill, and, {{thrusting}} his hands <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long, grey dust coat he was wearing, made a few steps <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not lost, Little Flower. I see it; {{you have}} it now. Put your hand <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> your dress. What do you find there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Gracedieu's {{object was}} to consult me--" [...] Before I {{could say the}} next words, I saw him put his hand <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> his dressing-gown.|$|E
6000|$|Chauvelin {{gave him}} no direct reply. He was busy {{collecting}} his precious papers together and thrusting them back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> his coat. Then he said quietly: ...|$|E
60|$|Jimmy did {{not stop}} to consider. He knew that every dollar the {{schooner}} brought now would go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> his father, {{and that was enough}} for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll go {{back and}} be damned to it!" [...] said the captain recklessly, {{plunging}} his hands <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> his pea jacket and plumping back into his chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I am too late," [...] said Phineas, {{and putting}} his hands <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> his coat, {{he turned his}} back upon her, and walked away across the mountain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not one drop," [...] replied my father; [...] "and if {{you find}} {{yourself}} in want, let me counsel you to put your hand <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> your coat." ...|$|E
60|$|Prince Shan's fingers stole <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> his coat. He {{held out}} a {{crumpled}} sheet of paper, on which was written a single sentence. The girl began to shiver.|$|E
6000|$|... "An insult!" [...] she answered, {{crushing}} {{the paper in}} her hand and then stuffing it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> her dress. [...] "Light your pipe, daddy, dear. Here--I'll strike the match." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} more to be said. Lord Rufton sat moodily in the corner with his brows drawn down and his hands thrust deep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> his riding-breeches.|$|R
5000|$|A {{report by}} The Sentry categorizes {{corruption}} in South Sudan {{in a slightly}} different way, identifying the following four main methods the nation's wealth is diverted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> elites: ...|$|R
5000|$|All {{four corners}} are folded {{up so that}} the points meet in the middle, and the player works their fingers <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> paper {{in each of the}} four corners.|$|R
60|$|Slipping the key <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> his {{tunic and}} {{covering}} the bundle {{with his long}} surcoat, De Vac {{stepped out into the}} darkness of the alley and hastened toward the dock.|$|E
60|$|Outside, the sea-mist {{was white}} and woolly. They went hand in hand. It was cold, so she thrust her hand with his <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> his overcoat, while they walked together.|$|E
60|$|He {{went past}} Clara without speaking. She felt the three {{chocolate}} creams would burn {{her if she}} touched them. It needed all her courage to slip them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> her apron.|$|E
5000|$|Examples {{include the}} {{misdirection}} of company funds into [...] "shadow companies" [...] (and then <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> corrupt employees), <b>the</b> skimming {{of foreign aid}} money, scams and other corrupt activity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will you run over, once again, {{what the}} boy said?" [...] asks Mr. Tulkinghorn, putting his hands <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> his rusty smallclothes and leaning quietly {{back in his}} chair.|$|R
60|$|Larry plunged {{both hands}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> his trousers, and pulled them forth full of half and quarter dollars, {{with a few}} shining little nuggets of gold {{interspersed}} among them.|$|R
6000|$|Imogene {{lifted her}} head at last, and softly dried her eyes. Then, as she pushed her {{handkerchief}} back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> her robe, [...] "What sort of looking girl was that other one?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, you don't," [...] {{said the}} man, {{and put the}} {{sovereign}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> his trousers, which were of a corduroy material. [...] "Now," [...] said he, [...] "what am I do to earn this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{what did}} I tell you of him?" [...] he asked, rejoicing, as they started: a {{question}} for all answer to which, before she took his arm, the girl thrust her paper, crumpled, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> her coat.|$|E
60|$|This we stuffed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> our shirts; filled our powder-horns and bullet-pouches {{from the}} {{ammunition}} {{on the dead}} bodies, {{and then we were}} ready to leave that valley of death.|$|R
60|$|She {{spoke with}} energy, {{but in a}} matter-of-fact tone. Razumov's {{attention}} had wandered away on a track of its own--outside {{the bars of the}} gate--but not out of earshot. He stuck his hands <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> his coat.|$|R
5000|$|In the Gulf Cartel, Cárdenas Vela {{made more}} than $5 million and ensured that that money [...] "went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> Mexican law {{enforcement}} officers as bribes," [...] and had about [...] "500 armed men at his beck and call." ...|$|R
