5|$|Only Lion was {{completed}} {{to the original}} design, which had the fore funnel placed between the forward superstructure and the tripod <b>foremast.</b> This meant that hot clinkers and flue gases from the boilers made the spotting top on the <b>foremast</b> completely unworkable when the ships were steaming at high speed, that the upper bridge could easily be rendered uninhabitable, depending on the wind, and that the signal flags and halyards were at risk of burning. Both ships were altered to correct this problem, Lion before being commissioned, and Princess Royal as she was fitting out, at a total cost of £68,170. The fore funnel was moved aft, the original fore and mainmasts exchanged position, and the <b>foremast</b> was now just a pole mast, not a tripod. The spotting tower {{at the rear of}} the conning tower was removed, the conning tower enlarged, the nine-foot Argo rangefinder was moved from the <b>foremast</b> spotting top to the roof of the conning tower, and all the funnels were raised to the same height. As part of these modifications, the two 4-inch guns mounted above the forward group of casemates were enclosed in casemates of their own to protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.|$|E
5|$|The Mahans {{typically}} had {{a tripod}} <b>foremast</b> with a pole mainmast. To improve the anti-aircraft field of fire, their tripod <b>foremast</b> was constructed without nautical rigging. In silhouette, they {{were similar to}} the larger s that immediately preceded them. The Mahans were fitted with the first emergency generators, replacing the storage batteries of earlier classes. Gun crew shelters were built for the superimposed weapons, one shelter before the bridge and one atop the shelter deck aft.|$|E
5|$|Dreadnoughts tripod <b>foremast</b> was {{positioned}} behind the forward funnel {{to allow the}} vertical leg {{to serve as a}} support for the boat-handling derrick. This meant that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable in conditions of little or no wind. The Bellerophons had the <b>foremast</b> moved forward of the funnels to reduce the problem in the spotting top and a second tripod mast was added to handle the derrick, but it had to be positioned in front of the aft funnel to do that, which rendered the aft spotting top almost useless as it could be exposed to the exhaust plumes from both funnels under certain circumstances.|$|E

60|$|That laugh was a {{tactical}} error. It spurred Asad. He advanced {{slowly along the}} vessel's waist-deck to the mainmast--for she was rigged with main and <b>foremasts.</b> There he halted again {{to look into the}} face of Sakr-el-Bahr who stepped along beside him.|$|R
500|$|The {{ships of}} the Regina Elena class were [...] long at the {{waterline}} and [...] long overall. They had {{a beam of}} [...] and a draft of [...] They displaced [...] at normal loading and up to [...] at full combat load. The ships had a crew of 742764officers and enlisted men. The ships were initially fitted with two masts, but after refits early in their careers, Regina Elenas and Napolis <b>foremasts</b> were removed.|$|R
5|$|During the ship's refit in January 1944, her {{electronics}} were modernized. The CXAM {{was replaced}} by an SK model and the SC-1 {{was replaced by}} an SC-3. The forward SG was supplemented by an additional SG-1 mounted on a short mast at the aft end of the funnel. A lengthier overhaul in mid-1944 provided the opportunity to revise the radar arrangements. The SK radar {{was moved to the}} rebuilt <b>foremast</b> and the forward SG radar was replaced by an SG-1 mounted {{at the top of the}} <b>foremast.</b> An SM-1 fighter-control radar was mounted in the SK's former position and new antennas were added to the FD radars to allow them to determine target height. The SC-3 was replaced by an SC-4 in early 1945.|$|E
5|$|Z38 {{was fitted}} with a FuMO 21 radar on her bridge, and four FuMB 4 Sumatra aerials were placed around the {{searchlight}} platform on her <b>foremast.</b> She had a degaussing coil around her forecastle.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only the}} lower {{fittings}} of the rigging survives, a 1514 inventory {{and the only}} known contemporary depiction of the ship from the Anthony Roll {{have been used to}} determine how the propulsion system of the Mary Rose was designed. Nine, or possibly ten, sails were flown from four masts and a bowsprit: the <b>foremast</b> and mainmast had two and three square sails respectively; the mizzen mast had a lateen sail and a small square sail and the bonaventure mizzen had at least one lateen sail, and possibly also a square sail, and the bowsprit flew a small square spritsail. According to the Anthony Roll illustration (see top of this section), the yards (the spars from which the sails were set) on the <b>foremast</b> and mainmast were also equipped with sheerhooks, twin curved blades sharpened on the inside, that were intended to cut an enemy ship's rigging during boarding actions.|$|E
500|$|During the ships' {{modernization}} {{during the}} 1930s, their forward superstructures were enlarged with multiple platforms added to their tripod <b>foremasts.</b> Both ships were also given torpedo bulges {{to improve their}} underwater protection and {{to compensate for the}} weight of the additional armour. In addition, their sterns were lengthened by [...] These changes increased their overall length to , their beam to [...] and their draft to [...] Their displacement increased over [...] to [...] at deep load. The crew now numbered 1,376 officers and enlisted men.|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} elapsed ere Tom and the mate gained {{a place of}} partial {{security}} on the poop. The scene that met their gaze there was terrible beyond description. Not far ahead the sea roared in irresistible fury on a reef of rocks, towards which the ship was slowly drifting. The {{light of the moon}} was just sufficient to show that a few of the men were still clinging to the rail of the forecastle, and that the rigging of the main and <b>foremasts</b> still held fast.|$|R
5|$|The {{survivors}} were refitted {{several times}} during the interwar period to remedy these issues, although no comprehensive modernisation was ever planned. These included installation of director control mounted in new tripod <b>foremasts,</b> replacement of the rangefinders by larger units, the addition of more rangefinders, the alteration of the main gun turrets to allow elevation up to 23°, partial replacement of the coal-fired boilers by oil-fired units, the replacement of the direct-drive turbines by geared turbines, the removal of the bow armour to reduce the weight forward, and the addition of more modern anti-aircraft guns.|$|R
5|$|Details of the Implacable-class ships' radar suite are {{not readily}} available. They were fitted with the Type 277 surface-search/height-finding radar {{on top of}} the bridge and a Type 293 target {{indicator}} radar on the <b>foremast.</b> , one of the Illustrious-class ships upon which Indefatigables design was based, also carried Type 279 and Type 281B early-warning radars. Type 282 and Type 285 gunnery radars were mounted on the fire-control directors.|$|E
5|$|In 1917–18 the 12-pounder AA gun {{mounted on}} the aft {{superstructure}} {{was moved to the}} roof of the forward 9.2-inch gun turret and a fire-control system was installed with a director mounted on a platform fitted to the <b>foremast.</b> Minotaur was paid off on 5 February 1919, placed on the disposal list in May, put up for sale in March 1920 and sold the following month.|$|E
5|$|Korall radar-jammers were {{mounted on}} either side of the {{mainmast}} as well as a Machta system on the <b>foremast.</b> Solentse-1P infrared detectors were carried {{on either side}} of the superstructure. Fakel-MO and Fakel-MZ antenna comprised the IFF system. A Gerkules sonar was also fitted in addition to various radio direction finders.|$|E
500|$|During the ships' {{modernization}} {{during the}} 1930s, their forward superstructures were enlarged with multiple platforms added to their tripod <b>foremasts.</b> The rear superstructures were rebuilt to accommodate mounts for [...] anti-aircraft (AA) guns and additional fire-control directors.

Their displacement increased over 5000 LT to 42675 t at deep load. The crew now numbered 1,376 officers and enlisted men.|$|R
50|$|In 1844 the Tyne {{was back}} in Port Nicholson. She sailed for London on 23 May for London. In early 1845 she sailed for Port Nicholson from London, {{reaching}} Stephen Island on 3 September she proceeded into Cook Strait near Cape Terawhiti where she encountered a southerly storm. At about 5pm on 4 September she was driven into rocks lossing the main and <b>foremasts.</b> She was then driven ashore. On 6 September soldiers from the 96th Regiment of Foot and the local militia arrived to assist the survivors ashore. No lives were lost.|$|R
5|$|The Conqueror-class {{monitors}} were enlarged {{versions of}} HMS Rupert with improvements based on suggestions {{from one of}} Ruperts captains. The useless <b>foremast</b> was removed, and breech-loading guns and heavier compound armour were added. The rear superstructure was enlarged to better accommodate the crew and secondary armament. Six 14-inch torpedo tubes were fitted above water.|$|E
5|$|Z39s sensor suite {{included}} a FuMO 21 radar, which {{was placed on}} the ship's bridge, and four FuMB4 Sumatra aerials on the <b>foremast</b> searchlights. She also had several other radars, including a FuMB 3 Bali and FuMO 81 Berlin-S on her masthead, and a FuMO 63 Hohentwei. She also had a degaussing cable which wrapped around the entire ship, but was covered by her spray deflector.|$|E
5|$|A Type 271 surface {{search radar}} {{replaced}} the fire-control director and rangefinder above the bridge. A Type 290 surface warning radar was added {{at the top}} of the <b>foremast.</b> A High frequency direction finding system was added on a pole mast aft. The ship also received a Type 242 IFF system. Two 4.7-inch guns were removed, one each forward and aft, and the forward gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar. The 3-inch anti-aircraft gun amidships was also removed, but the number of 20mm AA guns was increased to six.|$|E

50|$|The {{ships of}} the Regina Elena class were 132.6 m long at the {{waterline}} and 144.6 m long overall. They had {{a beam of}} 22.4 m and a draft of 7.91 to 8.58 m. They displaced 12550 to 12658 LT at normal loading and up to 13771 to 13914 LT at full combat load. The ships had a crew of 742 - 764 officers and enlisted men. The ships were initially fitted with two masts, but after refits early in their careers, Regina Elenas and Napolis <b>foremasts</b> were removed.|$|R
60|$|But as {{they reached}} the Peñon and felt the full vigour of that warm breeze, Sakr-el-Bahr, who by Asad's command {{remained}} in charge of the navigation, ordered the unfurling of the enormous lateen sails on main and <b>foremasts.</b> They ballooned out, swelling to the wind, and the galeasse surged forward at a speed that was more than doubled. The order to cease rowing followed, and the slaves were left to return thanks to Heaven for their respite, and to rest in their chains until such time as their sinews should be required again.|$|R
5|$|Bretagne {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Arsenal de Brest on 1 July 1912, {{launched}} on 21 April 1913, and completed in September 1915. She was commissioned into the French Navy on 10 February 1916. After entering service in 1916, Bretagne and her sisters {{were assigned to the}} 1st Division of the 1st Battle Squadron, their unit {{for the remainder of the}} war, Bretagne becoming flagship of the squadron. They spent the majority of their time at Corfu to prevent the Austro-Hungarian fleet from attempting to break out of the Adriatic. The fleet's presence was also intended to intimidate Greece, which had become increasingly hostile to the Triple Entente. Later in the war, men were drawn from their crews for anti-submarine warfare vessels. As the Austro-Hungarians largely remained in port for the duration of the war, Bretagne saw no action during the conflict. Indeed, she did not leave port at all for the entirety of 1917, due to a severe shortage of coal at Corfu. Around July 1918, the ship's <b>foremast</b> was replaced by a tripod <b>foremast</b> that mounted an experimental fire-control director and her mainmast was shortened to allow the ship to fly a captive kite balloon. Bretagne returned to Toulon in November 1918.|$|E
5|$|Early warning {{would have}} been {{provided}} by a Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1 air search radar mounted {{at the top of}} the <b>foremast.</b> A Type 93 passive hydrophone system {{would have been}} fitted in the bow. The ships were designed to carry three aircraft on a platform between the funnel and the mainmast. These would have consisted of one three-seat Aichi E13A and two two-seat Yokosuka E14Y floatplanes. They would have been launched by a pair of aircraft catapults, one on each side of the aircraft platform.|$|E
5|$|Lion {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised the pointing and firing {{of the guns}} {{under the command of}} the director positioned on the <b>foremast.</b> The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers controlled by the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy as it was easier to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells as each turret fired individually.|$|E
50|$|During the ships' {{modernization}} {{during the}} 1930s, their forward superstructures were enlarged with multiple platforms added to their tripod <b>foremasts.</b> The rear superstructures were rebuilt to accommodate mounts for 127 mm anti-aircraft (AA) guns and additional fire-control directors. Both ships were also given torpedo bulges {{to improve their}} underwater protection and {{to compensate for the}} weight of the additional armor. In addition, their sterns were lengthened by 7.62 m. These changes increased their overall length to 212.75 m, their beam to 33.1 m and their draft to 9.69 m. Their displacement increased nearly 4000 LT to 39154 LT at deep load.|$|R
50|$|Pagoda masts {{were built}} on {{existing}} tripod masts by adding platforms, lookouts and shelters upon each other, {{the end result}} resembling a pagoda temple. They featured a mass of platforms that included watch points, searchlights, and spotting points. The superstructures were constructed on {{the majority of the}} ships that were rebuilt by the Japanese, including the Kongō-class battlecruisers and the Fusō, Ise, and Nagato-class battleships. The additional platforms were supported on the ships' original tripod <b>foremasts</b> (a design also extensively used by the Royal Navy) and these were suitably strengthened to bear the extra weight they had to carry.|$|R
25|$|The British {{immediately}} fitted out James Madison for {{the protection}} of the fleet. They put two officers and 40 men on board, drawn from Barbadoes and her existing crew. On 26 August a hurricane came up that scattered the vessels of the convoy. It also totally dis-masted Barbadoes and sprung Polyphemuss main and <b>foremasts.</b> On 3 September an American privateer schooner of 14 guns started shadowing James Madison and the vessels she was escorting. During the subsequent four days the privateer stayed close enough to exchange occasional shots with James Madison, but did not succeed in capturing anything. On 3 October Polyphemus and James Madison arrived separately at Portsmouth.|$|R
5|$|Neptune was {{the first}} British {{dreadnought}} to be built with a gunnery director, albeit an experimental prototype designed by Vice-Admiral Sir Percy Scott. This was mounted on the <b>foremast,</b> underneath the spotting top and electrically provided data to the turrets via pointer on a dial, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised {{the effects of the}} roll on the dispersion of the shells. The ship's director was later replaced as a new one was ordered in 1913 and installed by May 1916.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August Dainty sighted a {{large ship}} heading {{directly}} towards them {{and as it}} drew nearer, its enormous size became apparent. The carrack was far larger than Santa Cruz, fully {{three times the size}} of England's biggest ship. Madre de Deus was attacked by the much smaller Dainty. Around midday Newport's Golden Dragon, followed by Roebuck - bigger than Dainty, but only a fraction of the Madre, joined the fray. These were followed at two-hour intervals by Foresight and Prudence in the evening. The Dainty had her <b>foremast</b> shot away and was out of the battle for five hours.|$|E
5|$|The guns {{on top of}} Cochranes {{centreline}} 9.2-inch turrets {{were removed}} in 1915–16. The aftermost 3-pounder guns on the superstructure were removed during 1917 {{as well as the}} guns on top of the forward 9.2-inch wing turrets. This reduced her total to twenty 3-pounder guns, excluding the AA guns. Cochranes <b>foremast</b> was converted to a tripod mast to support the weight of a fire-control director in 1917, but the director was not actually fitted until August 1918.|$|E
50|$|The British {{immediately}} fitted out James Madison for {{the protection}} of the fleet. They put two officers and 40 men on board, drawn from Barbadoes, and those men of James Madison's existing crew that were willing to change sides. On 26 August a hurricane came up that scattered the vessels of the convoy. It also totally dis-masted Barbadoes, which limped back to Jamaica, and sprung Polyphemus's main and <b>foremasts.</b> James Madison was able to regather 21 vessels of the convoy. On 3 September an American privateer schooner of 14 guns started shadowing James Madison and the vessels she was escorting. During the subsequent four days the privateer stayed close enough to exchange occasional shots with James Madison, but did not succeed in capturing anything. On 3 October Polyphemus and James Madison arrived separately at Portsmouth. Prize money for the capture was payable in March 1815.|$|R
5000|$|In 1909-1911 the ships' {{original}} 8-inch/40 caliber {{guns were}} replaced with four 8 in/45 caliber Mark 6 guns in Mark 12 turrets {{due to a}} gun bursting on Colorado in 1907. From 1911 the military <b>foremasts</b> were replaced with cage masts. In 1911, Pennsylvania was fitted with an after flight deck for the first landing on a ship by an aircraft. This was a one-off demonstration on 18 January 1911 with pilot Eugene Ely, who had performed the first takeoff from a ship on [...] two months earlier. From 1915 to the American entry into World War I in April 1917, Huntington and two Tennessee-class ships had catapults for seaplanes (which disabled the after turret) and carried up to four aircraft; Huntington could also tether an observation balloon, which was used during convoy escort duty in the war. However, by late 1917, the aircraft program was cancelled and the catapults removed.|$|R
50|$|In late 1808, Émeric, ranking Lieutenant, {{served as}} first {{officer on the}} frigate Junon. Under Jean-Baptiste-Augustin Rousseau, he sailed for a cruise from le Havre to Cherbourg, and then {{ferrying}} troops from Cherbourg to Basse-Terre. On 20 December, Junon fought the British 18-gun corvette HMS St Christopher, but did not give chase for fear of lacking wind and exposing himself to the British blockade. Junon arrived at the Saintes in mid-January, and departed on 7 February. The next day, she was detected by the brigs HMS Asp and Supérieure, who shadowed Junon and harassed her. The cannonade {{attracted the attention of}} the frigates HMS Latona and Horatio, who gave chased and started the Action of 10 February 1809. Émeric assumed command when Rousseau was mortally wounded, and fought until his mainmast collapsed; surrounded by three opponents, Émeric struck his colours. The mizeen and <b>foremasts</b> collapsed soon after the ensign had been hoisted down.|$|R
