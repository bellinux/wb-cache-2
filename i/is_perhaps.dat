5|$|Although Jevons {{originally}} {{focused on}} the issue of coal, the concept has since been extended to the use of any resource, including, for example, water usage and interpersonal contact. It <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> the most widely known paradox in environmental economics.|$|E
5|$|Charles Kenneth Horne, {{generally}} {{known as}} Kenneth Horne, (27 February 1907– 14 February 1969) was an English comedian and businessman. He <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> best remembered {{for his work}} on three BBC Radio series: Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh (1944–54), Beyond Our Ken (1958–64) and Round the Horne (1965–68).|$|E
5|$|Communally {{roosting}} birds, the dusky woodswallow has {{a variety}} of chattering calls which are used in certain situations. The most distinctive of these calls <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> the one which is used when a predator or intruder approaches, which consists of a harsh mobbing call to warn others.|$|E

5|$|The best-known {{document}} <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> Tablet 291, written around AD100 from Claudia Severa, {{the wife}} of the commander of a nearby fort, to Sulpicia Lepidina, inviting her to a birthday party. The invitation is one of the earliest known examples of writing in Latin by a woman.|$|E
5|$|Among scientists, he <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> {{best known}} for his work on the {{ligament}} which bears his name. His work on the rare and vestigial Ligament of Struthers {{came to the attention of}} Charles Darwin, who used it in his Descent of Man to help argue the case that man and other mammals shared a common ancestor.|$|E

5|$|Anne Rice (born Howard Allen Frances O'Brien; October 4, 1941) is an American {{author of}} gothic fiction, Christian literature, and erotica. She <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> {{best known for}} her series of novels, The Vampire Chronicles, {{revolving}} around the central character of Lestat. Books from The Vampire Chronicles were the subject of two film adaptations, Interview with the Vampire in 1994, and Queen of the Damned in 2002.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as his}} {{two sons}} Ælfhelm left a daughter, Ælfgifu of Northampton, by a woman named Wulfrun; Ælfgifu's {{territorial}} appellation is taken as further evidence that Ælfhelm had territory in the eastern Danelaw. She <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> more famous than her father, because at some time between 1013 and 1016 she married Cnut, son of Sweyn Forkbeard, future King of the English. Her son was Harold Harefoot, King of the English.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Lee (1908–1981) was an English {{actor who}} {{performed}} in many light entertainment media, including film, television and theatre.

5|$|Building {{a castle}} {{sometimes}} required {{the permission of}} the king or other high authority. In 864 the King of West Francia, Charles the Bald, prohibited the construction of castella without his permission and ordered them all to be destroyed. This <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> the earliest reference to castles, though military historian R. Allen Brown points out that the word castella may have applied to any fortification at the time.|$|E
5|$|Ecgric is a {{possible}} contender, as well as Rædwald, Eorpwald and Sigeberht, for being the East Anglian king who was buried within Mound 1 at Sutton Hoo. Rupert Bruce-Mitford suggests that it <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> unlikely that Ecgric’s successor Anna, a devout Christian, would have given him a ship burial, {{but he does not}} dismiss the theory entirely.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of Argentinean ferugliotheriids {{come from}} the Los Alamitos (Ferugliotherium), La Colonia (Ferugliotherium and Argentodites), and Allen Formations (Trapalcotherium). All three are {{approximately}} the same age, dating to the Campanian (84–71mya) or more likely the Maastrichtian (71–66mya), but the La Colonia Formation <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> a little younger. The Los Alamitos and Allen Formations may have been deposited in a marshy environments, and the depositional environment of the La Colonia Formations {{may have been an}} estuary, tidal flat, or coastal plain.|$|E

Initially small excerpts of the book were released by the authors in the issue of Sports Illustrated. The book alleges Bonds used stanozolol {{and a host of}} other steroids, and <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> most responsible for the change in public opinion regarding Bonds's steroid use.|$|E
5|$|In his {{directorship}} of ACTS, George {{is known}} today as the unofficial leader {{of the men in}} the Army Air Corps who closed ranks and pushed exclusively toward the concept of daylight precision bombing as a strategic, war-winning doctrine. Though he played a fundamental role in the development of U.S. air power strategy, he <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> better known as the first commander of Air Transport Command—the man who guided and expanded that organization throughout World War II.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> no {{accident}} that the factuality of the Italian Renaissance has been most vigorously questioned by those who are not obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization—historians of economic and social developments, political and religious situations, and, most particularly, natural science—but only exceptionally by students of literature and hardly ever by historians of Art.|$|E

Sir William Osler, Wilder Penfield, Donald Hebb, Brenda Milner, and others made significant discoveries in medicine, neuroscience and psychology while working at McGill, many at the University's Montreal Neurological Institute. The first hormone governing the Immune System (later christened the Cytokine 'Interleukin-2') was discovered at McGill in 1965 by Gordon & McLean.|$|E
5|$|Mobile's French and Spanish colonial {{history has}} {{given it a}} culture {{distinguished}} by French, Spanish, Creole, African and Catholic heritage, in addition to later British and American influences. It is distinguished from all other cities {{in the state of}} Alabama. The annual Carnival celebration <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> the best example of its differences. Mobile is the birthplace of the celebration of Mardi Gras in the United States and has the oldest celebration, dating to the early 18th century during the French colonial period.|$|E
5|$|Not listed <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> {{the most}} notable 'acquisition', the 2001 merger with Time Warner to become AOL Time Warner. Due to the larger market {{capitalization}} of AOL, it gained ascendancy in the merger, with its executives largely displacing Time Warner's despite AOL's far smaller assets and revenues. AOL was spun off as its own independent company from Time Warner in 2009.|$|E
