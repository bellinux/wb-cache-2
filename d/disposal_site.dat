In April 1967 Penn State vacated the site and gave the reactor complex to the state. Martin Marietta departed in June 1967, and early in that same year, Pennsylvania bought the remaining land back from Curtiss-Wright for $992,500, about $811,000 more than they had sold it for in 1955. Various usage plans for the area were proposed, including: a vacation resort with a large artificial lake, motels, golf courses, and honeymoon resort; a Penn State game preserve stocked with exotic animals like bison and boar; a large youth camp for several hundred children; and a radioactive waste <b>disposal</b> <b>site.</b> By November 1967, all of the land {{was back in the}} state forests and state game lands.|$|E

40|$|A phytosociological {{study was}} {{conducted}} as an initial assessment of the vegetation on ash <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> {{to determine the community}} structure of vegetation and how the communities were related based on their species composition and habitat characteristics. The Braun-Blanquet survey and data analysis method was used to identify and classify plant communities on ash <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> and an adjacent natural grassland. Relevés were compiled in 113 survey plots. The TWINSPAN classification algorithm was used as first approximation and results were subsequently refined using Braun-Blanquet procedures. The DCA ordination technique was also used to determine the relationship between communities and whether gradients exist in the study area, α-diversity between communities are statistically compared using the Shannon diversity indices and species richness. The natural grassland <b>sites,</b> rehabilitated ash <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> and unrehabilitated ash <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> formed three separate communities. The two sub-communities that are described on rehabilitated ash <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> are distinguished mainly with respect to age of rehabilitation and level of disturbance. Community structure, on a variant level, is largely determined by different treatments (seed mixtures and soil preparations) that were used in the rehabilitation of the ash <b>disposal</b> <b>sites.</b> Plant communities on recently rehabilitated sites are similar to plant communities on dumps of domestic refuse on some of the <b>disposal</b> <b>sites.</b> Based on the variants described, three homogenous areas on the old rehabilitated sites, which were rehabilitated more than three years ago, can be identified. Vegetation is relatively homogenous and variants are closely related. Differences in rehabilitation treatment, age of rehabilitation and man-made disturbances were some of the important factors determining the establishment of different communities on ash <b>disposal</b> <b>sites.</b> Statistically significant differences are found in the diversity of vegetation studied on a community and variant level. Associations on the ash disposal areas are strongly based on the dominance of particular species rather than specific indicator species...|$|R
40|$|The {{disposal}} of waste is a growing environmental, political, and economic problem. Low level radioactive waste (LLW) disposal is no exception. The major purposes of this dissertation are to examine the economic tradeoffs which arise {{in the process of}} LLW disposal and to derive a framework within which the impact of these tradeoffs on LLW disposal policy can be analyzed. There are two distinct stages in the {{disposal of}} LLW [...] the transportation of the waste from sources to <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> and the <b>disposal</b> of the waste. The levels of costs and risks associated with these two stages depend on the number and location of <b>disposal</b> <b>sites.</b> Having more <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> results in lower transportation costs and risks but also in greater disposal costs and risks. The tradeoff between transportation costs and risks can also be viewed as a tradeoff between present and future risks. Therefore, an alteration in the spatial distribution of LLW <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> necessarily implies a change in the temporal distribution of risks. These tradeoffs are examined in this work {{through the use of a}} transportation model to which probabilistic radiation exposure constraints are added. Future (disposal) risks are discounted. The number and capacities of LLW <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> are varied in order to derive a series of system costs and corresponding expected cancers. This provides policymakers with a cost vs. cancers possibility function. The marginal cost of reducing cancers by changing the number and location of <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> is calculated. A possible policy application of this information is illustrated by comparing these costs to an assumed value of life derived from experimental evidence found in the literature. A tentative conclusion is reached that the current movement toward a system of regional LLW <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> may be economically suboptimal...|$|R

25|$|The Energy Policy Act of 1992 had a {{provision}} under Section 801, which directed the EPA to promulgate radiation protection {{standards for the}} Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada. The Yucca Mountain site was then designated {{by the federal government}} to serve as the permanent <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> for used nuclear fuel and other radioactive materials from commercial nuclear power plants and U.S. Department of Defense activities. The costs for this project have reached $13.5billion for this expected 25-year program. However, in 2009, President Barack Obama fulfilled his campaign promise to end the shipping of nuclear waste to the site. Soon after this, the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives passed legislation to back Obama's decision, although the site is still active and being funded by the government ($196.8million in the federal budget). Although Obama has asked the NRC to devise another long-term solution to waste storage of spent fuel rods from nuclear reactors, as yet, none have been proposed, and all radioactive waste is still being stored on-site at nuclear power plants.|$|E

Plans {{to expand the}} landfills in Pelham Bay Park in 1966, which would have created the City’s second-largest refuse <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> next to Fresh Kills in Staten Island, were met with widespread community opposition. The landfill expansion {{was seen as a}} way to alleviate the city's accumulations of waste, and Tallapoosa was seen as the only suitable location to put the landfill. The preservation effort was headed by Dr. Theodore Kazimiroff, a Bronx historian and head of the Bronx Historical Society. It suffered setbacks in August 1967 when the New York City Board of Estimate voted against an initial effort to create to protected area in the proposed landfill expansion site. However, the state and federal governments did not favor the landfill being located at Tallapoosa. On October 11, 1967, Mayor John Lindsay signed a law authorizing in the creation of two wildlife refuges, the Thomas Pell Wildlife Sanctuary and the Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary, on the site where the landfill was planned to be expanded. Tallapoosa West continued {{to be used as a}} landfill until May 1968, when the landfill permit was revoked. In November of that year, Tallapoosa West was made a part of the Pell refuge. The dump still existed as late as 1975, when the garbage there was described as being ten stories high.|$|E
40|$|Phylum-level {{meta-analysis}} {{was applied}} to 192 samples {{from a variety of}} dredgings <b>disposal</b> and relocation <b>sites</b> around the coast of England and Wales. No consistent relationship was found between the disturbance status of macrobenthic communities within <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> and the nature or amount of dredgings disposed. Differences between samples within and outside <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> were generally smaller than differences between different sites and various patterns of impact were detected. It is concluded that dredgings disposal has two contrasting impacts on benthic communities. One, associated with organic enrichment, leads to communities dominated by annelids and nematodes. The other, associated with intense physical disturbance, favours large motile or armoured forms, such as bivalve molluscs and crustaceans. These effects may act antagonistically, and in a phylum-level meta-analysis may cancel each other out. None of the samples examined from offshore <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> was grossly disturbed, in terms of the proportional contribution to production from different phyla, and overall most samples ranged from moderately disturbed to undisturbed. The ecological impacts associated with the intertidal placement of material (beneficial use schemes) were comparable to those observed for the conventional sea <b>disposal</b> <b>sites...</b>|$|R
