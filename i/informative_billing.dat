The increasing number and speeds of internet connections {{can be seen}} as the tool for measuring electricity and consumers’ behaviour on energy consumption, giving an added value to consumer access and interactive approach to energy and energy related solutions. An increasing number of consumers from all levels of the society, cultures, lifestyles and social status have continuous internet access through ADSL connections. Those consumers will be targeted in order to collect and analyse their acceptability in new energy technologies. The aim of this paper is to develop an internet-based methodology that brings together energy consultants, domestic consumers and renewable technologies. Consumers ’ interaction with energy consultants will be a valuable step into implementing efficiently EU policies, focusing on the introduction of <b>informative</b> <b>billing</b> through end-use energy efficiency directive and the use of renewable energy sources. Furthermore, the involvement of utility companies [6] will be valuable in order to manage efficiently electricity production and to plan demand side management and energy efficiency programs. Energy-related market will be enforced and benefited through targeted information, behavioral changes and innovative accessibility internet tools...|$|E
40|$|The European Directive on Energy End-use Efficiency and Energy Services {{requires}} EU {{member states}} to ensure that energy consumers have frequent and <b>informative</b> <b>billing,</b> along with meters that reflect consumption accurately and provide information on time of use. There is a lively debate in the UK on what new forms of metering, tariffing and billing are feasible, and on possible environmental and social consequences. The main parties to that debate have been government and the energy regulator, electricity and gas suppliers, consumer bodies, environmental organisations, and manufacturers of meters and metering accessories. This paper reports on and analyses {{some of the issues}} relating to billing, metering and attempts to change consumer behaviour in the UK. It highlights the dispute over the desirability of requiring suppliers to give feedback displays to residential customers in advance of a smart metering rollout, outlining tensions between anticipated benefits to the utilities (from smart metering) and to end-users and the environment (from improved feedback leading to conservation). Definitions, interpretations of the Directive, and the institutional context for feedback and smart metering are analysed in relation to research evidence for energy feedback as a tool for carbon reduction and demand management. The uses and limitations of the research literature in a contested area of policy are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Internet use, {{domestic}} {{energy consumption}} for electricity, demand-side management, consumers ’ education and their interaction for end-user Energy efficiency are focused in this paper. An {{increasing number of}} consumers from {{all levels of the}} society, cultures, lifestyles and social status have continuous internet access through ADSL connections. Those consumers will be targeted in order to collect and analyse their acceptability in new energy technologies and adaptive energy services. Energy Information Systems (EIS), which monitor and organize building energy consumption and related trend data over the Internet, have been evolving over the past decade and can be considered {{as a part of a}} specialized DSS. The above concept performs key energy management functions such as organizing energy use data, identifying energy consumption anomalies, managing energy costs, and automating demand response strategies and focused customer profiling. The aim of this paper is to develop an innovative internet-based methodology that brings together energy consultants, consumers and modern IT technologies under the umbrella of the Energy Governance. Consumers ’ interaction with energy consultants and IT Services will be a valuable step into implementing efficiently EU policies (2002 / 91 /EC & 2006 / 32 /EC), focusing on the introduction of <b>informative</b> <b>billing</b> and intelligent energy analysis through the end-use energy efficiency directive and the use of Energy Services (ESCOs) ...|$|E

The closing chapter {{takes a look}} at what Bill has been up to since the sell of the last Grumpys Toy at the end of 1983. The old saying goes that idle hands are the devils tool, well with no car to maintain, Bill would find other ways to keep plenty busy. Extensive work for Chevrolet would fill his time along with reverting to building engines for customers. Winners in Pro Stock, Pro Stock Truck, Comp Eliminator would follow and are all touched on in the closing chapter, Beyond the Toys.|$|R

Were it not for my guest in this issue’s Q&A, games for health would not be making the contributions they are today. Debra Lieberman is both a creator and an innovator, and her relentless quest for new and better ways to improve human well-being began before the Internet {{and put her in}} the company of similar-minded people across the educational and media landscapes. As such, Debra worked on the research and design of several noteworthy early games for learning and health behavior change.

40|$|The European Union has set ambitious energy {{efficiency}} targets, which include for ex-ample commonly known “ 20 - 20 - 20 ”-targets. In {{order to achieve}} the targets the Euro-pean Union has set directives that have led the member countries of the European Union to set a legal framework for the installation of smart meters. Among other things, the smart meters provide opportunities to develop new services that enable more efficient energy usage for the consumers. <b>Informative</b> <b>billing,</b> based on the actual consumption and the internet services that enable the consumer to monitor the hourly consumption data are two examples of these services. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate development opportunities for smart metering services in the private customer interface. Home Energy Management System, HEMS, {{is one example of}} smart metering service. During this work, a small-scale pilot study of HEMS was successfully carried through in a co-operation with a service provider. Pilot included five private households and provided customers with real-time consumption monitoring and enabled market price based steering of reserving electric heating. The customer feedback was collected with interviews and metering data was collected to calculate the potential savings. According to the customers, they did not change their energy consumption behavior significantly during the pilot. The steering of the electric heating enabled savings of 2. 4 - 3. 6 €/month when calculated with spot prices. To get a wider perspective about the customer needs for smart metering services a customer sur-vey was carried through. The survey included 187 customers who were using the current internet services provided by the DSO. There is a high interest towards real-time consumption monitoring and HEMS, but the willingness to invest is limited. The HEMS concept was evaluated based on the feedback from the customer pilot and from the survey. The results can be used when developing future smart metering services by designing the services according to the concrete needs. HEMS system that would enable to control a large number of HEMS-units collectively could enable bene-fits also for the market actors. Therefore the potential benefits were evaluated also from the supplier and the DSO perspective. The evaluated benefits were small related to the required HEMS-units that would be needed to achieve them. With the piloted cost level of HEMS, the incentive for suppliers or DSOs to offer {{energy efficiency}} service like HEMS for the private customers is reduced if there is no possibility to have additional benefits around the service or it is not required by the legislation. This would mean that HEMS is mainly a business opportunity for service providers. The pilot could be further utilized by providing the pilot customers with dynamic pricing rates. Additionally it could be used to demonstrate direct load steering, and to develop the control methods for a large number of HEMS. /Kir 1...|$|E
40|$|Energy savings {{achieved}} through {{the improvement of}} metering and billing of individual consumption of heating/cooling and domestic hot water in multi-apartment and multi-purpose buildings can {{make a contribution to}} the scaling up of efforts to achieve the energy efficiency targets of the EU in 2020 and beyond. The Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) is the cornerstone of the legal framework for accurate metering and billing of individual consumption of heating/cooling and domestic hot water in multi-apartment and multi-purpose buildings in the EU. It requires the introduction of consumption-based cost allocation and sub-annual <b>informative,</b> consumption based <b>billing</b> of heating, cooling and hot water in multi-unit buildings, subject to certain conditions. Individual meters and billing permit a fairer system of repartition of the energy costs among the occupants of multi-apartment buildings based on actual energy consumption rather than estimation done according {{to the size of the}} dwelling, etc. The purpose of this report is to provide a systematic overview of the existing thermal cost allocation rules in Member States, characterising them in term of key features, such as the permitted/recommended ranges of share of variable cost allocated according to readings from individual metering devices, use of correction factors and minimum and maximum thresholds etc. The outcome of this report might be used to guide Member States in designing/revising their thermal energy cost allocation rules.
