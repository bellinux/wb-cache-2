5|$|After Biden {{withdrew from}} the race, it was learned that he had indeed {{correctly}} credited Kinnock on other occasions. But in the Iowa speech that was recorded and distributed to reporters (with a parallel video of Kinnock) by aides to Michael Dukakis, the eventual nominee, he failed to do so. Dukakis, who disowned any knowledge of the Kinnock video, fired John Sasso, <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>manager</b> and long-time Chief of Staff, but Biden's campaign could not recover.|$|E

5|$|By 1920, Roosevelt, on Howe's advice, {{had made}} peace with Tammany boss Charles Murphy, and again sought New York state office. In July, however, he was drafted by the Democratic National Convention as the vice presidential nominee on a ticket with Ohio {{governor}} James M. Cox. Roosevelt selected Howe as <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>manager.</b> The CoxRoosevelt ticket lost overwhelmingly to Republicans Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge, but both Roosevelt and Howe saw themselves as having successfully built Roosevelt a national reputation; {{not long after the}} election, Howe boasted to several friends that Roosevelt would soon occupy the White House, taking Howe with him.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} being sworn in, Murphy hired Todd Schulte, <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>manager,</b> as his new chief of staff. He also hired one of Governor Paterson's aides, Maggie McKeon, as his {{communications}} director. For his district director, Murphy turned to Rob Scholz, a Republican. Scholz {{had worked on}} Murphy's campaign and had received praise from Larry Bulman, {{the chairman of the}} Saratoga County Democratic Committee. Within a month of being elected, Murphy opened offices in Saratoga Springs and Hudson. Murphy served the remainder of his term, but lost a reelection bid on November 2, 2010, to challenger Chris Gibson, a retired Army colonel.|$|E
5|$|After {{service in}} World War I and {{a law degree}} from Yale, Dilworth practiced law in Philadelphia. He and Clark were allies in the anti-corruption reform effort that had swept the city four years earlier. Dilworth had run for mayor unsuccessfully in 1947, with Clark as <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>manager.</b> In 1949, he was elected City Treasurer. He {{resigned}} that post to run for governor in 1950, but was defeated by Republican John S. Fine. Democratic party leaders had intended Dilworth to be their candidate for mayor again in 1951, but when Clark announced his candidacy, Dilworth agreed to run for district attorney instead. He won, taking just shy of 58% of the vote. In the primary election in May, Dilworth easily defeated his underfunded opponent, William A. Paschall, a local meat dealer.|$|E
50|$|Although Haugh {{had sworn}} off of {{politics}} years earlier {{he decided to}} run in 2014 because he couldn't stand the idea of only having a Democrat and a Republican on the ballot. Haugh became well known for <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> video where he shares his political platform. These videos are filmed from <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>manager's</b> basement.|$|R

5|$|At the DFL {{endorsement}} convention, Schiff came {{in third}} place behind Mark Andrew and Hodges {{during the first two}} rounds of voting but was denied a place on the third round ballot after failing to meet a minimum vote threshold during round two. When Schiff backed Hodges with the intention, according to the Star Tribune, of preventing Andrew from receiving the 60% of votes needed to win the endorsement, he lost the support of the Minneapolis Firefighters Union. The convention concluded with no winner and, because no one was endorsed, Schiff stated that he would remain in the race. <b>His</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>manager,</b> Mark Warren, left Schiff's campaign shortly after the convention and a few days later, he declared an end to his bid for mayor and announced that he would campaign actively for Hodges.|$|E
5|$|Free {{from any}} {{constitutional}} duties {{during the time}} between sessions, Chandler had begun laying the groundwork to succeed Laffoon as governor almost {{from the beginning of}} his term as lieutenant governor. Laffoon, however, had {{made it clear that he}} favored Thomas Rhea to be his successor. Rhea secured the services of rising political boss Earle C. Clements as <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>manager.</b> Hailing from Morganfield, only a short distance from Chandler's hometown of Corydon, Clements later said that if Chandler had asked him first, he might have managed Chandler's campaign instead of Rhea's. Instead, by virtue of managing the opposing campaign, Clements became the leader of a Democratic faction that opposed Chandler for the next three decades.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Clements faced Republican state {{attorney}} general Eldon S. Dummit. While Clements managed to keep the Democrats united following the primary, Dummit had fractured the Republicans by attacking the administration of sitting Republican governor Simeon S. Willis and his preferred successor during the Republican primary. Dummit mounted a meager challenge by citing Clements' opposition to the Taft-Hartley Act, {{but this was not}} very effective. Dummit had replaced <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>manager</b> from the primary election, and when the ousted manager turned against him in the general election, it sounded the death knell for his campaign. Clements won the election by a vote of 387,795 to 287,756. He resigned his seat in the U.S. House to accept the governorship.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Durning as Menelaus [...] "Pappy" [...] O'Daniel, the {{incumbent}} Governor of Mississippi.

5|$|Blaine {{gives in}} to Kurt's urgings and wishes and {{transfers}} to McKinley High {{so they can}} spend more time together during Kurt's senior year. Kurt and Rachel decide they want to apply to a top school for the dramatic arts in New York City, NYADA, but are intimidated when they meet some of their competition and decide their applications need to include more accomplishments: Rachel proposes that McKinley do West Side Story as the school musical so she can star in it, and Kurt runs for class president. Brittany volunteers to be <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>manager,</b> and he accepts, but when he objects to her suggestions for posters and paraphernalia as overemphasizing his sexuality, she decides {{to run for the}} office herself. Kurt tries out for the musical, but the directors aren't convinced that he's masculine enough to portray Tony, the romantic male lead, and cast Blaine instead, even though he's only a junior; Kurt is given the minor role of Officer Krupke. When Rachel believes that she might not be cast as Maria, the female lead, she panics and decides to run for class president as well, infuriating Kurt. She eventually withdraws and throws her support behind Kurt, and secretly decides to help him further by stuffing the ballot box in his favor. He nevertheless loses to Brittany, and Rachel is suspended from school for cheating. The same day that Kurt loses, his father wins a special congressional election against Sue.|$|E

25|$|With {{his wife}} as <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>manager,</b> Fuller first contested the Division of Hume at the 1940 {{election}} as the official Labor candidate, but lost to Tom Collins, the sitting Country Party member, due partly to candidates from the Lang Labor and New South Wales Labor factions standing and splitting the Labor vote.|$|E
25|$|Allen's {{first race}} for the Virginia House of Delegates was in 1979, two years after he {{graduated}} from law school. He ran in the 26th House District which was then composed of two seats. He placed third {{in a field of}} four candidates. Allen states that he lost because he wasn't himself and was listening to the advice of <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>manager</b> who suggested he wear wingtips instead of his usual cowboy boots.|$|E
25|$|McGuinty {{replaced}} many of {{his young}} staff with experienced political professionals he recruited. The three he kept in key positions were Don Guy, <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>manager</b> and a pollster with Pollara, Matt Maychak, his director of communications, and Bob Lopinski, his director of issues management.

5000|$|Turning up in California for <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> {{extremely}} drunk, Bulworth freely begins speaking {{his mind}} at public events {{and in the}} presence of the C-SPAN film crew following <b>his</b> <b>campaign.</b> After dancing all night in an underground club and smoking marijuana, he even starts rapping in public. His frank, potentially offensive remarks make him an instant media darling and re-energize <b>his</b> <b>campaign.</b> Along the way he becomes romantically involved with a young black activist named Nina, who tags along with him on <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> stops. He is pursued by the paparazzi, his insurance company, <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>managers</b> and an increasingly adoring public, all the while fearful of his impending assassination.|$|R

Johnson's economics advisor was Harvard economics professor Jeffrey Miron.|$|R
25|$|McKinley {{relied heavily}} on finance, railroads, {{industry}} and the middle classes for his support and cemented the Republicans {{as the party of}} business. <b>His</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>manager,</b> Ohio's Mark Hanna, developed a detailed plan for getting contributions from the business world and McKinley outspent his rival William Jennings Bryan by a large margin. This emphasis on business was in part mitigated by Theodore Roosevelt, the presidential successor after McKinley's assassination in 1901, who engaged in trust-busting. McKinley was the first President to promote pluralism, arguing that prosperity would be shared by all ethnic and religious groups.|$|E
25|$|Ishihara {{returned}} to the House of Representatives afterward, and {{worked his way up}} the party's internal ladder, serving as Director-General of the Environment Agency under Takeo Fukuda (1976) and Minister of Transport under Noboru Takeshita (1989). During the 1980s, Ishihara was a highly visible and popular LDP figure, but unable to win enough internal support to form a true faction and move up the national political ladder. In 1983 <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>manager</b> put up stickers throughout Tokyo stating that Ishihara's political opponent was an immigrant from North Korea. Ishihara denied that this was discrimination, saying that the public had a right to know.|$|E
