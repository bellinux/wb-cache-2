5|$|In April 1894, a Scottish {{physician}} Sir Ronald Ross visited Sir Patrick Manson at {{his house}} on Queen Anne Street, London. This visit {{was the start of}} four years of collaboration and fervent research that culminated in 1897 when Ross, who was working in the Presidency General Hospital in Calcutta, proved the complete life-cycle of the malaria parasite in mosquitoes. He thus proved that the mosquito was the vector for malaria in humans by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds. He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds. For this work, Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the Indian Medical Service, Ross worked at the newly established Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and directed malaria-control efforts in Egypt, Panama, Greece and Mauritius. The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by Walter Reed in 1900. Its recommendations were implemented by William C. Gorgas in the <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> undertaken during construction of the Panama Canal. This public-health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against the disease.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{empirical}} {{models of}} retirement which use a self-assessed <b>health</b> <b>measure</b> have often {{found that the}} wage rate has a surprisingly small effect on retirement. Using both a self-reported <b>health</b> <b>measure</b> and one not based on self-report (subsequent mortality experience) in a more general reduced-form joint-demand framework, we test {{the importance of the}} interaction effects of health and retirement. Our findings are consistent with a joint determination of health and retirement. The wage elasticity using either <b>health</b> <b>measure</b> is about equal to that found in a single-equation model when a mortality measure is used, but all three elasticities are five times greater than one found using self-reported health in a traditional single-equation model. ...|$|R

25|$|Public <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> are {{credited}} {{with much of}} the recent increase in life expectancy. During the 20th century, despite a brief drop due to the 1918 flu pandemic starting around that time the average lifespan in the United States increased by more than 30 years, of which 25 years can be attributed to advances in public health.|$|E
25|$|At {{that time}} it was not known that this fatal disease was carried by mosquitoes, so public <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> were unsuccessful. Remaining in the city to care for the sick, a number of Catholic Franciscan Sisters of Mary, Episcopalian nuns of the Sisterhood of St. Mary and clergymen sacrificed themselves. An {{epidemic}} also broke out in 1879, in which several hundred people died. So many people died or fled the epidemics that in 1879 Memphis lost its city charter and went bankrupt. Until 1893 Memphis was governed by the state as a Taxing District.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{is through}} public <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> such as not {{handling}} dead animals {{in areas where}} plague is common. Vaccines have not {{been found to be}} very useful for plague prevention. Several antibiotics are effective for treatment including streptomycin, gentamicin, and doxycycline. Without treatment it results in the death of 30% to 90% of those infected. Death, if it occurs, is typically within ten days. With treatment the risk of death is around 10%. Globally there are about 650 documented cases a year which result in ~120 deaths. The disease is most common in Africa.|$|E

Notwithstanding its world-wide recognition as a safe, efficient and cost-effective public <b>health</b> <b>measure,</b> water fluoridation has increasingly found itself in the sociopolitical arena. Factors responsible for preventing the implementation of water fluoridation include public sensitivity, anti-fluoridation campaigns, negative reporting by the media, public debates and lack of professional involvement.

25|$|Average heights {{showed little}} change {{until the second}} quarter of the 19th century, with the Industrial Revolution. The growth of canals, steamboats, and railways, as well as the public school system, mass immigration, and urbanization, {{increased}} exposure to diseases. Food prices rose in the 1830s, and industrialization brought along with it growing wealth inequality and business depressions that further worsened the situations of the poor. As a result, average stature and life expectancy declined, and only rebounded from 1910 to 1950, as incomes rose, urban conditions became less crowded, and public <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> were put in place.|$|E
25|$|Improved {{molecular}} diagnostic {{tools are}} another technological advancement {{that could help}} improve existing prevalence statistics. Recent {{research has focused on}} the development of a DNA-based tool {{that can be used for}} diagnosis of infection, specific identification of hookworm, and analysis of genetic variability in hookworm populations. Again this can serve as a major tool for different public <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> against hookworm infection. Most research regarding diagnostic tools is now focused on the creation of a rapid and cost-effective assay for the specific diagnosis of hookworm infection. Many are hopeful that its development can be achieved within the next 5 years.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has focused}} on two {{elements}} {{of the effects of}} video games on players: the player's <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> and educational achievements as a function of game play amounts; the players' behavior or perceptions {{as a function of the}} game's violence levels; the context of the game play in terms of group dynamics; the game's structure which affects players' visual attention or three dimensional constructional skills; and the mechanics of the game which affects hand-eye coordination. Two other research methods that have been used are experimental (in a laboratory), where the different environmental factors can be controlled, and non-experimental, where those who participate in studies simply log their video gaming hours.|$|E

25|$|According to Sicko, almost {{fifty million}} Americans are uninsured while the remainder, who are covered, are often victims of {{insurance}} company fraud and red tape. Furthermore, Sicko says the U.S. health {{in general is}} ranked 37 out of 191 by the World Health Organization with certain <b>health</b> <b>measures,</b> such as infant mortality and life expectancy, equal to countries with much less economic wealth. Interviews are conducted with people who thought they had adequate coverage but were denied care. Former employees of insurance companies describe cost-cutting initiatives that give bonuses to insurance company physicians and others to find reasons {{for the company to}} avoid meeting the cost of medically necessary treatments for policy holders, and thus increase company profitability.|$|E
25|$|The {{particular}} modalities {{used by a}} naturopath {{vary with}} training and scope of practice. These may include herbalism, homeopathy, acupuncture, nature cures, physical medicine, applied kinesiology, colonic enemas, chelation therapy, color therapy, cranial osteopathy, hair analysis, iridology, live blood analysis, ozone therapy, psychotherapy, public <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> and hygiene, reflexology, rolfing, massage therapy, and traditional Chinese medicine. Nature cures include a range of therapies based on exposure to natural elements such as sunshine, fresh air, or heat or cold, as well as nutrition advice such as following a vegetarian and whole food diet, fasting, or abstention from alcohol and sugar. Physical medicine includes naturopathic, osseous, or soft tissue manipulative therapy, sports medicine, exercise, and hydrotherapy. Psychological counseling includes meditation, relaxation, and other methods of stress management.|$|E
25|$|There {{have also}} been recent {{technological}} developments that will hopefully facilitate more accurate mapping of hookworm prevalence. Some researchers have begun to use geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) to examine helminth ecology and epidemiology. Brooker et al. utilized this technology to create helminth distribution maps of sub-Saharan Africa. By relating satellite derived environmental data with prevalence data from school-based surveys, {{they were able to}} create detailed prevalence maps. The study focused {{on a wide range of}} helminths, but interesting conclusions about hookworm specifically were found. As compared to other helminths, hookworm is able to survive in much hotter conditions and was highly prevalent throughout the upper end of the thermal range. Hopefully this information along with more detailed prevalence maps can lead to more effective public <b>health</b> <b>measures.</b>|$|E

25|$|Suspicion {{of modern}} {{medicine}} due to beliefs about illness being due to witchcraft also continues in many countries to this day, with tragic healthcare consequences. HIV/AIDS and Ebola virus disease are two examples of often-lethal infectious disease epidemics whose medical care and containment has been severely hampered by regional beliefs in witchcraft. Other severe medical conditions whose treatment is hampered in this way include tuberculosis, leprosy, epilepsy and the common severe bacterial Buruli ulcer. Public healthcare often requires considerable education work related to epidemology and modern health knowledge {{in many parts of}} the world where belief in witchcraft prevails, to encourage effective preventive <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> and treatments, to reduce victim blaming, shunning and stigmatization, and to prevent the killing of people and endangering of animal species for body parts believed to convey magical abilities.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the best}} known works on the history of HIV is 1987's book And the Band Played On, by Randy Shilts. Shilts contends that Ronald Reagan's {{administration}} dragged its feet in dealing with the crisis due to homophobia, while the gay community viewed early reports and public <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> with corresponding distrust, thus allowing the disease to spread {{and hundreds of thousands of}} people to needlessly die. This resulted in the formation of ACT-UP, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power by Larry Kramer. Galvanized by the federal government's inactivity, the movement by AIDS activists to gain funding for AIDS research, which on a per-patient basis out-paced funding for more prevalent diseases such as cancer and heart disease, was used as a model for future lobbying for health research funding.|$|E
25|$|Common market <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> such as GDP and GNP {{have been}} used as a measure of {{successful}} policy. On average richer nations tend to be happier than poorer nations, but this effect seems to diminish with wealth. This has been {{explained by the fact that}} the dependency is not linear but logarithmic, i.e., the same percentual increase in the GNP produces the same increase in happiness for wealthy countries as for poor countries. Increasingly, academic economists and international economic organisations are arguing for and developing multi-dimensional dashboards which combine subjective and objective indicators to provide a more direct and explicit assessment of human wellbeing. Work by Paul Anand and colleagues helps to highlight the fact that there many different contributors to adult wellbeing, that happiness judgement reflect, in part, the presence of salient constraints, and that fairness, autonomy, community and engagement are key aspects of happiness and wellbeing throughout the life course.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{describes}} a large cohort of untreated Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patients at initial assessment and examines changes within the illness over three years. Furthermore, a ‘current state of health’ scale, developed in previous studies, was validated {{for use as}} a method for accurately measuring recovery. Possible predictors of outcome were then identified by investigating the role of baselines measures in subsequent recovery. Two-hundred-and-twenty-six patients completed questionnaires at initial assessment. The current state of health score was used to measure recovery six, 18 and 36 months later. Associations between baseline measures of fatigue, psychopathology, mood, cognition, stress and current state of health were examined to look at the validity of the state of <b>health</b> <b>measure.</b> Demographic and psychosocial characteristics were investigated as predictors of recovery. Illness characteristics such as illness length, illness onset type and illness beliefs were also investigated as predictors of outcome. There was strong evidence to suggest that the current state of <b>health</b> <b>measure</b> accurately describes the patient’s health at baseline. Data suggests that illness length, symptom severity and health status have an important role in recovery. The current state of <b>health</b> <b>measure</b> was validated as a method of accurately assessing the health status of patients and was used as an indicator of improvement and recovery within this group. Spontaneous recovery in the patient group was associated with several factors measured at initial assessment...|$|R
25|$|It {{was also}} a city of extreme social {{inequality}} between the so-called 'millocracy' and the workers; Elizabeth Gaskell once described an acquaintance attending a ball wearing £400 of lace and £10,000 in diamonds. The Gaskell family moved between the two worlds, allowing Gaskell not only to collect charitable subscriptions from their wide circle and promote longer-lasting changes from within the local bureaucracy, but also to understand the real concerns of those living in poverty, with whom he was probably more at ease. In 1833 he helped to found the non-denominational Manchester Domestic Home Mission, and he acted as its secretary for many years. Inspired by a visit from Boston minister Joseph Tuckerman, the mission gave practical assistance such as food and blankets to the poor. He {{was also a}}ctive in the District Provident Society, an organisation founded by James Kay and William Langton with similar pragmatic aims. Gaskell supported public <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> and housing reform, sitting on the committee of the Manchester and Salford Sanitary Association, as well as another committee formed to regulate beer halls in the area.|$|E
25|$|Decrees {{were made}} in January 1982 {{concerning}} official recognition of persons and bodies responsible for noise monitoring, the monitoring of carbon monoxide and benzene levels in the atmosphere at workplaces, and the inspection of electrical installations. A decree issued in February 1982 laid down safety measures to be taken against electrical hazards arising during the construction, operation and maintenance of electric power distribution installations. A decree issued by the Minister of Labour in March 1982 specified the offices responsible for carrying out the technical tests on particularly dangerous machinery (listed in a decree of April 1981) which are required before the machinery can be officially approved. It also specified the {{information to be provided}} by the person applying for official approval. A decree of May 1982 contained provisions on the setting up, restructuring, organization, financing and tasks of occupational health services in agricultural undertakings and listed those agricultural undertakings for which special medical surveillance is required. Another decree, made that same month, contained new regulations governing health, safety and preventive <b>health</b> <b>measures</b> in public undertakings. It laid down detailed health and safety requirements and specified how these were to be met. It also contained provisions on training in the area, medical surveillance, and health and safety services. Two Orders of July 1982 amended the rules applicable to fixed-term contracts and temporary work with the intention of restricting the use of casual labour and improving the living and working conditions of workers in insecure jobs. A law of July 1982 concerning the spouses of craftsmen and tradesmen employed in the family business amended the provisions of the labour code, social security system, civil code and company law to establish an occupational status for this group of people. In June 1982, a new popular savings book paying index-linked interest was introduced, under which Individuals domiciled for tax purposes in France and whose tax liability was under FF 1 000 were entitled to hold a maximum of FF 10000 (FF 20000 for households) savings in that scheme. Also in 1982, holidays for the low-paid were encouraged by an extension of holiday Vouchers (Cheques-Vacances), subsidized by the employer and requiring regular saving out of earnings. A banking law of January 1984 entitled individuals lacking current accounts who had been refused by three banks to ask the Bank of France to designate a bank or the postal bank to provide them with free accounts.|$|E
