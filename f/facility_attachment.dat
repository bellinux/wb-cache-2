40|$|The study {{examined}} {{the degree to which}} teens at high risk for behaviour problems rely on friends and romantic partners rather than parents to meet attachment needs and whether this affected their psychological adjustment. Participants were 158 adolescents recruited from youth custody settings and a mental health <b>facility.</b> <b>Attachment</b> functions shifted from parents to peers much earlier compared to previously published results based on normative samples. Only 9 % of participants preferred their parents for proximity seeking, 18 % for safe haven, 23 % for secure base, and 17 % reported separation distress. Males reported experiencing greater separation distress in relation to their parents than females. No other gender differences were found. For all attachment functions, adolescents who turned more to their romantic partners than to their friends or parents reported higher levels of internalizing symptoms. No significant differences were found for externalizing symptoms. Clinical implications were discussed including the necessity of attachment-based interventions...|$|E

As bacterial attachment to human tissues {{is known to be}} correlated with antibiotic resistance, we have investigated here the relationship between bacterial attachment to environmental particles and antibiotic resistance in agricultural isolates. We evaluated 203 Escherichia coli isolates collected from swine <b>facilities</b> for <b>attachment</b> to quartz, resistance to 13 antibiotics, and the presence of genes encoding 13 attachment factors. The genes encoding type I, EcpA, P pili, and Ag 43 were detected, though none was significantly related to attachment. Quartz attachment was positively and significantly (P < 0. 0038) related to combined resistance to amoxicillin/streptomycin/tetracycline/sulfamethazine/tylosin/chlortetracycline and negatively and significantly (P < 0. 0038) related to combined resistance to nalidixic acid/kanamycin/neomycin. These results provide clear evidence for a link between antibiotic resistance and attachment to quartz in agricultural isolates. We propose that {{this may be due to}} encoding by the responsible genes on a mobile genetic element. Further exploration of the relationship between antibiotic resistance and attachment to environmental particles will improve the understanding and modeling of environmental transport processes, with the goal of preventing human exposure to antibiotic-resistant or virulent microorganisms...|$|R

30|$|According to the {{information}} provided by NRC, the rail system between Iddo and Ijoko/Kajawla comprises 25 train stations. These stations are all stopping points for the transit service and are principally used for the loading and unloading of goods and passengers. Some of these stations have multiple-track <b>facilities</b> for coach <b>attachment</b> and detachment. The MTT is generally considered as the economy train because of its cheaper fare charges, the number of coaches hauled and the seating capacity. The DMU, on the other hand, is considered as a first-class train because of the air-conditioned coaches, small number of coaches hauled and reduced seating capacity which make it more expensive. The rail service operates from Monday through Saturday and runs three shifts: morning (06 : 00 – 14 : 00), afternoon (14 : 00 – 22 : 00) and night (22 : 00 – 06 : 00) shifts. As {{at the time of}} this survey, the fare charged per trip either way regardless of the boarding station was 230 naira 1 for Mass Transit Train (MTT) and 300 naira for Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU) train during off peak period. However, the fare charged by the DMU during the peak period (06 : 00 – 12 : 59 and 16 : 01 – 21 : 00) could go up to as high as 750 naira.|$|R
40|$|Despite recent {{drops in}} rates, {{juvenile}} incarceration remains {{a serious issue}} in the United States (Hockenberry, 2013; Mendel, 2011). One shared part of the incarceration experience across different systems and facility types is the obligation for juvenile offenders to receive correctional education. Ample research demonstrates that increased academic achievement, attending community school, and being employed are connected to better community outcomes and desistance, yet {{little is known about}} how school experiences in the facility influences these outcomes. Applying life-course theory of the development of crime (Sampson 2 ̆ 6 Laub, 1997, 2005), the present study investigates whether correctional education serves as a turning point to influence a number of community adjustment outcomes in serious juvenile offenders. Specifically, it tested how subjective (teacher bonding and school orientation) and objective (grades, time spent in the facility school) parts of the school experience during the facility stay were related to transitioning to community schools (attendance), and/or work (gainful activity and employment), self-reported delinquency, and staying in the community at 6 and 12 months after release for a sample of 519 male and 50 female serious juvenile offenders. Results showed that across juvenile and adult <b>facilities,</b> improved <b>attachment</b> to the <b>facility</b> school while incarcerated predicted increased involvement in gainful activity and decreases in self-reported delinquency up to 12 months after release. This positive effect was greatest for younger offenders who returned to school, even when accounting for the number of previous facility stays and prior community school experiences. Conversely, older offenders who returned to gainful employment showed less positive adjustment. In contrast to other studies, grades received while incarcerated were not a significant predictor of community adjustment. Overall, the results repeatedly show behavioral differences based on individual history and experiences during incarceration across different types of facilities, strongly supporting a research agenda that treats incarceration as more than a binary variable. The present results add to the corpus of evidence that the perspective of the incarcerated juveniles matter and suggest that the school experience while incarcerated can serve as an important turning point, indicating resources should be directed towards enhancing juveniles’ school orientation and relationships with teachers...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} topological {{excitations}} {{and the related}} ground state degeneracy are employed to establish an effective theory of the superconducting state evolving from the Mott insulator for high-Tc cuprates. Casting the Coulomb interaction in terms of composite-fermions via the gauge flux <b>attachment</b> <b>facility,</b> we show that instanton events in the Matsubara "imaginary time," labeled by topological winding numbers, are essential configurations of the phase field dual to the charge. In analogy to the usual phase transition that {{is characterized by a}} sudden change of the symmetry, the topological phase transitions are governed by a discontinuous change of the topological numbers signaled by the divergence of the zero-temperature topological susceptibility. This defines a quantum criticality ruled by topologically conserved numbers rather than the Landau principle of the symmetry breaking. We show that in the limit of strong correlations topological charge is linked to the average electronic filling number and the topological susceptibility to the electronic compressibility of the system. We exploit the impact of these nontrivial U(1) instanton phase field configurations for the cuprate phase diagram which displays the "hidden" quantum critical point covered by the superconducting lobe in addition to a sharp crossover between a compressible normal "strange metal" state and a region characterized by a vanishing compressibility, which marks the Mott insulator. Finally, we argue that the existence of robust quantum numbers explains the stability against small perturbation of the system and attributes to the topological "quantum protectorate" as observed in strongly correlated systems.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology in Environmental Management In the Faculty of Applied Sciences Department of Environmental and Occupational Studies At the Cape Peninsula University of TechnologyRivers, lakes and streams are the only way people encounter water sources in urban areas. Human endeavours have consequently deteriorated the environmental quality provided by river systems thus rivers are supporting a fraction of their original biodiversity and abundance. Urban streams are highly valuable and sensitive systems which, can be assessed by means of impacts of urban catchment and pathway influences. Many of {{the problems associated with}} environmental quality and management of urban watercourses are as a result of poor public perception. Advances in river assessment and management has come about through the recognition that water resource problems involve biological, physical and chemical components and more recently the addition of social and economic aspects. Social public participation is therefore achieved by studying and acting on people’s values, behaviours and perceptions of environmental quality. The main aim of this research was to identify whether a difference in socio-economic status is an influential factor in people’s perception of environmental quality. The objectives of the research were to determine whether the Elsieskraal River has a perceived low environmental relevance and quality (health and aesthetics), to determine what sensitizes people about issues relating to the natural environment and to identify people’s uses and perceptions of the Elsieskraal River corridor and its importance to the enjoyment as a recreational space. The study used a qualitative approach to obtain the data using the focus group technique. The purposive sample of participants from Pinelands and Thornton were the population that this study sought to investigate. Two focus group discussions; one in each study area was conducted. The results of this study found both similarities and differences in people’s perceptions of the Elsieskraal River between the two different socioeconomic urban communities. The perceived observation that the Elsieskraal River was a canal and not a river set the foundation for the envisaged low environmental quality the river so acquired. The majority overall environmental quality scores for the attributes of aquatic life, vegetation and water quality were found to be lower than they were scientifically found to be. Two clear avenues concerning environmental information sourcing and sensitization to the public was found. Politicians and government officials were unreliable to relay environmental information of a trustworthy nature. Community newspapers were a useful tool to present theevidence of information concerning the status of the natural environment especially at a local level. Three themes namely safety, maintenance and <b>facilities</b> and community <b>attachment</b> emerged on the importance of the Elsieskraal River as a recreational space. It is recommended that further studies should examine the perceptions of other similar rivers in the urban environment, both natural and canalised within Cape Town and the greater South Africa. The findings can assist environmental managers, planners and educators identify the gaps between the scientific environmental conditions and what people’s perceived awareness and knowledge about environmental quality are (factual versus perceived). It is also recommended that emphasis and support from local authorities must be given to non-governmental organisations (NGO’s) and adjacent property owners to aid in mobilising people into “ownership of rivers” within their communities to enhance their value and utilisation...|$|R
