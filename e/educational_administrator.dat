500|$|Baxter's biggest {{clashes with}} {{academic}} staff were over governance issues. He had {{a preference for}} industry-style organisation, with clear lines of authority. In 1957, he created a committee of deans, chaired by himself, that met every Wednesday. This became the vice-chancellor's advisory committee in 1960. Through this he created an administrative mechanism which set the university free from the traditional constraints. He did away {{with the election of}} deans by the faculty, replacing it with one in which deans were appointed by the University Council on his recommendation. This provided for more efficient administration, but violated the academic tradition of a dean being primus inter pares among academic colleagues. This aroused the ire of academic staff, and in the end a compromise was reached whereby each faculty elected a chairman who was responsible for academic matters, while the council appointed a dean {{who was in charge of}} administrative matters. This proved to be quite successful, and was retained by Baxter's successors. Ronald Hartwell characterised Baxter's administration as [...] "unusual, undemocratic and unacademic". His successor, Rupert Myers, declared that: [...] "History will show Sir Philip Baxter to have been a great <b>educational</b> <b>administrator</b> who built a fine university and made many beneficial changes in the ways universities handled their business and interacted with governments and the community." ...|$|E

The study was guided by a grand tour question addressed by three sub-questions. Data collected during the individual interviews with 10 retired <b>educational</b> <b>administrators</b> provided the basic understanding of the issues and lived experiences as they transition into retirement from fulltime employment as <b>educational</b> <b>administrators</b> to retirees from the State of Alabama educational system. An analysis of interview data revealed four themes regarding the perceptions and lived experiences of recently retired K- 12 <b>educational</b> <b>administrators</b> from the State of Alabama. These four major themes were (a) finances, (b) pressures, (c), self-importance, and (d) health issues. The experiences of recently retired participants showed economic issues {{have a profound effect}} upon retirees, especially when they are unfavorable, and the absence of workplace activity may well lead to decreased self-worth and insecurity.

40|$|Education in Pakistan is provincial subject {{according}} to the constitution. The Education administration system of all the provinces is decentralized after the devolution plan of education; hence there are some differences present in the functions of educational administration systems in all the provinces of Pakistan. The major purpose {{of this research was}} to conduct a comparative study of the provincial educational administration system in Pakistan. The main objectives of the study were: a) to examine the existing setup of educational administration in all the provinces of Pakistan, b) to determine the similarities among all the provincial educational administration systems in Pakistan, c) to determine the dissimilarities among all the provincial educational administration systems in Pakistan, d) to compare the effectiveness of all the provincial educational administration systems in Pakistan, e) to point out the weaknesses of all the provincial educational administration systems in Pakistan, f) to suggest some measures for improvement in all the provincial educational administration systems in Pakistan. All the <b>educational</b> <b>administrators</b> working as the head of departments and their subordinates in district level of educational administration in all the provinces of Pakistan and all the <b>educational</b> <b>administrators</b> working on the key post at provincial level of educational administration in Punjab, Sindh, NWFP and Baluchistan. The random sampling technique was used to select the sample of the study. A sample of 185 <b>educational</b> <b>administrators,</b> among them 145 were District level <b>Educational</b> <b>Administrators</b> and 40 were provincial level <b>Educational</b> <b>Administrators,</b> was selected from four provinces (Punjab, Sindh, NWFP and Baluchistan). 145 District level <b>educational</b> <b>administrators,</b> among them 40 were District Education Officers, (DEO) and 105 were Deputy District Education Officers (DDEO) from various districts of Punjab, Sindh, NWFP and Baluchistan. The procedure for selecting the sample was as follow: Out of 34 districts, randomly 7 districts selected from Punjab namely Attock, Rawalpindi, Chakwal, Jehlum, Rahim Yar Khan, Sahiwal, and Mianwali. Out of 21 districts, randomly 5 districts selected from Sindh namely Hyderabad, Jamshoro, Dadu, Badin, and Thatta. Out of 24 districts, randomly 5 districts selected from NWFP namely Peshawar, Abbottabad, BAnnu, Nowshera and Swabi. Out of 26 distircts, randomly 3 districts selected from Baluchistan namely Quetta, Mastong, and Pishin. Then from each selected district 2 to 3 District Education Officers (DEOs) and 3 to 8 Deputy District Education Officers (DDEOs) were randomly selected. 40 provincial level <b>educational</b> <b>administrators</b> among them 10 each from every province were selected randomly. Two questionnaires (one for district <b>educational</b> <b>administrators</b> and other for provincial <b>educational</b> <b>administrators)</b> were developed, validated and administrated to sample of the study to collect data.

The first of these factors, affective anxiety regarding computers independently explains 37. 99 % of the variance; the second factor, cognitive anxiety regarding computers forms 12. 49 % of the variance. These two factors, which consist of 20 items altogether, explain 50. 48 % of the variance. It {{was found that the}} scale was able to discriminate the computer anxiety level of <b>educational</b> <b>administrators</b> with respect to computer efficacy. With the scale, the correlation between Spielberger State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (Öner and Le Compte, 1983) was calculated as 0. 34 and 0. 25. In addition, the correlation coefficient between the scale and Happner and Petersen’s Problem-Solving Inventory (Şahin, Şahin, Happner, 1993) was found to be 0. 40. The internal consistency coefficient was calculated as (a) 0. 87. Item total score reliability coefficients were calculated between 0. 23 and 0. 71.
