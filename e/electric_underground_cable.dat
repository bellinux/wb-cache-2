In 1888 he retired with the rank of colonel, lived on his military pension in the town of Aleshki (now Oleshky, Kherson Oblast, Ukraine) and died in 1898. Since no money was found on him when he died, the burial was paid for by a credit secured by the colonel's furniture.|$|R

Some examples include nuclear reactor design, materials processing, aircraft cabin insulation and pressuzized-gas <b>underground</b> <b>electric</b> transmission <b>cables.</b> In all, ten inner cylinder temperature distributions were examined, offering insight into the nature of complex annular convective flow patterns and the thermal conditions that cause them.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{engineering}} field {{there are many}} applications where {{it is important to}} evaluate the heat exchange between cylindrical surfaces and the surrounding ground (horizontal geothermal exchangers for heat pumps, <b>underground</b> pipelines, <b>underground</b> <b>electric</b> <b>cables,</b> etc [...] .). For these reasons, there is an increased interest in the correct analysis of the soil thermal resistance. In this study different types of soils with linear heat sources were considered and, through a physical model reproduced in laboratory, the thermal field was evaluated. The model reproduced an “undisturbed” portion of soil and the influence of different thermal conditions of the linear heat sources and of the environmental parameters were evaluated. This paper will be extended through the implementation of the experimental device into a numerical model by applying a calculation software to the finite volumes; the result is a predictive model of the soil resistance able to furnish accurate information of the real mean radial thermal resistivity surrounding the geothermal exchanger...|$|R

40|$|By {{the rapid}} of urban growth, it is {{impossible}} to accommodate the number and size of feeder required for distribution using the overhead line system approach. As an alternative the <b>underground</b> <b>cables</b> becomes more increasingly necessary to replace some of the overhead line for power transmission and distribution. Because of that reason, <b>underground</b> XLPE <b>cables</b> are the most popular for the underground systems. Performance of <b>underground</b> <b>cables</b> in service is being critical because of ageing mechanisms influences. There are many suitable techniques can be used to evaluate performance of aged and unaged <b>underground</b> <b>cables.</b> One of the techniques is based on tan delta and capacitance parameters of <b>underground</b> <b>cables.</b> This study only focuses on <b>underground</b> XLPE <b>cables,</b> which are voltage rated atl lkV and 22 kV for 1 -core and 3 -cores types. By using Tettex Instruments — Schering Bridge Model 2816, tan delta and capacitance data of XLPE <b>underground</b> <b>cables</b> are obtained. Tan delta and capacitance measurements were performed at ambient temperature (26. 6 °C) and at power frequency (50 Hz). From these analyses, show that tan delta values will be increased proportional with aging time of cables in service. Aging mechanisms are contributes these deteriorations of cables in service and consequently values of tan delta are increased with aging time of cable. Meanwhile, form capacitance analysis, the values of capacitance will be increased when contaminants, protrusions and voids are affected cables insulation and when moisture enters inside <b>underground</b> <b>cable</b> systems...|$|R

With the imminent re-regulation of the power industry and investor owned utilities becoming more cost conscious, the need for an on-line, non-destructive, incipient cable fault detection system is prevalent. With such an incipient fault detection system, utilities could schedule service on the failing cable and minimize the outages their customers would experience due to power failure. The long-term objective of this research is to develop an on-line, non-destructive, fault detection technique that could detect incipient <b>cable</b> failures in <b>underground</b> power distribution systems. As part of this research, this thesis presents: 1. The development of experimental setups to generate an extensive data library from:a. on-line monitoring of <b>cable</b> in TU <b>Electric's</b> <b>underground</b> power distribution systems; b. controlled experiments on field aged cable samples and on new intentionally damaged distribution cable sections at the TAMU Downed Conductor Test Facility. 2. Analysis of data recorded at TAMU and TU Electric. 3. The characterization of recorded data from on-line monitoring of <b>underground</b> distribution <b>cable</b> systems and staged cable experiments. 4. A comparison of the data from the TAMU cable experiments and data collected from TU <b>Electric</b> <b>underground</b> power systems. Analysis of field aged cable samples tested on various days at TAMU showed similarities in abnormal activities. Comparable characteristics were observed in the TAMU and TU Electric data, but with differing levels of magnitude and duration.

The fact that positive willingness-to-pay does not correlate positively with increasing lengths of <b>underground</b> <b>cables</b> in 60 % of cases underlines that cables are not supported unconditionally. All-in-all, the thesis that cables increase acceptance of grid development has to be rejected based on the WTP-evaluation presented in this paper...|$|R
