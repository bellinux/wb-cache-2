One such case arose and was investigated in a diocesan tribunal before the findings were submitted to the competent officials in Rome for further investigation. The C.C.S. validated this process on 30 June 1984 while a panel of medical experts approved the miraculous nature of this healing on 27 June 1991. Theologians approved it as well on 20 December 1991 after confirming the miracle came as a result of Martillo's intercession while the C.C.S. approved the findings of both bodies on 18 February 1992. John Paul II approved this miracle on 7 March 1992 and beatified her in Saint Peter's Square on 25 October 1992.|$|E
25|$|The {{company was}} formed from volunteers from all {{branches}} of the Army, and like all of the Independent Companies, it was organised under the philosophy that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> self-sufficient force. As such, {{it was to be}} a complete and powerful organisation with its own organic signals, engineering, transport, quartermaster and medical support. The company had a strength of 20 officers and 275 men (larger than a typical infantry company) and was divided into a headquarters and three platoons, with each platoon consisting of 75 men, commanded by a captain, with three sections below that, each commanded by a lieutenant. As firepower was deemed to be an essential element of the company's ability to conduct successful operations within the context as a raiding force, there was an abundance of automatic and section support weapons, including 0.303 Lee–Enfield sniper rifles (SMLEs), Bren light machine guns (LMGs), 2-inch mortars and Thompson and Owen submachine guns, to the extent that in battle each platoon could provide a level of firepower equivalent to that of an infantry company.|$|E
25|$|Aperiodic tilings were {{considered}} as mathematical artefacts until 1984, when physicist Dan Shechtman announced {{the discovery of}} a phase of an aluminium-manganese alloy which produced a sharp diffractogram with an unambiguous fivefold symmetry – so <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> crystalline substance with icosahedral symmetry. In 1975 Robert Ammann had already extended the Penrose construction to a three-dimensional icosahedral equivalent. In such cases the term 'tiling' is taken to mean 'filling the space'. Photonic devices are currently built as aperiodical sequences of different layers, being thus aperiodic in one direction and periodic in the other two. Quasicrystal structures of Cd-Te appear to consist of atomic layers in which the atoms are arranged in a planar aperiodic pattern. Sometimes an energetical minimum or a maximum of entropy occur for such aperiodic structures. Steinhardt has shown that Gummelt's overlapping decagons allow the application of an extremal principle and thus provide the link between the mathematics of aperiodic tiling and the structure of quasicrystals. Faraday waves have been observed to form large patches of aperiodic patterns. The physics of this discovery has revived the interest in incommensurate structures and frequencies suggesting to link aperiodic tilings with interference phenomena.|$|E

500|$|A {{piezoelectric}} {{material is}} one which changes shape when an electric field is applied. In reverse, it produces an electric field {{when it is}} distorted. A piezoelectric transducer, in essence, is made simply by plating electrodes on to the piezoelectric material. Early piezoelectric materials used in transducers such as barium titanate had poor temperature stability. [...] This precluded the transducer from functioning {{as one of the}} resonators; <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> separate component. [...] This problem was solved with the introduction of lead zirconate titanate (abbreviated PZT) which is stable enough {{to be used as a}} resonator. Another common piezoelectric material is quartz, which has also been used in mechanical filters. [...] However, ceramic materials such as PZT are preferred for their greater electromechanical coupling coefficient.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the seventh season, the {{producers}} sought to re-introduce Dax but with a new host. They decided immediately that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> female character, as otherwise Kira Nerys, played by Nana Visitor, would be the only female main character. There were some difficulties in finding an actress who met the requirements of the part; Ira Steven Behr said [...] "So we started the casting process, and all I saw was a lot of people who couldn't play the part. There was absolutely no one in the running." [...] The initial casting call required an actress with a [...] "spooky" [...] quality, but following the failure to find someone adequate, co-supervising producer René Echevarria suggested that the character instead should be someone who was unprepared to be joined with Dax and only did so because of an unexpected occurrence.|$|E
500|$|Because of its {{previous}} {{contributions to the}} series—Halo 2s Blastacular and Halo: Reachs Defiant map pack—Certain Affinity was approached by 343 Industries to streamline the multiplayer maps to take Halo: Reachs gameplay options into account. The multiplayer is powered by the Halo: Reach engine. 343 Industries director Frank O'Connor said {{that the decision to}} use Reach for the multiplayer was controversial, even within the studio. [...] "In Halos day, there was never a proper networking mode," [...] O'Connor explained. [...] "We couldn't roll back the technology; [...] just wouldn't have worked with things like latency and all other modern Xbox Live-related problems. So we would have had to build it from scratch, and it still wouldn't have been the experience [...] remember." [...] An additional consideration O'Connor mentioned was that producing a full replication of Combat Evolveds multiplayer would have divided the Halo player base and interrupted Reachs lifespan. In choosing which seven Halo maps to remake, 343 Industries set a number of rules—the map could not have been previously remade for a 360-era Halo title, it had to work with Reachs gameplay sandbox, and <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fan favorite. The company retained the same art director between the campaign and multiplayer elements of Anniversary to make sure the two halves of the game looked visually cohesive.|$|E

But <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Sunday to allow Ulla Winblad {{to step out of}} her swaying chaise, on an outing from the city.

He agreed with the majority that the Common Schools Act did not infringe s. 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867 and was constitutional. [...] He began by noting that the purpose of s. 93 was to resolve a question that had caused serious difficulties in the former Province of Canada, prior to Confederation. [...] Paragraphs 93(2) and (3) only applied to the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. [...] The constitutionality of the Common Schools Act depended entirely on paragraph 93(1). [...] It was not simply a right of privilege of the minority faith which triggers paragraph 93(1). [...] <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> right or privilege, {{of the members of the}} minority faith, with respect to denominational schools, which they had at law at the time of Union, and which was prejudicially affected by a subsequent government action.|$|E

[...] The 1962 Chevy II rode a 110-inch wheelbase, compared to 109.5 for the Ford Falcon, at which Chevy's new compact was aimed. [...] "I think that was the quickest program we ever did at any time," [...] he continued. [...] "We worked night and day on that car, and it didn't take very long to run it through our shop because we had a deadline." [...] And that's what made the Chevy II one of the fastest new-car development programs in GM history – just 18 months after the designers got the green light, the first production Chevy II rolled off the Willow Run, Michigan, assembly line in August 1961, in time for its September 29 introduction. Unlike the Corvair, the 1962 Chevy II was deliberately never intended to be revolutionary in concept or execution; its mission was to give Chevrolet buyers a simple, back-to-the-basics compact car. When he announced the Chevy II to the press, Chevrolet General Manager Ed Cole described the car as offering [...] "maximum functionalism with thrift." ...|$|E

[...] Appearances are made by Bieber's friend, Christian Beadles, as well as rapper Lil Romeo and singer/actress Jasmine Villegas, whose appearance further fuelled media speculation Villegas and Bieber were romantically involved after a previous appearance in his music video for 'Baby'. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News reviewed the video, [...] "Here's the play-by-play: While Kingston and the lady in question are flirting out on the deck, Bieber is chilling inside. But, wait — there she is flirting with Bieber while Kingston is hanging out, wondering where she went. The fickle girl eventually leaves Bieber to chill with Kingston, and then — boom — there she is with Bieber again. And, well, you get it. Of course, the 'eenie-meenie-miny-moe lover' eventually gets caught. While she's chatting up Kingston, along comes Bieber, and her game is blown. The dudes are cool with it.
