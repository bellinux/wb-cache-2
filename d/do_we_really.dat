[...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com found Hairspray [...] "reasonably entertaining. But <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> need to be entertained reasonably? Waters' original was a crazy sprawl that made perfect sense; this Hairspray toils needlessly {{to make sense of}} that craziness, and something gets lost in the translation." [...] Zacharek was also displeased with the way Latifah's performance of [...] "I Know Where I've Been" [...] was incorporated into the movie, saying [...] "The filmmakers may believe they're adding an extra layer of seriousness to the material... the inclusion of this big production number only suggests that the filmmakers fear the audience won't get the movie's message unless it's spelled out for them." ...|$|E

[...] He commended the musical diversity of the tracks, highlighting [...] "Let It Snow", [...] "Winter Wonderland", and [...] "Every Day's Like Christmas", and highlighted [...] "White December", [...] "Cried Out Christmas", and [...] "Christmas Wrapping" [...] as the best tracks. Lauren Murphy from The Irish Times argued the relevance of the album, by stating [...] "We’ve heard it all before, so <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> need another pop star doing another bog-standard Christmas album with a sprinkling of festive cheese? To be fair, Kylie Minogue is better placed than most to do such an album, given her longevity in the business." [...] Murphy concluded [...] "2,000 Miles {{is one of the few}} saving graces on yet another inessential album that will have no bearing on your enjoyment of the festive season whatsoever."

[...] The Independents Andy Gill commented that the album finds No Doubt [...] "making only the most tentative divergences from previously tried and tested strategies, which gives Push and Shove a character that {{could be described as}} either dated or timeless", while noting that [...] "the title-track offers a fun, ebullient return to their ska-punk roots". Rolling Stone critic Jody Rosen expressed that [...] "he songs are catchy, but Gwen Stefani doesn't have the voice, or the gravitas, for grandiose tunes. And <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> want a 'mature' No Doubt record, anyway?" [...] Maria Schurr of PopMatters panned the lyrics as [...] "abysmally bad" [...] and remarked, [...] "After 'One More Summer'—which has a gigantic chorus perfectly suited for Wet Seal's speakers—and the inconsistent but decent title song, the album becomes so filler-centric that even the tracks' titles [...] are interchangeable."

5000|$|Jason Shawahn from About.com {{gave it a}} {{positive}} review, awarding it four stars out of five. He praised the album for its inclusion of two new songs, which he feels were [...] "among the finest tracks that Kylie has recorded in years" [...] and show her at her best. He later finished saying [...] "but as far as providing the comprehensive Kylie, the folks at EMI have done a pretty good job." [...] In a review for Stylus Magazine, Mark Edwards called the first disc [...] "horribly naff" [...] and full of [...] "squeaky songs". The review also mentioned [...] "every year or two she’ll release another pop gem, sell a squillion more calendars and finally retire as a multi-millionairess with a greatest hits compilation in every household. Because everyone loves Kylie, even if half of this album is terrible." [...] Jaime Gill from Yahoo! Music gave it {{a positive}} review, saying [...] "But why not accept it as merely the brand for a shiny double CD of brilliant pop tunes?

Then all the orchestration—you know, I wrote these string lines that are actually, have kind of a fantastical, more complex nature to it. That just supports a melody that is more of a whistler." [...] Marvel agreed with this approach, and worked with Tyler to hone the orchestration; [...] "as the graphics were being <b>done</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> wanted to hit little moments with some sparkly shimmer and get it more specific."

Was that Christmas dinner never really eaten, after which we arose, and generously and eloquently rendered honour to our late rival, present in the company, then and there exchanging friendship and forgiveness, and founding an attachment, not to be surpassed in Greek or Roman story, which subsisted until death?

Indeed, I agreed with our young Cato heartily in what he said about Statues. We must have an Act for the Suppression, either of Great Men, or else of Sculptors. I have not quite made up my mind which are the greater nuisances; but I am sure of this, that there are too many of both. They used to be rare (to use a Yankeeism omitted by Bartlett), but nowadays they are overdone. I am half inclined to think that the sculptors club together to write folks up during their lives in the newspapers, quieting their consciences with the hope of some day making them look so mean in bronze or marble as to make all square again.

It encompasses complex and sensitive equipment that requires different maintenance and quality control. Despite the development of dedicated training programs and extensive research justifying the endoscopic revolution, the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate (DHI) [1] recently surprised endoscopic surgeons with its report entitled Risks of Minimally Invasive Surgery Underestimated [2]. In this report, the Inspectorate expressed its sincere concern regarding endoscopic surgery in The Netherlands. The DHI report was based on investigations done by the Inspectorate initiated by unusual observations of incidents associated with endoscopic surgery. The investigations consisted of questionnaires and on-site visits to hospitals and endoscopic surgeons. Such activity is part of DHI’s task to control the quality of health care in general.
