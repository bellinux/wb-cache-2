40|$|Dust {{particles}} in the atmosphere are a key cause of nuisance, health and other environmental problems. The mining sector is {{a major source of}} airborne particulate matter caused by operations like terrain clearing, drilling, blasting, tipping and loading and the passage of vehicles on unpaved roads. The nuisance effect of airborne dust can be measured by using dust buckets and/or directional dust deposition gauges. Dust buckets are used to determine vertical dust deposition rates and directional dust deposition gauges are used to determine the direction of the sources. Traditionally the measurement of the vertical flux of dust, or dust deposition has been used as to indicate the nuisance caused by coarse suspended particulate matter. Several countries have produced standards for permissible dust deposition rates. Although alternative deposition measurement methods have been proposed, ASTM D 1739 has remained the method most often used in the South African mining and industrial sectors to measure dust deposition. In addition, a number of non-standard directional dust deposition gauges have been used. SANS 1929 : 2005 (South African National Standards, 2005) prescribes the use of ASTM D 1739 : 98 for measuring dust deposition. However, for historical reasons the previous version, ASTM D 1739 : 70 (re-approved as ASTM D 1739 : 82) is still widely used and in the recently promulgated South African Dust Management regulations the use of this version is prescribed. In order to determine the difference in the results obtained by the two versions, ASTM D 1739 : 82 and ASTM D 1739 : 98 were used to measure dust deposition levels arising from a coal mining operation in the Mpumalanga Province and a gold mining operation in North-West Province. In order to determine whether a correlation exists between vertical dust flux (dust deposition) and horizontal dust flux, standard directional horizontal dust flux gauges according to BS 1747 part 5 were also set up at both sites. The measurement of dust deposition using three dust deposition gauges (i. e. ASTM D 1739 : 82, ASTM D 1739 : 98 and BS 1747 part 5, directional dust deposition gauges) was undertaken monthly over a period of fourteen (14) months at the two sites. The findings of the study indicate that the dust deposition rates for an opencast coal mine are generally higher than the dust deposition rates for an underground gold mine. ASTM D 1739 : 98 was shown to be a more efficient dust deposition collection method than ASTM D 1739 : 82, with the ratio between the mean values slightly more than 2. The addition of water to the <b>dust</b> <b>bucket</b> does not make a statistically significant difference to retention of dust in the bucket. There is a weak correlation between results for the vertical dust gauges and horizontal dust flux. It is recommended that the South African mining sector continue dust deposition monitoring and reporting using the more recent version of ASTM D 1739, as high deposition levels may indicate a potential health impact from PM 10 thoracic dust.

40|$|AbstractLoss of mirror {{reflectivity}} due to soiling at Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) {{plants is}} a significant consideration for design and operation of the plant. Increasingly, a bankable case for establishment of a new plant will include {{an evaluation of the}} cleanliness of the proposed site in addition to the solar resource assessment. The nature and quantity of atmospheric fallout is site specific and generally has a seasonal cycle. We describe an effort which has been underway {{for more than a year}} now for a candidate CSP site cleanliness assessment using <b>dust</b> <b>buckets</b> and loss of reflectivity on mirror samples installed at the site. The loss of reflectivity due to soiling was measured on a monthly cycle using a portable, imaging instrument that was designed and built for this purpose. The design of the instrument is described and typical results are presented...|$|R

40|$|Dust {{emissions}} from mining activities {{and their impact}} on the surrounding environment have been and remain one of the major environmental impacts associated with surface mining. Dust emissions caused by the transportation of mined material on surface mines are the most significant contributor. In previous studies, as much as 93 % of total dust emissions were found to be associated with this activity. Dust emissions not only have a negative environmental impact, but also impact on vehicle maintenance and operating costs, and can affect the health of the surrounding communities. Acontrolled study was conducted on haulage roads to assess the efficacy of using a lignosulphonate-based dust palliative, compared with a water-only strategy to suppress dust. Asection of road that is representative of a typical mine haulage road was chosen for the study. The road was divided into two sections: one section was treated with water only and the other section was treated with a lignosulphonatebased dust palliative. The water-only method was used as the baseline for the study. Operational parameters influencing haulage road dust emissions were monitored and data concerning vehicle frequency, water usage, product application frequency and dust fallout were recorded. Dust fallout on the individual test sections was measured over the study period using non-directional <b>dust</b> <b>buckets,</b> and real-time <b>dust</b> concentrations were measured using a personal Data Ram (pDR).

40|$|Abstract- In all sugar {{industries}} {{the cane}} after processing {{is left with}} the waste product called “Bagasse”. The Bagasse produced in the mills {{is used as a}} fuel to boilers and the generation of steam. The steam thus produced is expanded in turbines and the power is generated. The excess bagasse is then stored in an open area. Lot of human health hazards is taking place due to loading of bagasse. Nowadays, the industries are using the crane systems to load the bagasse into the tippers, which is a very slow task and causing more <b>dust.</b> The <b>bucket</b> conveyors are used to move bulk materials in a vertical or inclined path. Buckets are attached to a cable, chain, or belt. Buckets are automatically unloaded {{at the end of the}} conveyor run. The belt conveyor is used for transporting light- and medium-weight loads between operations, departments, levels, and buildings, providing considerable control over the orientation and placement of the load. The belt is roller or slider bed supported; the slider bed is used for small and irregularly shaped items...|$|R

40|$|A geobotanical and {{environmental}} investigation was undertaken {{to investigate the}} potential for copper poisoning in wild ruminants within the Phalaborwa area in the Kruger National Park and to confirm that environmental copper pollution associated with smelting operations at a nearby mine {{was the source of}} copper responsible for the poisoning. The study area selected was divided into high, moderate and low-risk zones and a control area based on initial topsoil copper concentrations and impala (Aepyceros melampus) liver copper concentrations in relation to distance from the copper smelter. Samples collected revealed that topsoil copper concentrations were significantly higher than subsoil copper concentrations at the same sites. There was a significant linear decrease in topsoil to subsoil copper concentration relative to distance from the copper smelter and thus from the high-risk zone to the control area. Copper concentrations of unwashed plant material were significantly higher than washed plant material at the same sites, indicating the deposition of copper on the plant surfaces. Copper deposits in <b>dust</b> fall <b>buckets</b> were significantly higher downwind than upwind from the smelter stack and the presence of atmospheric copper was also confirmed with the aid of low-volume air sampling monitors. The investigation confirmed that the emissions from the copper smelter were sufficient in amount and appropriate in direction to have contributed significantly to the topsoil copper concentrations, unwashed plant copper concentrations and dust fall results.
