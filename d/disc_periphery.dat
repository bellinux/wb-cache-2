40|$|The {{shape of}} the radial profile of a {{rotating}} disc, is different in the case when a free falling ball collides the disc, presents in the region between the imprint and {{the periphery of the}} disc a different shape from the one it has in the absence of contact. Accepting, in accordance with Saint-Venant’s principle that at distances far enough from the region the load is applied, it doesn’t matter the manner of applying the load, under the hypothesis of the linear elastic behaviour of material and using a FEA software, the phenomenon is modelled. There were considered the cases of the rotating disc without impact, the impact of free falling ball with the resting disc and the impact with the rotating disc and for neither one of the situations the material {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>disc</b> <b>periphery</b> reaches the plastic deformation domain...|$|E
40|$|The {{diffraction}} in {{the acoustic}} field of an ultrasound transducer can be modeled {{as the result}} of the interference of edge and plane waves generated from the periphery and the center of the piezoelectric element, respectively. Our objective in developing ultrasound transducers with apodized piezoelectric ceramic discs was to generate acoustical fields with reduced edge waves interference. Transducer were built with apodized ceramic discs (polarized more intensively in the central region than in the edges) and their mapped acoustic fields showed a distinct pattern when compared to those of conventional transducers. A polynomial equation describing the nonlinear poling field intensity, was used with the Rayleigh equation to simulate the nonuniform vibration amplitude distribution generated by the apodized transducers. Simulated acoustic fields were compared to experimental field mappings. The results of simulations and experimental tests showed reduction in the lateral spreading of acoustic fields produced by apodized transducers, compared to those produced by conventional transducers. The reduced presence of the lateral lobes in the apodized acoustic field is due to the minimized vibration of the <b>disc</b> <b>periphery.</b> The numerical and experimental results were in good agreement and showed that it was possible to reduce acoustic field diffraction through nonlinear polarization of the piezoelectric element...|$|E
40|$|The {{thickness}} of the equilibrium isothermal gaseous layers and their volume densities ρ_gas(R) in the disc midplane are calculated for 7 spiral galaxies (including our Galaxy) {{in the frame of}} self-consistent axisymmetric model. Local velocity dispersions of stellar discs were assumed to be close to marginal values necessary for the discs to be in a stable equilibrium state. Under this condition the stellar discs of at least 5 of 7 galaxies reveal a flaring. Their volume densities decrease with R faster than ρ_gas, and, as a result, the gas dominates by the density at the <b>disc</b> <b>periphery.</b> Comparison of the azimuthally averaged star formation rate SFR with the gas density shows that there is no universal Schmidt law SFR ρ_gas^n, common to all galaxies. Nevertheless, SFR in different galaxies reveals better correlation with the volume gas density than with the column one. Parameter n in the Schmidt law SFR ρ_gas^n, formally calculated by the least square method, lies within 0. 8 - 2. 4 range and it's mean value is close to 1. 5. Values of n calculated for molecular gas only are characterized by large dispersion, but their mean value is close to 1. Hence the smaller ρ_gas the less is a fraction of gas actively taking part in the process of star formation. Comment: 24 pages, 11 figures, to be published in Astronomy Reports, 200...|$|E
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{architecture of}} {{cells in the}} annulus fibrosus was studied by a systematic, histological examination using antibodies to cytoskeletal components, in conjunction with confocal microscopy. Variations in cell shape, arrangement of cellular processes and cytoskeletal architecture were found both within and between the defined zones of the outer and innerannulus. The morphology of three, novel annulus fibrosus cells is described: extended cordlikecells that form an interconnected network at {{the periphery of the}} disc; cells with extensive, sinuous processes in the inner region of the annulus fibrosus; and cells with broad, branching processes specific to the interlamellar septae of the outer annulus. The complex, yet seemingly deliberate arrangement of various cell shapes and their processes suggests multiple functional roles. Regional variations in the organization of the actin and vimentin cytoskeletal networks is reported across all regions of the annulus. Most notable is the continuous, strand arrangement of the actin label at the <b>disc's</b> <b>periphery</b> in contrast to its punctate appearance in all other regions. The gap junction protein connexin 43 was found within cells from all regionsof the annulus, including those which did not form physical connections with surrounding cells. These observations of the cellular matrix in the healthy intervertebral disc should contribute {{to a better understanding of}} site-specific changes in tissue architecture, biochemistry andmechanical properties during degeneration, injury and healing...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{fields are}} {{observed}} beyond the peripheries of optically detected galactic discs, while numerical models of their origin and the typical magnitudes are still absent. Previously, studies of galactic dynamo have avoided considering the <b>peripheries</b> of galactic <b>discs</b> {{because of the}} very limited (though gradually growing) knowledge about the local properties of the interstellar medium. Here we investigate the possibility that magnetic fields can be generated in the outskirts of discs, taking the Milky Way as an example. We consider a simple evolving galactic dynamo model in the "no-z" formulation, applicable to peripheral regions of galaxies, for various assumptions about the radial and vertical profiles of the ionized gas disc. The magnetic field may grow as galaxies evolve, even in the more remote parts of the galactic disc, out to radii of 15 to 30 kpc, becoming substantial after times of about 10 Gyr. This result depends weakly on the adopted distributions of the half thickness and surface density of the ionized gas component. The model is robust {{to changes in the}} amplitude of the initial field and the position of its maximum strength. The magnetic field in the remote parts of the galactic disc could be generated in situ from a seed field by local dynamo action. Another possibility is field production in the central regions of a galaxy, followed by transport to the <b>disc's</b> <b>periphery</b> by the joint action of the dynamo and turbulent diffusivity. Our results demonstrate the possibilities for the appearance and strengthening of magnetic fields at the <b>peripheries</b> of <b>disc</b> galaxies and emphasize the need for observational tests with new and anticipated radio telescopes (LOFAR, MWA, and SKA).

40|$|The {{detection}} {{and the location}} of reaction wood (compression or tension wood) in trees and logs is a major interest for wood industry. In tension wood which has an important thick gelatinous layer (or G - layer) in the cell wall, radial delaminations have been observed in Eucalyptus spp. by Chafe (1977) as local disruptions to the microfibril orientation. On the other hand, the tension wood has lower properties than normal wood because of morphological difference between the lignified secondary wall S 2 and the unlignified G -layer (Donaldson 2001). These structural particularities as well as the disruption of microfibril orientation in tension wood are evident with ultrasonic techniques such as acoustic tomography and ultrasonic velocity method. The detection of tension wood in L direction was performed using a direct transmission ultrasonic technique and measuring the time of flight with 1 MHz probes and calculating the corresponding velocity noted VLL. The corresponding values are higher in tension wood (average 3847 m/s), than in opposite wood (average 3187 m/s), or lateral wood considered as normal wood (average 3544 m/s). The location of tension wood was possible using a stress wave method (frequency 40 kHz) and a linear filtered back projection technique for image reconstruction. A hammer blow was used to produce stress waves and the corresponding signal was strongly amplified. Acoustic waves are emitted sequentially from the source probe position and recorded at receiver source position. Maps were obtained with longitudinal bulk waves when the transducers were inserted in the radial direction to the <b>disc</b> <b>periphery</b> and with surface waves when the transducers were inserted in T direction. The tangential stress wave velocity maps were obtained at different distances from the discs periphery (ex. : 20 mm, 140 mm) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} in this PhD thesis is motivated by the importance of precise microflow control in transforming various laboratory-based chemical and clinical assays into portable centrifugal microfluidics based devices. The more specific aim {{is the development of}} inexpensive flow control and liquid routing techniques {{that can be used in}} sample preparative processes such as blood plasma separation, washing, metering, and analyte detection. Efficient and inexpensive flow control techniques based on new principles and operations are introduced and compared with state of the art industrial approaches. Unlike previously introduced techniques these novel flow control methods are not dependent on the direction of the disk rotation and do not require special surface treatments or external power sources. The hardware to enable these techniques is easy to implement and provides robust control of the flow in centrifugal microfluidic platforms. Prior to designing new capillary valves, a comprehensive investigation of the relationship between contact angles and capillary dimensions on the performance of passive capillary valves was carried out. The results reveal, for example, that square capillaries have lower capillary forces compared to rectangular capillaries. The results also show that -contrary to earlier theoretical predictions- the capillary force at burst valves dramatically drops when the contact angle decreases. For the first time, a new valving technique is introduced that exploits a geometrical effect on the surface tension to control and switch the flow direction. The valve is a frequency dependent device that is able to direct the flow to one direction (e. g., c. w.) at low frequencies and to the opposite direction (e. g., c. c. w.) at higher frequencies without using external power sources or applying surface treatments. The flow behavior of the new valve for distilled water as well as for liquids with different properties was investigated experimentally and numerically. The results show that the new valve is v able to control the flow direction on a spinning microfluidic platform for liquids of widely varying properties. Another novel microvalve is presented that allows for the efficient routing of samples, switching and controlling the flow direction on centrifugal microfluidic platforms. The distinctive feature that makes this approach different from other types of passive capillary valves is the robust control of liquid movement, which is achieved by employing two adjustable sequential burst valves i. e., a primary and a secondary burst valve. The performance of this novel configuration was experimentally tested, the flow behavior was numerically studied using the VOF method and a theoretical model for their burst frequency was presented. For the first time, the role of the effective moment of inertia of the liquid in centrifugal microfluidics – that can be used for pushing the liquid towards specific lateral or/and radial directions – was theoretically, experimentally and numerically investigated. The experiment results confirmed that utilizing the effective moment of inertia of the liquid i. e., as a result of a sudden reduction of the rotational speed (45 Hz/s), propels the entire liquid volume from a chamber adjacent to the <b>disc’s</b> <b>periphery</b> to a chamber close to the disc center...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Actin capping protein (CP) binds barbed ends of actin {{filaments}} {{to regulate}} actin assembly. CP is an �/ � heterodimer. Vertebrates have conserved isoforms of each subunit. Muscle cells contain two � isoforms. � 1 {{is at the}} Z-line; � 2 is at the intercalated <b>disc</b> and cell <b>periphery</b> in general. To investigate {{the functions of the}} isoforms, we replaced one isoform with another using expression in hearts of transgenic mice. Mice expressing � 2 had a severe phenotype with juvenile lethality. Myofibril architecture was severely disrupted. The � 2 did not localize to the Z-line. Therefore, � 1 has a distinct function that includes interactions at the Z-line. Mice expressing � 1 showed altered morphology of the intercalated disc, without the lethality or CAPPING 1 protein (CP) is a heterodimer composed of � and � subunits, which binds to the barbed ends of actin filaments.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of an unusual {{clinical}} presentation of posterior scleritis. A 40 -year-old woman suffered from sudden blurred vision in her left eye for 1 day. She had no systemic or autoimmune diseases. Fundus examination revealed a subretinal mass (10. 5 × 6 mm in basal diameter) in the nasal-superior quadrant extending from the optic <b>disc</b> to the <b>periphery.</b> Overlying retinal striae were obvious. Optic disc hyperemia and mild edema were noted. Fluorescein angiography did not show dye leakage or tumor-feeding vessels. Ultrasonography showed high internal reflectivity of the subretinal mass and thickened sclera with T-sign. Under the impression of posterior scleritis, corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were given orally and topically. After 4 weeks, the subretinal mass disappeared without any sequelae. The patient recovered full vision. This case suggests that posterior scleritis is among the differential diagnoses for a fundus mass. There has been no other similar report in Taiwan...|$|R
40|$|DISPLACEMENT of the macula {{may result}} from {{defective}} growth of the posterior segment of the eye (Mann, 1957; Duke-Elder, 1964) and {{may be associated with}} other congenital abnormalities. Derzhavin (1896) described the first recorded case, with a vascularized band extending from the whole width of the optic <b>disc</b> to the <b>periphery</b> of the retina, which at first formed a retinal fold and then broke free from the retina as a band extending forwards into the vitreous. It has been suggested that this represented remnants of the hyaloid artery. Grondahl (1963) has reported a child with unilateral heterotopia of the macula due to atypical ablatio falciformis congenita. The child described by Woillez, Fran 9 ois, and Lebrun (1960) had a vascularized retinal traction band and was probably a further case of atypical falciform congenital fold producing heterotopia ofthe macula. Triebenstein (1919) ascribed his two cases, in a mother and her son, to congenital causes of a developmental anomaly, though the description of the fundal lesions would suggest that they were post-inflammatory. Cohen and Weisberg (1950) thought that their case of bilateral heterotopia of the macula was due to disturbances in the rate of growth and maturation of the retina...|$|R
40|$|The inflow, or accelerating, or sink flow, is {{realized}} when fluid enters {{the space between}} two flat <b>discs</b> via the <b>periphery</b> and drains through a centrally located outlet. The flow that {{is characterized by a}} monotonically decreasing pressure gradient is known to remain laminar even at very high Reynolds numbers, or to laminarize if the entering fluid is initially turbulent. The outflow, or decelerating, or source flow, is the type of flow where the fluid is admitted through a centrally located inlet and discharged through the periphery. As a result of the area increase, the velocity decreases, and an adverse pressure gradient develops. Analytical and experimental analyses were performed for the inflow and outflow between two discs both with and without swirl. In the analytical study (with and without swirl), it was shown that the radial velocity is expressed only {{as a function of the}} radial location and Reynolds number, whereas the static pressure for the swirling flows depends on the Reynolds number, radial position and swirl strength. The analytical model was also validated with present and previously obtained experimental findings and showed good agreement. An experimental investigation was also carried out to explore the flow between two narrowly spaced discs over the range of low and moderate Reynolds numbers. Radial velocity and static pressure measurements were obtained for the non-swirling inflow and outflow, whereas for the swirling cases only static pressures were acquired. The experimental results were then compared with the present theory and showed good agreement. For the inflow case, the results displayed the characteristics of the accelerating flow, whereas for the outflow case without swirl, the vena contracta effects, as well as the phenomenon of the reverse flow at the inlet region were demonstrate...|$|R
