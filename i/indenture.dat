5|$|Carre's Grammar School is a {{selective}} secondary school for boys in Sleaford, a market town in Lincolnshire, England. Founded on 1 September 1604 by an <b>indenture</b> of Robert Carre, {{the school was}} funded by rents from farmland and run {{by a group of}} trustees. The <b>indenture</b> restricted the endowment to £20 without accounting for inflation, causing the school to decline during the 18th century and effectively close in 1816. Revived by a decree from the Court of Chancery in 1830, new buildings were constructed at its present site and the school re-opened in 1835. Faced with competition from cheaper commercial schools and declining rolls, Carre's eventually added technical and artistic instruction to its Classical curriculum by affiliating with Kesteven County Council in 1895. Following the Education Act 1944, school fees were abolished and Carre's became Voluntary Aided. New buildings were completed in 1966 to house the rising number of students. After plans for comprehensive education in Sleaford came to nothing in the 1970s and 1980s, Carre's converted to grant-maintained status in 1990. Foundation status followed and the school became an Academy in 2011; a multi-Academy trust with Kesteven and Sleaford High School was formed in 2015.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of <b>indentured</b> servants {{ended up in}} the American South, where cash crops necessitated labour-intensive farming. As the Northern colonies moved toward industrialisation, they got significantly less <b>indentured</b> immigration. For example, 96.28% of English emigrants to Virginia and Maryland from 1773 to 1776 were <b>indentured</b> servants. During the same time period, only 1.85% of English emigrants to New England were <b>indentured.</b>|$|R

50|$|The end of debtors' prisons {{may have}} created a limited {{commitment}} pitfall in which <b>indentured</b> servants could agree to contracts with ship captains and then refuse to sell themselves once they arrived in the colonies. Increased lobbying from immigrant aid societies led to increased regulation of the <b>indentured</b> labour market, further increasing the difficulty of enforcing contracts. With less ability to enforce the contracts, demand for <b>indentured</b> servants may have fallen. However, most debtor prisons were still in service when <b>indentured</b> servitude disappeared and many regulations on <b>indentured</b> servitude {{were put in place}} well before the disappearance.|$|R

5|$|Several laws {{dealt with}} indentured servitude, a legal status whereby {{a person would}} work off debts or be given {{training}} {{in exchange for a}} period of unrecompensed service. The law required that all indentured servants had to be registered by the Governor or one of the Assistants, and that no period of <b>indenture</b> could be less than six months. Further laws forbade a master from shortening the length of time of service required for his servant, and also confirmed that any indentured servants whose period of service began in England would still be required to complete their service while in Plymouth.|$|E
5|$|The <b>indenture</b> of 1604 made it {{compulsory}} {{that the}} master be {{a graduate of}} the University of Cambridge or Oxford and the majority of the pre-1835 masters had attended Cambridge, with only two from Oxford.

5000|$|Following the {{abolition}} of slavery in British colonies in the West Indies on 1 August 1838, plantation owners in the region sought to find an alternative to African slave labour. The British began transporting <b>indentured</b> workers from India to work on plantation estates in Saint Kitts and Nevis, which had become British colony in 1713. Saint Kitts and Nevis were the last among British and French colonies to introduce Indian <b>indentured</b> labour. Nevis received 315 Indian <b>indentured</b> workers, the smallest among all the colonies that employed <b>indentured</b> labour. Saint Kitts received the third smallest number (337 workers), after the Dutch colony of St. Croix which received 321 Indian workers. Limited information exists on <b>indentured</b> workers in Saint Kitts. A register that kept records of <b>indentured</b> workers was lost in a fire at the Court House in Saint Kitts in 1982. Some documents related to <b>indentured</b> workers are held at the National Archives in Saint Kitts.|$|R
50|$|India and China {{were the}} {{largest source of}} <b>indentured</b> {{servants}} during the colonial era. <b>Indentured</b> servants from India travelled to British colonies in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean, and also to French and Portuguese colonies, while Chinese servants travelled to British and Dutch colonies. Between 1830 and 1930, around 30 million <b>indentured</b> servants migrated from India, and 24 million returned to India. China sent more <b>indentured</b> servants to European colonies, and around the same proportion returned to China.|$|R

5|$|Education was {{provided}} for the children, but workhouse teachers were a particular problem. Poorly paid, without any formal training, and facing large classes of unruly children {{with little or no}} interest in their lessons, few stayed in the job {{for more than a few}} months. In an effort to force workhouses to offer at least a basic level of education, legislation was passed in 1845 requiring that all pauper apprentices should be able to read and sign their own <b>indenture</b> papers. A training college for workhouse teachers was set up at Kneller Hall in Twickenham during the 1840s, but it closed in the following decade.|$|E
5|$|The {{businessman}} and politician William Smith was appointed Lord Warden in 1891, but died in Walmer Castle {{during his first}} visit here in October of that year. Smith had proposed that the historical artefacts in the castle should be protected from being removed by later Lord Wardens and suggested that government pass an <b>Indenture</b> of Heirlooms Bill. The government carried out the plan after Smith's death, protecting almost 70 pieces of furniture and 50 artworks at the castle and forbidding them being moved from the castle without the Secretary of State for War's approval. Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, the Marquess of Salisbury, became the next Lord Warden; with adequate legal protection now in place, the 3rd Duke of Wellington suggested returning his grandfather's possessions to the castle, but Lady Salisbury declined the offer.|$|E
25|$|It can {{be assumed}} that except for the Parcels Clause, the Great Grant <b>indenture</b> {{document}} and the Path Grant <b>indenture</b> document are identical. This assumption is not unreasonable because {{with the exception of}} the Parcels clause, the Recital Clause, all the purchasers, the various nine tenants in common, the Cherokee chiefs and all the deed structural elemental clauses were all the same.|$|E
50|$|When the <b>indentured</b> {{labor law}} was designed, it {{provided}} the <b>indentured</b> laborer some rights {{at the end}} of the contract; the laborer became free, with the legal right to some land and the right to stay in the new land, or demand the company or plantation owner for pre-paid travel back. However, in late 1880s South Africa, new laws were passed that required that the newly freed <b>indentured</b> laborer pay a hefty tax, or sign a new <b>indentured</b> labor contract and escape the tax. About 25% of Hindus returned to India, once their first contract was over. But for most <b>indentured</b> Hindu laborers, they had lost all contact with their country of origin, chose to stay and signed a new <b>indentured</b> contract. It is this system that brought large number of Hindus (and Southeast Asians) into South Africa.|$|R

These servants provided up to seven years of service in exchange for having their trip to Jamestown paid for by someone in Jamestown. Once the seven years was over, the <b>indentured</b> servant was free to live in Jamestown as a regular citizen. However, colonists began to see <b>indentured</b> servants as too costly, and in 1619, Dutch traders brought the first African slaves to Jamestown, who nonetheless were in North America at first generally treated as <b>indentured</b> servants.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Indentured</b> {{servitude}} in Pennsylvania (1682-1820s): The {{institution of}} <b>indentured</b> servitude {{has a significant}} place {{in the history of}} labor in Pennsylvania. From the founding of the colony (1681/2) to the early post-revolution period (1820s), <b>indentured</b> servants contributed considerably to the development of agriculture and various industries in Pennsylvania. Moreover, Pennsylvania itself has a notable place in the broader history of <b>indentured</b> servitude in North America. As Cheesman Herrick stated, [...] "This system of labor was more important to Pennsylvania than it was to any other colony or state; it continued longer in Pennsylvania than elsewhere." ...|$|R
25|$|The Indian <b>indenture</b> {{system was}} an ongoing system of <b>indenture,</b> {{a form of}} debt bondage, by which 3.5million Indians were transported to various colonies of European powers to provide labour for the (mainly sugar) plantations. It started {{from the end of}} slavery in 1833 and {{continued}} until 1920. This resulted in the development of large Indian diaspora, which spread from the Indian Ocean (i.e. Réunion and Mauritius) to Pacific Ocean (i.e. Fiji), as well as the growth of Indo-Caribbean and Indo-African population.|$|E

25|$|As many indentured {{workers were}} illiterate, {{especially}} Africans, there were opportunities for abuse by planters and other <b>indenture</b> holders. Some ignored the expiration of servants' indentured contracts {{and tried to}} keep them as lifelong workers. One example is with Anthony Johnson, who argued with Robert Parker, another planter, over the status of John Casor, formerly an indentured servant of his. Johnson argued that his <b>indenture</b> was for life and Parker had interfered with his rights. The court {{ruled in favor of}} Johnson and ordered that Casor be returned to him, where he served {{the rest of his life}} as a slave. Such documented cases marked the transformation of Negroes from indentured servants into slaves.|$|E
50|$|By 1650, {{there were}} about 300 Africans living in Virginia, about 1% of an {{estimated}} 30,000 population of people of English and European ancestry. They were not slaves but worked as <b>indentured</b> laborers, as did the approximately 4000 white <b>indentured</b> servants working out their loans for passage money to Virginia. Many Africans had earned their freedom, and they were each granted 50 acre of land when freed from their <b>indentures,</b> so they could raise their own tobacco or other crops. Although at a disadvantage in {{that they had to}} pay to have their newly acquired land surveyed in order to patent it, white <b>indentured</b> servants found themselves in the same predicament. Some black <b>indentured</b> servants patented and bought land after gaining freedom.|$|R
50|$|Labour substitutions {{may have}} led {{employers}} away from <b>indentured</b> servants and towards slaves or paid employees. In many places, African slaves became cheaper for unskilled and then eventually skilled labour, and most farmhand positions previously filled by <b>indentured</b> servants were ultimately filled by slaves. Wage labourers {{may have been more}} productive, since employers were more willing to terminate waged employment. In comparison, firing an <b>indentured</b> servant would mean a loss on the original capital investment spent purchasing the servant’s contract. Either substitution would lead to a decrease in demand for <b>indentured</b> servitude. An additional problem for employers was that, compared to African slaves, European <b>indentured</b> servants who ran away could not always be easily distinguished from the general white population, so they were more difficult to re-capture.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to {{leading to the}} distribution of too much land at the lax secretary's discretion, the headright system increased tensions between Native Americans and colonists. <b>Indentured</b> servants were granted land inland, which was near the natives. This migration produced conflict between the natives and the <b>indentured</b> servants. Later, Bacon's Rebellion was sparked by tensions between the natives, settlers, and <b>indentured</b> servants.|$|R
25|$|Article VI of the Articles of Compact {{within the}} Northwest Ordinance {{prohibited}} the owning of slaves within the Northwest Territory. However, territorial governments evaded this law {{by use of}} <b>indenture</b> laws. The Articles of Compact prohibited legal {{discrimination on the basis}} of religion within the territory.|$|E
25|$|The {{business}} of the company was the settlement of the Virginia colony, supported by a labour force of voluntary transportees under the customary <b>indenture</b> system.

25|$|The {{merits and}} {{deficiencies}} of French colonial presence in India is disputed on {{accounts of the}} exploitative nature of colonial trade, segregation of French subjects within the colonial possessions along ethnic lines (Europeans and Creoles were differentiated from ethnic Indians on electoral lists) and the colonial use of <b>indenture</b> labour.|$|E
50|$|<b>Indentured</b> labourers on sugar {{plantations}} {{were frequently}} mistreated, {{and lived in}} unsanitary conditions. A large percentage of <b>indentured</b> labourers returned to India following the expiry of their terms, {{and some of those}} who returned alerted authorities in India to abuses taking place in Natal, which led to new safeguards being put in place before further recruiting of <b>indentured</b> labourers was allowed to take place.|$|R
50|$|Work {{forces on}} iron {{plantations}} {{consisted of a}} wide array of labor and included <b>indentured</b> servants, slaves, and free laborers. <b>Indentured</b> servants composed the largest group. <b>Indentured</b> servants and slaves typically performed the least skilled tasks on plantations, serving as woodcutters to supply the charcoal furnaces or as miners to dig iron ore. Few opportunities were afforded to laborers for upwards mobility on plantations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Indentured</b> {{servitude}} can {{be described}} as an arrangement in which one party agrees to serve another for a certain number of years in exchange for an initial payment or monetary outlay. In colonial and early-republican Pennsylvania, statutes governing the institution established both protections for and restrictions upon <b>indentured</b> servants. While masters could not wield unlimited authority over their servants, the latter was nevertheless subject to various constraints upon their freedom. In fact, <b>indentured</b> servants essentially bore the status of property. However, while these details help in generally understanding <b>indentured</b> servitude, the various forms of the system need to be mentioned as well.|$|R
