40|$|The {{intrinsic}} rigidities of DNA and RNA helices {{are generally}} thought to arise from {{some combination of}} vertical base-stacking interactions and intra-helix phosphate–phosphate charge repulsion; however, the relative contributions of {{these two types of}} inter-action to helix rigidity have not been quantified.

Upon addition of meA, the bases pair with the T residues, forming a continuous stack within the gap region. Formation of the gapped duplex is accompanied by a nearly 2 -fold increase in decay time, to values that are indistinguishable from the full <b>duplex</b> <b>control</b> for monovalent salt concentrations up to 90 mM.

40|$|The {{differential}} binding of {{a number}} of water-soluble cationic porphyrins to a branched DNA molecule is reported. Tetrakis(4 -N-methylpyridiniumy 1) porphine (H₂TMpyP- 4) interacts near the branch point with an immobile DNA junction formed from four 16 -mer strands. Its Cu(I 1) and Ni(I 1) derivatives show stronger preferential binding in the neighborhood of the branch point. Axially liganded derivatives, Zn, Co, and Mn, also interact near this branch point, but in a different way. We use the reagents methidiumpropyl-EDTAoFe(I 1) [MPE. Fe(II) ] and bis(o-phenanthroline) copper(I) [(OP) ₂,Cu(I) ] to cleave complexes of DNA <b>duplex</b> <b>controls</b> and the junction with these porphyrins. The resulting cleavage patterns are consistent with previous evidence that the branch point provides a strong site for intercalative binding agents, which is not available in unbranched duplexes of identical sequence. The preferential scission by (OP) ₂Cu(I) in the presence of Ni and Cu porphyrins near the branch point exceeds that seen for any agents we have studied. This hyperreactivity is not seen in the case of porphyrins with axial ligands, ZnTMpyP- 4, CoTMpyP- 4, and MnTMpyP- 4, although these also interact near the branch point. The Zn derivative tends to protect sites close to the branch point from cutting, while the Co and Mn porphyrins moderately enhance cleavage of sites in this region...|$|R

Tumescent anesthesia (50 - 150 ml of 0. 2 % lidocaine) was delivered perivenously. Power and duration of the pulse were determined by vein diameter. <b>Duplex</b> <b>control</b> was performed at 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and yearly thereafter to assess treatment efficacy and adverse effects. Results: Primary great saphenous vein occlusion was obtained in 405 of 417 members (97. 1 %). Twelve recurrent cases (2. 9 %) were successfully treated. Mean follow-up time was 18 months. During this period, global recurrence rate of varicose veins was 7. 4 %; 6. 3 % (26 limbs) related to tributary and collateral veins of the saphenofemoral junction, and 1. 2 % (five limbs) with great saphenous vein recanalization. All recurrences occurred between 3 and 12 months. Ecchymosis {{was the most common}} adverse effect (60. 6 %). Other complications were: moderate pain during the procedure (16. 1 %); hematoma (5. 5 %), superficial phlebitis of varicose tributaries (3. 4 %), hyperpigmentation (2. 9 %), transient paresthesia (3. 4 %). There were no cases of great saphenous vein thrombophlebitis, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary emboli.

The first consists of the two strands dA 20 and dT 20, and an equimolar complex between them. The second is a short four-arm branched DNA complex composed of four 16 -mer strands. In the former case, cleavage of the 1 : 1 complex by three reagents with different formal charge, Fe(II). EDTA 2 -, Fe(II). EDDA and Fe 2 +, is comparable in rate to that of the individual dT 20 and the dA 20 strands. While the three reagents show similar cleavage rates for the duplex and single stranded molecules, they give distinctive cutting patterns in the DNA tetramer, consistent with the presence of a site of excess negative charge at the branch point. Scission induced by Fe(II). EDTA 2 - shows lower reactivity at the branch site relative to <b>duplex</b> <b>controls,</b> whereas Fe(II) 2 + shows enhanced reactivity. Formally neutral Fe(II).

MethodsThis was a randomised patient controlled double blind study. Sample size calculations required 16 patients. Their median age was 54 and 11 were women. The median CEAP class was 3. At operation one leg, chosen at random, was treated with VNUS and avulsions using intra-operative <b>duplex</b> <b>control.</b> The other leg was treated with traditional RGS, exposure of the femoral vein, stripping of the LSV and multiple avulsions. Post-operatively patients completed 10 cm visual analogue scales for pain and bruising. Digital Image {{analysis was used to}} objectively assess bruising. Statistical analysis was done using Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired data. Results are expressed as median values (inter-quartile ranges). ResultsTime to perform VNUS was 25. 5 (20. 5 – 31. 3) min compared with 40 (34. 5 – 45. 5) min it took for RGS (p= 0. 02). Pain score for VNUS was 1. 7 (0. 2 – 4), significantly lower than that for RGS 3. 8 (0. 6 – 6. 3) (p= 0. 02). Bruise score for VNUS was 1. 7 (0. 4 – 4. 4), and that for RGS was 5. 2 (2. 6 – 7) (p= 0. 03). All LSVs were sealed by VNUS at duplex follow up. Three legs in the RGS group and two in the VNUS group had a minor complication. ConclusionsVNUS caused less pain and bruising and was performed more quickly than RGS.

40|$|Uncorrected OCR) Abstract of thesis {{entitled}} Improving the Performance of Lifts Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques {{submitted by}} Wong King Sau for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Hong Kong in August 2003 An elevator group control system manages multiple elevators to serve hall calls in a building. Most elevator group control systems need to recognize the traffic pattern {{of the building and}} then change their control algorithms to improve the efficiency of the elevator system. However, the traffic flow in a building is very difficult to be classified into distinct patterns. Traffic recognition systems can recognize certain traffic patterns, but mixed traffic patterns are difficult to be recognized. The aim of this study was therefore to develop improved duplex elevator group control systems that do not need to recognize the traffic pattern. A fuzzy logic. control unit and genetic algorithms control unit were used. A fuzzy logic control unit integrates with the conventional duplex elevator group control system to improve performance especially in mixed traffic patterns with intermittent heavy traffic demand. This system will send more than one elevator to a floor with heavy demand,. according to the overall passenger traffic conditions in the building. The genetic algorithms control unit divides the building into three zones and assigns an appropriate number of elevators to each zone. The floors covered by each zone are adjusted every five minutes. This control unit optimizes elevator group control by equalizing the number of hall calls in each zone, the total elevator door opening time in each zone, and the number of floors served by each elevator. Both of the control units were tested by a simulator in a computer. The performance of the elevator system is given by indices such as average waiting time, wasted man-hour, and long waiting time percentage. The new performance index "wasted man-hour" indicates the total time spent by passengers in a building waiting for the lift service. Both proposed systems perform better than the conventional <b>duplex</b> <b>control</b> system.

40|$|ObjectivesMajor tissue loss {{caused by}} the {{critical}} limb ischemia requires improvement of distal perfusion and cover of large tissue defects. We propose a new method, the y-shaped subscapular artery flow-through (Y-SCAFT) muscle flap using the subscapular artery that yields an arterial graft and a free muscle flap sustained by a collateral branch of this artery. This prospective study evaluated the feasibility of this technique and analyzed wound healing, graft patency, and limb salvage. MethodsBetween 2002 and 2007, 20 patients, mean age 64 years (range, 55 - 79 years), were treated with this technique. All presented with critical ischemia and major tissue loss, with exposure of the tendons, bones, or joint, and were candidates for major amputation. Revascularization and cover of tissue loss with the same Y-SCAFT anatomic unit was used for all patients. The distal anastomosis was performed between the distal branch of the Y-SCAFT and the pedal artery in 9, posterior tibial artery in 4, peroneal artery in 1, lateral tarsal artery in 3, and the plantar artery in 3. In four patients, the distal part of the arterial graft, including the anastomosis, was covered with the muscle flap because the tissue loss was nearby. The proximal anastomosis was performed between a leg artery and the arterial graft in 10 patients. A venous graft was necessary in 10 patients to extend the bypass proximally. ResultsOne patient died during the postoperative period. <b>Duplex</b> <b>control</b> evidenced patency all the Y-SCAFT muscle flaps. Healing was achieved in all patients. Mean follow-up was 31 months (range, 6 - 58 months). No patients died during follow-up. One patient presented occlusion of the Y-SCAFT muscle flap and underwent amputated. One patient had major amputation despite a patent graft. At 2 years, leg salvage was 85 %, patency was 94 %, and survival was 94 %. At {{the end of the}} follow-up, 17 patients (1 death, 2 amputations) had a patent graft, a viable muscle flap, wound healing, and a functional leg. ConclusionWe showed the clinical feasibility of the technique of Y-SCAFT muscle flap, which allows for revascularization and cover of major tissue loss with one anatomic unit. This method is particularly useful in selected cases with poor run-off and large ischemic lesions...|$|E

The stereoisomers of each complex were isolated by means of cation-exchange chromatography and characterisation was achieved using 1 H NMR and CD spectroscopy. Fluorescent Intercalator Displacement (FID) assays were used to survey to relative binding affinities of this array of complexes to a library of oligonucleotides incorporating a variety of different duplex, bulge, hairpin loop and quadruplex-forming sequences. Notable trends were observed with respect to terminal ligand identity (increased hydrophobicity typically correlated to stronger binding), bridging ligand identity (the “angular” class of complex was usually the strongest binding), and stereochemistry (the meso diastereoisomer of a given complex typically demonstrated the greatest affinity). Additionally, the metal complexes generally demonstrated a heightened affinity for more open oligonucleotide structures such as bulges and loops, as well as AT-rich duplex sequences. A small number of discrepancies were noted in the results of the FID assays wherein the relative order of binding affinity implied by the FID assay contradicted that suggested by other experiments (NMR, equilibrium dialysis, affinity chromatography). These discrepancies were rectified by replacing the intercalating dye used in the assay (ethidium bromide) with the minor groove-binder DAPI (4 ′, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole), the binding mode of which more closely resembles that of the metal complexes being investigated. Electronic absorption titration experiments conducted with several of the complexes and calf thymus DNA confirmed the correlations between ligand identity and stereochemistry seen in the FID (and modified DAPI-displacement) assays. Intrinsic binding constants obtained from these titrations were within the range of mid- 104 to low- 105 M- 1, consistent with previously published values for dinuclear complex-calf thymus DNA interactions. Analogous titrations using yeast tRNA yielded binding constants of a similar magnitude, but in these experiments no clear relationship was evident between the nature of a given complex and its binding affinity. One- and two-dimensional NMR experiments were used to probe in greater detail several of the more notable metal complex-oligonucleotide interactions (as implied by the results of the FID assays). These experiments confirmed the minor groove-binding nature of this genre of metal complex and reaffirmed the oligonucleotide selectivities implied by the FID assays. [Ru(bpy) 22 (μ-bpm) ] 4 + and [Ru(Me 2 bpy) 22 (μ-bpm) ] 4 + were found to bind poorly to a <b>duplex</b> <b>control</b> sequence d(CCGGAATTCCGG) 2 and relatively weakly to the analogous sequence possessing a single-base bulge d(CCGAGAATTCCGG) 2 and an octadecanucleotide containing a four-base hairpin loop d(CACTGGTCTCTACCAGTG), all consistent with the affinities demonstrated by these particular complexes in the FID experiments. Conversely, the meso diastereoisomers of [Ru(phen) 22 (μ-HAT) ] 4 + and [Ru(Me 2 phen) 22 (μ-HAT) ] 4 + confirmed their strong affinities to a six-base hairpin loop sequence d(CACTGGTCTCTCTACCAGTG). Each complex bound strongly to the stem-loop interface of the icosanucleotide as evidenced by selective broadening of T-methyl and aromatic resonances corresponding to protons within the loop/stem-loop interface. The extent of broadening observed in these NMR experiments, coupled with the performance of each complex in the FID assays, suggests a stronger yet less selective interaction by the Me 2 phenversion of the complex. This significant broadening of both the icosanucleotide and metal complex spectra prohibited a thorough NOESY characterisation of the binding, but the few NOE signals that were obtained confirmed binding of the complexes at the stem-loop interface and facilitated the construction of molecular models of each interaction. NMR experiments were also used to investigate the unexpectedly-favourable association meso-[Ru(phen) 22 (μ-ppz) ] 4 + and the duplex oligonucleotide sequence d(ATATATATATAT) 2. Again, both the metal complex and oligonucleotide spectra exhibited significant broadening upon interaction, suggesting moderate-to-strong binding. Furthermore, several resonances corresponding to terminal phenanthroline ligand protons underwent large upfield shifts. NOESY spectra revealed many strong NOE interactions between the terminal ligands of the complex and minor groove sugar resonances, assisting the development of a binding model. The high selectivity of meso-[Ru(phen) 22 (μ-ppz) ] 4 + for AT-rich regions of duplex DNA was confirmed using a restriction enzyme inhibition assay wherein the metal complex was found to interfere with the action of a restriction endonuclease that cuts doublestranded DNA {{at the center of a}} TATA sequence. The impressive selectivity inherent in many of these oligonucleotide-metal complex interactions has been exploited in the development of a DNA-based affinity chromatography technique for the highly efficient separation of different polypyridylruthenium(II) complexes, as well as the stereoisomers of individual complexes. Separations requiring effective column lengths in excess of 30 m on a cation-exchange column have been replicated using a column length of less than 5 cm. This technique has proven useful in qualitatively establishing relative binding affinities between complexes and a variety of oligonucleotides (duplex and nonduplex), and was one of the tools used to confirm the validity of the DAPI-modified fluorescent dye-displacement assay. These studies demonstrate the utility of this genre of rigid dinuclear metal complexes as sequence- and structure-selective probes of nucleic acids. Honing and targeting this selectivity to specific biologically-relevant targets through a rational choice of ligands, functionality and stereochemistry may potentially yield a new generation of more efficacious diagnostic and therapeutic agents...|$|E

Thiolated nucleic acids were covalently linked to glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) by using N-[(1 -maleimidocapropyloxy)sulphosuccinimide ester] as a bifunctional crosslinker. The GOx/HRP enzyme cascade was organized on 2 D hexagonal DNA strips via self-assembly. The distance between two enzymes was controlled by varying the positions of two free DNA tethers on the hexagonal DNA strips. The complementary DNA-conjugated enzymes organized on the two-hexagon strips (shorter distances) showed 1.2 -fold higher activity than the four-hexagon strips. With shorter distances, intermediate (H 2 O 2) diffusion was more efficient, which therefore resulted in increased cascade reaction efficiency. However, the enzyme cascade was not activated {{in the absence of}} the DNA scaffolds or in the presence of foreign DNA [122]. These observations indicate that spatial arrangement at the nanometer scale using a 2 D nanostructure comprising a rigid DNA <b>duplex</b> could <b>control</b> the flux of an intermediate from a primary enzyme to a secondary enzyme and that the flux control dominated the multienzyme cascade reaction rate.|$|R
40|$|Nucleic acids {{are finding}} {{applications}} in nanotechnology as nanomaterials, mechanical devices, templates, and biosensors. G-quadruplex DNA, formed by pi-pi stacking of guanine (G) quartets, {{is an attractive}} alternative to regular B-DNA because of the kinetic and thermodynamic stability of quadruplexes. However, they suffer from a fatal flaw: the rules of recognition, i. e., {{the formation of a}} G-quartet in which four identical bases are paired, prevent the controlled assembly between different strands, leading to complex mixtures. In this report, we present the solution to this recognition problem. The proposed design combines two DNA elements: parallel-stranded duplexes and a quadruplex core. Parallel-stranded <b>duplexes</b> direct <b>controlled</b> assembly of the quadruplex core, and their strands present convenient points of attachments for potential modifiers. The exceptional stability of the quadruplex core provides integrity to the entire structure, which {{could be used as a}} building block for nucleic acid-based nanomaterials. As a proof of principle for the design 2 ̆ 7 s versatility, we assembled quadruplex-based 10 structures and visualized them using atomic force and transmission electron microscopy.

We studied {{the presence of}} hemosiderin in the urine to assess if this {{could be used as}} a biochemical marker for CVI. Hereby we present a case control study conducted in a tertiary care centre in South India. There were 100 cases with evidence of advanced CVI (the Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology classification: C 5, C 6) confirmed by <b>duplex</b> scanning. <b>Controls</b> were 50 patients with leg ulcers due to other etiologies. All patients were subjected to urinary hemosiderin testing. In all 100 patients with CVI (C 5 and C 6 disease) axial venous reflux was confirmed by duplex ultrasound. Superficial venous reflux was noted in 71 % of patients and deep venous reflux in 54. %. Primary {{venous insufficiency}} was the etiology in 81 % of patients. Only 4 / 100 patients had detectable amounts of hemosiderin in the urine. Urine hemosiderin testing to determine presence or absence of CVI yielded the following values: positive predictive value- 80 %; negative predictive value- 33 %; sensitivity- 4 % and specificity- 98 %. The test could not be recommended as a marker of CVI. In Indian patients urinary hemosiderin is not a useful screening test in CVI...|$|R
40|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}} (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are considered uncommon in Asian populations and thrombo-prophylaxis is rarely indicated. The {{objective of this}} study was to investigate the incidence of DVT and PE after total knee replacement in an Asian population. Material and Method: There were 100 patients who underwent total knee replacement enrolled in this study. No thrombo-prophylaxis was given to these patients. The possible risk factors such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), operative time and the post-operative blood loss were recorded. Results: The <b>duplex</b> ultrasonography (<b>controlled)</b> showed no evidence of DVT in all cases. There were 67 patients who completed radionuclide venography in this study. The incidence of DVT from positive radionuclide venography was 24 % (16 / 67 patients) and PE was 12 % (8 / 67 patients). All patients with positive imaging studies were asymptomatic. The risk factors were similar in both groups. Conclusion: The incidence of DVT and PE in post-operative total knee replacement surgery, although lower than the incidence in Western populations, is higher than previously assumed. The radionuclide venography is less invasive and a useful diagnostic method for both DVT and PE. Because all patients with DVT and PE are asymptomatic, the use of thrombo-prophylaxis should be considered for risk and benefit...|$|R

Clinical ergotism is rarely observed and can affect all the arteries, especially of the inferior limbs. Vasospasm of the peripheral arteries and collateral formation are specific findings on angiography. We report the illustrative case of a 38 years old woman hospitalized for a small bowel occlusion. She suffers from chronic migraine treated by ergotamine tartrate. During her hospitalization, she develops an acute ischemia of the lower limbs. An ergotism was clinically suspected and confirmed by Duplex sonography which demonstrate multiple vasospasm. Under iv sodium nitroprusside and peridural analgesia the spasm resolved in 24 hours.

40|$|A {{combined}} hybrid automatic repeat request (ARQ) {{error control}} and adaptive scheduling scheme is proposed for time-division multiple access/time-division <b>duplex</b> medium access <b>control</b> (MAC) protocols in wireless {{asynchronous transfer mode}} (ATM) networks. Specifically, {{with the aid of}} proper channel modeling, the performance of various error-control schemes is evaluated. Accordingly, type-H hybrid ARQ is chosen as the error recovery scheme to combat fading effects, while adaptive fair-queueing is designed to achieve a fair and efficient resource allocation in wireless channels. In particular, the weight. of a connection used, in the fair-queueing algorithm dynamically adapts in terms of varying channel conditions and the types of services. Various simulations are conducted in typical indoor wireless ATM networks. It is shown that the proposed scheme in this paper can achieve a high throughput and transfer reliability with minimized delay and cell loss rate when compared with the conventional MAC layer control...|$|R
40|$|SummaryPoxviruses encode {{their own}} type IB topoisomerases (TopIBs), which release superhelical tension {{generated}} by replication and transcription of their genomes. To investigate the reaction catalyzed by viral TopIBs, we have determined {{the structure of}} a variola virus topoisomerase-DNA complex trapped as a vanadate transition state mimic. The structure reveals how the viral TopIB enzymes are likely to position the DNA duplex for ligation following relaxation of supercoils and identifies the sources of friction observed in single-molecule experiments that argue against free rotation. The structure also identifies a conformational change in the leaving group sugar that must occur prior to cleavage and reveals a mechanism for promoting ligation following relaxation of supercoils that involves an Asp-minor groove interaction. Overall, the new structural data support a common catalytic mechanism for the TopIB superfamily but indicate distinct methods for <b>controlling</b> <b>duplex</b> rotation in the small versus large enzyme subfamilies...|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{appreciated}} that gene expression is regulated by protein complexes at promoters. More recently, {{research has demonstrated that}} small duplex RNAs such as micro-RNAs and short interfering RNAs complementary to mRNA provide another layer of regulation. Evidence now supports the existence of regulatory pathways that use small <b>duplex</b> RNAs to <b>control</b> transcription. Synthetic RNAs complementary to gene promoters [antigene RNAs (agRNAs) ] can either activate or inhibit gene expression. Activity of agRNAs is mediated by argonaute, a protein required for RNA interference. Unlike protein transcription factors, agRNAs do not bind to chromosomal DNA but recognize noncoding transcripts that overlap gene promoters or 3 ′-gene termini. This review describes recent studies with agRNAs and focuses on the robust and potent agRNA-mediated regulation of progesterone receptor. The ability of small RNAs to alter transcription provides a new layer of potential regulation for gene expression...|$|R

In this report, we extend and generalize these observations and show that this dye may be used as a convenient and specific quadruplex probe. In the presence of most, but not all, G 4 -forming sequences, we observed a large increase in ThT fluorescence emission, whereas the presence of <b>control</b> <b>duplexes</b> and single strands had a more limited effect on emission. This differential behavior allowed us to design a high-throughput assay to detect G 4 formation.
