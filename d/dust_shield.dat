50|$|The guide cap {{is fixed}} {{with the help}} of a steel circlip. However in the new design of Axle box guide, the guide cap is welded with the guide {{assembly}} and hence the need of a guide cap has been eliminated. The complete guide and lower spring arrangement is covered with a dashpot cover also known as protective tube. The protective tube has a circular ring over it called the <b>dust</b> <b>shield</b> which prevents the ingress of the dust in the cylinder piston arrangement of the dashpot.|$|E

50|$|At {{such high}} speeds {{incident}} debris {{would be a}} major hazard. While accelerating, Valkyrie uses a device that combines the functions of a particle shield and a liquid droplet radiator. Waste heat is dumped into liquid droplets that are cast {{out in front of the}} ship. As the ship accelerates the droplets (now cool) effectively fall back into the ship, so the system is self-recycling. During deceleration the ship will be protected by ultra-thin umbrella shields, augmented by a <b>dust</b> <b>shield,</b> possibly made by grinding up pieces of the discarded first stage.|$|E
50|$|The {{cornerstone}} of the A-556 rifle design is the piston operating system. A gas-driven piston is incorporated into {{the upper half of}} the forward rail system and never touches the barrel. This makes the barrel free-floating, which increases accuracy. The operating rod is connected to the bolt carrier group and rides through a machined boss in the receiver rail system interface, keeping the bolt carrier in a linear plane as it operates. This eliminates carrier tilt. A spring-loaded <b>dust</b> <b>shield</b> mounted on the bolt carrier allows the bolt carrier to return to ready position. The port dust wiper moves into the ejection port opening flush of the upper receiver.|$|E

5000|$|Respiratory {{equipment}} and dust collection systems {{are also important}} when woodturning or doing any type of woodworking that creates dust. This can range from a simple disposable dust mask, to a full face helmet with built in respirator. Most stand alone respiratory equipment will interfere with <b>dust</b> <b>shields</b> and visors, so devices that incorporate both are available. Many woods create dust that is actually a health hazard. For example, cocobolo (granadillo) dust {{is known to be}} toxic (toxic shock). Many people are sensitive to oils carried in walnut, locust, and oak sawdust. Long term exposure to fine wood dust has also been linked with an increased risk of developing cancer.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} line overlap in the Lyman and Werner bands, often ignored in galactic {{studies of the}} atomic-to-{{molecular}} transition, greatly enhances molecular hydrogen self-shielding in low metallicity environments, and dominates over <b>dust</b> <b>shielding</b> for metallicities below about 10 % solar. We implement that effect in cosmological hydrodynamics simulations with an empirical model, calibrated against the observational data, and provide fitting formulae for the molecular hydrogen fraction {{as a function of}} gas density on various spatial scales and in environments with varied dust abundance and interstellar radiation field. We find that line overlap, while important for detailed radiative transfer in the Lyman and Werner bands, has only a minor effect on star formation on galactic scales, which, to a much larger degree, is regulated by stellar feedback.

50|$|The {{cruise speed}} of the Von Braun is 20% the speed of light. At this speed it reaches the planet Darwin IV in 42 years. The Von Braun, named after Wernher von Braun, has two primary {{propulsion}} systems: nuclear ion engines for low-speed maneuvers {{during the first year}} of spaceflight and an antimatter catalyst to accelerate to 20% the speed of light. Once in orbit it deploys the Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter and the landing probes. It also has artificial intelligence computers to act as the central command for the mission. During the long cruise to Darwin IV, a metal-composite <b>dust</b> <b>shield</b> protects the spacecraft from interstellar debris. It is jettisoned before Von Braun brakes in orbit around Darwin IV. Finally, it has a 165 ft diameter communications dish, deployed in orbit, for information transfer to Earth. It transfers a large amount of information via a laser beam at a frequency of 8 GHz in the X-band.|$|E

In this paper, several robotic challenges are presented to represent some of the challenges faced within a collapsed building. A robotic mechanism, termed the sweep-extend mechanism is proposed {{as a means for}} mobile {{search and rescue}} robots to clear a path through loose debris. The mechanism has been mounted on a mobile platform and tested against the proposed scenarios. The mechanism was demonstrated to move debris, such as bricks, away from the path of the robot.

40|$|As {{longwall}} shields {{are lowered}} {{in preparation for}} advance, dust from the canopy falls directly into the air stream with the potential of becoming entrained. Historical dust sampling data from the early 1980 s shows that shield advance contributed an average of 12 percent to the airborne respirable dust levels found on longwalls in the United States. Data from the 1990 s indicates that <b>shield</b> <b>dust</b> liberation had increased {{to an average of}} 23 percent. Increased longwall production levels over this time resulted in the need to move a larger number of shields during each shift, while an increase in air velocities on the face was also occurring.

A series of controlled laboratory tests were conducted in a test stand simulating <b>shield</b> <b>dust</b> entrainment to evaluate changes in airborne respirable dust levels at different air velocities.

40|$|Mars {{is covered}} with a layer of dust that has been homogenized by global dust storms. Dust, levitated by these storms {{as well as by the}} {{frequent}} dust devils, is the dominant weather phenomenon on Mars. NASA's Mars exploration rovers have shown that atmospheric dust falling on solar panels can decrease their efficiency to the point of rendering the rover unusable. Dust covering the surface of the moon is expected to be electrostatically charged due to the solar wind, cosmic rays, and the solar radiation itself through the photoelectric effect. Electrostatically charged dust has a large tendency to adhere to surfaces. The Apollo missions to the moon showed that lunar dust adhesion can hinder manned and unmanned exploration activities. In this paper, we report on our efforts to develop and electrodynamic <b>dust</b> <b>shield</b> to prevent the accumulation of dust on surfaces and to remove dust already adhering to those surfaces. The technology uses electrostatic and dielectrophoretic forces to carry dust particles off surfaces and to generate an electrodynamic shield that prevents further accumulation of dust. The concept of the electrodynamic <b>dust</b> <b>shield</b> was introduced by NASA in the late 1960 s and later reduced to practice during the 1970 s for terrestrial applications. In 2003, our laboratory, in collaboration with several universities, applied this technology to space applications, specifically to remove dust from solar panels on Mars. We show how, with an appropriate design, we can prevent the electrostatic breakdown at the low Martian atmospheric pressures. We are also able to show that uncharged dust can be lifted and removed from surfaces under simulated Martian environmental conditions. We have also been able to develop a version of the electrodynamic <b>dust</b> <b>shield</b> working under hard vacuum conditions that simulate the lunar environment.

5000|$|The harmful {{properties}} of lunar dust {{are not well}} known. However, based on studies of dust found on Earth, {{it is expected that}} exposure to lunar dust will result in greater risks to health both from direct exposure (acute) and if exposure is over time (chronic). This is because lunar dust is more chemically reactive and has larger surface areas composed of sharper jagged edges than Earth dust. If the chemical reactive particles are deposited in the lungs, they may cause respiratory disease. Long-term exposure to the dust may cause a more serious respiratory disease similar to silicosis. During lunar exploration, the astronauts' spacesuits will become contaminated with lunar dust. The dust will be released into the atmosphere when the suits are removed. The methods used to mitigate exposure will include providing high air recirculation rates in the airlock, the use of a [...] "Double Shell Spacesuit", the use of <b>dust</b> <b>shields,</b> the use of high-grade magnetic separation, and the use of solar flux to sinter and melt the regolith.|$|R
40|$|Stars in galaxies form in giant {{molecular}} {{clouds that}} coalesce when the atomic hydrogen is converted into molecules. There are currently two dominant models for what {{property of the}} galactic disk determines its molecular fraction: either hydrostatic pressure driven by the gravity of gas and stars, {{or a combination of}} gas column density and metallicity. To assess the validity of these models, we compare theoretical predictions to the observed atomic gas content of low-metallicity dwarf galaxies with high stellar densities. The extreme conditions found in these systems are optimal to distinguish the two models, otherwise degenerate in nearby spirals. Locally, on scales < 100 pc, we find that the state of the interstellar medium is mostly sensitive to the gas column density and metallicity rather than hydrostatic pressure. On larger scales where the average stellar density is considerably lower, both pressure and shielding models reproduce the observations, even at low metallicity. We conclude that models based on gas and <b>dust</b> <b>shielding</b> more closely describe the process of molecular formation, especially at the high resolution that can be achieved in modern galaxy simulations or with future radio/millimeter arrays.
