25|$|That {{following}} day, 14 February 1779, Cook {{marched through}} the village to retrieve the King. Cook took the King (aliʻi nui) by his own <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> him willingly away. One of Kalaniʻōpuʻu's favorite wives, Kanekapolei and two chiefs approached the group as they were heading to boats. They pleaded with the king not to go until he stopped and sat where he stood. An old kahuna (priest), chanting rapidly while holding out a coconut, attempted to distract Cook and his men as a large crowd began to form at the shore. The king began to understand that Cook was his enemy. As Cook turned his back to help launch the boats, he was struck on the head by the villagers and then stabbed to death as he fell on {{his face in the}} surf. He was first struck on the head with a club by a chief named Kalaimanokahoʻowaha or Kanaʻina (namesake of Charles Kana'ina) and then stabbed by one of the king's attendants, Nuaa. The Hawaiians carried his body away towards the back of the town, still visible to the ship through their spyglass. Four marines, Corporal James Thomas, Private Theophilus Hinks, Private Thomas Fatchett and Private John Allen, were also killed and two others were wounded in the confrontation.|$|E

60|$|She seized her {{astonished}} father by the <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> him unresisting {{from the}} room.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Jernshaw, {{somewhat}} excited, shook <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> the {{way into}} the little parlour behind the shop.|$|R
60|$|On hearing this, Nootka and {{her mother}} took the girl affectionately by both <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> her away.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come {{and look}} at him!' the {{brothers}} cried, and they each took one of Alice's <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> her up to where the King was sleeping.|$|R
60|$|He {{took her}} <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> her away over the short green turf of the common.|$|E
60|$|She {{then took}} Gerda's <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> {{her into the}} little house and shut the door.|$|E
60|$|King Archidej {{went out}} himself, {{took her by}} the <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> her into the royal apartments.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{want you}} {{to speak to the}} Gardener for us," [...] Sylvie said, as she and Bruno took the old man's <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> him into the hall.|$|R
60|$|He went below with a monkey-wrench, {{unscrewed}} the nut, and let {{the hook}} drop off. When the Greeks had hauled their nets into their boats and made everything shipshape, a posse of citizens took them off our <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> them away to jail.|$|R
60|$|But {{the little}} girls seized his <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> him away to a bench, where, having seated him almost forcibly, each climbed upon a knee. The good Mr. Hemphill sent a furtive glare after Miss Raleigh, who, with that smile of gentle {{gratification}} which comes to one after having just done a good deed to another, sauntered slowly away.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she took}} me by the <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> me to where she had last seen Heliodore.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile {{her father}} had shaken him by the <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> him to an {{armchair}} before the fire.|$|E
60|$|As he {{made that}} answer, Midwinter took his <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> him round the last turn in the path.|$|E
60|$|They each gravely {{took one}} of Barker's <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> him {{to the corner of}} the cabin. There, on an old flour barrel, stood a large tin {{prospecting}} pan, in which the partners also occasionally used to knead their bread. A dirty towel covered it. Demorest whisked it dexterously aside, and disclosed three large fragments of decomposed gold and quartz. Barker started back.|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, Moroz {{together}} {{with several other}} parties prevented President Leonid Kuchma's attempt to concentrate most of the powers in the president's <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> the parliament to adopt on 28 June the new Constitution that includes many positions close {{to the demands of}} left parties. In 1999 after signing the treaty of [...] "Kanev Four" [...] he became an acknowledged leader of the non-Communist opposition to Kuchma.|$|R
60|$|His first action {{seemed to}} crush all the desperate joy which was rising fast in her heart. He took one <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>led</b> {{her to a}} chair.|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's silence, then Harold took Ida's <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> her up {{to where}} her father was standing.|$|E
60|$|Reaching down, he took El-Soo by the <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> {{her across}} the space to where Akoon lay on his back.|$|E
60|$|Eva {{had stood}} silent, listening. Now she took Topsy by the <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> {{her into a}} little room close by.|$|E
60|$|He {{took her}} <b>hand</b> again <b>and</b> <b>led</b> her on. Back they went among the trees, and {{presently}} {{they were on}} a pathway. They walked along with greater safety.|$|R
6000|$|She {{took him}} by the lilywhite <b>hand</b> [...] <b>And</b> <b>led</b> him along the hall [...] Until she {{led him to a}} room [...] Where none could hear him call.|$|R
60|$|And now Rachel took Eliza's <b>hand</b> kindly, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> {{the way to}} the supper-table. As {{they were}} sitting down, a light tap sounded at the door, and Ruth entered.|$|R
60|$|She {{took the}} child's bonnet off {{and flung it}} under the cab, then grasped Tottie's <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> her into a shop.|$|E
60|$|Joan de Tany drew slowly {{away from}} him, and without reply, took his <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> him forward through a dark, cold corridor.|$|E
6000|$|So {{saying the}} lively urchin grasped his new friend by the <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> {{him by a}} rickety {{staircase}} to the [...] "rookeries" [...] above.|$|E
50|$|The catholicus Yohannan, {{after he}} had {{fulfilled}} his office for nearly five years, died in the year 292 904/5. The story goes that he never took a bribe for the laying on of <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> a life of very great poverty. When {{he was about to}} die he said to his disciple, 'Behold, I have 260 zuzae of silver hidden away in such and such a place, which were bequeathed to me by my parents. Take them, and spend them on my funeral.|$|R
5000|$|Late in 50, {{with much}} of the Senate wanting peace and unwilling to act against Caesar, the consul Gaius Marcellus (Minor) took matters into his own <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> a coup, without the backing of the Senate and {{directed}} against Caesar, aiming to put control of an army into the hands of Pompeius. [...] Lentulus, as consul-elect certainly joined with him in this, possibly Gaius Marcellus Major too. [...] Neither the Claudii Marcelli or Lentulus were particular adherents of Pompeius, a powerful magnate and general, but saw him as a tool to use against Caesar.|$|R
60|$|They {{took hold}} of <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> the Horner <b>led</b> them into a dark corner, where he halted.|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{the king}} heard this song he ran out to meet the lute player, took him by the <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> him into the palace.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you;" [...] {{and with}} a final {{pressure}} she loosed his <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> {{the way through the}} long, flagged, bell-hung passage, and pointed to a stair.|$|E
6000|$|... "By all the Prophets! Cornell!" [...] The pocket-miner wrung the man's <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> him forward. [...] "You {{recollect}} Cornell, Corliss? Jake Cornell, Thirty-Seven and a Half Eldorado." ...|$|E
60|$|Sophy, {{struck by}} {{something}} in his voice, swung {{around and looked at}} him. Then she thrust both her arms through his, clasped her two <b>hands</b> together, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> him firmly away. A glimmering of the truth was beginning to dawn upon her.|$|R
60|$|The dumb child gazed {{as if he}} {{read their}} faces, and was begging to remain; he gladly allowed Violet to take his <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> she <b>led</b> him away, {{inviting}} Theodora to come and give her own directions about him to Susan, the girl from Brogden.|$|R
500|$|This {{authorization}} {{from the}} Pope to proceed against Eadberht was delayed until 798, {{but once it}} was received Coenwulf took action. The Mercians captured Eadberht, put out his eyes and cut off his <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>led</b> him in chains to Mercia, where according to later tradition he was imprisoned at Winchcombe, a religious house closely affiliated with Coenwulf's family. By 801 at the latest Coenwulf had placed his brother, Cuthred, on the throne of Kent. Cuthred ruled until {{the time of his}} death in 807, after which Coenwulf took control of Kent in name as well as fact. Coenwulf styled himself [...] "King of the Mercians and the Province of Kent" [...] (rex Merciorum atque provincie Cancie) in a charter dated 809.|$|R
