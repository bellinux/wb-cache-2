40|$|This paper scrutinizes the {{determinants}} of Import Revenue generated in Ghana. An econometric model in Ordinary Least Square is employed on time series data for the period 1997 to 2014. This is aimed at measuring the effect of gross domestic product, effective duty rate, import <b>exemption,</b> import <b>value</b> and relative price on import revenue generated in Ghana. The paper also examines the reforms in import revenue administration, reforms in import revenue generation, effect of automation on import revenue mobilization, the performance of import revenue, sources of import revenue leakages and measures to improve the collection of import revenue. Import revenue is collected by the Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority. The results reveal a strong relationship between GDP, Import <b>Exemption,</b> Import <b>Value</b> and Import Revenue. A moderate relationship exists between Effective Duty Rate and Import Revenue. A negative or weak relationship exists between Relative Price and Import Revenue. Adjusted R 2 > 0. 8 was obtained and this figure is acceptable for the time series data, coefficients {{of the independent variables}} are jointly significant and there is no serial correlation...|$|R

Goods like food, housing, medicine, or infrastructure services (water, telecommunication, postal) are very often partially or totally exempted from VAT. The exemption of infrastructure services had been frequently combined with market entry restrictions. Both instruments should assure the fulfilling of the universal service obligation (USO). VAT-exemption leads to two problems, at least: (i) the expectable financial gain, which can be achieved by the exempted firm, is unpredictable, and (ii) the welfare consequences depend on the prevailing type of market structure (competition, monopoly with or without price discrimination, or dominant firm). The VAT-exemption for German postal services can be seen as an outstanding case study to show the typical consequences. Because of empirical references for intensive use of price discrimination by Deutsche Post AG and strong arguments of Deutsche Post AG as a dominant firm welfare could be increased by abolishing VAT-exemption without abandoning USO. ...|$|R

The paper pursues two main objectives. Firstly, from an explanatory point of view, French fair value choices during the first adoption of the IFRS are presented. The second goal of the article is to reveal the determining factors behind those choices. The Positive Accounting Theory (PAT), of which one of the main objectives is to explain firms' accounting choices, is used as an explanatory background. IFRS choices are linked to the characteristics of the firm such as: size, leverage, CEO's compensation, ownership structure, cross-listing and financial sector. The statistical analysis uses a logistic regression method to attempt to identify systematic differences between firms adopting fair value and others. This study considers the choice of conservatism as an identified criterion for explaining fair value choices. The research query can be summed up thus: How the PAT can explain fair value accounting options made by French companies during the transition to IFRS standards?

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{implications}} of using hedonic regressions of house values {{as the basis for}} property tax assessment in the Republic of Ireland. Ad valorem property taxes are more equitable than flat rate taxes, but their equity benefits can be reduced if the relative values of dwellings are inaccurately assessed. Achieving greater accuracy in assessment tends to increase administrative costs, so policymakers face a trade-off between cost and accuracy. Using the Irish National Survey of Housing Quality of 2002, this study analyses the contribution that information about selected property characteristics can make to determine the relative values of residential properties in Ireland. These characteristics are the location of the dwelling, house size in square meters, the number of rooms and bedrooms in the home, the age {{of the house and the}} type of dwelling. The values of residential properties are estimated using these variables in turn and the prediction errors are presented in terms of the absolute value error and the assessment ratio (the estimated value divided by the market value). We find that it is possible to assign approximately 80 % of houses nationally within the correct tax valuation band using just one of five house characteristics. Households whose house price is under assessed tend to be those with the greatest means (highly skilled professionals and high income earners), so a tax assessment system based on this type of valuation would tend to make regressive errors (while a property tax itself is regressive too). Consequently, checks would need to be put in place in order to more accurately estimate very highly priced properties as well as introducing <b>exemptions</b> for lower <b>value</b> properties and low income groups. The system could also be used to identify likely mis-reporting if using a self-assessment system. hedonic regression/Ireland/property tax...|$|R
40|$|This report {{concerns}} the electric car and charging infrastructure. It {{provides an overview}} of the debates presented in selected Swedish and Norwegian reports, as well as bachelor and master theses. The main purpose is to explore what are the challenges to the adoption of electric cars and charging infrastructure, but also to examine what possibilities exist to promote adoption. Another purpose is to investigate which tools (governmental practices, incentives and planning tools) are emphasized in the creation of sustainable mobility and sustainable cities. Norway is commonly considered {{to be one of the}} leading nations concerning the adoption of electric cars, while Swedish attempts to increase the use of electric cars are sometimes believed to be too moderate. The readings indicate that Norwegian policies have been, and still are, strongly aimed at diffusing the electric car within the Norwegian society by using incentives such as <b>exemptions</b> from <b>Value</b> Added Tax (VAT) and registration tax at the national level, and by allowing access to bus lanes, cheaper ferry fares and exemption from toll road charges at the local level. The main purpose behind this effort is to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, but perhaps more importantly to spur the development of industries in connection to electric vehicles (EVs).   Sweden, as compared to Norway, has taken a somewhat different approach. There is no national, coherent plan for the diffusion of the electric car. Instead Sweden is to a high degree relying on municipal planning to try out various technical and management measures, with the aim to create sustainable cities. The Swedish conservative government has also been criticized by the Swedish National Audit Office (Riksrevisionen) among others for being too vague when it comes to the governing of infrastructure and transport in relation to environmental agreements and objectives. Despite these differences between Sweden and Norway, the readings show a high degree of consistency regarding challenges and opportunities in the nexus of adoption of electric cars-sustainable development: Limited range, lack of trust and inadequate knowledge are still considered to be major obstacles to the adoption of electric cars. Innovation and improvements of batteries are among the “hard” measures to ensure diffusion and adoption, while municipal and state mobility management, also including effective policies and incentives, are held to be among the most important “soft” tools for fostering sustainable mobility. Apart from providing the abovementioned overview, this report also offers a theoretical discussion in order to contextualize the electric car and charging infrastructure. The discussion stretches from diffusion of innovation theory, to urban governmental and planning practices onto the importance of mobility and/or accessibility for social justice and inclusion.

40|$|As more Americans consume {{fast food}} each year, more Americans are {{contracting}} serious diseases related to obesity. Considering that obesity ranks second behind tobacco use {{as the largest}} contributor to mortality rates in the United States, and also that it gives rise to greater publicly funded health care expenses than does tobacco, this phenomenon begs the obvious question: To what extent does the growing consumption of fast food contribute to the obesity epidemic and the incidence of disease? If the answer indicates a meaningful contribution, a natural follow-up question then emerges: In a sensible legal system, what instruments would best ameliorate its effects? In attempting to answer these questions, this Article explores obesity as an economic occurrence, and how varying legal remedies may curtail its deleterious effects on the American economy. In doing so, this Article surveys the proportional causes of obesity, and it identifies fast food consumption as an essential element. In accordance with that finding, this Article ponders whether an absence of nutritional labeling has precipitated overconsumption, and how the law may be optimally utilized to minimize associated inefficiencies. Specifically, Part I appraises the primary determinants of obesity in the United States, as well as whether Americans knowingly contribute to their corpulence. This is an essential examination, since obesity has morphed into a material public expense, with taxpayers now bearing {{approximately half of the}} cost of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s girth. Through this analysis, Part I confirms the predictable: Most Americans already know that fast food consumption may impair their health. Yet, more engagingly, it also reveals that Americans often underestimate the extent of that impairment, in part because they tend to discount the negative contents of restaurant food. Accordingly, many Americans internalize a degree of risk less significant than the actual risk present, thus rendering their food decision-making process systematically optimistic. This is particularly evident among children, who prove uniquely sanguine. Part II then scrutinizes federal governmental choices when imposing food labeling requirements, as well as the extent of regulatory authority that has been delegated to the Food 2 ̆ 6 Drug Administration (FDA). Significantly, the federal government has exempted all restaurants from food labeling requirements. The merits of such a privilege bear query, since any exemption from product labeling presumes that consumers engage in a rational assessment of associated risks. As explored in Part III, however, other relevant actors, such as the State of New York, have concluded otherwise, specifically that consumers often fail to engage in such rational assessment. While adhering to the confines of the federal labeling exemption, these actors have consummated voluntary agreements with fast food companies in hopes of efficiently engineering market incentives for nutritional disclosure. Similarly, certain industry participants, by offering healthy dishes, may implicitly signal the less nourishing content of their regular dishes. Thus, in order to fully evaluate the efficacy of the labeling <b>exemption,</b> the supplemental <b>value</b> of these existing and voluntary market influences must also be considered. Part IV turns to the emerging, though largely quixotic, judicial remedies for Americans who have contracted obesity-related diseases, allegedly due to fast food consumption. Though such lawsuits have been dismissed as trivial by most commentators, they present an excellent vehicle for examining the comparative merits of prospective regulation and retrospective litigation. That is, they suggest something of a recurring miss: A discrete group of individuals appears uniquely inclined to overconsume fast food, thus intimating a traditional common law duty on the part of fast food companies to warn; yet, for purposes of establishing legal causation, identifying and quantifying the proportional causes for any one person 2 ̆ 7 s obesity and obesity-related disease proves exceedingly difficult, if not impossible. Thus, such lawsuits continuously fail to satisfy the requisite contours of a tort claim, even though they raise meritorious concerns for social scientists and policy makers alike. By applying consumer choice theory to fast food consumption, Part V proposes a new theoretical framework that could both conceive a limited common law duty to warn of the dangers of overconsumption and, by immunizing a food seller from tort liability, reward compliance with such a duty. Specifically, this Article postulates revision of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA) to require the divulgence of nutritional information for all fast food items marketed for childhood consumption. In this narrowly tailored setting, the food decision-making process appears both uniquely optimistic and capable of correction, as parents often dictate or significantly influence the food consumption of their children. In that particular decision-making process, parents internalize an anomalously high value in nutrition and diminished tolerance of risk. Moreover, the imposition of a targeted nutritional labeling requirement would prove strikingly less onerous than more regressive and costly measures, such as an obesity tax or a fast food tax. In short, this form of nutritional labeling would prove uniquely efficacious. Accordingly, regulatory and judicial alternatives may be combined to most efficiently curtail the effects of fast food overconsumption on public health and tax-funded expenditures, while simultaneously removing from the American tort system a legally implausible, though factually credible, claim...|$|R
40|$|Contracts of sale, lease, loan, labour, {{assignment}} {{and other types}} of contracts are the tools whereby different transactions are effected whether between individuals inter se or among groups of natural or juristic persons. The contents of contracts do not rank equally in regard to their legal <b>value.</b> <b>Exemption</b> and limitation terms are of the most important categories because they delimit the boundaries of the contract. Whereas exemption terms enable a party to a contract to exclude a liability which will otherwise be his, limitation terms limit the liability of a party either by placing a ceiling for compensation, or by specifying a time limit for bringing an action. They are invariably used in standard form contracts particularly in the type known as contracts of adhesion. Now, the device of the standard form is a prevalent phenomenon of the modern society. It is used in transactions usually associated with the needs of the daily life such as electricity, water, communication [...] . etc. The providers of these services have usually a monopoly on them. Such monopoly is apt to create inequality of bargaining powers and to put consumers in a weaker position. The law is to step in to restore the contractual equilibrium and to protect consumers. This is achieved by controlling the use of exemption and limitation terms in contracts via statutory or judicial arrangements. The legal intervention, whether statutory or judicial, is backed by economic and social dimensions. As far as the economic and social factors are variable, the need for studying exemption and limitation terms is continually renewed not only in comparative systems, but also within the same legal system. The vital importance of exemption and limitation terms at the legal as well as the economic and social levels always triggers studies. This explains why much ink is spilled in studying exemption and limitation clauses in most jurisdictions. However, there is paucity of literature in Sudan particularly at the academic level. The only available elaborate VI study was made by the late Dr. Zaki Mustafa in 1967. Thence, to study this virgin area of Sudan law is to assume a burden at once challenging and pioneering. The fact that there is paucity of local literature elevates the need for studying exemption and limitation clauses in comparative jurisdictions. A comparative handling has a twofold value: As a reference for explaining local legal rules and as a pointer toward questions yet unsolved in Sudan. It is a common goal of all legal systems to guarantee the freedom of the parties to agree on their own terms on one hand, and to guard against abusive use of contract terms on the other. The mechanism for striking a balance between these two conflicting demands differs from one system to another. It is either legislative or judicial. The degree of the legal interference is inversely proportionate to the freedom of the parties i. e. less interference means more freedom and vice versa. The problem intended to be tackled in this thesis is created by the fact that Sudan courts used to follow English law {{from the beginning of the}} Condominium Period in 1898 up to 1974. The Contracts Act 1974, due to some local factors, had deviated considerably from the pre-existing position which was based on English law. The relative ''illiteracy'' and considerations of business ''unawareness'' were the main factors which prompted the Sudanese legislature to approach the question of exemption and limitation clauses in a different way. The rationale of that approach might have been selfevident at the time the Contracts Act 1974 coming into force. However, the same provisions of the Contracts Act 1974 dealing with exemption and limitation clauses have been reenacted and adopted almost verbatim in the present Civil Transactions Act 1984. Now, more than three decades have elapsed since 1974. The question: What provisions currently govern exemption and limitation terms under Sudan law? How had Sudan courts applied them? How to deal with matters of relatively modern nature such as "standardization" of exemption and limitation clauses and ''prevention of unfair contract terms'' in ''consumer contracts'' or in other types of contracts? How to make use of comparative jurisprudence as a reference for explaining local legal rules and as a pointer VII toward questions yet unsolved in Sudan? Is there a need for reform? These questions sum-up the exact problem posed in this thesis, and the answers thereof constitute its main theme. The methodology followed in this thesis is one of exposition, comparison, analysis and conclusion. The present statement of the law as represented by the Civil Transactions Act 1984 is reviewed, analyzed and then compared: Vertically with English law and American law, and horizontally with the position of Sudan law before 1974 and the period 1974 - 1984. This creates for grounds for comparison. Notably, the English system has been specifically chosen in this thesis because it is one of the important historical sources of Sudan law. It was applied for more than half a century. The American system, on the other hand, is chosen for its closer similarities to the Sudanese system, especially in regard to the method of preventing the use of abusive exemption and limitation clauses. Both systems avail the courts with wide discretionary powers to police the use of abusive clauses. The thesis consists of five chapters as follows: Chapter I: An introductory chapter consisting of three issues: The first tackles the terminology of exemption and limitation clauses, the second defines them and the third deals with their types and the grounds of their classification. Chapter II: Discusses the position of Sudan law toward exemption and limitation clauses in two issues: The first reviews the historical evolution of Sudan law and the second analyzes the relevant provisions of the repealed Contracts Act 1974 and the Civil Transactions Act 1984. Chapter III: Revises the experience of comparative systems with special reference to the English and the American systems. The reason for choosing each of these two systems is highlighted as a first issue. The second issue studies English law with reference to certain heads and the third deals with American law specifically the doctrine of contractual conscionability. VIII Chapter IV: Deals with three issues related to exemption and limitation clauses. The first is the rules of interpretation of exemption and limitation clauses and the application of such rules, the second is the phenomenon of standard form contracts and contracts of adhesion under local and comparative jurisprudence and the third is the effect of a fundamental breach on the applicability of an exemption or a limitation clause in the same contract. Chapter V: A closing chapter to sum-up the results to which this study has reached coupled with the specific recommendations. The chapter is appended with two schedules: The first comprises three lists of judicial precedents which are discussed or referred to from the Sudanese, English and American systems. The second comprises a list of references, text books and articles quoted or referred to in this thesis...|$|R
