40|$|We tend to {{interact}} with same people, day after day. Might this affect our behavior? In an abstract fashion, {{we look at this}} question. To model this repeated interaction with a small subset of the entire population we place agents on the nodes of a network and have them play a prisoners’ dilemma game exclusively with their neighbors. We then alter the payoffs of the game and the topology of the network to see if, when, and to what degree cooperation survives. We find widely <b>divergent</b> <b>aggregate</b> decisions across networks and across payoffs. But, there is commonality as well. It seems clear that some networks, or some organizational structures, are more conducive to fostering cooperationPD games, networks...|$|E

This approach {{has been used by}} a range of authors to explore insights to macroscale energy systems and linkages with economic growth. However, these analyses use a variety of calculation methods with sometimes coarse assumptions, inhibiting comparisons. Therefore, building on previous studies, this paper first contributes toward a common useful work accounting framework, by developing more refined methodological techniques for electricity end use and transport exergy efficiencies. Second, to test this more consistent and granular approach, these advances are applied to the US and UK for 1960 to 2010. The results reveal <b>divergent</b> <b>aggregate</b> exergy efficiencies: US efficiency remains stable at around 11 %, while UK efficiency rises from 9 % to 15 %. The US efficiency stagnation is due to “efficiency dilution”, where structural shifts to lower efficiency consumption (e. g., air-conditioning) outweigh device-level efficiency gains. The results demonstrate this is an important area of research, with consequent implications for national energy efficiency policies...|$|E

It is triclinic; as colorless, bladed to {{prismatic}} crystals up to 4 mm in length, often as <b>divergent,</b> radial <b>aggregates</b> and as pseudomorphs after triphlyte crystals; occurs in the Barker pegmatite (formerly Ferguson pegmatite), east of Keystone, South Dakota, and in the Palermo pegmatite, North Groton, New Hampshire.|$|R

40|$|Meyerhofferite is a calcium {{hydrated}} borate mineral with ideal formula: CaB 3 O 3 (OH) 5 _H 2 O and {{occurs as}} white complex acicular to crude crystals with length up to _ 4 cm, in fibrous <b>divergent,</b> radiating <b>aggregates</b> or reticulated {{and is often}} found in sedimentary or lake-bed borate deposits. The Raman spectrum of meyerhofferite is dominated by intense sharp band at 880 cm_ 1 assigned to the symmetric stretching mode of trigonal boron. Broad Raman bands at 1046, 1110, 1135 and 1201 cm_ 1 are attributed to BOH in-plane bending modes. Raman bands in the 900 – 1000 cm_ 1 spectral region are assigned to the antisymmetric stretching of tetrahedral boron. Distinct OH stretching Raman bands are observed at 3400, 3483 and 3608 cm_ 1. The mineral meyerhofferite has a distinct Raman spectrum which {{is different from the}} spectrum of other borate minerals, making Raman spectroscopy a very useful tool for the detection of meyerhofferite in sedimentary and lake bed deposits...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} the inter- relationship between economic growth, saving rate and inflation for south-east and south Asia in a simultaneous equation framework using two stage least squares with panel data. The relationship between saving rate and {{growth has been}} found to be bi-directional and positive. Inflation has a highly significant negative effect on growth but positive effect on saving rate. Inflation is not affected by growth but is largely determined by its past values, and saving rate is not affected by interest rate. These findings for countries in Asia with widely <b>divergent</b> values of <b>aggregates</b> are very relevant for development policies and strategies. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} to <b>aggregate</b> <b>divergent</b> health impacts associated with {{different types of}} environmental exposures, such as air pollution, residential noise, and large technologic risks. From the policy maker's point of view, {{there are at least}} three good reasons for this type of aggregation: comparative risk evaluation (for example, setting priorities), evaluation of the efficiency of environmental policies in terms of health gain, and characterizing health risk associated with geographical accumulation of multiple environmental exposures. The proposed impact measure integrates three important dimensions of public health: life expectancy, quality of life, and number of people affected. Time is the unit of measurement. "Healthy life years " are either lost by premature death or by loss of quality of life, measured as discounted life years within a population. Severity weights (0 for perfect health, 1 for death) are assigned to discount the time spen...|$|R
