25|$|Following his announcement, Rasmussen Reports had Barr polling at 6% {{nationwide}} against Barack Obama (42%), John McCain (38%), and Ralph Nader (4%). The study identified Barr as the Libertarian candidate, {{but most}} voters {{said they did}} not know enough about him to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>opinion</b> of him personally. Barr's support in the poll was a net drain on Republicans; he picked up 7% of the Republican vote, 5% of the Democratic vote, and 5% of the unaffiliated vote.|$|E
25|$|In the 2010 Australian election, Mark Latham urged Australians to vote informally by handing in blank ballot {{papers for}} the 2010 election. He {{also stated that}} he doesn't feel it is fair for the {{government}} to force citizens to vote if they don't <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>opinion</b> or threaten them into voting with a fine. An Australian Electoral Commission spokesman stated that the Commonwealth Electoral Act did not contain an explicit provision prohibiting the casting of a blank vote. How the Australian Electoral Commission arrived at this opinion is unknown; it runs contrary to the opinions of Chief Justice Sir Garfield Barwick, who wrote that voters must actually mark the ballot paper and deposit that ballot into a ballot box, and Justice Blackburn who was of the opinion that casting an invalid vote was a violation of the Act.|$|E

[...] LaBeouf later regretted his comments and their effect on his relationship with Spielberg: [...] "He told me there's a time to be a human being and <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>opinion,</b> and there's a time to sell cars. It brought me freedom, but it also killed my spirits because this was a dude I looked up to like a sensei." ...|$|E

500|$|Constantine began co-hosting What Not to Wear with Trinny Woodall in 2001, which {{required}} using her fashion advice and expertise {{in order to}} reform participants' appearances and fashion style. Constantine and Woodall hosted What Not to Wear until 2005 and became renowned for their tactile behaviour with the participants, direct advice, and frequently referring to breasts as tits which {{has become something of}} a trademark. Never one to hold back, a notorious moment arose when Constantine spontaneously pulled a female candidate's underwear down during filming as her knicker line was visible. Critics of What Not to Wear argued that the duo were too patronising to their subjects, a claim which they strongly disagree with. Constantine insists that their subjects [...] "see we have a genuine love of women. We love women and they can see that. Women just know." [...] She also stated [...] "Ultimately, what we're doing is giving people confidence. We're probably the only people who <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>opinion,</b> who care how ordinary people dress. No one at Vogue magazine gives a shit. They work with the designers, it's more creative and artistic – they are creating something beautiful. But they don't care about how their readers end up looking – whereas we do!" [...] The show made Constantine and Woodall household names and they are now known together as Trinny and Susannah. One reporter has simply referred to Constantine as [...] "the one with 'big tits'." [...] Constantine and Woodall have even considered taking insurance out on their partnership should something unforeseen happen, although Constantine was against the move.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics on Riot Act {{were more}} direct than on {{preceding}} records, {{in response to}} the political climate after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Bassist Jeff Ament commented that he felt that love was a major theme of the album, and Vedder tried to convey themes such as love, loss and struggle to make a difference because of the difficulty in leading with events such as the September 11 attacks and the accidental death of nine fans during Pearl Jam's performance at the 2000 Roskilde Festival – [...] "You start feeling like, 'What do I have to say? What is my opinion?' Then I realized I did <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>opinion.</b> Not only did I have one, but I felt like it was formed by processing a lot of information and having good influences. Ament also told that [...] "I think the time's right to turn our voice up a bit [...] And Ed did it in a great way, with humour and a mystical, magical approach. It isn't just, 'We're pissed off, and fuck you! Riot! Anarchy!' Cos I don't think that's the method. At least at this point." [...] Vedder, however, said, [...] "I have to admit this record came out a bit one-sided. But I think we as a country need to understand why we're involved in the Middle East. This hollow patriotism frightens me." [...] The singer added that the Riot Act lyrics [...] "represent my state of mind these days. I'm optimistic yet disillusioned, hopeful yet frustrated." [...] Several songs on the album were inspired by Roskilde tragedy, with the album's first single, [...] "I Am Mine", being written by Vedder in 2000 in a hotel room before the band's first show after Roskilde, and [...] "Love Boat Captain" [...] including a brief lyrical reference ("Lost nine friends we'll never know... two years ago today"). Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, [...] "There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed." ...|$|E

According to a November 2010 CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll, 72% of adult Americans favored permitting people who are openly gay or lesbian {{to serve in the}} military, while 23% opposed it.

[...] "The two polls report virtually the same number who say they oppose gays serving openly in the military, which suggests that {{there are some people who}} favor that change in policy but for some reason were reluctant to admit that to the Pew interviewers. That happens occasionally on topics where moral issues and equal-treatment issues intersect." ...|$|E
