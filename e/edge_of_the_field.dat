5|$|MFP Baseball, which {{purchased}} the Sounds in early 2009, invested over $2million to make repairs and upgrades to the aging stadium's playing field, restrooms, concession stands, scoreboard, sound system, and seating. The infield was re-sodded and leveled, protective railing was installed along the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> and the backstop netting was replaced. The entire concourse and guitar scoreboard were repainted, broken seats were replaced, and Sluggers Sports Bar & Grill was remodeled. A permanent concert stage {{and a family}} fun zone were constructed by the concourse entrance.|$|E
5|$|Bodyline was {{a tactic}} devised for and {{primarily}} {{used in the}} Ashes series between England and Australia in 1932—33. The tactic involved bowling at leg stump or just outside it, pitching the ball short so that it reared at {{the body of a}} batsman stood in an orthodox batting position. A ring of fielders ranged on the leg side would catch any defensive deflections from the bat. The batsman's options were to evade the ball through ducking or moving aside, allow the ball to strike their body or play the ball with his bat. The latter course carried additional risks. Defensive shots brought few runs and could carry far enough to be caught by the fielders on the leg side; pull and hook shots could be caught on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> where two men were usually placed for such a shot.|$|E
25|$|The bordure is {{a border}} {{touching}} the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{locations}} for parameter tables, when such tables are used, are floating near <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drawing, either near the title block or elsewhere along <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b>|$|R
25|$|When two eagles {{are shown}} {{back-to-back}} and facing <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>the</b> term used is addorsed / endorsed or adossés ("back-to-back").|$|R

25|$|The 'sliding defence' {{requires}} that gaps are left at either <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> {{at the end}} of the defensive line, which aims to squeeze more players around the area of play. This allows the line to be at its strongest around the position of play, thus leaving the attacking side less opportunity to run through the line. Should the attacking side move the ball towards one <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> in an attempt to go around the defensive line, then the entire defensive line will move in that direction; this is known as sliding.|$|E
25|$|Law 19: Boundaries. A {{boundary}} {{is marked}} around the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> of play. If {{the ball is}} hit into or past this boundary, four runs are scored, or six runs if the ball doesn't hit the ground before crossing the boundary.|$|E

25|$|The {{boundary}} is {{the edge}} of the playing field, or the physical object marking the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> such as a rope or fence. In low-level matches, a series of plastic cones are often used. Since the early 2000s the boundaries at professional matches are often a series of padded cushions carrying sponsors' logos strung along a rope. If it is moved during play (such as by a fielder sliding into the rope) the boundary is considered to remain at the point where that object first stood.|$|E
25|$|A farm {{originally}} called Chapelton Moss Head by Thomson in 1828 or Mosshead of Chapelton, {{is later}} called just Mosshead and was {{situated in the}} fields of Bottoms Farm with its entrance just after the bridge over the Chapel Burn. All traces of it above ground have vanished, while Bogside cottage is still represented by building debris at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> near the entrance to the Bogflat Farm. Bogside had a rental value of £10 in 1820 and the proprietor was Robert Stevenson. Bottoms point Crevoch farm still exists close to Kennox (2009).|$|E
25|$|The 'umbrella defence' (or 'up and in' defence) {{requires}} that players do not {{spread across the}} entire field. The defensive line is particularly vulnerable on the edges around the wings, therefore the best defensive measure {{in this case is}} a preventative measure. That is, the aim becomes to prevent the attacking team from going to the wings or to disrupt any passes towards the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> This {{requires that}} defensive players (wingers or centres) {{on the edge of the}} defensive line move up faster than those in the middle of the line.|$|E

Light fall-off at <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> has also been reduced from the Sironar-N lenses.|$|R
50|$|Strategy {{involves}} blocking an opponent's potential moves, outmaneuvering {{the opponent}} at <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> and setting traps for penalty kicks in range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opponent's goal. If a trap is not executed successfully, the opponent {{may be able}} to reverse it in an extreme move.|$|R
5000|$|A {{bar that}} has been [...] "couped" [...] (cut) at the ends {{so as not to}} reach <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> is called a hamade, hamaide or hummet, after <b>the</b> town <b>of</b> La Hamaide in Hainaut, Belgium. As a charge, it is almost always {{depicted}} in threes. The adjective is hummety.|$|R
25|$|The oldest {{geological}} {{charge is}} the mount, typically a green hilltop {{rising from the}} lower <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> providing a place for a beast, building or tree to stand. This feature is exceedingly common in Hungarian arms. Natural mountains and boulders are not unknown, though ranges of mountains are differently shown. An example is the arms of Edinburgh, portraying Edinburgh Castle atop Castle Rock. Volcanos are shown, almost without exception, as erupting, and the eruption is generally quite stylised. In the 18th century, landscapes {{began to appear in}} armory, often depicting the sites of battles. For example, Admiral Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson received a chief of augmentation containing a landscape alluding to the Battle of the Nile.|$|E
25|$|Jayawardene's One Day International debut {{was against}} Zimbabwe at Premadasa in January 1998. Sri Lanka won the match, with Jayawardene hitting the winning run. In {{the next game}} Jayawardene scored 74. It took only 11 matches before he scored his first century, which was against England in the Carlton and United World Series game at Adelaide. Jayawardene entered a {{pressure}} situation, with Sri Lanka struggling at 134/4 in the run chase, but made an innings of 120 runs to win the match. The match is notable for Ross Emerson's no-balling of Muttiah Muralitharan for throwing, which led the Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga to lead his team to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> and consider {{walking out of the}} match, as well as physical shoulder-barging by some players.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} the mobile steam engine allowed steam power {{to be applied to}} {{ploughing}} from about 1850. In Europe, soil conditions were often too soft to support the weight of heavy traction engines. Instead, counterbalanced, wheeled ploughs, known as balance ploughs, were drawn by cables across the fields by pairs of ploughing engines on opposite field edges, or by a single engine drawing directly towards it at one end and drawing away from it via a pulley at the other end. The balance plough had two sets of ploughs facing each other, arranged so when one was in the ground, the other set was lifted into the air. When pulled in one direction, the trailing ploughs were lowered onto the ground by the tension on the cable. When the plough reached the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> the other engine pulled the opposite cable, and the plough tilted (balanced), putting the other set of shares into the ground, and the plough worked back across the field.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "Saint George's cross" [...] was {{at first}} {{associated}} with any plain Greek cross touching <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> (not necessarily red on white). Thomas Fuller in 1647 spoke of [...] "the plain or St George's cross" [...] as [...] "the mother <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> others" [...] (that is, the other heraldic crosses).|$|R
50|$|Animals such as {{rats and}} mice display a natural aversion to brightly lit areas. They also have a drive to explore a {{perceived}} threatening stimulus. <b>The</b> result <b>of</b> these two conflicting drives is anxiety. Decreased anxiety leads to increased exploratory behaviour. Increased anxiety will result in less locomotor motion and preference for <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b>|$|R
500|$|From his {{vantage point}} William Hulton {{perceived}} the unfolding events as {{an assault on}} the yeomanry, and on L'Estrange's arrival at 1:50pm, at the head of his hussars, he ordered them into the field to disperse the crowd with the words: [...] "Good God, Sir, don't you see they are attacking the Yeomanry; disperse the meeting!" [...] The 15th Hussars formed themselves into a line stretching across the eastern end of St Peter's Field, and charged into the crowd. At about the same time the Cheshire Yeomanry charged from the southern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> At first the crowd had some difficulty in dispersing, as the main exit route into Peter Street was blocked by the 88th Regiment of Foot, standing with bayonets fixed. One officer of the 15th Hussars was heard trying to restrain the by now out of control Manchester and Salford Yeomanry, who were [...] "cutting at every one they could reach": [...] "For shame! For shame! Gentlemen: forbear, forbear! The people cannot get away!" ...|$|E
500|$|Australia won the toss. The match {{began in}} damp conditions, {{and before the}} pitch began to dry, at which point it would become {{extremely}} difficult for batting, the Australian opening batsmen scored 135 in 90 minutes; Australia's total reached 173 for one wicket at lunch, and Victor Trumper scored a century in that time. MacLaren was subsequently criticised for allowing Australia to score so quickly, but claimed that his carefully planned strategy was rendered obsolete when Trumper began to strike {{the ball out of}} the ground. MacLaren commented: [...] "I couldn't very well have had a man fielding in the bloody practice ground, now could I?" [...] The bowlers recovered the situation to some extent, and following a century from Jackson, England trailed by 37 runs after the first innings. In the second innings, Australia collapsed to the England bowlers, but Tate dropped a crucial catch while stationed by MacLaren at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> MacLaren also received criticism for this, as Tate was unaccustomed to fielding on the boundary. Gibson notes that MacLaren [...] "later spent much breath defending himself on this point"; although {{it is not clear how}} Tate came to be moved—a later interpretation is that MacLaren moved Tate there rather than ask an amateur player to cross the field for a few deliveries—most commentators agree that this was the turning point of the match. England were left needing 124 runs to win. MacLaren opened the batting, having batted at number four in the first innings, and tried to score quickly, but was caught from a big hit. According to Gibson, he returned to the dressing room in fury, throwing his bat across the room and saying that he had [...] "thrown away the match and the bloody rubber [...] ". Gibson suggests that the implication that only MacLaren could have guided England to victory must have had a demoralising effect on the remaining batsmen, and speculates that he felt guilty over the composition of a team that looked likely to lose. Gibson comments: [...] "This does not say much for MacLaren as a captain. Indeed, it has always seemed to me a shocking performance, from the choice of the team to the chuck of the bat." [...] Wickets continued to fall and Tate, the last batsman, was bowled when England needed four runs to win.|$|E

2500|$|Flying {{conditions}} at Hoover Field were notoriously poor. Arlington Beach, a local amusement park, was {{located on the}} north-northeastern edge of the airport (next to Highway Bridge), and a landfill on the north-northwestern side. The trash in the landfill was also on fire. The smoke sometimes obscured the landing field, and the stench was notorious through the city of Washington. The United States Department of Agriculture owned the [...] Arlington Experimental Farm immediately adjacent to the northwestern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> A public swimming pool was located at the airport, and local children often crossed the runway to get to it.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the battle}} between the Last Alliance and Sauron's forces that begins the film, an {{elaborate}} CGI animation system, called MASSIVE, was developed by Stephen Regelous; it allowed thousands of individual animated [...] "characters" [...] in the program to act independently. This helped give the illusion of realism to the battle sequences. The [...] "Making of" [...] Lord of the Rings DVD reports some interesting initial problems: in the first execution of a battle between groups of characters, the wrong groups attacked each other. In another early demo, some of the warriors at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> could be seen running away. They were initially moving in the wrong direction, and had been programmed to keep running until they encountered an enemy.|$|E
