5|$|Attachments between {{infants and}} {{caregivers}} form {{even if this}} caregiver is not sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them. This has important implications. Infants cannot exit unpredictable or insensitive caregiving relationships. Instead they must manage themselves {{as best they can}} within such relationships. Based on her established Strange Situation Protocol, research by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth in the 1960s and 1970s found that children will have different patterns of attachment depending primarily on how they experienced their early caregiving environment. Early patterns of attachment, in turn, shape — but <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>determine</b> — the individual's expectations in later relationships.|$|E

California, the state with the largest Academic Decathlon, holds local scrimmages using the Round 1 tests, which are largely for practice and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>determine</b> whether a team can compete at the regional level, which uses Round 2 tests. In the 2008–09 season, 43 states participated in statewide Academic Decathlons, though only 35 and an international school participated in the national competition.|$|E

25|$|Some coffee states, like Costa Rica and Colombia, {{passed laws}} like the Homestead Act of 1862. They favored smallholders, held elections, {{maintained}} small militaries, and fought fewer wars. Smallholder arrangements prompted widespread government investment in education. Other states like El Salvador and Guatemala produced coffee on plantations, where individuals were more disenfranchised. Whether a state became a smallholder or plantation state depended not on factor endowments but on norms established under colonialism—namely, legal statues determining access to land, {{the background of}} the governing elites, and the degree of permitted political competition. Nugent and Robinson thereby conclude that factor endowments alone <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>determine</b> economic or political institutions.|$|E
500|$|This {{objection}} {{seems to}} rest on a misunderstanding of Kant's views since Kant argued that morality is dependent upon {{the concept of a}} rational will (and the related concept of a categorical imperative: an imperative which any rational being must necessarily will for itself). [...] It is not based on contingent features of any being's will, nor upon human wills in particular, so there is no sense in which Kant makes ethics [...] "dependent" [...] upon anything which has not always existed. [...] Furthermore, the sense in which our wills are subject to the law is precisely that if our wills are rational, we must will in a lawlike fashion; that is, we must will according to moral judgments we apply to all rational beings, including ourselves. This is more easily understood by parsing the term [...] "autonomy" [...] into its Greek roots: auto (self) + nomos (rule or law). That is, an autonomous will, according to Kant, is not merely one which follows its own will, but whose will is lawful-that is, conforming to the principle of universalizability, which Kant also identifies with reason. Ironically, in another passage, willing according to immutable reason is precisely the kind of capacity Elshtain ascribes to God as the basis of his moral authority, and she commands this over an inferior voluntarist version of divine command theory, which would make both morality and God's will contingent. Kant's theory is a version of the first rather than the second view of autonomy, so neither God nor any human authority, including contingent human institutions, play any unique authoritative role in his moral theory. Kant and Elshtain, that is, both agree God {{has no choice but to}} conform his will to the immutable facts of reason, including moral truths; humans do have such a choice, but otherwise their relationship to morality is the same as that of God's: they can recognize moral facts, but <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>determine</b> their content through contingent acts of will.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{point of}} {{disagreement}} concerns {{the uniqueness of}} evidential probability, relative to a given state of knowledge. [...] Rudolf Carnap held, for example, that logical principles always determine a unique logical probability for any statement, relative to any body of evidence. [...] Ramsey, by contrast, thought that while degrees of belief are subject to some rational constraints (such as, but not limited to, the axioms of probability) these constraints usually <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>determine</b> a unique value. [...] Rational people, in other words, may differ somewhat in their degrees of belief, even if they {{all have the same}} information.|$|E
2500|$|This {{debate has}} {{generally}} settled {{on whether or}} not the gap is too wide. If too wide, civilian control of the military may be jeopardized due to serious misunderstandings between the two worlds. While most agree that such a gap is to be expected and, in and of itself, is not dangerous, some do concede the aspects of that gap have led directly to misunderstandings between the two worlds. In particular, some have argued that the culture of political conservatism and the apparent increase in partisanship of the officer corps has approached a dangerous limit. Nearly all agree that it is possible for the cultural gap to be either too wide or too narrow, but there is wide disagreement as to where the current situation rests on that continuum. While Elizabeth Kier argues that [...] "structure and function <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>determine</b> culture," [...] most agree that a difference between the two is necessary because civilian culture was [...] "incommensurate with military effectiveness." ...|$|E

2500|$|In most {{international}} {{versions of}} the game show Duel, if two contestants do not cover the correct answer to a regular question when the duel is in process, the duel goes to a sudden death question called a [...] "Shootout". For this sudden death question, the contestants who are participating get 4 new chips each, {{and there are no}} accelerators or presses available. If only one contestant answers correctly, the contestant who has the answer wins. If both contestants get the answer correct, the contestant who covered fewer choices wins, but if both contestants do not cover the correct answer to the shootout question, they are both eliminated (that happens automatically if both contestants are wrong during the duel in international versions that do not have sudden death). In a situation in which both contestants covered the same number of choices during sudden death, both contestants win the duel, and one of the contestants, picked at random, must leave the show. [...] In some instances, if a winner cannot be determined on the question (regardless if both contestants tie or would be eliminated), multiple Shootouts may occur until a winner is determined. [...] In that case, the tie-breakers that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>determine</b> a winner may be edited out of the final broadcast.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} {{instances}} of radicals which play a phonetic {{and not a}} semantic role in characters, such as 臼 [...] jiù [...] "a mortar" [...] in 舅 jiù [...] "maternal uncle" [...] (Shuowen lists this under its semantic component 男 nán, [...] "male", but the 200-odd radicals used in modern dictionaries do not include all the semantic components that are used) and 舊 jiù [...] "owl; old" [...] (listed in the Far East on p.1141 under the header 臼); 虎 hǔ [...] "tiger" [...] in 虖 hū [...] "shout"; 鬼 guǐ (originally [...] "helmet"), now [...] "ghost", [...] in 魁 kúi, [...] "leader"; 鹿 lù [...] "deer" [...] in 麓 lù, foothills; 麻 má [...] "hemp" [...] in 麼 ma, mó [...] "tiny"; 黃 huáng [...] "yellow" [...] in 黌 hóng [...] "a school"; 羽 yǔ [...] "feather" [...] in 翌 yì [...] "next"; 齊 qí in 齎 jī [...] "to present"; 青 qīng in 靖 jìng [...] "peaceful", 靚 jìng [...] "to ornament; quiet"; and 靜 jìng [...] "quiet", and so on. In some cases, arbitrarily chosen radicals coincidentally play a semantic role in the characters listed under them. In general, phonetic components <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>determine</b> the exact pronunciation of a character, but only give a clue to a its pronunciation.

60|$|Our {{spontaneous}} {{action is}} always the best. You cannot with your best deliberation and heed come so close to any question as your spontaneous glance shall bring you, whilst you rise from your bed, or walk abroad in the morning after meditating the matter before sleep on the previous night. Our thinking is a pious reception. Our truth of thought is therefore vitiated as much by too violent direction given by our will, as by too great negligence. We <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>determine</b> what we will think. We only open our senses, clear away as we can all obstruction from the fact, and suffer the intellect to see. We have little control over our thoughts. We are the prisoners of ideas. They catch us up for moments into their heaven and so fully engage us that we take no thought for the morrow, gaze like children, without {{an effort to make}} them our own. By and by we fall out of that rapture, bethink us where we have been, what we have seen, and repeat as truly as we can what we have beheld.

But the moment we cease to report and attempt to correct and contrive, it is not truth.|$|E
60|$|It was a merciful {{disposition}} of Providence also, and which I have many times thought of at that time, that no fires, or no considerable ones at least, {{happened in the}} city during that year, which, {{if it had been}} otherwise, would have been very dreadful; and either the people must have let them alone unquenched, or have come together in great crowds and throngs, unconcerned at the danger of the infection, not concerned at the houses they went into, at the goods they handled, or at the persons or the people they came among. But so it was, that excepting that in Cripplegate parish, and two or three little eruptions of fires, which were presently extinguished, there was no disaster of that kind happened in the whole year. They told us a story of a house in a place called Swan Alley, passing from Goswell Street, near the end of Old Street, into St John Street, that a family was infected there in so terrible a manner that every one of the house died. The last person lay dead on the floor, and, as it is supposed, had lain herself all along to die just before the fire; the fire, it seems, had fallen from its place, being of wood, and had taken hold of the boards and the joists they lay on, and burnt as far as just to the body, but had not taken hold of the dead body (though she had little more than her shift on) and had gone out of itself, not burning the rest of the house, though it was a slight timber house. How true this might be I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>determine,</b> but the city being to suffer severely the next year by fire, this year it felt very little of that calamity.|$|E

60|$|In {{ordinary}} dreams we do {{not judge}} the objects to be real;--we simply <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>determine</b> that they are unreal. The sensations which they seem to produce, are in truth the causes and occasions of the images; {{of which there are}} two obvious proofs: first, that in dreams the strangest and most sudden metamorphoses do not create any sensation of surprise: and the second, that as to the most dreadful images, which during the dream were accompanied with agonies of terror, we merely awake, or turn round on the other side, and off fly both image and agony, which would be impossible if the sensations were produced by the images. This has always appeared to me an absolute demonstration of the true nature of ghosts and apparitions--such I mean of the tribe as were not pure inventions. Fifty years ago, (and to this day in the ruder parts of Great Britain and Ireland, in almost every kitchen and in too many parlours it is nearly the same,) you might meet persons who would assure you in the most solemn manner, so that you could not doubt their veracity at least, that they had seen an apparition of such and such a person,--in many cases, that the apparition had spoken to them; and they would describe themselves as having been in an agony of terror. They would tell you the story in perfect health. Now take the other class of facts, in which real ghosts have appeared;--I mean, where figures have been dressed up for the purpose of passing for apparitions:--in every instance I have known or heard of (and I have collected very many) the consequence has been either sudden death, or fits, or idiocy, or mania, or a brain fever. Whence comes the difference? evidently from this,--that in the one case the whole of the nervous system has been by slight internal causes gradually and all together brought into a certain state, the sensation of which is extravagantly exaggerated during sleep, and of which the images are the mere effects and exponents, as the motions of the weathercock are of the wind;--while in the other case, the image rushing through the senses upon a nervous system, wholly unprepared, actually causes the sensation, which is sometimes powerful enough to produce a total check, and almost always a lesion or inflammation. Who has not witnessed the difference in shock when we have leaped down half-a-dozen steps intentionally, and that of having missed a single stair. How comparatively severe the latter is! The fact really is, as to apparitions, that the terror produces the image instead of the contrary; for 'in omnem actum perceptionis influit imaginatio,' as says Wolfe.|$|E
60|$|A {{great part}} of these {{statements}} would have been acknowledged as true by M. Comte, and belong as much to his theory as to Mr Spencer's. The re-action of all other mental and social elements upon the intellectual not only is fully recognized by him, but his philosophy of history makes great use of it, {{pointing out that the}} principal intellectual changes could not have taken place unless changes in other elements of society had preceded; but also showing that these were themselves consequences of prior intellectual changes. It will not be found, on a fair examination of what M. Comte has written, that he has overlooked any of the truth that there is in Mr Spencer's theory. He would not indeed have said (what Mr Spencer apparently wishes us to say) that the effects which can be historically traced, for example to religion, were not produced by the belief in God, but by reverence and fear of him. He would have said that the reverence and fear presuppose the belief: that a God must be believed in before he can be feared or reverenced. The whole influence of the belief in a God upon society and civilization, depends on the powerful human sentiments which are ready to attach themselves to the belief; and yet the sentiments are only a social force at all, through the definite direction given to them by that or some other intellectual conviction; nor did the sentiments spontaneously throw up the belief in a God, since in themselves they were equally capable of gathering round some other object. Though it is true that men's passions and interests often dictate their opinions, or rather decide their choice among the two or three forms of opinion, which the existing condition of human intelligence renders possible, this disturbing cause is confined to morals, politics, and religion; and it is the intellectual movement in other regions than these, which {{is at the root of}} all the great changes in human affairs. It was not human emotions and passions which discovered the motion of the earth, or detected the evidence of its antiquity; which exploded Scholasticism, and inaugurated the exploration of nature; which invented printing, paper, and the mariner's compass. Yet the Reformation, the English and French revolutions, and still greater moral and social changes yet to come, are direct consequences of these and similar discoveries. Even alchemy and astrology were not believed because people thirsted for gold and were anxious to pry into the future, for these desires are as strong now as they were then: but because alchemy and astrology were conceptions natural to a particular stage in the growth of human knowledge, and consequently determined during that stage the particular means whereby the passions which always exist, sought their gratification. To say that men's intellectual beliefs <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>determine</b> their conduct, is like saying that the ship is moved by the steam and not by the steersman. The steam indeed is the motive power; the steersman, left to himself, could not advance the vessel a single inch; yet it is the steersman's will and the steersman's knowledge which decide in what direction it shall move and whither it shall go.|$|E
