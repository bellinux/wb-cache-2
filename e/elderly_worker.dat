40|$|Generous early {{retirement}} provisions {{account for a}} large proportion of the drop in the labour force participation of <b>elderly</b> <b>workers.</b> The aim of this paper is to provide a political-economic explanation of the wide spread adoption of {{early retirement}}. We suggest that the political support for generous early retirement provisions relies on: (i) the existence of an initial, significant group of redundant <b>elderly</b> <b>workers</b> with incomplete working history, who are not entitled to an old age pension; and (ii) the policy persistence that this provision introduces by inducing low-ability workers to retire early. The majority which supports a social security system with early retirement in a bidimensional voting game is composed of <b>elderly</b> <b>workers</b> with incomplete working history and low-ability workers. A descriptive analysis of eleven OECD countries confirms the relevance of the initial group of redundant <b>elderly</b> <b>workers.</b> Early retirement provisions were adopted during the deindustrialization process, almost always, immediately after the first severe decrease in industrial employment.

30|$|Austria {{introduced}} a special subsidy program for phased retirement schemes {{in the year}} 2000.

Austria traditionally has had a relatively high unemployment rate of <b>elderly</b> <b>workers</b> together with generally low participation and employment rates of the concerned age group: Given that labor demand is inflexible and does not provide enough part-time jobs for <b>elderly</b> <b>workers</b> who want such phased retirement, introducing subsidies might increase labor force attachment of <b>elderly</b> <b>workers.</b> On the other hand, allowing phased retirement might reduce labor force attachment because it can lead to a form of early retirement.|$|R
50|$|Another {{study found}} {{that it is not}} {{uncommon}} for employers to use stereotypes to rationalize discriminating against hiring elderly workers. The first of which is the employees’ salary expectations. If an older worker had a job before that had a higher salary, then he/she might keep looking for another job that has a high salary, so hiring him/her is a waste of time to the company. A second reason is that the <b>elderly</b> <b>worker</b> often will have a younger boss, so employers think that the older employee will not be satisfied working for someone who is younger or less experienced.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to suggest what {{direction}} skills development for <b>elderly</b> <b>workers</b> should be realized in companies and in what direction skill development policies should be developed in response to making the extension of the retirement age mandatory. This study’s results are as follows: First, the participation ratio for the vocational training of the <b>elderly</b> <b>workers</b> was lower than that of young and middle-aged workers. Moreover, voluntary participation rate of the <b>elderly</b> <b>workers</b> themselves was very low. Second, the execution of the <b>elderly</b> <b>worker’s</b> vocational training did {{have an effect on the}} increase in productivity. However, its effect is lower than that of young and middle-aged workers. Third, the companies were recognizing different problems that arose due to the extension of the retirement age. The main concerns were the increase in cost of labor, followed by skills obsolescence, mismatch between the competence demanded by the firm and the performance of the <b>elderly</b> <b>workers,</b> and lack of duties that could be accomplished by the <b>elderly</b> <b>workers.</b> Recognition of these problems confirmed that expanding vocational training investment in companies and relating these investments to the increase in productivity are the long-term goal for both government and companies to prevent the decrease in competence and performance of the <b>elderly</b> <b>workers.</b> Fourth, after the extension of the retirement age, companies had dominant consensus on the fact that there needs to be equal or more vocational training investments for the <b>elderly</b> <b>workers</b> than the past. At the same time, the companies were asking the government to provide: supports for the training fee of employment insuranceconsulting of human resources management in companiesdevelopment and supply of vocational training program specialized for the <b>elderly</b> <b>workers.</b> Fifth, despite the long-term characteristics of extending the retirement age, companies were just concerned with cutting down short-term cost of labor and as a result, the wage peak system was being considered as the major countermeasure for the extension of retirement age. On the other hand, there were limited opportunities to participate in the vocational training specialized for the <b>elderly</b> <b>workers,</b> which clearly showed the fact that there is a desperate need to reinforce the preparation for extending the retirement age.

The ideal system would be to increase the productivity of <b>elderly</b> <b>workers</b> through vocational training, which will eventually extend the retirement age without putting pressure on the companies. In order to do this, there needs to be a close cooperative system between workers, companies, and government. First, roles of the companies are the followings. Companies have to implement vocational training that is fit for each individual’s capability and positions. They also have to transform into a system that works around job functions when it comes down elderly workers’ personal management. Moreover, <b>elderly</b> <b>workers</b> should be relocated so that they would be positioned for a position more adequate for their age. Second, roles of the workers are the followings. <b>Elderly</b> <b>workers</b> have to actively participate in the vocational training. Participation of the labor union is also important, as they are the workers’ representative organization that can not only actively talk with the management to talk about the needs of vocational training but also induce management’s participation. Therefore, it is crucial to draw cooperation between labor and management. Third, roles of the government are the followings. The government needs to develop various policies in regards to the vocational training for the elderly workers: establish a differentiated policy to satisfy the diverse group of elderly workersset priority for certain target group and concentrate on supporting them extensivelyplan policies based on concrete analysis of the vocational training demands. Furthermore, a mandatory clause should be made in order to obligate the support of elderly workers’ vocational training as a measure for extending the retirement age.

The hypothesized structural model was tested using structural equation modelling. The results indicate that perceived work demands influence neck/shoulder musculoskeletal symptoms through their effect on felt stress. The results further indicate complete mediation, which means that all of the effect of the perceived work demands on symptoms could be attributed to the stress mechanism.
