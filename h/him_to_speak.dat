5|$|Brown's {{campaign}} faltered as {{the race}} {{drew to a}} close. Two weeks prior to the election, Brown was injured in a fall at Leitchfield; {{as a result of}} the injury, he was confined to his home and unable to deliver campaign speeches, despite several attempts to allow <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> from a chair or wheelchair. The final vote count gave Republican William S. Taylor a small plurality with 193,714 votes to Goebel's 191,331; Brown garnered only 12,140 votes.|$|E
5|$|In June 1943 he {{was given}} the job of {{registrar}} in the quarantine section at Birkenau sector BII, which allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to deportees selected as slave labour. He had his own office with a desk, chair and bunk bed. From the window he could see the lorries driving towards the gas chambers, and estimated that 10 percent of each transport was selected to work and the rest killed. By April 1944 he calculated that 1,750,000 Jews had been killed, a figure higher than that accepted by historians, but which decades later he still insisted was accurate.|$|E
5|$|In November 1938, Szilard {{moved to}} New York City, taking {{a room at}} the King's Crown Hotel near Columbia University. He {{encountered}} John R. Dunning, who invited <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> about his research at an afternoon seminar in January 1939. That month, Niels Bohr brought news to New York of the discovery of nuclear fission in Germany by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner, and Otto Frisch. When Szilard found out about it on a visit to Wigner at Princeton University, he immediately realized that uranium might be the element capable of sustaining a chain reaction.|$|E

50|$|Finally on 12 October 1840, Henry Clay freed Charlotte Dupuy and her {{daughter}} Mary Ann in New Orleans. He retained her son Charles Dupuy, who traveled with <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>speaking</b> engagements. Clay frequently used him {{as an example of}} how well he treated slaves. He eventually freed Charles in 1844.|$|R

5|$|Once in Buenos Aires, Castelli {{found himself}} in {{political}} isolation. The triumvirate and the newspaper La Gazeta blamed him for the defeat at Huaqui, and sought punishment as a deterrent. His former supporters were divided between those who supported {{the ideas of the}} Triumvirate and those no longer able to help. Castelli suffered from tongue cancer during the long trial, which made it progressively more difficult for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> He died on October 12, 1812, while the trial was still underway.|$|E
5|$|After Hitler {{took control}} in Germany in 1933, Borah thought {{well of the}} new chancellor's {{repudiation}} of the war guilt and other clauses of the Versailles treaty, and saw much of value in his new social and economic programs. But he was utterly disgusted and alienated by the Nazi treatment of the Jews. This did not initially lead <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> out against Nazi Germany, though many urged him to do so, as he felt that each nation {{had the right to}} run its own affairs. Borah opposed large-scale immigration by Jews from Germany, feeling that was impractical with millions of Americans unemployed. By 1938, Borah was speaking out against the continued persecutions, but still felt that the European issue could be settled if Germany's former colonies were returned. After the Munich Conference in September 1938, Borah issued a statement far more critical of Britain and France for deceiving Czechoslovakia into dismemberment, than of Germany for her aggression.|$|E
5|$|Having {{resigned}} the Bishopric of Chiapas, Las Casas {{spent the}} rest of his life working closely with the imperial court in matters relating to the Indies. In 1551 he rented a cell at the College of San Gregorio, where he lived with his assistant and friend Fray Rodrigo de Ladrada. He continued working as a kind of procurator for the natives of the Indies, many of whom directed petitions to <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to the Emperor on their behalf. Sometimes indigenous nobility even related their cases to him in Spain, for example, the Nahua noble Francisco Tenamaztle from Nochistlán. His influence at court was so great that some even considered that he had the final word in choosing the members of the Council of the Indies.|$|E

5|$|People who stutter include British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, orator Demosthenes, King George VI, actor James Earl Jones, {{and country}} singer Mel Tillis. Churchill, whose stutter was {{particularly}} apparent to 1920s writers, {{was one of}} the 30% of stutterers who have an associated speech disorder—a lisp in his case—yet led his nation through World War II. Demosthenes stammered and was inarticulate as a youth, yet, through dedicated practice, using methods such as placing pebbles in his mouth, became a great orator of Ancient Greece. King George VI hired speech therapist Lionel Logue to enable <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to his Empire, and Logue effectively helped him accomplish this goal. This training and its results are the focus of the 2010 film The King's Speech. James Earl Jones has stated he was mute for many years of his youth yet he became an actor noted for the power of his voice. Mel Tillis stutters when talking but not when singing. Many people had their speech impediment only as a child and have overcome their condition.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after being}} hired {{he was taken}} aside by the news {{producer}} and asked to read the on-air bulletin for the nightly broadcast. He read the news for three months until one night when he condensed a six-minute bulletin into three minutes. He attributed this to stage fright, which caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> too fast. The rest of the production crew were not {{ready to move on}} to the next news items, leaving Harries standing in silence for several minutes. Harries recalled in a 2007 interview that Steve Morrison, the producer of the bulletin, called him into his office and berated him, telling him he did not deserve to be on television and that he would no longer be reading the news. Morrison's remarks angered Harries to such a point that he assaulted the man. Aware that he was going to lose his job, he contacted a Granada colleague who got him a new job at Granada's London centre, which he took up at the age of 23.|$|E
5|$|Diana {{discovers that}} Paul {{has written a}} story about her in his {{newspaper}} and she confronts him. Diana tells him that she {{will have a lot}} of job offers in New York, but Paul says that no one will be interested as she is toxic. Diana's plane ticket is cancelled and she is thrown out of the hotel by Paul. She asks Declan for help and he tells her that Paul keeps his business papers in the home safe. Diana kisses Paul, {{and at the same time}} she takes his house keys from his pocket and she breaks into his house. Diana does not find anything and, in anger, she smashes Paul's possessions. Diana calls a mystery person and arranges for them to hurt Paul. She then goes to Rebecca and tells her about her husband's affair. Someone goes to the Lassiter's mezzanine and pushes Paul from it. Detective Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) discovers one of Diana's earrings at the scene and he stops her at the airport. During questioning, Diana tells <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to Rebecca again after revealing her affair with Paul. Andrew, Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) and Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) follow Diana and see her meeting with Jack Ward (Peter Lowrey), a hitman she called on the night Paul was pushed. Natasha retrieves Jack's phone and the group listen to a message left by Diana, telling him to leave town. Andrew confronts Diana at her hotel and Mark arrives to arrest her for conspiracy to commit murder. Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) receives some emails telling her that Diana did not push Paul and she goes to see her. Diana tells Susan that she has been formally charged, but insists that she is innocent. She realises that Susan believes her and she begs Susan to help. Diana is later released.|$|E

25|$|In 1912, W. E. B. Du Bois, {{president}} of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), publicly challenged NAWSA's reluctance to accept black women. The NAWSA responded in a cordial way, inviting <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> at its next convention and publishing his speech as a pamphlet.|$|E
25|$|The former Prime Minister David Lloyd George, who was {{in office}} {{during the last two}} years of World War One, now spoke. Members had to call upon <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> up: he was now 77, and it was to be his last major {{contribution}} to debate in the House in which he had sat for 50 years. He told Members that he was a Welshman and would warm up once he got going: he did.|$|E
25|$|Hall began {{acting as}} a student at Cambridge University, where Dadie Rylands taught <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> Shakespearean verse. He was also {{influenced}} in his understanding of Shakespeare by the literary critic and teacher F. R. Leavis. He subsequently acted in three German films in the 1970s: Der Fußgänger (The Pedestrian, directed by Maximilian Schell, 1973), Als Mutter streikte (When Mother Went on Strike, 1974) and Der letzte Schrei (The Last Word, 1974).|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} quarter of 1983, Aquino {{received}} news about the deteriorating political situation in his country and the rumored declining health of President Marcos (due to lupus). He believed that it was expedient for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to Marcos and present to him his rationale for the country's return to democracy, before extremists took over and made such a change impossible. Moreover, his years of absence made his allies worry that the Filipinos might have resigned themselves to Marcos' strongman rule and that without his leadership the centrist opposition would die a natural death.|$|E
25|$|In 1724, he {{was offered}} the chair of {{mathematics}} at Uppsala University, but he declined {{and said that he}} had dealt mainly with geometry, chemistry and metallurgy during his career. He also said {{that he did not have}} the gift of eloquent speech because of a stutter, as recognized by many of his acquaintances; it forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> slowly and carefully, and there are no known occurrences of his speaking in public. The Swedish critic Olof Lagerkrantz proposed that Swedenborg compensated for his impediment by extensive argumentation in writing.|$|E
25|$|Independent architects had to join state projects, {{switch to}} bureaucratic jobs (Victor Vesnin) or quit (like Melnikov did). Reconstruction of Moscow project {{was set up}} as 10 state {{architectural}} workshops, roughly corresponding to the radial sectors of the city. Zholtovsky was invited to lead Workshop No.1; like other old architects (Shchusev, Vladimir Shchuko, Ivan Fomin), he fitted perfectly in Stalin’s system. His educational work was in high esteem: in 1935 and 1937 Politbureau appointed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> on education at the forthcoming Congress of Architects (this Congress was delayed twice, and each time list of speakers was approved at the very top).|$|E

25|$|Albert Einstein {{was widely}} known during his {{lifetime}} for his work with the theory of relativity and physics in general. His political opinions were of public interest {{through the middle of}} the 20th century due to his fame and involvement in political, humanitarian and academic projects around the world. He was often called upon to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics. Einstein's visible position in society allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> and write frankly, even provocatively, {{at a time when many}} people were silenced due to the rise of the Nazi movement.|$|E
25|$|In October 1560 Nicholas Throckmorton heard Cleutin {{was out of}} favour in France due to his {{opposition}} to the plan to execute the Protestant lords, but was given leave to go home to Villeparis. In September 1561 Cleutin visited Throckmorton in Paris, saying he had been a friend to Mary, Queen of Scots and the House of Guise. Cleutin then travelled to London to obtain a passport and safe-conduct for Mary, Queen of Scots' voyage to Scotland. Elizabeth did not oblige, wishing Mary to ratify the Treaty of Edinburgh which d'Oisel had helped draft, and kept d'Oisel waiting. William Maitland approved of this, but learnt that Mary would sail anyway. On 6 October 1561 Throckmorton went to the Hôtel de Guise and d'Oysel brought <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to the Duke himself.|$|E
25|$|Henry John Temple {{was born}} in his family's Westminster house to the Irish branch of the Temple family on 20 October 1784. Henry was to become The 3rd Viscount Palmerston upon his father's death in 1802. His family derived their title from the Peerage of Ireland, {{although}} the 3rd Viscount would almost never visit Ireland. His father was The 2nd Viscount Palmerston (1739–1802), an Anglo-Irish peer, {{and his mother was}} Mary (1752–1805), a daughter of Benjamin Mee, a London merchant. From 1792 to 1794, the young future Lord Palmerston accompanied his family on a long Continental tour. Whilst in Italy Palmerston acquired an Italian tutor, who taught <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> and write fluent Italian.
