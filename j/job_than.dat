50|$|Transit and bicycle/pedestrian {{projects}} {{create more}} construction <b>jobs</b> <b>than</b> traditional roadway jobs: Complete Streets projects funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 created more <b>jobs</b> <b>than</b> projects on road repair and new construction. Under the stimulus, transit projects created {{nearly twice the}} job hours for every $1 billion than highway projects. Pedestrian and bicycle projects create between 1.8 and 3.8 more <b>jobs</b> <b>than</b> auto-only projects. This job creation, however, is not a free lunch since it requires greater government expenditure.|$|R

5|$|Truck drivers {{spend up to}} 11hours a day driving, and up to 14hours a day {{engaged in}} various duties (including driving time) such as fueling, filling out paperwork, obtaining vehicle repairs, and {{conducting}} mandatory vehicle inspections. Long-haul drivers often spend weeks away from home, spending their time off and sleeping at truck stops or rest areas. Driving is relatively dangerous work, as truck drivers account for 12 percent and the highest total number of all work-related deaths, and are five {{times more likely to}} die on the <b>job</b> <b>than</b> the average worker. Smoking, lack of exercise, unhealthy eating habits, and work-related injuries also contribute to the driver's generally risk-prone lifestyle. A survey by the National Institutes of Health found 67 percent of long-haul drivers were smokers or had quit smoking.|$|E
5|$|The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System {{was built}} entirely with unionized labor. Because {{construction}} was slumping in the United States at large, the pipeline drew workers {{from across the}} country. These workers had to follow a strict hiring process based on union seniority and the labor that was needed. Priority was given to hiring Alaska residents and Alaska Natives, and no strikes were permitted by a labor agreement between Alyeska and the unions. In exchange for abiding by these restrictions, workers were paid extremely well and received fringe benefits. According to the labor contract, every worker was guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week, even if weather made work impossible. In addition, subcontractors had cost-plus contracts with Alyeska for staffing, {{so there was no}} incentive to keep staffing levels low. These factors often led to more people being assigned to a <b>job</b> <b>than</b> there was work to do in an attempt to make up time lost to weather delays. At the peak of construction in fall 1975, more than 28,000 people were working on the pipeline. Fourteen to 19 percent of the workers were minorities, and 5 to 10 percent were women. Because of the high turnover on the project, more than 70,000 people worked on at least a part of the pipeline.|$|E
25|$|However, neither {{group of}} {{countries}} was pro-gender {{equality in the}} sense that policies aimed at equal rights between the sexes are popular. In Arab countries, 82% of survey respondents believe that a man has more right to a <b>job</b> <b>than</b> a woman while 63% of respondents from the non-Arab countries felt the same way. These researchers attributed these attitudes to the strong religious identity and adherence of respondents thus implicating Islam in promoting gender inequality in majority Muslim nations.|$|E

Peer mentors appear mainly in secondary schools where students moving up from primary schools may need assistance in settling into the whole new schedule and lifestyle of secondary school life. Peer mentoring is also used in the workplace {{as a means of}} orienting new employees.

The venom is somewhat different in that it contains substantial amounts of serotonin and related tryptamine compounds (Welsh, 1967).

25|$|In his 1998 {{documentary}} Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows, Hart {{said that}} his fears were largely assuaged because he was close friends with referee Earl Hebner and trusted him implicitly. Asked by Hart, Hebner swore by his children {{that he would never}} double-cross Hart and that he would rather quit his <b>job</b> <b>than</b> participate in a screwjob. However, according to Michaels' account of the events in his 2005 autobiography, Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story, Michaels himself informed Hebner of the plan only on Sunday evening, just as Survivor Series was about to commence. This contradicted what Hebner said on a 2003 edition of WWE Confidential, claiming that he first knew of McMahon's plan only ten minutes before the match finished, and out of panic following the bell ringing, he ran out of the ring, through the crowd and remained in his hotel room for the night, refusing to speak to anyone.|$|E
25|$|After the 1964 season, Chuck Fairbanks, an {{assistant}} coach at Houston, was offered a job at Tennessee. He wanted to accept, {{but it was the}} middle of the summer and unusually late for a coaching move, so he decided to stay loyal to Houston and remained there. After the next season, he was offered a position as {{an assistant}} on Mackenzie's staff at Oklahoma, a position he felt was a better <b>job</b> <b>than</b> the Tennessee position. Immediately after the 1965 season, Fairbanks was offered a job at Missouri with the promise that he would be the head coach within four years. He declined and stayed at Oklahoma. Four months later, Coach Mackenzie died and Fairbanks was named head coach. It did not take long for Fairbanks to turn the team around. In his first season in 1967, his squad went 10–1. They entered their sixth game with a 5–1 record (their only loss was a two-point loss to rival Texas) and unranked and beat ninth ranked Colorado, 23–0. This propelled Fairbanks's team to a number eight ranking. They continued their romp through the season and beat #2 Tennessee 26–24 in the Orange Bowl. They finished the season ranked number three in the country.|$|E
500|$|The Byrds {{moved quickly}} to record a self-produced {{follow-up}} to Byrdmaniax, {{in an attempt to}} stem the criticism that the album was receiving in the music press and as a reaction to their own dislike of Melcher's overproduction. [...] Johnny Rogan has speculated that the Byrds' decision to produce their next album themselves was an attempt on the band's part to prove that they could do a better <b>job</b> <b>than</b> Melcher had done on their previous record. [...] While in England for an appearance at the Lincoln Folk Festival, the Byrds decamped to CBS Studios in London with engineer Mike Ross and between July 22 and 28, 1971, they recorded an album's worth of new material.|$|E

50|$|Even though women hold fewer <b>jobs</b> <b>than</b> men in some societies, women hold jobs {{of higher}} {{prestige}} {{than their male}} counterparts. This is probably {{because it is not}} beneficial for women who are married with children {{to go out and get}} lower-paying, lower status jobs because the economic benefits cancel themselves out in the end. Married working women also hold less prestigious <b>jobs</b> <b>than</b> their spouses. This is partially because married people tend to share the same economic backgrounds as well as education levels, and partially because in the process of evolutions, sexual dimorphism has triggered women to prefer wealthy husbands.|$|R

The Conservative candidate, Edmund Brocklebank, was much stronger than in the previous election, and the left-wing vote was split because he was also campaigning against Tom Mann, a noted Communist.

500|$|Andy Hoyos was the art {{director}} for Phantasmagoria, and Kim White, Brandee Prugh and Brian Judy {{were among the}} computer artists. It was the first computer game Prugh worked on. Mark Hood, a veteran Sierra programmer, and Mark Seibert served as Phantasmagoria project managers. Seibert called managing the project [...] "much more of a technical and managerial problem-solving <b>job</b> <b>than</b> I ever envisioned". Unlike previous Sierra games, it also involved managing {{a great deal of}} outside resources, such as keeping the studio and outside art contractors on schedule. The game's three-dimensional graphics were among the first rendered on Silicon Graphics software. In creating the look of the game, Hoyos drew particular inspiration from the films of Tim Burton, and he particularly tried to emulate the lighting, sets and [...] "imaginative edge" [...] of Batman (1989). Other influences included the films Alien (1979) and Hellraiser (1987). Phantasmagoria was designed using the 3-D software package Alias. Hoyos started by designing the rooms, then created the furniture, and added textures and lighting. Once complete, the computer rendered final images of each room, which became the backgrounds for the game. While most computer games at the time had between 80 and 100 background pictures, Phantasmagoria had more than 1,000.|$|E
