2500|$|... he {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the loss of control in flight {{as a result of}} a malfunction of the left engine propeller control unit which allowed the propeller blade angles to go below the flight <b>idle</b> <b>position.</b> Contributing to the accident was the deficient design of the propeller control unit by Hamilton Standard and the approval of the design by the Federal Aviation Administration. The design did not correctly evaluate the failure mode that occurred during this flight, which resulted in an uncommanded and uncorrectable movement of the blades of the airplane’s left propeller below the flight <b>idle</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a valve arrangement, in particular {{for use in}} pneumatic controls. Since pneumatically activated actuators have a certain leakage rate, the control valve (pilot valve) must remain in permanently open state {{in order to maintain}} the actuator in the open position. This requires high holding forces. The valve arrangement according to the invention, however, consumes energy only for the switchover process from one state to the other and can maintain the selected state without the use of any energy. This is achieved by means of an inlet and an outlet valve, whereby at least the inlet valve is a microvalve which has an <b>idle</b> <b>position</b> in addition to the open and the closed <b>positions.</b> In the <b>idle</b> <b>position,</b> there is a gap between the closing element and the valve seat of the microvalve, said gap being so dimensioned that the leakage rate of the actuator is compensated by the gas flowing through the gap. No energy is consumed in the <b>idle</b> <b>position</b> assumed by the valve when n o external forces are acting on it. In a special design, the valve closes automatically when a defined pressure difference exists...|$|R

A single MSDT involves testing k specimens simultaneously until the rth failure. The traditional sudden death test (SDT) is a special case when r = 1. The complete MSDT plan consists of g single MSDTs run in sequence. When r ? 1, there can be up to r Γ 1 <b>idle</b> test <b>positions</b> at any time. We propose testing "standby" specimens in the <b>idle</b> <b>positions</b> and use simulation to gauge the improvement over the basic MSDT plan.

50|$|The issue {{involves}} a friction device in the pedal {{designed to provide}} the proper “feel” by adding resistance and making the pedal steady and stable. This friction device includes a “shoe” that rubs against an adjoining surface during normal pedal operation. Due to the materials used, wear and environmental conditions, these surfaces may, over time, begin to stick and release instead of operating smoothly. In some cases, friction could increase {{to a point that}} the pedal is slow to return to the <b>idle</b> <b>position</b> or, in rare cases, the pedal sticks, leaving the throttle partially open.|$|R
50|$|When {{the driver}} presses on the {{accelerator}} pedal, the throttle plate rotates within the throttle body, opening the throttle passage to allow more air into the intake manifold. Usually an airflow sensor measures this change and communicates with the ECU. The ECU then increases the amount of fuel {{being sent to the}} fuel injectors in order to obtain the desired air-fuel ratio. Often a throttle position sensor (TPS) is connected to the shaft of the throttle plate to provide the ECU with information on whether the throttle is in the <b>idle</b> <b>position,</b> wide-open throttle (WOT) position, or somewhere in between these extremes.|$|R

During climb, A/T maintains constant climb power; in descent, A/T retards the throttle to <b>IDLE</b> <b>position,</b> and so on. When A/T is working in thrust mode, speed is controlled by pitch (or the control column), and NOT protected by A/T. A radar altimeter feeds data to the autothrottle mostly in this mode.

5000|$|The captain, faced {{now with}} a sudden time {{pressure}} and all mechanical locks being removed, and {{with his hand on}} the power levers, may have unintentionally moved the power levers further backwards, passing through the ground <b>idle</b> <b>position,</b> towards full reverse. This shift to reverse power triggered a propeller overspeed that was heard and noticed by the crew. Feeling a tremendous increase in drag and a sudden deceleration, one of the crew members retracted the flaps. The power levers were then moved forward, but it was too late. A few seconds later, the aircraft crashed into the ground.|$|R

5|$|The {{investigation}} {{concluded the}} accident sequence {{began when the}} check pilot, while the aircraft was on the ground, retarded the throttle lever for No. 4 engine past the <b>idle</b> <b>position,</b> and therefore reversed the propellers of that engine. Once the airplane took off and started banking to the right, {{it would have been}} a natural reaction for one of the flight crew to increase power to No. 4 engine, thinking that by doing so the engine would start producing positive thrust and the aircraft could be recovered. However, since the metal flag was not raised, there was no electrical power to the rotating mechanismsand increasing power to No. 4 engine would only have created more reverse thrust.|$|R
50|$|The {{safety system}} cable, {{responsible}} for pulling the power lever to the <b>idle</b> <b>position,</b> {{was no longer}} able to withstand the physical strain of being pulled one way by the actuator, while the copilot forced it the other way by pushing the throttle lever to the fully open position - the cable soon parted at a maintenance connection. With the lever no longer restrained by the safety system, the copilot continued to hold the right throttle fully open. The combination of the right engine at full thrust in reverse and the left engine still at normal forward take-off thrust caused the aircraft to roll violently to the right and descend into the ground.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} a nearby {{two-level}} charge fluctuator on a double-dot two-spin qubit are studied theoretically. Assuming no direct tunneling between the charge fluctuator and the qubit quantum dots, the Coulomb couplings between the qubit orbital states and the fluctuator are calculated within the Hund-Mulliken framework to quadrupole-quadrupole order in a multipole expansion. We identify and quantify the coupling term that entangles the qubit to the fluctuator and analyze qubit decoherence effects that result from the decay of the fluctuator to its reservoir. Our {{results show that the}} charge environment can severely impact the performance of spin qubits, and indicate working points at which this decoherence channel is minimized. Our analysis also suggests that an ancillary double-dot can provide a convenient point for single-qubit operations and <b>idle</b> <b>position,</b> adding flexibility in the quantum control of the two-spin qubit.

50|$|The Trofimoff {{piston valve}} {{consisted}} of two fixed discs secured to the valve spindle, and two junk rings, each carrying a bull ring and four valve rings and both free to move longitudinally on the spindle. When the regulator is opened, steam forces the loose valve bodies against their respective fixed discs and they then act as units, similar to ordinary piston valves. When steam is shut off, the loose valve heads become detached from their respective discs and remain in their <b>idle</b> <b>positions</b> near {{the centre of the}} steam chest, while the valve spindle and fixed disks continue their reciprocating motion with the spindle sliding freely through the now stationary loose valve heads, and with the steam and exhaust ports now in communi&shy;ca&shy;tion.

50|$|Perhaps {{the strangest}} failure that Nagano {{suffered}} {{was in the}} 16th competition in December 2005. Nagano once again had made his way {{towards the end of}} the 3rd Stage. Nagano took his time and rested on the green pipe directly before the Devil's Swing obstacle that led to the Pipe Slider. Instead of trying to generate momentum from an <b>idle</b> <b>position</b> on the trapeze-like Devil's Swing, Nagano instead hung from the green bar, grasped the Devil's Swing with one arm, and held onto the green pipe with the other. He then swung back and forth, eliminating most of the effort needed to get to the Pipe Slider. However, one of the chains on the Devil's Swing got caught on the green pipe. Nagano eventually got himself free, and even grasped the Pipe Slider with one hand, but he couldn't hold on. When he let go, the orange pipe slid a short ways down the track. With no choice but to generate as much momentum as he could, Nagano fell short of the pipe on his jump and plunged into the water.|$|R

50|$|The engine's high {{operating}} {{speeds and}} temperatures required a new jet fuel, JP-7. Its reluctance to be ignited required triethylborane (TEB) to be {{injected into the}} engine to ignite it and the afterburner. Above −5 °C, TEB spontaneously ignites in contact with air. Each engine carried a nitrogen-pressurized sealed tank with 600 cm3 (20.7 ounces) of TEB, sufficient for at least 16 starts, restarts, or afterburner lights; this number {{was one of the}} limiting factors of SR-71 endurance, as after each air refueling the afterburners had to be reignited. When the pilot moved the throttle from cut-off to <b>idle</b> <b>position,</b> fuel flowed into the engine, and shortly afterwards an approx. 50 cm3 (1.7 ounce) shot of TEB was injected into the combustion chamber, where it spontaneously ignited and lit the fuel with a green flash. In some conditions, however, the TEB flow was obstructed by coking deposits on the injector nozzle, hindering restart attempts. Refilling the TEB tank was a perilous task; the maintenance crew wore silver fire suits. Conversely, the JP-7 fueling was so safe that some aircraft maintenance was permitted during filling. The chemical ignition was chosen instead of a conventional igniter for reliability reasons, and to reduce mechanical complexity. The TEB tank is cooled with fuel flowing around it, and contains a disk that ruptures in case of overpressure, allowing TEB and nitrogen to discharge into the afterburner.|$|R

500|$|At {{the moment}} of touchdown, the spoiler lever was in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position. According to the system logic of the A320's flight controls, {{in order for the}} {{spoilers}} to automatically deploy upon touchdown not only must the spoiler lever be in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position, but both thrust levers must be at or close to the [...] "idle" [...] position. The FDR transcript shows that immediately after the warning, the flight computer recorded the left thrust lever being retarded to the rear-most position, activating the thrust reverser on the left engine, while the right thrust lever (controlling the engine with the disabled thrust reverser) remained in the CL position. One theory put forth by CENIPA is that the pilots may not have noticed that the right engine remained at CL because the Airbus autothrottle system, unlike other aircraft manufacturers, does not automatically move the levers when the autothrust controller changes engine settings. Therefore, the pilots may have thought that the right engine was at idle power without realizing that Airbus autothrust logic dictates that, when {{one or more of the}} thrust levers is pulled to the <b>idle</b> <b>position,</b> the autothrust is automatically disengaged. Thus, when the pilot pulled the left engine thrust lever to idle, it disconnected the autothrust system and the computer did not retard the right engine power to idle. The A320's spoilers did not deploy during the landing run, as the right thrust lever was above the [...] "idle" [...] setting required for automatic spoiler deployment. Since the right engine thrust lever was still in the [...] "climb" [...] detent at that time, the right engine accelerated to climb power while the left engine deployed its thrust reverser. The resulting asymmetric thrust condition resulted in a loss of control and a crash ensued.|$|R
