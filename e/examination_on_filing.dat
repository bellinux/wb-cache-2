40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} {{the results of a}} {{long-term}} study of ransomware attacks that have been observed in the wild between 2006 and 2014. We also pro-vide a holistic view on how ransomware attacks have evolved during this period by analyzing 1, 359 samples that belong to 15 different ransomware families. Our results show that, despite a continuous improvement in the encryption, deletion, and communication techniques in the main ransomware families, the number of families with sophisticated destructive capabilities remains quite small. In fact, our analysis reveals that in a large number of samples, the malware simply locks the victim’s computer desktop or attempts to encrypt or delete the victim’s files using only superficial techniques. Our analysis also suggests that stopping ad-vanced ransomware attacks is not as complex as it has been previously reported. For example, we show that by monitoring abnormal file system activity, it is pos-sible to design a practical defense system that could stop a large number of ran-somware attacks, even those using sophisticated encryption capabilities. A close <b>examination</b> <b>on</b> the <b>file</b> system activities of multiple ransomware samples sug-gests that by looking at I/O requests and protecting Master File Table (MFT) in the NTFS file system, it is possible to detect and prevent a significant number of zero-day ransomware attacks...|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} <b>examination</b> {{of cases}} <b>on</b> <b>file</b> with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection was undertaken {{to identify a}} universe of VOC contaminated sites {{in close proximity to}} buildings. Such locations were grouped according to site variables, such as contaminants of concern and concentrations in various media; soil type; depth to groundwater; distance to building; and building construction. Indoor air, soil gas, and/or groundwater field data collected from these sites was then assembled and used to: (1) evaluate available transport models which describe the intrusion of vapors into buildings and predict indoor air contaminant concentrations resulting from the volatilization of VOCs in the subsurface; (2) examine the validity of established regulatory criteria; (3) identify specific trends and field conditions which appear to most influence vapor phase contaminant migration and intrusion processes; and (4) evaluate the possibility of vapor migration being inhibited by a "fresh water lens"...|$|R
40|$|The task 'Investigations of {{processing}} possibilities' {{as a part}} of the complex project for exemplary treatment of dump material and planning of a pilot plant contains in the first step: (a) research on history and real state of investigated dumps, (b) creation of technical pre-conditions for the planned investigations. Starting from <b>examination</b> of <b>files</b> <b>on</b> the deposit of waste products containing harmful substances statements on useable materials are to make by mechanical sorting and sizing techniques. The waste fractions necessary for thermal and biological treatment have to be produced. The whole of all this treatment methods with the aim of recycling, removal of harmful substances and stabilization as well as reduction of volume of the deposited waste is useful for analogous dump sites.
