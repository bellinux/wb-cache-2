5|$|Hypertrophic scars are uncommon, and are {{characterized}} by increased collagen content after the abnormal healing response. They are described as firm and raised from the skin. Hypertrophic scars remain within the original margins of the wound, whereas <b>keloid</b> scars can form scar tissue outside of these borders. <b>Keloid</b> scars from acne occur more often in men and people with darker skin, and usually occur on {{the trunk of the}} body.|$|E
25|$|<b>Keloid</b> scars {{can occur}} on anyone, {{but they are}} most common in dark-skinned people. They {{can be caused by}} surgery, accident, acne or, sometimes, body piercings.

However, they can be itchy or painful in some individuals. They tend to be most common on the shoulders and chest. Hypertrophic scars and keloids tend to be more common in wounds closed by secondary intention. Surgical removal of <b>keloid</b> is risky and may excerbate the condition and worsening of the <b>keloid.</b>|$|E

50|$|Keloids: <b>Keloids</b> {{are raised}} scars. <b>Keloiding</b> {{can be a}} result of genetics, skin colour (darker skin types are more prone to <b>keloiding),</b> or irritation. <b>Keloids</b> are often sought for a visual, 3-D effect and for tactile effects.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Keloids</b> are benign tumors {{arising from}} {{abnormal}} healing of the skin, {{and there are}} several procedures available for their treatment. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the outcomes of patients undergoing treatment of <b>keloids</b> after ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgeries at our service center. Method: We conducted thorough, retrospective and prospective analysis of records of patients undergoing treatment of retroauricular <b>keloids</b> at our center. Results: Nine patients were evaluated, and 6 underwent resection and adjuvant beta-therapy, 2 underwent resection with local application of corticosteroids, and only 1 underwent resection without adjuvant therapy. There was no recurrence of <b>keloids</b> in patients that were treated with beta-therapy in the early postoperative period. One patient had relapsed despite corticosteroid administration and late beta-therapy. Discussion: Several techniques have been used for the treatment of retroauricular <b>keloids,</b> and beta-therapy is thought to yield the best results, followed by the use of intralesional corticosteroids. Conclusion: Treatment of retroauricular <b>keloids</b> remains a challenge. While new techniques are being developed, resection followed by early beta-therapy is still the best treatment option...|$|R

25|$|All {{scarring}} {{is composed}} of the same collagen as the tissue it has replaced, but {{the composition of the}} scar tissue, compared to the normal tissue, is different. Scar tissue also lacks elasticity unlike normal tissue which distributes fiber elasticity. Scars differ in the amounts of collagen overexpressed. Labels have been applied to the differences in overexpression. Two of the most common types are hypertrophic and <b>keloid</b> scarring, both of which experience excessive stiff collagen bundled growth overextending the tissue, blocking off regeneration of tissues. Another form is atrophic scarring (sunken scarring), which also has an overexpression of collagen blocking regeneration. This scar type is sunken, because the collagen bundles do not overextend the tissue. Stretch marks (striae) are regarded as scars by some.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{treatment}} intent (curative, adjuvant, neoadjuvant therapeutic, or palliative) {{will depend}} on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. Total body irradiation (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a bone marrow transplant. Brachytherapy, in which a radioactive source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs. Radiation therapy has several applications in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, acoustic neuromas, severe thyroid eye disease, pterygium, pigmented villonodular synovitis, and prevention of <b>keloid</b> scar growth, vascular restenosis, and heterotopic ossification. The use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions is limited partly by worries about the risk of radiation-induced cancers.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Due to its {{potential}} effects on skin microcirculation and collagen metabolism, the 585 nm flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser {{has been proposed}} for treating abnormal scars. Indeed, {{one of the main}} problems with keloidal scars is their disfiguring erythematous color. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of the 585 nm pulsed dye laser on the appearance of <b>keloids.</b> METHODS: Eleven patients with skin phototypes II-IV and <b>keloids</b> were treated with the 585 nm pulsed dye laser. After one to three treatment sessions, clinical assessments of the scars were performed in combination with remittance spectroscopy measurements of the redness and melanin pigmentation. A group of nine <b>keloids</b> covered by silicone gel sheeting served as controls. Data were compared statistically. RESULTS: During laser treatments, a discrete decrease in redness of the scars was clinically reported. However, this improvement was not confirmed by the objective spectrophotometric data. No side effects, especially hyperpigmentation, were disclosed. The <b>keloids</b> redness was not improved in the control group. CONCLUSION: The 585 nm pulsed dye laser yields only minimal effects, if any, on the erythema of <b>keloids.</b> Similarly silicone gel sheeting does not modify the <b>keloids</b> redness.

40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityHypertrophic {{scars and}} <b>keloids</b> {{are a common}} problem, {{particularly}} in people with dark skin. Nurse practitioners frequently {{need to know how}} to effectively treat this type of scarring. The objective of this literature review is to compare treatment options based on available literature to determine the best treatment. Multiple databases were used to research treatment options for hypertrophic scars and <b>keloids.</b> Statistics for each type of treatment were reviewed. Treatment options for hypertrophic scars and <b>keloids</b> included in this review are, intralesional injection, laser treatment, radiofrequency, silicone and excision in combination with intralesional steroid injection. The only treatment found to treat and prevent recurrence of <b>keloids</b> is excision combined with intralesional steroid injection. Other treatment options researched help to minimize symptoms, but do not entirely eliminate the scar. The best treatment option to eliminate <b>keloids</b> and prevent recurrence is excision and intralesional steroid injection.

40|$|Background: <b>Keloids</b> are cosmetically disfiguring benign fibrous outgrowths, which {{present as}} a major {{therapeutic}} dilemma due to their frequent recurrence. Despite a wide therapeutic armamentarium available for these scars, none {{has been found to}} be completely effective and satisfactory. Cryosurgery has offered some promise in the treatment of <b>keloids.</b> We conducted this study to evaluate the effect of cryotherapy in treatment of <b>keloids</b> and to relate the treatment outcome with the clinico-etiological factors. Materials and Methods: A hospital-based interventional study was conducted in 30 patients of <b>keloids.</b> Patients received two freeze thaw cycles of 15 seconds each at four weekly intervals for six sessions or flattening greater than 75 %; whichever occurred earlier. Patients were assessed after three treatment sessions and at treatment completion regarding thickness and firmness of lesions. Patient satisfaction scale was used to evaluate the treatment outcome at completion of six treatment sessions. Paired Students t-test and Analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for statistical analysis. Results: Average flattening noted after 3 and 6 sessions of cryotherapy was 30. 76 % and 58. 13 %, respectively. The duration of lesions and thickness of <b>keloids</b> correlated significantly with the result of treatment. The site and aetiology did not influence the outcome of cryosurgical treatment. Conclusion: Cryotherapy seems to be an effective treatment modality for <b>keloids</b> of recent onset, particularly smaller lesions. Duration and thickness of the <b>keloids</b> were found to be the most important factors in determining treatment outcome with cryotherapy in our study.

40|$|Up to date, <b>Keloids</b> {{constitute}} {{a serious problem}} for all medical specialties, in spite the multiple studies concerning their treatment. Their causative mechanism also remains unresolved despite the accumulation of new information concerning the collagen metabolism. So far, {{there has not been}} found any method, individual or combined, with constant and catholic success, since <b>keloids</b> have a recurrence rate of 55 to 100 % with negative psychological effects, worsened often from functional handing-over with aesthetic disturbances, itching, burning sensation, and pain. We created a model of seborrheic cleaning of the skin and its ducts preoperatively promoting the thought and assess that the release of sebum from the trauma of sebaceous glands provokes the development of <b>keloids.</b> Moreover, our thought was supported by the ascertainment of the absence of <b>keloids</b> development in the palms and soles where sebaceous glands are absent. We focused on the investigation of the possibility of diminishing the sebum before the operation, since {{there is no way to}} avoid the trauma of sebaceous glands during the operation. We applied this method to 50 cases of postoperative <b>keloids</b> in conjunction with Laser dye 585 nm, since the focus of recent research has been on the improvement of <b>keloids</b> without deductive laser while effort has been made to further technological advancement resulting in more effective improvement of the lesions appearance. In our study we found a substantial decrease in recurrence rate of 22 % against the bibliography data, a fact that might imply a new intervention opportunity to the causative mechanism of <b>keloids</b> with so much simple preventive means in parallel with the combined use Laser. The efforts of treatment with laser CO 2, Argon laser and Nd: YAG laser did not attribute the expected clinical results. Laser, however, the selective photothermolysis and more specifically pulse dye laser 585 nm have been proved to lead to <b>keloids</b> improvement. In our own study, we examined the possibility treatments combinations and our therapeutic protocol of 50 cases included preoperating cleaning with αντισμηγματορροϊκά σκευάσματα and consequent application of pulse laser χρωστικής 585 nm. The results have been promising enough, since there has been found a decline in the recurrence rate amounting 22 %, and an additional decrease in the clinical and pathological improvement of the recurrences, accompanied with corresponding alleviation of patients in aesthetician and mainly in functional level because the removal of pain and hypersensitivity. In conclusion, the preventive cleaning with anti-sebum solutions before surgical excision, on the one side, and the application of pulse laser χρωστικής, on the other, very probably decrease the possibility of postoperative development of <b>keloids,</b> while the recurrence cases of these <b>keloids</b> presented important improvement rendering more favourable the forecast of <b>keloids,</b> while they signal also new prospects for further research in the confrontation of this difficult problem. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The surgery of <b>keloids</b> as an {{individual}} therapy with high rates of recurrence needs adjuvant therapies as complement. Recent <b>keloids</b> are rich in fibroblasts, which are highly radiosensitive and what explains the good results of percutaneous radiotherapy after surgery. Objective: To compare the beta-therapy results with electron-beam technique in newly operated <b>keloids.</b> Material and Methods: a prospective, comparative and randomized study was outlined including patients in the immediate postoperative period of surgical excision of <b>keloids.</b> Divided in G 1 and G 2 groups respectively, they received treatment with Sr 90 (beta-therapy) plates or with electrons from the linear accelerator.
