5|$|The Supermarionation puppets {{featured}} in Joe 90 {{are of the}} more accurately proportioned kind introduced for Captain Scarlet, and which would {{also be used for}} the Andersons' final puppet series, The Secret Service. Simultaneously, the drive for enhanced realism across all major design aspects which started with the preceding series continued <b>for</b> <b>Joe</b> 90. Main character puppets from Captain Scarlet were re-used <b>for</b> <b>Joe</b> 90 with the exceptions of the Captain Scarlet and Captain Blue marionettes. Few new puppets were constructed, the only notable exceptions being Professor McClaine (sculpted by Mary Turner), Joe (sculpted by Tim Cooksey), and Mrs Harris.|$|E

In September, location shooting in Albufeira, Portugal was accelerated for completion {{in two weeks}} {{as opposed to a}} month after politician Marcello Caetano deposed incapacitated Prime Minister Antonio Salazar, Parrish fearing that the coup d'état would cause the production of Doppelgänger to fall behind schedule. Filming in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire used the exterior of Neptune House (now part of the BBC's Elstree Studios) as a double for EUROSEC Headquarters in Portugal.

5|$|Slammiversary {{is remembered}} <b>for</b> <b>Joe</b> {{being the first}} to retain a {{championship}} in a King of the Mountain match. 20,000 was the reported figure of purchasers for the event by The Wrestling Observer Newsletter.

As the referee waited for Liger to submit, he became limp, causing the referee to lift and drop Liger's arm three times, resulting in the knock-out victory <b>for</b> <b>Joe.</b>|$|E
5|$|The role of Johnny {{was written}} by Jarmusch {{specifically}} <b>for</b> <b>Joe</b> Strummer, {{who had been the}} frontman of The Clash, the director's favorite 1980s rock band. Jarmusch had conceived the part a few years previously while the two were together in Spain, and although the musician had been in a period of depression at the time following the collapse of the band, he was drawn by the Memphis setting of the film. Unlike the jovial Steve Buscemi, Strummer did not stay on set to joke with the veteran actors between shots, but instead preferred to keep his own company, focusing intensively on orienting himself to the role.|$|E

5|$|After {{only six}} games in Milwaukee, McGrattan was traded {{back to the}} Flames, in {{exchange}} <b>for</b> <b>Joe</b> Piskula, on February 28, 2013. McGrattan's positive influence {{in the locker room}} as a player always prepared to play was cited as a reason why Calgary re-acquired him. The Flames also expected he would add a physical presence to the team, which he did in his re-debut with the Flames, a 4–2 victory over Vancouver that included several hits and a fight with Tom Sestito – his first NHL fight in over a year. He gave the crowd a salute following the fight, sending the fans into a frenzy and earning a ten-minute misconduct.

Despite his limited schedule he finished 27th with 242 points, the highest-ranked driver with less than ten starts. Gibbs tapped Hornish to drive the Auto Club 400 at Auto Club Speedway in the No. 11 Camry when regular driver Denny Hamlin was sidelined by a severe sinus infection, and he finished 17th.|$|E
5|$|McDowall fined Revie £27 {{for missing}} {{two weeks of}} {{training}} for a family holiday in Blackpool, which infuriated him as he had already won permission from trainer Laurie Barnett and had promised to train whilst on holiday. McDowall dropped Revie {{for much of the}} 1955–56 season, preferring instead to play Bobby Johnstone. Revie played only one FA Cup match that season before being named in the team for the 1956 FA Cup Final against Birmingham City, with Johnstone being moved to the wings. He provided the assist <b>for</b> <b>Joe</b> Hayes's opening goal, and instructed Ken Barnes to deviate from the manager's instructions at half-time, with the result being a more dominant second half display and a 3–1 victory; Revie was named as Man of the Match. However the rift with his manager was not forgotten, and he was moved to right-half in the 1956–57 campaign, leaving him to seek a move away from Maine Road.|$|E
5|$|Neilson {{signed a}} three-year deal with League Two side Bradford City in August 2009, {{and was given}} {{a place on the}} substitutes' bench for the club's next game with Torquay United, which Bradford won 2–0 with Neilson coming on <b>for</b> <b>Joe</b> Colbeck. Colbeck was sold three days later and so Neilson made his full debut in a Football League Trophy game with Rochdale. Neilson capped his debut with the winning goal in a 2–1 victory to send City through to the second round {{for the first time in}} four years. At the end of his full first full month with the club, Neilson scored his first league goal in {{professional}} football during a 3–0 win against Chesterfield, which helped to extend Bradford's unbeaten run to seven games. The club's form did not last and following a run of poor results, manager Stuart McCall left in February 2010 to be replaced by Peter Taylor. Neilson played in Taylor's first game in charge as City lost 2–0 to Accrington Stanley.|$|E
