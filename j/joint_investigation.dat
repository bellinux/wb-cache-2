5|$|Argentina {{suffered}} {{a terrorist attack}} in 1994, the AMIA bombing targeting a Buenos Aires Jewish center, that killed 85 people and wounded 300. The investigation remained open for years, and prosecutor Alberto Nisman {{was appointed to the}} case. He accused Iran of organizing the attack, and the Hezbollah group of carrying it out. He intended to prosecute five Iranian officials, including former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, but Argentina signed a memorandum of understanding with Iran for a <b>joint</b> <b>investigation.</b> Nisman accused the president of signing that memorandum for oil and trade benefits, according to hundreds of hours of wiretaps. On 19 January 2015 he was found dead at his home, a day before a congressional hearing to explain his accusation, which caused a great controversy. As of 2016, both the cases of the AMIA bombing and the death of Nisman remain unresolved, and the courts declined at the time to investigate his denunciation of Kirchner.|$|E
5|$|On 16 August 2007, {{acting on}} a suo motu notice, the Supreme Court of Pakistan took up the extrajudicial killings {{of the people at}} the Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa complex. Performance of the Islamabad {{administration}} attracted the reprimand of the court for its slow pace. The court was informed that 61 students were in custody, of whom 39 were on bailable offences. The Chief Justice of Pakistan ordered immediate release of 20 people considered innocent, as recommended by a <b>joint</b> <b>investigation</b> team. National Crisis Management Cell Director Javed Iqbal Cheema told the court that 28 DNA tests had not been confirmed.

5|$|Malaysia {{established}} the <b>Joint</b> <b>Investigation</b> Team (JIT) {{to investigate the}} incident, working with foreign aviation authorities and experts. Malaysia has stated that a final report on Flight 370 will be released {{by the end of}} 2017. Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished. Two passengers travelling on stolen passports were investigated, but eliminated as suspects. Malaysian police have identified the captain as the prime suspect if human intervention was the cause of the disappearance, after clearing all others on the flight of suspicious motives. Power was lost to the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) at some point between 01:07 and 02:03; the SDU logged onto Inmarsat's satellite communication network at 02:25—three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar. Based on analysis of the satellite communications, the aircraft turned south after passing north of Sumatra and the flight continued for six hours with little deviation in its track, ending when its fuel was exhausted.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Our study {{examines}} {{the frequency of}} <b>joint</b> <b>investigations</b> by child protection workers and the police in sexual abuse investigations compared to other maltreatment types and the association of child-, caregiver-, maltreatment- and investigation-related characteristics in <b>joint</b> <b>investigations,</b> focussing specifically on investigations involving sexual abuse. Methods: We analyzed data from the Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect- 2008 using logistic regression. Results: The data suggest that sexual abuse (55 %), and then physical abuse, neglect and emotional maltreatment, are most often co-investigated. Substantiation of maltreatment, severity of maltreatment, placement in out-of-home care, child welfare court involvement and referral of a family member to specialized services was more likely when the police were involved in an investigation. Conclusion: This study adds to the limited information on correlates of joint child protection agency and police investigations. Further {{research is needed to}} determine the effectiveness of these <b>joint</b> <b>investigations...</b>|$|R

The department employs detectives within its ranks, who are responsible for conducting most criminal investigations; however, whenever a major felony occurs in the village, such as a homicide or other criminal case that may involve other jurisdictions, the Broward Sheriff's Office is called in for assistance to pursue a <b>joint</b> <b>investigation</b> with a team approach.|$|E
25|$|This {{mission is}} a {{scheduled}} Flagship Program mission, {{and supported by}} the new Ocean Worlds Exploration Program. Europa Clipper will perform follow-up studies made by the Galileo spacecraft during its eight years in Jupiter orbit, which indicated the existence of a subsurface ocean underneath Europa. Plans to send a spacecraft to Europa were initially conceived with projects such as Europa Orbiter and Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter, in which a spacecraft would be injected into orbit around Europa. However, due to the strong impact of radiation from Jupiter's magnetosphere in Europan orbit, it was decided that it would be safer to inject a spacecraft into an elliptical orbit around Jupiter and make 45 close flybys of the moon instead. The mission began as a <b>joint</b> <b>investigation</b> between the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Applied Physics Laboratory.|$|E
25|$|The {{president}} changed Argentina's {{position on}} {{conflicts in the}} Middle East. During Macri's first week in office he voided the memorandum of understanding between Argentina and Iran which would have established a <b>joint</b> <b>investigation</b> of the 1994 AMIA bombing, a terrorist attack on a Jewish organization for which Argentina has blamed Hezbollah and Iran. The memorandum had been ruled unconstitutional by the judiciary, a ruling which was appealed during Kirchner's presidency. Macri withdrew the appeal, upholding the original ruling. He distanced himself from Iran and encouraged continued investigations of the AMIA bombing {{and the death of}} Alberto Nisman, a prosecutor investigating the case. Those cases and Nisman's probe of Kirchner have special importance for Argentina–Israel relations, and ambassador Carlos Faustino García and Israeli diplomat Modi Efraim praised Macri for encouraging the investigations. In July 2016, it was announced that Argentina would grant asylum to 3,000 refugees of the Syrian Civil War.|$|E
