40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a novel method for improving earthwork construction processes by coupling microscopic process simulation and macroscopic optimization approaches. It is designed as an iterative process where simulation and optimization procedures alternate {{with one another}} and exchange data with each other. The optimization module determines the optimal allocation of earthwork masses from cut to <b>fill</b> <b>areas,</b> in the first cycle with respect to distances and later in terms of haulage time. The generated output is used in the simulation module for routing the transport vehicles accordingly. Subsequently, the process time is determined in the simulation procedure by including diverse microscopic conditions. The resulting process time on each route is then used in the next optimization step as input for optimizing the earthwork allocations. The coupling cycle is repeated iteratively until the total earthwork process time converges. Initial tests based on input data of real high-way construction projects record a significant reduction in the total earthwork process time. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{procedure}} of manually generating a 3 D model {{of an object}} is very time consuming for a human operator. Next-best-view (NBV) planning is an important aspect for automation of this procedure in a robotic environment. We propose a surface-based NBV approach, which creates a triangle surface from a real-time data stream and determines viewpoints similar to human intuition. Thereby, the boundaries in the surface are detected and a quadratic patch for each boundary is estimated. Then several viewpoint candidates are calculated, which look perpendicular {{to the surface and}} overlap with previous sensor data. A NBV is selected with the goal to <b>fill</b> <b>areas</b> which are occluded. This approach focuses on the completion of a 3 D model of an unknown object. Thereby, the search pace for the viewpoints is not restricted to a cylinder or sphere. Our NBV determination proves to be very fast, and is evaluated in an experiment on test objects, applying an industrial robot and a laser range scanner...|$|E

40|$|There are {{few studies}} {{conducted}} on the short-term effects of land leveling on soil water holding capacity. The objectives {{of this study were}} to analyze the short-term effects of land leveling on the magnitudes, variances, spatial variability, and distributions of surface (0 – 20 [*]cm) and subsurface (20 – 40 [*]cm) soil properties of bulk density, field capacity, permanent wilting point, water holding capacity and particle size fractions. The study was conducted in a 1. 2 [*]ha field with clay loam soil located on the low terraces of Yesilirmak River, Tokat, Turkey. According to the paired t-test results, water holding capacity, and bulk density significantly increased, while permanent wilting point (P ≤  0. 001) and field capacity (P ≤  0. 05) significantly decreased for surface soil due to land leveling.

40|$|In this study, Geographical Information System (GIS) {{technique}} {{is used for}} estimating the excess cut and fill volumes stemmed from cut and fill heights continued uniformly to the midway of grid(or square) edges in the multiplication (rough) method. Twenty projects were selected randomly from the projects applied to the field before to test this calculation procedure. Grid dimension of all projects {{used in this study}} is originally 20 x 20 m. In order to apply the proposed technique, the new grid cells with a dimension of 1 x 1 m were created, and then the intersection lines of the plane of best-fit (or levelling plane) and original land surface were determined by linear interpolation. In the case of a grid dimension with 20 x 20 m, the boundary of cut and <b>fill</b> <b>areas</b> passes from the midpoint of square edges. Afterwards, cut and fill volumes were calculated by these two different grid dimensions. The differences of the cut volumes with a dimension of 1 x 1 m and 20 x 20 m is non significant at the probability of 1 %. The same result was estimated at the differences of fill volumes.

In addition, we used an automatic power injector with different injection delays to inject CM during the scans. A decrease in filling times caused by a lag in CM arrival during the scan resulted in a decrease in pixel values, distortion of the <b>filling</b> <b>area,</b> and appearance of streak artifacts. Even a delay of approximately 20  % in CM arrival in the total scan time resulted in obvious distortion of the <b>filling</b> <b>area.</b> The distortion and streak artifacts tended to worsen at higher CM concentrations.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the percentage of voids, gutta-percha and root canal sealer using 4 different filling techniques. Fifty-two extracted maxillary lateral incisors were prepared using the crown-down pressureless technique. The teeth were randomly divided in 4 groups (n= 13) : Lateral compaction (LC), Tagger's hybrid (TH), MicroSeal (MS) and GuttaFlow (GF) techniques. Horizontal cross-sections were made at the 2, 10 and 15 mm levels from the apex. Digital images of the root canal areas were acquired using a stereomicroscope and examined using the Image Tool 3. 0 software. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test (&# 945;= 0. 05). In general, a significant decrease in the gutta-percha <b>filled</b> <b>area</b> and increase of sealer area were observed at the apical level for all the evaluated techniques (p< 0. 05).

40|$|An {{increase}} {{in the rate of}} sea level rise is one of the primary impacts of projected global climate change. To assess potential inundation associated with a continued acceleration of sea level rise, the highest resolution elevation data available were assembled from various sources and mosaicked to cover the land surfaces of the San Francisco Bay region. Next, to quantify extreme water levels throughout the bay, a hydrodynamic model of the San Francisco Estuary was driven by a projection of hourly water levels at the Presidio. This projection was based on a combination of climate model outputs, an empirical model, and observations, and incorporates astronomical, storm surge, El Niño, and long-term sea level rise influences. Based on the resulting data, maps of areas vulnerable to inundation were produced, corresponding to specific amounts of sea level rise and recurrence intervals, including tidal datums. These maps portray areas where inundation will likely be an increasing concern. In the North Bay, wetlands and some developed <b>fill</b> <b>areas</b> are at risk. In Central and South bays, a key feature is the landward periphery of developed areas that would be newly vulnerable to inundation. Nearly all municipalities adjacent to South Bay face this risk to some degree. For the bay as a whole, as early as mid-century under this scenario, the one-year peak event nearly equals the 100 -year peak event in 2000. Maps of vulnerable areas are presented and some implications discussed. Results are available for interactive viewing and download at [URL]...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn Egypt {{and many}} {{developing}} countries, {{the use of}} Construction & Demolition (C&D) waste and Recycled Clay Masonry (RCM) brick materials as Unbound Granular Materials (UGMs) in pavement construction is generally very limited. There has been reluctance to adopt recycled materials in pavement construction.

This causes environmental problems and affects the daily lives of people. Therefore, blends of C&D waste materials with RCM were evaluated for use as UGMs. The C&D waste and RCM materials were obtained from some dumps on the sides of roads and canals around Mansoura City, Egypt. The collected materials were crushed and mixed in the laboratory. The proportions of the C&D/RCM blends were 100 / 0, 90 / 10, 80 / 20, 70 / 30, 55 / 45, 40 / 60, 20 / 80, and 0 / 100 % of the total aggregate mass. The characterization of C&D/RCM blends as well as the response to cyclic loading by Repeated Load Triaxial Testing (RLTT) was covered in this research paper. Static triaxial shear tests and RLTT were conducted using a Universal Testing Machine. RLTT and static triaxial shear test specimens were prepared at the optimum moisture content and compacted according to modified Proctor. RLTT were performed in accordance with the AASHTO T 307 on triplicate specimens. RCM materials (100 %) as UGMs failed to meet the requirements of Los Angeles Abrasion (LAA) test of 50 % maximum as specified by the Egyptian Code of Practice (ECP). RLTT data showed that all C&D/RCM blends yielded high resilient moduli however, no significant variation in resilient moduli values were observed between the different C&D/RCM blends...|$|E
