25|$|Böhm-Bawerk's theory equates capital {{intensity}} with {{the degree of}} roundaboutness of production processes. Böhm-Bawerk also argued that the law of marginal utility necessarily implies the classical law of costs. Some Austrian economists therefore entirely reject the notion that <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> affected by liquidity preference.|$|E
25|$|When {{modelling}} a bond option, {{or other}} interest rate derivative (IRD), {{it is important}} to recognize that future <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> uncertain, and therefore, the discount rate(s) referred to above, under all three cases—i.e. whether for all coupons or for each individual coupon—is not adequately represented by a fixed (deterministic) number. In such cases, stochastic calculus is employed.|$|E
50|$|Looking {{back into}} the past, the ex post real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>is</b> {{approximately}} the historical nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> minus inflation.

5000|$|If a bank were {{to raise}} the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> on a savings account from 3% to 4%, the {{statement}} that [...] "the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>was</b> increased by 1%" [...] is ambiguous and should be avoided.

50|$|Economists {{generally}} {{thought that}} <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>were</b> correlated to {{the rate of}} inflation, whereas Keynes' findings contradicted this view. During the period of gold standard, he concluded that <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>were</b> correlated to the general price level, and not {{the rate of change}} in the prices. In fact, he thought that <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>were</b> highly correlated to the wholesale price index rather than the rate of inflation.|$|R
25|$|In January 2005, the Dollar Bank CD Ladder was {{launched}} {{as the first}} CD of its kind. Laddering {{is based upon the}} premise of not putting all money in a single CD. By dividing money between CD terms ranging from short to long, CDs with a range of yields that reflect market expectations for the future direction of <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> purchased.|$|E
25|$|Official {{development}} assistance (ODA) {{is a term}} coined by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to measure aid. ODA refers to aid from national governments for promoting economic development and welfare in low and middle income countries. ODA can be bilateral or multilateral. This aid is given as either grants, where no repayment is required, or as concessional loans, where <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> lower than market rates.|$|E
25|$|Some {{bonds are}} callable, meaning {{that even though}} the company has agreed to make {{payments}} plus interest towards the debt for a certain period of time, the company can choose to pay off the bond early. This creates reinvestment risk, meaning the investor is forced to find a new place for their money, and the investor {{might not be able to}} find as good a deal, especially because this usually happens when <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> falling.|$|E
30|$|An {{important}} {{theory of}} the relationship between inflation <b>rate</b> and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>is</b> the Fisher effect; sometimes referred to as the Fisher hypothesis by Irvin Fisher. Fisher proved mathematically that the nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>is</b> equal to the real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> minus the expected (predicted) inflation rate. The Fisher effect simply explains for example that; if the nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>is</b> say 50 per cent for a given period, and the predicted inflation rate during that same period is 20 per cent, then the real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>is</b> 30 per cent. The movement in short term <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> primarily reflects fluctuation in expected inflation, which in effect has a predictive ability for future inflation (Mishkin and Simon 1995).|$|R
50|$|CD <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> closely track inflation. For example, in one {{situation}} <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> may <b>be</b> 15% {{and inflation}} may be 15%, {{and in another}} situation <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> may <b>be</b> 2% and inflation may be 2%. Of course, these factors cancel out, so the real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>is</b> the same in both cases.|$|R
50|$|Prince Edward Island {{has imposed}} {{a limit of}} fees charged on loans to $25 per $100 {{borrowed}} {{for a period of}} two weeks. The effective annual <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>is</b> 33,519%((1.25^(365/14)-1)*100), while the equivalent annual simple <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>is</b> 652% ((0.25*(365/14))*100).|$|R
25|$|In addition, the IMF negotiates {{conditions}} on lending and loans under their policy of conditionality, {{which was established}} in the 1950s. Low-income countries can borrow on concessional terms, which means there is a period of time with no interest rates, through the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), the Standby Credit Facility (SCF) and the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF). Nonconcessional loans, which include <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>are</b> provided mainly through Stand-By Arrangements (SBA), the Flexible Credit Line (FCL), the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), and the Extended Fund Facility. The IMF provides emergency assistance via the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to members facing urgent balance-of-payments needs.|$|E
25|$|Another {{explanation}} is that longer maturities entail greater risks for the investor (i.e. the lender). A risk premium is needed by the market, since at longer durations there is more uncertainty and a greater chance of catastrophic events that impact the investment. This explanation depends {{on the notion that}} the economy faces more uncertainties in the distant future than in the near term. This effect {{is referred to as the}} liquidity spread. If the market expects more volatility in the future, even if <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> anticipated to decline, the increase in the risk premium can influence the spread and cause an increasing yield.|$|E
25|$|Two caveats {{are added}} to this criticism. Firstly, if savings are held as cash, rather than being loaned out (directly by savers, or indirectly, as via bank deposits), then loanable funds do not increase, and thus a {{recession}} may be caused – but {{this is due to}} holding cash, not to saving per se. Secondly, banks themselves may hold cash, rather than loaning it out, which results in the growth of excess reserves – funds on deposit but not loaned out. This is argued to occur in liquidity trap situations, when <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> at a zero lower bound (or near it) and savings still exceed investment demand. Within Keynesian economics, the desire to hold currency rather than loan it out is discussed under liquidity preference.|$|E
5000|$|The real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>is</b> the <b>rate</b> of <b>interest</b> an investor, saver or lender {{receives}} (or {{expects to}} receive) after allowing for inflation.

5000|$|... is {{the annual}} {{effective}} <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> which <b>is</b> the [...] "true" [...] <b>rate</b> of <b>interest</b> over a year. Thus if the annual <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>is</b> 12% then [...]|$|R
25|$|Compound {{interest}} may be {{contrasted with}} simple interest, where interest is not {{added to the}} principal, {{so there is no}} compounding. The simple annual <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>is</b> the <b>interest</b> amount per period, multiplied by the number of periods per year. The simple annual <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>is</b> also known as the nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> (not to <b>be</b> confused with the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> not adjusted for inflation, which goes by the same name).|$|R
25|$|Lending {{criteria}} {{have been}} tightened following {{the passing of}} Money Laundry Law 80 in 2002 and Banking Law 88 in 2003. <b>Interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> no longer the dominant factor in banks' lending decisions. In fact, both the inefficiency and absence {{of the role of}} the Central Bank of Egypt in qualitative and quantitative control as well as implementing banking procedures and standards was almost entirely responsible for the non-performing loans crisis. Banks steadily reduced credit from its peak of about EGP 30 billion in FY1999 and alternatively invested in more liquid no-risk securities such as treasury bills and government bonds. Improving private sector access to credit will critically depend on resolving the problem of non-performing loans with businesses and top government officials.|$|E
25|$|As a researcher, Summers {{has made}} {{important}} contributions {{in many areas}} of economics, primarily public finance, labor economics, financial economics, and macroeconomics. Summers has also worked in international economics, economic demography, economic history and development economics. His work generally emphasizes the analysis of empirical economic data in order to answer well-defined questions (for example: Does saving respond to after-tax <b>interest</b> <b>rates?</b> <b>Are</b> the returns from stocks and stock portfolios predictable? Are most of those who receive unemployment benefits only transitorily unemployed? etc.) For his work, he received the John Bates Clark Medal in 1993 from the American Economic Association. In 1987, he was the first social scientist to win the Alan T. Waterman Award from the National Science Foundation. Summers {{is also a member of}} the National Academy of Sciences.|$|E
25|$|As {{one of the}} world's leading {{international}} financial centres, Hong Kong's service-oriented economy is characterized by its low taxation, almost free port trade and well established {{international financial}} market. Its currency, called the Hong Kong dollar, is legally issued by three major international commercial banks, and pegged to the US dollar. <b>Interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> determined by the individual banks in Hong Kong to ensure it is fully market-driven. There is no officially recognised central banking system, although Hong Kong Monetary Authority functions as a financial regulatory authority. When destabilising factors are hitting the financial market of Hong Kong, they will be monitored and inspected by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the financial regulatory agency in Hong Kong. Electronic finance trading is evolutionarily impacting the financial market of Hong Kong.|$|E
50|$|In this analysis, {{the nominal}} <b>rate</b> <b>is</b> the stated <b>rate,</b> {{and the real}} <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>is</b> the <b>interest</b> after the {{expected}} losses due to inflation. Since the future inflation <b>rate</b> can only <b>be</b> estimated, the ex ante and ex post (before and after the fact) real <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> may <b>be</b> different; the premium paid to actual inflation may be higher or lower. In contrast, the nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>is</b> always known in advance.|$|R
5000|$|Ontario {{enacted the}} Payday Loans Act, 2008 [...] {{to limit the}} fees charged on loans in Ontario to $21 per $100 {{borrowed}} {{for a period of}} two weeks.

50|$|Similarly an <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> floor <b>is</b> a {{derivative}} contract {{in which the}} buyer receives payments {{at the end of}} each period in which the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>is</b> below the agreed strike price.|$|R
25|$|The main number {{which is}} used to assess the value of the bond is the gross {{redemption}} yield. This is defined such that if all future interest and principal repayments are discounted back to the present, at an interest rate equal to the gross redemption yield (gross means pre-tax), then the discounted value is equal to the current market price of the bond (or the initial issue price if the bond is just being launched). Fixed income investments such as bonds and loans are generally priced as a credit spread above a low-risk reference rate, such as LIBOR or U.S. or German Government Bonds of the same duration. For example, if a 30-year mortgage denominated in US dollars has a gross redemption yield of 5% per annum and 30 year US Treasury Bonds have a gross redemption yield of 3% per annum (referred to as the risk free yield), the credit spread is 2% per annum (sometimes quoted as 200 basis points). The credit spread reflects the risk of default. Risk free <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> determined by market forces and vary over time, based on a variety of factors, such as current short-term interest rates, e.g. base rates set by central banks such as the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England in the UK, and the Euro Zone ECB. If the coupon on the bond is lower than the yield, then its price will be below the par value, and vice versa.|$|E
500|$|The {{announced}} nationalisation of Glitnir {{came just}} as the United Kingdom government was forced to nationalise Bradford & Bingley and to sell its retail operations and branch network to Grupo Santander. Over the weekend of 4–5 October, British newspapers carried many articles detailing the nationalisation of Glitnir and the high leverage of Iceland's other banks. Influential BBC business editor Robert Peston published an opinion piece on the banks, stating that debt insurance for Kaupthing required a premium of £625,000 to guarantee the return of £1 million: [...] "the worst case of financial BO I've encountered in some time" [...] was his graphic description. The Guardian said [...] "Iceland is {{on the brink of}} collapse. Inflation and <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> raging upwards. The krona, Iceland's currency, is in freefall." [...] These articles spooked investors discussing Icesave (the brand name of Landsbanki in the UK and the Netherlands) in online forums and many started moving their savings out of the Internet bank. Problems with access to the site hinted at a run on savings.|$|E
500|$|Keynes {{had begun}} a {{theoretical}} work {{to examine the}} relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s. The work, Treatise on Money, was published in 1930 in two volumes. A central idea of the work was that if the amount of money being saved exceeds the amount being invested – which can happen if <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> too high – then unemployment will rise. This is in part a result of people not wanting to spend too high a proportion of what employers pay out, making it difficult, in aggregate, for employers to make a profit. Another key theme of the book is the unreliability of financial indices for representing an accurate – or indeed meaningful – indication of general shifts in purchasing power of currencies over time. In particular he criticised the justification of Britain's return to the gold standard in 1925 at pre-war valuation by reference to the wholesale price index. He argued that the index understated the effects of changes in the costs of services and of labour. In 1927 he wrote, [...] "We will not have any more crashes in our time." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{continuous}} time {{models of the}} short-term <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>are</b> estimated using recently developed Gaussian estimation methods on four currencies <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Results indicate that for the US and Japanese currencies currently used models perform well in capturing the adjustment of the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> process.

30|$|Moreover, {{over the}} post-global {{recession}} period, the positive causal role of broad money growth on <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>is</b> re-established. Further, {{a significant impact}} of income growth is also found. Furthermore, a prominent role of exchange <b>rate</b> on <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>is</b> established where exchange rate depreciation in the flexible regime causes an increase in <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Therefore, the exchange <b>rate</b> affects <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> significantly when a flexible exchange <b>rate</b> system <b>is</b> introduced.|$|R
2500|$|Nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> {{normally}} positive, but not always. In contrast, {{real interest}} rates can be negative, when nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> below inflation. When {{this is done}} via government policy (for example, via reserve requirements), this is deemed financial repression, and was practiced by countries such as the United States and United Kingdom following [...] World War II (from 1945) until the late 1970s or early 1980s (during and following the Post–World War II economic expansion). In the late 1970s, United States Treasury securities with negative real interest rates were deemed certificates of confiscation.|$|E
2500|$|Rewards and risks: Sukuk can {{increase}} in value when the assets {{increase in value}}. Returns from bonds correspond to fixed interest. (Because most bonds' <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>are</b> fixed, most increase in value when the market interest rates fall.) ...|$|E
