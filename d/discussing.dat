5|$|Historians {{of science}} have noted that, while Darwin {{considered}} the ideas in Wallace's paper to be {{essentially the same}} as his own, there were differences. Darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce, whereas Wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions, leading populations in different locations to diverge. Some historians, notably Peter J. Bowler, have suggested the possibility that in the paper he mailed to Darwin, Wallace was not <b>discussing</b> selection of individual variations at all but rather group selection. However, Malcolm Kottler has shown that this notion is incorrect and Wallace was indeed <b>discussing</b> individual variations.|$|E
