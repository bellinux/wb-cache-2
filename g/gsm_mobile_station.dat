40|$|Introduction Upon {{power-on}} a <b>GSM</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> (MS) one of {{its first}} tasks is to locate and then synchronize itself to the carrier frequency of the local base station (BS). This is to ensure adequate reception and more importantly, {{to ensure that the}} MS transmitter's carrier frequency is within specifications. The next task is to determine the symbol timing of the received signal. This is necessary to properly demodulate the incoming bit stream and to ensure that the transmitter's symbol timing meets specifications. Thus, both frequency and timing synchronization must be achieved [1]. The frequency synchronization system must locate the broadcast control channel (BCCH) carrier signal, determine the starting point of the frequency correction burst (FCB), calculate the frequency o#set of the mobile unit's local reference oscillator relative to the BS carrier, and adjust the local reference oscillator frequency to reduce the frequency o#set to within specifications.

40|$|Today, {{e-commerce}} {{transactions are}} typically protected using SSL/TLS. However, {{there are risks}} in such use of SSL/TLS, notably threats arising {{from the fact that}} information is stored in clear at the end point of the communication link and the lack of user authentication. Although SSL/TLS does o#er the latter, it is optional and usually omitted since users typically do not have the necessary asymmetric key pair. In this paper, we propose a payment protocol in which user authentication is provided using GSM `subscriber identity authentication'. In the protocol, a consumer is required to possess a <b>GSM</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> registered under a subscriber name corresponding to that on his/her debit/credit card. The cardholder identity is combined with the GSM subscriber identity {{in such a way that}} without a mobile station, in particular the SIM, and the corresponding debit/credit card, an unscrupulous user will find it di#cult to make a fraudulent payment at the expense of the legitimate cardholder. This is achieved in such a way that no management overhead is imposed on the user...|$|E

40|$|Global System for <b>Mobile</b> Communications (<b>GSM)</b> {{supports}} full-rate and half-rate calls. In this paper, {{we propose}} analytical and simulation models {{to study the}} performance of four channel assignment schemes for GSM half-rate and full-rate traffic. Our study indicates that among the four schemes, the repacking scheme has the best performance for mixing half-rate and full-rate traffic. We also observe that good performance is expected if the standard derivation of the cell residence time for a <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> is large. 1 Introduction Global System for <b>Mobile</b> Communications (<b>GSM)</b> [12] is a standard adopted by cellular systems widely developed in Europe and Asia. In a <b>GSM</b> network, a <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> (MS) initiates a communication session by making an access request to a base station (BS) if the MS is in the cell (the radio coverage area) of the BS. If no channel is available at that cell, the call is blocked. If the MS moves to another cell during the conversation, then the radio 2 link to th [...] ...|$|R

30|$|Most {{commercial}} implementations of fingerprint-based outdoor GSM localization {{exploit the}} standard Network Measurement Reports, NMR, which, {{according to the}} <b>GSM</b> norm, the <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> transmits to its serving Base Transceiver Station (BTS) roughly twice per second during a communication. Each 7 -element NMR contains the RSS measurements of fixed-power beacon signals emanating from the serving BTS and its six strongest neighbors. In contrast, the frequency scans recorded by our TEMS and M 2 M modules are performed in idle mode, that is, when no call is in progress. Although NMRs are thus not available in our data, the scans nonetheless contain data on all channels, and include, at least in principle, the BSIC of each channel. This allows, for example, to 'construct' an NMR artificially, as {{was done in the}} definition of the Current Top 7 fingerprint in Section 2.2.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This article proposes {{several types}} of {{interference}} cancellation for the downlink connection in the <b>GSM</b> <b>mobile</b> communications system. The solutions are {{in the class of}} Dual Antenna Interference Cancellation (DAIC) which utilize two antennas in the <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> in order to improve the network performance in the link level. The performance of the receivers introduced here are compared with the conventional and the Single Antenna Interference Cancellation (SAIC). The results show that the DAIC receivers bring about substantial reduction in the bit-error-rate (BER) in the downlink connection.

50|$|Some {{preliminary}} {{research has}} been done in trying to detect and frustrate IMSI-catchers. One such project is through the Osmocom open source <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> software. This is a special type of mobile phone firmware {{that can be used to}} detect and fingerprint certain network characteristics of IMSI-catchers, and warn the user that there is such a device operating in their area. But this firmware/software-based detection is strongly limited to a select few, outdated <b>GSM</b> <b>mobile</b> phones (i.e. Motorola) that are no longer available on the open market. The main problem is the closed-source nature of the major mobile phone producers.|$|R
40|$|The precise {{position}} of the <b>mobile</b> <b>station</b> is critical for the ever increasing number of applications based on location. In this paper, we introduce a novel positioning technique for positioning a <b>GSM</b> <b>mobile</b> phone in real-time. This technique {{is based on the}} <b>GSM</b> <b>mobile</b> phone feature, that it can measure the signal strengths from a number of nearby base stations. In this approach we use the GSM signal strengths measured in real environment to train an artificial neural network. The neural network is trained using the second order learning algorithm (Extended Kalman Filter) because of its superiority in the learning speed and mapping accuracy. The mobile position can be determined with good accuracy by providing the current signal strength data to a previously trained neural network. The EKF shows its superiority to the Back Propagation (BP) in both the General Feed Forward (GFF) and the Multi Layer Perception (MLP) neural network architectures. The good accuracy of the calculated position with either an EKF training in a General Feed Forward (GFF) or a Multi Layer Perception (MLP) neural network is shown...|$|R
