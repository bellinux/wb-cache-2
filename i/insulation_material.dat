5|$|The fire {{may have}} been caused by the {{accidental}} ignition of polyurethane foam insulation used on the building's outer walls. In China, the foam is commonly used as <b>insulation</b> <b>material</b> without the addition of flame retardants, and the foam produces toxic gases and carbon monoxide when burned. The Beijing Television Cultural Center was said to have used polyurethane insulation, which magnified the ferocity of a 2009 fire that consumed the center. In a 24 November press conference, local authorities said that the two apartments next to the destroyed building would be renovated as well, and that foam cladding on their exteriors would be switched out in favor of fire-resistant materials. Chinese citizens have also questioned the lack of an indoor fire sprinkler system in high rise buildings.|$|E

25|$|The most {{fundamental}} difference {{lies in the}} choice of AC or DC. The earliest systems used DC, as AC was not well understood and <b>insulation</b> <b>material</b> for high voltage lines was not available. DC locomotives typically run at relatively low voltage (600 to 3,000 volts); the equipment is therefore relatively massive because the currents involved are large in order to transmit sufficient power. Power must be supplied at frequent intervals as the high currents result in large transmission system losses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> {{are among}} the {{simplest}} ways of decreasing heat loss in the buildings. When <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> are installed in the walls, floors and roof of a building to prevent heat loss from the building, materials must be used with the appropriate structural and thermal properties. In this paper, a laboratory test of the thermal conductivity and cell structure of building <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> was conducted. From the experiment results, the correlation expression between thermal conductivity and density was derived. In {{the case of the}} <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> that were made of expanded polypropylene (EPP), as the density increased, the thermal conductivity tended to decrease; {{and in the case of}} ethylene-vinyl acetate co-polymer (EVA) and polyethylene (PE), as the density of the <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> increased, the thermal conductivity tended to also increase...|$|R

This article {{put forward}} several {{suggestions}} {{for the design}} of new type of fire <b>insulation</b> <b>materials,</b> and cited several new types of fire protection materials; advocate the use of fire <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> to prevent fires from the material roots. Intorduction The external wall insulation system is a composite insulation decorate the outside of the wall structure, The material itself, the combustion performance and fire resistance is a key factor in the spread of resistance against the adjacent building fire and further spread of fire within buildings. When the fire broke out, If the wall <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> haven’t fire resistance, The flame will be passed upward propagation through the external thermal insulation system, Leading to the spread of fire. Therefore, if we want to fundamentally prevent tragedies from happening again, we must use the <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> of fire performance. Especially the last two years, Fires frequently occur, like CCTV fire, Shanghai Jiaozhou Road fire, it makes people to put forward higher requirements for the fire performance of external <b>insulation</b> <b>materials,</b> In this context, how to ensure that the building fire was not caused by <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> and how to ensure that the <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> do not contribute to flame spread and expansion when the fire broke out are worthy of the key research...|$|R

500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1958, Radio Luxembourg {{launched}} a challenge to transport three tons of ice from the Arctic Circle to the Equator. The radio station would award 100,000francs for each kilogram (at the time, US$202.55 per kilogram; $1,487.19 or €1,120.19 per kg in 2009 currency) that remained at the destination; the only condition was that no form of refrigeration should be used. Managing director Birger Natvik at the Norwegian <b>insulation</b> <b>material</b> company Glassvatt (today Glava AS) saw the announcement and suggested that the company take on the challenge. He estimated that by isolating the ice with glass wool ("glassvatt" [...] in Norwegian) made from fibreglass, the driver could make several million francs. Once Radio Luxembourg realised the potential loss, they retracted the offer. By this point, however, the planned expedition had received so much attention that Glassvatt decided {{to go through with}} it anyway. Among the other sponsors were Shell, who provided the fuel, and Scania, who provided the truck. Altogether, sponsors from eight countries financed the expedition, including Glassvatt's French mother company, the Saint-Gobain corporation. The French sponsors wanted a French truck to be used, but the Norwegians insisted on a Scandinavian one. The latter position won through, and a Scania-Vabis was selected for the task. The expedition's leader later admitted that a French truck probably would have been more suitable for driving in the desert. On 22 February 1959, at 9:15 am, the expedition left Mo i Rana.|$|E

30|$|Insulation or thermal {{insulation}} {{is the process}} of reducing or increasing heat transfer between two or more objects that are in the range of thermal contact or relative influence.

Materials that provide superior insulation especially in industrial applications are known as high-performance <b>insulation</b> <b>materials.</b> Some of the key attributes of high-performance <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> are superior heat regulation without having a support of air conditioning machine or heater, prevention from moisture damage, and an optimum in-house atmosphere.

40|$|In today’s society {{there is}} an {{increased}} focus on various energy aspects. Buildings constitute {{a large part of}} the total energy consumption in the world. In this respect it is important to have the optimum heat balance in buildings. That is, in a cold climate one wants to have as well thermally insulated building envelopes as possible. However, even in cold climates there might often be relatively long periods of overheating in the buildings, for example, due to solar heat gains and excessive heat loads from miscellaneous indoor activities. In warm climates overheating is most often the case, for example, in office work spaces with large window glass facades and extensive use of electrical equipment. Insulation retrofit is among the most cost-effective measures, even more cost-effective than, for example, solar photovoltaics. The traditional thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> of today have typically thermal conductivities between 33 and 40 mW/(mK). State-of-the-art thermal insulation includes vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) with conductivities between 3 and 4 mW/(mK) in fresh condition to typically 8 mW/(mK) after 25 years aging due to water vapor and air diffusion into the VIP core material, which has an open pore structure. Puncturing the VIP envelope causes an increase in the thermal conductivity to about 20 mW/(mK). The main emphasis of this work centers around the possibilities of inventing and developing innovative and robust highly thermal insulating materials. That is, within this work the objective is to go beyond VIPs and other current state-of-the-art technologies.
