The application of the instrument to obtain size distributions throughout {{a wide range of}} particle sizes for transient systems, such as motor vehicle emissions, has been limited by the time resolution of the SMPS. In this paper, we present a fast-SMPS (f-SMPS) that utilizes a Radial Differen-tial Mobility Analyzer (rDMA) and a Mixing Condensation Par-ticle Counter (mCPC).

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{is one of}} the key factors affecting energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. By focusing on China’s transport sector, this study comprehensively reviews and compares the energy efficiency performance of passenger vehicles, light-duty commercial vehicles, commercial road transport, commercial water transport, aviation transport and railway transport, and identifies the opportunities for further energy efficiency improvements. It is found that railway transport exhibited the greatest improvement in energy efficiency during the past decade, which was mainly driven by progress in its electrification. Passenger vehicles have also experienced considerable energy efficiency improvements, which can be mainly attributed to the establishment of mandatory fuel consumption standards. In contrast, commercial road transport has shown the least improvement, due to insufficient policy implementations. Based on the analysis, it is recommended that, as China’s present policy framework to improve energy efficiency in the transport sector is generally effective, it should be consistently maintained and successively improved. Electrification represents a major opportunity for improvement of energy efficiency in the transport sector. Such potential should be fully tapped for all transport modes. Greater effort should be put into improving the energy efficiency of commercial road transport.

40|$|It {{is often}} {{asserted}} that consumers purchasing automobiles or other {{goods and services}} underweight the costs of gasoline or other "add-ons. " We test this hypothesis in the US automobile market by examining the effects of time series variation in gasoline price expectations on the prices and market shares of vehicles with different fuel economy ratings. When gas prices rise, demand for high fuel economy vehicles increases, pushing up their relative prices. Market share changes - increased production of high fuel economy vehicles and scrappage of low fuel economy vehicles - attenuate these price changes. Intuitively, the less that equilibrium vehicle prices and shares respond to changes in expected gasoline prices, the less that consumers appear to value gasoline costs. We estimate a nested logit discrete choice model using a remarkable dataset that includes market shares, characteristics, expected usage, and transaction price microdata for all new and used vehicles available between 1999 and 2008. To address simultaneity bias, we introduce a new <b>instrument</b> <b>for</b> used <b>vehicle</b> market shares, {{based on the fact}} that gasoline prices cause variation in new vehicle shares that then persists over time as the vehicles move through resale markets. Our results show that US auto consumers are willing to pay just $ 0. 61 to reduce expected discounted gas expenditures by $ 1. We incorporate the estimated parameters into a new discrete choice approach to behavioral welfare analysis, which suggests with caution that a paternalistic energy efficiency policy could generate welfare gains of $ 3. 6 billion per year.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} {{the theory and}} simulation results of a GPS-based Azimuth/Gradient determination <b>instrument</b> <b>for</b> a land <b>vehicle,</b> using two GPS receivers to realize interferometry. Our purpose is to design a system, which is both robust and accurate. A simulation system is designed and developed to simulate the GPS constellation, the required carrier phase observation and ephemeris, {{the dynamics of the}} land vehicle and the signal processing for Azimuth / Gradient determination. This system uses the interferometric processing of the GPS L 1 signals to determine the Azimuth / Gradient using Euler angle rotations. On the basis of the carrier phase observation model, the non-linear equation is solved iteratively. After coordinate system transformation, the Azimuth / Gradient are computed in body frame. Utilizing the proper maneuver of the vehicle, the integer ambiguity is resolved by an instantaneous method, i. e. solution for the GPS integrated carrier Doppler wavelength ambiguities (integer ambiguity) doesn’t depend on the observations over a long time. In this way, further improvement in the robustness of the realization is achieved because the system could be quickly reset and initialized at any time. This instantaneous property, together with the cycle slip detection routine, renders the system resistant to cycle slip. Results are presented using simulated GPS L 1 signal with the effects of multi-path, ionosphere, troposphere and receiver electronic noise, proving its accuracy and stability...|$|R
40|$|Particulate {{emissions}} cause {{adverse health}} effects {{and for this reason}} they are regulated since the 80 s. Vehicle regulations cover particulate emission measurements of a model before its sale, known as type approval or homologation. For heavy-duty engines the emissions are measured on an engine dynamometer with steady state points and transient cycles. <b>For</b> light-duty <b>vehicles</b> (i. e. the full power train) the particulate emissions are assessed on a chassis dynamometer. The measurement of particulate emissions is conducted either by diluting the whole exhaust in a dilution tunnel with constant volume sampling or by extracting a small proportional part of the exhaust gas and diluting it. Particulate emissions are measured by passing part of the diluted exhaust aerosol through a filter paper. The increase of the weight of the filter is used to calculate the particulate matter mass (PM) emissions. Vehicles are also checked during the course of their lives, i. e. those pulled over by authorities for roadside checks or the mandatory periodic inspection in a garage. In this case smoke is assessed with free acceleration tests. However, all these tests do not give any relevant information about the emissions of the vehicles during real driving conditions. This was only recently regulated. The particulate emissions on the road are measured with portable emission measurement systems (PEMS). The particulate emissions of newer vehicles decreased by more than two orders of magnitude since the 80 s. The particulate measurement methods reached their detection limit and for this reason the particle number (PN) concentration was introduced in the European Union legislation as a new metric. In this paper a short summary of the particulate emission legislation of vehicles over the years is given. Then the instrumentation that has been used and is currently being used, like gravimetric filter measurement, is explained. In addition, other popular methods and instruments are analyzed, like chemical analysis of filters, light extinction, scattering and absorption instruments, electrical mobility and particle counting instruments.
