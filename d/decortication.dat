40|$|AbstractIntroductionBilateral empyema is a {{rare and}} {{life-threatening}} condition {{that is difficult to}} treat. We herein report a case of bilateral empyema that was treated with simultaneous bilateral <b>decortications</b> via video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). Presentation of caseA 38 -year-old female complained of chest pain, dyspnea, and high grade fever lasting two weeks. Computed tomography revealed bilateral notching pleural effusion and pneumonia with atelectasis. Bilateral thoracic drainage was performed. From the right chest, white pus was drained, and Streptococcus anginosus was identified. The left drainage fluid was serous, and no bacteria were identified. We diagnosed the patient with right empyema and left para-pneumonic effusion consequent to pneumonia. Because conservative therapies could not resolve the inflammatory findings, simultaneous bilateral VATS <b>decortications</b> were performed. Both thoracic cavities had loculated pleural effusion. In contrast to the preoperative findings, white pus was found in not only the right, but also the left thoracic cavity. She had an uncomplicated postoperative course and recovered. DiscussionBilateral empyema that has developed to the fibrinopleural phase is difficult to treat with drains alone. Bilateral VATS <b>decortications</b> helped to make a definitive diagnosis and treat both sides simultaneously. ConclusionSimultaneous bilateral VATS <b>decortications</b> should be considered as a feasible and effective procedure for bilateral empyema that is refractory to medical treatment...|$|R
40|$|Jatropha fruit, {{presently}} dehulled manually in {{the absence}} of a suitable mechanical device. Manual <b>decortications</b> of Jatropha fruit for the purpose of extracting seeds is a time consuming and tedious operation. A small, continuous, hand-operated machine, specially designed and constructed for <b>decortications</b> of Jatropha fruits has been done and evaluated for performance parameters. The major components of the machine are the frame, hopper, decorticating chamber, concave sieve, rotating blades, discharge outlet and a vibrating separator with sieve to separate seed and shell. The performance parameters of the machine including Percentage of whole seed, broken seed, partially shelled fruit, unshelled fruit, machine efficiency and <b>decortications</b> efficiency, were evaluated at four different moisture content (7. 97 %, 10. 53 %, 13. 09 % and 15. 65 % d. b.) with a combinations of concave clearance (18 Â mm, 21 Â mm, 24 Â mm and 27 Â mm) between concave sieve and rotating blades. The best set of conditions under which the decorticator can be operated is at fruit moisture content of 7. 97 % d. b. with concave clearance of 21 Â mm between the concave and the blade at which the maximum whole seeds of 67. 94 % can be achieved and machine efficiency of 90. 96 % can be obtained. All materials used for fabricating the components were brought from sourced locally. This design is preferred, because of its rapid operation, low human-energy expenditure, low breakage factor for the seed as well as relatively little dust being emitted during shelling; hence leading to a relatively-healthier local atmosphere for the operator.

Furthermore, single-shock stimulation of the sciatic nerve also activated the medial reticular formation, hypothalamus, and thalamus. Excitation of the ARAS did not depend on further signal propagation through the cerebellar circuits, as the same results were obtained following decerebellation and <b>decortication.</b> The researchers proposed that a column of cells surrounding the midbrain reticular formation received input from all the ascending tracts of the brain stem and relayed these afferents to the cortex and therefore regulated wakefulness.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{the only}} clinical/pharmacological {{treatment}} available for ADPKD consists {{in reducing the}} speed in gain of total kidney volume (TKV) with aquaretics (i.e. tolvaptan), which can alleviate pain while giving the patients {{a better quality of}} life for over a mean of 3 years. After this period, patients can restart gaining TKV at pre-treatment rates and may eventually have to go through dialysis and kidney transplant. Paliative treatment modalities involve symptomatic medications (non-opioid and opioid analgesics) for abdominal/retroperitoneal pain. Before the advent of aquaretic medication, the only option for analgesic-resistant pain were simple or complex surgical procedures (i.e. renal cyst aspiration, cyst <b>decortication,</b> renal denervation and nephrectomy), which can result in complications inherent to surgery.|$|E
25|$|In {{cases of}} {{advanced}} oral ischaemic osteoporosis and/or ONJ {{that are not}} bisphosphonates related, clinical evidence has shown that surgically removing the damaged marrow, usually by curettage and <b>decortication,</b> will eliminate the problem (and the pain) in 74% of patients with jaw involvement. Repeat surgeries, usually smaller procedures than the first, may be required. Almost a third of jawbone patients will need surgery {{in one or more}} other parts of the jaws because the disease so frequently present multiple lesions, i.e., multiple sites in the same or similar bones, with normal marrow in between. In the hip, at least half of all patients will get the disease in the opposite hip over time; this pattern occurs in the jaws as well. Recently, it has been found that some osteonecrosis patients respond to anticoagulation therapies alone. The earlier the diagnosis the better the prognosis. Research is ongoing on other non-surgical therapeutic modalities that could alone or in combination with surgery further improve the prognosis and reduce the morbidity of ONJ. A greater emphasis on minimizing or correcting known causes is necessary while further research is conducted on chronic ischaemic bone diseases such as oral osteoporosis and ONJ.|$|E

40|$|There are no {{well-established}} indications for {{the surgical}} management of acute necrotizing pneumonitis in children. This study presents our experience regarding this challenging topic. Methods: Between 2002 and 2009, 56 necrotizing pneumonitis patients with empyema were treated surgically. The outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. Computed tomography findings of massive lung necrosis or large cavities involving more than 50 % of the involved lobe were {{deemed to be}} complicated necrotizing pneumonitis. Patients without the above indications were considered uncomplicated. Results: Thirty-one cases were uncomplicated and 25 were complicated. Operative procedures included 38 <b>decortications</b> (31 uncomplicated and seven complicated), 14 wedge resections, and four lobectomies (complicated only). Preoperatively, patients with complicated necrotizing pneumonia had {{a higher incidence of}} pneumothorax (32 % vs. 14. 3 %; p =  0. 001), endotracheal intubation (44 % vs. 9. 7 %; p =  0. 008), and hemolytic uremic syndrome (20 % vs. 3. 2 %; p =  0. 01). These patients also had higher incidences of intraoperative transfusion (68 % vs. 9. 7 %; p =  0. 03), major postoperative complications (16 % vs. 0 %; p =  0. 02), reoperations (16 % vs. 0 %; p =  0. 02), and longer postoperative stay (19. 8  ±  24. 2  days vs. 11. 2  ±  5. 8  days; p =  0. 03). Four complicated patients, who initially had <b>decortications</b> and limited resections, underwent reoperations. Compared with uncomplicated patients, those who underwent <b>decortications</b> and wedge resection required longer postoperative stays (23. 6  ±  9. 9  days, p <  0. 01 and 21. 1  ±  30. 7  days, p =  0. 04, respectively), whereas patients who had lobectomy had a similar duration of recovery (9. 0  ±  2. 1  days, p =  0. 23).

40|$|Background context: Periosteum, endosteum, {{and bone}} are innervated by sensory nerves expressing {{calcitonin}} gene-related peptide (CGRP), {{which is a}} known osteoanabolic peptide and {{plays an important role}} in fracture healing and spinal fusion. Synthesis and release of CGRP are found in sensory neurons located in the dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) and can be upregulated by electrical stimulation (ES) at DRG. Purpose: To prove our study hypothesis on the potential of precise ES at DRG through implantable microelectrical stimulation system (IMESS) for its effect on promoting spinal fusion in a rat model without <b>decortications</b> and bone grafting. Study design: An experimental animal study. Methods: A novel IMESS was developed for stimulating L 4 -L 6 DRG in rats. Sixteen rats were used and divided equally into the control group without ES and the ES group, with a daily 20 minutes ES to DRG for 6 weeks. At the end of 6 weeks, radiography and microcomputed tomography were conducted to evaluate new bone formation and spinal fusion. Bilateral L 4 -L 6 DRGs were harvested for immunohistochemistry and quantification of neurons with upregulated CGRP expression. Results: In the ES group, rate of radiographic fusion with complete and uninterrupted bony bridging was 100 % (8 / 8) at the right L 4 /L 5 transverse processes and 75 % (6 / 8) at the right L 5 /L 6 transverse processes. Bony callus formation was absent at the left L 4 -L 6 transverse processes in the ES group and in bilateral L 4 -L 6 transverse processes in the control group. Conclusions: We proved for the first time that precise ES at DRG through IMESS effectively promoted intertransverse process fusion in rat model without <b>decortications</b> and bone grafting. Electrical stimulation at DRG might be an attractive minimal invasive bioengineering approach and an alternative therapy for intertransverse process fusion that is increasingly being used for the treatment of degenerative spine disorders.
