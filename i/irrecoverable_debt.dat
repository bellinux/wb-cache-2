50|$|After the 1997-98 Asian {{financial}} crisis, the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) {{stated that}} Humpuss Group {{was the third}} largest debtor of irrecoverable loans from domestic banks, mostly from state banks, with a total debt of Rp 5.7 trillion in 2001. This was is 2.5 times Humpuss Group’s annual sales in 1996. Of the total <b>irrecoverable</b> <b>debt,</b> more than half had been borrowed by PT Timor Putra Nasional. The debt was partly repaid to IBRA in assets, and some was later settled through debt restructuring schemes and debt-to-equity swaps.|$|E
25|$|Most councillors contemplating delaying {{setting a}} rate {{considered}} that the crucial point would {{come at the}} point in the year when the first rate payments would have become due; if the council had not set a rate at that point, it would be unable to recover the interest on the payments due to have been made to it. The General Rate Act 1967 section 50 and schedule 10 gave ratepayers the right to pay by ten instalments which were to be paid at monthly intervals during the year. With a financial year ending on 31 March, the latest date to start the payment was 1 July; the council had to give ten days' notice of a payment being due, so the latest date for setting a rate without incurring <b>irrecoverable</b> <b>debts</b> was 20 June.|$|R
50|$|The {{directors}} of the Exchange Banking Company had presented account reports before shareholder meetings, which were untrue. Between 1873 and 1878 they paid half yearly dividends totalling £3,192 when they knew items in the accounts were bad <b>debts,</b> <b>irrecoverable</b> and consequently there were no distributable profits. The shareholders acted on the reports and declared dividends. The liquidator issued a summons against five former directors.|$|R
50|$|Anglo-American {{legal theory}} and {{practice}} has examples of two options for dealing with this problem. One is to require a return that {{is equal to the}} benefit received, but to limit the use of that requirement in special cases. Bankruptcy rules are in part designed to prevent downward, <b>irrecoverable</b> spirals of <b>debt</b> while still exacting a considerable penalty. Similarly, there are rules for rescinding unconscionable contracts, preventing unjust enrichment, and dealing with cases in which contractual obligations have become impossible to perform. These rules typically have considerable transaction costs.|$|R
