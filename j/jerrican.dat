50|$|A {{jerrycan}} (also {{written as}} jerry can or <b>jerrican)</b> is a robust liquid container made from pressed steel. It was designed in Germany in the 1930s for military use to hold 20 L of fuel. The {{development of the}} jerrycan was a significant improvement on earlier designs, which required tools and funnels to use. Today similar designs are used for fuel and water containers, {{some of which are}} also produced in plastic. The designs usually emulate the original steel design and are still known as jerrycans.|$|E
40|$|The basic {{requirements}} for transport of dangerous gods are that a packaging shall {{be able to}} withstand certain mechanical and chemical stresses, as stated in SRVFS 2006 : 7. The requirements shall guarantee a reasonable level of protection for both humans and environment and is intended to create a system taking into account different types of substances and packaging. Principles for classification, packing requirements, testing procedures shall be simple and clear and guarantee that a minimum level of safety can be achieved without advanced technical equipment and expertise. No requirements concerning test temperatures are given in the regulations but in the standard SS-EN-ISO 16104 : 2003 “Packaging – Transport packaging for dangerous goods – Test Methods” the internal hydraulic pressure test, for plastics drums, jerricans and composite packaging, shall be performed at a temperature of + 12 °C, otherwise the internal test pressure shall be adjusted with a pressurization factor corresponding to the temperatures used in the test. At temperatures below + 12 +/- 2 °C the test pressure is increased and if the temperature is higher the pressure is lowered. Correction factors exist from + 2 °C to + 20 °C, and for all temperatures above + 20 °C the correction factor {{is the same as}} for + 20 °C. Neither ADR, IMDG-code, ICAO-TI or the UN-recommendations recommend any test temperature. The aim with this project was to perform internal pressure test at different water temperatures. Three jerricans of each type were tested at the following temperatures: + 3, + 20, + 40 and + 55 °C. As {{can be seen in the}} test results the burst pressure decreases substantially with rising temperature. For <b>jerrican</b> A the burst pressure is reduced from 234 kPa at + 3 °C to 175 kPa at + 20 °C, 151 kPa at 40 °C and 114 kPa at + 55 °C. At + 55 °C the burst pressure is reduced to less than half what it was at + 3 °C. <b>Jerrican</b> B is also reduced from 545 kPA at + 3 °C to 226 kPa at + 55 °C while <b>jerrican</b> C is only reduced from 185 kPa to 136 kPa in the same temperature interval. The gradient of the correction factor in table 3 in EN ISO 16104 : 2003 correspond very well with gradient of the tested jerricans in the temperature span between + 2 °C and + 20 °C. All jerricans were made of PE. The pressure/temperature curves show a linear gradient but indicates that the gradient can differ between different materials. <b>Jerrican</b> A and B are produced by the same manufacturer in the same material and show corresponding behaviour, also corresponding to the correction factors in the standard. <b>Jerrican</b> C is produced by another manufacturer and does not show such significant reduction of burst pressure at higher temperatures...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} if the possible interpretations of the UN stacking recommendation could lead to different results. If this is possible the recommendation would need to be rewritten to eliminate the possibility of the same product passing or failing within the standard. The focus of this study was a plastic <b>jerrican</b> filled with water. The acceptable methods that are mentioned in the recommendation are the type of compression and the optional use of a fixture to simulate nesting. Each <b>jerrican</b> was filled in accordance with the recommendation and allowed to Condition in the testing room at 23 °C and 50 % humidity for at least 24 hours. The packagings were tested until an appropriate stacking load was placed on to the package. At these loads, the deflections were compared from each test set up as described by the UN recommendation. A statistical evaluation was used to compare the results from each set up with a single variable. This test showed that it was unlikely that the same deflections would occur with the different set ups and that unguided compression would have greater deflections. A long term stacking test was performed at 40 °C and showed that unguided stacking test would also have a faster creep rate. The position of the package under the unguided compression was also studied. A CAD image was used to control the position of the package as it was moved to specific offsets. This showed a 1 cm offset could greatly change the deflection and that the movement on the bottom of the plate would change the angle of the swivel platen. Digital Imaging Correlation (DIC) was used to highlight the internal localized stress. These stresses were analyzed in both guided and unguided compression. The different methods will give different overall deflections at the same load...|$|E
50|$|Once {{the bridges}} were in place, the RE had to provide {{protection}} for them. In {{conjunction with the}} Royal Navy, they constructed booms across the river to prevent the enemy floating boats or mines downstream to damage the bridges. In XXX Corps' sector, 18th GHQTRE was instructed to build two 'Arrow' booms devised by the engineers of US Seventh Army. However, the RE had problems with this design, and instead stretched one of steel wire rope and <b>Jerricans</b> across the river well upstream of Rees.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{important}} contribution of camel milk to food security for pastoralists in Kenya, {{little is known}} about the postharvest handling, preservation and processing practices. In this study, existing postharvest handling, preservation and processing practices for camel milk by pastoralists in Isiolo, Kenya were assessed through cross-sectional survey and focus group discussions. A total of 167 camel milk producer households, 50 primary and 50 secondary milk traders were interviewed. Survey findings showed that milking was predominantly handled by herds-boys (45. 0 %) or male household heads (23. 8 %) and occasionally by spouses (16. 6 %), sons (13. 9 %) and daughters (0. 7 %). The main types of containers used by both producers and traders to handle milk were plastic <b>jerricans</b> (recycled cooking oil containers), because they were cheap, light and better suited for transport in vehicles. Milk processing was the preserve of women, with fresh camel milk and spontaneously fermented camel milk (suusa) being the main products. Fresh milk was preserved by smoking of milk containers and boiling. Smoking was the predominant practice, and was for extendin...|$|R
5000|$|... : Concrete {{help was}} {{initially}} refused by the US government; however, on September 2, Condoleezza Rice {{said that the}} US authorities would assess the situation and contact French authorities accordingly. On September 4, US authorities formally requested French assistance. France offered disaster relief stocks prepositioned in Martinique (600 tents, around 1000 beds, 60 generators, 30 pumps, 3 water purification stations, 1000 folding <b>jerricans</b> and other material). A 35-person team of the Sécurité Civile (Civil Defence) from Guadeloupe and Martinique were made ready, and a 60-man [...] "catastrophe intervention" [...] aeromobile detachment were prepared to be ferried from mainland in a short time. The Ministry of Defence offered 2 planes already in the zone and 6 more from mainland France, and two ships of the French Navy (probably the BATRAL Francis Garnier or Champlain, and the frigate Ventôse) and a 20-person team of emergency medical specialists. The non-governmental organisation Télécoms Sans Frontières and the company Véolia Environnement offered aid in communications and water management respectively. On September 7, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated that an Airbus Beluga from Toulouse with 12.7 tonnes of supplies flew to Mobile, Alabama, after a brief stop in the UK to load more food. Two CASA airplanes from Martinique landed in Little Rock, Arkansas, ferrying tents, covers and 1000 rations of food for 24 hours.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to establish the level of contamination of dry cassava chips by moulds and aflatoxins and the associated factors. The {{study was conducted}} in Kumi district, Eastern Uganda where respondents from ninety households provided information on the cassava processing and storage practices. Samples of dried cassava chips were also obtained from the households for moisture, mould and aflatoxin analyses. The factors that impact on mould and aflatoxin contamination of these products were established using regression analysis. Cassava chips had mean moisture content of 10. 14 %. Mean mould count was 5. 0 x 10 4 cfu g - 1 and higher counts were associated with extent of visible mouldiness of the products. Rhizopus sp. were the most prevalent (66. 7 %) moulds identified, followed by Mucor (37 %), Penicillium (22. 2 %), Aspergillus (20. 4 %) and Fusarium species (5. 6 %). A. flavus was the most predominant mycotoxigenic mould isolated and occurred on 18. 5 % of the samples. Thirty percent of cassava samples tested positive for aflatoxin contamination with a range of 0 - 4. 5 μg kg - 1 and mean of 0. 51 μg kg - 1. Drying cassava chips on bare ground; storing by heaping on bare floor and storage in old containers such as <b>Jerricans</b> were among the practices positively associated with aflatoxin contamination. Improved practices like drying on tarpaulin were negatively associated with aflatoxin contamination. Since cassava chips are distributed from Eastern to other parts of Uganda, these results show that consumers are exposed to the risk of aflatoxin poisoning. Efforts should therefore be made {{to improve the quality of}} cassava by addressing its handling and processing practices in Uganda...|$|R
40|$|Dengue (DEN) {{and yellow}} fever (YF) are re-emerging in East Africa, with {{contributing}} drivers to this trend being unplanned urbanization and increasingly adaptable anthropophilic Aedes (Stegomyia) vectors. Entomological risk assessment of these diseases remains scarce {{for much of}} East Africa and Kenya even in the dengue fever-prone urban coastal areas. Focusing on major cities of Kenya, we compared DEN and YF risk in Kilifi County (DEN-outbreak-prone), and Kisumu and Nairobi Counties (no documented DEN outbreaks). We surveyed water-holding containers for mosquito immature (larvae/pupae) indoors and outdoors from selected houses during the long rains, short rains and dry seasons (100 houses/season) in each County from October 2014 -June 2016. House index (HI), Breteau index (BI) and Container index (CI) estimates based on Aedes (Stegomyia) immature infestations were compared by city and season. Aedes aegypti and Aedes bromeliae were the main Stegomyia species with significantly more positive houses outdoors (212) than indoors (88) (n = 900) (χ 2 = 60. 52, P < 0. 0001). Overall, Ae. aegypti estimates of HI (17. 3 vs 11. 3) and BI (81. 6 vs 87. 7) were higher in Kilifi and Kisumu, respectively, than in Nairobi (HI, 0. 3; BI, 13). However, CI was highest in Kisumu (33. 1), followed by Kilifi (15. 1) then Nairobi (5. 1). Aedes bromeliae indices were highest in Kilifi, followed by Kisumu, then Nairobi with HI (4. 3, 0. 3, 0); BI (21. 3, 7, 0. 7) and CI (3. 3, 3. 3, 0. 3), at the respective sites. HI and BI for both species were highest in the long rains, compared to the short rains and dry seasons. We found strong positive correlations between the BI and CI, and BI and HI for Ae. aegypti, with the most productive container types being <b>jerricans,</b> drums, used/discarded containers and tyres. On the basis of established vector index thresholds, our findings suggest low-to-medium risk levels for urban YF and high DEN risk for Kilifi and Kisumu, whereas for Nairobi YF risk was low while DEN risk levels were low-to-medium. The study provides a baseline for future vector studies needed to further characterise the observed differential risk patterns by vector potential evaluation. Identified productive containers should be made the focus of community-based targeted vector control programs...|$|R
