This book is not a call for financial reparations. Instead, I <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a formidable plea for a resurrection and fundamental reinterpretation of a tortured chapter in the collective American past.|$|E
500|$|Chester Arthur was at {{his home}} in New York City on the night of September 19, when word came that Garfield had died. After first getting the news, Arthur said [...] "I hope—my God, I do <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a mistake." [...] But {{confirmation}} by telegram came soon after. Arthur took the presidential oath of office, administered by a New York Supreme Court judge, then left for Long Branch to pay his respects before going on to Washington. Garfield's body was taken to Washington, where it lay in state for two days in the Capitol Rotunda before being taken to Cleveland, where the funeral was held on September 26.|$|E
500|$|Fuller {{agreed with}} the {{transcendental}} concern for the psychological well-being of the individual, though she was never comfortable being labeled a transcendentalist. Even so, she wrote, if being labeled a transcendentalist means [...] "that I have an active mind frequently busy with large topics I <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> so". She criticized people like Emerson, however, for focusing too much on individual improvement and not enough on social reform. Like {{other members of the}} so-called Transcendental Club, she rebelled against the past and believed in the possibility of change. However, unlike others in the movement, her rebellion was not based on religion. Though Fuller occasionally attended Unitarian congregations, she did not entirely identify with that religion. As biographer Charles Capper has noted, she [...] "was happy to remain on the Unitarian margins." ...|$|E

500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the speech's poor reception, Pitt effectively promised Cornwallis carte blanche to build support for union. [...] Portland wrote to Cornwallis, [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> unnecessary to assure your excellency that whatever your decisions may be you may depend upon their receiving the unreserved sanction and support of His Majesty's servants." [...] On the basis of these assurances, Cornwallis and Castlereagh developed a plan to coopt or convince enough of the propertied interests that controlled the parliament to support the union. [...] Cornwallis found this task, which occupied much of the next year, to be extremely distasteful: [...] "My occupation is now of the most unpleasant nature, negotiating and jobbing with the most corrupt people under heaven. [...] I despise and hate myself every hour for engaging in such dirty work, and am supported only by the reflection that without an Union the British Empire must be dissolved." [...] The task was made somewhat more pleasant by the arrival of his son for a short visit in July 1799.|$|E
500|$|The Castle of Zafra in Guadalajara, Spain {{stood in}} for the Tower of Joy in the {{flashback}} scene involving a young Ned Stark and Ser Arthur Dayne, as witnessed by Bran Stark and the Three-eyed Raven. During filming of the scene, it was reported widely among media sources after {{a fan of the}} series had snuck their way onto a nearby mountain and filmed {{a small portion of the}} fighting scenes that occurred. Robert Aramayo (young Eddard Stark) spoke about the filming of the scene in an interview following the airing of the episode and stated, [...] "We all went through a bunch of training, which continued through our three- or four-day shoot in Spain. It was intense. It was not easy. I did not find it easy to shoot that fight sequence. It's not an easy routine at all. And Luke Roberts, who plays Arther Dayne, he's incredible, man." [...] He continued, [...] "If your move's getting blocked, you obviously can't know that, just like when you're playing a scene through dialogue. You can't know the response your scene partner gives you is going to be the response you'll get. You <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> Likewise, in a fight, if you're going to chop somebody's arm off or stab them in the gut — the intention is to chop that arm off or stab someone in the gut, and you have to play that intention fully. I didn't expect it, but it takes a lot of skill in terms of acting to play." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thomas Aquinas, an {{influential}} Catholic philosopher, presented five ways, or arguments for God's existence, in the Summa Theologica, while his Summa contra Gentiles {{was a major}} apologetic work. Blaise Pascal outlined an approach to apologetics in his Pensées: [...] "Men despise religion; they hate it and fear it is true. To remedy this, we must begin by showing that religion is not contrary to reason; that it is venerable, to inspire respect for it; then we must make it lovable, to make good men <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> true; finally, we must prove it is true." ...|$|E
2500|$|While an {{instructor}} at Moorpark College teaching classes in cinematography, Nava's first feature film, The Confessions of Amans, won the Best First Feature Award at the Chicago International Film Festival in 1976. [...] Later, {{he came to the}} attention of Hollywood producers due to the success of El Norte, which garnered Nava and his wife Anna Thomas an Academy Award nomination, among other accolades, for the screenplay. In 1995 the film was registered by the Library of Congress, National Film Registry. According to Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert, [...] "El Norte tells the story with astonishing visual beauty, with unashamed melodrama, with anger leavened by <b>hope.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> a Grapes of Wrath for our time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fine Gael is {{generally}} considered {{to be more of a}} proponent of market liberalism than its traditional rival, Fianna Fáil. However, apart from brief minority governments (as in 1987), Fine Gael has rarely governed Ireland without a coalition that also included the Labour Party, a social-democratic, centre-left party. Fine Gael describes itself as a [...] "party of the progressive centre" [...] which it defines as acting [...] "in a way that is right for Ireland, regardless of dogma or ideology". It lists its core values as equality of opportunity, free enterprise and reward, security, integrity and <b>hope.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> strongly in favour of the European Union and opposed to physical force Irish republicanism. The party's youth wing, Young Fine Gael, was formed in 1977, and has approximately four thousand members. Fine Gael is a founding member of the European People's Party and a member of the Centrist Democrat International.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Hume wrote an {{extremely}} brief autobiographical essay titled [...] "My Own Life" [...] which summed up his entire life in [...] "fewer than 5 pages", and notably contains many interesting judgments that have been of enduring interest to subsequent readers of Hume. The scholar of 18th century literature Donald Seibert judged it a [...] "remarkable autobiography, even though it may lack the usual attractions of that genre. Anyone hankering for startling revelations or amusing anecdotes had better look elsewhere." [...] Hume here confesses his belief that the"love of literary fame" [...] had served as his [...] "ruling passion" [...] in life, and claims that this desire [...] "never soured my temper, notwithstanding my frequent disappointments." [...] One such disappointment Hume discusses in the mini-autobiography was his disappointment that [...] with the initial literary reception of the Treatise, which he claims to have overcome by means of the success of the Essays: [...] "the work was favourably received, and soon made me entirely forget my former disappointment". Perhaps most notable is Hume's revelation of his own retrospective judgment that his philosophical debut's apparent failure [...] "had proceeded more from the manner than the matter." [...] Hume thus suggests that [...] "I had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion, in going to the press too early." [...] Hume provides an unambiguous self-assessment of the relative value of his works: [...] "my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that subject) is of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or literary, incomparably the best." [...] Hume also makes a number of self-assessments in the essay, writing of his social relations that [...] "My company was not unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the studious and literary", noting of his complex relation to religion, as well as the state, that [...] "though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury", and professing of his character that [...] "My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct." [...] Hume concludes the essay with the frank admission: [...] " [...] I cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself, but I <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not a misplaced one; and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained." ...|$|E
