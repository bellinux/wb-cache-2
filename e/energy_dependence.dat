40|$|We analyze general {{properties}} of the effective Nambu two-particle vertex and its renormalization group flow in a spin-singlet superconductor. In a fully spin-rotation invariant form the Nambu vertex can be expressed by only three distinct components. Solving exactly the flow of a mean-field model with reduced BCS and forward scattering interactions, we gain insight into the singularities in the momentum and <b>energy</b> <b>dependences</b> of the vertex at and below the critical energy scale for superconductivity. Using a decomposition of the vertex in various interaction channels, we manage to isolate singular momentum and <b>energy</b> <b>dependences</b> in only one momentum and energy variable for each term, such that the singularities can be efficiently parametrized.

40|$|We {{have used}} {{data from the}} Cosmic Ray Subsystem on the Voyager {{spacecraft}} to measure the spectra of He, C, N, O, and Ne with 4 - 124 MeV per nucleon (for O) during solar minimum conditions {{near the end of}} 1977. By subtracting both a low-energy interplanetary component and the high-energy galactic component we have determined the energy spectra of the "anomalous" cosmic-ray species He, N, O, and Ne. The <b>energy</b> <b>dependences</b> of such spectra depend upon the charge state of the particles, their source spectra, and the rigidity dependence of the diffusion coefficient.

A double quantum dot (DQD) qubit, approximated with a quadratic potential, is solved using a full configuration interaction method.

2500|$|Another effect often {{discussed}} {{in connection with}} Quantum gravity (QG) {{is the possibility of}} Dispersion of light in vacuum (i.e. the dependence of light speed on photon energy), due to Lorentz violating Dispersion relations. This effect should be strong at energy levels comparable to, or beyond the Planck energy [...] GeV, while being extraordinarily weak at energies accessible in the laboratory or observed in astrophysical objects. In an attempt to observe a weak dependence of speed on energy, light from distant astrophysical sources such as gamma ray bursts and distant galaxies has been examined in many experiments. Especially the Fermi-LAT group was able show that no <b>energy</b> <b>dependence</b> and thus no observable Lorentz violation occurs in the photon sector even beyond the Planck energy, which excludes a large class of Lorentz-violating quantum gravity models.|$|E

40|$|Using {{molecular}} dynamics simulation, we {{have studied the}} low-energy sputtering at the energies near the sputtering threshold. Different projectile-target combinations of noble metal atoms (Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pd, and Pt) are simulated {{in the range of}} incident energy from 0. 1 to 200 eV. It is found that the threshold energies for sputtering are different for the cases of M 1 < M 2 and M 1 â‰¥ M 2, where M 1 and M 2 are atomic mass of projectile and target atoms, respectively. The sputtering yields are found to have a linear dependence on the reduced incident <b>energy,</b> but the <b>dependence</b> behaviors are different for the both cases. The two new formulas are suggested to describe the <b>energy</b> <b>dependences</b> of the both cases by fitting the simulation results with the determined threshold energies. With the study on the <b>energy</b> <b>dependences</b> of sticking probabilities and traces of the projectiles and recoils, we propose two different mechanisms to describe the sputtering behavior of low-energy atoms near the threshold energy for the cases of M 1 < M 2 and M 1 â‰¥ M 2, respectively...|$|R
