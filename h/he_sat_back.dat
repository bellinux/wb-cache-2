2500|$|She said, [...] "Indeed, {{he never}} used to pray or fast more {{than the rest of}} you, but I never saw a servant of God who feared Him more than Umar. He devoted his body and his soul to the people. All day he would sit tending to their affairs, and when night came he would sit up while {{business}} remained. One evening when he had finished everything, he called for his lamp - from which he used to buy the oil from his own money - and prayed two prostrations. Then <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> on his folded legs, with his chin in his hands, and the tears ran down from his cheeks, and this didn't stop until dawn, when he rose for a day of fasting.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in {{his chair}} and looked at the girl in amazement. She was rather young to have {{conceived}} such ideas.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in his chair, {{and meeting}} the other's hatred with a gaze as steady as his own, {{replaced}} his pistol.|$|E
60|$|No more did the {{financier}} {{reveal his}} own feelings. <b>He</b> still <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in his chair, unmoved, in apparent contemplation. The posture was familiar to Langmaid.|$|R
60|$|The guest seemed {{helpless}} {{to take his}} gaze from it, and <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> fallen <b>back</b> in his chair at it when the woman {{came in with a}} pie.|$|R
60|$|And {{she turned}} to the impassive, silent figure of her husband. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> leaning <b>back,</b> with folded arms, and face a little uptilted. His knees were {{straight}} and massive. She sighed, picked up the poker, and again began to prod the fire, to rouse the clouds of soft, brilliant sparks.|$|R
60|$|Mamie {{handed him}} her note. He read {{it without a}} word. When he had {{finished}} <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in his chair, thinking.|$|E
60|$|The {{conference on}} a {{dramatic}} club theoretically included Kennicott, but <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back,</b> patting yawns, conscious of Fern's ankles, smiling amiably {{on the children}} at their sport.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] grumbled Sir Terence, and <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back,</b> foiled for {{the moment}} in his {{deliberate}} intent to torture her into admissions that must betray her if made.|$|E
60|$|Feelings of a {{somewhat}} similar kind animated Nigel as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> leaning <b>back</b> {{with his mouth}} full, a biscuit in one hand, and a drumstick in the other, and his eyes resting dreamily on the horizon of the still tranquil sea, while the bright sun blazed upon his already bronzed face.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> {{with his}} <b>back</b> {{to a tree}} stump all that night, holding the kitten in his arms. His mind was tired, and he talked or thought coherently no longer. Towards dawn he dozed.|$|R
60|$|From {{his seat}} by Mrs. Septimus Small Soames was watching. He {{had a reason}} of his own {{connected}} with a pet building scheme, for observing Bosinney. The architect might do for his purpose; he looked clever, as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> leaning <b>back</b> in his chair, moodily making little ramparts with bread-crumbs. Soames noted his dress clothes to be well cut, but too small, as though made many years ago.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and drummed on {{the table}} with his fingers. [...] "Well, I’ll risk it," [...] he said, at length; [...] "you’ll find him at 17, Beaufort Street, Bow." ...|$|E
60|$|Moments {{strong and}} all-satisfying had been {{multiplying}} for Bent Wade of late. But this one magnified all. As <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> upon the chair {{he seemed a}} little husky of voice.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in {{his chair}} wearily, with his chin sunk upon his chest. For a time he did not think, and then, he read again the {{sentence}} {{in front of his}} eyes.|$|E
5000|$|Nigel Ian Pengelly (May 29, 1925 - July 3, 2010) was {{a provincial}} level {{politician}} from Alberta, Canada. He {{served as a}} member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1979 to 1989. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> in the <b>back</b> benches of the governing Progressive Conservative caucus.|$|R
5000|$|Phyllis Calvert {{later said}} Leslie Arliss was [...] "not at all" [...] {{responsible}} for the eventual success of the film:He was a lazy director; he had got a wonderful job there and <b>he</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>back...</b> Ted Black {{was the one who}} would watch it, cut it, and know exactly what the audience would take. I don't say he wanted to do really good films, but he knew where the money was and he made all those escapist films during the war.James Mason later described his performance as [...] "atrocious".|$|R
25|$|Waight was {{assigned}} to 22 Squadron as an observer; <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> in the <b>back</b> seat of a two-seated Bristol F.2 Fighter and manned the rear machine guns to ward off attacks from behind. On 10 July 1918, Waight scored his first victory while piloted by ace T. W. Martin; he drove down a German Pfalz D.III fighter over Lille.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} him that he had mapped out his whole life. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back,</b> satisfied, and caught the sound of {{emptiness}} in his room, emphasized by the stilly tick of his watch.|$|E
60|$|Anna disappeared, but Ennison did not trouble {{either the}} {{cigarettes}} or the magazines. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> {{in an easy}} chair with a hand upon each of the elbows, and looked steadfastly into the fire.|$|E
60|$|He eyed me sardonically for a moment, as if enjoying in {{anticipation}} {{the pleasure of}} compelling me against my will. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> {{in his chair and}} threw one heavily-booted leg across the other.|$|E
50|$|Henry Woo (March 18, 1929 - November 24, 2014) was {{a provincial}} level {{politician}} from Alberta, Canada. He {{was born in}} Lethbridge, Alberta and {{he served as a}} member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1979 to 1986. During his time in the legislature <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> in the <b>back</b> benches {{as a member of the}} governing Progressive Conservative party.|$|R
60|$|The {{night was}} not cold and Jim had some trouble to keep awake as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> with his <b>back</b> {{against a tree}} a short {{distance}} above the mended line. He had dug out a track and built a new wall {{to hold up the}} stones, and in the morning the camp would be moved. Now he was very tired, but he meant to watch for another night.|$|R
6000|$|So <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> {{with his}} <b>back</b> {{to the great}} hollow tree, {{wondering}} if it wouldn't be perfectly safe for him to slip up to Farmer Brown's hen-house {{in the dark of}} the next night for some fresh eggs. He could hear old Mrs. Possum cleaning house and scolding the little Possums who kept climbing up on her back. As he listened, Unc' Billy grinned and began to sing in a queer cracked voice: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{time came}} when speech failed James Boyd, and <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in his chair, brooding. Elizabeth, cross and wounded, sat in hers, nursing Joseph. And so, in a dim light, time flowed by.|$|E
60|$|Rivera's way was different. Indian blood, {{as well as}} Spanish, was in his veins, and <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in a corner, silent, immobile, {{only his}} black eyes passing from face to face and noting everything.|$|E
60|$|He {{lifted his}} head once more, {{suddenly}} clasped her hand, his eyes came to consciousness, his hand relaxed, he recognized her, and <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in his chair, turning his face aside and lowering his lashes.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> under a tree, {{something}} like the palmetto-tree, which effectually shaded him over the head, and on the south side; but under the tree also was placed a large umbrella, which made that part look well enough: <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> lolling <b>back</b> in a great elbow-chair, being a heavy corpulent man, and his meat being brought him by two women-slaves: he had two more, whose office, I think, few gentlemen in Europe would accept of their service in, viz. one fed the squire with a spoon, and the other held the dish with one hand, and scraped off what he let fall upon his worship's beard and taffety vest, with the other; while the great fat brute thought it below him to employ his own hands {{in any of those}} familiar offices, which kings and monarchs would rather do than be troubled with the clumsy fingers of their servants.|$|R
500|$|In 1996, Ripken was {{inducted}} into the Orioles Hall of Fame, along with Jerry Hoffberger and Billy Hunter, all three of whom were greatly admired by Orioles' fans. A heavy smoker who once refuted a claim that <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> in <b>back</b> of team buses to be alone by saying he did so to [...] "smoke cigarettes", Ripken died on March 25, 1999, at the age of 63 from lung cancer. He was buried five days later, at Baker Cemetery in Aberdeen. The Orioles wore a number 7 patch on their sleeves all through the 1999 season to commemorate Ripken's contributions to the team. A plaque hangs in the Orioles dugout at Oriole Park at Camden Yards to honor his long and distinguished career, and the Cal Ripken Collegiate Baseball League is named in his honor.|$|R
5|$|Minton {{took his}} Senate seat in January 1935. As a {{freshman}}, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> in the <b>back</b> {{row of the}} chamber next to fellow freshman Harry Truman, and the pair quickly became friends. Minton was made {{a member of a}} special Lobby Investigation Committee chaired by Senator Hugo Black, that was set up to look into questionable lobbyist groups. According to professor of political science Linda C. Gugin, a Minton biographer, in practice the committee's investigations were politically motivated and directed against groups that were challenging New Deal legislation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, I'll be damned!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> {{and gazed}} with shrewd eyes at Dale. [...] "What's got into you, Milt? Hev {{you heard about}} my niece thet's comin', an' think you'll shine up to her?" ...|$|E
60|$|There was a half {{reluctant}} admiration in Prince Shan's eyes as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> {{in the dim}} {{recesses of}} his box and scrutinised his visitor. La Belle Nita had learnt all that Paris and London could teach her.|$|E
60|$|After Leduc had {{departed}} a silence fell between them, and endured some moments. His lordship was leaning forward, elbows on knees, {{his face in}} shadow. At length <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back,</b> {{and looked at his}} companion across the little intervening space.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> at the <b>back</b> of the coach, and {{the weather}} being fine all the {{curtains}} were drawn up {{so that he might}} view the decorations of the city against the Queen's public entry on Sunday. The Duc d'Epernon was on his right, the Duc de Montbazon and the Marquis de la Force on his left. Lavordin and Roquelaure were in the right boot, whilst near the left boot, opposite to Henry, sat Mirebeau and du Plessis Liancourt. He was attended only by a small number of gentlemen on horseback, and some footmen.|$|R
60|$|One {{morning after}} a heavy snow-fall, Czar {{went out to}} take a turn {{up and down the}} path. As <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> with his <b>back</b> to the gate, meditatively {{watching}} some doves on the shed-roof, a big bull-dog entered the yard, and basely attacked him in the rear. Taken by surprise, the dear fellow did his best, and hit out bravely, till he was dragged into the deep snow where he could not fight, and there so cruelly maltreated that he would have been murdered outright, if I had not gone to the rescue.|$|R
60|$|Tim Tangs was not happy. This {{scheme of}} {{emigration}} was dividing {{him from his}} father--for old Tangs would on no account leave Hintock--and {{had it not been}} for Suke's reputation and his own dignity, Tim would at the last moment have abandoned the project. As <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> in the <b>back</b> part of the room he regarded her moodily, and the fire and the boxes. One thing he had particularly noticed this evening--she was very restless; fitful in her actions, unable to remain seated, and in a marked degree depressed.|$|R
