In an interview Jones {{stated that he}} developed the game for his own amusement; he enjoyed the reactions people gave to the game. The original, pre-release, version of the game featured more grisly images.

Some reviewers criticized the game's gameplay as repetitive but praised as being fun and akin to a horror movie by others.|$|E

25|$|While {{dealing with}} crisis, both {{personal}} and societal, there are five basic principles outlined for intervention. Victims are initially {{at high risk for}} maladaptive coping or immobilization. Intervening as quickly as possible is imperative. Resource mobilization should be immediately enacted in order to provide victims with the tools they need to return to some sort of order and normalcy, in addition to enable eventual independent functioning. The next step is to facilitate understanding of the event by processing the situation or trauma. This is done in order to help the victim {{gain a better understanding of}} what has occurred and allowing him or her to express <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> experience. Additionally, the counselor should assist the victim(s) in problem solving within the context of their situation and feelings. This is necessary for developing self-efficacy and self-reliance. Helping the victim get back to being able to function independently by actively facilitating problem solving, assisting in developing appropriate strategies for addressing those concerns, and in helping putting those strategies into action. This is done in hopes of assisting the victim to become self-reliant.|$|E
40|$|Four studies {{support the}} {{development}} and validation of a framework for understanding the range of social psychological outcomes valued subjectively as consequences of negotiations. Study 1 inductively elicited and coded elements of subjective value among students, community members, and practitioners, revealing 20 categories that theorists in Study 2 sorted into 4 underlying subconstructs: <b>Feelings</b> <b>About</b> <b>the</b> Instrumental Outcome, <b>Feelings</b> <b>About</b> <b>the</b> Self, <b>Feelings</b> <b>About</b> <b>the</b> Negotiation Process, and <b>Feelings</b> <b>About</b> <b>the</b> Relationship. Study 3 proposed a new Subjective Value Inventory (SVI) and confirmed its 4 -factor structure. Study 4 presents convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity data for the SVI. Indeed, subjective value was a better predictor than economic outcomes of future negotiation decisions. Results suggest the SVI is a promising tool to systematize and encourage research on subjective outcomes of negotiation...|$|R

25|$|In February 2012, Schuyler Yancey {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Dr. Cameron Davis. Yancey made his debut on the April 5, 2012 episode. Supermodel, turned actor, known for his {{appearance}} as Rihanna's love interest the California King Bed music video, Nathan Owens began taping the role in late September, in secret. On October 1, 2012, several sources, including Soap Opera Digest confirmed that Owens had joined the cast. Owens was spotted on set for the show's 12, 000th episode during a press conference. However, the producers refused to comment on the role Owens would be playing. The actor himself later confirmed through his own personal Facebook that he had been cast in the role of Cameron. Owens's Instagram message about the casting was believed to be an accident. Soaps In Depth later confirmed that Owens would make his first appearance on the December 21 as a replacement for Yancey. However, due to news coverage of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Davis first air date was postponed to December 24, 2012. Owens found out about the role through his manager. In an interview, Owens revealed that he went out for the role of Rodney. He worked with casting director, Marnie Saitta and went through several tests. Owens admitted that he had a good <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> casting because he was given several opportunities to go over the material. Saitta called him back shortly after his test and told Owens to come back in a few days. He went back and forth a few times before he met with the producers and tested with Kate Mansi who portrayed Abigail. Owens signed on to play Cameron and beat out 15 other actors for the role. Owens admitted to being hesitant about replacing someone, though Yancey was only in the role {{for a short period of}} time, people had already gotten used to him, and Owens said that he felt like he was under a magnifying glass when he started, and that the potential critics made him a bit nervous. On September 21, 2013, at Kate Mansi's birthday party, Owens announced his departure from the series and revealed that he would last air in November.|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the first}} season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Shadows" [...] was rated a C+, with the episode being called [...] "exceedingly awkward", while the political context {{was seen as a}} weak point. Keith Phipps, writing for The A.V. Club, had mixed <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> episode, rating it a C+. He felt that the episode's plot worked well, though the supernatural elements seemed [...] "a little corny". Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, was more positive about the episode, calling it [...] "fun viewing" [...] and feeling that [...] "with characters we could care about and a far more rounded plot, this proved one of the better episodes so far. I still wouldn’t call it a particularly brilliant one, though, either".|$|E

Supervising producer Josh Singer later noted how [...] "August" [...] helped them write the rest of the season, [...] "There was one episode, 'August', which was all about the Observers, that I feel was mythology without being mythology. And somehow, in working that episode, we sort of found a new creative vein. And it's not that that episode was necessarily so related to everything else we did. But I feel like it sort of opened us up in terms of how we were <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> year".|$|E

500|$|In January 1969, Kennedy {{defeated}} Louisiana Senator Russell B. Long by a 31–26 margin {{to become}} Senate Majority Whip, the youngest person to attain that position. While this further boosted his presidential image, he also appeared conflicted by {{the inevitability of}} having {{to run for the}} position; [...] "Few who knew him doubted that in one sense he very much wanted to take that path", Time magazine reported, but [...] "he had a fatalistic, almost doomed <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> prospect". The reluctance was in part due to the danger; Kennedy reportedly observed, [...] "I know that I'm going to get my ass shot off one day, and I don't want to." [...] Indeed, there were a constant series of death threats made against Kennedy for {{much of the rest of}} his career.|$|E
500|$|The bad <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{proceeds}} from the Lord's Test lingered and, {{at the end of}} their tour, the Fourth Australians faced more recriminations from the British press. Among other things, they were accused of [...] "introducing a bloodthirsty spirit" [...] and [...] "playing too obviously for money's sake". This criticism was countered by The Australasian of 11 October, whose cricket writer Tom Horan, though himself no supporter of Murdoch's team, objected to the [...] "spiteful criticism from certain portions of the English press" [...] and pointed out the [...] "narrow-minded and insulting abuse levelled at the Australian cricketers". However, in his history of Lord's, Warner stated that the Australians had [...] "evidently come into favour" [...] and that [...] "the rows and bickerings of the past were happily over and done with".|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the first}} season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "The Jersey Devil" [...] was rated a C, with the episode being called [...] "corny", and full of [...] "needless philosophizing"; it was noted however that the sub-plot concerning Scully's private life {{set the stage for}} the series' future. Keith Phipps, writing for The A.V. Club, had mixed <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> episode, rating it a C. He felt that the scenes featuring Scully's private life and Mulder speaking to a group of homeless people were effectively done, although the episode overall was [...] "pretty silly" [...] and took [...] "a decent idea to a dead end". Producer James Wong was critical of the episode, feeling that it [...] "ran out of steam in the middle. It didn't go anywhere; there weren't enough complications to it", though he added that it had been [...] "beautifully shot".|$|E

500|$|... "The Holy Trinity" [...] {{received}} {{very positive}} reviews from critics upon its release. Comparisons were often drawn to Top Gear by critics. Luke Reilly of IGN awarded the episode {{a score of}} 8.0/10, stating that the show had gotten off to a [...] "confident start" [...] with the episode and that it [...] "doesn't reinvent the Top Gear formula, but rather refines it." [...] Neela Debnath of Daily Express complimented the episode's similarities with Top Gear, feeling {{as though it was}} [...] "basically like Top Gear on steroids." [...] Jack Shepherd of The Independent had a similar <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> episode, labeling it as [...] "the best of Top Gear but with a much bigger budget" [...] in his review headline. For The Guardian, Sam Wollaston wrote that the trio [...] "leave the BBC in their dust" [...] and that they are sure to please fans of Top Gear due to the similarities between the two.|$|E
500|$|According to Victorian scholar Linda Hughes, the {{emotional}} {{gulf between the}} state of his domestic affairs {{and the loss of}} his special friendship informs the reading of [...] "Ulysses"—particularly its treatment of domesticity. At one moment, Ulysses' discontent seems to mirror that of Tennyson, who would have been frustrated with managing the house in such a state of grief. At the next, Ulysses is determined to transcend his age and his environment by travelling again. It may be that Ulysses' determination to defy circumstance attracted Tennyson to the myth; he said that the poem [...] "gave my <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> need of going forward and braving the struggle of life". On another occasion, the poet stated, [...] "There is more about myself in Ulysses, which was written under the sense of loss and that all had gone by, but that still life must be fought out to the end. It was more written with the feeling of his loss upon me than many poems in In Memoriam." [...] Hallam's death influenced much of Tennyson's poetry, including perhaps his most highly regarded work, In Memoriam A.H.H., begun in 1833 and completed seventeen years later.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a mixed review {{calling the}} soundtrack [...] "unengaging". He theorized {{that it was}} due to Madonna's performance. Erlewine commended Madonna's singing but deduced that her vocals made the songs sound like she was [...] "trying really hard to be credible, which makes it {{difficult}} to connect with her". While reviewing the film, San Francisco Chronicles Octavio Roca's <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> soundtrack was mixed, saying that the [...] "delicious irony of Rice's lyrics remains intact, as does the freshness of Lloyd Webber's music". But Roca believed that the Latin influences present in the original songs were missing, due to John Mauceri's [...] "languid conducting of the soundtrack, and most of all by Vincent Paterson's choreography". A negative review came from The Baltimore Sun; critic J. D. Considine felt the soundtrack would disappoint Madonna fans [...] "because Evita just isn't pop music—or, at least, not the kind of pop music Madonna usually makes on her own... As a result, slogging through Evita is like listening to an opera written by someone who never got beyond learning how to write recitativo". Considine was also disappointed with the vocal abilities of Madonna and co-star Antonio Banderas; [...] "they lack the power and tone to lend this intoned dialog a patina of musicality". Finally, Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly called it a [...] "soundtrack of mediocre '70s rock".|$|E

2500|$|Schizoid {{individuals}} frequently act {{out with}} substance {{and alcohol abuse}} and other addictions which serve as substitutes for human relationships (see dual diagnosis). The substitute of a nonhuman for a human object serves as a schizoid defense. Providing examples of how the schizoid individual creates a personal relation with the drug, Seinfeld tells of an addict who called heroin his [...] "soothing white pet," [...] and of others who referred to crack as their [...] "bad mama" [...] or [...] "boyfriend." [...] He explains that [...] "Not all addicts name their drug, but there often is the trace of a personal <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> relationship." [...] The object relations view emphasizes that the drug use and alcoholism reinforce the fantasy of union with an internal object, yet enable the addict to be indifferent to the external object world. Addiction is therefore a schizoid and symbiotic defense.|$|E
2500|$|The group {{arrive at}} the cyclops' lair, but instead of a terrifying monster, they find a decadent {{creature}} named [...] "Cy" [...] (Jonathan Slinger) who wears bikini briefs and offers the fighters snacks and mojitos in his hot tub.

Kröd agrees to some quick cocktails (despite Zezelryck's bad <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> whole thing), and they all play a game of Truth or Dare? in the hot tub, where Cy admits he is a bisexual cyclops, or [...] "biclops", and Aneka admits she has had sex with a troll [...] (prompting an angry Kröd to ask if there is anywhere she draws the line). When Kröd insists it's time to leave, Cy pulls a switch and traps the freedom fighters in a cage, where he plans to 'sex them to death' and make more furniture for his cave from their skeletons. However, Aneka distracts Cy by getting intimate with Kröd long enough for him to retrieve a throwing star from her underwear, and Kröd throws it into Cy's forehead.|$|E
