The primary differences between nanoscale capacitors and macroscopic (conventional) capacitors are the number of excess electrons (charge carriers, or electrons, {{that contribute to the}} device's electronic behavior) and the shape and size of metallic electrodes. In nanoscale devices, nanowires consisting of metal atoms typically do not exhibit the same conductive properties as their macroscopic, or bulk material, counterparts.|$|E

Electrical engines can be found as <b>isolated</b> <b>component</b> {{or as part of}} other elements, e.g. the axle. In hybrid powertrains the torque generated by the combustion engine and the electric motor have to be brought together and distributed to the wheels.

50|$|In mid-1960, {{with only}} two {{successful}} launches in six attempts, a NASA board conducted a thorough reevaluation of the Juno II as a launch vehicle. The failures were mostly traced to <b>isolated</b> <b>component</b> failures that occurred {{as a result of}} inadequate testing and checkouts. This was blamed on the program being close-ended, with no further plans for development of the booster, leading to low interest and apathy among those in the program. The JPL team who developed the Juno II had originally only intended it for the Pioneer lunar probes and their interest started waning as soon as NASA began Earth orbital launches with the vehicle. Even worse, most of the design team had been disbanded and its members reassigned to other projects, making it difficult to obtain technical information for the Juno II. The conversion of the booster for LEO launches also threw off the calibration of the spinning tub third stage which was designed for the tiny Pioneer probes and not the larger Explorer satellites.|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} {{environments for}} optimal display of individual antigenic determinant sites on influenza A/FM/ 1 / 47 virus, with preference of its haemagglutinin, were established with monoclonal antibodies {{based on an}} enzyme-linked binding assay (ELISA). Comparisons were made with requirements of serum-derived antibodies to form immune complexes. Two-coating buffers revealed profound differences in their inherent capacities to provide antigenic reactivity; this activity became further altered when, after adsorption, the antigens were briefly exposed to either methanol or formaldehyde. Ionic strength started to become restrictive on formation of immune complexes above 0. 2 M NaC 1. The binding of the monoclonal antibodies to the haemagglutinin was charge-dependent. The form of its presentation, located on the viral surface or as an <b>isolated</b> <b>component,</b> further modified the pH-requirements for its optimal display in antigenic reactivity. The binding of serum-derived antibodies differed markedly and showed a dependence neither on the charge nor on the structural form of the haemagglutinin. Pretreatment of the haemagglutinin on the viral surface with small concentrations (0. 025 - 0. 05 %) of Triton X- 100, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), strongly changes the accessibility of its determinant sites, while deoxycholate (DOC) and octyl-beta-D-glucoside (OG) were not effective at the same concentrations. None of these detergents, however, altered the binding properties of the <b>isolated</b> <b>component.</b> Instead, some of them even improved its capacity to form immune complexes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Developing {{networked}} {{embedded systems}} involves reasoning about complex interactions between software modules, including oper-ating system and middleware services and application-specific compo-nents, various hardware units and the environment. Component-based design addresses this challenge by allowing engineers to partition the embedded application into several components along well-defined inter-faces. The interface specification formalism is of crucial importance in supporting <b>isolated</b> <b>component</b> development and testing. We propose a hierarchical interface automaton language {{for the design of}} embedded software components and applications. The formalism allows the speci-fication of structural, as well as behavioral aspects of components. The paper develops automated analysis techniques for asserting compatibility and composability of embedded software components. A prototype mod-eling environment and integrated verification tools targeting TinyOS, a representative embedded operating system, are also presented. ...|$|E

Synaptic potentials evoked by intrastriatal stimulation revealed three distinct components: a glutamatergic EPSP, a GABA A-mediated depolarizing potential, and an acetylcholine (ACh) -mediated IPSP.

40|$|Potentiometric {{titration}} curves {{have traditionally}} been collected as the difference in absorbance at two wavelengths, and analyzed by plotting voltage vs. log (oxidized/reduced). The collection method, designed to monitor changes in local peak height, is effective for that purpose only when spectral backgrounds do not change slope as voltage changes, and the analysis method is valid only for a single <b>isolated</b> <b>component</b> (one whose midpoint potential is far from that of {{anything else in the}} mixture). Yet these methods are commonly used where such restrictions do not pertain, e. g. the study of cytochromes in mitonchondria.

40|$|AbstractProcess-oriented {{programming}} is a design methodology in which software applications are constructed from communicating concurrent processes. A typical process-oriented design involves {{the composition of}} a large number of small <b>isolated</b> <b>component</b> processes. These concurrent components allow for the scalable parallel execution of the resulting application on both shared-memory and distributed-memory architectures. In this paper we present a runtime designed to support process-oriented programming by providing lightweight processes and communication primitives. The runtime’s scheduler, implemented using lock-free algorithms, automatically executes concurrent components in parallel on multicore systems. Heuristics dynamically group processes into cache-affine work units based on communication patterns. Work units are then distributed via wait-free work-stealing. Initial performance analysis shows that, using the algorithms presented in this paper, process-oriented software can execute with an efficiency approaching that of optimised sequential and coarse-grain threaded designs...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{for the improvement}} of the resolution and clarity of bilinear time frequency distributions generated from signals consisting of a number of approximately time-frequency disjoint components. The method involves the determination of the parameters of a finite mixture of Gaussians, which is used to model an initial time-frequency distribution. The expectation-maximisation algorithm and the functional merging technique are used to derive the parameter set, including the number of Gaussians in the mixture. The mixture model indicates the number of (linear) components in the signal, and the regions they occupy in the time-frequency plane. This information is used to isolate the components, and smoothing kernels are designed using the properties of each <b>isolated</b> <b>component.</b> During the generation of the smoothing kernels, a set of basis functions is derived for each component, which describes the time-frequency region it occupies...|$|E
