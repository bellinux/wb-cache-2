40|$|This paper {{presents}} an enhanced dental identification method based {{on both the}} contours of teeth and <b>dental</b> <b>works.</b> To reduce the alignment error caused from unreliable contours, we propose a point-reliability measuring method and weigh each point based on its reliability when calculating the Hausdorff distance (HD) between the contours. For reducing the alignment error caused from incomplete tooth contours, we propose an outlier detection method to prune the outliers from each contour and realign the pruned contours. And for compensating the error when matching with the spatial feature of <b>dental</b> <b>works</b> due to imperfect alignment of the teeth in which they reside, we propose using an additional alignment-invariant frequency feature of <b>dental</b> <b>works.</b> Experimental results show that our method can achieve (1) 94. 3 % and 100 % image retrieval accuracy of the top- 1 and - 5 retrievals, respectively, when matching with the weighted HD for the pruned contour of a single tooth; (2) 100 % accuracy of top- 2 (top 6 %) image retrievals when matching with both contours of teeth and <b>dental</b> <b>works.</b> (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|According to Diane Dimond of Hard Copy, Torbiner's {{records show}} that Robinul and Vistarol was {{administered}} instead of sodium amytal. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was investigating Torbiner's administration of drugs in house calls, where he mostly gave patients morphine and Demerol. His credentials with the Board of Dental Examiners indicated that he was restricted by law to administering drugs solely for dental-related procedures, {{but he had not}} adhered to those restrictions. For instance, he had given general anesthetic to Barry Rothman during hair-transplant procedures. Torbiner had introduced Chandler and Rothman in 1991, when Rothman needed <b>dental</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

5|$|Berlin {{surrendered}} on 2 May. Records in the Soviet archives obtained {{after the}} fall of the Soviet Union state that the remains of Hitler, Braun, Joseph and Magda Goebbels, the six Goebbels children, General Hans Krebs, and Hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg. The remains from the boxes were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the Elbe. According to Kershaw, the corpses of Braun and Hitler were fully burned when the Red Army found them, and only a lower jaw with <b>dental</b> <b>work</b> could be identified as Hitler's remains.|$|E
5|$|Most {{pituitary}} hormones can {{be replaced}} indirectly by administering {{the products of the}} effector glands: hydrocortisone (cortisol) for adrenal insufficiency, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, testosterone for male hypogonadism, and estradiol for female hypogonadism (usually with a progestogen to inhibit unwanted effects on the uterus). Growth hormone is available in synthetic form, but needs to be administered parenterally (by injection). Antidiuretic hormone {{can be replaced}} by desmopressin (DDAVP) tablets or nose spray. Generally, the lowest dose of the replacement medication is used to restore wellbeing and correct the deranged results, as excessive doses would cause side-effects or complications. Those requiring hydrocortisone are usually instructed to increase their dose in physically stressful events such as injury, hospitalization and <b>dental</b> <b>work</b> as these are times when the normal supplementary dose may be inadequate, putting the patient at risk of adrenal crisis.|$|E
5|$|Sonderkommandos (special work crews {{forced to}} work at the gas chambers) wearing gas masks then dragged the bodies from the chamber. The victims' glasses, {{artificial}} limbs, jewelry, and hair were removed, and any <b>dental</b> <b>work</b> was extracted so the gold could be melted down. If the gas chamber was crowded, which they typically were, the corpses were found half-squatting, their skin discolored pink with red and green spots, with some found foaming at their mouths, or bleeding from their ears. The corpses were burned in the nearby incinerators, and the ashes were buried, thrown in the river, or used as fertilizer. With the Soviet Red Army approaching through Poland, the last mass gassing at Auschwitz took place on 30 October 1944. In November 1944, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, ordered gassing operations to cease across the Reich.|$|E

5|$|The SS owned {{experimental}} farms, bakeries, meat packing plants, leather works, {{clothing and}} uniform factories, and small arms factories. Under {{the direction of}} the WVHA, the SS sold camp labor to various factories at a rate of three to six Reichsmarks per prisoner per day. The SS confiscated and sold the property of concentration camp inmates, confiscated their investment portfolios and their cash, and profited from their dead bodies by selling their hair to make felt and melting down their <b>dental</b> <b>work</b> to obtain gold from the fillings. The total value of assets looted from the victims of Operation Reinhard alone (not including Auschwitz) was listed by Odilo Globocnik as 178,745,960.59 Reichsmarks. Items seized included 2,909.68 kilograms of gold worth 843,802.75 RM, as well as 18,733.69kg of silver, 1,514kg of platinum, 249,771.50 American dollars, 130 diamond solitaires, 2,511.87 carats of brilliants, 13,458.62 carats of diamonds, and 114kg of pearls. According to Nazi legislation, Jewish property belonged to the state, but many SS camp commandants and guards stole items such as diamonds or currency for personal gain, or took seized foodstuffs and liquor to sell on the black market.|$|E

40|$|Noise is {{recognized}} as one of the major indoor environmental issues in dental settings. This study presents the noise measurements and questionnaire surveys conducted in the clinics for pediatric dentistry and laboratories in the Prince Philip Dental Hospital in Hong Kong. Noise level and octave noise spectrum were measured at 60 locations distributed around the working areas. Totally, 60 valid questionnaires were collected, of which 30 were completed by dental surgery assistants and 30 by laboratory technicians. Data were coded and analyzed statistically using SPSS 19. 0. The average noise levels in the dental clinics and laboratories were 62. 6 dB(A) and 67. 7 dB(A), respectively, which are well below the limit of 85 dB(A) for causing hearing loss. Statistical analysis shows that there is a significant difference in hearing status (condition of hearing ability) between different gender, age and occupation groups. Among others, noise generated by the equipment operated by others presents a principal influence on dental professionals. Importantly, suddenness and frequency of noise occurrence, rather than noise level, produce a significant influence on <b>dental</b> <b>works.</b> Most <b>dental</b> professionals <b>work</b> routinely and do not take any precautions or actions against noise at work. Practical application: The findings of this study should first increase the understanding of acoustical environment in dental settings for clinicians and its influence on dental professionals and second help designers and engineers improve the acoustical environment in dental settings.
