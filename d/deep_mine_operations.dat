The upper pool is known as Melin-y-Milwyr, or the soldiers' mill, an intriguing name that implies that watermills may have been used here during the Roman period. Alternatively, {{it may have been a}} sequence of washing tables for the crushed gold ore.

40|$|In <b>deep</b> level <b>mining,</b> water {{reticulation}} systems {{are one of}} the major consumers of electricity. The refrigeration plants, together with the underground water supply and dewatering systems are integrated to form one complete {{water reticulation}} system. This integrated water reticulation system extracts hot water from the mine, cools it down and returns the cold water to the various underground mining levels. As much as 42 % of the total energy consumption on a typical <b>deep</b> level gold <b>mine</b> can be ascribed to the water reticulation system. Reducing the overall water demand and therefore electricity costs will depend on climatic conditions, operating strategy, water reservoir capacity, and electricity tariff rates. In this paper, a method is presented to determine the optimum water reticulation strategy for different electricity tariffs. This model minimises the total operating cost of the water reticulation system by a trade-off between the cost involved in providing effective pump control and the savings achieved under a specified electricity tariff. A case study of a typical <b>deep</b> <b>mining</b> <b>operation</b> shows that a reduction of 65 % during peak demand and 2 % overall electricity reduction is possible by adopting this new control strategy. The corresponding savings in operating cost is 13 %. Techniques were developed to integrate, simulate, optimise and control all components of the water reticulation system. This will allow for a quick assessment of the effect of individual components on the complete system. By integrating all these components into a single system, the operation of each component can be assessed and optimally controlled without adversely affecting other operations of the system.

40|$|Stability of {{underground}} excavations {{is a prerequisite}} for the proper functioning of all other systems in a mining environment. From a safety point of view, the lives of people working underground rely on how well the support systems installed underground are performing. The ground control engineer cannot design an effective support system unless the area of the rock mass around the opening, prone to failure, is well identified in advance, even before the excavation of the tunnel. Under high stress conditions, usually experienced at <b>deep</b> <b>mining</b> levels, stress-induced rock failure is {{the most common type of}} instability around the underground openings. This thesis focuses firstly on the use of the finite difference numerical tool FLAC to simulate brittle rock failure under static in-situ stresses. Brittle failure of the rock mass around underground openings is a particular type of stress-induced failure, which can result in notch-shaped breakouts around the boundary of the tunnel. Generation of these breakout zones is a discontinuum process and approximating this process using FLAC, which is a continuum tool, requires careful consideration of the stress conditions and the stress related behavior of rock material. Based on plasticity theory, this thesis makes an effort to estimate the breakout formation using an elastic – brittle - plastic material model. Due to seismic challenges that <b>deep</b> <b>mining</b> <b>operations</b> are currently experiencing, rockbursting is a major hazard to the stability {{of underground}} structures. Therefore in this research, brittle failure of rock in the vicinity of the underground excavations is approximated also under dynamic loading conditions. The numerically modeled results of two different material models iv are compared with each other along with a previously developed empirical graph. This assessment, when further validated by field observations, may provide a different perspective for underground support design under burst-prone conditions. Master of Applied Science (M. A.

Today´s predominant means of material transport in hard-rock surface mines are conventional mining trucks however despite rationalisation efforts material transportation cost increased significantly {{over the last}} decades and currently reach up to 60 % of overall mining. Thus, considerations and efforts to reduce overall mining costs, promise highest success when focusing {{on the development of}} more economic material transport methods. Semi-mobile in-pit crusher and conveyor (SMIPCC) systems represent a viable, safer and less fossil fuel dependent alternative however its viability is still highly argued as inadequate methods for the long term projection of system capacity leads to high uncertainty and consequently higher risk. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to develop a structured method for the determination of In-pit crusher and conveyor SMIPCC system that incorporates the random behaviour of system elements and their interaction. The method is based on a structured time usage model specific to SMIPCC system supported by a stochastic simulation. The developed method is used in a case study based on a hypothetical mine environment to analyse the system behaviour with regards to time usage model component, system capacity, and cost as a function of truck quantity and stockpile capacity. Furthermore, a comparison between a conventional truck & shovel system and SMIPCC system is provided. Results show that the capacity of a SMIPCC system reaches an optimum in terms of cost per tonne, which is 24 % (22 cents per tonne) lower than a truck and shovel system. In addition, the developed method is found to be effective in providing a significantly higher level of information, which can be used in the mining industry to accurately project the economic viability of implementing a SMIPCC system...|$|R
