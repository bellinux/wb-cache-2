50|$|This is {{the heart}} of the Beehive framework. A control can be defined as a program which can be used by the {{developer}} to quickly gain access to enterprise-level resources such as Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs), web services etc. For example consider accessing an old legacy EJB 2 bean. It involved a lot of boiler-plate code like getting access to an <b>home</b> <b>interface,</b> then creating/finding an EJB using finder methods and then accessing the remote methods of the bean. Using a control simplified this because it did most of the boiler-plate or routine coding for the developer, who could then concentrate more on business logic rather than worrying about the inner-details of Java EE technology. If the developer was sufficiently advanced, even then it was useful because then the developer could concentrate on more useful things like constructing a Facade to a complex set of application APIs. In essence a control to a legacy EJB 2 bean ensured that the developer could simply use the control and call any business method of the EJB, using it in the same way as any other Java class. When EJB 3 came around, such simplification was already provided by the EJB specification itself, and Beehive controls were of little further use here. The Controls come with a standard set of controls wiz EJB Control, Webservice Control, Database Control and JMS Control. Custom controls can also be developed which in turn could make use of the controls already built-in.|$|E

These rules are usually only visible within designated configuration interfaces. For this reason inhabitants who are not actively involved in the configuration process can be taken by surprise by the effects of such rules, such as for example the unexpected automated actions of lights or shades. To provide these inhabitants with better means to understand their home, as well as to increase their motivation to actively engage with its configuration, we propose Casalendar, a visualization that integrates the status of smart home technologies into the familiar interface of a calendar.

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{adoption}} of smart home technologies, inhabitants {{are faced with}} the challenge of making sense of the data that their homes can collect to configure automated behaviors that benefit their routines. Current commercial smart home interfaces usually provide information on individual devices instead of a more comprehensive overview of a home’s behavior. To reduce the complexity of smart home data and integrate it better into inhabitants’ lives, we turned to the familiar metaphor of a calendar and developed our smart <b>home</b> <b>interface</b> Casalendar. In order to investigate the concept and evaluate our goals to facilitate the understanding of smart home data, we created a prototype that we installed in two commercial smart homes for a month. The results we present in this paper are based on our analysis of user data from questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, participant-driven audio and screenshot feedback as well as logged interactions with our system. Our findings exposed advantages and disadvantages of this metaphor, emerging usage patterns, privacy concerns and challenges for information visualization.

40|$|Background: meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is endemic {{within the}} United Kingdom health care sector. Recent campaigns to reduce health care-associated {{infection}} have rested on increasing staff accountability and {{ownership of the}} problem and its solutions. However, the existence of reservoirs of colonization in the community now creates ambiguity about sources, which may undermine preventative strategies. Methods: the theoretical framework of causal attribution was applied to explore staff biases in perceptions and effects on infection control behaviors {{on both sides of the}} hospital/care <b>home</b> <b>interface.</b> Forty-four staff from 1 acute care hospital and 53 staff from 6 care homes estimated prevalence, risk, and sources of MRSA. Focus groups (6 care home and 8 hospital) were used to elicit group perceptions. Results: staff tended to attribute the causes of MRSA to external (not self) human factors including patient risk factors and poor infection control practices of others. Teams tend to attribute their “successes” in infection control to dispositional attributions (good team policy and performance) and attribute “lapses” to situational factors (client group, patient movement, work pressures). Conclusion: variations in information needs, ownership, and infection control practices could be addressed by better interorganizational working and support for staff teams to assess their own responses to the probl...|$|E

40|$|Smart {{homes are}} {{expected}} to promote productivity and enhance living experience, especially for old adults. To achieve this, the level of user interface intelligence should be {{designed to meet the}} needs of users and tasks. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of user interface intelligence level on user performances for different tasks and different users. Two objectives were pursued. The first was to investigate how the intelligence of the user interface affects user performance when different cognitive tasks are performed. The second was to determine the differences between young and senior users when interacting with smart homes. A two-dimension conceptual model is proposed to describe the impact of these two factors, i. e., user interface intelligence and cognitive tasks, on smart home user performance. A 3 -by- 3 experiment was designed and three prototypes were developed. Thirty-six young and 36 senior people were recruited as participants. The results showed that different levels of intelligence of user interfaces facilitated user performance with different cognitive tasks. Users completed skill-based tasks using the least time and committing the least errors using the low-intelligence-level interface; when completing rule-based tasks, users exhibited best performance in terms of less error with the high intelligence interface. However, for senior people, because of the decline in cognitive abilities, their performance was not as clearly differentiated as that of younger people when using different smart home interfaces, especially for highly cognitively demanding tasks. Moreover, when senior people completed skill-based tasks, the task load they perceived increased together with the intelligence level of the smart <b>home</b> <b>interface...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{dissertation}} is to establish guidelines for user-centered smart home design and operation for Americans and Koreans. ^ The {{first part of this}} dissertation investigated what types of devices and functions the potential smart home users would want to include in their homes and what their expectations would be. Surveys were conducted in U. S. A. (N = 210) and South Korea (N = 282). The survey questionnaire contained 80 questions with construct validity regarding smart home definition, device, function, network, interaction and control. The following five factors were derived: Environmental connection and control, smart devices (appliances) and their connection, physical safety and security concerns, comfort and relaxation issues, and control restriction issues. All the five factors showed statistically significant differences between the American and Korean respondents. To environmental connection and control, and control restriction issues, the American respondents showed higher preference than the Korean respondents did. To smart devices (appliances) and their connection, physical safety and security concerns, and comfort and relaxation issues, the Korean respondents showed higher preference than the American respondents did. ^ The second part of this dissertation investigated how to design smart home interfaces. Specifically, an experiment was conducted to find the groupings for smart home interfaces that most closely match the thinking styles of Americans and Koreans. The independent variables were grouping method, culture and gender. 40 American and 40 Korean students’ perceptions of the interfaces and their performance times with the interfaces were measured. The experimental results indicated the following. Koreans’ mental representations regarding smart <b>home</b> <b>interface</b> design requires thematic structure/field dependence, whereas for Americans, functional structure/field independence is required for males and spatial structure/field dependence is required for females. ^ User-centered design and operational guidelines for Americans and Koreans were developed regarding both ‘What’ and ‘How’ aspects of smart homes. Building smart homes based on these guidelines should increase effectiveness and efficiency of smart home design and operation and people’s overall satisfaction with smart homes. ...|$|E

Underscoring this issue would not be considered overemphasizing even when data seem to be already fairly available on the problem. An earlier cross-sectional survey conducted among female students of Addis Ababa University and Unity University College (both in the Capital) in 2005 has shown that there was low level of knowledge and practice of emergency contraceptives among female university students (2). A similar study done in 2009 among female students of Adama University (Central Ethiopia) also showed lack of knowledge as one of the significant predictors of non-use of emergency contraception (3).

In our current implementation, however, all human-HNS interactions are performed by voice only. Hence, the interactions tend to be mechanical, dreary and uninformative. To achieve richer interactions, we try to introduce the virtual agent technology as a feedback interface of the HNS. In this paper, we implement the virtual agent as a Web service, by using MMDAgent Toolkit extensively. The agent is then integrated with the HNS and microphone arrays in a service-oriented fashion. Finally, we conduct a user experiment with three versions of virtual agents. In the experiment, we evaluate how the virtual agent can enrich the interactions.
