25|$|The parkway {{was still}} closed around 6:30 p.m., when a Mercedes-Benz ML350 SUV driven by Ellen Schaeffer Brody, 49, of Edgemont, went north on Commerce {{back towards the}} parkway. Brody left work in Chappaqua at 6 p.m. and was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> friend in Scarsdale.

60|$|Sir Henry {{laid his}} hand upon my arm, and remarked {{that it looked}} as though we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with <b>a</b> warm reception. Something in his tone {{attracted}} Infadoos' attention.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{fear that}} we may have some trouble, Monsieur Glover," [...] Toussaint said quietly, [...] "but be assured that I and those with me will {{maintain}} my safe-conduct with our lives. Biassou must have arrived at my camp after I left, and he must have heard there that I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>an</b> English officer, and has followed me. He was present when François and I arranged to send a messenger to propose a meeting to you, and he then assented, but as often as not he forgets in the morning what he has agreed to overnight." ...|$|R
50|$|The film {{begins in}} Honolulu, Hawaii, with someone dumping large {{containers}} {{into the ocean}} and then <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with <b>a</b> few men in suits expecting to get paid. But because he dumped the containers and altered the schedule of those container shipments to the customer, he is killed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Marilla, you'd be excited, too, if {{you were}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> little girl you hoped to be your bosom friend and whose mother mightn't like you," [...] {{she said as she}} hastened to get her hat.|$|E
6000|$|The {{company had}} risen to its feet; Daisy, still showing her pretty teeth, bent over and kissed her hostess. [...] "Mrs. Walker, you are too perfect," [...] she said. [...] "I'm not going alone; I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Once throw {{conventions}} aside," [...] he began, [...] "once do {{the things}} that people don't do--" [...] {{and the fact that you}} are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> young man is no longer proof of anything, except, indeed, that people will talk.|$|E

2500|$|Thought {{suppression}} {{also has}} the capability to change our behavior. Macrae, Bodenhausen, Milne, and Jetten found that when people were asked {{not to think about}} the stereotypes of a certain group (e.g. a [...] "skinhead"), their written descriptions about a group member's typical day contained less stereotypical thoughts. However, when they were told they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>an</b> individual they had just written about, those in the suppression group sat significantly farther away from the [...] "skinhead" [...] (just by virtue of his clothes being present). These results show that even though there may have been an initial enhancement of the stereotype, participants were able to prevent this from being communicated in their writing; this was not true for their behavior though.|$|R
50|$|Gilda, Olivia and Crocetta {{are three}} friends {{who live in}} a small island of Sicily. The women try to live as they can, being inept and provincial; but the chance of destiny soon arrive. In fact, the three women, one night, go to an island cave, because they suspect that Rocco, Olivia's husband, is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>an</b> alleged lover there. Actually Rocco is a trafficker, who is trying to hide the loot in the cave, and so the three women, when they are {{discovered}} and threatened by man, Rocco is killed by gunshots. The three friends make the corpse disappear, and decide to keep quiet, but soon the police and criminals colleagues of Rocco put on their trail. In fact, men do not want so much about the death of Rocco, rather than looking for the loot that the women took.|$|R
60|$|We had not sailed long but we chased a small Chinese junk, {{and having}} taken her, we found she {{was bound to}} the island of Formosa, having no goods on board but some rice and a small {{quantity}} of tea; but she had three Chinese merchants in her; and {{they told us that}} they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> large vessel of their country, which came from Tonquin, and lay in a river in Formosa, whose name I forgot; {{and they were going to}} the Philippine Islands, with silks, muslins, calicoes, and such goods as are the product of China, and some gold; that their business was to sell their cargo, and buy spices and European goods.|$|E
60|$|An {{hour later}} Cyril again donned his best suit, {{and started to}} pay {{his visit to the}} Earl. Had he not seen him over-night, he would have felt very uncomfortable at the thought of the visit; but he had found him so {{pleasant}} and friendly, and so entirely free from any air of pride or condescension, that it seemed as if he were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> friend. He was particularly struck with the manner in which he had placed Captain Dave and his family at their ease, and got them to talk as freely and naturally with him {{as if he had been}} an acquaintance of long standing. It seemed strange to him to give his name as Sir Cyril Shenstone to the lackeys at the door, and he almost expected to see an expression of amusement on their faces. They had, however, evidently received instructions respecting him, for he was without question at once ushered into the room in which the Earl of Wisbech and his daughters were sitting.|$|E
6000|$|An {{additional}} {{leave of}} absence for a month had been accorded to Roden. He had already been absent during a considerable time {{in the spring of}} the year, and in the ordinary course of events would not have been entitled to this prolonged indulgence. But there were reasons deemed to be sufficient. He was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> Cabinet Minister. He was engaged to marry the daughter of a Marquis. And it was known that he was not simply George Roden, but in truth the Duca di Crinola. He had suffered some qualms of conscience as to the favour to be thus shown him, but had quieted them by the idea that when a man is in love something special ought to be done for him. He remained, therefore, till the Foreign Secretary returned from his royal service, and had by that time fixed the period of his marriage. It was to take place in the cold comfortless month of March. It would be a great thing, he had said, to have Hampstead present at it, and it was Hampstead's intention to start on his long travels early in April. [...] "I don't see why people shouldn't be married in cold weather as well as in hot," [...] said Vivian. [...] "Brides need not go about always in muslin." ...|$|E

5000|$|In the film, when {{he arrives}} in Seattle at the club where he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> audition, Ray <b>meets</b> <b>a</b> teenage Quincy Jones that very night. This event is only partly true, as Ray {{actually}} met Quincy {{a few days after}} arriving.|$|R
5000|$|... “It’s {{time for}} a laugh-out-loud selection….something {{you can take to}} the beach.‘No Biking’ is…a chance to revel in the joy that one {{wonderful}} writer takes in this messy, exhausting, life-changing process… Not everything goes smoothly in this story, and Ms. Greene is not Pollyanna. But she is as upbeat as any parent you are ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet,</b> with <b>a</b> wicked sense of humor that I plan to try and channel the next time things get chaotic in my own, relatively tiny family.”-Lisa Belkin, Motherlode: Adventures in Parenting, The New York Times ...|$|R
60|$|When the day {{at length}} arrived she set out at half-past ten to keep the appointment, with many misgivings, not however because she, a pretty {{unprotected}} shop-girl, was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> young gentleman, but solely {{on account of the}} weather. All night and at intervals during the morning there had been torrents of rain, and though the rain had ceased now the sky still looked dark and threatening. Unfortunately her one umbrella was getting shabby, and matched badly with hat, gloves, shoes and dress, all of which were satisfactory. Mr. Eden, she imagined, judging from his appearance, was a little fastidious about such things, and in the end she determined to risk going without the umbrella. When she passed Portland Road Station, and the sky widened to her sight in the open space, there were signs of coming fair weather to cheer her; the fresh breeze felt dry to the skin, the clouds flew swiftly by, and at intervals the sun appeared, not fiery and dazzling, but like a silver shield suspended above, rayless and white as the moon, and after throwing its chastened light over the wet world for a few moments the flying vapours would again obscure it. She was early, but had scarcely entered the park before Mr. Eden joined her. The pleasure which shone in his eyes when he advanced to greet her made her think that he was the bearer of welcome news; he divined as much, and hastened to undeceive her.|$|E
6000|$|One {{singular}} {{thing the}} house-hunter very speedily discovers is, {{that the greater}} portion of the houses {{in this country are}} owned by old gentlemen or old ladies who live next door. After a certain age, and especially upon retired tradespeople, house property, either alone or in common with gardening, exercises an irresistible fascination. You always know you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> landlord or landlady of this type when you read on your order to view, [...] "Key next door but one." [...] Calling next door but one, you are joined after the lapse of a few minutes by a bald, stout gentleman, or a lady of immemorial years, who offers to go over [...] "the property" [...] with you. Apparently the intervals between visits to view are spent in slumber, and these old people come out refreshed and keen to scrutinise their possible new neighbours. They will tell you all about the last tenant, and about the present tenants on either side, and about themselves, and how all the other houses in the neighbourhood are damp, and how they remember when the site of the house was a cornfield, and what they do for their rheumatism. As one hears them giving a most delightful vent to their loquacity, the artistic house-hunter feels all the righteous self-applause of a kindly deed. Sometimes they get extremely friendly. One old gentleman--to whom anyone under forty must have seemed puerile--presented the gentle writer with three fine large green apples as a kind of earnest of his treatment: apples, no doubt, of some little value, since they excited the audible envy of several little boys before they were disposed of.|$|E

50|$|Another {{important}} piece of the Three-In-One, Chief Illiniwek {{was a part of}} the tradition since 1926. The Chief appeared at the home football game against Pennsylvania that year, dancing to the newly-written “March of the Illini” before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> midfield <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> Pennsylvania band member dressed up as a Quaker, and smoke a peace pipe. Chief Illiniwek’s dance is loosely patterned after Native American ceremonial fancy dance. The dance consists of two main parts, the downfield dance and the solo dance. The regalia worn by the Chief was purchased from Sioux Chief Frank Fools Crow in 1983; it is topped by a headdress of turkey feathers (in place of endangered eagle feathers). There have been 34 men who have portrayed the Chief, and one woman who appeared as Princess Illiniwek.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{subject of}} divorce, {{was carried out}} differently after the pilot, involved Blossom suspecting that her parents were having marriage troubles. Blossom confides in Six about the fights and discussions she overheard them having, which is followed by Terry and Barbara's announcement over dinner that they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with <b>an</b> attorney friend. Blossom's fears continue to grow until her parents reveal that they were only having their wills drawn up. Notable guest stars in the pilot included Debra Sandlund as Terry's secretary and Justin Whalin as William Zimmerman, a boy at school who wishes to go steady with Blossom.|$|R
6000|$|I moved {{accordingly}} to {{the other}} side of that big room. The garniture was very fine. But while pretending to examine it I watched my man <b>going</b> forward <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> tall visitor, who said, [...] "I thought you would be disengaged so early. It's only a word or two"--and after a whispered confabulation of no more than a minute, reconduct him to the door and shake hands ceremoniously. [...] "Not at all, not at all. Very pleased to be of use. You can depend absolutely on my information"--"Oh thank you, thank you. I just looked in." ...|$|R

50|$|He is {{the only}} suspect {{in the murder of}} Suzy Lamplugh, who {{vanished}} in July 1986 after <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> man calling himself 'Mr Kipper'. In November 2002, however, the Crown Prosecution Service decided that there was insufficient evidence to charge him. That month, Scotland Yard held a press conference at which, in a rare move, officers named him as the man they believe murdered Lamplugh.|$|E

5000|$|She {{reported}} a visit of CPUSA secretary general Earl Browder, who used her {{office as a}} base before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Capitol Hill for meetings. [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with <b>a</b> study group in the House," [...] he tells her. Marxist writer James Farrell also used her office as a base when visiting from New York City. Such events were relatively normal back then, she recalls: [...] "This was the United Front, {{as it was called}} here in the United States. Joseph Stalin launched a similar moment and called it the Popular Front and Popular Front it was called in Spain... and People's Front." [...] She also met CPUSA leaders Jack Stachel and Herbert Benjamin.|$|R
60|$|Duane merely nodded, and then, {{saying that}} the horses were ready, he strode away through the grove. Accounting for the short cut across grove and field, it was about five minutes' walk up to Bland's house. To Duane it seemed long in time and distance, and he had {{difficulty}} in restraining his pace. As he walked there came a gradual and subtle change in his feelings. Again he was <b>going</b> out <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> man in conflict. He could have avoided this meeting. But despite the fact of his courting the encounter he had not as yet felt that hot, inexplicable rush of blood. The motive of this deadly action was not personal, and somehow that made a difference.|$|R
60|$|But if true courage {{consists}} in <b>going</b> out <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>an</b> odious danger from which our body, soul and heart recoil together General D'Hubert {{had the opportunity}} to practise {{it for the first time}} in his life. He had charged exultingly at batteries and infantry squares and ridden with messages through a hail of bullets without thinking anything about it. His business now was to sneak out unheard, at break of day, to an obscure and revolting death. General D'Hubert never hesitated. He carried two pistols in a leather bag which he slung over his shoulder. Before he had crossed the garden his mouth was dry again. He picked two oranges. It was only after shutting the gate after him that he felt a slight faintness.|$|R
5000|$|The {{day of the}} {{announcement}} of the verdict in the Dharun Ravi trial, Clementi's father, Joseph, released a statement, directed particularly at young people: [...] "You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> lot of people in your lifetime. Some of these people you may not like. Just because you don't like them doesn't mean you have to work against them. When you see somebody doing something wrong, tell them: [...] "That's not right. Stop it." [...] The change you want to see in the world begins with you." ...|$|E
50|$|Callie follows Owen {{through a}} Veterans' rehab facility.

On October 10, 2008, Altinger informed his friends that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> woman he had been chatting with on the online dating website PlentyofFish. His friends soon became concerned when they received strange emails from Altinger, explaining that he had met a woman who was taking him on a long vacation to Costa Rica.

5000|$|On May 16, 2015, {{when talking}} {{to a group of}} Indian Americans, Sánchez made a gesture mocking Native Americans by making a [...] "war cry" [...] that is stereotypically {{attributed}} to them. She described her confusion between Native Americans and Indian Americans prior to a meeting with an Indian-American, saying [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> his office, thinking that I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with <b>a</b> 'woo woo woo woo' (stereotypical Indian war cry) — Right? ... because he said Indian American."Many in the audience were shocked at the gesture, finding it offensive. After initially running away from a reporter who tried to question her about the slur, she apologized for it on May 17, saying [...] "in this crazy and exciting rush of meetings yesterday, I said something offensive and for that, I sincerely apologize." ...|$|R
