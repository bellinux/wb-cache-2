5000|$|In the accord, TSI {{agreed to}} provide their {{financial}} statements from '96 and '97 to the ANB and to only use membership fees and general donations to fund their political advocacy; the ANB agreed to call off the boycott; both groups agreed to jointly preside over periodic town hall meetings to discuss {{the issues raised by}} the ANB and to hold periodic summit sessions to brainstorm solutions to these issues. The first of these summit sessions was held November 18, 1997. By January 21, 1998 TSI had sent their <b>financial</b> <b>summary</b> to ANB, as agreed to in the accord. The town hall style meeting was set for March 26, 1998; each side got thirty minutes for a presentation, followed by an open question and answer period. There were about 70 audience members in attendance. The ANB's presentation started off with a talk on the relationship between Native tribes and the federal government and misunderstanding over Native sovereignty's effects in Alaska; it continued to a discussion of subsistence and the creation of new Native corporations. The Territorial Sportsmen Inc.'s presentation reinstated that they held opposing views to the ANB, that they were strong supporters of state rights, and {{that they would have to}} [...] "agree to disagree". Stitt expressed disappointment that the TSI was continuing to argue with them. A representative from the TSI said that Stitt expected more out of the forum (namely, for them to change their political positions) than they were willing to give. The meeting was broadcast on television. The fish yield of the 1997 derby was 25% lower than usual—possible factors contributing to this, in addition to the proposed boycott, include bad weather and a late salmon run that year.

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of financial ratios {{has been recognized}} by many researchers.

Even though the utilities of financial ratios have received much attention in the literature, until now, there has been no mandatory requirement to publicly disclose financial ratios except for earnings per share. However, evidence shows that many companies within Australia and elsewhere elect to voluntarily disclose financial ratios in their annual reports.

40|$|A {{local model}} for support of {{periodic}} academic program reviews by the Indiana Commission for Higher Education (ICHE) has developed and evolved at the Ball State University library. The process of devising a format to systematically report library holdings statistics to support program reviews and other collections development duties began in 1975; from 1975 to 1979, library holdings for the university's 48 departments were mapped. During the next 5 -year ICHE review cycle, additional call numbers and shelf list measurements were added {{in response to}} curriculum changes. In 1985 a two-part document was developed for each department to support accreditation reviews. The {{first part of the}} document, a library holdings survey for the department, was a quantitative assessment of classified monographs and serials following the Research Library Group Subject Conspectus. The second part was a narrative detailing <b>financial</b> <b>summaries</b> and notable library resources and services, including: related reference works, microform and other non-print collections; course-related library instruction; and interlibrary loan and other document-delivery services. Library staff initiate meetings with each department's chair and interested faculty to obtain feedback relating to these documents or other issues.
