40|$|Background: In {{the early}} 1990 s, {{the governments of}} many {{countries}} took the first steps toward introducing market forces into the provision of health care services, {{with the aim of}} increasing hospital efficiency and quality of care. Several reforms have been developed to strengthen the role of competition, giving rise to forms of “managed competition. ” As a result, the environment in which providers operate and perform is increasingly characterized by conditions of competition, rather than of cooperation. Purpose: The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the evolution of competitive <b>interdependences</b> among hospitals and the impact of organizational demographics on pair-wise competition. Methodology: Longitudinal data on competitive <b>interdependences</b> collected within a regional community of hospital organizations in the Italian National Health Service were analyzed. Stochastic actor-based models designed for estimating network dynamics were used to study organizational characteristics influencing patterns of change in competitive <b>interdependences.</b> Findings: The results indicated that interorganizational cooperation is a significant predictor of competitive <b>interdependences,</b> that pair-wise competition among hospitals is primarily local, and that competitive <b>interdependences</b> are more likely to occur between local providers that differed with respect to performance and volume of activity. Practice implications: Exploring the evolution of competitive <b>interdependences</b> between hospitals is salient for administrators who are interested in increasing their understanding of the whole market. They can better identify direct competitors by paying particular attention to those organizational characteristics that likely predict competitive actions. This approach is also important for policy makers, which may be interested in better targeting hospital restructuring interventions while implementing procompetition reforms...|$|R
40|$|This work {{explores the}} area of global <b>interdependences</b> and the global context. In {{particular}} it deals with <b>interdependences</b> {{that seem to be}} absent from current literature but could be of great significance to identify the biggest challenges that the economy and the energy sector will have to face in {{the next two or three}} decades. In that sense, several issues are addressed: the dynamics of economic growth and its future; the relation between these dynamics and the foreseeable importance that urban poverty is to have at a global scale; the lack and inadequacy of information to approach crucial interdependences; and the need for a change in institutions and thinking habits to analyze the future. The approach focuses on the complex relationships that link urbanization, development phases, and technological changes dependent on products with shorter life cycles, discussing the impact of this kind of process over the genesis of urban poverty and over the structural modifications of economy. At the same time, a view on how these <b>interdependences</b> will become a serious and increasingly complex challenge for the energy sector and long term global sustainability is presented. The author also emphasizes the fact that these <b>interdependences</b> will become a serious and increasingly complex challenge that the energy sector will have to face if long term sustainability is to be attained...|$|R

5|$|Shaktism's {{focus on}} the Divine Feminine does not imply a {{rejection}} of masculine. It rejects male-female, soul-body, transcendent-immanent dualism, considering nature as divine. Devi {{is considered to be}} the cosmos itself – she is the embodiment of energy, matter and soul, the motivating force behind all action and existence in the material universe. Yet in Shaktism, states C. MacKenzie Brown, the masculine and the feminine are aspects of the divine, transcendent reality. In Hindu iconography, the cosmic dynamic of masculine-feminine <b>interdependence</b> and equivalence, is expressed in the half-Shakti, half-Shiva deity known as Ardhanari.|$|E
5|$|Ibn Batuta, {{during his}} visit in 1344, {{observed}} that the kingdom of Jaffna was a major trading kingdom with extensive overseas contacts. The Kingdom's trades were oriented towards maritime South India, with which it developed a commercial <b>interdependence.</b> The non-agriculture tradition of the kingdom became strong {{as a result of}} large coastal fishing and boating population and growing opportunities for seaborne commerce. Influential commercial groups, drawn mainly from south Indian mercantile groups as well as other, resided in the royal capital, port, and market centers. Artisan settlements were also established and groups of skilled tradesmen—carpenters, stonemasons, wavers, dryers, gold and silver smiths—resided in urban centers. Thus, a pluralistic socio-economic tradition of agriculture marine activities, commerce and handicraft production was well established.|$|E

40|$|Gene {{expression}} {{is a complex}} and highly regulated process. Most of the regulation is controlled by short DNA sequences that can be bound by some proteins called transcription factors (TF). Binding to these sites, the transcription factors, can start the transcription of mRNA, stop it, or just control the amount of mRNA produced. The DNA binding sites of these transcription factors have some specific characteristics: (1) They are short sequences (2) They can be located anywhere in the genome and (3) they are degenerated, which means that some mutations in the binding site sequence do not alter its functionality. These characteristics made impossible {{to look for a}} specific sequences in a specific region and, create the need to model the binding sites in order to detect them. Due to the importance of gene expression in the study of cell differentiation and its implication in some genetic diseases, many computational models and experimental processes to model binding site motifs and then find them into a genome have appeared. The computational models can be divided into two main groups: motif discovery methods which try to find binding sites within a set of co-regulated sequences without previous knowledge and motif search methods which use previous known sites to create a model and then try to locate binding sequences fitting this model. Most of the algorithms for binding site detection (both discovery and search) are based on Position weight matrices (PWM), which are matrices of frequencies of each nucleotide in each position, and assume that positions are independent. Some others take into account <b>interdependences,</b> but they need many sequences to be trained and high computational times. The focus of this thesis is to use the conversion from symbolical to numerical DNA and the previous knowledge of binding site sequences in order to construct models for DNA motifs. In this context, known multivariate signal processing techniques can be the ideal tools to construct models which can take into account <b>interdependences</b> without needing a large number of sequences or a high computational time. To characterize the transcriptions factors, the relationships TF-protein were studied, showing that most transcription factors regulate the expression of 5 - 10 genes {{and at the same time}} most proteins are regulated by more than 1 TF. The study of <b>interdependences</b> between positions showed that more than 90 % of the binding sites have significant <b>interdependences,</b> but that the percentage of <b>interdependences</b> is not enough to classify TF according to structure. The conversion of DNA motif matrices into numerical matrices allows the use ofl Component Analysis (PCA) to model the binding sites which captures the information of the <b>interdependences</b> into the covariance, a second order statistics. Using the hypothesis that the binding sites will fit better to the PCA model than genomic, sequences, the Q-residuals can be used to detect binding sites within the genome. When compared to PWM the Q-residuals detector performs as least as well, and the improvement of detection is significantly correlated to the percentage of positions with <b>interdependences.</b> The disadvantage of these PCa models is that they are difficult to interpret. Converting the DNA symbolical matrix into a DNA numerical cube allows the calculation PARAFAC models which are easier to interpret. Since PARAFAC models have unique solutions, their scores can be combined with the PARAFAC Q-residuals in order to construct a quadratic detector that also performs better than PSSM models. When the numerical detectors are compared to detectors that take into account <b>interdependences,</b> they perform better when there are not many sequences available, but there are more sensitive to the number of positions...|$|R

5|$|On 12 August 1921, the League {{was asked}} to settle the matter; the Council created a {{commission}} with representatives from Belgium, Brazil, China and Spain to study the situation.

In November 1921, a conference was held in Geneva to negotiate a convention between Germany and Poland. A final settlement was reached, after five meetings, in which most of the area was given to Germany, but with the Polish section containing the majority of the region's mineral resources and much of its industry. When this agreement became public in May 1922, bitter resentment was expressed in Germany, but the treaty was still ratified by both countries. The settlement produced peace in the area until the beginning of the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Richard's {{approach}} to kingship {{was rooted in}} his strong belief in the royal prerogative, the inspiration {{of which can be}} found in his early youth, when his authority was challenged first by the Peasants' Revolts and then by the Lords Appellant. Richard rejected the approach his grandfather, Edward III, had taken to the nobility. Edward's court had been a martial one, based on the <b>interdependence</b> between the king and his most trusted noblemen as military captains. In Richard's view, this put a dangerous amount of {{power in the hands of}} the baronage. To avoid dependence on the nobility for military recruitment, he pursued a policy of peace towards France. At the same time, he developed his own private military retinue, larger than that of any English king before him, and gave them livery badges with his White Hart, which are also worn by the angels in the Wilton Diptych (right). He was then free to develop a courtly atmosphere in which the king was a distant, venerated figure, and art and culture, rather than warfare, were at the centre.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGlobal {{competition}} of markets has forced firms {{to invest in}} targeted R&D projects so that resources can be focused on successful outcomes. A number of options are encountered to select the most appropriate projects in an R&D project portfolio selection problem. The selection is complicated by many factors, such as uncertainty, <b>interdependences</b> between projects, risk and long lead time, {{that are difficult to}} measure. Our main concern is {{how to deal with the}} uncertainty and <b>interdependences</b> in project portfolio selection when evaluating or estimating future cash flows. This paper presents a fuzzy multi-objective programming approach to facilitate decision making in the selection of R&D projects. Here, we present a fuzzy tri-objective R&D portfolio selection problem which maximizes the outcome and minimizes the cost and risk involved in the problem under the constraints on resources, budget, <b>interdependences,</b> outcome, projects occurring only once, and discuss how our methodology can be used to make decision support tools for optimal R&D project selection in a corporate environment. A case study is provided to illustrate the proposed method where the solution is done by genetic algorithm (GA) as well as by multiple objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{article focuses}} {{on the problem of}} <b>interdependences</b> among Central European capital markets. The main aim of this {{research}} is to identify long-term <b>interdependences</b> among Austrian, Czech, Hungarian and Polish capital markets and the market of Germany. Additionally, the impact of short-term shocks on these markets is under evaluation. In the first step of the research the interdependencies among the capital markets in the years 1997 - 2015 were verified. For this purpose the DCC-GARCH model with the conditional t-distribution was used. In the second step, an analysis of cointegration for the interdependencies among the markets was carried out. The authors proposed to include conditional variances of the analysed markets as additional explanatory variables in the cointegration analysis. As the conditional variance most often reflects the impact of short-term shocks, the proposed approach allowed to take into account short-term market shocks in the cointegration analysis. The results enabled to identify long-term path for the course of the <b>interdependences</b> among markets of Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. The mentioned Central European capital markets make a group of markets characterized with similar long-term path, which are focused around the dominant market of Germany...|$|R
5|$|Yet all {{the while}} Britain strove for independence, {{at the same time}} it sought <b>interdependence</b> in the form of a renewal of the Special Relationship with the United States. This was desired more than ever, as other {{countries}} recovered from the war and once again began to challenge Britain's status. As successful as it was, High Explosive Research fell short on both counts. The technology demonstrated at Monte Bello in October 1952 was already seven years old. The following month the United States tested Ivy Mike, a thermonuclear device. The British government would now have to decide whether to initiate its own hydrogen bomb programme. Penney, for one, feared that this would likely prove to be beyond the financial resources of Britain's war-ravaged economy. The successful British hydrogen bomb programme, and a favourable international relations climate caused by the Sputnik crisis, led to amendment of the United States Atomic Energy Act in 1958, and a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.|$|E
