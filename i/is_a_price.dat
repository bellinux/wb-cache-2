5|$|Ged is {{depicted}} as proud and yet unsure of himself in multiple situations: early in his apprenticeship he believes Ogion to be mocking him, and later, at Roke, feels put upon by Jasper. In both cases, he believes that others do not appreciate his greatness, and Le Guin's sympathetic narration does not immediately contradict this belief. Cadden writes that Le Guin allows young readers to sympathize with Ged, and only gradually realize that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> {{to be paid for}} his actions, as he learns to discipline his magical powers. Similarly, as Ged begins his apprenticeship with Ogion, he imagines that he will be taught mysterious aspects of wizardry, and has visions of transforming himself into other creatures, but gradually comes to see that Ogion's important lessons are those about his own self.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} part of this algorithm is the use of Price Functions and Reduced Lengths. For a directed graph G with arc-lengths ι(·), a price function is a function φ from the nodes of G to the real numbers. For an arc uv, the reduced length with respect to φ is ιφ(uv) = ι(uv) + φ(u) − φ(v). A feasible price function <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> function that induces nonnegative reduced lengths on all arcs of G. It is useful in transforming a shortest-path problem involving positive and negative lengths into one involving only nonnegative lengths, which can then be solved using Dijkstra’s algorithm.|$|E

500|$|According to Jane O'Grady, Williams {{was central}} to the {{decision}} by King's in 1972 to admit women, one of three all-male undergraduate colleges to do so that year. Martha Nussbaum wrote that he was [...] "as close to being a feminist as a powerful man of his generation could be." [...] In both his first and second marriages, he supported his wives in their careers and helped with the children more than was common for men at the time. In the 1970s, when Nussbaum's thesis supervisor, G. E. L. Owen, was harassing female students, and she decided nevertheless to support him, Williams told her, during a walk along the backs at Cambridge: [...] "ou know, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> you are paying for this support and encouragement.

500|$|Hamasaki {{is often}} {{involved}} in the artistic direction of her music videos. They are often artistic productions through which Hamasaki tries to convey the meaning or feeling of their respective songs. The themes of the videos are varied; she has made [...] "sad and fragile" [...] or [...] "emotional" [...] videos ("Momentum", [...] "Endless Sorrow"), [...] "refreshing" [...] summer videos ("Blue Bird", [...] "Fairyland"), surreal or [...] "scary" [...] videos ("1 Love", [...] "Marionette"), and humorous videos ("Evolution", [...] "Angel's Song", [...] "Beautiful Fighters"). Additionally, many of the videos contain short storylines, some of which use symbolism to convey their respective messages. The video of [...] "Voyage" [...] depicts Hamasaki as {{a woman in a}} mental hospital whose previous incarnation was a woman in feudal Japan who was sacrificed to the moon; the video of [...] "Endless Sorrow" [...] features a young boy living in a society where speaking is forbidden by law. In the video for [...] "Free & Easy", Hamasaki portrayed a [...] "twenty-first-century Joan of Arc" [...] to convey her message [...] "freedom cannot be easily obtained; there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> to pay for it" [...] and to express her opposition to her marrying at the time; the video for [...] "Ourselves" [...] featured masked people destroying [...] "effigies of [...] past" [...] such as photographs and album covers to symbolize destruction and rebirth. Additionally, the videos of [...] "Fairyland", [...] "My Name's Women", [...] "Jewel", [...] "Green", and [...] "Virgin Road" [...] are among the top twenty or so most expensive music videos, making Hamasaki the only non-American artist to hold such a distinction. Hamasaki is also {{involved in the}} production and artistic direction of her live performances; they, like her videos, are often lavish productions and use a variety of props, extravagant costumes, and choreographed dances. She has used large video screens, fireworks, simulated rain drops, trick stage floors, and suspended devices.|$|E
