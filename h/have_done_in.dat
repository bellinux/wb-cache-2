5|$|We {{shot the}} clip in mid-October {{on a cold}} day in New York City. The vibe and feeling was great... It was the first video for the album, so {{obviously}} everyone was excited and focused on setting the tone for what's to come. Rihanna and I spoke in depth about creating a piece that was gritty, raw {{and more of a}} street video then a classic beauty piece... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip-hop videos that were made without a lot of resources, working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings, then trying to build and manipulate environments as we <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> the past... I wanted to try and take everything we <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> the past and put it to the side.|$|E
5|$|Wallace {{has lost}} caste considerably, {{not only by}} his {{adhesion}} to Spiritualism, but by the fact of his having deliberately and against the whole voice of the committee of his section of the British Association, brought about a discussion on Spiritualism at one of its sectional meetings... This {{he is said to}} <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> an underhanded manner, and I well remember the indignation it gave rise to in the B.A. Council.|$|E

25|$|The First World War: The heavy {{domestic}} use of coal {{in the war}} meant that rich seams were depleted.

The Eagles' best seasons to date in the Sevens Series have been the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons, where they finished sixth both times. The best result in a single Sevens tournament was winning the 2015 London Sevens. The Eagles' best result in the USA Sevens has been to reach the quarterfinals, which they <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> 2009, 2015, and 2016.|$|E

25|$|It is {{probably}} {{fair to say}} that nobody could have completely filled Wingate's shoes. Wingate had sustained his force outside normal army command through political connections that no successor would have available. The other dilemma of any successor was that they would constantly be second-guessed by those who thought they knew exactly what Wingate would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> a particular situation. The same officers who would go to extraordinary lengths to justify even the most flawed decisions by Wingate, would attack any successor, whenever the opportunity presented itself.|$|E
25|$|When we {{talk about}} a {{permanent}} vegetative state, I am offended by that. Terri smiles and acknowledges the people that love her {{when they come to}} see her. She cries when they leave. How heartless are we to call somebody like Terri Schiavo a vegetable? What are we thinking?When we think about this case, we need to think about the message that we are sending to our children and our grandchildren. What we do in this Chamber tonight is as important as anything we <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> defending our Nation, in doing the things that we do as Members of Congress.|$|E
25|$|Trophic cascades {{occur when}} predators {{in a food}} chain {{suppress}} the abundance of their prey, thereby releasing the next lower trophic level from predation (or herbivory if the intermediate trophic level is an herbivore). For example, if the abundance of large piscivorous fish is increased in a lake, the abundance of their prey, zooplanktivorous fish, should decrease, large zooplankton abundance should increase, and phytoplankton biomass should decrease. This theory has stimulated new research {{in many areas of}} ecology. Trophic cascades may also be important for understanding the effects of removing top predators from food webs, as humans <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> many places through hunting and fishing activities.|$|E

25|$|The {{collections}} illustrate 60 {{million years}} of living history in the area, from fossils through Stone Age artefacts, the Roman fort and Anglo-Saxon church at Reculver, smuggling at Herne, the town's development as a Victorian seaside resort, {{the two world wars}} and social history. Themes include the surrounding area, holidays, piers, the clock tower, archaeology, palaeontology and local history. Thus the museum provides material for education about evolution as well as preserving a sense of local identity, as oral history would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> previous cultures. Most of the museum's collections are owned by the Herne Bay Historical Trust, which inherited them from Dr Tom Bowes.|$|E
25|$|Mass incarceration {{cannot be}} {{remedied}} {{in a short}} length of time, because each prisoner serves a separate sentence, {{the average length of}} sentences has risen over the last 35 years and public support for prison reform is still relatively low. Decriminalizing drugs has been suggested by libertarians and advocated for by socialists, but remains a remote political option. Additional parole and probation can be facilitated with enhanced electronic monitoring, though monitoring is expensive. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld prisoner releases to relieve California's unconstitutional prison conditions in Brown v. Plata, long-standing litigation wherein the federal courts intervened as they <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> most states through the years.|$|E
25|$|While Via is an {{independent}} federal Crown corporation mandated to operate as a business, it is hindered {{by the fact that}} it was created by an Order in Council of the Privy Council, and not from legislation passed by Parliament. If Via were enabled by legislation, the company could be permitted to seek funding on the open money markets as other Crown corporations such as CN <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> the past. It is largely for this reason that critics say Via is vulnerable to federal budget cuts and continues to answer first to its political masters, as opposed to the business decisions needed to ensure the viability of intercity passenger rail service.|$|E

25|$|Although Ahmadi Muslims {{believe that}} the Quran is the final message of God for mankind, they also believe that God {{continues}} to communicate with his chosen individuals {{in the same way}} he is believed to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> the past. All of God's attributes are eternal. In particular, Ahmadi Muslims believes that Muhammad brought prophethood to perfection and was the last law-bearing prophet and the apex of humankind's spiritual evolution. New prophets can come, but they must be completely subordinate to Muhammad and {{will not be able to}} exceed him in excellence nor alter his teaching or bring any new law or religion. They are also thought of as reflections of Muhammad rather than independently made into Prophets, like the Prophets of antiquity.|$|E
25|$|The Eastern {{part of the}} Sierras, {{from the}} Villa General Belgrano area to the Punilla Valley, was {{generally}} considered to be too cool and humid, following the old Argentine stereotype of hot-desert wine-making. Over the last decade, however, boutique wineries have discovered the potential of the exceptional variety of soils and micro-climates in the area, producing wines that have won significant national awards (some near La Cumbrecita, an alpine town that would have been considered too cool for vines recently). The scale of production remains minimal, but large numbers of new producers are experimenting with grape varieties and techniques to make wines that are significantly different from the stereotypical Mendoza Malbecs, often with great success. The large variation in elevation in the Sierras make them suitable for high-altitude wine experimentation, similar to what producers <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> Mendoza.|$|E
25|$|On 3 September 1917, Hutier, {{commanding}} the Eighth Army, ended the two-year siege of the Russian city of Riga. Here, {{he moved his}} troops to an unexpected sector in the Russian lines, and using a heavy bombardment prepared by Georg Bruchmüller and a surprise crossing of the Dvina River, took the city. The tactics he employed—surprise and encirclement—were essentially standard German Army doctrine; indeed, his infantry attacked in company-strength skirmish lines after crossing the River Dvina, much as they would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> 1914. He followed this success with Operation Albion, an amphibious assault (the only successful one of the war) that seized Russian-held islands in the Baltic Sea. Hutier was awarded the Pour le Mérite by Kaiser Wilhelm II for seizing Riga, and his success there also impressed General Erich Ludendorff, who transferred Hutier to the Western Front in 1918.|$|E

25|$|Colonel Henry Hildyard became Staff College Commandant in August 1893, {{beginning}} a {{reform of the}} institution, placing more emphasis on continuous assessment (including outdoor exercises) rather than examinations. Wilson also studied under Colonel George Henderson, who encouraged students to think about military history by asking what they would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> {{the place of the}} commanders. Whilst at the College he visited the battlefields of the Franco-Prussian War in March 1893. Rawlinson and Thomas D'Oyly Snow were often his study partners (Aylmer Haldane also claimed the same in his 1948 autobiography, but this is not corroborated by Wilson’s diary). Launcelot Kiggell was in the year below. Rawlinson and Wilson became close friends, often staying and socialising together, and Rawlinson introduced Wilson to Lord Roberts in May 1893, whilst both men were working on a scheme for the defence of India. Wilson became a protégé of Roberts.|$|E
25|$|Born in London but {{brought up}} in West Wales, Evans joined Glamorgan in the mid 1950s and became first-choice wicketkeeper after the {{retirement}} of Haydn Davies {{at the end of}} the 1958 season. For several seasons at the start of the 1960s, he was at or near the top of the wicketkeeping lists of dismissals with 79, 82 and then 89 dismissals in the seasons from 1961 to 1963. The 89 dismissals in 1963 set a new county record for Glamorgan, though it has since been surpassed by Eifion Jones, and made him the leading wicketkeeper of the year. As a right-handed batsman, he was very much a tail-ender, though in a county side that had more than its fair share of rabbits, with Don Shepherd, Jeff Jones and Ossie Wheatley in the team, he often batted higher than he might <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> other sides. He did not, though, pass 50 in any first-class innings.|$|E
25|$|With {{his newfound}} popularity, Cetera was {{interested}} in recording another solo album. In addition, he had stated his lack of interest for the extensive touring schedule of the band, especially to promote Chicago 17. When the 17 Tour concluded in May 1985, Chicago's management, along with {{several members of the}} band, had expressed a desire to book another tour for that summer and start working on the group's next album. The two sides could not resolve their differences and Cetera left the band in July 1985. Retrospectively Cetera said he wanted an arrangement similar to the one that Phil Collins and Genesis had at the time, with Collins being a member and touring with Genesis, while also doing some solo work {{at the same time and}} also retrospectively, his former bandmate, Danny Seraphine, said that's what the group should <b>have</b> <b>done.</b> <b>In</b> a 1987 interview, Cetera said about his split from the group, It wasn’t amicable, but it wasn’t the worst. It’s nothing that me having a hit and them having a hit won’t make better.|$|E
