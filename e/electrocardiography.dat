5|$|To {{distinguish}} between OHS {{and various other}} lung diseases that can cause similar symptoms, medical imaging of the lungs (such as a chest X-ray or CT/CAT scan), spirometry, <b>electrocardiography</b> and echocardiography may be performed. Echo- and <b>electrocardiography</b> may also show strain {{on the right side}} of the heart caused by OHS, and spirometry may show a restrictive pattern related to obesity.|$|E
5|$|High {{potassium}} levels {{tend to be}} {{a feature}} of severe rhabdomyolysis. <b>Electrocardiography</b> (ECG) may show whether the elevated potassium levels are affecting the conduction system of the heart, as suggested by the presence of T wave changes or broadening of the QRS complex. Low calcium levels may be present in the initial stage due to binding of free calcium to damaged muscle cells.|$|E
5|$|To {{distinguish}} various subtypes, polysomnography is required. This {{usually requires}} brief admission {{to a hospital}} with a specialized sleep medicine department where {{a number of different}} measurements are conducted while the subject is asleep; this includes electroencephalography (electronic registration of electrical activity in the brain), <b>electrocardiography</b> (same for electrical activity in the heart), pulse oximetry (measurement of oxygen levels) and often other modalities. Blood tests are also recommended for the identification of hypothyroidism and polycythemia.|$|E
5|$|Hypokalemia (low blood {{potassium}} levels) commonly {{occurs during}} attacks; levels below 3.0mmol/l are typically encountered. Magnesium and phosphate levels are often {{found to be}} decreased. Creatine kinase levels are elevated in two thirds of cases, usually due to a degree of muscle injury; severe elevations suggestive of rhabdomyolysis (muscle tissue destruction) are rare. <b>Electrocardiography</b> (ECG/EKG) may show tachycardia (a fast heart rate) due to the thyroid disease, abnormalities due to cardiac arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), and conduction changes associated with hypokalemia (U waves, QRS widening, QT prolongation, and T wave flattening). Electromyography shows changes similar to those encountered in myopathies (muscle diseases), with a reduced amplitude of the compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs); they resolve when treatment has commenced.|$|E
25|$|An {{electrocardiograph}} is {{a machine}} {{that is used to}} perform <b>electrocardiography,</b> and produces the electrocardiogram.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{diagnosis}} and findings {{can be made}} based upon <b>electrocardiography</b> and many are discussed above.|$|E
25|$|Also, <b>electrocardiography</b> (EKG/ECG) may be {{performed}} {{to determine if}} there is a significant risk of abnormal heart rhythms.|$|E
25|$|One {{additional}} form of <b>electrocardiography</b> is used {{in clinical}} cardiac electrophysiology in which a catheter is {{used to measure the}} electrical activity.|$|E
25|$|Dictionary {{learning}} {{is used to}} analyse medical signals in detail. Such medical signals include those from electroencephalography (EEG), <b>electrocardiography</b> (ECG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fuctional MRI (fMRI), and ultrasound computer tomography (USCT), where different assumptions are used to analyze each signal.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the basic}} {{principles}} of that era are still in use today, many advances in <b>electrocardiography</b> have been made over the years. Instrumentation has evolved from a cumbersome laboratory apparatus to compact electronic systems that often include computerized interpretation of the electrocardiogram.|$|E
25|$|Key {{physiological}} measurements {{indicators of}} sleep include EEG of brain waves, electrooculography (EOG) of eye movements, electromyography (EMG) of skeletal muscle activity. Simultaneous collection of these measurements is called polysomnography, {{and can be}} performed in a specialized sleep laboratory. Sleep researchers also use simplified <b>electrocardiography</b> (EKG) for cardiac activity and actigraphy for motor movements.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electrocardiography</b> {{may show}} P mitrale, that is, broad, notched P waves in several or many leads with a {{prominent}} late negative component to the P wave in lead V1, {{and may also}} be seen in mitral regurgitation, and, potentially, any cause of overload of the left atrium. Thus, P-sinistrocardiale {{may be a more}} appropriate term.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Ramón M. Suárez Calderon (1895–1981) was a {{cardiologist}} and scientist whose investigations {{led him to}} identify the proper and effective treatment of a type of anemia known as Tropical Espru, the application of complex methods, such as <b>electrocardiography</b> and radioisotope, {{to be used in}} clinics and the identification and treatment of the disease which causes heart rheumatism.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electrocardiography</b> (ECG or EKG) is {{the process}} of {{recording}} the electrical activity of the heart {{over a period of time}} using electrodes placed on the skin. These electrodes detect the tiny electrical changes on the skin that arise from the heart muscle's electrophysiologic pattern of depolarizing and repolarizing during each heartbeat. It is a very commonly performed cardiology test.|$|E
25|$|Measurement and {{recording}} techniques {{which are not}} primarily designed to produce images, such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), <b>electrocardiography</b> (ECG), and others represent other technologies which produce data susceptible to representation as a parameter graph vs. time or maps which contain data about the measurement locations. In a limited comparison these technologies {{can be considered as}} forms of medical imaging in another discipline.|$|E
25|$|Suárez Calderon {{identified}} the proper and effective {{treatment of a}} type of anemia known as tropical sprue, the application of complex methods, such as <b>electrocardiography</b> and radioisotope, {{to be used in}} clinics and the identification and treatment of the disease which causes heart rheumatism. Suárez Calderon continued Ashford's work and investigations on anemia after the latter’s death. In 1938, he published his scientific findings on tropical sprue.|$|E
25|$|Kamerlingh Onnes {{was awarded}} the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1913. Three other professors {{received}} the Nobel Prize for their research performed at Universiteit Leiden: Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman received the Nobel Prize for their pioneering {{work in the field}} of optical and electronic phenomena, and the physiologist Willem Einthoven for his invention of the string galvanometer, which among other things, enabled the development of <b>electrocardiography.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{a second}} cohort study, {{exercise}} <b>electrocardiography</b> was similarly {{found to be}} a poor predictor of acute coronary syndrome at follow-up. Of the patients who had a coronary event at 6 years of follow up, 47% had a negative ECG {{at the start of the}} study. With an average follow up of 2.21 years the receiver operating characteristic curves gave resting ECG a score of 0.72 and exercise ECG a score of 0.74.|$|E
25|$|The United States Preventive Services Task Force {{does not}} {{recommend}} <b>electrocardiography</b> for routine screening procedure in patients without symptoms and those at low risk for coronary heart disease. This is because an ECG may falsely indicate {{the existence of}} a problem, leading to misdiagnosis, the recommendation of invasive procedures, or overtreatment. However, persons employed in certain critical occupations, such as aircraft pilots, may be required to have an ECG as part of their routine health evaluations.|$|E
25|$|Silver {{chloride}} electrodes {{are also}} used by many applications of biological electrode systems such as biomonitoring sensors as part of <b>electrocardiography</b> (ECG) and electroencephalography (EEG), and in {{transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation}} (TENS) to deliver current. Historically, the electrodes were fabricated from solid materials such as silver, brass coated with silver, tin and nickel. In today's applications, most biomonitoring electrodes are silver/silver chloride sensors which are fabricated by coating a thin layer of silver on plastic substrates and the outer layer of silver is converted to silver chloride.|$|E
25|$|Stabilization of the victim's airway, breathing, and {{circulation}} (ABCs) is the initial treatment of an overdose. Ventilation is considered {{when there is}} a low respiratory rate or when blood gases show the person to be hypoxic. Monitoring of the patient should continue before and throughout the treatment process, with particular attention to temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure, urine output, <b>electrocardiography</b> (ECG) and O2 saturation. Poison control centers and medical toxicologists are available in many areas to provide guidance in overdoses to both physicians and the general public.|$|E
25|$|It has an {{appearance}} on <b>electrocardiography</b> of irregular electrical activity with no discernable pattern. It may be described as 'coarse' or 'fine' depending on its amplitude, or as progressing from coarse to fine V-fib. Coarse V-fib may be more responsive to defibrillation, while fine V-fib can mimic the appearance of asystole on a defibrillator or cardiac monitor set to a low gain. Some clinicians may attempt to defibrillate fine V-fib {{in the hope that}} it can be reverted to a cardiac rhythm compatible with life, whereas others will deliver CPR and sometimes drugs as described in the advanced cardiac life support protocols in an attempt to increase its amplitude and the odds of successful defibrillation.|$|E
25|$|The most usual {{trigger in}} sleep bruxism that leads {{a person to}} seek medical or dental advice is being {{informed}} by sleeping partner of unpleasant grinding noises during sleep. The diagnosis of sleep bruxism is usually straightforward, and involves the exclusion of dental diseases, temporomandibular disorders, and the rhythmic jaw movements that occur with seizure disorders (e.g. epilepsy). This usually involves a dental examination, and possibly electroencephalography if a seizure disorder is suspected. Polysomnography shows increased masseter and temporalis muscular activity during sleep. Polysomnography may involve electroencephalography, electromyography, <b>electrocardiography,</b> air flow monitoring and audio–video recording. It {{may be useful to}} help exclude other sleep disorders; however, due to the expense of the use of a sleep lab, polysomnography is mostly of relevance to research rather than routine clinical diagnosis of bruxism.|$|E
25|$|Besides smoking cessation, the {{prevalence}} of smoking among people with schizophrenia also calls for additional measures in evaluation by mental health providers. Researchers argue that providers should incorporate tobacco use assessment into everyday clinical practice, as well as continuing assessments of cardiovascular health through measures such as blood pressure and diagnostics such as <b>electrocardiography.</b> Additionally there are ethical and practical concerns if healthcare facilities prohibit smoking without providing alternatives, particularly since withdrawal can alter the presentation of symptoms and response to treatment and may confuse or even exacerbate symptoms. Clinicians should also {{be aware of the}} consequences that can result from a lack of cigarettes, such as aggression, prostitution, trafficking, and general disruption. These consequences indicate that providers may need to help patients obtain cigarettes and/or monitor usage, although this may result in ethical concerns as well.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{under general}} {{anesthesia}} must undergo continuous physiological monitoring to ensure safety. In the US, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) have established minimum monitoring guidelines for patients receiving general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or sedation. This includes <b>electrocardiography</b> (ECG), heart rate, blood pressure, inspired and expired gases, oxygen saturation {{of the blood}} (pulse oximetry), and temperature. In the UK the Association of Anaesthetists (AAGBI) have set minimum monitoring guidelines for general and regional anesthesia. For minor surgery, this generally includes monitoring of heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and inspired and expired concentrations for oxygen, carbon dioxide, and inhalational anesthetic agents. For more invasive surgery, monitoring may also include temperature, urine output, blood pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, cardiac output, cerebral activity, and neuromuscular function. In addition, the operating room environment must be monitored for ambient temperature and humidity, {{as well as for}} accumulation of exhaled inhalational anesthetic agents, which might be deleterious to the health of operating room personnel.|$|E
500|$|The main toxic {{substance}} {{found in the}} parotoid gland and skin of the common toad is called bufotoxin. It was first isolated by Heinrich Wieland and his colleagues in 1922 and they succeeded in identifying its structure about 20 years later. [...] Meanwhile, other workers succeeded in isolating the same compound and its parent steroid bufotalin from the Japanese toad (Bufo japonicus). By 1986, researchers at the Arizona State University had succeeded in synthesizing the toad venom constituents bufotalin, bufalitoxin and bufotoxin. The chemical formula of bufotoxin is C40H60N4O10. Its physical effects resemble those of digitalis which in small doses increases the strength with which the heart muscle contracts and which {{is used in the}} treatment of congestive heart failure. The skin of one toad contains enough toxin to cause serious symptoms or even death in animals and man. Clinical effects include severe irritation and pain to eyes, mouth, nose and throat, cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms, paralysis and seizures, increased salivation, vomiting, hyperkalemia, cyanosis and hallucinations. There is no known anti-venom. Treatment consists of supporting respiratory and cardiovascular functions, prevention of absorption and <b>electrocardiography</b> to monitor the condition. Atropine, phenytoin, cholestyramine and lidocaine may prove useful in its management.|$|E
2500|$|The {{overall goal}} of {{performing}} <b>electrocardiography</b> is {{to obtain information}} about the structure and function of the heart. Medical uses for this information are varied and generally relate to having a need for knowledge of the structure and/or function. Some indications for performing <b>electrocardiography</b> include: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Electrocardiography</b> (ECG or EKG) {{measures}} the electrical depolarization {{of the heart}} muscles using various electrodes placed near the chest and limbs. [...] This measure of depolarization {{can be used to}} monitor heart rhythm.|$|E
2500|$|Active {{models that}} attempt to {{reproduce}} living anatomy or physiology are recent developments. The famous [...] "Harvey" [...] mannequin was developed at the University of Miami {{and is able to}} recreate many of the physical findings of the cardiology examination, including palpation, auscultation, and <b>electrocardiography.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The main {{method of}} {{measuring}} sleep in humans is polysomnography (PSG). [...] For this method, participants often must {{come into a}} lab where researchers can use PSG to measure things such as total sleep time, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep fragmentation. [...] PSG can monitor various body functions including brain activity (electroencephalography), eye movement (electrooculography), muscle movement (electromyography), and heart rhythm (<b>electrocardiography).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Still’s murmur is {{diagnosed}} {{in the course}} of a physical examination of the patient, usually using a stethoscope. [...] The murmur has a vibratory quality that can be detected as a regular frequency on phonocardiography, although this type of testing is now rarely used. [...] Additional testing including <b>electrocardiography</b> (ECG or EKG) or echocardiography may be helpful in ruling out other conditions, particularly if the physical examination is not completely characteristic of Still’s murmur. [...] When additional testing is done in the setting of Still’s murmur the results are normal, since Still’s murmur is not associated with any sort of cardiovascular pathology.|$|E
2500|$|The {{condition}} is diagnosed {{based on the}} history of the symptoms and a physical examination with confirmation by echocardiography. Blood tests, <b>electrocardiography,</b> and chest radiography may be useful to determine the underlying cause. Treatment depends on the severity and cause of the disease. In people with chronic stable mild heart failure, treatment commonly consists of lifestyle modifications such as stopping smoking, physical exercise, and dietary changes, as well as medications. In those with heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [...] or angiotensin receptor blockers along with beta blockers are recommended. For those with severe disease, aldosterone antagonists, or hydralazine with a nitrate may be used. Diuretics are useful for preventing fluid retention. Sometimes, depending on the cause, an implanted device such as a pacemaker or an implantable cardiac defibrillator may be recommended. In some moderate or severe cases cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may be suggested ...|$|E
2500|$|Medical imaging is the {{generating}} {{of visual}} {{representations of the}} interior of a body for clinical analysis and medical intervention. Medical imaging reveals details of internal physiology that help medical professionals plan appropriate treatments for tissue infection and trauma. [...] Medical imaging is also central in supplying the biometric data necessary to establish baseline features of anatomy and physiology so as to increase the accuracy with which early or fine-detail abnormalities are detected. [...] These diagnostic techniques are often performed in combination with general pathology procedures and are themselves often essential to developing new understanding of the pathogenesis of a given disease and tracking the progress of disease in specific medical cases. [...] Examples of important subdivisions in medical imaging include radiology (which uses the imaging technologies of X-ray radiography) magnetic resonance imaging, [...] medical ultrasonography (or ultrasound), endoscopy, elastography, tactile imaging, thermography, medical photography, nuclear medicine and functional imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography. [...] Though they do not strictly relay images, readings from diagnostics tests involving electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, and <b>electrocardiography</b> often give hints as to the state and function of certain tissues in the brain and heart respectively.|$|E
2500|$|In 1874, Edmé Félix Alfred Vulpian {{coined the}} term {{mouvement}} fibrillaire, a term {{that he seems to}} have used to describe both atrial and ventricular fibrillation. John A. MacWilliam, a physiologist who had trained under Ludwig and who subsequently became Professor of Physiology at the University of Aberdeen, gave an accurate description of the arrhythmia in 1887. This definition still holds today, and is interesting in the fact that his studies and description predate the use of <b>electrocardiography.</b> His description is as follows: [...] "The ventricular muscle is thrown into a state of irregular arrhythmic contraction, whilst there is a great fall in the arterial blood pressure, the ventricles become dilated with blood as the rapid quivering movement of their walls is insufficient to expel their contents; the muscular action partakes of the nature of a rapid incoordinate twitching of the muscular tissue … The cardiac pump is thrown out of gear, and the last of its vital energy is dissipated in the violent and the prolonged turmoil of fruitless activity in the ventricular walls." [...] MacWilliam spent many years working on ventricular fibrillation {{and was one of the}} first to show that ventricular fibrillation could be terminated by a series of induction shocks through the heart.|$|E
5000|$|While still a house physician, Lewis began {{physiological}} research, {{carrying out}} fundamental {{research on the}} heart, the pulse and blood pressure. From 1906, he corresponded with the Dutch physiologist Willem Einthoven concerning the latter's invention of the string galvanometer and <b>electrocardiography,</b> and Lewis pioneered its use in clinical settings. Accordingly, Lewis is considered the [...] "father of clinical cardiac electrophysiology". The first use of <b>electrocardiography</b> in clinical medicine was in 1908. In that year, Thomas Lewis and Arthur MacNalty (later the Chief Medical Officer of the United Kingdom) employed <b>electrocardiography</b> to diagnose heart block. In 1909, with James MacKenzie, Lewis founded the journal Heart: A Journal for the Study of the Circulation, which he renamed Clinical Science in 1933. In 1913, he published the book Clinical <b>Electrocardiography,</b> the first treaty on <b>electrocardiography.</b> Lewis was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1918. He was promoted to full physician at UCH in 1919.|$|E
