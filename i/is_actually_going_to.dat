500|$|British {{film critic}} Mark Kermode gave the film a {{positive}} review, saying, [...] "After an initial 20-minute dip, when I thought, 'This <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be two-hours of mopey-mopey,' I thought it found its feet." [...] He also excused the film's characterization of Taylor Lautner's character, saying, [...] "The {{sight of the}} buff, young guys running through the forest with their tops off was slightly smirk-inducing. But it's fine. They know what their target-audience is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 22. This {{is one of}} our Court days, and I was there. I {{told you}} there is a Drawing-room, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The Hamiltons and Abercorns have done teasing me. The latter, I hear, <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> France. Lord Treasurer quarrelled with me at Court for being four days without dining with him; so I dined there to-day, and he has at last fallen in with my project (as he calls it) of coining halfpence and farthings, with devices, like medals, in honour of the Queen, every year {{changing}} the device. I wish it may be done. Nite MD.|$|E

60|$|A {{while later}} I {{ran over to}} {{announce}} to the amazed Tom Peters that I <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Harvard with him. He stood in the half-lighted hallway, {{his hands in his}} pockets, blinking at me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Every {{one of you}} wrong, though papa comes {{nearest the}} truth," [...] cried Fanny; [...] "she {{is going to give}} music lessons, and support herself, so that Will may go to college. He is the studious one, and Polly is very proud of him. Ned, the other brother, has a {{business}} talent, and don't care for books, so he has gone out West, and will make his own way anywhere. Polly says she is n't needed at home now, the family is so small, and Kitty can take her place nicely; so she <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> earn her own living, and hand over her share of the family income to Will. What a martyr that girl does make of herself," [...] and Fanny looked as solemn as if Polly had proposed some awful self-sacrifice.|$|E
6000|$|No {{wonder that}} his spirits rose more gaily {{as he came}} near London, and that he looked with delight from his postchaise windows upon the city as he {{advanced}} towards it. No highwayman stopped our traveller on Blackheath. Yonder are the gleaming domes of Greenwich, canopied with woods. There is the famous Thames, with its countless shipping; there actually is the Tower of London. [...] "Look, Gumbo! There is the Tower!" [...] "Yes, master," [...] says Gumbo, who has {{never heard of the}} Tower; but Harry has, and remembers how he has read about it in Howell's Medulla, and how he and his brother used to play at the Tower, and he thinks with delight now, how he <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see the armour and the jewels and the lions. They pass through Southwark and over that famous London Bridge, which was all covered with houses like a street two years ago. Now there is only a single gate left, and that is coming down. Then the chaise rolls through the city; and, [...] "Look, Gumbo, that is Saint Paul's!" [...] "Yes, master; Saint Paul's," [...] says Gumbo, obsequiously, but little struck by the beauties of the architecture. And so by the well-known course we reach the Temple, and Gumbo and his master look up with awe at the rebel heads on Temple Bar.|$|E
60|$|Little Pen {{has been}} in the utmost {{excitement}} lately about his pony, which Robert <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> buy for him. I am said to be the spoiler, but mark! I will confess to you that, considering how we run to and fro, it never would have entered into the extravagance of my love to set up a pony for Penini. When I heard of it first, I opened my eyes wide, only no amount of discretion on my part could enable me to take part against both Pen and Robert in a matter which pleases Pen. I hope they won't combine to give me an Austrian daughter-in-law when Peni is sixteen. So I say 'Yes,' 'Yes,' 'Certainly,' and the pony is to be bought, and carried to Rome (fancy that!), and we are to hunt up some small Italian princes and princesses to ride with him at Rome (I object to Hatty Hosmer, who has been thrown thirty times[70]). In fact, Pen has been very coaxing about the pony. He has beset Robert in private and then, as privately, entreated me, 'if papa spoke to me about the pony, not to discourage him.' So I discouraged nobody, but am rather triumphantly glad, upon the whole, that we have done such a very foolish, extravagant thing.|$|E

50|$|The song {{is about}} a dirt-poor farmer {{struggling}} to support his family, bemoaning a stack of bills, his family's needs, animals that won't produce and land that is barren. He even tries to ask his brother for assistance, but his brother <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> come to him for help. Finally, he admits he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pack up his family and leave {{to find a better}} life.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's little {{danger of}} that kind, I fear, Feemy, nor {{would she be}} doing so; but if you <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> speak to Captain Ussher {{yourself}} to-night, I'll say no more about it now; but I hope you'll tell Thady to-morrow what passes." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{success of}} the {{implementation}} of the policy is also controversial because it is questioned whether the policy <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> those who need the benefits. For instance, since the leave offered is unpaid, majorities of eligible employees can not take time off because they can not afford to do so. And according to Pyle and Pelletier, eligible workers may not even know about this policy and the benefits allotted to them.|$|E

6000|$|If {{this meant}} anything, {{it meant that}} she <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> marry Herbert Linley again. This was too ridiculous. [...] "If it's a joke," [...] I said, [...] "I have heard better fun in my time. If it's only an assertion, I don't believe it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a bit, Jack. I heard Mr. Hoare tell Arthur that it {{was very}} seldom we passed within sight of the island at all.

5000|$|At one point, the Shadows of the Empire {{video game}} <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{centered}} around Boba Fett, but {{this decision was}} changed when Lucasarts thought to instead make a Boba Fett game (later made a Jango Fett Game), freeing Dark Horse to claim exclusive rights to center their version around Boba Fett.|$|R

5000|$|Romantic Interlude: Brian and Elsbeth (Jones and Cleveland) begin making love, {{and several}} suggestive images are shown (an {{industrial}} chimney collapse shown in reverse, a train entering a tunnel, a torpedo being fired, etc.), but {{the images are}} actually only films being played by Brian, on a projector propped on the bed. Elsbeth testily asks whether he <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do something or just show films all night. Brian replies with [...] "Just one more, dear", and proceeds to show the next and final sketch.|$|E
50|$|Selling the {{property}} or refinancing {{prior to this}} break-even point {{will result in a}} net financial loss for the buyer while keeping the loan for longer than this break-even point will result in a net financial savings for the buyer. The longer you keep {{the property}} financed under the loan with purchased points, the more the money spent on the points will pay off. Accordingly, if the intention is to buy and sell the property or refinance in a rapid fashion, paying points <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> end up costing more than just paying the loan at the higher interest rate.|$|E

5000|$|The racing {{number for}} Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), the main {{character}} in Disney-Pixar's film Cars (2006), is 95.

50|$|When Woo-kyung and Yoon-jeong get married, {{they go on}} a honeymoon/business trip because {{exhibition}} and honeymoon happened {{to be at the}} same time. Later in the story, you find out that Yoon-jeong actually got pregnant from Woo-kyung after their honeymoon. A recurring joke at this time is Yoon-jeong asking for something from Woo-kyung, he is going out to get it, and then she is telling him that she wants something else instead. A little later in the story, you also find out that Yoon-jeong <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have twins. In the final episode, you see the twins born after the time lapse.|$|E

Once the ship has lifted herself into space Lars and the other 21 crewmen discover that the ship <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the planet Wolf IV to search for the lost Star Ship Planetfall. Such a thing is unprecedented and even more disturbing is the presence of fusion bombs in the ship's hold. Angry at being effectively shanghaied onto a dangerous mission, some of the men attempt to take the ship. The mutiny fails and, threatened with abandonment in interstellar space, the mutineers agree to continue on the mission.|$|E
50|$|Whitworth {{agreed to}} help John Walker in getting highly {{classified}} communications data in 1973; from then {{until his retirement in}} 1983, his work for the navy involved encrypted communications and required security clearance.

She had gone along out of love for Houghton, her first lover after a lifetime of spinsterhood.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} on 3 July 1940, the surprise was terrific - strategically, the French crews did not believe, {{up to the last}} moment, that the British warships <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fire on them, and tactically, because their ships were tightly moored, their guns trained towards land, and as the British warships were free of their movements, ranged at 16,000 m, in a high sea.|$|R
50|$|The Captain William Moore Bridge is a 110-foot {{suspension}} bridge on the Klondike Highway, 17 miles from Skagway, Alaska. The bridge allows traffic to {{pass over the}} Moore Creek Gorge, which flows through a fault line. Built in 1976, the bridge has already deteriorated {{to the point of}} needing replacement. A similarly designed replacement would also have a limited life, so its replacement <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a non-bridge. The state is filling in the gorge, leaving a large culvert for water to continue flowing, and the top of the concrete fill-in will be the base upon which the road deck will be built. Construction is expected to take from 2016 to 2018.|$|E
50|$|At the meeting, they {{convince}} an initially reluctant Braulio to {{take the}} part, but only after he insists that they pretend the part <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> his sister, who the executives don't want to hire because of her awful singing voice. The next day, Braulio turns up {{to do his job}} and is introduced the film business for the first time. As he wanders through the studio looking for where they're filming, he meets several famous Mexican actors, including Tin Tan, Leticia Palma and Antonio BadÃº, who he punches thinking he was assaulting a woman, when it was actually just a film. Then, as he goes to record the songs for the movie, he accidentally insults, then does a duet with Pedro Vargas.|$|E

Axelrod had gotten involved in the movie originally by ABC TV who wanted him to write a version of Murder on the Orient Express (1974) - he suggested they buy the rights to Night Train or The Lady Vanishes. He ended up writing three different versions of The Lady Vanishes for ABC TV but none was picked up. Then the rights reverted to Rank Films, who asked Axelrod {{to work on the}} movie.|$|E
