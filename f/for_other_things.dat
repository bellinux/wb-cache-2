25|$|Existence of {{necessary}} and the unnecessary: Our experience includes things certainly existing but apparently unnecessary. Not everything can be unnecessary, for then {{once there was}} nothing and {{there would still be}} nothing. Therefore, we are compelled to suppose something that exists necessarily, having this necessity only from itself; in fact itself the cause <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> to exist.|$|E
25|$|April 20, 2011 {{was the day}} it was {{revealed}} on the band's Facebook page that the band went on an infinite hiatus. 5 members (Farrell, Rampolla, Vigil, Ghazarian & Gibson) left, leaving the one singer (Liebsch) alone in the band. Soon after, Liebsch wrote a batch of paragraphs explaining how he's sorry and everything from the break up. He included that he had an alcohol problem. He'd steal money (not much in the beginning) from the band's funds to buy drinks. Then another member on the band's official Tumblr announced that Liebsch did not have a drinking problem and he stole money <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> Despite the ex-members' statements, most fans and other touring bands had noted Liebsch's drinking as more than just social. Liebsch has stated to be sober since the exodus of the other members.|$|E
25|$|Partly {{because it}} {{may not always be}} the case that a {{wrongdoing}} trustee can be found, or remains solvent, tracing became an important step in restitutionary claims for breach of trust. Tracing means tracking the value of an asset that properly belongs to a trust fund, such as a car, shares, money, or profits made by a trustee through a conflict of interest. If those things are exchanged <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> (i.e. money or assets) then the value residing in the new thing can potentially be claimed by the beneficiaries. For example, in an early case, Taylor v Plumer a dishonest broker, Mr Walsh, was given £22,200 in a banker's draft and was meant to invest in Exchequer Bills (UK government bonds) for Sir Plumer. Instead he bought gold doubloons and was planning a get-away to the Caribbean until he was apprehended at Falmouth. Lord Ellenborough held that the property belonged to Sir Plumer, in whatever form it had become. It may also be that the value of the traced trust money has changed, and possibly risen considerably. In the leading case, Foskett v McKeown an investment manager wrongfully took £20,440 from his clients, paid the last two out of five installments on a life insurance policy, and committed suicide. The insurance company paid out £1,000,000, although under the policy's terms this would have been paid out anyway. The majority of the House of Lords held that clients could trace their money into the payout and claim a proportionate share (£400,000). Theoretically the case was controversial, as the House of Lords rejected that such a tracing claim was founded upon unjust enrichment, as opposed to being the vindication of a property right.|$|E

2500|$|The {{difficulty}} {{was also}} increased in Jet Moto 2.

[...] The PlayStation Greatest Hits version of the game, dubbed Jet Moto 2: Championship Edition further changed the gameplay mechanics. [...] All Jet Moto tracks were immediately unlocked for the player. [...] Additionally, the number of in-game racers would be reduced from ten to only four to allow the game to run at 30 frames per second.|$|E
2500|$|The half penny {{transit tax}} {{approved}} in November 2002 {{as part of}} the People's Transportation Plan was promised to fund at least the Metrorail Orange Line expansions in the short term, with a long term promise to build nearly [...] of track and 50 stations for Metrorail, among other things. The plan stated that no more than five percent of tax proceeds would go to administration costs. Not only was the money used <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> it was later revealed by the federal government that Miami-Dade Transit could not actually afford to support and operate these lines even if their construction was 100% federally funded, as MDT's revenue and ridership forecasts assumed significant and regular increases in fare while assuming no loss in ridership. This, along with a more recent federal investigation and takeover in 2011 has led to Miami-Dade Transit's perception as an accountable organization.|$|E
