40|$|Radicalization is {{an aspect}} in the {{development}} of homegrown terrorists; however, researchers have been unable to establish a path to radicalization, uncover how individual and social factors influence radicalization, and identify how the Internet and social media mediate this process. The purpose of this case study was to explore individual and environmental factors that contribute to the radicalization of U. S. <b>homegrown</b> <b>terrorists</b> and identify interventions. Conversion theory was used to develop an understanding of the radicalization of U. S. <b>homegrown</b> <b>terrorists.</b> Data were derived from interviews of local and state law enforcement, military antiterrorism officers (AT), and security personnel from military installations in Eastern North Carolina. Data were analyzed applying content directed and In Vivo coding. The study results helped formulate recommendations on interventions to stem radicalization, identified the news media as a gateway for radicalization, and suggested the incorporation of perspectives from other radicalization-related theories into the conversion theory radicalization model to examine known cases of <b>homegrown</b> <b>terrorists</b> and test its viability as a model to understand radicalization. The results of this study could bring about positive social change by improving relationships and collaboration between law enforcement and community stakeholders, which might generate strategies that could exert greater influence in dissuading individuals from becoming radicalized...|$|R

The report stated that the internet {{is one of the}} [...] "primary drivers" [...] of the terrorist threat to the United States.

40|$|Western nations {{continue}} to face potential attacks from violent extremist organizations waging {{a campaign of}} violence in the name of political Islam. Though these attacks are traditionally labeled as originating from abroad, leaders of these extremist organizations are utilizing a new tactic of radicalizing native or naturalized citizens from within Western countries in an effort to bypass the massive defensive security apparatus Western governments have put in place since the September 11 attacks. These undistinguishable citizens turned radical jihadists, better known as homegrown terrorists, represent a clear and present danger to the security of the United States. In an effort to understand the problem, this paper seeks to identify patterns common amongst these individuals and addresses the question 2 ̆ 2 How does a Muslim youth become radicalized into a <b>homegrown</b> <b>terrorist?</b> 2 ̆ 2 This research will use a case study approach to identify patterns of radicalization in convicted <b>homegrown</b> <b>terrorist</b> and test the hypothesis that a failure of integration will cause some Western Muslim youth to radicalize and in some cases, commit violent crimes of terrorism...|$|E
40|$|Radicalisation into {{violence}} affects {{some small}} {{segments of the}} American Muslim population and recent events show that a threat from homegrown terrorism of jihadist inspiration does exist in the US. The wave of arrests and thwarted plots recently seen in the US has severely undermined the long-held assumption that American Muslims, unlike their European counterparts, are virtually immune to radicalisation. In reality, as argued in this ARI, evidence also existed before the autumn of 2009, highlighting how radicalisation affected some small segments of the American Muslim population exactly like it affects some fringe pockets of the Muslim population of each European country. After putting forth this argument, this paper analyses the five concurring reasons traditionally used to explain the divergence between the levels of radicalisation in Europe and the US: better economic conditions, lack of urban ghettoes, lower presence of recruiting networks, different demographics and a more inclusive sense of citizenship. While all these characteristics still hold true, they no longer represent a guarantee, as other factors such as perception of discrimination and frustration at US foreign policies could lead to radicalisation. Finally, the paper looks at the post- 9 / 11 evolution of the <b>homegrown</b> <b>terrorist</b> threat to the US homeland and examines possible future scenarios...|$|E

40|$|CHDS State/LocalAs {{a nation}} with the largest prison {{population}} in the world, the United States has all the ingredients for criminals, extremists, and religious radicals to collaborate in producing {{a new breed of}} <b>homegrown</b> <b>terrorist.</b> Although there are documented cases where homegrown prison converts have conducted or provided material support for terrorist operations both domestically and internationally, the phenomenon is still a relatively new concern for U. S. homeland security. This thesis uses survey and interview methodologies to assess the opinions of correctional officers and experts as to the extent of the problem, as well as identifying gaps in intelligence, training, and strategy. The results suggest that prisons are fertile recruiting grounds for disaffected inmates that may be influenced by charismatic extremists acting under the guise of religion or politics. However, the results also point to a disconnect between corrections and other homeland security disciplines that prevents the creation of a robust information sharing environment. This study's conclusions indicate that a comprehensive and effective strategy cannot be developed without first acknowledging that the problem exists, understanding the rudimentary contributing factors, and initiating discussion on a multi-faceted approach to counter the radical influence.

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the topic of {{homegrown}} terrorism in the United States in the time period between the years 2001 and 2015. The first part of the thesis declares the diffe- rences betweeen domestic and homegrown terrorism, which in the Czech language exists un- der one term translatable as domestic terrorism. After setting these ground rules the definiti- on of the homegrown terrorism is determined. The next chapter then {{focuses on the}} two main types of homegrown terrorism and extremism, the jihadist and the right-wing, their ideological background and historical context. In the case of the right-wing terorrism the thesis also fo- cuses on the main types of right-wing extremism, which are based on racist, fundamental and anti-government ideology. The thesis also analyses the main terror attacks and plots from both jihadist and right-wing side, which were executed between the years 2001 - 2015. The final chapter of the thesis focuses on statistic data and it's analysis, which results into a comparison of the lethality and dangerousness of the two main types of homegrown terrorism, the creation of a profile of an average <b>homegrown</b> <b>terrorist</b> and overall analysis of the statistic data.
