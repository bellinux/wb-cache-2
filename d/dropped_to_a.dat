5|$|After {{a rather}} lengthy lull punctuated by only Tropical Depression Seven-E, a {{tropical}} wave formed Tropical Depression Eight-E on August 21. Initially taking a westward track, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Fausto on August 22. It {{turned to the}} west-northwest and stayed on that path {{for the next six}} days. Fausto steadily strengthened and intensified into a hurricane on August 22. It continued to intensify, peaking as a Category4 on August 24, and also substantially increased in size. The hurricane began to weaken thereafter, and was a minimal tropical storm by the time it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility on August 27. The tropical cyclone <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> depression and degenerated into a non-convective swirl of clouds on August 28.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{membership}} <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> low of 11,000 in 155 squadrons and the Air Cadet program {{underwent a}} transformation {{to reflect the}} changing needs of Canada and the cadets. The Air Cadet League introduced awards for proficiency and loyalty to the squadrons, summer courses were offered at RCAF stations, and a flying scholarship course was developed. To date, more than 15,000 cadets have received their private pilot licence through the scholarship course. Training shifted {{to be focused on}} the development of citizenship and an interest in aviation. Interest was renewed; by 1961, 332 squadrons were in existence and in 1972, authority was given for membership of up to 28,000 cadets.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s the Society's {{membership}} had <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> few dozen, {{and under the}} control of a new warden it invited Knight to return to the group in order to help promote it. Knight agreed, leaving his own lodge to publish two works by Fortune based on her material in the Society's archive, and authoring a biography of her. The 1990s saw a number of pioneering biographical studies of Fortune, including Alan Richardson's in 1991 and Janine Chapman's in 1993. Richardson's book relied heavily on the recollections of Christine Hartley, while the publication of Fielding and Carr was based upon the authors' interactions with older members of the Society. However, in 2007 Graf noted that Fortune had yet to receive much scholarly attention.|$|E

5|$|Foale's Increment {{proceeded}} fairly normally until June 25, when a resupply ship {{collided with}} solar arrays on the Spektr module {{during the second}} test of the Progress manual docking system, TORU. The module's outer shell was hit and holed, which caused the station to lose pressure. This was the first on-orbit depressurization {{in the history of}} spaceflight. The crew quickly cut cables leading to the module and closed Spektr's hatch in order to prevent the need to abandon the station in their Soyuz lifeboat. Their efforts stabilized the station's air pressure, whilst the pressure in Spektr, containing many of Foale's experiments and personal effects, <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> vacuum. Fortunately, food, water and other vital supplies were stored in other modules, and salvage and replanning effort by Foale and the science community minimized the loss of research data and capability.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Bud was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} and second named tropical cyclone of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. It formed as a tropical depression on July 10, {{to the south of}} the southern tip of Baja California. Shortly after, it became a tropical storm, and soon after the storm began to develop an eye. It began to intensify rapidly and was upgraded to a hurricane on July 11. Bud reached its peak intensity on July 13, becoming a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale at its peak. After reaching cooler waters and an unfavorable environment, the hurricane rapidly weakened and <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression status on July 15. The system continued to lose its convection and eventually degenerated by the next day. As the storm remained away from land, no effects were reported as a tropical cyclone, though its remnant brought precipitation to Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|In early February 1986 {{ten inches}} (254mm) of rain {{fell on the}} Sacramento region in 11 days, melting the Sierra Nevada snowpack and causing a huge flood to pour down the American River. The 1986 floods {{were some of the}} most severe {{recorded}} in the 20th century; Placer County was quickly designated a Federal Disaster Area. Rampaging streams and rivers incurred some $7.5 million in damages within the county. The rating for Sacramento's levees, supposedly designed to prevent a 125-year flood, was <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 78-year flood in studies conducted after the 1986 event, which suggested that such weather occurred more frequently than previously believed. The floods tore out levees along the Sacramento and Feather Rivers through the Sacramento Valley, and the city of Sacramento was spared by a close margin. Folsom Lake filled to dangerously high levels with runoff from the North, Middle and South Forks of the American River.|$|E

5|$|Also {{during his}} senior year, James was the {{centerpiece}} of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing LeBron's future earning power as a professional athlete. This prompted {{an investigation by the}} Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the gift from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source. Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in him being stripped of his high school sports eligibility. James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season. In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.|$|E
5|$|Sanchez {{started his}} first regular season NFL {{game against the}} Houston Texans on September 13, 2009, {{throwing}} his first touchdown pass, a 30-yard reception, to wide receiver Chansi Stuckey. Sanchez and the Jets won the game 24–7, with Sanchez throwing for 272 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. He was named the Pepsi Rookie of the Week for his performance in the game, {{the first of three}} consecutive Rookie of the Week awards. He played his first home game a week later versus the New England Patriots, a 16–9 victory; it was also his first AFC East division game and his first rivalry game. It was the Jets' first victory over New England at home since 2000. With a 24–17 victory over the Tennessee Titans in Week 3, Sanchez became the first rookie quarterback in NFL history to start and win his first three games of an NFL season. However, his performance began to regress as he had a pass intercepted for a 99-yard touchdown return, and fumbled another attempted pass in the end zone for another touchdown, as the Jets fell to the New Orleans Saints in Week 4. These two plays were enough to spoil an otherwise strong outing from the Jets's defensive unit as the team <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 3–1 record. Following the loss to New Orleans, Sanchez received criticism in a 16–13 overtime loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 6 when he threw five interceptions against a lowly Bills defense that previously had only four interceptions all season long. The Jets ended their losing streak in a 38–0 victory against the Oakland Raiders in Week 7 however, Sanchez was criticized after he was seen eating a hot dog on the Jets' bench in the fourth quarter.|$|E
5|$|The Fujiwhara {{interaction}} had {{a significant}} impact on the track of Humberto, which made a quick turn to the northwest, and then to the north-northwest, early on August 25. The interaction came to an end that afternoon as Humberto completed the northerly turn, while remaining a Category2 hurricane in the tropical waters of the central Atlantic. It began to gradually weaken on August 26 due to an increase in southwesterly shear from a nearby upper-level low as it maintained a north-northwest track. The slow weakening trend continued into August 27 as the eye became intermittent in the moderate-shear environment, which was once again affected by the outflow of Iris to the southwest. That evening, it <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> minimal hurricane with 75mph (120km/h) winds, which was later confirmed to have been the low point. Operationally, Humberto was downgraded to a tropical storm for a while on August 28, but was later confirmed to have been underestimated. As it tracked away from Iris and into a more open environment, it turned more to the north-northeast and slowly re-intensified again on August 29. Its movement was now affected by an incoming mid-latitude trough that turned Humberto northeast early on August 30. Humberto reached its second intensity peak of 90mph (145km/h) at that time.|$|E

This {{was the first time}} Harrisburg had been without a cinema since 1920. After release of the 2010 census, in February 2011, the city learned that its population had <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> low of 9,017 people, an 8.5 percent decrease. It was the lowest population since the pre-coal boom of 1900. Harrisburg also suffered from numerous scandals involving the school district and police department. In 2011, the Chief Deputy of the Saline County Sheriffs Department was sentenced to prison for sexually abusing a high school student who was working as an intern. The biggest hit was in late February 2012, an EF4 tornado hit Harrisburg during the 2012 Leap Day tornado outbreak. The southern part of the city was heavily damaged, with houses and businesses destroyed, many of which were completely leveled. Eight people were killed and 110 were injured by that tornado. In November 2012 a decision was made to close Willow Lake Mine, one of the last remaining mines in Saline County, putting 400 employees out of work.|$|E
