Goat <b>dung</b> <b>manure</b> (organic fertilizer) and NPKMg 12 - 12 - 17 - 2 (inorganic fertilizer) were evaluated at three rate (0, 28 and 56 g) per seedling.

Thus, the profile of lignocellulolytic enzymes produced during different phases of cultivation of Pleurotus HK- 37 on sisal waste fractions supplemented with cow <b>dung</b> <b>manure</b> was determined. Mushroom cultivation was performed in plastic bags using substrates formulated by mixing various proportions of sisal leaf residues and sisal boles and supplementing with cow <b>dung</b> <b>manure</b> on dry weight basis. A total of three hydrolytic (carboxymethyl cellulase, pectinase and xylanase) and two oxidative (laccase and lignin peroxidase) enzymes produced by Pleurotus HK- 37 were analyzed.

The study suggests that 5 % RM with biowastes preferably SS {{may be used to}} enhance phytoremediation potential of lemongrass...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to evaluate effects of phosphorous fertilizer (PF) s from sources of triple superphosphate (TSP) and di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and organic fertilizer (OF) s from sources of cow <b>dung</b> <b>manure</b> (CDM) and municipal solid waste compost (MSWC) on phosphorous (P) fractions include aluminium-P (Al-P), iron-P (Fe-P), Reductant soluble-P (RS-P), calcium-P (Ca-P) and avail-able-P (Olsen-P) fractions under rice cultivation condition. The trials were carried out in calcareous and acidic soils. PFs were added at three levels (10, 20 and 30 mg kg- 1) and OFs was applied at the rate of 10 t. ha- 1. Results of this study showed that Ca-P was the predominant form of P in calcareous soil while Fe-P and Al-P were predominate in acidic soils. In calcareous soil, all forms of P under submerged conditions had been increased because of using PFs both alone and in combination with OFs. In acidic soil, significant amounts of P fractions were found only in Fe-P and RS-P fractions. Accordingly, Fe-P fraction increased in 10 mg kg- 1 treatment and RS-P increased in MSWC treatment. Among the inorganic P fractions in calcareous soil, only RS-P; and in acidic soil, Ca-P and Fe-P significantly correlated to Olsen-P...|$|R
3000|$|Catha edulis, {{commonly}} called as khat or chat is an evergreen plant cultivated in Ethiopia for its stimulant leaves. The young leaves are chewed {{as a part}} of social recreation and the older leaves along with the twigs are discarded. This forms the major part of municipal solid waste that is dumped in large quantity in Harar region. The present study was carried in Haramaya University, Ethiopia to decompose the khat wastes along with crop residues and different animal <b>manures</b> (cow <b>dung,</b> goat <b>manure,</b> poultry manure and swine manure) using the earthworm Eisenia foetida.|$|R

(Diptera: Muscidae) collected in human feces, cattle liver, chicken viscera, cattle <b>dung,</b> chicken <b>manure</b> and food leftovers in Itumbiara, State of Goiás, Brazil, from July 1999 to July 2003, were studied. The pupae {{were obtained by}} the flotation method. They were individually placed in gelatin capsules until {{the emergence of the}} adult flies or their parasitoids. The overall prevalence of parasitism was 0. 7 %. The most frequent species was Pachycrepoideus vindemiae (Rondani) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), accounting for 35. 4 %...|$|R
40|$|A dynamic bio-economic {{model is}} used to examine natural {{resource}} use, the resulting nutrient balances and economic outcomes in a poor country under a range of technological and policy intervention scenarios. With limited technological intervention over a twelve year planning period, incomes rise by 50 % from a very low base and average per ha nutrient balances stand at – 58 kgs for nitrogen,- 32 kgs for phosphorous and – 114 kgs for potassium. Associated soil losses are 31 tons per ha. With a set of new technologies involving use of new high yielding crop varieties, agro-forestry, animal manure and inorganic fertilizers, construction of a communal drain to reduce water logging and some limited land user rights, results show a tenfold increase in incomes, 20 % decline in aggregate erosion levels {{and an increase in}} the dependence on livestock for <b>dung</b> <b>manure,</b> oxen draft, milk and ready cash over time. Moreover, a minimum daily calorie intake of 2000 per adult equivalent is met from on-farm outputs and per ha nutrient balances after intervention are as low as – 25 kgsN,- 14 kgsP and – 68 kgsK on the average. There is hence an obvious reduction in nutrient losses despite the higher reliance on the watershed for subsistence food requirements. The bias towards replenishment of nitrogen and phosphorous nutrients at the expense of potassiu...|$|R
40|$|A {{field was}} carried out on an ultisol in humid area of Edo State, Nigeria to {{evaluate}} the effects of plant density and cattle <b>dung</b> <b>manure</b> application on soil nutrient status and okra pod yield. Treatments consisted of three levels of cow dung (0, 300 and 450 kg N ha- 1) and three plant densities (47, 619, 66, 666 and 83, 333 plants per hectare (pph)). A 3 x 3 factorial arrangement fitted into randomized complete block design and replicated three times. Data were collected on soil chemical properties and pod yield of okra. Routine analysis of the soil indicated that the soil was low in nutrient content, thus addition of cattle dung to the soil at various levels influenced the soil nutrient status positively. After cropping with okra, cattle dung application had significant influenced on soil pH, total N, available P and exchangeable Na. Higher plant densities had no significant effect on soil chemical properties except available P which increase as it increased. The highest pod yield (7. 39 t ha- 1) and relative yield efficiency (RYE) (4. 39) were obtained from treatment combination of 83, 333 pph and 450 kg N ha- 1. However, integration of 83, 333 and 300 kg N ha- 1 had the optimum pod yield (7. 13 t ha- 1) and RYE (4. 22) ...|$|R

40|$|A field {{experiment}} was conducted during 2008 - 09 and 2009 - 10 {{to study the}} effect of different bio-fertilizersnamely PSB, Nitrate fixers and KM along with Vermicompost (2 tha- 1), NPK (30 : 30 : 15 kg ha- 1) and organicmanures (cow dung @ 20 t ha- 1) on growth behavior of coriander. There were 9 treatments with 3 replications. Combined inoculation of biofertilizers along with vermicompost and NPK (T 6) showed superiority with respectto plant height both at 45 DAS (40. 80 cm) and at maturity (63. 96 cm), number of primary (7. 42) and secondarybranches (13. 07), stem girth (3. 37 cm), root length (14. 39 cm) followed by T 3 treatment (Azospirillum +Vermicompost + NPK) where the plant height, number of primary and secondary branches, stem girth and rootlength were 63. 09 cm, 7. 35, 12. 22, 3. 27 cm and 14. 05 cm respectively. Treatment T 6 also exhibited earliness for 50 % flowering (61. 66) and seed setting (79. 49), days for fruit setting (96. 79) and maturity (103. 96). Seed yieldwas also obtained higher with T 6 (13. 34 tha- 1) followed by T 3 (13. 06 tha- 1), and was obtained lowest (6. 19 tha- 1) when plants were raised with cow <b>dung</b> <b>manure.</b> The use of bio-fertilizers is therefore recommended as anapproach to integrated nutrient management for better yield in coriander and sustenance of soil health...|$|R
