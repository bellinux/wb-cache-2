5|$|Distinguishing {{features}} of the teleosts are mobile premaxilla, elongated neural arches {{at the end of}} the caudal fin and unpaired basibranchial toothplates. The premaxilla is unattached to the neurocranium (braincase); it plays a role in protruding the mouth and creating a circular opening. This lowers the pressure inside the mouth, sucking the prey inside. The lower jaw and maxilla are then pulled back to close the mouth, and the fish is able to grasp the prey. By contrast, mere closure of the jaws would risk pushing food out of the mouth. In more advanced teleosts, the premaxilla is enlarged and has teeth, while the maxilla is toothless. The maxilla functions to push both the premaxilla and the lower <b>jaw</b> <b>forward.</b> To open the mouth, an adductor muscle pulls back the top of the maxilla, pushing the lower <b>jaw</b> <b>forward.</b> In addition, the maxilla rotates slightly, which pushes forward a bony process that interlocks with the premaxilla.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Edmonds Technique". While tensing {{the soft}} palate (the soft tissue {{at the back}} of the roof of the mouth) and throat muscles and pushing the <b>jaw</b> <b>forward</b> and down, do a Valsalva maneuver.|$|E
2500|$|Voluntary {{opening of}} the eustachian tubes: Voluntary {{opening of the}} tubes: Voluntary Tubal Opening:(French: béance tubaire volontaire (BTV) [...] ) is a method of {{equalising}} or clearing the ears described by doctor Georges Delonca and used in scuba diving and freediving. It aims to rebalance the pressure between the external ear and middle ear.The subject must either exercise a voluntary control of the tensor veli palatini muscles opening the eustachian tubes, or move the jaw to open the tubes when necessary. Another description of the method is to tense {{the muscles of the}} soft palate and the throat while pushing the <b>jaw</b> <b>forward</b> and down as if starting to yawn. This should pull the eustachian tubes open.This is less easy to execute than the Valsalva maneuver, but the BTV is the gentlest method to clear the ears. However, not all divers can perform this maneuver. It may be necessary to engage in ear training exercises to train the muscles to perform this maneuver.*: Some people are able to voluntarily hold their Eustachian tubes open continuously for a period of several seconds to minutes. The 'clicking your ears' can actually be heard if one puts one's ear to another person's ear for them to hear the clicking sound. Those that are borderline on learning this voluntary control first discover this via yawning or swallowing or other means; which after practice can be done deliberately without force even when there are no pressure issues involved. When the Eustachian Tubes are deliberately held open, one's voice sounds louder in one's head than when they are closed.|$|E
50|$|He {{concluded}} that skull and facial features were clues to genetic criminality, {{and that these}} features could be measured with craniometers and calipers with the results developed into quantitative research. A few of the 14 identified traits of a criminal included large <b>jaws,</b> <b>forward</b> projection of <b>jaw,</b> low sloping forehead; high cheekbones, flattened or upturned nose; handle-shaped ears; hawk-like noses or fleshy lips; hard shifty eyes; scanty beard or baldness; insensitivity to pain; long arms, and so on.|$|R
500|$|Since {{it is not}} a fast swimmer, {{the goblin}} shark may be an ambush predator. Its low-density flesh and large oily liver make it {{neutrally}} buoyant, allowing it to drift towards its prey with minimal motions so as to avoid detection. Once prey comes into range, the shark's specialized <b>jaws</b> can snap <b>forward</b> to capture it. The protrusion of the jaw is assisted by two pairs of elastic ligaments associated with the mandibular joint, which are pulled taut when the jaws are in their normal retracted position; when the shark bites, the ligaments release their tension and essentially [...] "catapult" [...] the <b>jaws</b> <b>forward.</b> At the same time, the well-developed basihyal (analogous to a tongue) {{on the floor of the}} mouth drops, expanding the oral cavity and sucking in water and prey.|$|R
6000|$|My ape-like {{companion}} trotted {{along by}} my side, {{with his hands}} hanging down and his <b>jaw</b> thrust <b>forward.</b> I wondered what memory he might have in him. [...] "How {{long have you been}} on this island?" [...] said I.|$|R
6000|$|The {{voice was}} not unkindly, {{although}} the speaker had thrown his lower <b>jaw</b> <b>forward</b> {{as if to}} pronounce the word [...] "pup" [...] with a humorous suggestion of a mastiff.

60|$|For {{a moment}} {{then she did}} look death {{straight}} and calmly in the face, for it was death that looked on her through those blood-shot eyes. He had thrust his lower <b>jaw</b> <b>forward,</b> his teeth, large and yellow, looked like the fangs of a wolf; stertorous breathing escaped his nostrils, and his distorted fingers were working convulsively, like the claws of a beast when it sees its prey.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} dinosaurs, psittacosaurs had akinetic skulls: {{that is to}} say, {{the upper and lower}} jaws each behaved as a single unit, without {{internal}} joints. The only joint was the jaw joint itself, and psittacosaurs could slide their lower <b>jaws</b> <b>forward</b> and backward on the joint, permitting a shearing action. Unlike most ceratopsians, their beaks did not form curved tips, but were instead rounded and flattened. If the jaws were aligned, the beaks could be used to crop objects, but if the lower jaw was retracted so that the lower beak was inside the upper beak, the jaws may have served a nutcracking function. A nut- or seed-rich diet would also match well with the gastroliths often seen in well-preserved psittacosaur skeletons.|$|R
5000|$|Simorhinella (meaning [...] "little pug-nose" [...] in Greek) is an extinct genus of therocephalian therapsid {{from the}} Late Permian of South Africa. It is known {{from a single}} species, Simorhinella baini, named by South African {{paleontologist}} Robert Broom in 1915. Broom named it {{on the basis of}} a single fossil collected by the British Museum of Natural History in 1878 that included the skull and <b>jaws</b> <b>forward</b> from the eye sockets. The skull is unusual in that it has an extremely short and deep snout, unlike the longer and lower snouts of most other therocephalians. Because of the skull's distinctiveness, the classification of Simorhinella within Therocephalia is uncertain. However, a 2014 study proposed that it was closely related to the basal therocephalian Lycosuchus, placing it in the family Lycosuchidae.|$|R
50|$|According to {{the breed}} standard, the Leavitt Bulldog {{has a large}} head (the {{circumference}} of the head is at least equal to the dog’s height at the withers), with powerful jaw muscles. The lower <b>jaw</b> extends <b>forward.</b> The back and chest are wide and muscular. The tail is straight, and reaches the hocks.|$|R

50|$|Unlike CPAP, oral {{pressure}} therapy {{does not}} apply pressure directly to the airway, but applies light negative pressure in the oral cavity. With this system, the user breathes normally through the nose with the mouth closed. Unlike mandibular repositioning devices (also known as oral appliances and dental devices), oral pressure therapy does not pull the lower <b>jaw</b> <b>forward.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{sleep apnea}} oral {{appliance}} is typically molded {{to fit a}} particular patient's teeth by a dentist specializing in treating sleep disorders. Appliances usually function by moving the lower <b>jaw</b> <b>forward</b> in order {{to open up the}} airway during sleep, thus promoting better breathing and less apneas. Some oral appliances restrict tongue movement in order to prevent the tongue from blocking the airway.|$|E

5|$|The viper dogfish feeds {{primarily}} on bony fishes, notably lanternfishes in the genera Benthosema and Diaphus, and also takes crustaceans. Its long jaws and slender teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting, {{in contrast to}} the short jaws and saw-like lower teeth of other dogfish sharks that are suited for excising chunks of meat. Prey is seized by a rapid extension of the jaws and swallowed whole; the shark can consume fish close to 40% as long as itself. The viper dogfish is the only dogfish species that lacks a suborbital muscle, which is normally responsible for pulling the <b>jaws</b> <b>forward</b> when biting. <b>Jaw</b> protrusion is instead effected by the hyomandibular bone, which is articulated to the skull in a manner that allows it to swing down and forward. This unique arrangement serves to increase the distance the shark can protrude its jaws, as well as the size of its gape both vertically and horizontally.|$|R
5000|$|Physiognomy {{claimed a}} {{correlation}} between physical features (especially facial features) and character traits. It was made famous by Cesare Lombroso (1835-1909), the founder of anthropological criminology, {{who claimed to be}} able to scientifically identify links between the nature of a crime and the personality or physical appearance of the offender. The originator of the concept of a [...] "born criminal" [...] and arguing in favor of biological determinism, Lombroso tried to recognize criminals by measurements of their bodies. He concluded that skull and facial features were clues to genetic criminality and that these features could be measured with craniometers and calipers with the results developed into quantitative research. A few of the 14 identified traits of a criminal included large <b>jaws,</b> <b>forward</b> projection of <b>jaw,</b> low sloping forehead; high cheekbones, flattened or upturned nose; handle-shaped ears; hawk-like noses or fleshy lips; hard shifty eyes; scanty beard or baldness; insensitivity to pain; long arms, and so on.|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} season usually occurs between August and December and gestation is about 165 to 190 days. When courting, potential mates will use facial expressions {{to indicate that}} {{they are ready to}} copulate. One will thrust its <b>jaw</b> <b>forward,</b> shake its head, and raise and lower its eyebrows. The other will then respond with the same action. This may be repeated several times. The female then presents herself to the male.|$|E
50|$|The John Dory catches prey by {{stalking}} it, then extending its <b>jaw</b> <b>forward</b> in a tube-like {{structure to}} suck {{the fish in}} with some water. The water then flows out through the gills; the pre-maxillary bone, the only tooth-bearing bone in this fish, is used to grind the food. The John Dory is primarily a piscivore; it eats a variety of fish, especially schooling fish such as sardines. Occasionally it eats squid and cuttlefish.|$|E
50|$|The {{appliance}} normally {{consists of}} a frame or a center bars that are strapped to the patient's head during a fitting appointment. The frame has a section which is positioned {{in front of the}} patient's mouth, which allows for the attachment of elastic or rubber bands directly into the mouth area. These elastics are then hooked onto the patient's braces (brackets and bands) or appliance fitted in his or her mouth. This creates a forward pulling force to pull the upper <b>jaw</b> <b>forward.</b>|$|E
50|$|Longjawed galaxias are {{slender and}} elongate, having {{coloration}} consisting of spots and indistinct bands of various shades of brown and grey. The single dorsal and anal fins are about {{two thirds of}} the way along the body. Like all galaxiids it lacks scales and has a thick, leathery skin covered with mucus. The lower <b>jaw</b> is <b>forward</b> of the upper, giving rise to its common name.|$|R
50|$|The wimple piranha reaches about 15 cm (6.5 in) in {{standard}} length. The curve of its large, banana-shaped lower jaw creates a distinctive protuberance; this gave this fish the specific name mento, which means 'chin'. Its reduced, conical teeth {{on the upper}} <b>jaw</b> project <b>forward</b> when the <b>jaws</b> are closed. The wimple piranha has 62 chromosomes, {{which is more than}} average for related fishes (60 chromosomes).|$|R
50|$|Stevens-Costello embouchure has {{its origins}} in the William Costello embouchure and was further {{developed}} by Roy Stevens. It uses a slight rolling in of both lips and touching evenly all the way across. It also uses mouthpiece placement of about 40-50% top lip and 50-60% lower lip. The teeth will be about 1/4 to 1/2 in apart and the teeth are parallel or the <b>jaw</b> slightly <b>forward.</b>|$|R
50|$|An oral appliance, often {{referred}} to as a mandibular advancement splint, is a custom-made mouthpiece that shifts the lower <b>jaw</b> <b>forward</b> and opens the bite slightly, opening up the airway. These devices can be fabricated by a general dentist. Oral appliance therapy (OAT) is usually successful in patients with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea. While CPAP is more effective for sleep apnea than oral appliances, oral appliances do improve sleepiness and quality of life and are often better tolerated than CPAP.|$|E
50|$|The {{photo is}} of an {{orthodontic}} extra-oral appliance commonly known as a face-mask or a reverse pull headgear. This specific design is a Delaire type face-mask and is fitted to the patient's face, between 14 and 16 hours a day, during this treatment phase. The mask attaches to the patients upper jaw, typically, with braces fitted, using elastic bands (shown). This pulls the upper <b>jaw</b> <b>forward</b> while it is growing to correct a Class III malocclusion. The elastics also effectively hold the mask in place, on the patent's face.|$|E
50|$|This douc {{has been}} rarely {{observed}} in the wild and very {{little is known about}} its wild mating and breeding habits. Before mating, both genders give a sexual signal with the <b>jaw</b> <b>forward,</b> eyebrows raised and then lowered, and a head-shake. The female makes the first move, lying face-down on a branch, eyeing her chosen mate by looking over her shoulder. The male returns with a stare and may turn to look at another spot he considers more suitable for mating. Single-mount and multiple-mount matings have been reported.|$|E
50|$|Other {{forms of}} {{headgear}} treat reverse overjets, {{in which the}} top <b>jaw</b> is not <b>forward</b> enough. It {{is similar to a}} facemask, also attached to braces, and encourages forward growth of the upper jaw.|$|R
50|$|Truteal, Terebradens tubauris: a nocturnal, eyeless soricomorph {{with large}} ears, {{a large number}} of sensory whiskers, and incisors on both the lower and upper <b>jaws,</b> {{extended}} <b>forward</b> to form a structure like a bird beak, which acts as probe to catch earthworms and burrowing insects in soft earth and leaf litter. It has an overall length of about 12 centimeters. Like the lutie, the truteal's predators include the owl-like birds of prey.|$|R
5|$|The {{leopard shark}} captures prey by {{expanding}} its buccal cavity {{to create a}} suction force, which is facilitated by its labial cartilages swinging forward to form the mouth into a tube. Simultaneously, the shark protrudes its <b>jaws</b> <b>forward</b> to grip the prey between its teeth. As with other sharks, {{the teeth of the}} leopard shark are periodically shed and replaced; it takes 9ndash&12 days for a replacement tooth to move into position. Leopard sharks have been caught with stomachs filled with clam siphons, which the sharks seize before the clams can retract and break off with a levering motion of their bodies. On occasion, the shark tears the entire clam body out of its shell this way. Other sharks examined have had stomachs containing whole innkeeper worms with no bite marks, suggesting that the sharks sucked them out of their burrows. Under a hollow bridge support in San Francisco Bay, a group of leopard sharks and spiny dogfish have been observed feeding on a dense school of anchovies by slowly swimming counterclockwise through the clockwise-swimming school, and swallowing any anchovies that accidentally entered their open mouths.|$|R
