5|$|Small-scale {{wind power}} is the name given to wind {{generation}} systems with the capacity to produce up to 50kW of electrical power. Isolated communities, that may otherwise rely on diesel generators, may use wind turbines as an alternative. Individuals may purchase these systems to reduce or eliminate their dependence on grid electric power <b>for</b> <b>economic</b> <b>reasons,</b> or to reduce their carbon footprint.

The German Command considered it important to maintain control over the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland to ease the situation in Finland and keep the Soviet Baltic Fleet trapped in the eastern bay of the gulf.

5|$|During the 1930s, a {{combination}} of developments, from the Great Depression to the vicious spiral of OUN terrorist attacks and government pacifications, caused government relations with the national minorities to deteriorate. Unrest among national minorities was also related to foreign policy. Troubles followed repressions in largely Ukrainian-populated eastern Galicia, where nearly 1,800 persons were arrested. Tension also arose {{between the government and}} Poland's German minority, particularly in Upper Silesia. The government did not yield to calls for antisemitic measures; but the Jews (8.6% of Poland's population) grew discontented <b>for</b> <b>economic</b> <b>reasons</b> that were connected with the depression. Overall, by the end of Piłsudski's life, his government's relations with national minorities were increasingly problematic.|$|E
5|$|Jose Brandao, a {{historian}} specializing in North American Native history, suggests that contemporary {{analyses of the}} Lachine Massacre continue to demonstrate cultural bias. Brandao criticizes historians Parkman, Charles McIlwain, and George Hunt for citing the growing dependence on European goods (which were, according to these historians, viewed by the Iroquois as superior to other goods) {{as a reason for}} Iroquois dissatisfaction and violence. Brandao dismisses this theory as a largely ethnocentric interpretation with little evidence to support it. Brandao also dismisses Hunt’s suggestion that natives, similar to the Europeans, waged wars <b>for</b> <b>economic</b> <b>reasons.</b>|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the conquest of Egypt in 30 BCE regular {{commerce}} began between the Romans and Asia, marked by the Roman appetite for silk cloth coming from the Far East, which was then resold to the Romans by the Parthians.

5|$|Under the Mint Act of 1792, the largest-denomination coin was {{the gold}} eagle, or ten-dollar piece. Also struck were a half eagle ($5) and quarter eagle ($2.50). Bullion flowed {{out of the}} United States <b>for</b> <b>economic</b> <b>reasons</b> {{for much of the}} late 18th and early 19th centuries. The eagle's size made it {{convenient}} for use in international transactions, and, faced with the likelihood that most being struck were exported, the Director of the Mint Elias Boudinot ended its production in 1804. In 1838, coinage resumed after Congress revised the weight and fineness of American gold coins. The new eagle was struck to a design by Christian Gobrecht, {{who was one of the}} Mint's engravers.|$|E
5|$|The fourth part, The Shadow Side, {{looks at}} {{what happens to}} debtors and {{creditors}} when debts are not re-paid. Some debts that are a matter of honour to which the debtor must repay by an equivalent value or creditor must either forgive or exact revenge. Debts to society, after committing crimes, are paid through vengeance-based imprisonment. The United Kingdom had debtors' prison for {{those who could not}} pay, but this was abolished <b>for</b> <b>economic</b> <b>reasons</b> as it prevented labourers from working and had a burdensome cost of operation. Other societies used the services of their family members or themselves as collateral. Sometimes the debtors overthrew the creditors, like King Philip IV of France against the Knights Templar, or the Ugandans against the Asians. Atwood applies the trickle-down economics to debt and examines the psychology side through the Jungian Shadow.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, the Indian Army {{could call}} upon 491,000men, {{but there was}} a {{shortage}} of experienced officers, most of the officers having been killed or wounded in the war. In 1921, the Indian government started a review of their military requirements with the protection of the North West Frontier and internal security their priority. By 1925, the Army in India had been reduced to 197,000troops, 140,000of them Indian. Battalions were now allocated one of three roles: The field army of four infantry divisions and five cavalry brigades; covering troops, 12 infantry brigades and supporting arms to act as a reserve force in case of invasion; and finally internal security troops, 43infantry battalions to aid the civil power and support the field army when required. The number of cavalry regiments was reduced from 39 to 21. The infantry regiments were converted into 20large regiments with four or five battalions in each regiment plus a training battalion, always numbered the 10th, also included were ten Gurkha regiments. Nine single battalion regiments were disbanded by 1922. Two of the large regiments were later disbanded, the 3rd Madras Regiment <b>for</b> <b>economic</b> <b>reasons,</b> and the 20th Burma Rifles when Burma ceased to be governed by India.|$|E
