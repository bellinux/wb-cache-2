40|$|Insulin pump therapy [continuous {{subcutaneous}} insulin infusion (CSII) ] requires regular {{change of}} <b>infusion</b> <b>sets</b> every 2 - 3 days {{in order to}} minimize the risk of skin irritations or other adverse events. This has been discussed to be a potential burden to the environment. The purpose of this analysis was to perform an environmental assessment of insulin pump <b>infusion</b> <b>sets</b> based on loss of resources occurring during incineration of the discarded products and by means of a lifecycle concept used to weight a material in relation to its rareness on earth and its consumption. In addition to five <b>infusion</b> <b>sets</b> (Inset 30, InsetII, Comfort, Quick-set, and Cleo), a patch pump (Omnipod) was also included in this analysis. The annual loss in waste of the so called “person reserve” of 3 days of catheter use was compared with daily consumption of {{a cup of coffee in}} a disposable paper cup and to a soft drink in an aluminum can. The weight-based loss in resources through waste for the <b>infusion</b> <b>sets</b> (except for Cleo) corresponded to 70 - 200 % of the loss of resources for a coffee cup (Cleo, 320 %; Omnipod, 1, 821, 600 %) and to 1 - 3 % of the loss from an aluminum soft drink can (Cleo, 5 %; Omnipod, 31, 200 %). The loss or resources by use of <b>infusion</b> <b>sets</b> used in insulin pump therapy appears to be low and is similar to the burden induced by the uptake of one cup of coffee per day. The loss or resources with regular CSII is considerably lower than the loss or resources induced by patch pumps...|$|R

In practice, patients disconnect their insulin pumps from their <b>infusion</b> <b>sets</b> when showering, changing clothes, swimming, exercis-ing, or during intimate moments. Rang-ing in time from a fewminutes to several hours, these periods of interrupted in-sulin infusion result in cessation of basal insulin delivery.

2500|$|A {{standard}} IV <b>infusion</b> <b>set</b> {{consists of}} a pre-filled, sterile container (glass bottle, plastic bottle or plastic bag) of fluids with an attachment that allows the fluid to flow one drop at a time, {{making it easy to}} see the flow rate (and also reducing air bubbles); a long sterile tube with a clamp to regulate or stop the flow; a connector to attach to the access device; and Y-sets to allow [...] "piggybacking" [...] of another <b>infusion</b> <b>set</b> onto the same line, e.g., adding a dose of antibiotics to a continuous fluid drip.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the time}} comes to select an insulin pump, there are {{numerous}} options. The [...] "perfect" [...] pump varies by person. Factors such as weight, color, cost, canula insertion angles, special features, and easy usage {{play a vital role}} in the selection process. Patient factors relevant to <b>infusion</b> <b>set</b> selection include patient’s age, immune system function, body characteristics, activities, personal preferences, and history of diabetic ketoacidosis.|$|E
2500|$|Insulin {{pumps are}} drug {{delivery}} devices {{used to treat}} patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The Minimed Paradigm REAL-Time and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system, which received FDA clearance in 2006, uses tubing and a reservoir with rapid-acting insulin. This [...] "infusion set" [...] is patient-connected via a catheter to the abdomen region. The <b>infusion</b> <b>set</b> can remain in the place for 3 days while the pump is clip-belt worn. There is a quick-disconnect feature for the tubing. The pump delivers insulin in two modes. In Basal rate mode, the delivery is continuous in small doses similar to a pancreas, for example 0.15 units per hour throughout the day. Basal rates are set to meet individual metabolic rates. In Bolus mode, the delivery is programmed to be a one-time delivery prior to eating or after an unexpected high, for example 18 units spread out to several hours. This type of continuous treatment {{is in contrast to}} traditional multiple daily injections (MDI) that use slower-acting insulin. Continuous treatment reduces glucose variability.|$|E
50|$|The Omnipod {{system costs}} {{an average of}} 10 to 20% more than other systems, {{depending}} on how frequently patients change their <b>infusion</b> <b>sets.</b> Each initial unit costs over 640 U.S. dollars.|$|R
50|$|Both MDI and pumping {{can achieve}} {{similarly}} excellent glycemic control. Some people prefer injections {{because they are}} less expensive than pumps and do not require the wearing of a continually attached device. However, the clinical literature is very clear that patients whose basal insulin requirements tend not to vary throughout the day or do not require dosage precision smaller than 0.5 IU, are {{much less likely to}} realize much significant advantage of pump therapy. Another perceived advantage of pumps is the freedom from syringes and injections, however, <b>infusion</b> <b>sets</b> still require less frequent injections to guide <b>infusion</b> <b>sets</b> into the subcutaneous tissue.|$|R

50|$|The <b>infusion</b> <b>set</b> must be {{replaced}} regularly, usually every 2-3 days. Insulin absorption becomes less effective the longer the set is left in place, leading to poorer control of blood glucose. For this reason, {{the site of the}} <b>infusion</b> <b>set</b> is moved when the set is changed. Often a number of favorite sites for the <b>infusion</b> <b>set</b> are used on a rotation basis.|$|E
50|$|Indwelling {{catheters}} {{pose the}} risk of infection and ulceration, and some patients may also develop lipodystrophy due to the <b>infusion</b> <b>sets.</b> These risks can often be minimized by keeping infusion sites clean. Insulin pumps require care and effort to use correctly.|$|R
