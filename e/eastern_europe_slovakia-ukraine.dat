50|$|Serfdom reached <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> {{centuries later}} than Western Europe—it became {{dominant}} around the 15th century. Before that time, <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> {{had been much}} more sparsely populated than Western Europe, and the lords of <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> created a peasantry-friendly environment to encourage migration east. Serfdom developed in <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> after the Black Death epidemics of the mid-14th century, which stopped the eastward migration. The resulting high land-to-labour ratio - combined with <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe's</b> vast, sparsely populated areas - gave the lords an incentive to bind the remaining peasantry to their land. With increased demand for agricultural produce in Western Europe during the later era when Western Europe limited and eventually abolished serfdom, serfdom remained in force throughout <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> during the 17th century so that nobility-owned estates could produce more agricultural products (especially grain) for the profitable export market.|$|R

Furthermore, I present empirical evidence of the drivers of the new division of labor in Europe. I find among other things that falling trade costs and falling corruption levels as well as improvements in the contracting environment in <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> are affecting the level of intra-firm imports from <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe.</b> They are also favoring outsourcing over offshoring. Low organizational costs of hierarchies and large costs of hold-up (when there are no alternative investors in Old Europe or no alternative suppliers in <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe)</b> are favoring offshoring over outsourcing.

40|$|Historically, <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> has {{not been}} favorably treated in terms of quota growth in the European Community and U. S. markets - often quite the contrary. But the EC and U.

Erzan and Holmes argue that <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe's</b> expansion of relatively labor-intensive products has probably been inhibited byquotas and by the weak adjustment mechanisms inherent in a centrally planned economic system. If so, given market reforms in <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe,</b> exports of labor-intensive textiles and clothing should expand more than proportionately and the degree of specialization should increase if the Multi-Fibre Arrangement is abolished or its grip on <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe's</b> exports is relaxed in the EC.
