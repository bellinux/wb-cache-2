5|$|On November 2, 2002, U.S. Marine Corps Major Michael Brown {{attempted}} an {{indecent assault}} on a Filipina bartender in Okinawa, Japan. The bartender accused Brown of attempting to rape her and of throwing her cell phone into a nearby river; Brown denied the rape charges. The victim later recanted and attempted to withdraw the accusation, though prosecutors presented <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had received a cash payment just before doing so.|$|E
5|$|Queen Catherine {{remains one}} of the most {{important}} figures in the folk tradition and history of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Despite there being no <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was beatified, the Queen has long been venerated by Catholics in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is increasingly seen as an important transethnic state symbol.|$|E
5|$|In {{her early}} to mid-thirties, {{she became a}} lady-in-waiting (nyōbō) at court, most likely because of her {{reputation}} as an author. Chieko Mulhern writes in Japanese Women Writers, a Biocritical Sourcebook that scholars have wondered why Murasaki made such a move at a comparatively late period in her life. Her diary evidences that she exchanged poetry with Michinaga after her husband's death, leading to speculation that the two may have been lovers. Bowring sees no <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was brought to court as Michinaga's concubine, although he did bring her to court without following official channels. Mulhern thinks Michinaga wanted to have Murasaki at court to educate his daughter Shōshi.|$|E
50|$|Not much {{is known}} about Panna dhai's early life but there are <b>evidences</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> belonged to the Gujjar community. She was a maid of Rani Karnavati, wife of Maharana Sangram Singh. She also helped Rani Karnavti on {{political}} matters. Rani Karnavati had entrusted her with the upbringing of her sons, Vikramaditya Singh and infant Udai Singh.|$|R
50|$|Education: Richard Cobbold {{made her}} speak and write as a well-educated woman {{throughout}} the book although the <b>evidence</b> is <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was uneducated.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} get the patent, however, the {{inventor}} must submit a declaration supported by <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> he or <b>she</b> conceived of the invention before the third-party publication. The inventor must also provide <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> he or <b>she</b> was diligent in either reducing the invention to practice or in filing the patent application.|$|R
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the anti-Semitic passages in her memoir were intended to be used as <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was not Jewish; alternatively, she may have been influenced by Ezra Pound's anti-Semitic radio broadcasts. Whatever the case, she did help a Jewish couple escape Italy, providing passage on a ship to the United States. By {{the end of the war}} her sympathies had again changed, and she saw the Allies as liberators.|$|E
5|$|Susanne admits her {{deception}} but {{claims that}} she was scapegoated for trying to leave {{her job at the}} weapons facility. There, she had been working on ergotamine, an aerosolized gas that causes paranoia and anxiety. Susanne claims that the government plans to test the gas on civilians in Baltimore. After deciphering the file, the Lone Gunmen find {{that she was}} telling the truth, learning the location of the gas. Susanne also finds <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had a tracking device put in a tooth, which she pulls out.|$|E
5|$|Aigusta {{was baptized}} as Anastasia {{in order to}} marry Simeon of Russia in 1333; he became Grand Prince of Moscow in 1341. There is no direct <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was a {{daughter}} of Gediminas, but because the marriage was high-profile, most historians have concluded {{that she was a}} member of Gediminas' family. The marriage had great potential because Lithuania and Moscow were fierce rivals for supremacy in Ruthenia, but conflicts broke out again in 1335, just two years after the marriage. Her two sons Vasilei and Konstantin did not survive infancy; her daughter Vasilisa married Mikhail Vasilevich of Kashin, a Tverite prince opposing Lithuania. Her brother Jaunutis sought her help when he was deposed by Algirdas in 1345. Immediately before her death on 11 March 1345 Aigusta became a nun. She was buried within the Moscow Kremlin at a monastic church whose construction she had sponsored.|$|E
50|$|Sharon {{has since}} been {{revealed}} as a prisoner in the Raft, with <b>evidence</b> suggesting <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{is part of a}} plot to destabilize the Fantastic Four.|$|R
50|$|The Navy's extant records seem {{to contain}} no report of Agawams chase of Chesapeake. The Federal {{correspondence}} contains both statements maintaining <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did {{at least get}} underway and <b>evidence</b> indicating <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not.|$|R
50|$|As a National Historic Landmark, Fir was {{previously}} listed as being located in California and New York, but there's no other <b>evidence</b> suggesting <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was ever {{moved to the}} East coast.|$|R
5|$|Einstein's future wife, Mileva Marić, also {{enrolled}} at the Polytechnic that year. She {{was the only woman}} among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein and Marić's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest. In 1900, Einstein was awarded the Zürich Polytechnic teaching diploma, but Marić failed the examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component, theory of functions. There have been claims that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> made any substantive contributions.|$|E
5|$|Worried by the events, the {{hospital}} coordinator, Dr. Theresa Shannon, tells Mulder and Scully about a similar series of deaths that {{occurred at the}} same hospital ten years prior. They suspect Rebecca Waite (O-Lan Jones), a nurse who {{is the only person}} present at all the death scenes. The agents visit Waite's house, discovering <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> practices witchcraft; however, the audience learns that the evidence was planted there by a staff member of {{the hospital}}. Elsewhere, Dr. Jack Franklin (Richard Beymer) is non-fatally assaulted by Waite at his house. There, Waite is arrested and approached by the agents, who attempt to question Waite but are prevented when she starts to vomit pins, dying shortly thereafter. After the incident, Mulder visits Dr. Jack Franklin, hoping to learn more about Waite's possible motivation. Although Franklin is seemingly innocent, when Mulder leaves the room, he begins to levitate and devilishly smile. Later that night, Mulder deduces that the birthdays of all the victims match up with the dates of the Witches' Sabbath and that Waite was actually trying to protect the victims from Dr. Jack Franklin (she had placed the pentagramsactually protective symbolson and around the victims in the hopes of protecting them from dark magic). This also explains why Waite tried to kill Franklin. Unfortunately, Mulder also realizes that because Waite was not the murderer, the spree of murders will continue. And as he suspected, another patient is murdered with acid back at the hospital.|$|E
5|$|The {{contention}} that the scene depicts the festival for Athena is fraught with problems. Later sources indicate {{that a number of}} classes of individual who performed a role in the procession are not present in the frieze, these include: the hoplites, the allies in the Delian league, the skiaphoroi or umbrella bearers, the female hydraiphoroi (only male hydrai bearers are portrayed) thetes, slaves, metics, the panathenaic ship, and some would suggest the kanephoros, although there is <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is accounted for. That what we now see {{was meant to be a}} generic image of the religious festival is problematic since no other temple sculpture depicts a contemporary event involving mortals. Locating the scene in mythical or historical time has been the principal difficulty of the line of inquiry. John Boardman has suggested that the cavalry portray the heroization of the marathonomachoi, the hoplites who fell at Marathon in 490, and that, therefore these riders were the Athenians who took part in the last pre-war Greater Panathenaia. In support, he points out, the number of horsemen, chariot passengers (but not charioteers), grooms, and marshals comes to the same as the number Herodotos gives for the Athenian dead: 192. Equally suggestive of a reference to the Persian War, is the similarity several scholars have noted of the frieze to the Apadana sculpture in Persepolis. This has variously been posited to be democratic Athens counter posing itself to oriental tyranny, or, aristocratic Athens emulating the Imperial East. Further to this zeitgeist argument there is J.J. Politt’s {{contention that}} the frieze embodies a Periclean manifesto, which favours the cultural institutions of agones (or contests, as witnessed by the apobatai), sacrifices, and military training as well as a number of other democratic virtues. More recent scholarship pursuing this vein has made the frieze a site of ideological tension between the elite and the demos with perhaps, only the aristocracy present, and merely veiled reference to the ten tribes.|$|E
50|$|Mary Fleming did {{not receive}} the {{restoration}} of Lethington's estate and properties until 1581-82, by grant of King James VI. While there is some dispute about this, the <b>evidence</b> is <b>that</b> <b>she</b> never remarried.|$|R
50|$|There are claims <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{participated in}} the siege and capture of Pensacola in March 1781. However, {{documentary}} <b>evidence</b> suggests <b>that</b> <b>she</b> arrived in Philadelphia with cargo on 1 June 1780, and therefore could not have participated in this action in March 1781.|$|R

5|$|This {{major change}} in {{leadership}} solidified {{the power of the}} chancellor Yelü Yixin and his ally Yelü Renxian, a chancellor and military leader. When Yelü Renxian died in 1072, Yelü Yixin began to view Emperor Daozong's son and heir apparent, Prince Jun, as the only possible threat to Yelü Yixin's power, and set in motion plans to eliminate the prince. He first eliminated Prince Jun's mother, the emperor's wife, by fabricating <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had an affair with a palace musician. Believing Yelü Yixin's trap, Emperor Daozong ordered his wife to commit suicide. Yelü Yixin then fabricated a coup by implicating his own enemies within the court of planning to depose of Emperor Daozong and place Prince Jun on the throne. While the emperor was initially unmoved, Yelü Yixin eventually convinced him to exile his son by creating a false confession. Prince Jun was immediately exiled, at which point Yelü Yixin sent assassins to eliminate the prince and his wife, preventing both the prince from being returned to power and Yelü Yixin's plot from being discovered. Yelü Yixin's treachery was eventually discovered when, in 1079, he attempted to convince the emperor to leave the new heir at the palace during a hunting trip. When other members of the court protested that the young boy would be in mortal peril if left behind with Yelü Yixin, the emperor finally saw through Yelü Yixin. By 1080 Yelü Yixin was stripped of his rank and sent to a low-ranking post outside of the capital. Shortly afterwards he was executed.|$|E
25|$|Maria Monk (1816–1849), {{sometimes}} {{considered an}} apostate of the Catholic Church, {{though there is}} little <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> ever was a Catholic.|$|E
25|$|There is <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> and the Prince {{favored the}} more prestigious Parisian {{restaurants}} with their patronage. Specifically, the great chef Escoffier named both Oeufs à la Chimay and Poularde Chimay after Princess Clara.|$|E
50|$|Riots and unrest are {{breaking}} {{out all over}} India and Khan, a non religious Muslim, predicts bloodbaths between the Hindus and Muslims when the British leave. Morrison is blackmailed by Margaret Rose who says that he promised her marriage, {{and would have to}} resign his commission. Khan saves him by planting false <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>she’s</b> been forging ID cards at her home, and the charge against Morrison is dropped. Shortly after that Khan is removed from his command because of his positive attitude to British rule. An emotional farewell dinner for Khan is held at Ley Wong’s.|$|R
5000|$|There is no {{recorded}} {{reference to}} a Tallanus prior to 1452 and certainly no <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> he or <b>she</b> was a saint.|$|R
50|$|A wildwoman named Zana {{is said to}} {{have lived}} in the {{isolated}} mountain village of T'khina fifty miles from Sukhumi in Abkhazia in the Caucasus; some have speculated she may have been an Almas, but the <b>evidence</b> indicates <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was a human.|$|R
25|$|In 1983, an orphaned, thirteen-year-old girl Jehan Mina was {{allegedly}} raped by her uncle and his sons, and became pregnant. She {{was unable to}} provide enough <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was raped. She was charged with adultery and the court considered her pregnancy as the proof of adultery. She was awarded the Tazir punishment of one hundred lashes and three years of rigorous imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, in R v Thornton (No 2) (1996) 2 AER 1023 the {{battered}} wife adduced fresh <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had a personality disorder and the Court of Appeal ordered a retrial considering that, if the evidence had been {{available at the}} original trial, the jury might have reached a different decision. The victim {{does not have to}} be in a position to carry out the threats immediately.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom Chancellor's budget {{statement}} of November 2016, {{it was announced}} that the Trust was to receive a grant of £7.6million for restoration work; the Chancellor noted a claim that the property had been Jane Austen's inspiration for Pemberley in her novel Pride and Prejudice. It was thought that {{there might have been a}} connection to the house because Austen uses the name Fitzwilliam in her novel, but following the Chancellor's Autumn Statement the Jane Austen Society dismissed the likelihood that Austen had had the house in mind, given the absence of any <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had visited the estate.|$|E
50|$|Industry Minister Federica Guidi {{resigned}} in March 2016 when <b>evidence</b> emerged <b>that</b> <b>she</b> sought {{to help her}} boyfriend's business by helping to pass a certain budget amendment. Her boyfriend, Gianluca Gemelli, faced charges of corruption and influence peddling in the so-called Basilicata case.|$|R
6000|$|... "Queen Tera {{was ruled}} in great degree by mysticism, {{and there are}} so many <b>evidences</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> looked for resurrection <b>that</b> {{naturally}} <b>she</b> would choose a period ruled over by a God specialised to such a purpose. Now, the fourth month of the season of Inundation was ruled by Harmachis, this being the name for 'Ra', the Sun-God, at his rising in the morning, and therefore typifying the awakening or arising. This arising is manifestly to physical life, since it is of the mid-world of human daily life. Now as this month begins on our 25th July, the seventh day would be July 31st, for you may be sure that the mystic Queen would not have chosen any day but the seventh or some power of seven.|$|R
50|$|Fitzgerald {{married at}} least twice, {{and there is}} <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> may have married a third time. Her first marriage was in 1941, to Benny Kornegay, a convicted drug dealer and local dockworker. The marriage was annulled in 1942.|$|R
25|$|The sources do not {{record the}} date of Ælfgifu's {{marriage}} to Edmund. The eldest son Eadwig, who had barely reached majority on his accession in 955, may have been born around 940, which gives us only a very rough terminus ante quem for the betrothal. Although {{as the mother of}} two future kings, Ælfgifu proved to be an important royal bed companion, there is no strictly contemporary <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was ever consecrated as queen. In a charter of doubtful authenticity dated 942-946, she attests as the king's concubine (concubina regis). but later in the century Æthelweard the Chronicler styles her queen (regina).|$|E
25|$|One of {{the mysteries}} of Baret's life is how she {{obtained}} at least the rudiments of an education, as her signature on later legal documents provides <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was not illiterate. One of her biographers, Glynis Ridley, suggests that her mother may have been of Huguenot extraction, a group that had a higher tradition of literacy than was otherwise typical of the peasant classes of the time. Another biographer, John Dunmore, suggests {{that she may have}} been taught by the parish priest or taken on as a charity case {{by a member of the}} local gentry.|$|E
25|$|At one point, Iowas Captain Evans {{directed}} Harvard {{to rescue}} prisoners. Some accounts {{suggest that it}} took 12 hours to rescue all the survivors. For a while, several American warships were crowded with prisoners, including Iowa. A pig was rescued from Colon. There were 1,612 Spanish survivors in total who became US prisoners of war until subsequent release during a prisoner exchange. It was a general victory for the US Navy. One unexpected circumstance was that an Austrian battleship (actually an armored cruiser) also named Maria Theresa was in the vicinity wanting to enter Santiago harbor, but upon outbreak of hostilities, waited for orders from the Americans after seeing the conflict; her presence caused mild confusion at some points, {{but there is no}} <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was ever fired on.|$|E
50|$|Ridel married Geva, who {{is often}} stated {{to have been}} an illegitimate {{daughter}} of Hugh, Earl of Chester. However, there is no contemporary <b>evidence</b> stating <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was, and her illegitimacy is inferred from the fact <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not inherit her father's lands. Ridel's lands were centered on Great Weldon in Northamptonshire, which had belonged to Robert de Buci in Domesday Book.|$|R
50|$|Gwen John's last dated work is {{a drawing}} of 20 March 1933, and no <b>evidence</b> {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> drew or painted during the remainder of her life. On 10 September 1939, she wrote her will and then travelled to Dieppe, where she collapsed and was hospitalized. She died there on 18 September 1939 and was buried in Janval Cemetery.|$|R
50|$|On appeal, {{the case}} {{was sent back to}} the same trial judge to allow medical {{evidence}} to be heard. The defence then introduced medical <b>evidence</b> claiming <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had been suffering from a partial complex seizure (an unusual form of epilepsy) {{at the time of the}} killings, while the prosecution's medical <b>evidence</b> maintained <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was only suffering from a mild migraine on that day. The defence's medical evidence was rejected and she was again found guilty and sentenced to death. She received minimal consular support from the Philippine Embassy in Singapore throughout her trial and there was no representative from the Philippine Embassy present in court throughout the duration of the trial. The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Philippine Embassy in Singapore showed an active interest only in the weeks leading up to Contemplacion's execution, when emotions in the Philippines were running high.|$|R
