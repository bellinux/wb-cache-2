25|$|Many cell {{signals are}} carried by {{molecules}} that are released by one cell {{and move to}} make contact with another cell. Endocrine signals are called hormones. Hormones are produced by endocrine cells and they travel through the blood to reach all parts of the body. Specificity of signaling can be controlled if only some cells can respond to a particular hormone. Paracrine signals such as retinoic acid target only cells {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>emitting</b> <b>cell.</b> Neurotransmitters represent another example of a paracrine signal. Some signaling molecules can function as both a hormone and a neurotransmitter. For example, epinephrine and norepinephrine can function as hormones when released from the adrenal gland and are transported to the heart by way of the blood stream. Norepinephrine can also be produced by neurons to function as a neurotransmitter within the brain. Estrogen can be released by the ovary and function as a hormone or act locally via paracrine or autocrine signaling. Active species of oxygen and nitric oxide can also act as cellular messengers. This process is dubbed redox signaling.|$|E

50|$|In Renilla reniformis, RLuc {{is found}} in membrane-bound {{intracellular}} structures within specialized light <b>emitting</b> <b>cells,</b> and is coupled with a closely interacting green fluorescent protein (RrGFP), and a Ca++ activated luciferin binding protein (RrLBP). Although the luciferase catalyzed oxidation of coelenterazine releases a photon of blue light (480 nm), this is not observed in vivo. Instead, the energy released by the reaction involving RLuc is passed via resonance energy transfer to the fluorophore of RrGFP and emitted as a green photon (505 nm), resulting in green bioluminescence observed from the animal. This process relies on a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism, increasing the emitted photon number approximately six-fold.|$|R
40|$|We propose {{extension}} of the numerical method to model effect of Bose-Einstein correlations (BEC) observed in hadronization processes which allows for calculations not only correlation functions $C_ 2 (Q_{inv}) $ (one-dimensional) but also corresponding to them $C_ 2 (Q_{x,y,z}) $ (i. e., three-dimensional). The method {{is based on the}} bunching of identical bosonic particles in elementary <b>emitting</b> <b>cells</b> (EEC) in phase space in manner leading to proper Bose-Einstein form of distribution of energy (this was enough to calculate $C_ 2 (Q_{inv}) $). To obtain also $C_ 2 (Q_{x,y,z}) $ one has to add to it also symmetrization of the multiparticle wave function to properly correlate space-time locations of produced particles with their energy-momentum characteristics.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of exposure to cell phone electromagnetic radiation on the frequency of micronuclei, broken eggs cells, binucleated cells, and karyorrhexis in epithelial cells of the oral mucosa. The sample was composed of 60 cell phone users, who were non-smokers and non-drinkers, and had no clinically visible oral lesions. Cells were obtained from anatomical sites with the highest incidence of oral cancer: lower lip, border of the tongue, and floor of the mouth. The Feulgen reaction was used for quantification of nuclear anomalies in 1, 000 cells/slide. A slightly increase in the number of micronucleated cells in the lower lip and in binucleated cells on the floor of the mouth was observed in individuals who used their phones > 60 minutes/week. The analysis also revealed an increased number of broken eggs in the tongue of individuals owning a cell phone for over eight years. Results suggest that exposure to electromagnetic waves <b>emitted</b> by <b>cell</b> phones can increase nuclear abnormalities in individuals who use a cell phone for more than 60 minutes per week and for over eight years. Based on the present findings, we suggest that exposure to electromagnetic radiation <b>emitted</b> by <b>cell</b> phones may interfere with the development of metanuclear anomalies. Therefore, it is demonstrated that, despite a significant increase in these anomalies, the radiation <b>emitted</b> by <b>cell</b> phones among frequent users is within acceptable physiological limits...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAmong all the {{analytical}} techniques capable of monitoring exocytosis {{in real time}} at the single cell level, electrochemistry (particularly amperometry at a constant potential) using ultramicroelectrodes has been demonstrated {{to be an important}} and convenient tool for more than two decades. Indeed, because the electrochemical sensor is located in the close vicinity of the <b>emitting</b> <b>cell</b> (“artificial synapse” configuration), much data can be gathered from the whole cell activity (secretion frequency) to the individual vesicular release (duration, fluxes or amount of molecules released) with an excellent sensitivity. However, such a single cell analysis and its intrinsic benefits are {{at the expense of the}} spatial resolution and/or the number of experiments. The quite recent development of microdevices/microsystems (and mainly the microelectrode arrays (MEAs)) offers in some way a complementary approach either by combining spectroscopy–microscopy or by implementing a multianalysis. Such developments are described and discussed in the present review over the 2005 – 2014 period...|$|E
40|$|We present DART-Ray, a new {{ray-tracing}} 3 D dust {{radiative transfer}} (RT) code {{designed specifically to}} calculate radiation field energy density (RFED) distributions within dusty galaxy models with arbitrary geometries. In this paper we introduce the basic algorithm implemented in DART-Ray {{which is based on}} a pre-calculation of a lower limit for the RFED distribution. This pre-calculation allows us to estimate the extent of regions around the radiation sources within which these sources contribute significantly to the RFED. In this way, ray-tracing calculations can be restricted to take place only within these regions, thus substantially reducing the computational time compared to a complete ray-tracing RT calculation. Anisotropic scattering is included in the code and handled in a similar fashion. Furthermore, the code utilizes a Cartesian adaptive spatial grid and an iterative method has been implemented to optimize the angular densities of the rays originated from each <b>emitting</b> <b>cell.</b> In order to verify the accuracy of the RT calculations performed by DART-Ray, we present results of comparisons with solutions obtained using the DUSTY 1 D RT code for a dust shell illuminated by a central point source and existing 2 D RT calculations of disc galaxies with diffusely distributed stellar emission and dust opacity. Finally, we show the application of the code on a spiral galaxy model with logarithmic spiral arms in order to measure the effect of the spiral pattern on the attenuation and RFED.

40|$|The {{limitations}} of the recently proposed new method of numerical modelling of Bose-Einstein correlations (BEC) are explicitly demonstrated. It is then argued that BEC should still be considered as emerging from the correlations of fluctuations, however {{they have to be}} modelled first in any Monte Carlo event generator (MCEG) and not added a posteriori to the existing output of some MCEG. Recently we have proposed new method of numerical modelling of BEC which makes use of the fact that BEC can be regarded as correlations of fluctuations 1, 2, 3. Our aim was to provide a fast algorithm, which could be used on the even-by-event basis together with the output of other MCEG’s and which would introduce a characteristic structure of the correlation function C 2 (Q) between them 3. The main idea was 1, 3 to resign from the initial allocation of charges to the particles provided by a given MCEG and to perform then the new allocation in a way which would result in a desired bunching of like particles in the phase space a.
