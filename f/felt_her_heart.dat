60|$|The {{girl did}} not answer, but she <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> shrivel within her.|$|E
60|$|Grace <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> {{beat and}} {{was silent for}} a moment or two.|$|E
60|$|Mabel <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> sink, {{but she had}} {{sufficient}} self-command not to attempt an answer.|$|E
60|$|She {{had been}} allowed to see her father. Lucy and George had gone to the prison, and she {{recalled}} now the details of the brief interview. The whole thing was horrible. She <b>felt</b> that <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> would break.|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} it was ended, the little boy was fast asleep, and the {{faithful}} loyal girl <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> failing <b>heart</b> cheered and strengthened for whatever might be before her, sure that she, her mother, her brother, and her King, were under the shadow of the Almighty wings.|$|R
60|$|Gwendolen <b>felt</b> as if <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> {{were making}} a sudden gambol, and her fingers, which tried to keep a firm hold on her work, got cold.|$|R
60|$|She <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> beating with excitement. The place {{suddenly}} {{seemed to her}} like part of a nightmare.|$|E
60|$|The {{words were}} very commonplace, but oh, the tone! And the smile which {{accompanied}} them! Anne <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> beating strangely.|$|E
60|$|Petite maman <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> beating so vigorously {{that she}} could hardly breathe. She pressed her {{wrinkled}} hands tightly against her bosom.|$|E
60|$|This was {{an order}} to be most joyfully obeyed; this {{was an act of}} {{kindness}} which Fanny <b>felt</b> at <b>her</b> <b>heart.</b> To be spared from her aunt Norris's interminable reproaches! he left her in a glow of gratitude. Anything might be bearable rather than such reproaches. Even to see Mr. Crawford would be less overpowering.|$|R
60|$|But {{the young}} man grew weary. He came more rarely to Locquignol, and very soon he did not come at all. Renelde <b>felt</b> as if <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> would break, but she held firm.|$|R
60|$|In {{the first}} flaming hours of wonder, {{she did not}} know what she felt. She was as if tied to the stake. The flames were licking her and devouring her. But the flames were also good. They seemed to wear her away to rest. What she <b>felt</b> in <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> and <b>her</b> womb {{she did not know}}. It was a kind of swoon.|$|R
6000|$|Nor {{would she}} leave him, she esteem'd him so, [...] Till {{she had seen}} him well with her own eye; [...] So full of pity did her bosom grow, [...] Since first she saw him faint and like to die. [...] Seeing his manners now, and beauty too, [...] She <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> yearn somehow inwardly; [...] She <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> yearn somehow, till at last [...] 'Twas all on fire, and burning warm and fast.|$|E
60|$|They {{exchanged}} rapid glances: A spot of colour {{burned in}} Lady Caroom's cheeks. She <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> quicken, an unspoken prayer upon her lips.|$|E
60|$|Dorothea <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> {{beginning}} to beat faster. Had he that sorrow too? But she feared to say any word, {{and he went}} on immediately.|$|E
60|$|When Mara was {{informed}} by {{a letter from}} Mrs. Pennel, expressed in the few brief words in which that good woman generally embodied her epistolary communications, that Moses had been at home, and gone to Umbagog without seeing <b>her,</b> she <b>felt</b> at <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> only a little closer stricture of cold, quiet pain, which had become a habit of her inner life.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let it go! It's gone I suppose. Well;--I ain't {{going to}} say any more about it. But as for not sorrowing, how is a woman not to sorrow when so much has been lost? It's your poor father I'm {{thinking}} of, Mary." [...] This was {{so much better than}} she had expected that poor Mary almost <b>felt</b> that <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> was lightened.|$|R
50|$|Nataly Andria {{has been}} living in France for many years now but she always <b>felt</b> that <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> was still in her motherland. By the age of 25 years old she became the Goodwill Ambassador of NGO Vakan'ala. She used her fame and raised her voice for {{awareness}} and helped this NGO spreading the message of the necessity of saving and conserving the unique biodiversity heritage of Madagascar.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss de la Molle," [...] he said, and Ida, {{knowing full}} surely what was coming, <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> jump within her bosom and then stand still.|$|E
60|$|Alvina {{seemed to}} keep strangely calm and aloof {{all the days}} after the death. Only when she was alone she {{suffered}} till she <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> really broke.|$|E
6000|$|So sitting, {{served by}} man and maid, [...] She <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> grow prouder: [...] But, ah! {{the more the}} white goose laid [...] It clack'd and cackled louder.|$|E
60|$|She {{struggled}} to escape; {{but it was}} faintly, and only for a moment. Her strength and consciousness were beginning to abandon her. She never attempted to look back; she <b>felt</b> in <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> that Goisvintha was still behind, and dared not to verify the frightful conviction with her eyes. Her lips moved; but they expressed an altered and a vain petition: 'Hermanric! O Hermanric!' was all they murmured now.|$|R
60|$|And at {{last the}} {{handkerchief}} fell. Phyllis <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> own <b>heart</b> almost stop beating, as she gazed down the room. A man of medium height, dark, distinguished, was slowly approaching her, exchanging greetings on every side. His languid eyes fell upon Phyllis. Those who had watched her previously saw then a change. The cold indifference had vanished from her face. She leaned forward as though anxious to attract his attention. She succeeded easily enough.|$|R
60|$|He broke down. Estella flung {{her arms}} around his neck and put her face up to his. She <b>felt</b> as if <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> must break with its great happiness. He {{understood}} her mute pardon. In their kiss the past was put aside. Estella's martyrdom was ended.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I {{always kept}} still when I was told," [...] said Marilla, {{trying to speak}} sternly, albeit she <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> waxing soft within her under Davy's {{impulsive}} caresses.|$|E
60|$|All at once {{he showed}} the ravages of pain and loss that the last year had added to his life of struggle. Lenore embraced him and <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> full.|$|E
60|$|Maggie <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> leap at this subterfuge of Philip's, {{and there}} passed {{over her face}} that almost {{imperceptible}} shock which accompanies any relief. He saw it, and they parted in silence.|$|E
60|$|And Torfrida said yes, and yes, and yes, and <b>felt</b> in <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> {{that she}} knew all that already. Had not she, too, taught, entreated, softened, civilized? Had not she, too, spent her life upon a man, and that man a wolf's-head and a landless outlaw, more utterly than Godiva could ever have spent hers on one who lived lapped in luxury and wealth and power? Torfrida had done her best, and she had failed, or at least fancied in her haste that she had failed.|$|R
60|$|What {{she said}} was {{undoubtedly}} noble and selfless. Lady Blakeney <b>felt</b> in <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> that <b>her</b> keenest sympathy should have gone out to this young woman--pretty, dainty, hardly more than a girl--who seemed to be devoting her young life in a purely philanthropic and unselfish cause. And yet in spite of herself, Marguerite seemed unable to shake off that curious sense of mistrust which had assailed her from the first, nor that feeling of unreality and staginess with which the Frenchwoman's attitude had originally struck her.|$|R
6000|$|She {{buried her}} head still deeper, {{as if to}} hide it. He <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> broken <b>heart</b> beat against his own; he was {{conscious}} of a depth of feeling her rival had never awakened in him. The possibility of Teresa loving him {{had never occurred to}} his simple nature. He bent his head and kissed her. She was frightened, and unloosed her clinging arms; but he retained her hand, and said, [...] "We will leave this accursed place, and you shall go with me as you said you would; nor need you ever leave me, unless you wish it." ...|$|R
60|$|The girl <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> beating unpleasantly fast. It {{would have}} been a relief to assure herself that she was as fond of Gregory as she had been, but she could not do it.|$|E
60|$|Romola had <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> {{chilling}} again. It was a vision, then, this message--one {{of those}} visions {{she had so}} often heard her father allude to with bitterness. Her indignation rushed to her lips.|$|E
60|$|He {{bent his}} head; and Helen <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> leap; {{but it was}} only her fingers upon which his lips burned hot. The next moment he had gone, while leaning breathless against the {{balustrade}} she gazed after him.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Morel <b>felt</b> as if <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> {{would break}} for him. At this rate {{she knew he}} would not live. He had that poignant {{carelessness}} about himself, his own suffering, his own life, which is a form of slow suicide. It almost broke <b>her</b> <b>heart.</b> With all the passion of her strong nature she hated Miriam for having in this subtle way undermined his joy. It did not matter to her that Miriam could not help it. Miriam did it, and she hated her.|$|R
500|$|Tatiana, {{like her}} mother, was deeply {{religious}} and read her Bible frequently. She also studied theology and {{struggled with the}} meaning of [...] "good and evil, sorrow and forgiveness, and man's destiny on earth". She decided that [...] "One has to struggle much because the return for good is evil, and evil reigns." [...] A.A. Mosolov, a court official, felt that Tatiana's reserved nature gave her a [...] "difficult" [...] character, but one with more spiritual depth than her sister Olga. Her English tutor, Sydney Gibbes, who later became a Russian Orthodox priest, disagreed and felt that religion for Tatiana was a duty rather than something she <b>felt</b> in <b>her</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|R
60|$|Two {{wonderful}} things {{had come to}} her. One was the knowledge that she was beautiful, which she came to understand was the burning desire of all women; and again that she was master of things which had scared her. She could wear lovely dresses unconsciously, and sit at table with ease, and walk before her classmates without tremor. She <b>felt</b> power in <b>her</b> <b>heart,</b> {{as well as in}} her fist.|$|R
