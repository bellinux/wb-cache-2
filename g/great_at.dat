Traditionally the Welsh princes had not constructed castles, instead using undefended palaces called , or courts. From the late 11th century onwards, the Normans had advanced into Wales, taking lands in the north and establishing a band of occupied territory in the south called the Welsh Marches. During the 12th century some timber and earthwork castles began to be built, but in small numbers.|$|E
5|$|Honey {{bees are}} not {{native to the}} Americas, {{therefore}} their necessity as pollinators in the U.S. and other regions in the Western Hemisphere is limited to strictly agricultural/ornamental uses, as no native plants require honey bee pollination, except where concentrated in monoculture situations—where the pollination need is so <b>great</b> <b>at</b> bloom time that pollinators must be concentrated beyond the capacity of native bees (with current technology).|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} {{skeletal}} {{benefits associated with}} gymnastics between ulna and radius. Methods: 19 retired artistic gymnasts, aged 18 - 36 years, were compared to 24 sedentary women. Bone mineral content (BMC), total and cortical bone area (ToA, CoA), trabecular and cortical volumetric density (TrD, CoD) and cortical thickness (CoTh) were measured by pQCT at the 4 % and 66 % forearm. Results: At the 4 % site, BMC and ToA were more than twice <b>greater</b> <b>at</b> the radius than ulna whereas at the 66 % site, BMC, ToA, CoA, CoTh and SSIpol were 20 to 51 % <b>greater</b> <b>at</b> the ulna than radius in both groups (p< 0. 0001). At the 4 % site, the skeletal benefits in BMC of the retired gymnasts over the non-gymnasts were 1. 9 times <b>greater</b> <b>at</b> the radius than ulna (p< 0. 001), with enlarged bone size at the distal radius only. In contrast, the skeletal benefits at the 66 % site were twice <b>greater</b> <b>at</b> the ulna than radius for BMC and CoA (p< 0. 01). Conclusion: Whereas the skeletal benefits associated with long-term gymnastics were <b>greater</b> <b>at</b> the radius than ulna in the distal forearm, the reverse {{was found in the}} proximal forearm, suggesting both bones should be analysed when investigating forearm strength. <br /...|$|R
5|$|Robinson's Arch is {{the name}} given to a monumental {{staircase}} carried by an unusually wide stone arch, which once stood at the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount. It was built {{as part of the}} expansion of the Second Temple initiated by Herod the <b>Great</b> <b>at</b> the end of the 1st century BCE. Recent findings suggest that {{it may not have been}} completed until at least 20 years after his death. The massive stone span was constructed along with the retaining walls of the Temple Mount. It carried traffic up from ancient Jerusalem's Lower Market area and over the Tyropoeon street to the Royal Stoa complex on the esplanade of the Mount. The overpass was destroyed during the Great Jewish Revolt, only a few decades after its completion.|$|E
5|$|Whilst wool {{remained}} {{an important part}} of the town's economy into the 19th (and even 20th) centuries, other industries were established in the town. A bell-foundry started in 1684 by William Cockey grew to be a major producer of components for the developing gas industry and employer of 800 people. The J W Singer brass foundry and bronze-casting works, was a major employer and produced bronze statues. John Webb Singer was born in Frome and established his art metal work foundry in 1851. They made brass ornaments for local churches and became known through the Oxford Movement within the Church of England which led to increasing demand for church ornaments. In addition to church ornaments the firm developed the facilities and expertise to create large statues. One of the first statues cast was a copy of General Gordon riding a camel. The firm was also responsible for the bronze statue of Boudica with her daughters in her war chariot (furnished with scythes after the Persian fashion), which was commissioned by Prince Albert and executed by Thomas Thornycroft. It was not cast in bronze until 1902, 17 years after Thornycrofts death, and now stands next to Westminster Bridge and the Houses of Parliament, London. The statue of Lady Justice on the dome above the Old Bailey was executed by the British sculptor, F. W. Pomeroy and cast by Singers. She holds a sword in her right hand and a pair of weighing scales in her left. The statue is popularly supposed to show blind Justice; however, the figure is not blindfolded. The statue of Alfred the <b>Great</b> <b>at</b> Winchester was a further commission. The statues from Singers have also been exported around the world. Printing was another major industry, with the Butler and Tanner printworks being set up in the middle of the century. Brewing was also a source of employment.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{hormonal}} response to acute ethanol ingestion following a bout of heavy resistance exercise in women. Eight resistance trained women completed two identical acute heavy resistance exercise tasks (AHRET). From 10 - 20 minutes post-AHRET, participants consumed either a grain ethanol or a placebo beverage. Blood was collected before (PRE) and immediately after the AHRET (IP) and then every 20 minutes for five hours. Blood collected after beverage ingestion was pooled into 3 batches (phases: 20 - 40 minutes, 60 - 120 minutes, and 140 - 300 minutes post-exercise) and analyzed for serum total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), human growth hormone (GH), cortisol (COR), and estradiol (E 2) concentrations. Circulating concentrations of TT were significantly <b>greater</b> <b>at</b> P 20 - 40 than at PRE, P 60 - 120, and P 140 - 300. Circulating concentrations of FT were significantly <b>greater</b> <b>at</b> P 20 - 40 than at all other times. Circulating concentrations of GH were significantly <b>greater</b> <b>at</b> IP than at PRE, P 60 - 120, and P 140 - 300. Circulating concentrations of COR were significantly <b>greater</b> <b>at</b> P 20 - 40 than at all other times. Additionally, COR concentrations at P 140 - 300 were significantly lower than at all other times. Circulating concentrations of IGF- 1 were significantly <b>greater</b> <b>at</b> P 20 - 40 than at P 60 - 120 and P 140 - 300. Circulating concentrations of E 2 were significantly <b>greater</b> <b>at</b> P 20 - 40 than at all other times. In summary, the present study demonstrated an acute modulation of the neuroendocrine milieu following a heavy resistance exercise bout in women. Ethanol ingestion appeared to have no significant effect on the characteristics of acute hormonal augmentation in TT, FT, GH, COR, IGF- 1, or E 2...|$|R

25|$|St. Petersburg {{was built}} by Peter the <b>Great</b> <b>at</b> the {{beginning}} of the eighteenth century, on the swampy shores and islands of the Neva. The difficulties of construction were numerous, but Peter was unperturbed by the expenditure of human life required to fulfill his vision of a city on the coast. Of the artisans whom he compelled to come north to lay the foundations of the city, thousands died of hardship and disease; and the city, in its unnatural location, was at the mercy of terrible floods caused by the breaking-up of the ice of the Lake Ladoga just east of it or- as on the occasion described in the poem- by the west wind blowing back the Neva. There had been one such devastating flood in 1777 and again in 1824, during Pushkin’s time and the flood modeled in the poem, and they continue to this day.|$|E

The Hungarian population was so <b>great</b> <b>at</b> one time that Cleveland boasted of having the highest concentration of Hungarians outside of Budapest. Cleveland-Akron area is home to a large Slavic population (17.2% far higher than the nation's rate of 6%). The Greater Cleveland area is home to roughly 171,000 Polish, 38,000 Slovaks, 66,000 Slovenes 38,000 Czechs, 31,000 Russians, and 23,000 Ukrainians. Slavic Village and Shaker Square once had some of the larger concentration in the city of Cleveland. Today, Slavic Village still continues to be home to many Slavic Ohioans. The Greater Cleveland area is home to the largest Slovak, Slovene, and Hungarian community in the world, outside of Slovakia, Slovenia, and Hungary. In addition Slovenia maintains a Consulate-General in Downtown Cleveland. The city of Cleveland has also received visits from the Presidents of Hungary and Poland.|$|E

In spite of his respect for the Prussian king, Napoleon stole Frederick's sword and other trophies. The French right wing {{consisted}} of Davout's corps, Lannes' corps, Marshal Pierre Augereau's VII Corps, and Murat's 1st Cuirassier Division under General of Division Etienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty, 2nd Cuirassier Division led by General of Division Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul, and 3rd Dragoon Division under General of Division Marc Antoine de Beaumont.

25|$|The {{operations}} of the Pharaoh Thutmose III gives evidence of Egyptian sophistication. At the Battle of Megiddo, in present-day Jordan, Syrian troops deployed {{in front of the}} city. Thutmose first sent the left wing of his force northwest of Megiddo, to cut off the Syrian line of retreat. He redeployed his right wing south of the city, and concentrated his powerful strike force of chariots, over 1,000 of them in the center. The chariots smashed the right flank of the Syrian formation and the Egyptian infantry, coming up fast, waded into the fray with javelin, sword and battle-axe. The Syrians army crumbled. Such successes were to continue as the improved Egyptian forces grew in power and influence throughout the region. The rise of Persia saw the conquest of the Egyptian state and the end of its independent military activity, however Egyptian forces, including the Nubian bowmen, still continued to make their mark as part of the Persian army, and even saw action against Alexander the <b>Great</b> <b>at</b> Issus, circa 333BC.|$|E
25|$|The region enters {{history at}} the end of the 3rd {{millennium}} BCE, when Arbil is mentioned as Urbilum by king Shulgi of the Ur III dynasty. From that time onward, the Little Zab basin became increasingly entangled in the affairs of the successive Mesopotamian empires that sought control over the Zagros Mountains. In the early second millennium BCE, king Shamshi-Adad of Upper Mesopotamia waged war to the land of Qabra, which was probably located along the lower course of the Little Zab, and installed garrisons in the conquered towns. The archive of clay tablets found at Tell Shemshara (ancient Shusharra) shows that the local governor switched allegiance and became a vassal of Shamshi-Adad. During the 14th century BCE, the region was part of the Mitannian kingdom, with sites like Nuzi and Tell al-Fakhar, south of the Little Zab, yielding clay tablet archives for this period. During the late second–early first millennia BCE, the lower Little Zab basin belonged to the heartland of the Middle Assyrian and Neo-Assyrian empires. After the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, control of the Zagros shifted first to the Medes and in 550 BCE to the Achaemenid Empire. The last Achaemenid ruler Darius III was defeated by Alexander the <b>Great</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of Gaugamela in northern Iraq and after Alexander’s death in 323, the area fell to his Seleucid successors.|$|E
