25|$|The heavy, {{close-grained}} yellow-orange wood is very {{dense and}} is prized for tool handles, treenails, fence posts, and other applications requiring a strong dimensionally stable wood that withstands rot. Although its wood is commonly knotty and twisted, straight-grained Osage orange timber makes very good bows. In Arkansas, {{in the early}} 19th century, a good Osage bow was worth a horse and a blanket.

500|$|Yellow dyes are [...] "about as {{numerous}} as red ones", {{and can be}} extracted from saffron, pomegranate rind, turmeric, safflower, onionskins, {{and a number of}} weedy flowering plants. [...] Limited evidence suggests the use of weld (Reseda luteola), also called mignonette or dyer's rocket before the Iron Age, but it was an important dye of the ancient Mediterranean and Europe and is indigenous to England. Two brilliant yellow dyes of commercial importance in Europe from the 18th century are derived from trees of the Americas: quercitron from the inner bark of Eastern Black Oak (Quercus velutina), native to eastern North America and <b>fustic</b> from the dyer's mulberry tree (Maclura tinctoria) of the West Indies and Mexico.|$|E
500|$|If {{plants that}} yield yellow dyes are common, plants that yield green dyes are rare. [...] Both woad and indigo {{have been used}} since ancient times in {{combination}} with yellow dyes to produce shades of green. [...] Medieval and Early Modern England was especially known for its green dyes. [...] The dyers of Lincoln, a great cloth town in the high Middle Ages, produced the Lincoln green cloth associated with Robin Hood by dyeing wool with woad and then overdyeing it yellow with weld or dyer's greenweed (Genista tinctoria), also known as dyer's broom. [...] Woolen cloth mordanted with alum and dyed yellow with dyer's greenweed was overdyed with woad and, later, indigo, to produce the once-famous Kendal green. This in turn fell out of fashion in the 18th century {{in favor of the}} brighter Saxon green, dyed with indigo and <b>fustic.</b>|$|E
60|$|Well, after a great {{search for}} what was best and most convenient, Friday, at last, whose {{judgment}} in such affairs was much superior to mine, pitches upon a kind of wood the most fitting for it. To this day I cannot tell {{the name of the}} tree, nor describe it any other way, than only by saying, that it is like what we call <b>fustic,</b> or between that and the Niacaragua wood, being much of the same colour and smell. But though my man exceeded me in the knowledge of the most proper tree, yet I shewed him a much better and clearer way to make a canoe than ever he knew before; for he was for burning the hollow or cavity of the tree, in order to make this boat; but I then told him how he might do it with tools, learning him at the same time how to use them, which indeed he did very dexterously; so that in a month's time we finished it, making it very handsome, by cutting the outside in the true shape of a boat. After this it took us a full fortnight before we could get her into the water, which we did as it were inch by inch, upon great rollers; but when she was in, she would have carried twenty men, with all the ease imaginable.|$|E
60|$|That is why I {{have thought}} that a {{treatise}} De Banana might not, perhaps, be wholly without its usefulness to the modern English reading world. After all, a food-stuff which supports hundreds of millions among our beloved tropical fellow-creatures ought to be very dear {{to the heart of}} a nation which governs (and annually kills) more black people, taken in the mass, than all the other European powers put together. We have introduced the blessings of British rule--the good and well-paid missionary, the Remington rifle, the red-cotton pocket-handkerchief, and the use of 'the liquor called rum'--into so many remote corners of the tropical world that it is high time we should begin in return to learn somewhat about fetiches and <b>fustic,</b> Jamaica and jaggery, bananas and Buddhism. We know too little still about our colonies and dependencies. 'Cape Breton an island!' cried King George's Minister, the Duke of Newcastle, in the well-known story, 'Cape Breton an island! Why, so it is! God bless my soul! I must go and tell the King that Cape Breton's an island.' That was a hundred years ago; but only the other day the Board of Trade placarded all our towns and villages with a flaming notice to the effect that the Colorado beetle had made its appearance at 'a town in Canada called Ontario,' and might soon be expected to arrive at Liverpool by Cunard steamer. The right honourables and other high mightinesses who put forth the notice in question were evidently unaware that Ontario is a province as big as England, including in its borders Toronto, Ottawa, Kingston, London, Hamilton, and other large and flourishing towns. Apparently, in spite of competitive examinations, the schoolmaster is still abroad in the Government offices.|$|E
60|$|For example, can you {{honestly}} pretend {{that you really}} understand the use and importance of that valuable object of everyday demand, <b>fustic?</b> I remember an ill-used telegraph clerk in a tropical colony once complaining to me that English cable operators were so disgracefully ignorant about this important staple as invariably to substitute for its name the word 'justice' in all telegrams which originally referred to it. Have you any clear and definite notions as to the prime origin and final destination of a thing called jute, in whose sole manufacture the whole great and flourishing town of Dundee lives and moves and has its being? What is turmeric? Whence do we obtain vanilla? How many commercial products are yielded by the orchids? How many totally distinct plants in different countries afford the totally distinct starches lumped together in grocers' lists under the absurd name of arrowroot? When you ask for sago do you really see that you get it? and how many entirely different objects described as sago are known to commerce? Define the uses of partridge canes and cohune oil. What objects are generally manufactured from tucum? Would it surprise you to learn that English door-handles are commonly made out of coquilla nuts? that your wife's buttons are turned from the indurated fruit of the Tagua palm? and that the knobs of umbrellas grew originally in the remote depths of Guatemalan forests? Are you aware that a plant called manioc supplies the starchy food of about one-half the population of tropical America? These are the sort of inquiries with which a new edition of 'Mangnall's Questions' {{would have to be}} filled; and as to answering them--why, even the pupil-teachers in a London Board School (who represent, I suppose, the highest attainable level of human knowledge) would often find themselves completely nonplussed. The fact is, tropical trade has opened out so rapidly and so wonderfully that nobody knows much about the chief articles of tropical growth; we go on using them in an uninquiring spirit of childlike faith, much as the Jamaica negroes go on using articles of European manufacture about whose origin they are so ridiculously ignorant that one young woman once asked me whether it was really true that cotton handkerchiefs were dug up out of the ground over in England. Some dim confusion between coal or iron and Manchester piece-goods seemed to have taken firm possession of her infantile imagination.|$|E
60|$|Upon the whole, as I {{found by}} all his {{discourse}} a settled affection to me, and {{that nothing could}} part him from me, so I found all the foundation of his desire {{to go to his}} own country was laid in his ardent affection to the people, and his hopes of my doing them good; a thing which, as I had no notion of myself, so I had not the least thought or intention, or desire of undertaking it. But still I found a strong inclination to attempting my escape, founded on the supposition gathered from the discourse, that there were seventeen bearded men there; and therefore, without any more delay, I went to work with Friday to find out a great tree proper to fell, and make a large periagua, or canoe, to undertake the voyage. There were trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet, not of periaguas or canoes, but even of good, large vessels; but the main thing I looked at was, to get one so near the water that we might launch it when it was made, to avoid the mistake I committed at first. At last Friday pitched upon a tree; for I found he knew much better than I what kind of wood was fittest for it; nor can I tell to this day what wood to call the tree we cut down, except that it was very like the tree we call <b>fustic,</b> or between that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour and smell. Friday wished to burn the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to make it for a boat, but I showed him how to cut it with tools; which, after I had showed him how to use, he did very handily; and in about a month’s hard labour we finished it and made it very handsome; especially when, with our axes, which I showed him how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat. After this, however, it cost us near a fortnight’s time to get her along, as it were inch by inch, upon great rollers into the water; but when she was in, she would have carried twenty men with great ease.|$|E

It was his use of the materials and traditions of island architecture that was truly innovative.Wealthy friends clamoured for Messel to design houses for them, both on Barbados and Mustique, and thus began what architect Barbara Hill described as “his work … of converting quite ordinary houses into wonderlands.” As well as his own home, Maddox, he re-designed and supervised the renovations of Leamington House and Pavilion (for the Heinz family), Crystal Springs, Cockade House, Alan Bay and <b>Fustic</b> House.

50|$|Moist {{forests are}} {{classified}} as being either lowland mesic, montane mesic, lowland wet, or montane wet. Characteristic lowland species are Haitian catalpa (Catalpa longissima), particularly in well-drained soils, and West Indian mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni). Puerto Rican royal palm (Roystonea borinquena) is common where soil is calcareous. Paradise tree (Simarouba glauca), anón de majagua (Lonchocarpus heptaphyllus), jagua (Genipa americana), black olive (Bucida buceras), West Indian lancewood (Oxandra lanceolata) and amacey (Tetragastris balsamifera) are found in small secondary stands. Isolated trees are home to <b>fustic</b> (Maclura tinctoria), logwood (Haematoxylum campechianum), iris (Hippeastrum puniceum), caracolí (Abarema glauca), córbano (Albizia berteriana), West Indian elm (Guazuma ulmifolia), palo de leche (Rauvolfia nitida), and spiny fiddlewood (Citharexylum spinosum). Areas where soils are superficial or savannas have formed from degraded forest are indicated by trees such as the sandpaper tree (Curatella americana), grandleaf seagrape (Coccoloba pubescens), Jamaican nettletree (Trema micrantha) and Tabebuia species. Cashews (Anacardium occidentale) are present in zones that have marginal earth and precipitation closer {{to that of the}} dry forests. Yellow olivier (Buchenavia capitata), sablito (Schefflera morototoni), maricao (Byrsonima spicata) aguacatillo (Alchornea latifolia), West Indian cherry (Prunus myrtifolia), árbol de Santa Maria (Calophyllum brasiliense), cocuyo (Hirtella triandra), American muskwood (Guarea guidonia), palo de yagua (Casearia arborea), locust (Hymenaea courbaril), balatá (Manilkara domingensis) and sierra palm (Prestoea montana) grow in mesic forests. Hispaniolan pine (Pinus occidentalis) is common on lateritic soils. Wet forests consist of trees covered by parasitic plants and epiphytes. The principal indicator species include tree ferns (Cyathea spp.) and Chionanthus species. At higher elevations, characteristic species are the trembling schefflera (Schefflera tremula), black sapote (Diospyros digyna), almendrón (Prunus occidentalis), Fadyen's silktassel (Garrya fadyenii), Weinmannia pinnata, Oreopanax capitatus, Brunellia comocladifolia, Hispaniolan pines, and Cyathea species.|$|E
30|$|The {{presence}} of copper {{in relation to}} green textiles where morin was identified matches historical information that points {{to the use of}} copper mordants with old <b>fustic</b> to create olive tones [64]. Morin was identified on samples from patterns 367, 368, 370 and 377, which indeed points to the use of old <b>fustic,</b> a ‘New World’ dyestuff. Besides morin, we also identified quercetin in pattern 377, which strongly suggests a compound recipe.|$|E
30|$|In {{contrast}} {{to most of}} the yellow-coloured samples, the one from pattern 447 showed morin, suggesting the use of old <b>fustic</b> (Maclura tinctoria), a strong yellow dye originally found in Central and South America and the Caribbean [32]. We were able to do SEM–EDX on this sample by carbon-coating the textile fibre. False colour maps (Fig.  3) show the presence of aluminium, calcium and potassium, strongly suggesting old <b>fustic</b> mordanted wool using calcium tartar possibly mixed with alum. Ponting notes yellows could be obtained using old <b>fustic,</b> aluminium and tin, although the resulting colours were not light fast [39]. Given the light sensitivity of flavonols such as morin, the vibrancy of the yellow hues in the pattern book examined gives additional weight to the view that the textile swatches have been rarely exposed to ultraviolet radiation [23, 29].|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an analytical procedure based on GC-MS to identify in textiles {{the most common}} flavonoid yellow dyes used in Europe since ancient times, extracted from weld, young <b>fustic,</b> dyer's broom, sawwort and the berries of some species of Rhamnus.

30|$|Only one sample—from pattern 7 —contained weld. The {{presence}} of sulfuretin and fisetin strongly suggested {{the use of}} young <b>fustic,</b> which with the weld yields a rich orange hue. Young <b>fustic</b> (Cotinus coggygria), a shrub found in Southern and Central Europe provided a golden yellow colour, but it was often mixed with other dyestuffs to modify colours and/or hues.

40|$|Young <b>fustic</b> (Cotinus coggygria Scop.; Anacardiaceae) {{has been}} used as a {{dyestuff}} since antiquity.

The isolated compounds were used as reference materials for the development of a high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector-MS method, which was then applied to analyse (1) fresh silk samples dyed with young <b>fustic,</b> (2) dyed silk subjected to artificially accelerated light ageing and (3) historical silk micro-samples, extracted from ecclesiastical post-Byzantine garments (fifteenth to eighteenth century), which belong to monasteries of Mount Athos. Sulfuretin and fisetin, which are usually used as markers for the identification of the yellow dye and, for the first time, some of the aforementioned flavonoid components of young <b>fustic</b> were identified in the historical extracts. Furthermore, preliminary experiments suggested that although the amounts of the dye components decrease with light ageing, the relative ratio of fisetin and sulfuretin, after a first step of ageing, seems to be almost unaffected by such degradation processes raised by light.
