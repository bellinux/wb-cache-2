The BCI {{is due to}} the interaction of the slow cyclotron wave of the electron beam with the fast betatron wave of the ion beam. The electron-ion system consists of a high current relativistic electron beam propagating co-axially with a nonrelativistic ion beam in a drift tube. The BCI occurs when the ion beam radius is no less than the <b>electron</b> beam <b>radius</b> in the case of parameters acceptable for the ion beam undulator. Unlike [1], the external <b>radii</b> of the <b>electron</b> and ion beams are considered to be strongly different.
