40|$|This manual {{contains}} {{useful information}} in writing programs using the GNAT compiler. It includes information on implementation dependent characteristics of GNAT, {{including all the}} information required by Annex M of the Ada language standard. GNAT implements Ada 95 and Ada 2005, and {{it may also be}} invoked in Ada 83 compat-ibility mode. By default, GNAT assumes Ada 2005, but you can override with a compiler switch to explicitly specify the language version. (Please refer to Section “Compiling Dif-ferent Versions of Ada ” in GNAT User’s <b>Guide,</b> <b>for</b> <b>details</b> on these switches.) Throughout this manual, references to “Ada ” without a year suffix apply to both the Ada 95 and Ada 2005 versions of the language. Ada is designed to be highly portable. In general, a program will have the same effect even when compiled by different compilers on different platforms. However, since Ada is designed to be used {{in a wide variety of}} applications, it also contains a number of system dependent features to be used in interfacing to the external world. Note: Any program that makes use of implementation-dependent features may be non-portable. You should follow good programming practice and isolate and clearly document any sections of your program that make use of these features in a non-portable manner. What This Reference Manual Contains This reference manual contains the following chapters: • Chapter 1 [Implementation Defined Pragmas], page 5, lists GNAT implementation-dependent pragmas, which can be used to extend and enhance the functionality of the compiler. • Chapter 2 [Implementation Defined Attributes], page 67, lists GNAT implementation-dependent attributes, which can be used to extend and enhance the functionality of the compiler...|$|E

The Youth Cohort Study (YCS) is a major programme of longitudinal research designed to monitor the behaviour and decisions of representative samples of young people aged sixteen upwards as they {{make the transition from}} compulsory education to further or higher education, or to the labour market. It tries to identify and explain the factors which influence post- 16 transitions, for example, educational attainment, training opportunities, experiences at school. To date the YCS covers thirteen cohorts and over forty surveys. The first cohort was first surveyed in 1985 and the thirteenth in 2007. The questionnaires have been designed, over the years, to be broadly comparable, but external changes and shifts in policy interest have brought about changes - some minor, some fundamental. Cohorts One to Twelve cover England and Wales but a change to the methodology means that from Cohort Thirteen, data cover England only. For further details of the methodology and coverage, see the documentation. The UK Data Archive currently holds data for the cohorts listed below: Cohort One (SN 3093) surveyed those eligible to leave school in 1983 - 84 Cohort Two (SN 3094) surveyed those eligible to leave school in 1984 - 85 *Cohort Three (SN 3012) surveyed those eligible to leave school in 1985 - 86 Cohort Four (SN 3107) surveyed those eligible to leave school in 1987 - 88 Cohort Five (SN 3531) surveyed those eligible to leave school in 1989 - 90 Cohort Six (SN 3532) surveyed those eligible to leave school in 1990 - 91 Cohort Seven (SN 3533) surveyed those eligible to leave school in 1992 - 93 Cohort Eight (SN 3805) surveyed those eligible to leave school in 1995 - 96 Cohort Nine (SN 4009) surveyed those eligible to leave school in 1996 - 97 Cohort Ten (SN 4571) surveyed those eligible to leave school in 1998 - 99 Cohort Eleven (SN 5452) surveyed those eligible to leave school in 2000 - 01 Cohort Twelve (SN 5830) surveyed those eligible to leave school in 2002 - 03 Cohort Thirteen (SN 6024) surveyed those eligible to leave school in 2005 - 06 *Some teaching materials using the data from Cohort Three have been developed. Details are available from the Teaching Resources and Materials for Social Scientists (TRAMSS) website. Cohort Thirteen: The methodology of the YCS changed at Cohort Thirteen, to allow linkage with the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE) (held at the UK Data Archive under SN 5545). Samples for Cohort Thirteen and LSYPE were taken from the same academic cohort and their questionnaires and methodology were harmonised to facilitate analysis of the merged datasets. Also, from Cohort Thirteen onwards, the YCS is only conducted in England and no longer runs in Wales. The larger sample from the combined YCS and LSYPE surveys enables analysis at a greater level of detail, for example to show gender differences within a breakdown by ethnic origin. The data collection method for Cohort Thirteen was different to previous YCS surveys. Sweep One used a face-to-face methodology in order to address falling response rates on recent YCS cohorts. Sweeps Two, Three and Four were conducted using a mixed-mode methodology (online, telephone and face-to-face interviewing). In particular, there had been concern over differential response rates between high attainers and low attainers, and it was considered that the use of a face-to-face method at Sweep One mixed-mode at Sweeps Two to Four, would boost response rates amongst low attainers. Users who require more detailed data than those available in the standard access files should consult the User <b>Guide</b> <b>for</b> <b>details.</b> The confidentiality form to be used for such applications is available in Word format in the documentation table below. For the second edition (February 2011), data and documentation from Sweeps Two and Three were added to the study. For the third edition (February 2012), data and documentation from Sweep Four were added. Main Topics : Sweep One mainly concentrated on identifying respondents' experiences of year 11 including careers advice; economic activity, their activity history; qualifications sought, information on Higher Education, a self completion section (covering risky behaviours) as well as some background information about their families and attitudes. Sweep Two focused on current activities; jobs and training; qualifications being studied for at time of interview; higher education; young people Not in Employment, Education or Training (NEET); Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA); community cohesion; own children and caring responsibilities. An activity history was also provided. Sweep Three focused on current activities,; jobs and training; qualifications being studied for at time of interview; higher education students; potential higher education students; sources of information, advice and guidance; relationships; own children; and caring responsibilities.

We have defined six RFLPs for OAT, to explore its possible role in gyrate atrophy (GA) of the choroid and retina, an autosomal recessive genetic disorder associated with a deficiency of OAT activity. The RFLPs, which are detected by noncoding single-copy probes from the OAT gene and by subclones of the HOAT 1 cDNA, all map on human chromosome 10, producing an overall level of heterozygosity for the OAT locus of 83 %. Using the RFLPs, we have determined that the OAT locus segregates concordantly with GA in one available pedigree. Furthermore, the RFLPs display significant disequilibrium with GA, providing genetic evidence implicating a defect in the OAT structural gene {{as the cause of}} this disorder. The RFLPs for OAT are potentially applicable to prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection in families with a previous history of GA.

40|$|The {{airspace}} operations demonstration (AOD) {{is intended}} {{to show that the}} Access 5 Step 1 functional requirements can be met. The demonstration will occur in two phases. The initial on-range phase will be carried out in restricted airspace to demonstrate the cooperative collision avoidance (CCA) functional requirements and to provide risk-reduction for the AOD by allowing the test team to rehearse some elements of the demonstration mission. The CCA system to be used in these flights is based on Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) which is a commercially-available system by which airplanes constantly broadcast their current position and altitude to other aircraft and ground resources over a dedicated radio datalink. The final phase will occur in the national airspace (NAS) and will be the formal demonstration of the remainder of the proposed functional requirements. The general objectives of the AOD are as follows: (1) Demonstrate that the UAS can aviate in the NAS (2) Demonstrate that the UAS can navigate in the NAS (3) Demonstrate that the UAS can communicate with the NAS (4) Demonstrate that the UAS can perform selected collision avoidance functions in the NAS (5) Demonstrate that the UAS can evaluate and avoid weather conflicts in the NAS (6) Demonstrate that the UAS can provide adequate command and control in the NAS In addition to the stated objectives, {{there are a number of}} goals for the flight demonstration. The demo can be accomplished successfully without achieving these goals, but these goals are to be used as a guideline for preparing for the mission.

40|$|The {{objective}} of {{the research and development}} work reported in this document was to develop a Virtual Intelligence Technique for optimization of the Preferred Upstream Management Practices (PUMP) for the upstream oil industry. The work included the development of a software tool for identification and optimization of the most influential parameters in upstream common practices as well as geological, geophysical and reservoir engineering studies. The work was performed in cooperation with three independent producing companies [...] Newfield Exploration, Chesapeake Energy, and Triad Energy [...] operating in the Golden Trend, Oklahoma. In order to protect data confidentiality, these companies are referred to as Company One, Two, Three in a randomly selected order. These producing companies provided geological, completion, and production data on 320 wells and participated in frequent technical discussions throughout the project. Research and development work was performed by Gas Technology Institute (GTI), West Virginia University (WVU), and Intelligent Solutions Inc. (ISI). Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association (OIPA) participated in technology transfer and data acquisition efforts. Deliverables from the project are the present final report and a user-friendly software package (Appendix D) with two distinct functions: a characterization tool that identifies the most influential parameters in the upstream operations, and an optimization tool that seeks optimization by varying a number of influential parameters and investigating the coupled effects of these variations. The electronic version of this report is also included in Appendix D. The Golden Trend data were used for the first cut optimization of completion procedures. In the subsequent step, results from soft computing runs were used as the <b>guide</b> <b>for</b> <b>detailed</b> geophysical and reservoir engineering studies that characterize the cause-and-effect relationships between various parameters. The general workflow and the main performing units were as follows: (1) Data acquisition. (GTI, OIPA, Participating producers.) (2) Development of the virtual intelligence software. (WVU, ISI); (3) Application of the software on the acquired data. (GTI, ISI); (4) Detailed production analysis using conventional engineering techniques and the DECICE neural network software. (GTI) and (5) Detailed seismic analysis using Inspect spectral decomposition package and Hapmson-Russell's EMERGE inversion package. (GTI) Technology transfer took place through several workshops held at offices of the participating companies, at OIPA offices, and presentations at the SPE panel on soft computing applications and at the 2003 annual meeting of Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO). In addition, results were exhibited at the SPE annual meeting, published in GasTips, and placed on the GTI web page. Results from the research and development work were presented to the producing companies as a list of recommended recompletion wells and the corresponding optimized operations parameters. By the end of the project, 16 of the recommendations have been implemented the majority of which resulted in increased production rates to several folds. This constituted a comprehensive field demonstration with positive results...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the removal efficiency of microbial contaminants from two hospitals on-site Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) in Saudi Arabia. Hospital wastewaters often go untreated in Saudi Arabia as in many devolving countries, where no specific regulations are imposed regarding hospital wastewater treatment. The current guidelines are placed to ensure a safe treated wastewater quality, however, they do not regulate for pathogenic bacteria and emerging contaminants. Results from this study have detected pathogenic bacterial genera and antibiotic resistant bacteria in the sampled hospitals wastewater. And although the treatment process {{of one of the}} hospitals was able to meet current quality guidelines, the other hospital treatment process failed to meet these guidelines and disgorge of its wastewater might be cause for concern. In order to estimate the risk to the public health and the impact of discharging the treated effluent to the public sewage, a comprehensive investigation is needed that will facilitate and <b>guide</b> suggestions <b>for</b> more <b>detailed</b> guidelines and monitoring...|$|R
