The display consists of the shark hunching its back, lowering its pectoral fins, <b>gaping</b> its jaws, and swimming with an exaggerated side-to-side motion. Known parasites of this species include the copepods Nesippus orientalis, Perissopus dentatus, Pandarus sinuatus, Kroyeria sphyrnae, Nemesis atlantica, and Eudactylina spinifera, as well as tapeworms in the genera Paraorygmatobothrium and Platybothrium.|$|E

40|$|Nestling birds solicit {{food from}} their parents by {{displaying}} their open brightly coloured <b>gapes.</b> Carotenoids affect <b>gape</b> colour, but also {{play a central role}} in immunostimulation. Therefore, we hypothesize that, by differentially allocating resources to nestlings with more brightly coloured <b>gapes,</b> parents favour healthy offspring which are able to allocate carotenoids to <b>gape</b> coloration without compromising their immune defence. We demonstrated that, in the barn swallow Hirundo rustica, (i) parents differentially allocate food to nestlings with an experimentally brighter red <b>gape,</b> (ii) nestlings challenged with a novel antigen (sheep red blood cells, SRBCs) have less bright <b>gape</b> colour than their control siblings, (iii) nestlings challenged with SRBCs but also provided with the principal circulating carotenoid (lutein) have more brightly coloured red <b>gapes</b> than their challenged but unsupplemented siblings and (iv) the <b>gape</b> colour of nestlings challenged with SRBCs and provisioned with lutein exceeds that of siblings that were unchallenged. This suggests that parents may favour nestlings with superior health by preferentially feeding offspring with the brightest <b>gapes...</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Gapes</b> of {{juvenile}} altricial birds are often brightly coloured, sometimes with contrasting spots or other patterns, {{and these are}} believed to be an indication of their health, fitness and competitive ability. Based on this, the parents decide how to distribute food among the chicks in the nest. Some species, especially in the families Viduidae and Estrildidae, have bright spots on the <b>gape</b> known as <b>gape</b> tubercles or <b>gape</b> papillae. These nodular spots are conspicuous even in low light. A study examining the nestling <b>gapes</b> of eight passerine species found that the <b>gapes</b> were conspicuous in the ultraviolet spectrum (visible to birds but not to humans). Parents may, however, not rely solely on the <b>gape</b> coloration, and other factors influencing their decision remain unknown.|$|R

5|$|Meat ants {{engage in}} ritualised fights to {{maintain}} and resolve boundary disputes with neighbouring colonies. When individuals from separate colonies meet, they will engage each other until appeasement occurs. A meat ant detects a foreign worker by intense antennation and <b>gaping</b> of the mandibles, and will also stretch themselves upward to appear taller and larger, suggesting that meat ants {{do this in a}} display of size matching. Once the ants have finished fighting, they will groom themselves and search for another ant. Such disputes between colonies may continue for months or even years in the same area, and escalated fights that result in serious injury or death are rare.|$|E
2500|$|Red <b>gape</b> color {{has been}} shown in several {{experiments}} to induce feeding. An experiment in manipulating brood size and immune system with barn swallow nestlings showed the vividness of the <b>gape</b> was positively correlated with T-cell–mediated immunocompetence, and that larger brood size and injection with an antigen led to a less vivid <b>gape.</b> Conversely, the red <b>gape</b> of the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) did not induce extra feeding in host parents. Some brood parasites, such as the Hodgson's hawk-cuckoo [...] (C. fugax), have colored patches on the wing that mimic the <b>gape</b> color of the parasitized species.|$|R
25|$|When born, the chick's <b>gape</b> flanges are fleshy.

25|$|In bird anatomy, the <b>gape</b> is the {{interior}} of the open mouth of a bird, and the <b>gape</b> flange is the region where the two mandibles join together {{at the base of the}} beak. The width of the <b>gape</b> can be a factor in the choice of food.|$|R
5|$|Premastication and mouth-to-mouth feeding {{in humans}} is {{postulated}} to have {{evolved from the}} regurgitation of food from parent to offspring or male to female (courtship feeding) and has been observed in numerous mammals and animals of other species. For instance, food begging behaviour observed in young wolves, wild dogs and certain gulls species, which involves the young approaching the beak or mouth of the adult with their own whereupon <b>gaping</b> their mouths or nuzzling, the adult would regurgitate portions of food to feed the young. However, in the aforementioned animals, this nuzzling behaviour {{and other types of}} mouth-to-mouth contact are also used for bonding, socialization, and courtship.|$|E
5|$|The Antonine Wall and its {{associated}} forts left a direct sculptural legacy in Scotland. There are 19 distance slabs along the wall that depict graphically the victories and marches of the legions involved in its construction. There are also surviving sculptures, including an altar to Diana and Apollo. There is a fountainhead from a bath-house {{in the shape of}} a man's head with a <b>gaping</b> mouth, and the head from a bust or statue, perhaps the goddess Fortuna, both found at Bearsden Roman Fort, East Dunbartonshire, both showing a local Celtic influence in their style.|$|E

Nora Pearce appears and asks what happened to Curtis Delario. Soon afterwards, Scully finds Delario’s body left in a garbage can nearby; his face has <b>gaping</b> holes in it. Autopsying the remains, Scully concludes that the five holes in the man’s face were made by human fingers, as someone reached into Delario’s head and pulled him out of the wrecked vehicle. Doggett finds a fresh fingerprint with the blood of Ray. Agent Doggett goes to see Nora Pearce and finds Harry Odell, who employed Ray Pearce at his salvage yard. Doggett asks about Ray, but Nora insists she saw Ray die; both do not believe Ray could be involved in Curtis’s death.|$|E

5|$|During group interactions, Galapagos {{sharks are}} {{dominant}} to blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) but deferent to silvertip sharks (C. albimarginatus) of equal size. When confronted or cornered, the Galapagos shark may perform a threat display {{similar to that}} of the grey reef shark, in which the shark performs an exaggerated, rolling swimming motion while arching its back, lowering its pectoral fins, puffing out its gills, and <b>gaping</b> its jaw. The shark may also swing its head from side to side, so as to keep the perceived threat within its field of vision. A known parasite of the Galapagos shark is the flatworm Dermophthirius carcharhini, which attaches to the shark's skin. In one account, a bluefin trevally (Caranax melampygus) was seen rubbing against the rough skin of a Galapagos shark to rid itself of parasites.|$|E
5|$|Hawkins {{was officially}} {{selected}} by Geelong in the 2006 national draft under the father–son rule. Whilst many pundits lauded {{him as the}} best key position prospect within the draft, and felt Hawkins' junior performances warranted possible selection with the top overall pick, the father-son rules at the time only required Geelong to use a middle-tier third round pick to draft him. The subsequent controversy over what was widely acknowledged as a bargain gain for the Cats led to the AFL amending the father-son ruling for future use. With {{a reputation as one}} of the finest young tall forwards in the land, Hawkins was immediately billed as the successor to the legendary Gary Ablett, whose retirement ten years earlier had left a <b>gaping</b> hole in Geelongs forward line. A stress reaction injury to his right leg, however, halted Hawkins' pre-season, forcing his much-awaited debut in Geelong colours to take place in the Victorian Football League (VFL) side.|$|E

The serpent Jörmungandr opens its <b>gaping</b> maw, yawning widely in the air, and is met in combat by Thor. Thor, also a son of Odin and described here as protector of the earth, furiously fights the serpent, defeating it, but Thor is only able to take nine steps afterward before collapsing.

40|$|The pigeon's key-pecking {{response}} is experimentally dissociable into transport (head movement) and <b>gape</b> (jaw movement) components. During conditioning of the key-pecking response, both components {{come under the}} control of the conditioned stimulus. To study the acquisition of <b>gape</b> conditioned responses and to clarify the contribution of unconditioned stimulus (reinforcer) variables to the form of the response, <b>gape</b> and key-contact responses were recorded during an autoshaping procedure and reinforcer properties were systematically varied. One group of 8 pigeons was food deprived and subgroups of 2 birds each were exposed to four different pellet sizes as reinforcers, each reinforcer signaled by a keylight conditioned stimulus. A second group was water deprived and received water reinforcers paired with the conditioned stimulus. Water- or food-deprived control groups received appropriate water or food reinforcers that were randomly delivered with respect to the keylight stimulus. Acquisition of the conditioned <b>gape</b> response frequently preceded key-contact responses, and <b>gape</b> conditioned responses were generally elicited at higher rates than were key contacts. The form of the conditioned <b>gape</b> was similar to, but not identical with, the form of the unconditioned <b>gape.</b> The <b>gape</b> component is a critical topographical feature of the conditioned key peck, a sensitive measure of conditioning during autoshaping, and an important source of the observed similarities in the form of conditioned and consummatory responses...|$|R
40|$|The Rufous Bush Chat Cercotrichas galactotes is parasitized by the Cuckoo Cuculus canorus. To {{study how}} a Cuckoo elicits {{provisioning}} by this specific host species, {{the response of}} the Rufous Bush Chats to two imitations of the coloration of the <b>gape</b> of Cuckoo nestlings was tested. In pairs of experimental and control own nestlings whose <b>gapes</b> had been artificially coloured, body mass changes were recorded over 2 -hr periods. Body mass increase was used as an indicator of the amount of food provided by the parents. Both in the experimental chicks in 20 nests with <b>gapes</b> artificially coloured plain orange (imitating the coloration of the Cuckoo's <b>gape)</b> and in the experimental chicks in 18 nests with <b>gapes</b> coloured to imitate the design of the Cuckoo's <b>gape,</b> body mass increase was higher than in the controls. Experimental chicks apparently received greater amounts of food than the controls. No significant difference was detected between the effects of both experimental treatments. Therefore, in this particular gens of Cuckoo, parasitizing Rufous Bush Chats in southern Spain, either the <b>gape's</b> intense coloration or its characteristic visual pattern may act as supernormal stimuli. So far in other host species no effect of <b>gape</b> coloration has been found. The conspicuous <b>gape</b> colour and pattern could be playing a more important role stimulating food provisioning in Rufous Bush Chats than in other hosts species whose nestlings produce more begging calls. The specific coloration of the Cuckoo chick may have evolved to exploit the provisioning response of hosts towards their own nestlings. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
5|$|The {{journey to}} the waterhole is {{undertaken}} at around dawn when the air is cool. Later in the day, when the air temperature may reach over 50°C, the birds are inactive and {{have the ability to}} increase their thermal insulation when the air temperature exceeds their body temperatures. At very high temperatures they also resort to gular fluttering and <b>gaping</b> to cool themselves. At night, several flocks coalesce and fly off into the rocky desert far away from any vegetation. Each bird scrapes itself a shallow sleeping hollow by moving from side to side. There are no jerboas or other small mammals in these barren wastes so foxes and jackals do not roam there at night and the birds are safe.|$|E
5|$|Thus locked together, both captains ordered {{their ships}} to pour fire into the other. So closely aligned were they that many cannon on both ships {{could not be}} run out, and instead had to be fired from inside the ships. The heat from this {{sustained}} bombardment was so intense that the wood began to blacken and burn as heavy roundshot smashed <b>gaping</b> holes in the sides of each ship: during the combat the ragged holes torn {{in the side of}} Hercule were so extensive that the planking between the gunports was torn away, leaving wide scars along the ship's sides. Casualties were heavy on both sides: 20 minutes after the action began a musket ball struck Hood in the thigh, severing his femoral artery. Fatally wounded and bleeding profusely, Hood was carried below and command passed to Lieutenant William Butterfield. The French casualties were significantly higher than the British, a result of the much higher rate of fire achieved by Hood's well-trained crew.|$|E
5|$|Towards 15:00, {{after hours}} of resistance, the Russian army was in dire straits, but the French forces were {{exhausted}} and had neither the necessary stamina nor the necessary will to carry out another assault. At this crucial juncture, Murat's chief of staff, General Augustin Daniel Belliard rode straight to the Emperor's Headquarters and, according to General Ségur who wrote {{an account of the}} campaign, told him that the Russian line had been breached, that the road to Mozhaysk, behind the Russian line, was visible through the <b>gaping</b> hole the French attack had pierced, that an enormous crowd of runaways and vehicles were hastily retreating, and that a final push would be enough to decide the fate of the Russian army and of the war. Generals Daru, Dumas and Marshal Louis Alexandre Berthier also joined in and told the Emperor that everyone thought the time had come for the Guard to be committed to battle.|$|E
40|$|Hyolingual {{biomechanics}} and kinematics {{in three}} species of two odontocete genera were investigated to compare adaptations {{and performance of}} divergent feeding strategies. Ram and suction feeding are two ends of a continuous spectrum that is poorly-studied in odontocetes. Comparative anatomy identified characters associated with feeding patterns of morphologically dissimilar and evolutionary distant genera. Hyolingual investigations included measurements of hyolingual muscle vectors and hyoid surface area/robustness. ANOVA's revealed Kogia basihyal and thyrohyal surface areas were significantly greater than T. truncatus. However, most predicted muscle tension values {{were not significantly different}} between genera. The presence of lateral <b>gape</b> occlusions, broad basihyal and thyrohyals near the caudal oral cavity, and a broad, short tongue were likely responsible for Kogia's effective suction mechanism. These features were absent, or reduced, in T. truncatus. The feeding kinematics of dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia sima and K. breviceps), and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were characterized and compared incorporating the Ram-Suction Index (RSI). Mean RSI data support a suction feeding strategy for the phylogenetically basal Kogia (- 0. 67; S. D. ???? 0. 29) and a ram feeding strategy for the more-derived Tursiops (0. 94; S. D. ???? 0. 11). Tursiops displayed two ram-based feeding behaviors, closed <b>gape</b> approach, where <b>gape</b> increased near food items, and open <b>gape</b> approach, where <b>gape</b> was at least 50 % of maximum in the first video field. Four feeding phases were identified in both odontocetes: preparatory, jaw opening, gular depression, and jaw closing. The mean Kogia feeding cycle duration (470 ms; S. D. ???? 139) was significantly shorter (P< 0. 003) than all Tursiops groups (pooled: 863 ms; S. D. ???? 337, closed <b>gape</b> approach: 662 ms; S. D. ???? 207, open <b>gape</b> approach: 1211 ms; S. D. ???? 207). Kogia mean maximum <b>gape</b> angle (39. 8 ????; S. D. ???? 18. 9), mean maximum opening, and closing <b>gape</b> angle velocities (293 ????/s; S. D. ???? 261 and 223 ????/s; S. D. ???? 121, respectively) were significantly greater (P< 0. 005) than pooled Tursiops mean maximum <b>gape</b> angle (24. 8 ????; S. D. ???? 6. 6), mean maximum opening and closing <b>gape</b> angle velocities (84 ????/s; S. D. ???? 56 and 120 ????/s; S. D. ???? 54, respectively). Negative Kogia RSI values were correlated with increasing maximum hyoid depression and retraction, wide <b>gape</b> angle, and rapid opening <b>gape</b> velocity.

5|$|All post-1638 depictions {{appear to}} be based on earlier images, around the time reports {{mentioning}} dodos became rarer. Differences in the depictions led authors such as Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans and Masauji Hachisuka to speculate about sexual dimorphism, ontogenic traits, seasonal variation, and even the existence of different species, but these theories are not accepted today. Because details such as markings of the beak, the form of the tail feathers, and colouration vary from account to account, it is impossible to determine the exact morphology of these features, whether they signal age or sex, or if they even reflect reality. Dodo specialist Julian Hume argued that the nostrils of the living dodo would have been slits, as seen in the Gelderland, Cornelis Saftleven, Crocker Art Gallery, and Ustad Mansur images. According to this claim, the <b>gaping</b> nostrils often seen in paintings indicate that taxidermy specimens were used as models. Most depictions show that the wings were held in an extended position, unlike flighted pigeons, but similar to ratites such as the ostrich and kiwi.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have soft {{bodies with}} thin skins, and lack claws, {{defensive}} armour, or spines. Nevertheless, they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive. The {{first line of}} defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce. This keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip. The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic. Snakes have been observed yawning and <b>gaping</b> when trying to swallow African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis), which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape. Caecilians have been little studied in this respect, but the Cayenne caecilian (Typhlonectes compressicauda) produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in Brazil. In some salamanders, the skin is poisonous. The rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa) from North America {{and other members of}} its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX), the most toxic non-protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish. Handling the newts does not cause harm, but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly. In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible. The only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis).|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{cautious}} {{when approaching}} the colony and no bird likes {{to land in}} a location where other puffins are not already present. They make several circuits of the colony before alighting. On the ground they spend much time preening, spreading oil from their preen gland and setting each feather in its correct position with beak or claw. They also spend time standing by their burrow entrances and interacting with passing birds. Dominance is shown by an upright stance, with fluffed chest feathers and cocked tail, an exaggerated slow walk, head jerking and <b>gaping.</b> Submissive birds lower their head and hold their body horizontal and scurry past dominant individuals. Birds normally signal their intention to take off by briefly lowering their body before running down the slope to gain momentum. If a bird is startled and takes off unexpectedly, a panic can spread through the colony with all the birds launching themselves {{into the air and}} wheeling around in a great circle. The colony is at its most active in the evening, with birds standing outside their burrows, resting on the turf or strolling around. Then the slopes empty for the night as the birds fly out to sea to roost, often choosing to do so at fishing grounds ready for early morning provisioning.|$|E

40|$|Four pigeons responded under autoshaping {{contingencies}} {{in which}} different conditional stimuli (red or green keylights) {{were associated with}} unconditional stimuli of different magnitudes (large or small food pellets) over successive trials within a session. Both topography (beak opening or <b>gape)</b> and strength (rates and latencies of key pecks and <b>gapes)</b> of responding during the conditional stimuli depended on {{the magnitude of the}} correlated unconditional stimulus. Key-peck and <b>gape</b> rates were higher and latencies were shorter in large-pellet trials than in small-pellet trials. <b>Gape</b> amplitudes varied directly with pellet size, although conditional and unconditional <b>gapes</b> were larger than either pellet. These findings were replicated when the key colors were presented either on one or two keys and after reversals of the color-size correlations. Because the unconditional stimulus was varied through pellet size, magnitude was not confounded with food-access duration or quality. These results demonstrate the effects of the magnitude of the unconditional stimulus, in that rates and latencies of both key pecks (which are directed movements toward the key) and <b>gapes</b> (which are independent of the bird's position and key properties) varied with pellet size. <b>Gape</b> measures were unique in that two dimensions (response strength and topography) of a single response class varied simultaneously with magnitude...|$|R
50|$|Snakes {{have strong}} {{negative}} allometry for head size, meaning that head size is {{inversely related to}} body length.
