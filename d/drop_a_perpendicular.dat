50|$|Albert Einstein gave a proof by {{dissection}} {{in which}} the pieces need not get moved. Instead of using a square on the hypotenuse and two squares on the legs, one can use any other shape that includes the hypotenuse, and two similar shapes that each include one of two legs instead of the hypotenuse. In Einstein's proof, the shape that includes the hypotenuse is the right triangle itself. The dissection consists of <b>dropping</b> <b>a</b> <b>perpendicular</b> from the vertex of the right angle of the triangle to the hypotenuse, thus splitting the whole triangle into two parts. Those two parts have the same shape as the original right triangle, and have {{the legs of the}} original triangle as their hypotenuses, and the sum of their areas is that of the original triangle. Because the ratio of the area of a right triangle to the square of its hypotenuse is the same for similar triangles, the relationship between the areas of the three triangles holds for the squares of the sides of the large triangle as well.|$|R

The fish culturist can discuss his plans, projects and understand books on topography, engineering and surveying. Good fish farm construction can only be possible with the right topography. The fish culturists need to understand more principles in topography for good site selection in fish culture.

6000|$|The ridges, as {{was shown}} in the diagram (Plate 3) of the palm of the hand, run athwart the fingers in rudely {{parallel}} lines {{up to the last}} joint, and {{if it were not for}} the finger-nail, would apparently continue parallel up to the extreme finger-tip. But the presence of the nail disturbs their parallelism and squeezes them downwards on both sides of the finger. (See Fig. 8, ~2~.) Consequently, the ridges that run close to the tip are greatly arched, those that successively follow are gradually less arched until, in some cases, all signs of the arch disappear at about the level of the first joint (Fig. 8, ~1~). Usually, however, this gradual transition from an arch to a straight line fails to be carried out, causing a break in the orderly sequence, and a consequent interspace (Fig. 8, ~2~). The topmost boundary of the interspace is formed by the lowermost arch, and its lowermost boundary by the topmost straight ridge. But an equally large number of ducts exist within the interspace, as are to be found in adjacent areas of equal size, whose mouths require to be supported and connected. This is effected by the interpolation of an independent system of ridges arranged in loops (Fig. 8, ~3~; also Plate 5, Fig. 9, a, f), or in scrolls (Fig. 8, ~4~; also Fig. 9, g, h), and this interpolated system forms the [...] "pattern." [...] Now the existence of an interspace implies the divergence of two previously adjacent ridges (Fig. 8, ~2~), in order to embrace it. Just in front of the place where the divergence begins, and before the sweep of the pattern is reached, there are usually one or more very short cross-ridges. Their effect is to complete the enclosure of the minute triangular plot in question. Where there is a plot on both sides of the finger, the line that connects them (Fig. 8, ~4~) serves as a base line whereby the pattern may be oriented, and the position of any point roughly charted. Where there is a plot on only one side of the finger (Fig. 8, ~3~), the pattern has almost necessarily an axis, which serves for orientation, and the pattern can still be charted, though on a different principle, by <b>dropping</b> <b>a</b> <b>perpendicular</b> from the plot on to the axis, in the way there shown.|$|R
