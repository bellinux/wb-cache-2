40|$|Greg Janzen has {{recently}} criticised my defence of <b>Frankfurt’s</b> counterexample to the Principle of Alternate Possibilities {{by arguing that}} Jones avoids killing Smith in the counterfactual scenario.

Here I argue that Janzen’s argument fails on two counts, because his new scenario is not analogous to <b>Frankfurt’s</b> and because the agent in his new scenario does not avoid A-in...|$|R

5|$|In {{a letter}} dated 24 September 1554, Knox {{received}} {{an invitation from}} a congregation of English exiles in <b>Frankfurt</b> {{to become one of}} their ministers. He accepted the call with Calvin's blessing. But no sooner had he arrived than he found himself in a conflict. The first set of refugees to arrive in <b>Frankfurt</b> had subscribed to a reformed liturgy and used {{a modified version of the}} Book of Common Prayer. More recently arrived refugees, however, including Edmund Grindal, the future Archbishop of Canterbury, favoured a stricter application of the book. When Knox and a supporting colleague, William Whittingham, wrote to Calvin for advice, they were told to avoid contention. Knox therefore agreed on a temporary order of service based on a compromise between the two sides. This delicate balance was disturbed when a new batch of refugees arrived that included Richard Cox, one of the principal authors of the Book of Common Prayer. Cox brought Knox's pamphlet attacking the emperor to the attention of the <b>Frankfurt</b> authorities, who advised that Knox leave. His departure from <b>Frankfurt</b> on 26 March 1555 marked his final breach with the Church of England.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{examine a}} new line of {{response}} to <b>Frankfurt’s</b> challenge to the traditional association of moral responsibility with the ability to do otherwise. According to this response, <b>Frankfurt’s</b> counterexample strategy fails, not in light of the conditions for moral responsibility per se, but in view of the conditions for action. Specifically, it is claimed, a piece of behavior counts as an action only if it is within the agent’s power to avoid performing it. In so far as <b>Frankfurt’s</b> challenge presupposes that actions can be unavoidable, this view of action seems to bring his challenge up short. Helen Steward and Maria Alvarez have independently proposed versions of this response. Here I argue that this response is unavailable to <b>Frankfurt’s</b> incompatibilist opponents. This becomes evident when we put this question to its proponents: “Are actions that originate deterministically ipso facto unavoidable?” If they answer “yes,” they encounter one horn of a dilemma. If they answer “no,” they encounter the other horn. Since no one has a clearer stake in meeting <b>Frankfurt’s</b> challenge than these theorists do, it is significant that the Steward-Alvarez response is unavailable to them...|$|R
