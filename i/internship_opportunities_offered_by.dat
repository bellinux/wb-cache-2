Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 62). An <b>internship</b> is an <b>opportunity</b> <b>offered</b> <b>by</b> an employer to potential employees, called "interns", {{to work at a}} firm for a fixed, limited period of time. Interns are usually undergraduates or students, and most internships last {{for any length of time}} between one week and 12 months. Internship has various benefits such as teaching students about the industry and job practices. In my last semester of Masters in Business Administration at BRAC University, I had to do an internship program of 3 months in a reputed software company. My internship company was BRAC IT Services, or biTS. biTS is one of the biggest software firms in the country having a variety of products and services with wide range of clients. biTS has a good reputation both locally and abroad. During my internship period, I have worked on various projects. The biggest project I had worked on was the Home Banking application for the BRAC Bank Ltd. Through the course of my internship, I had to learn how to do quality test of the application to ensure an error free product for the customers all by myself. Besides, I have learned how to behave properly in the office and picked up many soft skills such as responsibility, timeliness, respecting others, taking on new challenges etc. Nushrat IslamM.
