The sample included: (1) 37 <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> rural natives (all male), (2) 125 <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> urban natives (69 male, 58 female), (3) 85 Bolivians of foreign ancestry acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> since birth (40 male, 45 female), (4) 63 Bolivians of foreign ancestry acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> during growth (30 male, 33 female), and (5) 47 non-Bolivians of either European or North American ancestry acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> during adulthood (24 male, 23 female). Results indicate that (1) all samples studied, irrespective of origin or acclimatization status, have larger lung volumes than those predicted from sea level norms; (2) the <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> rural natives have significantly greater lung volumes (vital {{capacity and}} residual lung volume) than the <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> urban natives {{and all the}} non-native <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> samples; (3) males acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> since birth or during growth attain similar lung volumes as <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> urban natives and higher residual lung volumes than subjects acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> during adulthood but lower than the <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> rural natives; (4) females acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> since birth or during growth attain similar lung volumes as subjects acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> during adulthood; (5) age at arrival to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> is inversely related to residual lung volume but not vital capacity; (6) among subjects acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> during growth, approximately 20 – 25 % of the variability in residual lung volume {{can be explained by}} developmental factors; (7) among <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> rural and urban natives, it appears that approximately 20 – 25 % of the variability in residual lung volume at <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> can be explained by genetic traits associated with skin reflectance and genetic traits shared by siblings; and (8) vital capacity, but not the residual lung volume, is inversely related to occupational activity level. Together these data suggest that the attainment of vital capacity at <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> is influenced more by environmental factors, such as occupational activity level, and body composition than developmental acclimatization. On the other hand, the attainment of an enlarged residual volume is related to both developmental acclimatization and genetic factors. Am. J. Hum.

40|$|The aerobic {{capacity}} of 268 subjects (158 males and 110 females) was evaluated in La Paz, Bolivia situated at 3, 750 m.

Data analyses indicate that 1) <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> urban natives, acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> since birth or during growth, attained higher aerobic capacity than subjects acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> during adulthood; 2) age at arrival to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> is {{inversely related to}} maximum oxygen consumption (V˙O 2 max) expressed in terms L/min or ml/min/kg of lean body mass, but {{not in terms of}} ml/min/kg of body weight; 3) among subjects acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> during growth, approximately 25 % of the variability in aerobic capacity can be explained by developmental factors; 4) as inferred from evaluations of skin color reflectance and sibling similarities, approximately 20 to 25 % of the variability in aerobic capacity at <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> can be explained by genetic factors; 5) except among the non-Bolivians acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> during adulthood, the aerobic {{capacity of}} individuals with high occupational activity level is equal to the aerobic capacity of <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> rural natives; and 6) the relationship between occupational activity level and aerobic capacity is much greater among subjects acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> before the age of 10 years than afterwards.

5|$|Another {{solution}} to the high-speed problem is the delta wing. The delta wing had {{many of the same}} advantages of the swept wing in terms of transonic and supersonic performance, but offered much more internal room and overall surface area. This provided more room for fuel, an important consideration given the inefficient early jet engines of the era, and the large wing area provided ample lift at <b>high</b> <b>altitudes.</b> The delta wing also enabled slower landings than swept wings in certain conditions. The disadvantages of the design were increased drag at lower speeds and altitudes, and especially higher drag while maneuvering. For the interceptor role these were minor concerns, as the aircraft would be spending most of its time flying in straight lines at <b>high</b> <b>altitudes</b> and speeds, mitigating these disadvantages.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Anecdotal {{historical}} {{evidence suggests that}} tuberculosis was uncommon at <b>high</b> <b>altitude,</b> but whether transmission is affected by <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> is not known. To test whether <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> lowers infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the prevalence of tuberculin skin test (TST) positivity was compared between two <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> villages (3, 340 meters [10, 960 feet] and 3, 500 meters [11, 480 feet]) and three sea-level sites in Peru. <b>High</b> <b>altitude</b> villages had lower TST-positive prevalence rates (5. 7 % and 6. 8 %) than sea level areas (25 − 33 %), and the difference remained significant (odds ratio 4. 5 − 6. 0) after adjusting for age, education, bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination, and contact with tuberculosis patients. The TST-positive individuals clustered within highland families more than within sea level families. These data suggest that prevention and control efforts targeted to families {{may be more effective}} at <b>high</b> <b>altitude.</b> The mechanism by which TST-positivity prevalence is decreased at <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> is unknown, but may reflect relative hypoxia, low humidity, or an increased ultraviolet effect...|$|R
