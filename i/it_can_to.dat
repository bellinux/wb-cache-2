25|$|After {{the success}} of the Israeli Air Force's air strike on Iraqi nuclear power plant in Osirak in 1981, Pakistan Armed Forces had been alerted since then. According to memoirs of nuclear {{strategist}} and theorist Munir Ahmad Khan, the hectic discussion took place every day between ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs, in an amid fears that India might attack Pakistan who was en route to become subsequent nuclear power. Since 1981, the commanders of the Pakistan's unified armed forces were given the standing orders to mobilize their forces at once, from all directions, as quick as <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> divert such attacks.|$|E
25|$|Socrates {{then returns}} to {{the myth of the}} chariot. The charioteer is filled with warmth and desire as he gazes into the eyes of the one he loves. The good horse is {{controlled}} by its sense of shame, but the bad horse, overcome with desire, does everything <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> go up to the boy and suggest to it the pleasures of sex. The bad horse eventually wears out its charioteer and partner, and drags them towards the boy; yet when the charioteer looks into the boy's face, his memory is carried back to the sight of the forms of beauty and self-control he had with the gods, and pulls back violently on the reins. As this occurs over and over, the bad horse eventually becomes obedient and finally dies of fright when seeing the boy's face, allowing the lover's soul to follow the boy in reverence and awe.|$|E

500|$|Realising {{that the}} Vasudan's homeworld will be hit first, the {{alliance}} does everything <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> stop the assault, despite efforts to counter this by HoL forces. Eventually, the GTA organises {{a plan to}} scan the Shivan ships planning to sweep in from one of two encroaching fronts, {{through the use of}} a captured Shivan fighter dubbed a Dragon. Much to the horror of the alliance, who had known that a Shivan destroyer named the SD Eva was to lead a small force through Deneb, the Lucifer arrives in the system as well. Despite the efforts of the GTA-PVE forces and the destruction of the Eva, the GTD Galatea is destroyed in the conflict, while the super-destroyer obliterates all opposition and bombards the Vasudan's home-planet, killing 4 billion Vasudans. As the alliance focuses on rescuing refugees and keeping the Shivans from advancing on the Terrans' homeworld in the Sol system, a small Vasudan refugee fleet that managed to escape sends out a transmission revealing that they were forced to land on an uncharted planet in the Altair system. There, they discover the remnants of a long-extinct alien civilization dubbed [...] "the Ancients", a species that amassed a vast galactic empire before they were wiped out by the Shivans. Much of the Ancients' backstory is told through cutscenes at various points in the campaign, including their rise, encounter with the Shivans, retreat, destruction of their homeworld, and complete extermination.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Polygon, Eric Watson {{said that}} [...] "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s fourth season pulls the best {{elements}} from the MCU {{and the most}} over-the-top elements from comics to remind me why I love Marvel: superheroes punching Nazis." [...] He said this was refreshing after the controversial comic storyline Secret Empire which sees the patriotic Captain America revealed to be a sleeper agent for Hydra. Carli Velocci at TheWrap also discussed the season in relation to Secret Empire, noting that Agents of Hydra [...] "hasn’t spawned a digital mountain of outrage" [...] like the commic event. She said that Secet Empire [...] "all but ignores [...] real world context, minus acknowledging that Nazis tend to like concentration camps. If anything, it treats the subject matter like window dressing, background for a plot intended to blow readers’ minds ... Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, however, embraces that real world context. It does everything <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the real world still matters and that the audience understands {{the negative consequences of}} a Nazi-driven society. And unlike the comic book counterpart, it doesn’t shy away from the fact that Hydra is definitely rooted in the Third Reich." [...] She continued that the series [...] "manages to create a world where Hydra is the establishment, but every other plot point is about questioning it explicitly" [...] and [...] "what’s more inspiring than seeing an actual symbol of America not taking crap from Nazis? Wherever the comic series takes Captain America, it shouldn’t have lost sight of that. Fortunately, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. didn’t." ...|$|E
