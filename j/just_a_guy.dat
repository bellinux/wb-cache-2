500|$|When Mears went to {{audition}} for the role, he was asked, [...] "Why do we need an actor as opposed to <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> in a mask?" [...] Mears said portraying Jason is similar to Greek Mask Work, in which the mask and the actor are separate entities, and depending on the scene, there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance. Mears said the energy from the actor's thoughts will {{be picked up by}} the camera. He compared his experience behind the camera to a stock car race: he is the driver and the effects team is his pit crew. As he performs, the effects team subtly suggest ways he can give the character more life on camera.|$|E

2500|$|Death is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most influential bands in heavy metal and a pioneering force in death metal. Scream Bloody Gore is widely regarded as the first death metal album, and Schuldiner is acknowledged as the originator of extreme metal. Music biographer Garry Sharpe-Young considered Death [...] "a genre-breaking band centered upon frontman Chuck Schuldiner" [...] and that the band [...] "would become one of the prime instigators of the death metal movement". However, Schuldiner dismissed such attributions by stating, in an interview with Metal-Rules.com, [...] "I don't think I should take the credits for this death metal stuff. I'm <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> from a band, and I think Death is a metal band". In Death's later music, the band's music became more technical, moving to a more technical death metal style. In January 2001, Mahyar Dean, an Iranian musician, wrote Death, a book about Death and Schuldiner and released it in Iran. The book includes bilingual lyrics and many articles about the band. The book was sent through the site keepers of emptywords.org to Schuldiner, who in his words was [...] "truly blown away and extremely honored by the obvious work and devotion he put into bringing the book to life".|$|E

[...] "We talked about {{the world we live in}} and the issues that face our culture. Issues such as political propaganda, a sensationalist media, blind faith and micro-macrocosm were a few of the things we discussed. We liked the idea of a man with his back turned to the world, in a white blank room." [...] The concept was further discussed on his web page. [...] "Is the whiteness purity and peace that he seeks, or the stark cold white of a mental ward? [...] "It's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> who has had enough, everything has gotten too heavy and he needs a break from it all. He hasn't given up or surrendered, just created an enlightened microcosm.
