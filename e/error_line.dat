In addition to the localized jump method described above, there exists a second algorithm for choosing K using the same transformed distortion values known as the broken line method. The broken line method identifies the jump point in the graph of the transformed distortion by doing a simple least squares <b>error</b> <b>line</b> fit of two line segments, which in theory will fall along the x-axis for K < G, and along the linearly increasing phase of the transformed distortion plot for K &ge; G.

40|$|Abstract—In an RFID system, {{far field}} passive tags send {{information}} to the reader using back scattering. The signal strength of RFID tags is much smaller {{than that of a}} reader. So the channel condition significantly affects the tags ’ identification performance. Although there are 4 line codes in EPCglobal C 1 G 2, how to decide an appropriate line code is not specified. If the line codes can be adaptively decided by the channel condition, the performance of identification is increased. In this paper, we propose a novel line code decision protocol to measure the channel conditions and adaptively change the line code at every slot. We show that the performance of RFID identification is enhanced using our line code decision protocol via analysis and simulation. Index Terms—Anti-collision, channel <b>error,</b> <b>line</b> code, RFID. be used during an identification round can be specified by a reader in EPCglobal C 1 G 2. However, how line codes are utilized is not presented in the specification. In this paper, we investigate the performance of EPCglobal C 1 G 2 using FM 0 and Miller codes in the practical channel environment. In order to improve the performance of EPCglobal C 1 G 2 in a practical channel environment, we propose a novel line code decision protocol that can estimate the channel condition and adapt the line code to the channel at each transmission of tags, which has not been investigated yet, to our best knowledge. We also present the performance analysis of our proposed scheme in a practical air interface environment. I...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} study, several new algorithms are developed to achieve spacecraft attitude determination from carrier phase information of GPS (Global Positioning System) signals. The first {{focus is on}} resolving integer ambiguity in carrier phase difference measurements. A newly developed algorithm based on Gram-Schmidt Orthonormalisation (GSO) is proposed for medium length baseline observations. Using this newly developed attitude algorithm from vector observations, an instantaneous estimated attitude solution is obtained, which we call 'coarse attitude', from only four phase measurements collected from only two baseline observations. Then a 'fine' attitude solution from all phase measurements is estimated, using a sophisticated Kalman filtering estimator, once integer ambiguity has been resolved. The second focus is on estimating the relative phase offset <b>error</b> (<b>line</b> bias) in carrier phase difference measurements. A newly developed block bias search is proposed which finds an initially plausible solution of line bias for each individual baseline. The line bias from all phase measurements collected from each individual baseline is then re-estimated using a developed recursive least squares (RLS) estimator. A newly developed parallel architecture GPS receiver is being flown on the UoSat- 12 minisatellite, with the capability for simultaneous measurements from 24 channels for attitude sensing. The final goal of {{this research}} study was to apply the developed algorithms to real GPS data, {{and a number of}} data files of phase differences of GPS signals logged on UoSat- 12 were tested. Independent ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control System) data was used for the reference attitude determination. The results show that an instantaneous attitude error less than 4 degrees is achieved during coarse attitude acquisition, relative to the reference ADCS system. When all measurements are processed during fine attitude tracking, the error in attitude estimation is reduced to one degree error (1 sigma RMS), without any error mitigation for multipath, relative to the reference ADCS system...|$|E
