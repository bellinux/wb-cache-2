The initial boxing sequences were shot from a spectator's view outside of the ring but later sequences were filmed more intimately from inside the ring. Cinematographer Patrick Cady used camera rigs that allowed the actors to hit him or the camera itself to mimic the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> hit.|$|E
5|$|In Retford, MacMillan was {{introduced}} to ballet by a local dance teacher, Jean Thomas. He had already had lessons in Scottish dancing in Dunfermline and tap dancing in Great Yarmouth, and he took to ballet immediately. In 1942 his mother died, which caused him acute and lasting distress. His father was a distant figure, and the boy's only close family relationship was with an elder sister. His obituarist in The Times suggests that the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> an outsider, displayed in many of MacMillan's ballets, had its roots in his childhood.|$|E

The second regret was {{that he and his wife}} had been unable to have children. They unofficially adopted a succession of poor boys and paid for their education. At least one of them became a priest and was ordained by Henson.|$|E

Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E

I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> incomplete, and I need to find myself.

5|$|Clark {{was born}} Wesley Kanne in Chicago on December 23, 1944. His father Benjamin died on December 6, 1948; his mother then moved {{the family to}} Little Rock, Arkansas. This move was made {{for a variety of}} reasons, {{including}} escaping the greater cost of living in a large city such as Chicago, the support Veneta's family in Arkansas could provide, and her <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> an outsider to the remaining Kanne family as she did not share their religion. Once in Little Rock, Veneta married Viktor Clark, whom she met while working as a secretary at a bank. Viktor raised Wesley as his son, and officially adopted him on Wesley's 16th birthday. Wesley's name was changed to Wesley Kanne Clark. Viktor Clark's name actually replaced that of Wesley's biological father on his birth certificate, something Wesley would later say that he wished they had not done. Veneta raised Wesley without telling him of his Jewish ancestry to protect him from the anti-Jewish activities of the Ku Klux Klan in the southern U.S. Although his mother was Methodist, Clark chose a Baptist church after moving to Little Rock and continued attending it throughout his childhood.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{examined}} the independent prognostic {{value of the}} four subscales of the Heart Patients Psychological Questionnaire (HPPQ) on mortality in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) survivors up to 8 years after the event. METHODS: The HPPQ, which measures well-being, <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> disabled, despondency and social inhibition, was administered to 567 AMI patients during hospitalisation and at 3 months follow-up. The patients were followed for 8 years. RESULTS: During follow-up, 157 patients (28 %) died. Forty-one {{percent of the patients}} had a score indicating at least mild to moderate <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> disabled. Patients with <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> disabled were at increased risk of mortality compared with those having a low score, adjusted for other cardiac risk factors [hazard ratio (HR) = 1. 8, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 3 - 2. 5]. There was no interaction between <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> disabled and gender. None of the other HPPQ subscales were related to mortality or recurrent myocardial infarction (MI). When the study population was stratified by low and high clinical risk (43 % vs. 57 %, respectively), <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> disabled was the most prominent predictor of mortality in the low-risk group (HR= 3. 5, 95 % CI= 1. 4 - 8. 8). CONCLUSION: <b>Feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> disabled measured at baseline and at 3 months was the most prominent predictor of mortality in low-risk patients 8 years post-MI. This finding adds to the existing knowledge that psychosocial variables influence morbidity and mortality in cardiac patients...|$|R
5|$|Rocksteady {{intended}} for Batman, Catwoman, and Robin to offer three different playing experiences. Other villains from Batman's comic history {{were selected to}} show that the prison was a melting pot of people from Gotham. The developers believed that providing a small part of each villain's story rather than focusing on a select few allowed the player to meet many more characters and effectively conveyed the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> in a superprison filled with supervillains. Rocksteady decided early on that the Joker would die in the story, and developed the idea of him poisoning Batman with the same affliction, in order to show how the two diametrically opposed characters would interact in pursuit of a shared goal. Warner Bros. and Dini did not oppose killing off the character {{as long as it was}} not done for shock value, and as long as they made it clear that Batman was not at fault, since he would not intentionally kill someone.|$|E

40|$|It {{remains unclear}} whether <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> {{disabled}} are a relevant psychological factor that determines long term outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Therefore, we evaluated 'feelings <b>of</b> <b>being</b> disabled' {{as an independent}} risk factor for mortality 12 years post-PCI. The study population comprised a consecutive series of CAD patients (n= 845) treated with PCI {{as part of the}} Taxus-Stent Evaluated At Rotterdam Cardiology Hospital (T-SEARCH) registry. Of these patients n= 646 (age 63 years, 75 % male) completed the subscale 'feelings <b>of</b> <b>being</b> disabled' <b>of</b> the Heart Patients Psychological Questionnaire (HPPQ), within the first month after PCI. At 12 year follow-up, n= 209 patients (32 %) died. Of the 162 females n= 73 (45 %) experienced high <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> disabled (High-FOBD) and of the 484 males, n= 134 (28 %) reported high-FOBD. Patients with high <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> disabled had a two-fold increased risk of mortality at 12 -year follow-up (HR= 1. 86, 95 % CI= 1. 41 - 2. 45). After adjusting, high <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> disabled remained a predictor of 12 -year mortality (HR= 2. 53, 95 % CI= 1. 30 - 4. 90). This study confirms that psychosocial variables like <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> disabled influence cardiac morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, there is no difference in mortality between men and women with high <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> disabled 12 years post-PCI. It is important that clinicians are aware that PCI-patients who feel disabled have a less favorable survival and that the difference in survival is even greater for women who feel disable...|$|R

Like auditory hallucinations, the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject's back. Their visual counterpart is the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> looked or stared at, usually with malicious intent.

40|$|Why do {{we enjoy}} {{listening}} to music that makes us sad? This question has puzzled music psychologists for decades, but the paradox of “pleasurable sadness” remains to be solved. Recent findings from a study investigating the enjoyment of sad films suggest that the positive relationship between felt sadness and enjoyment might be explained by <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> moved (Hanich et al., 2014). The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> moved also mediated the enjoyment of sad music. In Experiment 1, 308 participants listened to five sad music excerpts and rated their liking and felt emotions. A multilevel mediation analysis revealed that the initial positive relationship between liking and felt sadness (r = 0. 22) was fully mediated by <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> moved. Experiment 2 explored the interconnections of perceived sadness, beauty, and movingness in 27 short music excerpts that represented independently varying levels of sadness and beauty. Two multilevel mediation analyses were carried out to test competing hypotheses: (A) that movingness mediates the effect of perceived sadness on liking, or (B) that perceived beauty mediates the effect of sadness on liking. Stronger support was obtained for Hypothesis A. Our findings suggest that – similarly to the enjoyment of sad films – the aesthetic appreciation of sad music is mediated by being moved. We argue that felt sadness may contribute to the enjoyment of sad music by intensifying <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> moved...|$|R
