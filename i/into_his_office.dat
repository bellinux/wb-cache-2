5|$|Shortly {{after being}} hired {{he was taken}} aside by the news {{producer}} and asked to read the on-air bulletin for the nightly broadcast. He read the news for three months until one night when he condensed a six-minute bulletin into three minutes. He attributed this to stage fright, which caused him to speak too fast. The rest of the production crew were not {{ready to move on}} to the next news items, leaving Harries standing in silence for several minutes. Harries recalled in a 2007 interview that Steve Morrison, the producer of the bulletin, called him <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> and berated him, telling him he did not deserve to be on television and that he would no longer be reading the news. Morrison's remarks angered Harries to such a point that he assaulted the man. Aware that he was going to lose his job, he contacted a Granada colleague who got him a new job at Granada's London centre, which he took up at the age of 23.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, an {{increasingly}} power-hungry Vogel plans to destroy The Saints {{so he can}} expand Ultor's control over all of Stilwater.

This dislike intensifies during visits from his accountant and one of his tenants, both of whom are allied with the Redshirts. Both of them assure the Prince that the unification of Italy will be peaceful and will benefit everyone, including the nobility. The Prince allows himself to be reassured, certain that the class system will remain unchanged no matter what. The Prince's visit to the Salina chaplain, Father Pirrone, atop a tower where the men practice their joint hobby of astronomy, reinforces this belief.|$|E

25|$|The {{day after}} the decision, Gould says, Truesdale came <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> and {{subjected}} him to loud verbal abuse (which devolved into a shouting match) because Truesdale was upset that Gould had spoken to the New York Times about the Board's decision. Gould lunched with Mikva after the incident, at which time Mikva allegedly counseled Gould to allow Truesdale and the other Board members to write opinions supporting their votes in this high-profile case. Gould was unwilling to do this, and told Mikva that Truesdale was too deferential to the General Counsel's requests to make that a valuable exercise. On March 28, Gould learned that Truesdale was about to publish comments critical of Gould's contacts with the press during the baseball strike. Gould asked Mikva if the White House {{would be willing to}} privately discipline Truesdale, but Mikva indicated it would not.|$|E
25|$|Sunder Singh Lyallpuri had {{received}} his basic education in Shahkot (Pakistan) and then obtained B.A. (Honours) from Khalsa College Amritsar and B.T. from Government College Lahore. Lyallpuri was invited for personal interview {{for the position}} of tehsildar (revenue officer) but he sat in {{chair in front of}} Commissioner without his permission. This caused a verbal scuffle between him and the English officer so that he was sent back without being interviewed. On pressure from his relatives, he later took a position in Indian postal services but here too he was entangled with his English boss. The senior officer called him <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> for inquiry and did not offer him a chair to sit on which again hurt the pride of Sunder Singh.

25|$|In 1896, {{three years}} after {{submitting}} his thesis on the Kerr effect, he disobeyed the direct orders of his supervisor and used laboratory equipment to measure the splitting of spectral lines by a strong magnetic field. He was fired for his efforts, but he was later vindicated: he won the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of what has now {{become known as the}} Zeeman effect. As an extension of his thesis research, he began investigating the effect of magnetic fields on a light source. He discovered that a spectral line is split into several components {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field. Lorentz first heard about Zeeman's observations on Saturday 31 October 1896 at the meeting of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in Amsterdam, where these results were communicated by Kamerlingh Onnes. The next Monday, Lorentz called Zeeman <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> and presented him with an explanation of his observations, based on Lorentz's theory of electromagnetic radiation.|$|E
