5|$|It was {{the first}} LS with {{continuous}} controlled Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). The addition of an automated parallel parking assist feature, {{the first of its}} kind in the U.S., allowed the LS 460 to steer itself into preselected parking spaces. Other drive-assist features included a brake-hold system, radar cruise control, electric variable gear ratio power steering, and electronically controlled braking. The new stability control system was improved to anticipate skids and alter steering assist and gear ratios. The suite of new safety features extended from an eye-tracking <b>Driver</b> <b>Monitoring</b> System to a lane departure warning system. The pre-collision system added the first production image processing chip in a car capable of identifying vehicles and pedestrians in real time, along with millimeter-wavelength radar, stereo cameras, and infrared night vision projectors. A rear pre-collision system with whiplash-preventing active seat headrests and dual-chamber front airbags was also introduced.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{features}} on Lexus models range from {{stability and handling}} programs (Vehicle Stability Control and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management) to backup cameras, swivel headlights, and sonar warning systems. The Lexus Pre-Collision System (PCS) integrates multiple safety systems. In 2007, Lexus introduced the first car safety systems with infrared and pedestrian detection capabilities, lane keep assist, a <b>Driver</b> <b>Monitoring</b> System with facial recognition monitoring of driver attentiveness, and rear pre-collision whiplash protection, {{as part of the}} LS 460 PCS. As a safety precaution, Lexus GPS navigation systems in many regions feature a motion lockout when the vehicle reaches a set speed; to prevent distraction, navigation inputs are limited, while voice input and certain buttons are still accessible. This safety feature has attracted criticism because passengers cannot use certain functions when the vehicle is in motion. Pre-2007 models came with a hidden manufacturer override option, and updated European models allow operation in motion.|$|E

40|$|Every year, many car {{accidents}} due to driver fatigue and distraction occur {{around the world}} and cause many casualties and injuries. <b>Driver</b> face <b>monitoring</b> systems {{is one of the main}} approaches for driver fatigue or distraction detection and accident prevention. <b>Driver</b> face <b>monitoring</b> systems capture the images from driver face and extract the symptoms of fatigue and distraction from eyes, mouth and head. These symptoms are usually percentage of eyelid closure over time (PERCLOS), eyelid distance, eye blink rate, blink speed, gaze direction, eye saccadic movement, yawning, head nodding and head orientation. The system estimates driver alertness based on extracted symptoms and alarms if needed. In this paper, after an introduction to <b>driver</b> face <b>monitoring</b> systems, the general structure of these systems is discussed. Then a comprehensive review on <b>driver</b> face <b>monitoring</b> systems for fatigue and distraction detection is presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to bring {{together}} multiple literature sources which present innovative methodologies for the assessment of driver state, driving context and performance by means of technology within a vehicle and consumer electronic devices. It also provides an overview of ongoing research and trends in the area of <b>driver</b> state <b>monitoring.</b> As part of this review a model of a hybrid <b>driver</b> state <b>monitoring</b> system is proposed. The model incorporates technology within a vehicle and multiple broughtin devices for enhanced validity and reliability of recorded data. Additionally, the model draws upon requirement of data fusion in order to generate unified driver state indicator(-s) that could be used to modify in-vehicle information and safety systems hence, make them driver state adaptable. Such modification could help to reach optimal driving performance in a particular driving situation. To conclude, we discuss the advantages of integrating hybrid <b>driver</b> state <b>monitoring</b> system into a vehicle and suggest future areas of research...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Driver</b> <b>Monitoring</b> System, {{also known}} as Driver Attention Monitor, is a vehicle safety system first {{introduced}} by Toyota in 2006 for its and Lexus latest models. It was first offered in Japan on the GS 450h. The system's functions co-operate with the Pre-Collision System (PCS). The system uses infrared sensors to monitor driver attentiveness. Specifically, the <b>Driver</b> <b>Monitoring</b> System includes a CCD camera placed on the steering column which is capable of eye tracking, via infrared LED detectors. [...] If the driver is {{not paying attention to}} the road ahead and a dangerous situation is detected, the system will warn the driver by flashing lights, warning sounds. If no action is taken, the vehicle will apply the brakes (a warning alarm will sound followed by a brief automatic application of the braking system).

However, when problems arise such as car trouble, it is difficult for the drivers to take action immediately. In addition, maintenance personnel have to manually save data one by one after storing the vehicle to analyze control information of the main devices such as the brake controller and auxiliary power. To improve these points, a system that sends and receives all information in real time should be estab-lished by installing a sensor communication network and a surveillance system. This study attempts to improve the safet...|$|R
