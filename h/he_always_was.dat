25|$|Actually, Pobedonostsev's {{ascension}} in {{the first}} days after the assassination of Alexander II resulted in the subsequent resignation of Loris-Melikov and other ministers eager for liberal reforms. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>was</b> an uncompromising conservative and never shrank from boldly expressing his staunch opinions. Consequently, in liberal circles he was always denounced as an obscurantist, pedant, and an enemy of progress.|$|E

He affected a posture of self-confidence and eccentricity. He often was arrogant and selfish toward friends and patrons. A constant self-promoter and egoist, he relished shocking friends and enemies. Though he could be droll and flippant about social and political matters, <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>was</b> serious about art and often invited public controversy and debate to argue for his strongly held theories.|$|E
500|$|During George II's reign British {{interests}} expanded {{throughout the}} world, the Jacobite {{challenge to the}} Hanoverian dynasty was extinguished, {{and the power of}} ministers and Parliament in Britain became well-established. Nevertheless, in the memoirs of contemporaries such as Lord Hervey and Horace Walpole, George is depicted as a weak buffoon, governed by his wife and ministers. Biographies of George written during the nineteenth and first part of the twentieth century relied on these biased accounts. Since {{the last quarter of the}} twentieth century, scholarly analysis of surviving correspondence has indicated that George was not as ineffective as previously thought. Letters from ministers are annotated by George with pertinent remarks and demonstrate that he had a grasp of and interest in foreign policy in particular. He was often able to prevent the appointment of ministers or commanders he disliked, or sideline them into lesser offices. This academic reassessment of George II, however, has not totally eliminated the popular perception of him as a [...] "faintly ludicrous king". His parsimony, for example, may have opened him to ridicule, but his biographers observe that parsimony is preferable to extravagance. Lord Charlemont excused George's short temper by explaining that sincerity of feeling is better than deception, [...] "His temper was warm and impetuous, but he was good-natured and sincere. Unskilled in the royal talent of dissimulation, <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>was</b> what he appeared to be. He might offend, but he never deceived." [...] Lord Waldegrave wrote, [...] "I am thoroughly convinced that hereafter, when time shall have wore away those specks and blemishes which sully the brightest characters, and from which no man is totally exempt, he will be numbered amongst those patriot kings, under whose government the people have enjoyed the greatest happiness". George may not have played a strong role in history, but he was influential at times and he upheld constitutional government. Elizabeth Montagu said of him, [...] "With him our laws and liberties were safe, he possessed in a great degree the confidence of his people and the respect of foreign governments; and a certain steadiness of character made him of great consequence in these unsettled times... His character would not afford subject for epic poetry, but will look well in the sober page of history." ...|$|E

His body was recovered an hour later, and he was confirmed dead. Budd's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Tootal, described Budd {{at the time of}} his death as [...] "an outstanding leader" [...] who had a professional manner [...] "that inspired confidence in all that worked with him". Tootal said: [...] "Bryan died doing the job he loved, leading his men from the front, where <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>was.</b> He was proud to call himself a paratrooper and we were proud to stand beside him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 1938 memoirs, Dew recalled:"I {{had landed}} on July 29 by the liner Laurentic, {{arriving}} {{two days before}} the Montrose, which was already well out in the Atlantic when we first suspected that Crippen was aboard, but which was a much slower vessel than the mail steamer Laurentic. Old Crippen took it quite well. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>was</b> a bit of a philosopher, though he could not have helped being astounded to see me on board the boat. He was quite a likeable chap in his way. Much of my time in Canada was spent evading reporters and cameramen, who knew all about my arrival in spite of our efforts to keep it secret, and who frequently became personal when I did not give them a statement. As it happened, Crippen and his companion, Miss Ethel Le Neve, showed no desire to postpone our departure and waived their extradition rights, which enabled us to make the return journey after being only three weeks in Canada." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most of Ribbentrop's {{time was}} spent either {{demanding}} that Britain sign the Anti-Comintern Pact or that London return the former German colonies in Africa. But he also devoted considerable time to courting {{what he called the}} [...] "men of influence" [...] as the best way to achieve an Anglo-German alliance. Ribbentrop believed the British aristocracy comprised some sort of secret society that ruled from behind the scenes, and if he could befriend enough members of Britain's [...] "secret government", he could bring about the alliance. Almost all of the initially favourable reports Ribbentrop provided to Berlin about the alliance's prospects were based on friendly remarks about the [...] "New Germany" [...] that came from British aristocrats such as Lord Londonderry and Lord Lothian; the rather cool reception that Ribbentrop received from British Cabinet ministers and senior bureaucrats did not make much of an impression on him at first. In their view, summarised by Viscount Cranborne, <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>was</b> a second rate man.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1970, {{after one}} season at Miami, Bo Schembechler offered Burton an {{assistant}} coaching position at Michigan, and Burton accepted. [...] Despite his {{strong ties to}} Miami, Burton recalled {{that he could not}} pass on the opportunity to coach at Michigan: [...] "I left Miami to coach at Michigan because of the challenge and an upward move in the profession." [...] Burton remained an assistant coach at Michigan for 22 years from 1970 to 1991. He began in 1970 as the coach of the freshman football team, coached receivers from 1972 to 1980 and then took over as the running backs coach from 1980 to 1992. [...] Burton was the position coach for All-American receivers Jim Smith and Anthony Carter and to running back Jamie Morris. [...] In 1990, Burton said that Morris was favorite Michigan player. Morris gave credit to Burton for his development: [...] "Tirrel was everything to me. He was like my father and mother. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>was</b> in my corner. Bo would get on me, and he would take some of the blame for me. He handled each individual the way he needed to be handled." [...] Burton reported that coaching under Schembechler had been a huge honor: [...] "Bo Schembechler was a great coach. He was from the same mold as Ara ... Bo was demanding of his coaches and his players. I learned most of what I know about football from Bo." ...|$|E
