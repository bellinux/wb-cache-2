25|$|Scotland started well in Bridgend with Wade Liddell {{giving the}} Bravehearts the lead after just 8 minutes. This try was {{converted}} by Gareth Morton. But things <b>got</b> <b>bad</b> as Wales pulled a try back through Richard Johnson, and then Danny Brough was sinbinned for dissent on 26 minutes. In {{the next ten}} minutes a Wales team minus Iestyn Harris, who failed a fitness test prior to the match, capitalised on Scotland's shortfall and scored two tries to create a 14–6 lead going into half-time. However, after the break the Scots immediately {{got back into the}} match, Danny Brough singlehandedly scoring a try after 70 seconds of the interval, and Jamie Benn a little later leeching on to a grubber kick. Mick Nanyn missed both conversions and so the scores were tied. On the 67th minute Scotland went in front, Nanyn converting his own try. And to seal a 21–14 victory Danny Brough scored a drop-goal. He would later get Man of the Match award.|$|E

500|$|The season saw {{drastic changes}} to the series' alien mythology. In the premiere episode, [...] "Herrenvolk", Williams—the actor who played Mulder's {{informant}} X—was written out of the show. He said that, [...] "Carter called me up personally [...] 'Got good news, <b>got</b> <b>bad</b> news. The good news is we're gonna bring you up for another episode this week. The bad news is you're gonna take a bullet." [...] The writers created a new character, Marita Covarrubias, to function as Mulder's informant. Carter felt it would be [...] "more interesting for Mulder's next contact to be a woman", noting that he [...] "wanted there to be some suspicion about whether Mulder would become involved with her romantically. [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] also introduced the killer bees, who {{would go on to}} play a larger part in the 1998 film. Carter described the fourth season as [...] "maybe the most intense and difficult season of the show." ...|$|E

500|$|Sinclair {{himself said}} in 2005 that the C5 [...] "was early {{for what it}} was. People reacted {{negatively}} and the press didn't help. It was too low down and people felt insecure, hence it <b>got</b> <b>bad</b> press." [...] Sam Dawson of Classic and Sport Car Magazine described the C5 as [...] "incredibly fun to drive", suggesting that the safety concerns [...] "could have been addressed if it wasn't {{for the fact that}} it was already doomed as a national joke." [...] He noted the disconnect between the media's expectations of a serious electric car and the reality of the C5, which he called [...] "just a fun way of getting around". Professor Stuart Cole of the University of South Wales comments that the C5 suffered from the design of the roads and the attitudes of the time, which were not geared towards pedal or electric vehicles: [...] "In the days before unleaded petrol, your face would have been at the height of every exhaust pipe, and drivers weren't used to having to consider slower-moving cyclists. But with more cycle lanes, better education, and workplaces providing showers, etc., the world now is much more geared up for people looking for alternatives to the car, and hopefully will become even more so in the future." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} this {{negative}} publicity, New York's assembly in April passed a bill pardoning the New Hampshire grantees of offenses they may have committed, and recognizing, without requiring additional payment, the New Hampshire grants and those issued later by the Vermont Republic. [...] This appeared to clear the significant legal roadblocks to Vermont's statehood, but the east side Yorkers {{continued to be a}} persistent problem, with Governor Clinton almost encouraging them to engage in acts of resistance against the Vermont administration, even issuing commissions for New York judicial positions covering the affected area. [...] The situation <b>got</b> <b>bad</b> enough that Ethan Allen, in some secrecy, raised 250 men and marched on the town of Guilford, which was the epicenter of Yorker activity. [...] This resulted in the arrest, trial, and banishment of the Yorker ringleaders in October 1782, and the seizure of some of their property. [...] This prompted Congress to demand that Vermont compensate the affected individuals.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the first}} ever SummerSlam, The Mega Powers teamed up against André the Giant and Ted DiBiase, The Mega Bucks with Savage's former tag-team partner Jesse [...] "The Body" [...] Ventura as the special guest referee. Most of the pre-match {{build-up}} centered on Elizabeth, who by this time was {{at the peak of}} her popularity. The tease for the match was that if things <b>got</b> <b>bad,</b> Elizabeth, billed as the secret weapon of The Mega Powers, was going to wear sexy red panties under her fancy clothes. Towards the end of match, André and Dibiase were in control, so Elizabeth got up on the apron and ripped her skirt off to reveal her underwear which distracted André, Dibiase and Ventura, giving Savage and Hogan time to recover after being knocked out of the ring. The Mega Powers quickly took advantage of the situation and won the match after Ventura made a reluctant three-count (Savage rode Ventura's arm down to the mat to finalize the count).|$|E
2500|$|When casting for the film, Iliadis {{wanted to}} find actors who would not portray these {{characters}} in a stereotypical way. As Craven explains, they wanted someone who would take these characters {{in a direction that}} most actors would not—they wanted originality. Craven states, [...] "You need an actor who can bring a complete sense of commitment to that character without making it silly and not be afraid to go in there to the point where someone might say, 'Oh, you <b>got</b> <b>bad</b> in you?' You have to be brave enough and mature enough to know we've all got it, and you're not afraid of putting it out there and if you've got a problem with seeing that, tough." [...] For instance, Iliadis wanted to avoid casting some superficially sexy actress in the role of Mari, because he did not want the rape sequence to appear enjoyable to the viewers in any possible way. Iliadis notes that when Sara Paxton came in her audition was [...] "good", but it was this sense of intelligence and intensity that Paxton brought with her. The actress also had the [...] "innocent face" [...] the director was looking for, someone who had this [...] "wholesomely American look" [...] that would not allow anyone to enjoy watching her go through these intense events.|$|E
2500|$|The {{month of}} June {{began with the}} Nationals taking {{two out of three}} in interleague play visiting the Oakland Athletics. Outfielder Brian Goodwin struck his first major league home run off Athletics {{reliever}} Zach Neal on June 2, a two-run shot over the high wall in Oakland Coliseum's right-center field. Starting pitcher Joe Ross's place in the rotation was unclear after a second consecutive losing start in which he failed to go more than four innings, as he gave up seven runs in three innings of a 10–4 loss to the Athletics on June 3. The Nationals also <b>got</b> <b>bad</b> news on injured outfielder Chris Heisey, as he was evaluated after a short rehab assignment and shut down due to swelling in his arm after he ruptured a biceps tendon the previous month, with manager Dusty Baker telling media that Heisey [...] "might have rushed it a little sooner than he should have". On June 4, the Nationals defeated Oakland 11–10, but the win brought up fresh concerns about the team's bullpen after closer Koda Glover and reliever Shawn Kelley combined to allow six earned runs {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning, including four on a grand slam home run by Matt Joyce off Kelley, before Kelley locked down the save. Outfielder Jayson Werth was placed on the 10-day disabled list after fouling a ball off his foot in the June 3 game, and the Nationals selected the contract of veteran utilityman Ryan Raburn on June 5 as they headed into a three-game series with the Los Angeles Dodgers, their first meeting with the Dodgers since the 2016 National League Division Series, to take over for Werth in left field. Minor league pitcher Rafael Martin was designated for assignment to make room for Raburn on the 40-man roster.|$|E
