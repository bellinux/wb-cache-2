5|$|Several modern {{historians have}} also praised the {{operation}} and the improvements that were made for Varsity. G. G. Norton argued that the operation benefited from the lessons learned from previous operations, and Brian Jewell agrees, arguing that the lessons of Market Garden had been learned as the airborne forces were concentrated and quickly dropped, giving the defenders little time to recover. Norton also argues that improvements were made for supporting the airborne troops; he notes {{that a large number}} of artillery pieces were available to cover the landings and that observers were dropped with the airborne forces, thus augmenting the firepower and flexibility of the airborne troops. He also highlights the development of a technique that allowed entire brigades to be landed in tactical groups, giving them greater flexibility. Dropping the airborne forces after the ground forces had breached the Rhine also ensured that the airborne troops would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> long before being relieved, a major improvement on the manner in which the previous large-scale airborne operation, Market Garden, had been conducted.|$|E

[...] The singer also decided to record [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] {{because she wanted to}} shift her focus to the beauty industry, which she felt was [...] "the most humiliating, judgmental place you can be as a woman". She saw the track's theme as representation of [...] "finding that thing in the world that makes you truly happy," [...] and felt that the song was in line with the album's theme of [...] "finding beauty in imperfections". Speaking to iTunes Radio, Beyoncé explained: [...] "I feel like sometimes the world is a big contest, we're all being judged. I wanted to capture how humiliating and insecure that makes you feel." ...|$|E

500|$|Four days later, Benfica hosted Braga, {{who were}} searching for their first win of April. Benfica enjoyed a slight superiority {{throughout}} the match but could not surpass Braga's defence. Paulo Santos ended the game unbeaten. The third consecutive draw had negative consequences for the league race; Porto increased their lead to five points and Sporting climbed to second place in exchange for Benfica after recovering five points {{in the past three}} matchdays. Santos accepted the title was no longer an objective, saying, [...] "We are not mathematically removed from it, but we are clearly very far from winning it...Now we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> second place, because it is crucial." [...] On 21 April, Benfica travelled to Funchal to play Marítimo. Miccoli was essential in Benfica's game, scoring the first tow goals in a 3–0 win, the first in April for Benfica. For their last match of April, Benfica received Sporting at home. Without Simão, who was injured, Benfica suffered an early setback when Liédson scored for Sporting in the second minute. Benfica equalized with a goal from Miccoli 20 minutes later, ending the game 1–1. Santos blamed bad luck for the draw.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Lundgren {{starred in}} one of the biggest blockbusters {{of the year in the}} sci-fi action picture Universal Soldier {{directed}} by Roland Emmerich. Lundgren (as Sergeant Andrew Scott) and Jean-Claude Van Damme (as Luc Deveraux) play U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War who are sent to secure a village against North Vietnamese forces. However they end up shooting each other dead after Devereaux discovers that Scott has gone insane and has resorted to mutilating the villagers and barbarically cutting off their ears, taking an innocent girl and boy hostage. They are later reanimated in a secret Army project along with a large group of other previously dead soldiers and sent on a mission as GR operatives. At the 1992 Cannes Film Festival, Van Damme and Lundgren were involved in a verbal altercation that almost turned physical when both men pushed each other only to be separated, but it was believed to have only been a publicity stunt. Universal Soldier opened in theatres on 10 July 1992, a moderate success domestically with $36,299,898 in US ticket sales, but a major blockbuster worldwide, making over $65million overseas, which earned the film a total of $102million worldwide, on a $23million budget. Despite being a box office hit however, it was not well-received; mainstream critics dismissed the movie as a [...] clone. Film critic Roger Ebert said, [...] "it must be fairly thankless to play lunks who <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> the entire length of a movie while exchanging monosyllabic idiocies", including it in his book I hated, hated, hated this movie.|$|E

Revolutionary laws are a means, and usually a beginning,not an end. But all in all, the existence and knowledge of the law, even for women who don’t actually 	know what it says, has had great symbolic importance as the seedling of the current indigenous women’s movement in Mexico.” ...|$|E

[...] Graham had earlier said that [...] "there come times when we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> peace."

2500|$|Juliana {{was born}} in 30 April 1909 at Noordeinde Palace in The Hague, the only {{daughter}} of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and Prince Henry, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. [...] She was the first Dutch royal baby since Wilhelmina herself {{was born in}} 1880. [...] Wilhelmina had suffered two miscarriages and one stillbirth, raising the prospect that the House of Orange-Nassau would die with her. [...] In all likelihood, this would have meant that the Dutch throne would have passed to Prince Heinrich XXXII Reuss of Köstritz, who had very close ties to Germany. Juliana's birth thus assured the royal family's survival. Her mother suffered two further miscarriages after her birth, leaving Juliana as the royal couple's only child. According to several sources Juliana was happy to be an only child because that meant she didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> attention.|$|E
2500|$|The Mexica {{story is}} that they came from a place called Aztlán, {{described}} as {{an island in the}} middle of a lake. Their god Huitzilopochtli told them to go and look for a promised land. They first arrived around the territory known as Culiacán by 960CE, but then left and returned to Aztlan. [...] Wandering from Aztlan again around the year [...] "1 Tecpatl" [...] or 1064–65 according to the codices Chimalpahin, Aubin and the Anales de Tlalteloco, they soon arrived at Pátzcuaro. They thought that was the land promised to them by Huitzilopochtli, but the god told them to continue. They went east and arrived at Chapultepec, on the edge of what was then Lake Texcoco. The god told them that their promised land was close but that they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> it. Their first opponent was a chief named Cópil, son of a witch named Malinalxochitl and sister of Huitzilopochtli. The Mexica surrounded Cópil's forces, captured and sacrificed the chief's heart to Huitzilopochtli.|$|E

Mercedes discovers Lynsey's relationship with Riley, which Metcalfe explained comes as a shock to Mercedes who has developed a close friendship with Lynsey so does not react as expected. Hassan said that her character's love rivals, Mercedes and Mitzeee, [...] "won't be looking after Lynsey's best interests, so she's going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> Riley's love. She's {{going to take care of}} number one - and if other people get hurt in the process, then so be it". She added that Lynsey values her friendship with Mercedes and would not want to lose it while Mitzeee is a different kind of threat. Hassan went on to say that the storyline will become [...] "deeper and darker" [...] and is not going to end happily, as even though Lynsey and Riley make a good couple Lynsey has never been lucky with men.|$|E
2500|$|Kellner and {{his wife}} {{arranged}} to have their son, Fred William Kellner, sent to the United States in 1935 out of concern he might otherwise <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> Hitler. [...] Fred William returned to Germany in 1945 {{as a member of}} the U.S. Army. He was unable to cope with the devastation he witnessed, and in 1953 he took his own life. [...] He is buried in the American Legion Tomb in Neuilly, France, on the outskirts of Paris. [...] Fred’s son, Robert Scott Kellner, grew up in a children's home in Connecticut. [...] In 1960, while in the United States Navy and traveling through Germany, Robert Scott Kellner located his grandparents, Friedrich and Pauline Kellner, and learned of the existence of the diary. [...] In 1968 Friedrich Kellner gave his diary to his American grandson to translate and bring to the attention of the public. He believed his observations during World War II could have meaning in the increasing hostilities in the world brought about by the Cold War with Communism, and the proliferation of neo-Nazi cults.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{features}} multiple post-credit scenes. The first {{gives the}} Vulture {{a chance at}} redemption, showing him protect Parker from another villain. Watts said this [...] "was a really interesting thing {{in the development of}} the story. You couldn’t just rely on the tropes of the villain being a murderer and killing a bunch of people. He had to be redeemable in some capacity in the end and that he believes everything he said, especially about his family." [...] The second post-credits scene is an additional Captain America PSA, where he talks about the value of patience—a joke at the expense of the audience, who have just waited through the film's credits to see the scene. This was a [...] "last-minute addition" [...] to the film. Watts completed work on Homecoming at the beginning of June 2017, approving the final visual effects shots. He stated that he had never been told that he could not do something by Marvel or Sony, saying, [...] "You assume you’ll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> every little weird thing you wanna do, but I didn’t really ever run into that. I got to do kind of everything I wanted to." [...] That month, Starr explained that he was playing the academic decathlon coach at Parker's high school, and Marshall-Green was said to be portraying another Shocker.|$|E
