The reaction takes place only within coarse-grained sillimanite that has replaced andalusite porphy-roblasts during prograde metamorphism. The product is a gahnite-poor hercynitic spinel, which occurs as very small grains closely associated in space with resorbed staurolite.

The textural {{evidence for a}} genet-ic relationship between <b>hercynite</b> and staurolite is con-firmed by the identical Fe/Mg/Zn ratios of the two min-erals, which causes the collinearity of <b>hercynite,</b> staurolite and A 12 SiO 5 in FeO-MgO-ZnO-AlzO 3 -SiOz-H 20 compo-sition space (FMZASH), and indicates <b>hercynite</b> formed by the reaction: Fe-staurolite = 3. 85 <b>hercynite</b> + 5. 1 sillimanite + 2. 55 quartz + 2 H 20 Staurolite inclusions within andalusite did not break down to form <b>hercynite,</b> indicating a kinetic control, as well as little overstepping of the equilibrium conditions, of the reaction forming <b>hercynite.</b> Assuming overstep-ping did not occur, modelling of the reaction with exist-ing thermodynamic data in the simplified FASH system suggests that the terminal breakdown of staurolite to form <b>hercynite</b> occurred at 2. 5 - 3. 75 kbar nd 585 - 655...|$|E

40|$|Light driven {{metal oxide}} {{catalysts}} {{can be used}} to avert looming energy and environmental challenges by generating hydrogen from water and degrading aqueous organic pollutants. This work reports on investigations of metal oxide catalyzed solar thermal water splitting (STWS) and photocatalytic organic pollutant degradation. Two-step STWS is a process where solar heat is used to drive the endothermic water splitting process; a metal oxide serves as an O-carrier, where in the first step of the STWS process O 2 is released by the metal oxide at high temperatures and in the second step, the O atoms from H 2 O molecules are re-incorporated into the metal oxide releasing H 2. The <b>hercynite</b> cycle is a promising STWS material because of its relatively low reduction temperature, high melting point and H 2 production capacity (over 150 μmol of H 2 /g per cycle). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with high-temperature XRD and EDS analyses show that the <b>hercynite</b> cycle operates via an O-vacancy mechanism, were the O 2 that is released comes from the formation of O vacancies in the doped <b>hercynite</b> according to the reaction: CoxFe 1 Al 2 O 4 → CoxFe 1 -xAl 2 O 4 -δ + δ/ 2 O 2. The <b>hercynite</b> cycle was investigated for use in isothermal solar thermal water splitting where the reduction and oxidation step occur at the same temperature. Isothermal operation was previously thought to not be thermodynamically allowed. Not only does <b>hercynite</b> split water under isothermal conditions, but the H 2 production yields at 1350 °C reduction are, respectively, 3 ̆e 3 and 3 ̆e 12 times that of <b>hercynite</b> and ceria on per mass of active material basis when reduced at 1350 °C and re-oxidized at 1000 °C. A new set of thermodynamic models were developed which more accurately predict STWS behavior, including isothermal modes of operation. The kinetics of the oxidation step of isothermal <b>hercynite</b> solar thermal CO 2 splitting were investigated. Due to complicating reactor and materials behavior, namely CO 2 thermolysis on the reactor walls and hence the simultaneous oxidation of <b>hercynite</b> by CO 2 and O 2, an extended formulation of solid state kinetic theory was developed which enabled the modeling of multiple simultaneous gas solid reactions. A second-order surface reaction model in relation to extent of unreacted material, and a 2. 4 th order model in relation to CO 2 concentration, were found to best describe the CO generation behavior of the doped <b>hercynite.</b> TiO 2 {{can be used as a}} photocatalyst for the degradation of organic pollutants. The reaction is relatively slow due to the inability of O 2, the electron acceptor, to adsorb to the TiO 2 surface. Pt catalysts and material dopants are added to increase the overall rate of reaction. As the content of Pt increase the reaction rates increase and then subsequently decrease. DFT calculations were used to probe the O 2 reduction reaction on the TiO 2 and Pt decorated TiO 2 surface. Pt enables O 2 adsorption and reduction by providing high energy electron density which can form an O 2 -Pt bond, increasing the photocatalytic rate of TiO 2. However, Pt also bridges the TiO 2 band gap which increases electron/hole recombination, decreasing the photocatalytic rate of TiO 2. At low Pt loadings the increased O 2 reduction rate is more significant than the electron-hole recombination but at high Pt loadings the increased electron hole recombination is more significant. Additionally, DFT calculations predict that non-metal near surface TiO 2 dopants can serve as a source of high energy electron density to enable O 2 adsorption and reduction as long as the energy of the band gap states produced by doping are higher in energy that the empty O 2 π* state of the adsorbing O 2. B and interstitial C atoms facilitate O 2 reduction and adsorption but substitutional C and both interstitial and substitutional N dopants do not.

HKO are most widespread in the chondrite matrix but also occur in the porphyritic pyroxene-olivine and olivine chondrules, in which HKO were detected in form of droplets. The latter stick together to produce dumbbell-shaped aggregates. Intrachondrule HKO are zoned and have magmatic textures. Their textural relationships and specific mineralogical features are indicative of the magmatic genesis of intrachondrule HKO and provide information on {{the composition of the}} parental melt. The textural identity between intrachondrule and matrix HKO and similarities in their mineral assemblages and mineral chemistries suggest their similar genesis...|$|E
