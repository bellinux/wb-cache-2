5|$|The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade {{varied in}} size and {{structure}} each time it was created. Headquarters and Service Company, the company comprising the <b>headquarters</b> <b>staff</b> and support personnel, was {{much smaller than the}} equivalent company in standard Marine brigades. Each iteration of the brigade was assigned provisional military police, signal and other supporting companies and platoons. This was not an uncommon practice for the U.S. Marine Corps, which created such ad hoc units regularly in wartime. During World War II two other provisional Marine brigades were formed, which eventually expanded into divisions.|$|E

5000|$|The interservice {{controversy}} over which unified command should control the RDJTF created {{friction between the}} REDCOM and RDJTF <b>headquarters</b> <b>staffs</b> and eventually spilled into the press, which cast the debate as a personal feud between Warner and Kelley.

5|$|After Dieppe the <b>headquarters</b> <b>staff</b> changed again. Lovat was {{promoted}} to brigadier and given command of the 1st Special Service Brigade. Mills-Roberts {{was promoted}} and sent to North Africa to take over command of No. 6 Commando. They were replaced by Robert Dawson as the CO and Ronald Menday as 2IC. Other changes included moving to a new base in Falmouth {{and the formation of}} a heavy weapons troop in each commando. The new troop with mortar and Vickers machine gun sections provided the heavy weapons needed for their new role as assault infantry. By now the Commandos had started to move away from smaller raiding operations. They were formed into units intended to spearhead future Allied landing operations. To assist in this they were given the organic fire support weapons, that had been absent when they were a raiding force.|$|E
5|$|Although Tito's headquarters, {{along with}} several other Partisan organisations, was {{temporarily}} disrupted and key staff were lost during the operation, all Partisan organisations were quickly re-located and resumed operation. Drvar reverted to Partisan control {{within a few weeks}} of the operation. The operation was a failure, as Tito, his principal <b>headquarters</b> <b>staff</b> and the allied military personnel escaped, despite their presence in Drvar {{at the time of the}} airborne assault. The operation failed due to a number of factors, including Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar. The failure of the various German intelligence agencies to share the limited intelligence available on Tito's exact location also contributed to the unsuccessful outcome for the Germans, and this failure to share intelligence was compounded by a lack of contingency planning by the commander of the German airborne force.|$|E
5|$|Degraded by revolt and fifth-column activity, the 27th Infantry Division Savska {{numbered}} about 2,000 effectives {{when the}} German attack began. The 14th Panzer Division vanguard reached their {{positions in the}} Bilogora range around 08:00, and {{the remnants of the}} division began withdrawing towards Križevci under heavy air attack.

The divisional <b>headquarters</b> <b>staff</b> escaped, but were captured a little further down the road at Bojnikovec. The remnants of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment had to fight its way towards Bjelovar, but was attacked by German tanks on the outskirts, captured and detained.

When fifth column supporters of the Croatian nationalist Ustaše movement arrested the <b>headquarters</b> <b>staff</b> of the 7th Army later that day, the formation effectively ceased to exist. On 12 April, the 14th Panzer Division linked up with the Italians near the Adriatic coast, encircling {{the remnants of the}} 7th Army, which offered no further resistance.
