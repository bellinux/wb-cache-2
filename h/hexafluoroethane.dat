50|$|The {{development}} of the fluorocarbon industry coincided with World War II. Prior to that, fluorocarbons were prepared by reaction of fluorine with the hydrocarbon, i.e., direct fluorination. Because C-C bonds are readily cleaved by fluorine, direct fluorination mainly affords smaller perfluorocarbons, such as tetrafluoromethane, <b>hexafluoroethane,</b> and octafluoropropane.|$|E
50|$|As {{the high}} {{electronegativity}} of fluorine reduces the polarizability of the atom, fluorocarbons are only weakly {{susceptible to the}} fleeting dipoles that {{form the basis of}} the London dispersion force. As a result, fluorocarbons have low intermolecular attractive forces and are lipophobic in addition to being hydrophobic and non-polar. Reflecting the weak intermolecular forces these compounds exhibit low viscosities when compared to liquids of similar boiling points, low surface tension and low heats of vaporization. The low attractive forces in fluorocarbon liquids make them compressible (low bulk modulus) and able to dissolve gas relatively well. Smaller fluorocarbons are extremely volatile. There are five perfluoroalkane gases; tetrafluoromethane (bp −128 °C), <b>hexafluoroethane</b> (bp −78.2 °C), octafluoropropane (bp −36.5 °C), perfluoro-n-butane (bp −2.2 °C) and perfluoro-iso-butane (bp −1 °C). Nearly all other fluoroalkanes are liquids; the most notable exception is perfluorocyclohexane, which sublimes at 51 °C. Fluorocarbons also have low surface energies and high dielectric strengths.|$|E
50|$|Anode {{effect is}} a {{situation}} where too many gas bubbles form {{to the bottom of the}} anode and join together forming a layer. This increases the resistance of the cell when smaller areas of the electrolyte touch the anode. These areas of the electrolyte and anode heat up when the density of the electric current of the cell focuses to go through only them. This heats up the gas layer and causes it to expand thus further reducing the surface area where electrolyte and anode are in contact with each other. Anode effect decreases the energy-efficiency and the aluminium production of the cell. It also induces the formation of tetrafluoromethane (CF4) in significant quantities, increased formation of CO and to lesser extent also causes the formation of <b>hexafluoroethane</b> (C2F6). CF4 and C2F6 are CFCs which, although not detrimental to the ozone layer, are still potent greenhouse gases. Anode effect is mainly a problem in Söderberg technology cells, not in prebake.|$|E

40|$|Minimal scan {{times in}} rapid fluorine- 19 MRI using sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) {{have been on}} the order of 10 s.

40|$|It was {{recently}} postulated {{that the effects}} of general anesthetics on protein global dynamics might underlie a unitary molecular mechanism of general anesthesia. To verify that the specific dynamics effects caused by general anesthetics were not shared by nonanesthetic molecules, two parallel 8 -ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed on a gramicidin A (gA) channel in a fully hydrated dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine membrane in the presence and absence of <b>hexafluoroethane</b> (HFE), which structurally resembles the potent anesthetic molecule halothane but produces no anesthesia. Similar to halothane, HFE had no measurable effects on the gA channel structure. In contrast to halothane, HFE produced no significant changes in the gA channel dynamics. The difference between halothane and HFE on channel dynamics can be attributed to their distinctly different distributions within the lipid bilayer and consequently to the different interactions of the anesthetic and the nonanesthetic molecules with the channel-anchoring tryptophan residues.

In this study, in situ measurements of the two PFCs in the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment network are used to show that their emission ratio varies according to the relative regional presence of these two industries, providing an industry-specific emission “signature” to apportion the observed emissions. Our results suggest that underestimated emissions from the global semiconductor industry during 1990 – 2010, {{as well as from}} China's aluminum industry after 2002, account for the observed differences between emissions based on atmospheric measurements and on inventories.

40|$|AbstractThe {{structural}} perturbations of {{the fully}} hydrated dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine bilayer {{induced by the}} presence of <b>hexafluoroethane</b> C 2 F 6, a “nonimmobilizer,” have been examined by molecular dynamics simulations and compared with the effects produced by halothane CF 3 CHBrCl, an “anesthetic,” on a similar bilayer (DPPC) (Koubi et al., Biophys. J. 2000. 78 : 800). We find that the overall structure of the lipid bilayer and the zwitterionic head-group dipole orientation undergo only a slight modification compared with the pure lipid bilayer, with virtually no change in the potential across the interface. This is in contrast to the anesthetic case in which the presence of the molecule led to a large perturbation of the electrostatic potential across to the membrane interface. Similarly, the analysis of the structural and dynamical properties of the lipid core are unchanged {{in the presence of the}} nonimmobilizer although there is a substantial increase in the microscopic viscosity for the system containing the anesthetic. These contrasting perturbations of the lipid membrane caused by those quite similarly sized molecules may explain the difference in their physiological effects as anesthetics and nonimmobilizers, respectively...|$|E
40|$|We use {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{to investigate the}} effects of halothane, a volatile anesthetic, and <b>hexafluoroethane</b> (HFE), its nonimmobilizer analogue, on the physical properties of a fully hydrated polyunsaturated (1 -stearoyl- 2 -docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine) lipid bilayer in the liquid crystalline fluid lamellar phase, LR. In addition, we discuss the results obtained comparing them to previous studies on saturated lipid bilayers with the same solutes. At the analyzed concentration (25 % mole fraction), the halothane molecules are located preferentially near {{the upper part of}} the lipid acyl chains, while the HFE molecules prefer the hydrocarbon chains and methyl trough region. In the case of halothane in the polyunsaturated lipid bilayer, there is an additional density maximum at the membrane center not observed in saturated lipids. The subtle effect of the solutes on the structural properties of the highly unsaturated lipid bilayer and the properties of the membrane interior is somewhat different from that observed for saturated lipids. Here, these differences are interpreted in terms of the unique properties of the polyunsaturated lipid bilayers. The effect of anesthetic molecules on the electrostatic properties of the membrane interface is similar for saturated and polyunsaturated lipid bilayers and is characterized by a change in the most probable orientation of the lipid headgroup dipoles, which point toward the membrane interior for halothane and are basicall...|$|E

The effects of feed gases used, discharge pressure, rf power, substrate positions and discharge modes (pulsed or cw) on the deposited films are examined. Film properties are determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and static contact angle measurements. The contact angles of FC films are well {{related to their}} compositions and structures. Feed gases used, discharge pressure, rf power, substrate positions and discharge modes strongly affect the morphology of the resulting film, as revealed by atomic force microscopy. Optical emission spectrometry measurements were performed to in-situ characterize the gas-phase compositions of the plasmas and radicals' emission intensities during film deposition. Correlations between film properties, gas-phase plasma diagnostic data, and film growth processes were discussed. The film growth in pulsed or downstream plasmas was controlled by the surface migration of radicals, such as CF 2 towards nucleation centers, which result in the deposition of FC films with less cross-linked nature and rougher surfaces. These results demonstrate {{that it is possible}} to control film compositions and surface structure by changing deposition parameters. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This experiment measured the three-phase (hydrate, liquid water, and vapor [H-LW-V]) equilibria of ternary C 2 F 6 (10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 %) +N 2 +H 2 O systems and indicated the possible existence of hydrate azeotropes at certain temperature ranges.

In terms of CO[subscript 2] equivalents, current NF[subscript 3] emissions represent between 17 % and 36 % of the emissions of other long-lived fluorinated compounds from electronics manufacture.
