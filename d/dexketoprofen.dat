50|$|<b>Dexketoprofen</b> {{belongs to}} a class of {{medicines}} called NSAIDs. It works by blocking the action of a substance in the body called cyclo-oxygenase. Cyclo-oxygenase {{is involved in the}} production of chemicals in the body called prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are produced in response to injury or certain diseases and would otherwise go on to cause swelling, inflammation and pain. By blocking cyclo-oxygenase, <b>dexketoprofen</b> prevents the production of prostaglandins and therefore reduces inflammation and pain. Along with Peripheral analgesic action it possesses central analgesic action.|$|E
50|$|In some countries, the {{optically}} pure (S)-enantiomer (<b>dexketoprofen)</b> is available; its {{trometamol salt}} {{is said to}} be particularly rapidly reabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, having a rapid onset of effects.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dexketoprofen</b> is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID). It is {{manufactured by}} Menarini, under the tradename Keral. It {{is available in}} the UK, as <b>dexketoprofen</b> trometamol, as a prescription-only drug and in Latin America as Enantyum, produced by Menarini. Also, in Italy and Spain it is available as an over-the-counter drug (OTC) under the tradenames Enantyum, and Ketesgel, respectively. In Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia it is available as an over-the-counter drug (OTC) under tradename Dolmen. In Mexico it is available in tablet form as [...] "Stadium" [...] made by Menarini. It is the dextrorotatory stereoisomer of ketoprofen.|$|E
50|$|Ibuprofen and {{ketoprofen}} are {{now available}} in single, active enantiomer preparations (dexibuprofen and <b>dexketoprofen),</b> which purport to offer quicker onset and an improved side-effect profile. Naproxen has always been marketed as the single active enantiomer.|$|E
50|$|It {{may cause}} {{dizziness}} and therefore, patients should not drive or operate heavy machinery or vehicles {{until they are}} familiar with how <b>dexketoprofen</b> affects them.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Dexketoprofen,</b> an NSAID {{used in the}} {{management}} of acute and chronic pains, is licensed in several countries but has not previously been the subjected of a systematic review. We used published and unpublished information from randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of <b>dexketoprofen</b> in painful conditions to assess evidence on efficacy and harm. Methods PubMed and Cochrane Central were searched for RCTs of <b>dexketoprofen</b> for pain of any aetiology. Reference lists of retrieved articles and reviews were also searched. Menarini Group produced copies of published and unpublished studies (clinical trial reports). Data were abstracted into a standard form. For studies reporting results of single dose administration, the number of patients with at least 50 % pain relief was derived and used to calculate the relative benefit (RB) and number-needed-to-treat (NNT) for one patient to achieve at least 50 % pain relief compared with placebo.

Almost all of the trials were of short duration in acute conditions or recent onset pain. All 12 randomised trials that compared <b>dexketoprofen</b> (any dose) with placebo found <b>dexketoprofen</b> to be statistically superior. Five trials in postoperative pain yielded NNTs for 12. 5 mg <b>dexketoprofen</b> of 3. 5 (2. 7 to 4. 9), 25 mg <b>dexketoprofen</b> of 3. 0 (2. 4 to 3. 9), and 50 mg <b>dexketoprofen</b> of 2. 1 (1. 5 to 3. 5).

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the degree of interaction between <b>dexketoprofen</b> and dexibuprofen, by isobolographic analysis using the formalin orofacial assay in mice. This assay presents two-phase time course: an early short-lasting, phase I, starting immediately after the formalin injection producing a tonic acute pain, leaving a 15 min quiescent period, followed by a prolonged, phase II, after the formalin and representing inflammatory pain. Administration of <b>dexketoprofen</b> or dexibuprofen produced a dose-dependent antinociception, with different potency, either during phases I or II. The co-administration of <b>dexketoprofen</b> and dexibuprofen produced synergism in phase I and II.

40|$|Backround: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} analgesic efficacy, opioid-sparing, and opioid-related {{adverse effects of}} intravenous paracetamol and intravenous <b>dexketoprofen</b> trometamol in combination with iv morphine after total abdominal hysterectomy. Materials and Methods: Sixty American Society of Anesthesiologist Physical Status Classification I-II patients scheduled for total abdominal hysterectomy were enrolled to this double-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled, and prospective study. Patients were divided into three groups as paracetamol, <b>dexketoprofen</b> trometamol, and placebo (0. 9 % NaCl) due to their post-operative analgesic usage. Intravenous patient controlled analgesia morphine {{was used as a}} rescue analgesic in all groups. Pain scores, hemodynamic parameters, morphine consumption, patient satisfaction, and side-effects were evaluated. Results: Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores were not statistically significantly different among the groups in all evaluation times, but decrease in VAS scores was statistically significant after the evaluation at 12 th h in all groups. Total morphine consumption (morphine concentration = 0. 2 mg/ml) in group paracetamol (72. 3 ± 38. 0 ml) and <b>dexketoprofen</b> trometamol (69. 3 ± 24. 1 ml) was significantly lower than group placebo (129. 3 ± 22. 6 ml) (P < 0. 001). Global satisfaction scores of the patients in group placebo was significantly lower than group <b>dexketoprofen</b> trometamol after surgery and the increase in global satisfaction score was significant only in group placebo. Conclusion: <b>Dexketoprofen</b> trometamol and Paracetamol didn′t cause significant change on pain scores, but increased patients′ comfort. Although total morphine consumption was significantly decreased by both drugs, the incidence of nausea and vomiting were similar among the groups. According to {{results of the present study}} routine addition of <b>dexketoprofen</b> trometamol and paracetamol to patient controlled analgesia morphine after hysterectomies is not recommended...|$|E

40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effect of perioperative analgesia with nonselective cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibitor <b>dexketoprofen</b> and opioid drug omnopon on the functional activity of immune cells in tumor excision murine model. Lewis lung carcinoma cells were transplanted into hind paw of C 57 /black mice. On the 23 th day tumor was removed. Analgesic drugs were injected 30 min before and once a day for 3 days after the surgery. Biological material was obtained a day before, 1 day and 3 days after the tumor removal. IFN-γ, IL- 4, IL- 10 and TGF-β mRNA levels in splenic cells were assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Cytotoxic activity of splenocytes was estimated by flow cytometry. We found that in splenocytes of mice received opioid analgesia IL- 10 mRNA level was increased 2. 3 times on day one after the surgery compared to preoperative level (P < 0. 05), while in <b>dexketoprofen</b> group this parameter did not change. IFN-γ gene expression level on day 3 after tumor removal was 40 % higher in splenocytes of <b>dexketoprofen</b> treated mice as compared with omnopon treated animals (P < 0. 05). Cytotoxic activity of splenocytes on day 3 postsurgery was (62. 2 ± 2. 4) % in <b>dexketoprofen</b> against (50. 2 ± 3. 3) % in omnopon group.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ketoprofen is a non-selective non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) used {{to treat}} acute and chronic painful conditions. <b>Dexketoprofen</b> is the (S) -enantiomer, which is believed to confer analgesia. Theoretically <b>dexketoprofen</b> is expected to provide equivalent analgesia to ketoprofen at half the dose, with a consequent reduction in gastrointestinal adverse events. OBJECTIVES: To assess efficacy, duration of action, and associated adverse events of single dose oral ketoprofen and <b>dexketoprofen</b> in acute postoperative pain in adults. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief Database for studies to August 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trials of single dose orally administered ketoprofen and <b>dexketoprofen</b> in adults with moderate to severe acute postoperative pain. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Pain relief or pain intensity data were extracted and converted into the dichotomous outcome of number of participants with at least 50 % pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, from which relative risk and number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT) were calculated. Numbers of participants using rescue medication over specified time periods, and time to use of rescue medication, were sought as additional measures of efficacy. Information on adverse events and withdrawals was collected. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen studies compared ketoprofen (968 participants) at mainly 25 mg and 50 mg with placebo (520 participants). Seven studies compared <b>dexketoprofen</b> (681 participants) at mainly 10 mg to 25 mg with placebo (289 participants). Studies were of adequate reporting quality, and participants had pain following dental, orthopaedic, obstetric, gynaecological and general surgery. There was considerable clinical heterogeneity between studies in dental {{and other types of}} surgery, particularly bunionectomy, which limited analysis. Ketoprofen at doses between 12. 5 mg and 100 mg produced NNTs for at least 50 % pain relief over 4 to 6 hours of 2. 4 to 3. 3. For dental studies only there was a trend to more efficacy at higher doses, with NNT decreasing from 2. 4 at 12. 5 mg to 1. 6 at 100 mg. <b>Dexketoprofen</b> at doses of 10 / 12. 5 mg and 20 / 25 mg produced NNTs for at least 50 % pain relief over 4 to 6 hours of 3. 2 and 3. 6, with no obvious dose response. Significantly fewer participants used rescue medication with ketoprofen and <b>dexketoprofen</b> than placebo. The median time to remedication was about 5 hours with ketoprofen and 4 hours with <b>dexketoprofen.</b> The expected equivalent efficacy with a half dose of <b>dexketoprofen</b> compared to ketoprofen was not demonstrated. Adverse events were uncommon with both drugs, and not significantly different from placebo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Ketoprofen at doses of 25 mg to 100 mg is an effective analgesic in moderate to severe acute postoperative pain with an NNT for at least 50 % pain relief of 3. 3 with a 50 mg dose. This {{is similar to that of}} commonly used NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (NNT 2. 5 for 400 mg dose) and diclofenac (NNT 2. 7 at 50 mg dose). Duration of action is about 5 hours. <b>Dexketoprofen</b> is also effective with NNTs of 3. 2 to 3. 6 in the dose range 10 mg to 25 mg. Both drugs were well tolerated in single doses...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to develop and {{validate}} a high performace liquid chromatography method for determination of thiocolchicoside and <b>dexketoprofen</b> trometamol in combined dosage form. The proposed HPLC method utilizes an Agilent Eclipse C- 8 column (5 µm, 250 × 4. 6 mm) at ambient temperature. A 23 full factorial design was performed for optimization of mobile phase for separation of two drugs. For the factorial design, the dependent variables chosen were % of acetonitrile, % of 0. 1 % o-phosphoric acid and pH. The optimum mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile: 0. 1 % o-phosphoric acid in water (41. 9 : 58. 1; pH 2. 6). The flow rate was kept 1 mL/min with UV detection at 254 nm. The run time {{was found to be}} 1. 41 min and 7. 58 min for thiocolchicoside and <b>dexketoprofen</b> trometamol, respectively. The method was validated as per ICH guidelines. The calibration plots were linear in the range of 1 - 5 μg/mL with r 2 = 0. 998 for thiocolchicoside and 6 - 30 μg/mL with r 2 = 0. 995 for <b>dexketoprofen</b> trometamol.

40|$|The {{combination}} of classic non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with opiates induces more analgesia than the summed effect of each drug given separately.

The responses were evoked by noxious mechanical stimulation and were recorded as single motor units in male Wistar rats anaesthetized with α-chloralose. The effective dose 50 (ED 50) observed with fentanyl was 22. 4 ± 1. 5 [*]μg[*]kg− 1 and full recovery was apparent 20 [*]min later.

NS- 398 (6 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) decreased the micturition frequency and increased the pressure threshold when administered 3 [*]h but not 15 [*]min following surgery. Administration of LPS (2 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v., 90 – 120 [*]min) increased both the micturition frequency and the pressure threshold for triggering the micturition reflex. Changes in urodynamic parameters induced by LPS were prevented by doses of either <b>dexketoprofen</b> (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) or NS- 398 (2 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) which were ineffective in control animals. Pretreatment with CYP (150 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p., 48 [*]h) increased the micturition frequency, pressure threshold, and the minimal intravesical pressure but decreased the mean amplitude of micturition contractions. In CYP-treated rats, <b>dexketoprofen</b> (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) or NS- 398 (2 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) blocked the CYP-induced urodynamic changes with exception of the micturition contraction amplitude. These results indicate that COX- 1 may be involved in modulating the threshold for activating the micturition reflex in the normal rats and also demonstrates that inhibition of COX- 2 prevents or reverses the urodynamic changes associated with bladder inflammation induced either by surgery, LPS or CYP treatments...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground and objectiveIn this study, our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of intravenous <b>dexketoprofen</b> trometamol with ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block on analgesic quality and morphine consumption after total abdominal hysterectomy operations. MethodsWe conducted this randomized controlled clinical study on 61 patients. The study was conducted in the operation room, post-anesthesia care unit, and inpatient clinic. We randomly grouped the 61 patients into control group (group C), block group (group B) and dexketoprofen-block group (group DB). Before the skin incision performed after anesthesia induction, we performed ilioinguinal iliohypogastric block (group C given saline and group P and DB given levobupivacaine). In contrast to group C and B, group DB was given <b>dexketoprofen.</b> We administered morphine analgesia to all patients by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) during the postoperative 24 hours. We recorded Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), satisfaction scores, morphine consumption and side effects during postoperative 24 hours. ResultsWe found the DB group's VAS scores to be lower than the control group and block group's (p < 0. 05) values at postoperative 1 st, 2 nd, 6 th and 12 th hours. VAS scores of group C were higher than of group B at postoperative ﬁrst 2 hours. Time to ﬁrst PCA demand was longer, morphine consumption values were lower and satisfaction scores were higher in group DB than in the other two groups (p < 0. 05). ConclusionsIlioinguinal-iliohypogastric nerve block with IV <b>dexketoprofen</b> increases patient satisfaction by decreasing opioid consumption, increasing patient satisfaction, which suggests that <b>dexketoprofen</b> trometamol is an effective non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory analgesic in postoperative analgesia...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} has been to assess the {{comparative}} use of the two NSAIDs, <b>dexketoprofen</b> and ketoprofen, for postoperative analgesia after laparoscopic cholecystectomy mainly following: {{the quality of the}} analgesia, the incidence of potential adverse effects (for example, postoperative nausea and vomiting) and the rescue analgesics consumption (tramadol). This prospective, randomized, double-blind study included 90 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anaesthesia. Patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups: group D (n = 45) - patients that have received <b>dexketoprofen</b> 50 mg in dilution with 10 ml saline solution iv., 30 minutes before the induction and group K (n = 45) - patients that have received ketoprofen 100 mg in dilution with 10 ml saline solution iv., 30 minutes before the induction (preemptive analgesia). Surgical interventions were conducted under general anaesthesia, with identical protocol for the two groups of study. Post-surgery analgesic regime consisting in 4 g of paracetamol administered for example in the first 24 hours, was started immediately after surgery. Boluses of tramadol of 100 mg (until 400 mg /daily) have been used as rescue analgesia. The main objectives {{of our study}} have been: post-surgery analgesia (VAS at mobilization, 0 - 100 mm) at 0, 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours after the surgery,the consumption of tramadol, incidence of PONV and the length of hospitalization period (LOS). Secondary objectives of the study have been: the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the incidence of postsurgery blood losses. In the two study groups there have not been any differences concerning demographic data, post-surgery gastro-intestinal symptoms, postsurgery loss of blood and the hospitalization period. VAS was significantly lower in group D vs. K, at 0 and 6 hours after the surgery (p < 0, 05). The incidence of PONV was lower in the group of patients who received preemptive analgesia with <b>dexketoprofen</b> (p < 0, 05). The number of tramadol boluses administered and the number of patients requiring backup analgesia was lower in group D comparatively to group K. Preemptive administration of <b>dexketoprofen</b> seems to be more effective than the administration of ketoprofen for post-surgery multimodal analgesia after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The preemptive administration of <b>dexketoprofen</b> also deereases tramadol consumption and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting...|$|E
40|$|Objective. Comparison of <b>dexketoprofen</b> and {{paracetamol}} {{added to}} the lidocaine in Regional Intravenous Anesthesia in terms of hemodynamic effects, motor and sensorial block onset times, intraoperative VAS values, and analgesia requirements. Method. The files of 73 patients between 18 and 65 years old in the ASA I-II risk group who underwent hand and forearm surgery were analyzed and 60 patients {{were included in the}} study. Patients were divided into 3 groups: Group D (n= 20), 3 [*]mg/kg 2 % lidocaine and 50 [*]mg/ 2 [*]mL <b>dexketoprofen</b> trometamol; Group P (n= 20), 3 [*]mg/kg 2 % lidocaine and 3 [*]mg/kg paracetamol; Group K (n= 20), 3 [*]mg/kg 2 % lidocaine. Demographic data, motor and sensorial block times, heart rate, mean blood pressure, VAS values, and intraoperative and postoperative analgesia requirements were recorded. Results. Sensorial and motor block onset durations of Group K were significantly longer than other groups. Motor block termination duration was found to be significantly longer in Group D than in Group K. VAS values of Group K were found higher than other groups. There {{was no significant difference in}} VAS values between Group D and Group P. Analgesia requirement was found to be significantly more in Group K than in Group P. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of heart rates and mean arterial pressures. Conclusion. We concluded that the addition of 3 [*]mg/kg paracetamol and 50 [*]mg <b>dexketoprofen</b> to lidocaine as adjuvant in Regional Intravenous Anesthesia applied for hand and/or forearm surgery created a significant difference clinically...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pain is {{a common}} {{complaint}} and a terrible experience for post operative patient, so that it requires an optimal management, {{and one of them}} is by using analgesics from NSAIDs group. One aspect in assessing efficacy is by measuring the degree of pain that the patient felt which can be measured with VAS pain score. This study aims to analyze the difference of the visual analogue scale score between ketorolac and deksketoprofen. Methods: A retrospective observational clinical test using secondary data from a research by participants of PPDS Anesthesiology by adopting the data on VAS score. The secondary data then divided randomly into 2 groups, where each group composed of 18, group I received ketorolac 30 mg iv before surgery and repeated every 8 hours during 48 hours post-surgery, while group II received <b>dexketoprofen</b> 50 mg iv before surgery and repeated every 8 hours during 48 hours post-surgery. VAS scores were measured every 8 hours for 48 hours post-surgery. The data was described in tables and graphs and analyzed using computer program. Result: The lowest median value of VAS score was obtained at the 6 th VAS score to each group (1 vs 0, 5). The Friedman test and Wilcoxon test showed significant results for each group (p < 0. 05). Different test on VAS scores between groups also showed significantly different results for all VAS scores (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: There was a significant difference in VAS scores between group that received ketorolac 30 mg iv and group that received <b>dexketoprofen</b> 50 mg iv.

40|$|Aim: We {{investigated}} the fentanyl dose used in patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) of preemptive intravenous (IV) <b>dexketoprofen</b> trometamol (DKP) after abdominal hysterectomy. Material and Method: Following {{approval by the}} local ethics committee, 40 patients scheduled for ASA I-II abdominal hysterectomy were randomly divided into two groups. The anesthetic techniques were standardized. Group F (n= 20) : Placebo administered 30 minutes prior to operation and after 8 hours; Group D (n= 20) : 50 mg IV <b>dexketoprofen</b> trometamol administered 30 minutes prior to operation and after 8 hours. When VAS> 3, 1. 5 %u 03 BCg/kg fentanyl was administered to both groups in the recovery room. At intervals and afterwards, analgesia was provided through PCA (bolus dose: 25 %u 03 BCg fentanyl; lock out period: 10 min.; 4 -hr limit: 400 %u 03 BCg). VAS score, sedation score, fentanyl consumption, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and side-effects were recorded. Results: Demographic data and duration of surgery {{in the two groups}} were similar. Respiratory depression was not seen in either group. There was no significant difference based on the VAS score (p= 0. 07). Nausea and vomiting were significantly higher in the Group F compared to Group D (p= 0. 03). Compared to Group F, PONV were less in Group D, at 12 hr and 24 hr postoperatively (p= 0. 03). Fentanyl consumption at 12 and 24 hours was lower in Group D than Group F (p= 0. 001). Discussion: In cases where 50 mg of intravenous <b>dexketoprofen</b> trometamol was administered, we observed that the fentanyl consumption decreased by 40 %, analgesia quality increased and the incidence of sideeffects decreased...|$|E
40|$|Gianni Allais, Chiara Benedetto Department of Surgical Sciences, Women’s Headache Center, University of Turin, Turin, Italy Abstract: Migraine is {{a common}} {{neurovascular}} disorder, affecting millions of people worldwide. Current guidelines recommend triptans as first-line treatment for moderate-to-severe migraine attacks. Frovatriptan is a second-generation triptan with a longer terminal elimination half-life in blood than other triptans (~ 26 hours). Three double-blind, randomized crossover preference studies have been recently conducted, assessing efficacy and safety of frovatriptan versus rizatriptan, zolmitriptan, and almotriptan, respectively. Frovatriptan showed favorable tolerability and sustained effect, with a significantly lower rate of relapse over 48 hours versus the other triptans. These findings were confirmed {{in a series of}} analyses of patient subsets from the three studies, including patients with menstrually related and oral contraceptive-induced migraine, hypertension, obesity, weekend migraine, as well as patients with migraine with aura. In all patient subsets analyzed, lower headache recurrence rates were observed versus the comparator triptans, indicating a more sustained pain-relieving effect on migraine symptoms. A further randomized, double-blind study demonstrated that frovatriptan given in combination with the fast-acting cyclooxygenase inhibitor <b>dexketoprofen</b> provided improved migraine pain-free activity at 2 hours, and gave more sustained pain-free activity at 24 hours, versus frovatriptan alone. These benefits were observed both when the combination was administered early ( 1 hour after onset). Different pharmacokinetic, but synergistic, properties between frovatriptan and <b>dexketoprofen</b> may make the combination of these agents particularly effective in migraine treatment, with rapid onset of action and sustained effect over 48 hours. These benefits, together with potential cost-effectiveness advantages versus other triptans could drive selection of the most appropriate treatment for acute migraine attacks.

40|$|Objective: In this study, we aimed {{comparing}} early postoperative period analgesic {{effectiveness and}} the effects on opioid consumption of intravenous <b>dexketoprofen</b> and lornoxicam that are given preemptively. Materials and Methods: Forty patients, planned elective mediastinoscopy, were included in this prospective randomized study. These patients were classified in two groups, group D for dexketoprofene trometamol and group L for lornoxicam, randomly. 20 minutes before the operation 50 mg dexketoprofene trometamol and 8 mg lornoxicam were injected intravenously for group D and group L respectively. In postoperative intensive care unit, pain scores, mean arterial pressures, heart rates and peripheric O 2 saturations of patients were recorded at 0, 10, 20, 60, 90 and 120 th minutes. Results: When we evaluate the VAS score of the groups, {{there was a significant}} decrease in group D in all measured timesstatistically compairing to group L (p 0. 05). Conclusion: Since intravenous <b>dexketoprofen,</b> applied preemptively, has more potent analgesic effect and causing less opioid consumption in early postoperative period, is better than intravenous lornoxicam...|$|E
40|$|The present {{manuscript}} describes simple, sensitive, rapid, accurate, {{precise and}} economic dual wavelength spectrophotometric method for simultaneous determination of Thiocolchicoside and <b>Dexketoprofen</b> trometemol in combined tablet dosage form. The utility of dual wavelength data processing program {{is its ability}} to calculate unknown concentration of components of interest in a mixture containing an interfering component. The method was based on property of additivity of absorbances. The two wavelengths on UV spectrum of Thiocolchicoside were found out where it showed same absorbance, which were 368 nm and 284. 60 nm. At 368 nm Thiocolchicoside showed some absorbance whereas <b>Dexketoprofen</b> trometemol showed zero absorbance. Both the drugs gave absorbance at 284. 60 nm. The method involved solving of an equation based on measurement of absorbances at two wavelengths 284. 6 and 368 nm. The two drugs follow Beer-Lambert’s law over the concentration range of 2 - 24 µg/ml. The method was successfully applied to pharmaceutical dosage form because no interference from the tablet excipients was found.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In this double-blind, randomized, {{placebo-controlled}} trial, {{the safety}} and analgesic efficacy of perioperative <b>dexketoprofen</b> were evaluated. METHODS: Thirty ASA I or II patients undergoing elective hip arthroplasty were randomized {{to one of two}} groups. One group (D) received <b>dexketoprofen</b> 25 mg tds for 24 h before and 48 h after surgery; the second group (P) received placebo tablets at equivalent times. Hyperbaric 0. 5 % bupivacaine (17. 5 mg if greater than 70 kg and 15 mg if less than 70 kg) and preservative-free morphine (0. 6 mg) were administered intrathecally. Postoperatively, PCA was provided (bolus morphine sulphate 1 mg; lockout 5 min; no continuous infusion). RESULTS: The two groups were similar in terms of age, gender, weight, height, ASA class, duration of operation, and level of sensory block on arrival to the recovery room. Groups were also similar in terms of blood loss, transfusion requirements, ventilatory frequency, and haemodynamic variables. According to visual analogue pain scores patients in group D experienced less pain at 15 h (P= 0. 02) postoperatively. Cumulative morphine consumption was also less in group D compared with group P at 6 (0. 06 (0. 2) vs 0. 85 (1. 4) mg, P= 0. 04) and 48 h postoperatively (10. 1 (8) vs 26. 2 (20) mg, P< 0. 01). Plasma interleukin 6 concentrations increased postoperatively to a significantly lesser extent in group D than in group P (P= 0. 02). Nausea and vomiting were less (P< 0. 01) in group D compared with group P at 18 h postoperatively. Sedation scores were less (P= 0. 03) in group D. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative administration of <b>dexketoprofen</b> 25 mg 8 hourly markedly improves analgesia and decreases opioid requirements (and associated adverse effects) following hip arthroplasty. It appears that this regimen decreases the postoperative pro-inflammatory response...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: Wound {{infiltration}} using local anesthetics, anti-inflammatory {{drugs and}} opioids can significantly improve postoperative analgesia. The {{purpose of this}} clinical {{study was to determine}} the most effective method of wound infiltration among morphine, tramadol, <b>dexketoprofen</b> and bupivacaine for postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing lumbar discectomy. Methods: One hundred patients undergone elective lumbar discectomy operations were included. Patients were randomly allocated to one of five groups: wound infiltration with 10 mg morphine (group M), with 100 mg tramadol (group T), with 50 mg <b>dexketoprofen</b> (group D), with 100 mg bupivacaine (group B) or control group (group C). Pain scores using visual analog scale (VAS) at 15 th min, 1 st, 6 th, 12 th, and 24 th hours postoperatively and 24 -h analgesic requirements were recorded. Results: No differences were determined between the four groups by means of demographic and clinical characteristics. In terms of patient satisfaction, Group M was significantly superior to groups D and B, respectively (p< 0. 05 for all). Post-hoc analyses revealed that the 15 -min VAS score was significantly lower in Group M than in Group D; the 1 -h VAS score was significantly lower than in groups T and A; the 6 -h VAS score was significantly lower than in groups T, A and B, and the 24 -h VAS score was significantly lower than in groups D and B, respectively (p< 0. 05). Tramadol consumption in the postoperative period was significantly lower in Group M than in Group B (p= 0. 004).
