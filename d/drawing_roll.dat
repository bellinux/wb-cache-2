Numer. Meth. Fluids, 78, 436 – 454. doi: 10. 1002 /fld. 4024, which has been published in final form at [URL] audienceThe polymer cast film process consists of stretching a molten polymer film between a flat die and a <b>drawing</b> <b>roll.</b> Drawing instabilities are often encountered and represent a drastic limitation to the process. Newtonian fluid film stretching stability is investigated using two numerical strategies. The first one is a ‘tracking’ method, which consists of solving Stokes equations in the whole fluid area (extrusion die and stretching path) by finite elements. The interface is determined to satisfy a kinematic equation. A domain decomposition meshing technique is used in order to account for a flow singularity resulting from {{the change in the}} boundary conditions between the die flow region and the stretching path region. A linear stability method is then applied to this transient kinematic equation in order to investigate the stability of the stationary solution. The second method is a direct finite element simulation in an extended area including the fluid and the surrounding air. The time-dependent interface is captured by solving an appropriate level-set function. The agreement between the two methods is fair. The influence of the stretching parameters (Draw ratio and drawing length) is investigated. For a long stretching distance, a critical Draw ratio around 20 delimitating stable and unstable drawing conditions is obtained, and this agrees well with the standard membrane models, which have been developed 40 [*]years ago. When decreasing the stretching distance, the membrane model is no longer valid. The 2 D models presented here point out a significant increase of the critical Draw ratio, and this is consistent with experimental results...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{possibility}} of high speed roll casting of AZ 31, AM 60 and AZ 91 was investigated. Warm deep <b>drawing</b> of <b>roll</b> cast magnesium alloy was operated. and formability of roll cast magnesium strip was cleared. Design/methodology/approach: A vertical type high speed twin roll caster was used. The roll casting was operated {{in the air}} atmosphere. The casting speed was from 60 m/min up to 180 m/min. Low temperature casting was adopted to realize high speed casting. Findings: Strip thinner 3 mm with 100 width could be cast continuously. The casting ability became better with increasing content of Al. Roll cast Mg alloy strips could be hot-rolled down to 0. 5 mm. AZ 31 as-cast strip could be thinner down to 0. 5 mm only by three times of hot rolling. Deep drawing was operated with three kinds of Mg alloy at 250 °C, and LDR value was larger than 2. 0. It was shown that deep drawing of AZ 91 alloy for casting was possible. Research limitations/implications: There was tendency that cracks occurred at the center in the thickness direction as Al content increased. Practical implications: Sheet metal forming of magnesium alloy with high content Al can be realized. Originality/value: It was shown that {{possibility of}} high speed roll casting of magnesium alloy, and warm deep <b>drawing</b> of <b>roll</b> cast AZ 91 strip...|$|R
