Background: New orthodontic products are continuously introduced to clinicians seeking more practical and efficient solutions for their practice. One such product {{is a new}} <b>flash-free</b> adhesive for orthodontic bracket bonding, which has been introduced to the market recently. This new adhesive needs to be clinically appraised with regard to its efficacy and efficiency, and compared with conventional orthodontic adhesives that are currently in use. Aims: To compare {{the quality of the}} bond at the enamel-bracket interface using micro-computed tomography (microCT), the amount of adhesive remaining on the tooth surface after bracket debonding, the time required for adhesive remnant cleanup, and clinical practitioners' preference between the new <b>flash-free</b> and a conventional adhesive. Materials and Methods: A total of 160 bovine incisors were bonded with ceramic orthodontic brackets using the <b>flash-free</b> adhesive (APC <b>Flash-Free</b> Adhesive Coated Appliance System, 3 M) {{on one side and a}} conventional adhesive (APCII Adhesive Coated Appliance System, 3 M) on the other side. Twenty-four teeth were randomly selected and scanned using microCT to analyze microleakage into the adhesive layer. Twenty orthodontists debonded twenty mounted dental arches. The adhesive remnant on the bovine incisors was quantified. The orthodontists then removed the remaining adhesive. The time required for complete removal of adhesive was recorded. Finally, the orthodontists completed a specifically designed survey to evaluate their preference for one of the two adhesives. Results: For both adhesives tested, the microleakage was very minimal with no significant differences between the two adhesives. The amount of adhesive remaining on the tooth after bracket debonding was significantly larger for the <b>flash-free</b> adhesive (P< 0. 0001). The adhesive cleanup was about 8 % faster when using the <b>flash-free</b> adhesive, but the difference was not statistically significant when compared with the conventional adhesive. Fourteen out of 20 orthodontists preferred the <b>flash-free</b> product over the conventional product. Conclusions: With regard to the practicality and efficiency, the new <b>flash-free</b> adhesive performs just as well as the conventional adhesive...|$|E
40|$|Humboldt State University has {{modified}} the award-winning “Begin Research” online tutorial {{developed by the}} University of California, Irvine Library into a <b>flash-free</b> interface on Drupal. The open-source tutorial is now accessible on mobile devices and has additional options for embedded assessment. This presentation will demonstrate how the tutorial has been adapted and used at universities across the country, and how your Library can modify it to use on your campus for interactive and engaging online information literacy instruction. I will also discuss the challenges faced during the adaptation {{and how they were}} resolved through collaboration with partnerships across campus...|$|E
40|$|The <b>flash-free</b> {{high-speed}} video stroboscope for periodic and non-periodic repetitive events {{presented at}} the 22 th ICHSPP has been improved. All components of the system (the camera, frame grabber, digital phase shifter, frequency synthesiser and the universal counter) are now controlled by intergrated software. The flexibility of the system has been increased by adding a number of features which can be selected and adjusted by the user. For easy documentation each of the captured and stored frames is labelled with the most important parameters of the investigated object {{as well as the}} settings of the stroboscope system and the data and time. These parameters are displayed on the screen during the observation of the object and during the recording and play back of the stored pictures and sequences. Unsteady objects, i. e. having a temporal/phase jitter or/and spatial fluctuations can be now investigated using the real-time frame averaging routines newly added to the software. Some system application examples and results are presente...|$|E
