40|$|To {{correlate}} perfusion MR imaging with histologic {{grade of}} cerebral <b>gliomas.</b> Materials & Methods Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps were determined in 22 patients with pathologically proved <b>gliomas</b> (11 glioblastomas, 8 anaplastic <b>gliomas</b> and 2 low-grade <b>gliomas)</b> by dynamic contrast-enhanced T 2 *-weighted MR imaging. MR examination was completed with conventional T 1 - and T 2 -weighted imaging.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{high grade}} <b>gliomas,</b> 1 p 19 q codeletion and EGFR {{amplification}} are mutually exclusive and predictive of dramatically different outcomes. We performed a microarray gene expression study of four high grade <b>gliomas</b> with 1 p 19 q codeletion and nine with EGFR amplification, identified by CGH-array. Results The {{two groups of}} <b>gliomas</b> exhibited very different gene expression profiles and were consistently distinguished by unsupervised clustering analysis. One {{of the most striking}} differences was the expression of normal brain genes by oligodendrogliomas with 1 p 19 q codeletion. These <b>gliomas</b> harbored a gene expression profile that partially resembled the gene expression of normal brain samples, whereas <b>gliomas</b> with EGFR amplification expressed many genes in common with glioblastoma cancer stem cells. The differences between the two types of <b>gliomas</b> and the expression of neuronal genes in <b>gliomas</b> with 1 p 19 q codeletion were both validated in an independent series of 16 <b>gliomas</b> using real-time RT-PCR with a set of 22 genes differentiating the two groups of <b>gliomas</b> (AKR 1 C 3, ATOH 8, BMP 2, C 20 orf 42, CCNB 1, CDK 2, CHI 3 L 1, CTTNBP 2, DCX, EGFR, GALNT 13, GBP 1, IGFBP 2, IQGAP 1, L 1 CAM, NCAM 1, NOG, OLIG 2, PDPN, PLAT, POSTN, RNF 135). Immunohistochemical study of the most differentially expressed neuronal gene, alpha-internexin, clearly differentiated the two groups of <b>gliomas,</b> with 1 p 19 q codeletion <b>gliomas</b> showing specific staining in tumor cells.

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare thallium- 201 single-photon {{emission}} CT {{with conventional}} CT in grading the malignancy of <b>gliomas</b> {{and to determine}} the reliability of each in tumor assessment. METHODS: We studied 37 patients who had <b>gliomas</b> (31 high grade and 6 low grade) and compared the CT findings with the thallium- 201 index, which we defined as tumor uptake relative to the uptake in the contralateral hemisphere. RESULTS: Among the high-grade <b>gliomas,</b> we observed a significant correlation between breakdown volume of the blood-brain barrier and thallium- 201 uptake. However, 8 of the high-grade <b>gliomas</b> had low thallium- 201 uptake, in the same range as the low-grade <b>gliomas.</b> Of these, 2 were nonenhancing and the other 6 showed ring enhancement on CT scans. Analysis of variance showed {{no significant difference in}} thallium- 201 indexes between low-grade <b>gliomas</b> and highly malignant (grade II-III) <b>gliomas.</b> Accuracy of thallium- 201 imaging was lower (78 %) than that of CT (84 %) in identifying high-grade <b>gliomas.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Damage to the blood-brain barrier is a prerequisite for uptake of thallium- 201 in <b>gliomas.</b> Tumors with central necrotic areas and moderate ring enhancement tend to be underestimated when evaluated by means of thallium- 201 scintigraphy. The results indicate a need for caution when interpreting findings on images obtained with thallium- 201 single-photon emission CT in preoperative evaluation of brain tumors...|$|R

25|$|Unlike anandamide, {{formation}} of 2-AG is calcium-dependent and is {{mediated by the}} activities of phospholipase C (PLC) and diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL). 2-AG acts as a full agonist at the CB1 receptor.

25|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{potential of}} synthetic lethality as an efficacious anti-cancer strategy is continually improving. Recently, {{the applicability of}} synthetic lethality to targeted cancer therapy has heightened due to the recent work of scientists including Ronald A. DePinho and colleagues, in what is termed 'collateral lethality'. Muller et al. found that passenger genes, with chromosomal proximity to tumor suppressor genes, are collaterally deleted in some cancers. Thus, the identification of collaterally deleted redundant genes carrying out an essential cellular function may be the untapped reservoir for then pursing a synthetic lethality approach. Collateral lethality therefore holds great potential in identification of novel and selective therapeutic targets in oncology. In 2012, Muller et al. identified that homozygous deletion of redundant-essential glycolytic ENO1 gene in human glioblastoma (GBM) is the consequence of proximity to 1p36 tumor suppressor locus deletions and may hold potential for a synthetic lethality approach to GBM inhibition. ENO1 {{is one of three}} homologous genes (ENO2, ENO3) that encodes the mammalian alpha-enolase enzyme. ENO2, which encodes enolase 2, is mostly expressed in neural tissues, leading to the postulation that in ENO1-deleted GBM, ENO2 may be the ideal target as the redundant homologue of ENO1. Muller found that both genetic and pharmacological ENO2 inhibition in GBM cells with homozygous ENO1 deletion elicits a synthetic lethality outcome by selective killing of GBM cells). In 2016, Muller and colleagues discovered antibiotic SF2312 as a highly potent nanomolar-range enolase inhibitor which preferentially inhibits <b>glioma</b> cell proliferation and glycolytic flux in ENO1-deleted cells. SF2312 was shown to be more efficacious than pan-enolase inhibitor PhAH and have more specificity for ENO2 inhibition over ENO1. Subsequent work by the same team showed that the same approach could be applied to pancreatic cancer, whereby homozygously deleted SMAD4 results in the collateral deletion of mitochondrial malic enzyme 2 (ME2), an oxidative decarboxylase essential for redox homeostasis. Dey et al. show that ME2 genomic deletion in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells results in high endogenous reactive oxygen species, consistent with KRAS-driven pancreatic cancer, and essentially primes ME2-null cells for synthetic lethality by depletion of redundant NAD(P)+-dependent isoform ME3. The effects of ME3 depletion were found to be mediated by inhibition of de novo nucleotide synthesis resulting from AMPK activation and mitochondrial ROS-mediated apoptosis. Meanwhile, Oike et al. demonstrated the generalizability of the concept by targeting redundant essential-genes in process other than metabolism, namely the SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 subunits in the chromatin-remodeling SWI/SNF complex.|$|E
