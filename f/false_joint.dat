60|$|Absorption often {{plays an}} {{important}} part in the repair of injuries. When a bone is broken and does not unite, the ends are absorbed and rounded, so that a <b>false</b> <b>joint</b> is formed; or if the ends unite, but overlap, the projecting parts are removed. (24/7. Prof. Marey's discussion on the power of co- adaptation {{in all parts of the}} organisation is excellent. 'La Machine Animale' 1873 chapter 9. See also Paget 'Lectures' etc. page 257.) A dislocated bone will form for itself a new socket. Displaced tendons and varicose veins excavate new channels in the bones against which they press. But absorption comes into action, as Virchow remarks, during the normal growth of bones; parts which are solid during youth become hollowed out for the medullary tissue as the bone increases in size. In trying to understand the many well- adapted cases of regrowth when aided by absorption, we should remember that almost all parts of the organisation, even whilst retaining the same form, undergo constant renewal; so that a part which is not renewed would be liable to absorption.|$|E
50|$|Pseudarthrosis (commonly {{referred}} to as a nonunion or <b>false</b> <b>joint)</b> is a bone fracture that has no chance of mending without intervention. In pseudarthrosis the body perceives bone fragments as separate bones and does not attempt to unite them. Often this is the result of inadequate healing after the fracture, though it can also be the result of a developmental failure. In the U.S., FDA guidelines allow a period of 9 months for fracture union, after which intervention is considered to facilitate union.|$|E
5000|$|The Greek stem [...] "pseudo-" [...] means false and [...] "arthrosis" [...] means joint. Pseudarthrosis, then, is a <b>false</b> <b>joint.</b> In {{the case}} of a [...] "non-union", a {{fracture}} that does not heal, this is often evidenced by the obliteration of the medullary cavity of a long bone {{at the site of the}} non union. This non union is not a true joint, and has no ligamentous support, but often has motion, and remodels into a rounded end that looks like a true joint.|$|E

40|$|Congenital <b>false</b> <b>joint</b> of shin {{occurs in}} 1 case per 28 000 - 190 000 live births, {{but it is}} hard-to-treat and {{disabling}} disease. Objective: Improving treatment outcomes, {{reducing the number of}} surgical interventions for the treatment of congenital <b>false</b> <b>joint</b> of shin. Materials and Methods. The method is carried out using staged plaster casts with the gradual correction of deformities. When axis of the leg approximates to the normal one, axial load is added. First, it is done by tapping on the heel. When the child was 7 - 8 months old he was put on the legs and taught to walk. The plaster bandage is replaced by "Scotch cast" and "soft cast" bandage. The treatment lasted up to reaching of clinical effect – correction of shin deformation and absence of pathological mobility. Clinical effect must be confirmed by roentgenography which must demonstrate filling of <b>false</b> <b>joint</b> zone with bone tissue and restoration of intramedullary canal. During all the period of treating alternate courses of electrophoresis with calcium chloride, medical mud extracts and magnetic therapy are conducted. In the period from 1995 till 2015 in the Regional Zaporizhzhia Children Clinical Hospital 4 children (6 shins) aged from 1 to 7 months with <b>false</b> <b>joint</b> of shin were treated using proposed method. Results and discussion. All 4 children (6 shins) treated in clinic with proposed conservative method showed filling of <b>false</b> <b>joint</b> zone with bone tissue, restoration of intramedullary canal and significant extension of axis of the shin. The load on the leg in early terms results in compression of bone fragments (as in compression-distraction osteosynthesis), magnetic therapy, electrophoresis with calcium chloride and medical mud extracts promote active functioning of the muscles that improves regional blood supply and improves osteogenesis. Conclusions. Using the proposed method of treatment of congenital <b>false</b> <b>joint</b> of shins in newborns and infants can allow avoiding surgical intervention and disability of the child. The problem of congenital shin <b>false</b> <b>joint</b> treatment in children is not fully settled and needs further study and solution. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} arthroplasties depend on removal of bone {{to create a}} mobile “ <b>false</b> <b>joint.</b> ” It is {{generally}} accepted that a wide gap {{at the site of}} bone removal is desirable. To achieve this, traction {{in one form or another}} is usually applied to the part of the limb distal to the arthroplasty, with the object of maintaining an adequate gap at the <b>false</b> <b>joint</b> during the first few weeks of healing. Some surgeons believe that traction is desirable after arthroplasty of the first metatarso-phalangeal joint, particularly when the operation is used to relieve hallux rigidus. Pulp traction, through a pin or nylon suture, is perhaps the method most commonly employed. Bonney and Macnab (1952) made an exhaustive analysis of the many factors which might be assumed to influence the late results of operations for hallux valgus and hallux rigidus. In referring to the effects of traction they stated: “ Since a good ‘ joint space ‘ is usually linked to a good functional result, it may be asked whether this may be ensured by continuous post-operative traction on the phalanx. Though the initial joint space may be large there is no certainty that it will remain so, and attempts to maintain a wide space in the first two post-operative weeks thus appear to be misdirected.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Wear particles, {{found at}} the bone-implant {{interface}} surrounding a loose prosthesis, are commonly phagocytosed by macrophages. Wear particles and wear particle-containing macrophages are also found in regional lymph nodes draining arthroplasty tissues. The means by which wear particles are transported from arthroplasty tissues to lymph nodes is uncertain, as {{the presence or absence}} of lymphatic vessels in periprosthetic tissues has not been established. METHODS: We determined immunophenotypic expression of LYVE- 1 and podoplanin, two highly specific lymphatic endothelial cell markers, in the hip arthroplasty pseudocapsule surrounding the <b>false</b> <b>joint</b> and the bone-implant interface of the femoral and acetabular pseu-domembrane. RESULTS: LYVE- 1 +/podoplanin+ lymphatic vessels were not identified in the pseudomembrane but were found in the pseudocapsule. Normal bone did not contain lymphatic vessels. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that the wear particles shed at the bone-implant interface are not transported to draining lymph nodes by lymphatics directly from the pseudomembrane, but via the pseudocapsule. The absence of a lymphatic clearance mechanism may contribute to accumulation of wear particles at the bone-implant interface and promote periprosthetic osteolysis through stimulation of osteoclast formation and activity...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: We {{report a}} patient who {{developed}} nonunion of both bones of the forearm associated with hyperparathyroidism (HPT). Presentation of case: The patient was a 71 -year-old female who previously fell and hit her left hand on the ground. At 2 years after injury the patient visited our hospital, since she became aware of instability of the left forearm without an inducer due to nonunion of the radioulnar diaphysis. The patient was surgically treated to acquire forearm support. Surgery for nonunion was applied only to the ulna. To acquire an elbow joint flexion angle, an about 30 ° angle {{was added to the}} <b>false</b> <b>joint</b> region. At one year after surgery, blood testing suggested HPT, however, the parathyroid mass was not excised following the current guidelines for management of HPT. At 7 years after surgery, the elbow range of motion, VAS and the Q-DASH score were improved. Weight-bearing by the forearm became possible, and the patient can perform pronation and supination at the radial nonunion. Discussion: We learned from this case {{that it is necessary to}} immediately perform close examination to identify the presence or absence of primary disease causing insufficiency fracture, such as HPT. For treatment of nonunion of the 2 forearm bones in this elderly female, osteosynthesis of the ulna alone achieved sufficient osteal support without osteosynthesis of the radius, and the postoperative course was favorable.

40|$|Objectives: to {{investigate}} the long-term outcomes of femoral neck fractures that were surgically fixed using various types of extramedullary implants in patients aged 65 years and younger. Material and methods: We analyzed the clinical results of surgical treatment of femoral neck fractures by extramedullary osteosynthesis in 94 patients aged 38 to 65 years old (71 women and 23 men). The patients were divided into 3 groups according to AO/ASIF fracture classification. We used different techniques of osteosynthesis: with DHS or with Targon FN. In all patients the mental status rate SPMSQ), osteoporosis degree (Singh index), general somatic status (WHO scale) were evaluated in the preoperative period. We also evaluated next intraoperative parameters: duration of surgery, blood loss, quality of reduction, long of incision. In a year after surgery we assessed functional results (Harris Hip Score) and analysed postoperative complications. Results: It was found the inverse correlation (r = - 0, 8) of total preoperative parameters (WHO scale, the Singh index and mental status SPMSQ) and postoperative functional results on Harris Hip Score. With the reliability of p< 0. 05 the average rate of blood loss and length of skin incision were less in patients operated with Targon FN. In 12 months unsatisfactory results rate on Harris Hip Score was 12. 7 % in all study groups, great - 22, 3 %, good - 52. 1 %, and satisfactory - 12, 9 %.

50|$|Although nerve blocks {{are very}} {{important}} to the lameness examination, they are not foolproof. Multiple {{studies have shown that the}} anesthetic can migrate, especially if the horse is evaluated long after blocking or if a large amount of anesthetic is used. If the anesthetic migrates to the structure that is causing the horse pain, the horse will have a positive block, and the examiner will conclude that the lameness originates in an area that is not actually causing the horse discomfort. False results can also be secondary to practitioner error if the anesthetic is accidentally administered into a location that was unintended, such as a synovial structure rather than around a nerve. Additionally, individual horses have variation in their neural anatomy, and if atypical patterns are present, a given block may block an area unintended by the examiner, leading to <b>false</b> positives. <b>Joints</b> present additional problems. A large volume of anesthetic placed into a joint can diffuse out over time, blocking the surrounding structures. Additionally, there are some cases where joint pain can respond better to perineural blocking rather than blocking of the joint.|$|R
