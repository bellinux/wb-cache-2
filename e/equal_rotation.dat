40|$|The {{strength}} and ductility of the coupling beams in coupled shear walls can significantly affect the nonlinear behaviour and earthquake resistance of the whole building structure. However, although extensive testing of coupling beams has been performed, the boundary conditions-that the rotations at the two ends of a coupling beam are equal and that local deformation occurs at the beam-wall joints, which could have substantial influence on the test results-have not been correctly simulated. Herein, a new method of testing reinforced concrete coupling beams that ensures <b>equal</b> <b>rotations</b> {{at the ends of}} the beam specimen and takes into account local deformation at the beam-wall joints is developed. The method has been successfully applied to test typical reinforced concrete coupling beams with relatively small span/depth ratios and proven to be suitable for studying the post-peak behaviour and failure characteristics of short coupling beams. Test results obtained so far indicate that reinforced concrete coupling beams with small span/depth ratios behave quite differently from ordinary beams in frame structures and that the local deformation at beam-wall joints is quite substantial. Complete load-deflection curves have been acquired and the {{strength and}} ductility of the coupling beams evaluated. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{thermodynamic}} and gravitational stability of Kerr anti-de Sitter black holes in five and higher dimensions. We show, {{in the case}} of <b>equal</b> <b>rotation</b> parameters, $a_i=a$, that the Kerr-AdS background metrics become stable, both thermodynamically and gravitationally, when the rotation parameters $a_i$ take values comparable to the AdS curvature radius. In turn, a Kerr-AdS black hole can be in thermal equilibrium with the thermal radiation around it only when the rotation parameters become not significantly smaller than the AdS curvature radius. We also find with <b>equal</b> <b>rotation</b> parameters that a Kerr-AdS black hole is thermodynamically favored against the existence of a thermal AdS space, while the opposite behavior is observed {{in the case of}} a single non-zero rotation parameter. The five dimensional case is however different and also special in that there is no high temperature thermal AdS phase regardless of the choice of rotation parameters. We also verify that at fixed entropy, the temperature of a rotating black hole is always bounded above by that of a non-rotating black hole, in four and five dimensions, but not in six and more dimensions (especially, when the entropy approaches zero or the minimum of entropy does not correspond to the minimum of temperature). In this last context, the six dimensional case is marginal. Comment: 15 pages, 23 eps figures, RevTex...|$|E
40|$|Six {{large scale}} models of {{conventionally}} reinforced concrete coupling beams with span/depth ratios ranging from 1. 17 to 2. 00 were tested under monotonically applied shear loads to study their nonlinear behavior using a newly developed test method that maintained <b>equal</b> <b>rotations</b> {{at the two}} ends of the coupling beam specimen and allowed for local deformations at the beam-wall joints. By conducting the tests under displacement control, the post-peak behavior and complete load-deflection curves of the coupling beams were obtained for investigation. It was found that after the appearance of flexural and shear cracks, a deep coupling beam would gradually transform itself from an ordinary beam to a truss composed of diagonal concrete struts and longitudinal and transverse steel reinforcement bars. Moreover, in a deep coupling beam, the local deformations at the beam-wall joints could contribute significantly (up {{to the order of}} 50 %) to the total deflection of the coupling beam, especially at the post-peak stage. Finally, although a coupling beam failing in shear would have a relatively low ductility ratio of only 5 or even lower, a coupling beam failing in flexure could have a relatively high ductility ratio of 10 or higher. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

In the limit of vanishing Rossby numbers in geostrophic flows, cyclonic LAVD vortex centers are precisely the observed attractors for light particles. A similar result holds for heavy particles in anticyclonic LAVD vortices.

The latter are formed by tubular surfaces of <b>equal</b> material <b>rotation</b> rate, objectively measured by the Instantaneous Vorticity Deviation (IVD).

Methods: A cattle urine treatment and re-treatment schedule was used, including a box {{with a piece of}} cloth retreated with urine daily, and once after 3 and 7 day. Resting box with piece of black cloth not treated with urine was used as a control. Each treatment was made in pair for indoor and outdoor sampling.

40|$|To better {{understand}} how hippocampal place cell activity is controlled by sensory stimuli, and to further elucidate {{the nature of the}} environmental representation provided by place cells, we have made recordings in the presence of two distinct visual stimuli under standard conditions and after several manipulations of these stimuli. In line {{with a great deal of}} earlier work, we find that place cell activity is constant when repeated recordings are made in the standard conditions in which the centers of the two stimuli, a black card and a white card, are separated by 135 ° on the wall of a cylindrical recording chamber. Rotating the two stimuli by 45 ° causes <b>equal</b> <b>rotations</b> of place cell firing fields. Removing either card and rotating the other card also causes fields to rotate equally, showing that the two stimuli are individually salient. Increasing or decreasing the card separation (card reconfiguration) causes a topological distortion of the representation of the cylinder floor such that field centers move relative to each other. We also found that either kind of reconfiguration induces a position-independent decrease in the intensity of place cell firing. We argue that these results are not compatible with either of two previously stated views of the place cell representation; namely, a nonspatial theory in which each place cell is tuned to an arbitrarily selected subset of available stimuli or a rigid map theory. We propose that our results imply that the representation is map-like but not rigid; it is capable of undergoing stretches without altering the local arrangement of firing fields...|$|R
