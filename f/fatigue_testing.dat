40|$|AbstractA helium inlet and {{dummy joint}} between {{conductors}} {{are one of}} the most important elements of the winding pack of the ITER PF - 1 coil double pancakes. A helium inlet is used for letting liquid helium into the PF- 1 coil conductor. A full-scale helium inlet sample for <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> and the respective tooling were designed and manufactured. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> of the full-scale helium inlet sample were conducted in accordance with ITER requirements testing parameters in order to check the fatigue strength of the structure. Before the <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> thermo-cycling of the helium inlet in the temperature range of 77  to 293  K was conducted. Before and after the <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> the leak tightness of the full-scale helium inlet sample was validated by the vacuum chamber method. A low ohm electrical joint is used to connect two NbTi «CICC» conductors of PF- 1 coil into a single electrical loop. To qualify the design and technology of manufacturing of the electrical joint, a full-scale dummy joint sample was developed for <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> at 77  K. The main design feature of the full-scale dummy joint sample for <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> is a symmetrical model of two dummy joint samples with simultaneous loading to compensate the bending moment. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> of the full-scale helium inlet sample at 77  K have been successfully conducted in 2013. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> of the full-scale dummy joint sample will be conducted in 2014.

A $1.5 billion program, known as H-Mod, to re-wing the 76 completed C-5As to restore full payload capability and service life began in 1976. After design and testing of the new wing design, the C-5As received their new wings from 1980 to 1987. During 1976, numerous cracks were also found in the fuselage along the upper fuselage on the centerline, aft of the refueling port, extending back to the wing. The cracks required a redesign to the hydraulic system for the visor, the front cargo entry point.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe work {{deals with}} the {{parameters}} identification and the experimental validation of a phenomenological model for fatigue anisotropic damage in short glass fiber reinforced polyamide (PA 6 -GF 30). The damage fatigue model has been formulated in terms of strain energy and was implemented into the finite element code ABAQUS/Standard through a user defined material subroutine UMAT. The present paper focuses mainly on the identification strategy based on homogeneous and heterogeneous <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests.</b> Damage parameters governing longitudinal and transversal damage (dLL and dTT) are identified from homogeneous tension-tension <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> performed in both material directions. The damage parameters governing the shear induced damage (dLT) are identified using heterogeneous <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> carried out on a specific configuration. This heterogeneous <b>fatigue</b> <b>test</b> gives rise to non-uniform distributions of the in-plane strain components: ɛLL, ɛTT and ɛLT. Heterogeneous strain fields are measured by the digital image correlation technique (DIC) during the <b>fatigue</b> <b>test.</b> The in-plane strain components are coupled to numerical computations through an inverse method to determine the parameters set governing the shear induced damage.
