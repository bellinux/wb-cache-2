5|$|After {{directing}} {{and writing}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> in New York, Rossen moved to Hollywood in 1937. There {{he worked as}} a screenwriter for Warner Bros. until 1941, and then interrupted his career to serve until 1944 as the chairman of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization, a body to organize writers for the effort in World War II. In 1945 he joined a picket line against Warner Bros. After making one film for Hal Wallis's newly formed production company, Rossen made one for Columbia Pictures, another for Wallis and most of his later films for his own companies, usually in collaboration with Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from around}} 50 songs, Meyerbeer wrote little except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> The {{critical}} assaults of Wagner and his supporters, especially after his death, {{led to a}} decline in the popularity of his works; his operas were suppressed by the Nazi regime in Germany, and were neglected by opera houses through most of the twentieth century. In the 21st century, however, the composer's major French grand operas have begun to reappear in the repertory of numerous European opera houses.|$|E

5|$|Ariel {{appears in}} the Broadway {{adaptation}} of the 1989 film, which ran at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre with previews from November 3, 2007, leading to opening night on January 10, 2008. This original production closed on August 30, 2009, but other US and international productions have followed since. The character of Ariel <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> adaptation was originated by Sierra Boggess, with the role also portrayed later by actresses Chelsea Morgan Stock and Michelle Lookadoo. Jodi Benson, the original voice actress for Ariel, attended the musical's opening night.|$|E
5|$|Director Michael Mayer {{heard the}} album and {{expressed}} an interest in adapting it <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> When he approached the band regarding a collaboration, they agreed to work with him. The band also gave Mayer a wide latitude for his adaptation after seeing his earlier work in Spring Awakening. Though additional songs were included from the Green Day catalog, Mayer added very little dialogue to the show. He felt instead that the music and lyrics were expressive enough on their own, and even removed some of the dialogue {{that was part of the}} Berkeley production before the show moved to Broadway.|$|E
5|$|Dixon was {{primarily}} hired {{to tone down}} much of the campiness inherent in the stage musical. The 2007 film's script is based primarily on the stage musical rather than the 1988 film, so several changes already made to the plot <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> version remain in this version. These include dropping several characters from the 1988 version (such as Arvin Hodgepile (the role Mr. Spritzer fills), Velma's husband Franklin, Corny's assistant Tammy, the beatniks, et al.), removing the Tilted Acres amusement park from the story, and placing Velma {{in charge of the}} station where The Corny Collins Show is filmed.|$|E

5|$|However, {{there is}} little {{evidence}} that Fielding lacked funds, or that such a lack of funds would cause him to leave Leyden to return to writing plays; Fielding eventually returned to Leyden on 22 February 1729. It is not know when or why Fielding left the school, but he produced The Temple Beau on 26 January 1730, which suggests that he returned to London by November 1729. By the time of his return, he had three plays, either still in draft form or complete: Don Quixote in England, The Wedding-Day and The Temple Beau. Of these, only The Temple Beau was accepted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1950, British actress Gertrude Lawrence's {{business}} manager and attorney, Fanny Holtzmann, {{was looking for}} a new vehicle for her client when the 1944 Margaret Landon novel Anna and the King of Siam (a fictionalized version of Leonowens' experiences) was sent to her by Landon's agent. According to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, Holtzmann was worried that Lawrence's career was fading. The 51-year-old actress had appeared only in plays, not in musicals, since Lady in the Dark closed in 1943. Holtzmann agreed that a musical based on Anna and the King of Siam would be ideal for her client, who purchased the rights to adapt the novel <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} before the {{beginning}} of the race, there was controversy over the first stage. On arriving at the start, the teams discovered that the route used a variety of road surfaces, crossed sandy sections and included several ramps. As a result, the race organisers decided to neutralise the stage: the teams therefore competed only <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> victory and for the team classification, not for the general classification.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1970s, Kneale {{made his}} only attempt at writing a stage play. Called Crow, {{it was based}} upon the memoirs of real-life Manx slaver Captain Hugh Crow. Kneale {{was unable to find}} backing to produce the play <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> but sold the script to ATV who put it into {{pre-production}} for television. However, shortly before filming it was cancelled by order of ATV's managing director, Lew Gradeâ€”Kneale was never told why.|$|E
5|$|Lie is {{considered}} influential to the colony's journalism, linguistics, and literature. According to the Malaysian scholar Ahmad Adam, {{he is best}} remembered for his literary works. Several of his writings were printed multiple times, and Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari was adapted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> and screen. However, {{as a result of}} the language politics in the Indies and independent Indonesia, his work has become marginalised. When several of his writings were revealed as uncredited adaptations of existing works, Lie was criticised as unoriginal. Other critics, however, have found evidence of innovation in his writing style and handling of plots.|$|E
5|$|Monteverdi was an {{established}} court composer {{in the service}} of Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga in Mantua when he wrote his first operas, L'Orfeo and L'Arianna, in the years 1606â€“08. After falling out with Vincenzo's successor, Duke Francesco Gonzaga, Monteverdi moved to Venice in 1613 and became director of music at St Mark's Basilica, a position he held {{for the rest of his}} life. Alongside his steady output of madrigals and church music, Monteverdi continued to compose works <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> though not actual operas. He wrote several ballets and, for the Venice carnival of 1624â€“25, Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda ("The Battle of Tancred and Clorinda"), a hybrid work with some characteristics of ballet, opera and oratorio.|$|E
