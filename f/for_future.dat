40|$|We {{present a}} class of multi-factor {{stochastic}} models <b>for</b> energy <b>futures</b> prices, similar to the interest rate futures models recently formulated by Heath. We do not postulate directly the risk-neutral processes followed by futures prices, but define energy futures prices {{in terms of a}} spot price, not directly observable, driven by several stochastic factors. Our formulation leads to an expression <b>for</b> <b>futures</b> prices which is well suited to the application of Kalman filtering techniques together with maximum likelihood estimation methods. Based on these techniques, we perform an empirical study of a one- and a two-factor model <b>for</b> <b>futures</b> prices <b>for</b> natural gas.
