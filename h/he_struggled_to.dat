5|$|The {{following}} season, <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> earn {{a regular}} {{spot on the}} Rangers' roster and was often a healthy scratch. Rangers head coach John Muckler publicly declared {{before the beginning of}} Malhotra's second NHL campaign that he would be nothing more than a career third-liner. Malhotra's potential was often at the centre of an ongoing dispute between Muckler and Smith.|$|E
5|$|Burns {{started his}} cricket career with Cumberland in 1988, but moved to Warwickshire in late 1990. <b>He</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> {{break into the}} first team with his new county, {{and spent most of}} his time with the club playing in the second team. As a wicket-keeper, his {{opportunities}} were limited by the presence of Keith Piper, and he failed to make an impact as a batsman when he was given chances in the first team. He only started to play regularly for the county in 1996, but opted to move to Somerset the following year.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{soon found}} {{work with a}} new company, and went on tour with his brother – who was also {{pursuing}} an acting career – in a comedy sketch called Repairs. In May 1906, Chaplin joined the juvenile act Casey's Circus, where he developed popular burlesque pieces and was soon {{the star of the}} show.

In the newly formed Premier League, <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> sustain the club's domestic successes, {{and was replaced by}} Roy Evans midway through the 1993–94 season. Liverpool improved to fourth the following season and won the Football League Cup. In 1998, Gérard Houllier was appointed co-manager alongside Evans. The arrangement lasted until November when Evans resigned and Houllier became the sole mananger. The club won a unique treble of trophies in 2001, and a year later finished second to Arsenal, their highest league finish in 11 years. Houllier departed the club in mid-2004.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} as a producer, West's true {{aspiration}} {{was to be a}} rapper. Though he had developed his rapping long before he began producing, it was often a challenge for West to be accepted as a rapper, and <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> attain a record deal. Multiple record companies ignored him because he did not portray the 'gangsta image' prominent in mainstream hip hop at the time. After a series of meetings with Capitol Records, West was ultimately denied an artist deal.|$|E
5|$|Leeds United manager George Graham signed Hasselbaink in {{the summer}} of 1997 for a fee of £2 million.

He scored only five league goals before Christmas, but ended the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions following a strong second half of the season.|$|E

His major storylines see him operate {{on his own}} sister, fear {{that he may have}} Motor Neurone Disease, lose his spleen after being shot in a road rage incident, and ultimately depart from Holby for Michigan when the hospital Board make impositions on his autonomy. Irving made the decision to leave the series as <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> set the character aside outside of work, which had a negative impact on his personal life. He ruled out the possibility of returning to Holby City in future, preferring his memory of Meyer to remain untarnished.|$|E
5|$|Morris found batting {{difficult}} {{for the first few}} weeks of the tour, as <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> adapt to the unfamiliar batting conditions. He reached 50 only twice in the nine innings after the Worcestershire match, totalling only 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly, he was liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Britain, Beadles played amateur {{football}} for his local side Newtown and Liverpool based side Grayson's before being spotted by First Division side Liverpool, where {{he was part of}} consecutive First Division title winning sides in 1921–22 and 1922–23. However, <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> establish himself in the first team, making 18 appearances during his 3 seasons at Anfield. He joined Cardiff City in August 1924 where he spent less than two seasons, including playing in the 1925 FA Cup Final, before being sold to Sheffield Wednesday in an attempt to raise funds as the club experienced financial difficulties.|$|E

He was restored to the first team on 15 December for a match against Wolverhampton Wanderers, but conceded three goals. <b>He</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> regain his form in the remainder of the season, leading to calls from some fans and media for him to retire. Others criticised the club, believing that Trautmann had been forced to play while still not fully recovered from injury.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{moving in}} with Borthwick in the winter 1911, Wright resumed work on his {{architectural}} projects, but <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> secure commissions because of the ongoing negative publicity over his affair with Borthwick (whose ex-husband, Edwin Cheney, maintained main custody of their son and daughter). However, Wright did produce {{some of his most}} acclaimed works during this time period, including the Midway Gardens in Chicago and the Avery Coonley Playhouse in Riverside. He also indulged his hobby for collecting Japanese art, and quickly became a renowned authority. Borthwick translated four works from Swedish difference feminist Ellen Key.|$|E
5|$|Abu Musa Isa ibn al-Shaykh ibn al-Salil al-Dhuhli al-Shaybani (died 882/83) was an Arab {{leader of}} the Shayban tribe. Taking {{advantage}} of the domestic turmoil of the Abbasid Caliphate, he created a semi-independent bedouin state in Palestine and southern Syria in ca. 867–870, before an Abbasid army forced him to exchange his domains with the governorship of Armenia and Diyar Bakr. In Armenia, <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> contain the rising power of the Christian princes, but after failing to suppress the revolt {{of one of his}} own subordinates, he abandoned the country and returned to his native Jazira.
