Questions should be designed to promote lively conversation and insights about the book; they should be open questions. A person with this task asks these questions of the group to prompt discussion; overall, the job is to keep the group talking and on-task.

5000|$|Gould's {{interest}} {{in music and}} his talent as a pianist became evident very early. Both his parents were musical, and his mother, especially, encouraged the infant Gould's early musical development. Before his birth, his mother planned for {{him to become a}} successful musician, and thus exposed him to music during her pregnancy. As a baby, he reportedly hummed instead of crying and wiggled his fingers as if playing chords, leading his doctor to predict that he would [...] "be either a physician or a pianist". By the age of three, Gould's perfect pitch was noticed. He learned to read music before he could read words. When presented with a piano, the young Gould was reported to strike single notes and listen to their long decay, a practice his father Bert noted was different from typical children. Gould's {{interest in}} the piano proceeded side by side with an interest in composition. He would play his own little pieces for family, friends, and sometimes large gatherings, including, in 1938, a performance at the Emmanuel Presbyterian Church (a few blocks from the Gould house) of one of his own compositions. At the age of six, he was taken {{for the first time to}} hear a live musical performance by a celebrated soloist. This left a tremendous impression. He later described the experience:It was Hofmann. It was, I think, his last performance in Toronto, and it was a staggering impression. The only thing I can really remember is that, when I was being brought home in a car, I was in that wonderful state of half-awakeness in which you hear all sorts of incredible sounds <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind.</b> They were all orchestral sounds, but I was playing them all, and suddenly I was Hofmann.

[...] "When you don't have ambient beds <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> whole score," [...] he said, [...] "it means that just the entrance of music has a lot more power.

Ford began her lecture by asking the class “What went <b>through</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> when you decided what you were going to wear today?” This question opened up the class to discover what fashion means to them personally and how it shapes who they are as people. This personalized focus on fashion shifted to how Blacks felt in the 1970 s and how it drove their desire to focus on their own personal brand and {{what it meant to be}} Black in the 1970 s...|$|R
500|$|... "My First Kiss" [...] {{was written}} by Sean Foreman and Nathaniel Motte {{alongside}} Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco. The song was produced by Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco with vocal editing done by Emily Wright. While being interviewed by MTV, Foreman explained the song's inspiration: [...] "The song is about a girl you really like, and the story line of <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> first kiss with a girl to exploring further parts of the relationship." [...] While composing the song, Foreman and Motte decided {{that they needed to}} add a female to the song. Kesha, who had worked with Blanco and Luke, was asked to participate in the song and later came into the studio to contribute her lines.|$|R
60|$|Curly {{entered the}} saloon. And {{now in the}} light it could be {{perceived}} that he bore the stamp of many years of vagabondage. He had none of the tidiness of the calculating and shrewd professional tramp. His wardrobe represented the cast-off specimens {{of half a dozen}} fashions and eras. Two factories had combined their efforts in providing shoes for his feet. As you gazed at him there passed <b>through</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> vague impressions of mummies, wax figures, Russian exiles, and men lost on desert islands. His face was covered almost to his eyes with a curly brown beard that he kept trimmed short with a pocket-knife, and that had furnished him with his /nom de route/. Light-blue eyes, full of sullenness, fear, cunning, impudence, and fawning, witnessed the stress that had been laid upon his soul.|$|R

Unfortunately, this kind of {{reaction}} is common to the social studies teacher in our na-tion’s classrooms. Difficulties in learning to read in content area subjects tend to baffle the teacher and present obstacles to the learner. All this can be overcome by a strategy {{which is based on}} knowledge of how a student learns to read fluently. One solution to the problem is derived from research findings in the fields of memory process-ing and reading (Adams, 1967; Smith, 1971, 1975; Wilson, 1966). From memory processing, we will borrow a principle known as chunking and adapt it to the aim of reading, that is, to get meaning from written language...|$|R
5000|$|For {{an emotion}} we all yearn to feel, {{as much as}} we {{possibly}} can, light-hearted skippyfun can be very, very troublesome to capture in popular music. Too much sugar, as we all know, rots the teeth, and makes people feel sick.

Too much sour is even worse than too much sweet, cos it curdles the whole confection.

The army suffered a severe defeat, forcing Chanakya and Chandragupta to flee the battlefield. They reached a lake while being pursued by an enemy officer. Chanakya asked Chandragupta {{to jump into the}} lake, and disguised himself as a meditating ascetic. When the enemy soldier reached the lake, he asked the 'ascetic' if he had seen Chandragupta. Chanakya pointed at the lake. As the soldier removed his armour to jump into the lake, Chanakya took his sword and killed him. When Chandragupta came out of the water, Chanakya asked him, [...] "What went <b>through</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> when I disclosed your location to the enemy?" [...] Chandragupta replied that he trusted his master to make the best decision. This convinced Chanakya that Chandragupta would remain under his influence even after becoming the king. On another occasion, Chanakya similarly escaped the enemy by chasing away a washerman, and disguising himself as one. Once, he cut open the belly of a Brahmin who had just eaten food, and took out the food to feed a hungry Chandragupta.|$|R
