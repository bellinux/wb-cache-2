50|$|The {{basic idea}} is that the <b>illumination</b> <b>pattern</b> is imaged onto a geometrically {{congruent}} cutoff pattern (essentially a multiplicity of knife edges) with focusing optics, while density gradients lying between the <b>illumination</b> <b>pattern</b> and the cutoff pattern are imaged, typically by a camera system. As in classical schlieren, the distortions produce regions of brightening or darkening corresponding to the position and direction of the distortion, because they redirect rays either away from or onto the opaque part of the cutoff pattern. While in classical schlieren, distortions over the whole beam path are visualized equally, in focusing schlieren, only distortions in the object field of the camera are clearly imaged. Distortions away from the object field become blurred, so this technique allows some degree of depth selection. It also has the advantage that a wide variety of illuminated backgrounds can be used, since collimation is not required. This allows construction of projection-based focusing schlieren systems which are much easier to build and align than classical schlieren systems. The requirement of collimated light in classical schlieren is often a substantial practical barrier for constructing large systems due to the need for the collimating optic to be {{the same size as the}} field of view. Focusing schlieren systems can use compact optics with a large background <b>illumination</b> <b>pattern,</b> which is particularly easy to produce with a projection system. For systems with large demagnification, the <b>illumination</b> <b>pattern</b> needs to be around twice the size of the field of view to allow for defocusing of the background pattern.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In {{the design}} of Reflector antenna systems, the control of sidelobes caused from {{spillover}} of the primary pattern presents a major design challenge. The design of the <b>illumination</b> <b>pattern</b> of the reflector system is key to designing a reflector system that optimizes gain while minimizing {{the level of the}} sidelobes. The reduction of spillover sidelobes requires the use of large aperture feeds that provide a highly tapered <b>illumination</b> <b>pattern.</b> One of the traditional methods for accomplishing this design is the use of large aperture conical or corrugated horns for the feed. These designs are extremely effective for single band feeds but present problems when needed to operate over an extended frequency band. The approach presented in this paper attempts to illustrate a broadband solution to the feed pattern shaping design. The use of a doubly shaped lens placed at the aperture of a multi-band feed is investigated. The investigation is performed on a parabolic antenna system. The first surface of the lens transforms the radiation pattern into a plain wave exiting the feed aperture. The second surface then refocuses the radiation to {{the focal point of the}} reflector’s parabolic surface.
