25|$|The Chennai {{consular}} district, covering {{three states}} and three union territories of the country, serves {{a population of}} about 160 million and includes seven official languages used daily in the post's visa operations. An increasing middle-class population in the region who intend to travel abroad, increase in demand for skilled workforce in the United States, and the transformation of the Indo–U.S. relationship led to an increase in visa demand in the Chennai consular district in recent years. The demand for non-immigrant visas in Chennai increased by more than 80 percent between 2004 and 2007, peaking at around 280,000 in 2007.

25|$|Device {{fingerprinting}} is {{a fairly}} new technology that is useful in <b>fraud</b> <b>prevention</b> and safeguarding any information from one's computer.

ThreatMetrix {{is one of the}} leading vendors of device fingerprinting. This company employs a number of techniques to prevent fraud. For example, ThreatMetrix will pierce the proxy to determine the true location of a device. Due to the growing number of hackers and fraudsters using 'botnets' of millions of computers that are being unknowingly controlled, this technology will help not only the companies at risk but the people who are unaware their computers are being used.|$|E
