5|$|The root {{structure}} of B.prionotes exhibits two common environmental adaptations. Firstly, this species is phreatophytic, that is, its long taproot extends <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table, securing it a continuous water supply through the dry summer months, when surface water is generally unavailable. This not only helps ensure survival over summer, but allows plants to grow then. Though {{the supply of}} water is the taproot's primary function, the ground water obtained typically contains ionic concentrations of chloride, sodium, magnesium, calcium and potassium that are adequate for the plant's nutritional needs.|$|E

The quay west of the Riksdag Building once surrounded the Bank of Sweden and was thus named Bankkajen ("The Bank Quay"), while the streets on southern and northern side are called Norra/Södra Helgeandstrappan ("The Northern/Southern Helgeand Stairs"), all of them named in 1925.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th century Henry VIII of England, after {{watching}} Royal Waterman in a risky manoeuvre shoot the rapids {{created by the}} twenty small arches of Old London Bridge, decided {{to clean up the}} navigation of the Thames.

25|$|There is {{evidence}} on the foreshore {{on the western side}} of the Cape, below the Battery Observation Post (BOP), of a concrete and rock pathway leading from the road <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> where 1940s photographs show a rock jetty in this position. A rusted gearbox lying beside this pathway may be that used in the winch. Above the road is the cutting (somewhat overgrown) where a rail line was laid to winch equipment and supplies from the road and the beach to the Battery Observation Post high on the hill. At the top of the cutting, {{to the side of the}} BOP, is a concrete slab which may have been associated with the rail wagon and winch area.|$|E
500|$|The {{root system}} {{consists}} of a main sinker root, and up to ten lateral roots extending from a non-lignotuberous root crown. The main sinker root grows straight <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table; it may be up to [...] long if the water table is that deep. Typically from [...] in diameter immediately below the root crown, roots become gradually finer with depth, and may be {{less than half a}} centimetre (0.2in) wide just above the water table. Upon reaching the water table, the sinker branches out into a network of very fine roots. The laterals radiate out horizontally {{from the base of the}} plant, at a depth of [...] They may extend over [...] from the plant, and may bear secondary laterals; larger laterals often bear auxiliary sinker roots. Lateral roots seasonally form secondary rootlets from which grow dense surface mats of proteoid roots, which function throughout the wetter months before dying off with the onset of summer.|$|E
500|$|The {{interior}} courtyard measures approximately [...] on {{each side}} and was completely enclosed by the palace, creating a very private space within. The buildings on the north, west and south sides faced outwards away from the private courtyard, opening onto it only via a central doorway in each structure. The eastern structure was built at a later date, has two lateral doorways and was the only side to face directly onto the courtyard; it highly {{may have been the}} residence of the city's ruler. Entrance to the courtyard is from the exterior the acropolis via these central doorways on the north, south and west sides. Of these three entrances, the northern entrance appears to have been the main entrance to the acropolis complex. The south entrance was a more private entrance that opened from the acropolis onto the terraces leading <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> source in that direction. The western entrance lead to the terrace [...] above the causeway, providing a balcony with an excellent view across the city.|$|E

The dress is completed by slippers, to protect the feet from the shingle, and a straw hat, neatly trimmed to protect the fair wearer's complexion".|$|E
2500|$|Mosquito {{habits of}} oviposition, {{the ways in}} which they lay their eggs, vary {{considerably}} between species, and the morphologies of the eggs vary accordingly. The simplest procedure is that followed by many species of Anopheles; like many other gracile species of aquatic insects, females just fly over the water, bobbing up and <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> surface and dropping eggs more or less singly. The bobbing behavior occurs among some other aquatic insects as well, for example mayflies and dragonflies; it is sometimes called [...] "dapping". The eggs of Anopheles species are roughly cigar-shaped and have floats down their sides. Females of many common species can lay 100–200 eggs during the course of the adult phase of their lifecycles. Even with high egg and intergenerational mortality, over a period of several weeks, a single successful breeding pair can create a population of thousands.|$|E

2500|$|While in bivouac in the Jordan Valley, it was {{a common}} {{practice}} when things were quiet, for soldiers to ride the few miles to Rujm El Bahr, at {{the northern end of}} the Dead Sea where the Jordan River runs in, to bathe themselves and their horses. This inland sea is about [...] long and about [...] wide with steep mountain country sloping <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> on each side. The surface of the sea lies [...] below the sea-level of the Mediterranean and the water is extremely salty, containing about 25% mineral salts and is extremely buoyant; many of the horses were obviously perplexed at floating so high out of the water. It has been calculated that 6,500,000 tons of water fall into the Dead Sea daily from various streams, and as the sea has no outlet all of this water evaporates creating the humid heat of the atmosphere in the valley. There were also opportunities to swim in the Jordan River.|$|E

In this the plan was most successful. The enemy {{made no attempt to}} counter-attack, only desultory sniping. The re-embarkation began at approximately 07:30 under cover of 18-type smoke generators on the beach and naval smoke floats on the water. The wide, flat beach and rapidly ebbing tide made re-embarkation difficult, and the troops had to wade out up to their necks to reach the landing-craft which had waited unmolested fifty yards off-shore throughout the operation. The Commandos had to wade out to the LCAs because the fast-ebbing tide threatened to strand any craft that touched down. Goatley collapsible boats were brought in by an LCA crew to help cover the water gap, widening by the fast ebbing tide. German prisoners were used to carry the wounded <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> where they were placed in the Goatley boats for the trip out to the LCA. By 08:15, the LCAs had re-embarked the raiders.

2500|$|After 1800, {{the success}} of the first New Town led to grander schemes. The 'Northern New Town' aimed to extend Edinburgh from the north of Queen Street Gardens towards the Water of Leith, with {{extensions}} to the east and west. [...] These developments took place mostly between 1800-1830. [...] Initial designs followed the original grid orientation of Craig’s First New Town, with entire streets being built as one construction. Building continued on an extended Hanover Street, called Dundas Street and, beyond Great King Street, Pitt Street (later renamed to Dundas Street in the 1960s), almost 1km north towards the Water of Leith at Canonmills. Broad streets and were laid out to either side. The Picardy Place extension (including Broughton Street, Union Street and East London Street) was mostly finished by 1809. [...] To the west of the original New Town, Shandwick Place, an extension of Princes Street, was started in 1805. [...] Development of Melville Street and the area north of Shandwick Place followed in 1825. [...] The Gayfield Estate (Gayfield Square) extension was designed in 1807 and from around 1813 the New Town gradually replaced and developed the older village of Stockbridge. The painter Henry Raeburn bought the Deanhough estate in the northwest of the New Town and started development in 1813 with Ann Street named after his wife. In 1822 the Earl of Moray, had plans drawn up to develop his estates (including Moray Place) also in the northwest of the New Town sloping <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Water</b> of Leith.|$|E
