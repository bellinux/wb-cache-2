5|$|By {{contrast}} with their tendency towards <b>extreme</b> <b>length,</b> the vaults of English cathedrals are low compared {{with many of}} those found in other countries. The highest medieval stone vault in England is at Westminster Abbey at , that at York Minster being of the same height but despite its appearance, not actually of stone, but wood. The majority of English cathedrals have vaults ranging in height from 20–26 metres (65–86feet). These {{contrast with}} cathedrals such as Beauvais, Amiens and Cologne with internal heights of over 42 metres (140ft).|$|E
5|$|The lyrics' {{reference}} to an <b>extreme</b> <b>length</b> {{of time is}} accentuated by the stretching out of an already slow 6/8 metre into 9/8, and, during the verses, by the appending of a measure-long instrumental tag after each two bars of vocal melody. Partly {{as a result of}} the absence of resolution in the home key, the descending bassline in the verses – a 4-3-2-1 sequence of notes mirroring the IV-iii-ii-I chord pattern – establishes an almost subliminal tonic.|$|E
5|$|The <b>extreme</b> <b>length</b> of Æthelberht's reign {{also has}} been {{regarded}} with skepticism by historians; {{it has been suggested}} that he died in the fifty-sixth year of his life, rather than the fifty-sixth year of his reign. This would place the year of his birth approximately at 560, and he would not then have been able to marry until the mid 570s. According to Gregory of Tours, Charibert was king when he married Ingoberg, Bertha's mother, which places that marriage no earlier than 561. It therefore is unlikely that Bertha was married much before about 580. These later dates for Bertha and Æthelberht also solve another possible problem: Æthelberht's daughter, Æthelburh, seems likely to have been Bertha's child, but the earlier dates would have Bertha aged sixty or so at Æthelburh's likely birthdate using the early dates.|$|E

25|$|The {{structure}} of DNA shows {{a variety of}} forms, both double-stranded and single-stranded. The mechanical properties of DNA, which {{are directly related to}} its structure, are a significant problem for cells. Every process which binds or reads DNA is able to use or modify the mechanical properties of DNA for purposes of recognition, packaging and modification. The <b>extreme</b> <b>length</b> (a chromosome may contain a 10cm long DNA strand), relative rigidity and helical {{structure of}} DNA has led to the evolution of histones and of enzymes such as topoisomerases and helicases to manage a cell's DNA. The properties of DNA are closely related to its molecular structure and sequence, particularly the weakness of the hydrogen bonds and electronic interactions that hold strands of DNA together compared to the strength of the bonds within each strand.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the extent}} of the hindwings onto most of the animal's foot, many {{scientists}} have suggested that Microraptor would have been awkward during normal ground movement or running. The front wing feathers would also have hindered Microraptor when on the ground, due to the limited range of motion in the wrist and the <b>extreme</b> <b>length</b> of the wing feathers. A 2010 study by Corwin Sullivan and colleagues showed that, even with the wing folded as far as possible, the feathers would still have dragged along the ground if the arms were held in a neutral position, or extended forward as in a predatory strike. Only by keeping the wings elevated, or the upper arm extended fully backward, could Microraptor have avoided damaging the wing feathers. Therefore, it may have been anatomically impossible for Microraptor to have used its clawed forelimbs in capturing prey or manipulating objects.|$|E
25|$|The {{skull of}} E. annectens {{is known for}} its long, wide muzzle. Cope {{compared}} this feature to that of a goose in side view, and to a short-billed spoonbill in top view. The skull was longer and lower proportionally than in any other known hadrosaurid. The toothless portion of the anterior mandible was relatively longer than in any hadrosaur. The <b>extreme</b> <b>length</b> and breadth did not appear until an individual reached maturity, so many specimens lack the distinctive shape. The bones surrounding the large openings for the nostrils formed deep pockets around the openings. The eye sockets were rectangular and longer front to back than top to bottom, although this may have been exaggerated by postmortem crushing. The skull roof was flat and lacked a bony crest, and the quadrate bone that formed the articulation with the lower jaw was distinctly curved. The lower jaw was long and straight, lacking the downward curve seen in other hadrosaurids, and possessing a heavy ridge running its length. The predentary was wide and shovel-like. The ridge on the lower jaw may have reinforced the long, slender structure.|$|E
500|$|Upon the single's release, Derek Johnson of the NME wrote: [...] "The {{intriguing}} {{features of}} 'Hey Jude' are its <b>extreme</b> <b>length</b> and the 40-piece orchestral accompaniment – and personally I {{would have preferred}} it without either!" [...] While he viewed the track overall as [...] "a beautiful, compelling song", and the first three minutes as [...] "absolutely sensational", Johnson rued the long coda's [...] "vocal improvisations on the basically repetitive four-bar chorus". Time magazine described the coda as [...] "a fadeout that engagingly spoofs the fadeout as a gimmick for ending pop records". The same reviewer contrasted [...] "Hey Jude" [...] with its B-side, [...] "Revolution", saying that [...] "The {{other side of the}} new disk urges activism of a different sort", due to McCartney [...] "liltingly exhort a friend to overcome his fears and commit himself in love". Rolling Stone also attributed the song's meaning as a message from McCartney to Lennon to end his negative relationships with women: [...] "to break the old pattern; to really go through with love". Other commentators interpreted [...] "Hey Jude" [...] as being directed at Bob Dylan, then semi-retired in Woodstock.|$|E

500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, repetition was {{a natural}} part of Tchaikovsky's music, just as it {{is an integral part of}} Russian music. His use of sequences within melodies (repeating a tune at a higher or lower pitch in the same voice) could go on for <b>extreme</b> <b>length.</b> The problem with repetition is that, over a period of time, the melody being repeated remains static, even when there is a surface level of rhythmic activity added to it. Tchaikovsky kept the musical conversation flowing by treating melody, tonality, rhythm and sound color as one integrated unit, rather than as separate elements. By making subtle but noticeable changes in the rhythm or phrasing of a tune, modulating to another key, changing the melody itself or varying the instruments playing it, Tchaikovsky could keep a listener's interest from flagging. By extending the number of repetitions, he could increase the musical and dramatic tension of a passage, building [...] "into an emotional experience of almost unbearable intensity," [...] as Brown phrases it, controlling when the peak and release of that tension would take place. Musicologist Martin Cooper calls this practice a subtle form of unifying a piece of music and adds that Tchaikovsky brought it to a high point of refinement. (For more on this practice, see the next section.) ...|$|E
500|$|In 963 or 964 Germanus was {{recalled}} to England by Oswald, who {{had recently}} founded a small monastic priory at Westbury-on-Trym. Germanus was named prior of that community and helped with teaching the novice monks. He was also prior of Ramsey Abbey, or perhaps dean, before becoming abbot of Winchcombe Abbey in about 970. Ramsey was founded by moving the monks of Westbury to Ramsey, but Germanus was not named abbot of Ramsey when this move was completed, being named abbot of Winchcombe instead. The reasons for this transfer are unrecorded. He was the first abbot of Winchcombe, but was removed from office in 975, {{as a result of}} political instability following the death of King Edgar of England in 975, when the monks at Winchcombe were exiled to Ramsey. The Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis [...] states that he became abbot of Cholsey Abbey in 992, and the Vita Oswaldi concurs with this statement. The Vita relates that when Oswald and the lay patron of Ramsey were near to death in 992 they urged the monks to elect Germanus as the next abbot of Ramsey when that office might become vacant. Instead, the monks elected another monk, and the Vita states that King Æthelred II of England appointed Germanus to Cholsey instead. Some historians have challenged Germanus' appointment to Cholsey, owing to the <b>extreme</b> <b>length</b> of ecclesiastical career this would necessitate.|$|E
500|$|Gracey {{refers to}} the film's {{cinematography}} as [...] "nothing short of astounding", and cites a particular example as highlighting Argento's [...] "passion for technical prowess and breathtaking visuals". Influenced by the penultimate shot in Antonioni's The Passenger (1975), on which Tovoli had also been the cinematographer, one of Tenebraes main setpieces is {{the murder of the}} lesbian couple. To introduce the scene, Argento and Tovoli employed the use of a Louma crane to film a several minutes-long tracking shot. Owing to its <b>extreme</b> <b>length,</b> the tracking shot ended up being the most difficult and complex part of the production to complete. It required a maze of scaffolding to be built around the outside of the home. Argento captured all the footage he needed in two takes, but insisted on filming ten more. The scene, which lasts for two-and-a-half minutes on-screen, took three days to shoot. It marked the first time the Louma crane had been used in an Italian production; the crane itself had to be imported from France. According to Gracey, the camera performs [...] "aerial gymnastics", scaling the victims' house in [...] "one seamless take, navigating walls, roofs, and peering in through windows, in a set piece that effortlessly exposes the penetrability of a seemingly secure home". Newman and Jones said that although this type of crane shot became commonplace later, {{at the time it was}} [...] "truly ground-breaking" [...] in the way the camera seemingly crawled over the walls and up the building – not quite from the killer's viewpoint. Patrick McAllister of Scifilm said the sequence should be considered [...] "one of the most memorable moments in cinema". According to McAllister, Tenebraes distributor begged Argento to cut the shot down because it was [...] "meaningless". Newman and Jones agreed that the shot added nothing to the film's plot, but called it [...] "meaninglessly brilliant".|$|E
