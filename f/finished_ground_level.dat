5000|$|Sougdouris {{was born}} in Ioannina, northwestern Greece, where he <b>finished</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> studies. He {{continued}} his studies at the University of Venice and in Padua where he may have attended courses at the local university. In 1681 Sougdouris became a priest {{and two years later}} the head of the [...] in Ioannina (a.k.a. Gioumeios or Gioumas School), succeeding Bessarion Makris. Sougdouris taught there natural science, mathematics and aristotelian philosophy. Sougdouris taught at the Goumas school until 1710 and was succeeded by Methodios Anthrakites. He wrote a number of philological, theological and philosophical works like Εισαγωγή Λογική (Introduction to Logic), published in Vienna, 1792 and Επιτομή Γραμματικής (Concise Grammar), both were extensively used as school textbooks. Moreover, he translated to Greek the work of Francesco Panigarola Rhetorica Ecclesiastica.|$|E

After <b>finishing</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> studies at his home village he moved to Corfu, Greece. Latter he attended the dentist school of the University of Athens, where he graduated at 1935.|$|R
50|$|Photiadis {{was born}} in Ioannina (Epirus), northwestern Greece, when the region was under Ottoman rule. After <b>finishing</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> studies in his home town he went to Bucharest. There {{he was a member}} of the court of the local lord, Alexander Mourousis. Moreover, he became a teacher at the Princely Academy of Bucharest, a notable {{educational}} institution focused on Greek language and culture. In 1792 he was appointed director of the institution, position he kept for 13 years, until his death in 1805. During this period the Academy reached its peak of popularity. During the same period Photiadis held the office of the inspector of the Greek schools of Wallachia.|$|R
50|$|Bamichas {{was born}} in Delvina, modern {{southern}} Albania (Northern Epirus), then Ottoman Empire. After <b>finishing</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> studies in his home town, he went to Geneva, where he studied law. Back to Delvina, {{he was involved in}} various patriotic initiatives and in 1914 he had to move to nearby Corfu, Greece. However, at the same year he returned and participated in the struggle for the establishment of the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus. In the 1915 elections, while Northern Epirus was under temporary Greek control, he was elected {{as a member of the}} Greek Parliament. During this period he cooperated closely with the later anti-Venizelist Ion Dragoumis. In 1919 he went to the Paris Peace Conference as part of the Northern Epirote delegation under Alexandros Karapanos. Bamichas lived the rest of his life in Corfu.|$|R
50|$|All {{membranes}} are porous to {{a limited}} extent so that, over time, low volumes of leachate will cross the membrane. The design of landfill membranes is at such low volumes that they should never have a measurable adverse impact {{on the quality of}} the receiving groundwater. A more significant risk may be the failure or abandonment of the leachate collection system. Such systems are prone to internal failure as landfills suffer large internal movements as waste decomposes unevenly and thus buckles and distorts pipes. If a leachate collection system fails, leachate levels will slowly build in a site and may even over-top the containing membrane and flow out into the environment. Rising leachate levels can also wet waste masses that have previously been dry, triggering further active decomposition and leachate generation. Thus, what appears to be a stabilised and inactive site can become re-activated and restart significant gas production and exhibit significant changes in <b>finished</b> <b>ground</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Georgios Sinas {{was born}} in Moschopolis of Greek [...] Aromanian origin, to Northern Epirote parents. At an early age Sinas lost his mother and was raised by his aunt in Serres (modern Greece), where he lived his first school years. About 1790 he moved with his father, the tobacco and cotton {{merchant}} Georgios Sinas the Elder (1753-1822), to the Habsburg residence Vienna, where he <b>finished</b> his <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> studies. At the age of 20, he became involved with his father's businesses and managed to take initiatives and successfully expanded the family business.|$|R

5000|$|The {{plant was}} {{designed}} by Albert Kahn as a Model T assembly plant, and built in 1916. Its design represents {{an important step in}} the development of Ford's assembly process. Previously, each step in the assembly of an automobile had taken place in a different building, which entailed a cost in time and labor to move the product from one building to another. From 1903 to 1916, Kahn designed [...] "all-under-one-roof" [...] buildings for a variety of manufacturers. In such buildings, Ford's usual practice was to begin assembly on the top floor and move downward until the product was <b>finished</b> at <b>ground</b> <b>level.</b> The Omaha plant was an exception to this: assembly began on the lowest floor and moved upward. It is speculated that the roof was used for storage of finished automobiles.|$|R

40|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>level</b> ozone is a {{secondary}} pollutant resulting from photochemical reaction {{of a variety}} of natural and anthropogenic precursor mainly volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Under favourable meteorological conditions, ozone may accumulate in the atmosphere and reach a high concentration level that can impose adverse effects on human health and ecosystem. The overall objective of the study is to evaluate the <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> ozone time series concentrations for three years period (From 18 th June 2009 to 6 th June 2011) in Rwanda with focus on Kigali city as it has an increasing number of vehicles and many industries which are the major potential sources of <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> ozone sources in Kigali City.  We have gathered the data from the database air monitoring machine about the <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> ozone concentration located in Kigali at the college of science and technology of University of Rwanda laboratory and the weather information from Rwanda Meteorological Services were used to for the discussion of the ozone data. The study shows that the weather patterns {{play an important role in}} establishing conditions conducive to the <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> ozone formation and accumulation. The air of Kigali city becomes more polluted during the dry season and the concentration of the <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> ozone increases with the temperature. Comparing the <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> ozone concentration in different season, the results showed that the concentration of <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> ozone was higher in dry season than in the rainy season.
