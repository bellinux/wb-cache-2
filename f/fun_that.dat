25|$|In 1996 a new company, Freedom Lite of Walton, Ontario reintroduced the Beaver RX 650, first {{displaying}} it at Sun 'n <b>Fun</b> <b>that</b> year. The improved RX 650 incorporated 186 {{changes over}} the previous RX 650 design and the company renamed it the Freedom Lite SS-11 Skywatch. The wings use conventional aircraft fabric instead of Dacron, giving build times of about 250 hours. The company placed the aircraft in the Canadian AULA category. Freedom Lite soon {{went out of business}} and the design was acquired by Legend Lite of New Hamburg, Ontario. This new company also closed its doors in the early 2000s.|$|E
25|$|By using tape, I {{could do}} a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit {{it down to the}} twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or {{situations}} that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the <b>fun</b> <b>that</b> sounded amusing.|$|E

In 2003, he appeared as Bernard in {{a run of}} David Mamet's play Sexual Perversity in Chicago, along with Matthew Perry and Minnie Driver, in London's West End. Azaria made his first appearance as Sir Lancelot, the French Taunter, and four other characters in Spamalot, the musical version of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which opened in Chicago in December 2004, {{before moving to the}} Shubert Theatre on Broadway. The show met with critical acclaim, receiving fourteen Tony Award nominations in 2005, with Azaria being nominated for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical. Reuniting with The Birdcage director Mike Nichols, and being a huge Monty Python fan, he saw it as an opportunity he could not pass up, describing it as [...] "so much <b>fun</b> <b>that</b> I haven't realized how tiring it is", and [...] "the most <b>fun</b> <b>that</b> I've ever had in my entire life". He took a break from the show in June 2005, with Alan Tudyk filling in for him, to work on Huff, but returned in December 2005. In late 2007 he starred in Aaron Sorkin's The Farnsworth Invention, playing RCA head David Sarnoff.

O'Hara went on to argue that both characters [...] "get decent character development too, and base their growing love story on more than a single longing glance". Todd Hertz of Christianity Today observed that [...] "Disney changed the film's title and showcased the swashbuckling Aladdin-meets-Robin-Hood character who replaces the original story's prince", but felt that [...] "Luckily, these marketing moves don't compromise Tangleds phenomenal storytelling or considerable charm. Hertz concluded, [...] "Still, the movie wisely takes a page from Pixar's playbook to fill the movie with so much well-done slapstick humor, action, goofy characters, and genuine <b>fun</b> <b>that</b> boys won't feel like the ads gave them the old bait-and-switch to trick them into a 'girl' movie." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{evaluated}} positively after its release. Internet reviewer James Berardinelli wrote {{that while the}} film did not reach the heights of Raiders of the Lost Ark, it [...] " [...] the lows of The Temple of Doom. A fitting end to the original trilogy, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade captures some {{of the sense of}} <b>fun</b> <b>that</b> infused the first movie while using the addition of Sean Connery to up the comedic ante and provide a father/son dynamic." [...] Neil Smith of the BBC praised the action, but said the drama and comedy between the Joneses was more memorable. He noted, [...] "The emphasis on the Jones boys means Julian Glover's venal villain and Alison Doody's treacherous beauty are sidelined, while the climax [...] one booby-trapped tomb too many."

[...] He also found the [...] "Vogue" [...] sample [...] "a rare case of Madonna acknowledging her own legacy." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that the song is [...] "a welcome bit of percolating electronica". Cinquemani commended {{the inclusion of the}} word [...] "genuflect" [...] in a pop song, but also felt that [...] "Madonna's Catholic baiting [...] like a reflex at this point". The reviewer believed that Madonna deliberately included provocative lyrics in the song, either to bring back her persona Dita Parlo from her 1992 studio album Erotica, or just to make a statement [...] "about women of a certain age unapologetically flexing their libidos".|$|E

[...] Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post said, [...] "It's simple but full of adventure, interesting characters and locations and a sense of <b>fun</b> <b>that</b> definitely makes it work in a very good way" [...] and has [...] "a solid visual design."
