40|$|Photo-induced {{structural}} {{transformation of}} C 60 single crystal {{and its compounds}} has been investigated under high pressure up to around 30 GPa by means of optical measurements. Formation of three-dimensional C 60 network structure was achieved by the photo-irradiation to C 60 single crystals under high pressure. Iodine doping worked as a structural template of the photo-dimerization because C 60 dimmers were selectively fabricated irrespective of magnitude of the pressure applied during photo-irradiation. Alkali metal doping completely suppressed the structural change of C 60 molecules. Electronic and vibrational properties of C 60 products which were photo-irradiated under pressure showed that structural transformation of C 60 single crystals significantly depended on the pressure applied during the photo-irradiation. The dependences {{can be interpreted as}} imprints of contracted structures under pressure due to formation of intermolecular bonds whose number is continuously increased with the applied pressure. The number of intermolecular bond has been estimated by comparative analyses using high pressure optical properties of the C 60 photopolymer which was photo-irradiated at ambient pressure. The analyses reveal that the number of the intermolecular bond increases up to about 5 with the applied pressure to 25 GPa. The activation energy of the photo-transformation at 3 GPa has been estimated to be 0. 23 eV which is equivalent to the activation energy of the photo-polymerization at ambient pressure. Therefore, the <b>interlinking</b> <b>mechanism</b> can be considered to be a [2 + 2] cycloadditional scheme similar to the photo-polymerization at ambient pressure. The three-dimensional structure of the polymerized phase originates from the inherent randomness of the photo-polymerization of C 60 molecules. Iodine doping effects on the photo-induced structural transformation have been investigated by Raman spectroscopy for iodine doped C 60 compounds crystallized into FCC and hexagonal structures. The photo-irradiation to the two samples yielded only C 60 dimmers irrespective of the applied pressure. The decomposition of the polyiodine molecules that exist in C 60 lattice has close relationship with the dimerization of C 60 molecules. Alkali metal doping effects have also been investigated with A 3 C 60 and A 6 C 60 compounds, where A denotes potassium and rubidium. In spite of some hopeful precedents, structural transformation of C 60 was completely suppressed by alkali metal doping even though the AxC 60 was subjected to the photo-irradiation at high pressures and high temperatures.

We focused on controlling independently three “demographic ” characteristics of gene expression: the mean, {{the noise and}} the non-genetic memory. We developed two chromosomally integrated synthetic gene circuits in yeast that conferred drastically different non-genetic memory to two cell populations while their means and noises remained comparable. Using these gene constructs {{we found that the}} genomic sequence and the environment jointly control population-level aspects of gene expression through two <b>interlinked</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> operating at different scales...|$|R

The linear correlation coefficients between the 5 -year averages of rainfall over NEB and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the Atlantic Ocean show a dipole configuration over the Tropical Atlantic. It is found that evaporation is higher over the Tropical North Atlantic, and lower over the Tropical South Atlantic during the 5 -year period of higher rainfall over NEB. Higher evaporation causes lower SST and vice versa. This {{seems to be}} the main mechanism which generates dipole configuration in the Atlantic SST. During the rainy season (February through May) in NEB moisture is transported towards NEB and converges, providing the necessary moisture source for the rainfall. This low level convergence is associated with the rising branch of a local meridional circulation cell, which in turn is generated by the SST dipole.

Ideally a vaccine would enable the development of anti-plasmodial antibodies in addition to generating an elevated cell-mediated response.

They exert their effect by activating the complement cascade, stimulating phagocytic cells into endocytosis through adhesion to an external surface of the antigenic substances, thus ‘marking’ it as offensive. Humoral or cell-mediated immunity consists of many <b>interlinking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that essentially aim to prevent infection entering the body (through external barriers or hostile internal environments) and then kill any micro-organisms or foreign particles that succeed in penetration. The cell-mediated component consists of many white blood cells (such as monocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, basophils, mast cells, natural killer cells, and eosinophils) that target foreign bodies by a variety of different mechanisms. In the case of malaria both systems would be targeted to attempt to increase the potential response generated, thus ensuring the maximum chance of preventing disease.|$|R
40|$|Many species exhibit two {{discrete}} male morphs: {{fighters and}} sneakers. Fighters {{are large and}} possess weapons but may mature slowly. Sneakers are small and have no weapons but can sneak matings and may mature quickly to start mating earlier in life than fighters. However, how differences in competitive ability and life history interact to determine male morph coexistence {{has not yet been}} investigated within a single framework. Here we integrate demography and game theory into a two-sex population model to study the evolution of strategies that result in the coexistence of fighters and sneakers. We incorporate differences in maturation time between the morphs and use a mating-probability matrix analogous to the classic hawk-dove game. Using adaptive dynamics, we show that male dimorphism evolves more easily in our model than in classic game theory approaches. Our results also revealed an interaction between life-history differences and sneaker competitiveness, which shows that demography and competitive games should be treated as <b>interlinked</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to understand the evolution of male dimorphism. Applying our approach to empirical data on bulb mites (Rhizoglyphus robini), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and bullhorned dung beetles (Onthophagus taurus) indicates that observed occurrences of male dimorphism are in general agreement with model predictions...|$|R

Developing a comprehensive understanding of host response to drought requires a global view of the complex mechanisms involved. Research on drought tolerance has generally been conducted using discipline-specific approaches. However, plant stress response is complex and interlinked {{to a point where}} discipline-specific approaches do not give a complete global analysis of all the <b>interlinked</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Systems biology perspective is needed to understand genome-scale networks required for building long-lasting drought resistance. Network maps have been constructed by integrating multiple functional genomics data with both model plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Lotus japonicus, and Medicago truncatula, and various food crops, such as rice and soybean. Useful functional genomics data have been obtained from genome-wide comparative transcriptome and proteome analyses of drought responses from different crops. This integrative approach used by many groups has led to identification of commonly regulated signaling pathways and genes following exposure to drought. Combination of functional genomics and systems biology is very useful for comparative analysis of other food crops and has the ability to develop stable food systems worldwide. In addition, studying desiccation tolerance in resurrection plants will unravel how combination of molecular genetic and metabolic processes interacts to produce a resurrection phenotype. Systems biology-based approaches have helped in understanding how these individual factors and mechanisms (biochemical, molecular, and metabolic) "interact" spatially and temporally.

In mammals, this process {{is driven by the}} suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the hypothalamus, composed of the two negative feedback loops Per-Cry and Clock-Bmal. Transcription of the period (Per) and cryptochrome (Cry) genes cannot proceed until CLOCK and BMAL1 have dimerized and bound to the E-box element, a process initiated by CREB-binding protein (CPB). Once bound to the E-box elements of per and cry, successful production of mRNA transcripts occurs and the proteins PER and CRY are synthesized. PER and CRY then dimerize and repress the transcription of the gene Rev-Erb, the protein product of which, REV-ERB, represses transcription of Bmal. The repression of BMAL in vivo prevents the transactivation of Per-Cry, thereby completing the cycle in just over 24 hours.|$|R

However {{it has long been}} noted that zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) requires maintenance of apical ectodermal ridge (AER). The dependence of ZPA on ARE indicates the linkage between them. Three phases have been observed during the interplay between ARE and ZPA. Initiaion phase involves the Grem1 expression in a fast initiator loop (~2h loop time) due to upregulation by BMP4. The Shh signalling is activated independently of GREM1 and AER-FGFs. Propagation phase involves the control of distal progression during limb bud development.

40|$|The {{transitions}} between {{phases of}} the cell cycle have evolved to be robust and switch-like, which ensures temporal separation of DNA replication, sister chromatid separation, and cell division. Mathematical models describing the biochemical interaction networks of cell cycle regulators attribute these properties to underlying bistable switches, which inherently generate robust, switch-like, and irreversible transitions between states. We have recently presented new mathematical models for two control systems that regulate crucial transitions in the cell cycle: mitotic entry and exit, 1 and the mitotic checkpoint. 2 Each of the two control systems is characterized by two interlinked bistable switches. In the case of mitotic checkpoint control these switches are mutually activating, whereas {{in the case of}} the mitotic entry/exit network the switches are mutually inhibiting. In this Perspective we describe the qualitative features of these regulatory motifs and show that having two <b>interlinked</b> bistable <b>mechanisms</b> further enhances robustness and irreversibility. We speculate that these network motifs also underlie other cell cycle transitions and cellular transitions between distinct biochemical states...|$|R

In this report, the Secretary-General promoted an understanding of transitional justice that comprises interlinked judicial and nonjudicial mechanisms, a framework in which truth commissions and courts interact. He reiterated the importance of victim-centred approaches to transitional justice, a topic that has received increased attention within the United Nations` human rights bodies. From 1999 onwards, the United Nations, through its Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), created a so far unique and unprecedented transitional justice model: a special, internationalised/hybrid court (Serious Crimes Regime) and a truth commission (Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation) to address the legacy of Timor-Leste`s violent past. What was unique and unprecedented about this model was the <b>interlinking</b> referral <b>mechanism</b> between the court and the truth commission.

40|$|Adolescent {{girls with}} a history of {{premature}} pubarche have an increased incidence of functional ovarian hyperandrogenism [a form of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) ] at adolescence, which is usually associated with hyperinsulinemia and dyslipemia. The hyperinsulinemia and lipid disturbances can often be detected in the prepubertal period and throughout puberty, and are associated with an exaggerated ovarian androgen synthesis. Birthweight SD scores are lower in premature pubarche girls than in control girls, and particularly so in those girls who show hyperinsulinemia and subsequently develop ovarian hyperandrogenism. Therefore, although the <b>mechanisms</b> <b>interlinking</b> the triad of premature pubarche, hyperinsulinism and ovarian hyperandrogenism remain enigmatic, these data indicate that the triad may result, at least in part, from a common early origin, rather than from a direct interrelationship later in life.

40|$|Obesity is an {{important}} risk factor for breast cancer (BC) in postmenopausal women; <b>interlinked</b> molecular <b>mechanisms</b> might {{be involved in the}} pathogenesis. Increased levels of estrogens due to aromatization of the adipose tissue, inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin- 6, and prostaglandin E 2, insulin resistance and hyperactivation of insulin-like growth factors pathways, adipokines, and oxidative stress are all abnormally regulated in obese women and contribute to cancerogenesis. These molecular factors interfere with intracellular signaling in the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatydilinositol- 3 -phosphate/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, which regulate the progression of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and protein synthesis. In this context, structural defects of typical genes related to both BC and obesity, such as leptin, leptin receptor, serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1, the fat mass and obesity-associated gene and melanocortin receptor 4, have been associated with a high or low risk of BC development. The early detection of these gene alterations might be useful as risk predictors in obese women, and targeting these pathways involved in the BC pathogenesis in obese women is a potential therapeutic tool. In particular, mTOR pathway deregulation concurs in both obesity and BC, and inhibition of this might disrupt the molecular interlinks in a similar manner to that of metformin, which exerts definite anticancer activity and is currently used as an antidiabetic drug with a weight-reducing property. The identification of both genetic and pharmacological implications on the prevention and management of BC is the ultimate aim of these studies...|$|R
40|$|The abrupt and {{irreversible}} {{transition from}} interphase to M phase {{is essential to}} separate DNA replication from chromosome segregation. This transition requires the switch-like phosphorylation of hundreds of proteins by the cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk 1) :cyclin B (CycB) complex. Previous studies have ascribed these switch-like phosphorylations to the auto-activation of Cdk 1 :CycB through the removal of inhibitory phosphorylations on Cdk 1 -Tyr 15 [1, 2]. The positive feedback in Cdk 1 activation creates a bistable switch that makes mitotic commitment irreversible [2 - 4]. Here, we surprisingly find that Cdk 1 auto-activation is dispensable for irreversible, switch-like mitotic entry due to a second mechanism, whereby Cdk 1 :CycB inhibits its counteracting phosphatase (PP 2 A:B 55). We show that the PP 2 A:B 55 -inhibiting Greatwall (Gwl) -endosulfine (ENSA) pathway is both necessary and sufficient for switch-like phosphorylations of mitotic substrates. Using purified components of the Gwl-ENSA pathway in a reconstituted system, we found a sharp Cdk 1 threshold for phosphorylation of a luminescent mitotic substrate. The Cdk 1 threshold to induce mitotic phosphorylation is distinctly higher than the Cdk 1 threshold required to maintain these phosphorylations-evidence for bistability. A combination of mathematical modeling and biochemical reconstitution show that the bistable behavior of the Gwl-ENSA pathway emerges from its mutual antagonism with PP 2 A:B 55. Our results demonstrate that two <b>interlinked</b> bistable <b>mechanisms</b> provide a robust solution for irreversible and switch-like mitotic entry...|$|R

However, there are only scant data about the precise pathogenetic <b>mechanisms</b> <b>interlinking</b> ND and BP {{as well as the}} immunologic profile in these patients. The aim is to analyze the serological immunopathological profiles (anti-BP 180 IgG, anti-BP 230 IgG) in BP patients with and without ND in order to identify the specific autoantibody(ies) and corresponding antigens responsible for ND development in BP patients. Altogether, 82 ethnic Poles with BP and their medical records were examined (62 BP-ND; 20 BP+ND). Levels of serum anti-BP 180 /BP 230 IgG in BP patients were evaluated with ELISAs. The statistical analyses involved Pearson chi-squared test, Mann-Whitney U-test and ranking of autoantibodies. The prevalence of ND among BP patients was 24. 4 %. There were no statistically significant differences in autoantigens profiles (anti-BP 180 /anti-BP 230 IgG) between BP+ND and BP-ND groups. There was no relationship between ND development and anti-BP 180 /anti-BP 230 IgG level (p = 0. 5933, p = 0. 4701, respectively). The autoantibodies levels of BP+ND and BP-ND patients show insignificant differences suggesting that also in ethnic Poles a hypothetical pathogenetic association of BP and ND, but not only an aging-related epidemiological one, appears to be independent of a particular BP antigen. Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that phenomena of epitopes spreading, immune cross-reaction and conformational changes in BP 180 /BP 230 may underlie BP development in ND patients...|$|R
40|$|Functional ovarian hyperandrogenism, a Variant of polycystic ovary syndrome, {{is often}} {{associated}} with hyperinsulinism and dyslipidemia. The <b>mechanisms</b> <b>interlinking</b> this triad are poorly understood; both hyperandrogenism and hyperinsulinism have been proposed as factors involved in the pathogenesis of the dyslipidemia. Precocious pubarche (PP) in girls is a risk factor for subsequent anovulation, ovarian and adrenal, hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinism and dyslipidemia. Flutamide, a nonsteroidal antiandrogen, is known to be effective in reducing hirsutism in patients with ovarian hyperandrogenism. However, the effects of flutamide on the endocrine-metabolic correlates of hyperandrogenism are uncertain. We assessed the effects of low dose flutamide treatment (250 mg daily for 18 months) on hormonal and metabolic variables in 18 nonobese adolescent girls (age, 16. 8 +/- 0. 3 yr) with functional ovarian hyperandrogenism (diagnosis by GnRH agonist test) after PP. Flutamide treatment was accompanied by a marked decrease in the hirsutism score, free androgen index, and testosterone, andro-stenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone levels and by an increase in sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations. However, there were no substantial changes in the pattern of menstrual cycles, gonadotropin, estradiol, or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate concentrations, and there was no detectable effect on the 17 -hydroxyprogesterone response to GnRH agonist. Serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased markedly during flutamide therapy, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glycemia/insulinemia, and the insulin response to a glucose load remained unchanged. Flutamide was well tolerated. In conclusion, low dose flutamide treatment was found to be an effective and safe approach to reduce hirsutism and circulating androgen, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in girls with functional ovarian hyperandrogenism after PP. However, flutamide failed to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels or decrease hyperinsulinemia, i. e. to affect two major risk factors for subsequent cardiovascular disease. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from Cochrane Collaboration via the DOI in this record. BACKGROUND: There is growing {{research}} and policy interest in the potential for using the natural environment to enhance human health and well-being. This resource may be underused as a health promotion tool to address the increasing burden of common health problems such as increased chronic diseases and mental health concerns. Outdoor environmental enhancement and conservation activities (EECA) (for instance unpaid litter picking, tree planting or path maintenance) offer opportunities for physical activity alongside greater connectedness with local environments, enhanced social connections within communities and improved self-esteem through activities that improve the locality which may, in turn, further improve well-being. OBJECTIVES: To assess the health and well-being impacts on adults following participation in environmental enhancement and conservation activities. SEARCH METHODS: We contacted or searched the websites of more than 250 EECA organisations to identify grey literature. Resource limitations meant the majority of the websites were from UK, USA, Canada and Australia. We searched the following databases (initially in October 2012, updated October 2014, except CAB Direct, OpenGrey, SPORTDiscus, and TRIP Database), using a search strategy developed with our project advisory groups (predominantly leaders of EECA-type activities and methodological experts) : ASSIA; BIOSIS; British Education Index; British Nursing Index; CAB Abstracts; Campbell Collaboration; Cochrane Public Health Specialized Register; DOPHER; EMBASE; ERIC; Global Health; GreenFILE; HMIC; MEDLINE-in-Process; MEDLINE; OpenGrey; PsychINFO; Social Policy and Practice; SPORTDiscus; TRoPHI; Social Services Abstracts; Sociological Abstracts; The Cochrane Library; TRIP database; and Web of Science. Citation and related article chasing was used. Searches were limited to studies in English published after 1990. SELECTION CRITERIA: Two review authors independently screened studies. Included studies examined the impact of EECA on adult health and well-being. Eligible interventions needed to include each of the following: intended to improve the outdoor natural or built environment at either a local or wider level; took place in urban or rural locations in any country; involved active participation; and were NOT experienced through paid employment. We included quantitative and qualitative research. Includable quantitative study designs were: randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, quasi-RCTs, cluster quasi-RCTs, controlled before-and-after studies, interrupted-time-series, cohort studies (prospective or retrospective), case-control studies and uncontrolled before-and-after studies (uBA). We included qualitative research if it used recognised qualitative methods of data collection and analysis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One reviewer extracted data, and another reviewer checked the data. Two review authors independently appraised study quality using the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool (for quantitative studies) or Wallace criteria (for qualitative studies). Heterogeneity of outcome measures and poor reporting of intervention specifics prevented meta-analysis so we synthesised the results narratively. We synthesised qualitative research findings using thematic analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Database searches identified 21, 420 records, with 21, 304 excluded at title/abstract. Grey literature searches identified 211 records. We screened 327 full-text articles from which we included 21 studies (reported in 28 publications) : two case-studies (which were not included in the synthesis due to inadequate robustness), one case-control, one retrospective cohort, five uBA, three mixed-method (uBA, qualitative), and nine qualitative studies. The 19 studies included in the synthesis detailed the impacts to a total of 3, 603 participants: 647 from quantitative intervention studies and 2630 from a retrospective cohort study; and 326 from qualitative studies (one not reporting sample size). Included studies shared the key elements of EECA defined above, but the range of activities varied considerably. Quantitative evaluation methods were heterogeneous. The designs or reporting of quantitative studies, or both, were rated as 'weak' quality with high risk of bias due to one or more of the following: inadequate study design, intervention detail, participant selection, outcome reporting and blinding. Participants' characteristics were poorly reported; eight studies did not report gender or age and none reported socio-economic status. Three quantitative studies reported that participants were referred through health or social services, or due to mental ill health (five quantitative studies), however participants' engagement routes were often not clear. Whilst the majority of quantitative studies (n = 8) reported no effect on one or more outcomes, positive effects were reported in six quantitative studies relating to short-term physiological, mental/emotional health, and quality-of-life outcomes. Negative effects were reported in two quantitative studies; one study reported higher levels of anxiety amongst participants, another reported increased mental health stress. The design or reporting, or both, of the qualitative studies was rated as good in three studies or poor in nine; mainly due to missing detail about participants, methods and interventions. Included qualitative evidence provided rich data about the experience of participation. Thematic analysis identified eight themes supported by at least one good quality study, regarding participants' positive experiences and related to personal/social identity, physical activity, developing knowledge, spirituality, benefits of place, personal achievement, psychological benefits and social contact. There was one report of negative experiences. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is little quantitative evidence of positive or negative health and well-being benefits from participating in EECA. However, the qualitative research showed high levels of perceived benefit among participants. Quantitative evidence resulted from study designs with high risk of bias, qualitative evidence lacked reporting detail. The majority of included studies were programme evaluations, conducted internally or funded by the provider. The conceptual framework illustrates the range of <b>interlinked</b> <b>mechanisms</b> through which people believe they potentially achieve health and well-being benefits, such as opportunities for social contact. It also considers potential moderators and mediators of effect. One main finding of the review is the inherent difficulty associated with generating robust evidence of effectiveness for complex interventions. We developed the conceptual framework to illustrate how people believed they benefited. Investigating such mechanisms in a subsequent theory-led review might be one way of examining evidence of effect for these activities. The conceptual framework needs further refinement through linked reviews and more reliable evidence. Future research should use more robust study designs and report key intervention and participant detail. This systematic review is funded by the NIHR School for Public Health Research (SPHR).

40|$|The In Vitro Production (IVP) of embryos is a {{standard}} method in animal husbandry mainly in cattle. Nevertheless, blastocyst rates do not rise above 40 % even in morphologically good quality oocytes. Crucial conditions for embryonal viability are established during meiotic maturation of the oocytes and early embryonic development. At the beginning of meiotic maturation the chromatin condensation inhibits the transcription almost completely. Nevertheless, we find an increasing amount of polyadenylated but rarely translated mRNA. In MII-oocytes the translation is strongly repressed. This results in accumulation of polyadenylated, but translational inactive mRNAs, which are available for specific activation to the early embryo before his own transcription starts. At this point regulation is only possible {{at the level of}} translation. The limiting step for protein synthesis and central regulation mechanism is the initiation of translation. Here, especially the translation initiation factors, other 5 ´- and 3 ´-interacting proteins and their controlling kinases are of importance. We want to proof that statespecific changes in abundance and phosphorylation of 5 ´ and 3 ´ binding proteins are responsible for the repression of translation in MII-oocytes and the reactivation in early embryos. In this work the most important factors were analysed with regard to their abundance and phosphorylation state during meiotic maturation and early embryonic development using bovine, in vitro derived oocytes and embryos. Used methods were SDS-PAGE, isoelectric focusing, Western Blot and immunoprecipitation. Analysis included as 5 ´- interacting factors the eIF 4 F-complex composed of the cap binding protein eIF 4 E, the scaffold protein eIF 4 G and the helicase eIF 4 A and additionally the translational repressor 4 E-BP 1. Moreover we analysed PABP 1 and 3, Paip 1 and 2, CPEB 1 and Maskin as 3 ´-interacting proteins and MAPK, Akt und Aurora A and B as controlling kinases. Based on the Closed Loop-Model by Mangus et al. (2003) it is possible to create the following, strongly simplified model of translation initiation: The cap binding protein eIF 4 E binds the cap structure at the 5 ´ end of the mRNA. Following its phosphorylation by Aurora A, the cytoplasmic polyadenylaton binding protein CPEB recruits CPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation specifity factor) that activates the poly(A) -polymerase (PAP), which elongates the poly(A) -tail. This gives the Poly(A) -Binding Protein PABP the possibility to bind. The formation of the eIF 4 F-complex with binding of eIF 4 G to eIF 4 E brings eIF 4 A into position to resolve secondary structures and allows the binding of the 43 S preinitiation complex. Only all of these protein interactions together stimulate the translation. This offers lots of different possibilities to repress translation. The hypophosphorylated 4 E-BP 1 at the 5 ´-end and the CPEB-Maskin-complex from the 3 ´-end can bind to eIF 4 E and in this way block the formation of the eIF 4 F-complex and the helicase activity. But especially at the oocyte to embryo transition very specific mechanisms are dominant. Our findings show that especially at the transition from MII-stage to two-cell-embryo the most striking differences in abundance and phosphorylation of the involved factors are to be found. Furthermore, major phosphorylation of specific target sequences of PKA, PKB, PKC, CDKs, ATM/ATR and MAPK was observed in MII stage oocytes. Closer examination of the different stadiums shows that in GV-stage the abundance of translational repressors 4 E-BP 1 and Paip 2 is strongly reduced and a new repressing factor takes their place, which was discovered and described for the first time during this research. Looking for a Maskin related factor using a Maskin antibody we found a 55 kDa protein, which is much smaller, but has eIF 4 E binding ability and possesses a coiled coil domain. Only a binding to CPEB could not be verified. However it was clearly shown that especially in GVstage the Maskin like protein blocks eIF 4 E-binding to the Cap and the formation of the eIF 4 Fcomplex. But during further meiotic maturation the Maskin like protein is phosphorylated and lots of it can be found in supernatant. So it can’t be the most responsible factor for translational repression in MII-oocytes. <b>Interlinking</b> of different <b>mechanisms</b> seems to be the real cause. The most important part is the degradation of CPEB in this stage. Due to this there is no activation of CPSF and Poly(A) - Polymerase, mRNAs do not become polyadenylated, the additionally reduced PABP is less likely to bind to the shortened Poly(A) tail. As a consequence it is not available for the closure of the mRNA ring. Missing PABP-binding and dephosphorylation of eIF 4 G strongly reduce its binding affinity to eIF 4 E, which becomes even more phosphorylated during maturation. Formation of the eIF 4 F-complex is inhibited, such as the activity of eIF 4 A. Consequently the ribosomal translation initiation complex can’t bind to the mRNA, therefore translation is repressed. In the early embryo until four cell stage the factors gradually return to a state, which facilitates translation of some early, not CPE-controlled mRNAs. Phosphorylation of eIF 4 G rises, that of eIF 4 E decreases to a middle level. Both simplify the formation of eIF 4 F. The repressor protein 4 E-BP 1 shows a middle phosphorylation state. So it is not active, but easily and promptly to activate. The maskin like protein {{can be found in a}} minor amount in early stages, its abundance rises slowly in eight and sixteen cell stage. At this time the expression of CPEB and PABP increases strongly. This causes reinitiation of translation of the big amount CPE-dependent mRNAs. In this work basic structures of translation regulation at the oocyte to embryo transition could be explained, but there are lots of questions remaining. Especially the role of Maskin like protein, regulatory mechanisms for the translation of early mRNAs and the different subtypes of late translated mRNAs need to be further investigated...|$|R
