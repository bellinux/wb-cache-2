5|$|Based on his <b>form</b> <b>for</b> the Services, Hassett was {{selected}} in the Australian team for a brief five-match tour of New Zealand in February and March 1946. As the military men played poorly in Australia, the national selectors concluded that their achievements against England must have been against weak opposition, and only Hassett and Miller were selected for the Australian tour of New Zealand.|$|E

A section of lock would be poured behind the form, {{and when it was}} set, the form would be moved to do the next section. Each of the twelve towers was 78 ft high by 36 ft wide. The <b>forms</b> <b>for</b> the culverts were made of steel and were collapsible so they could be removed and moved along after each section of culvert had set. In all, there were 33 <b>forms</b> <b>for</b> the centre and side-wall culverts, each 12 ft long, and 100 smaller <b>forms</b> <b>for</b> the lateral culverts.|$|R

5|$|According to Vrba, the impala {{evolved from}} an alcelaphine {{ancestor}}. She noted that while this ancestor has diverged at least 18 times into various morphologically different forms, the impala has continued in its basic <b>form</b> <b>for</b> {{at least five}} million years. Several fossil species have been discovered, including A. datoadeni from the Pliocene of Ethiopia. The oldest fossil discovered suggests its ancient ancestors were slightly smaller than the modern form, but otherwise similar in all aspects to the latter. This implies that the impala has efficiently adapted to its environment since prehistoric times. Its gregarious nature, variety in diet, positive population trend, defence against ticks and symbiotic relationship with the tick-feeding oxpeckers could {{have played a role}} in preventing major changes in morphology and behaviour.|$|E
