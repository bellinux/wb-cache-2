5|$|Basket {{cells in}} CA3 receive <b>excitatory</b> {{input from the}} {{pyramidal}} cells and then give an inhibitory feedback to the pyramidal cells. This recurrent inhibition is a simple feedback circuit that can dampen <b>excitatory</b> responses in the hippocampus. The pyramidal cells gives a recurrent excitation which is an important mechanism found in some memory processing microcircuits.|$|E
5|$|In epileptic {{seizures}} a {{group of}} neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized manner. This results {{in a wave of}} depolarization known as a paroxysmal depolarizing shift. Normally, after an <b>excitatory</b> neuron fires it becomes more resistant to firing for a period of time. This {{is due in part to}} the effect of inhibitory neurons, electrical changes within the <b>excitatory</b> neuron, and the negative effects of adenosine.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} ways in which {{epilepsy}} occurs. Examples of pathological physiology include: unusual <b>excitatory</b> connections within the neuronal network of the brain; abnormal neuron structure leading to altered current flow; decreased inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesis; ineffective receptors for inhibitory neurotransmitters; insufficient breakdown of <b>excitatory</b> neurotransmitters leading to excess; immature synapse development; and impaired function of ionic channels.|$|E
5|$|Many {{important}} proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic {{amino acids}} have biological functions. For example, {{in the human}} brain, glutamate (standard glutamic acid) and gamma-amino-butyric acid ("GABA", non-standard gamma-amino acid) are, respectively, the main <b>excitatory</b> and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Hydroxyproline, {{a major component of}} the connective tissue collagen, is synthesised from proline. Glycine is a biosynthetic precursor to porphyrins used in red blood cells. Carnitine is used in lipid transport.|$|E
5|$|Phosphorylation is a {{chemical}} reaction {{in which a}} small phosphate group is added to another molecule to change that molecule's activity. Autonomously active CaMKII and PKC use phosphorylation {{to carry out the}} two major mechanisms underlying the expression of E-LTP. First, and most importantly, they phosphorylate existing AMPA receptors to increase their activity. Second, they mediate or modulate the insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. Importantly, the delivery of AMPA receptors to the synapse during E-LTP is independent of protein synthesis. This is achieved by having a nonsynaptic pool of AMPA receptors adjacent to the postsynaptic membrane. When the appropriate LTP-inducing stimulus arrives, nonsynaptic AMPA receptors are rapidly trafficked into the postsynaptic membrane under the influence of protein kinases. As mentioned previously, AMPA receptors are the brain's most abundant glutamate receptors and mediate the majority of its <b>excitatory</b> activity. By increasing the efficiency and number of AMPA receptors at the synapse, future <b>excitatory</b> stimuli generate larger postsynaptic responses.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{original}} discovery in the rabbit hippocampus, LTP {{has been observed}} {{in a variety of}} other neural structures, including the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, amygdala, and many others. Robert Malenka, a prominent LTP researcher, has suggested that LTP may even occur at all <b>excitatory</b> synapses in the mammalian brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} {{composed}} {{of a network of}} neurons that transmit signals by propagating nerve impulses. The propagation of this impulse from one neuron to another is typically controlled by neurotransmitters, though there are also electrical pathways between some neurons. Neurotransmitters can inhibit impulse firing (primarily done by γ-aminobutyric acid, or GABA) or they can excite the neuron into firing (primarily done by glutamate). A neuron that releases inhibitory neurotransmitters from its terminals is called an inhibitory neuron, while one that releases <b>excitatory</b> neurotransmitters is an <b>excitatory</b> neuron. When the normal balance between inhibition and excitation is significantly disrupted in {{all or part of the}} brain, a seizure can occur. The GABA system is an important target for anticonvulsant drugs, since seizures may be discouraged by increasing GABA synthesis, decreasing its breakdown, or enhancing its effect on neurons.|$|E
5|$|Cerebellar granule cells, in {{contrast}} to Purkinje cells, are among the smallest neurons in the brain. They are also easily the most numerous neurons in the brain: In humans, estimates of their total number average around 50 billion, which means that about 3/4 of the brain's neurons are cerebellar granule cells. Their cell bodies are packed into a thick layer {{at the bottom of}} the cerebellar cortex. A granule cell emits only four to five dendrites, each of which ends in an enlargement called a dendritic claw. These enlargements are sites of <b>excitatory</b> input from mossy fibers and inhibitory input from Golgi cells.|$|E
5|$|The two neurotransmitters {{that are}} used most widely in the {{vertebrate}} brain are glutamate, which almost always exerts <b>excitatory</b> effects on target neurons, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is almost always inhibitory. Neurons using these transmitters {{can be found in}} nearly every part of the brain. Because of their ubiquity, drugs that act on glutamate or GABA tend to have broad and powerful effects. Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate; most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of GABA.|$|E
5|$|Mossy fibers {{enter the}} {{granular}} layer from their points of origin, many {{arising from the}} pontine nuclei, others from the spinal cord, vestibular nuclei etc. In the human cerebellum, {{the total number of}} mossy fibers has been estimated at about 200 million. These fibers form <b>excitatory</b> synapses with the granule cells and the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Within the granular layer, a mossy fiber generates a series of enlargements called rosettes. The contacts between mossy fibers and granule cell dendrites take place within structures called glomeruli. Each glomerulus has a mossy fiber rosette at its center, and up to 20 granule cell dendritic claws contacting it. Terminals from Golgi cells infiltrate the structure and make inhibitory synapses onto the granule cell dendrites. The entire assemblage is surrounded by a sheath of glial cells. Each mossy fiber sends collateral branches to several cerebellar folia, generating a total of 20–30 rosettes; thus a single mossy fiber makes contact with an estimated 400–600 granule cells.|$|E
5|$|Synapses {{are the key}} {{functional}} elements of the brain. The essential function of the brain is cell-to-cell communication, and synapses are the points at which communication occurs. The human brain has been estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses; even the brain of a fruit fly contains several million. The functions of these synapses are very diverse: some are <b>excitatory</b> (exciting the target cell); others are inhibitory; others work by activating second messenger systems that change the internal chemistry of their target cells in complex ways. A large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable; that is, {{they are capable of}} changing strength {{in a way that is}} controlled by the patterns of signals that pass through them. It is widely believed that activity-dependent modification of synapses is the brain's primary mechanism for learning and memory.|$|E
5|$|Tbr1, {{along with}} Pax6 and Tbr2, {{has a role}} in glutamatergic {{projection}} neuron differentiation. Glutamatergic neurons make and release in an activity-dependent manner the <b>excitatory</b> neurotransmitter glutamate {{as opposed to the}} inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. The transition from radial glial cells to postmitotic projection neurons occurs in three steps, each associated with one of the aforementioned transcription factors. The first starts out with the expression of Pax6 in radial glial cells found primarily at the ventricular surface. In the next step, Pax6 is downregulated and Tbr2 is expressed as the cell differentiates into an intermediate progenitor cell. Likewise, in the final step, Tbr2 is extremely downregulated to undetectable levels as Tbr1 signals the transition into a postmitotic projection neuron.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of neurons {{in the deep}} nuclei have large cell bodies and spherical dendritic trees with a radius of about 400μm, and use glutamate as their neurotransmitter. These cells project {{to a variety of}} targets outside the cerebellum. Intermixed with them are a lesser number of small cells, which use GABA as a neurotransmitter and project exclusively to the inferior olivary nucleus, the source of climbing fibers. Thus, the nucleo-olivary projection provides an inhibitory feedback to match the <b>excitatory</b> projection of climbing fibers to the nuclei. There is evidence that each small cluster of nuclear cells projects to the same cluster of olivary cells that send climbing fibers to it; there is strong and matching topography in both directions.|$|E
5|$|Topiramate, a {{derivative}} of the naturally occurring sugar monosaccharide D-fructose, {{has been found}} effective in helping alcoholics quit or {{cut back on the}} amount they drink. Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes <b>excitatory</b> glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. A 2008 review of the effectiveness of topiramate concluded that the results of published trials are promising, however, as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence. A 2010 review found that topiramate may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options. Topiramate effectively reduces craving and alcohol withdrawal severity as well as improving quality-of-life-ratings.|$|E
5|$|Brain {{activity}} {{is made possible}} by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets. A neuron consists of a cell body, axon, and dendrites. Dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons. The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an action potential (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal, to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another neuron. An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins. When an action potential, reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell. These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and glutamate is the major <b>excitatory</b> neurotransmitter. Neurons link at synapses to form pathways and elaborate neural networks, and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
5|$|The {{property}} that makes neurons unique is {{their ability to}} send signals to specific target cells over long distances. They send these signals {{by means of an}} axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a pyramidal cell, (an <b>excitatory</b> neuron) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than a kilometer. These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 meters per second. Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials.|$|E
25|$|Dendritic spines usually receive <b>excitatory</b> {{input from}} axons {{although}} sometimes both inhibitory and <b>excitatory</b> connections are made onto the same spine head.|$|E
25|$|Three neurotransmitters {{that play}} {{important}} roles in adolescent brain development are glutamate, dopamine and serotonin. Glutamate is an <b>excitatory</b> neurotransmitter. During the synaptic pruning that occurs during adolescence, most of the neural connections that are pruned contain receptors for glutamate or other <b>excitatory</b> neurotransmitters. Because of this, by early adulthood the synaptic balance in the brain is more inhibitory than <b>excitatory.</b>|$|E
25|$|Counterintuitively, KCC2 {{has also}} been shown to colocalize at <b>excitatory</b> synapses. One {{suggested}} explanation for such colocalization is a potential protective role of KCC2 against excitotoxicity. Ion influx due to the <b>excitatory</b> synaptic stimulation of ion channels in the neuronal membrane causes osmotic swelling of cells as water is drawn in alongside the ions. KCC2 may help to eliminate excess ions from the cell in order to re-establish osmotic homeostasis.|$|E
25|$|The {{subthalamic nucleus}} is a diencephalic gray matter {{portion of the}} basal ganglia, and the only portion of the ganglia that {{produces}} an <b>excitatory</b> neurotransmitter, glutamate. The role of the subthalamic nucleus is to stimulate the SNr-GPi complex and {{it is part of}} the indirect pathway. The subthalamic nucleus receives inhibitory input from the external part of the globus pallidus and sends <b>excitatory</b> input to the GPi.|$|E

25|$|Ionotropic {{glutamate}} receptors {{can include}} NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptors. These receptors are named after agonists that facilitate glutamate activity. NMDA receptors are notable for their <b>excitatory</b> mechanisms to affect neuronal plasticity in learning and memory, {{as well as}} neuropathologies such as stroke and epilepsy. NDMA receptors have multiple binding sites just like ionotropic GABA receptors and can be influenced by co-agonists such the glycine neurotransmitter or phencyclidine (PCP). The NMDA receptors carry a current by Ca2+ ions and can be blocked by extracellular Mg2+ ions depending on voltage and membrane potential. This Ca2+ influx is increased by <b>excitatory</b> postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) produced by NMDA receptors, activating Ca2+-based signaling cascades (such as neurotransmitter release). AMPA generate shorter and larger <b>excitatory</b> postsynaptic currents than other ionotropic glutamate receptors.|$|E
25|$|The flow {{of urine}} through the urethra has an overall <b>excitatory</b> role in micturition, which helps sustain voiding until the bladder is empty.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{function}} of GHB {{in the body}} is not clear. It is known, however, that the brain expresses {{a large amount of}} receptors that are activated by GHB. These receptors are <b>excitatory</b> and not responsible for the sedative effects of GHB – they have been shown to elevate the principal <b>excitatory</b> neurotransmitter—glutamate. The benzamide antipsychotics—amisulpride, sulpiride—have been shown to bind to this receptor in vivo. Other antipsychotics were tested and were not found to have an affinity for this receptor.|$|E
25|$|Receptors on the {{opposite}} side of the synaptic gap bind neurotransmitter molecules. Receptors can respond in either of two general ways. First, the receptors may directly open ligand-gated ion channels in the postsynaptic cell membrane, causing ions to enter or exit the cell and changing the local transmembrane potential. The resulting change in voltage is called a postsynaptic potential. In general, the result is <b>excitatory</b> in the case of depolarizing currents, and inhibitory in the case of hyperpolarizing currents. Whether a synapse is <b>excitatory</b> or inhibitory depends on what type(s) of ion channel conduct the postsynaptic current(s), which in turn is a function of the type of receptors and neurotransmitter employed at the synapse. The second way a receptor can affect membrane potential is by modulating the production of chemical messengers inside the postsynaptic neuron. These second messengers can then amplify the inhibitory or <b>excitatory</b> response to neurotransmitters.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies have}} found that adults who stutter have {{elevated}} levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, and have thus found dopamine antagonists that reduce stuttering (see anti-stuttering medication below). Overactivity of the midbrain has been found {{at the level of the}} substantia nigra extended to the red nucleus and subthalamic nucleus, which all contribute to the production of dopamine. However, increased dopamine does not imply increased <b>excitatory</b> function since dopamine's effect can be both <b>excitatory</b> or inhibitory depending upon which dopamine receptors (labelled D1 – D5) have been stimulated.|$|E
25|$|In general, if an <b>excitatory</b> synapse {{is strong}} enough, an action {{potential}} in the presynaptic neuron will trigger an action {{potential in the}} postsynaptic cell. In many cases the <b>excitatory</b> postsynaptic potential (EPSP) will not reach the threshold for eliciting an action potential. When action potentials from multiple presynaptic neurons fire simultaneously, or if a single presynaptic neuron fires at a high enough frequency, the EPSPs can overlap and summate. If enough EPSPs overlap, the summated EPSP can reach the threshold for initiating an action potential. This process is known as summation, and {{can serve as a}} high pass filter for neurons.|$|E
25|$|This role {{may also}} {{account for the}} fact that KCC2 has been known to colocalize near <b>excitatory</b> synapses, even though its primary role is to {{establish}} the chloride gradient for postsynaptic inhibition.|$|E
25|$|The D2Lh form may {{function}} as a classical post-synaptic receptor, i.e., transmit information (in either an <b>excitatory</b> or an inhibitory fashion) unless blocked by a receptor antagonist or a synthetic partial agonist.|$|E
25|$|Nicotinic receptors {{bind the}} {{acetylcholine}} (ACh) neurotransmitter to produce non-selective cation channel flow that generates <b>excitatory</b> postsynaptic responses. Receptor activity, {{which can be}} influenced by nicotine consumption, produces feelings of euphoria, relaxation, and inevitably addiction in high levels.|$|E
25|$|Through its {{action on}} GABA receptors, {{phenobarbital}} increases flux of chloride ions into the neuron which decreases excitability. Direct blockade of <b>excitatory</b> glutamate signaling is also believed {{to contribute to}} the hypnotic/anticonvulsant effect that is observed with the barbiturates.|$|E
25|$|Under some circumstances, {{the normal}} order of motor unit {{recruitment}} may be altered, such that small motor units cease to fire and larger ones may be recruited. This {{is thought to}} be due to the interaction of <b>excitatory</b> and inhibitory motoneuronal inputs.|$|E
25|$|Glutamatergic neurons—glutamate. Glutamate {{is one of}} {{two primary}} <b>excitatory</b> amino acid neurotransmitter, the other being Aspartate. Glutamate receptors are one of four categories, three of which are ligand-gated ion {{channels}} and one of which is a G-protein coupled receptor (often referred to as GPCR).|$|E
25|$|The {{intestinal}} phase has two parts, the <b>excitatory</b> and the inhibitory. Partially digested food {{fills the}} duodenum. This triggers intestinal gastrin to be released. Enterogastric reflex inhibits vagal nuclei, activating sympathetic fibers causing the pyloric sphincter to tighten to prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{depression}} (LTD) {{and long-term}} potentiation (LTP) are {{two forms of}} long-term plasticity, lasting minutes or more, that occur at <b>excitatory</b> synapses. NMDA-dependent LTD and LTP have been extensively researched, and are found to require the binding of glutamate, and glycine or D-serine for activation of NMDA receptors.|$|E
25|$|Preparing fetal neurons for delivery: Crossing the placenta, {{maternal}} oxytocin {{reaches the}} fetal brain and induces a switch {{in the action}} of neurotransmitter GABA from <b>excitatory</b> to inhibitory on fetal cortical neurons.
