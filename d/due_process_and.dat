5|$|However, Bo's {{campaign}} {{was criticized for}} running roughshod over judicial <b>due</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> eroding the rule of law. Individuals targeted in the campaign were arbitrarily detained by the authorities, with an estimated 1,000 being sent to forced labor. Lawyers for the accused were intimidated and harassed, and {{in at least one}} case, sentenced to 18 months in prison. Allegations also surfaced over the use of torture to extract confessions. Moreover, assets seized during the campaign were allegedly redirected to help pay for Bo's popular social housing programs. The Wall Street Journal reported that $11 billion went into government coffers through the campaign. Li Jun, a fugitive businessman, asserted that he became a target of Bo anti-corruption drive {{as a result of a}} land dispute with the government. When he refused government demands to give up the land, he claims that he was abducted and tortured, and that $700 million worth of assets in his business were seized.|$|E
5|$|The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment {{applies only}} against the states, {{but it is}} {{otherwise}} textually identical to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which applies against the federal government; both clauses have been interpreted to encompass identical doctrines of procedural <b>due</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> substantive due process. Procedural due process is the guarantee of a fair legal process when the government tries to interfere with a person's protected interests in life, liberty, or property, and substantive due process is the guarantee that the fundamental rights of citizens will not be encroached on by government. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment also incorporates most of the provisions in the Bill of Rights, which were originally applied against only the federal government, and applies them against the states.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between <b>due</b> <b>process</b> rights <b>and</b> various school-related issues and functions as perceived by students. A review of literature indicated that students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of these issues and functions have tended to effect attitudes and behavior of students by alienating certain groups of students from the academic <b>and</b> social <b>processes.</b> This study utilized quantitative methods to determine the relationships between <b>due</b> <b>process</b> rights <b>and</b> school-related issues and functions (school climate, school policy, attitude toward authority figures, and classroom learning environment). Over 2000 questionnaires were given to ten moderators who were each responsible for one school site out offive middle schools and five high schools in the Dekalb County School System. One thousand seventy-eight questionnaires were returned correctly. In the study, suspension and expulsion data from the survey are presented as descriptive statistics to gain insight into the attitudes and behavior patterns of the survey participants. The dependent and independent variables were analyzed using the Pearson r correlation coefficient and the Partial Correlation statistical tools. The 0. 05 level of significance was used to test the null hypothesis. The following are the findings of this study: (I) There is a significant relationship between <b>due</b> <b>process</b> rights <b>and</b> school climate as perceived by students; (2) There is a significant relationship between <b>due</b> <b>process</b> rights <b>and</b> school policy as perceived by students; (3) There is a significant relationship between <b>due</b> <b>process</b> rights <b>and</b> students 2 ̆ 7 attitudes toward authority figures as perceived by students; (4) There is a significant relationship between <b>due</b> <b>process</b> rights <b>and</b> classroom learning environment as perceived by students; (5) There is a significant relationship between <b>due</b> <b>process</b> rights <b>and</b> school climate as perceived by students in terms of(a) gender, (b) race, and (c) school type; (6) There is a significant relationship between <b>due</b> <b>process</b> rights <b>and</b> school policy as perceived by students in terms of(a) gender, (b) race, and (c) school type; (7) There is a significant relationship between <b>due</b> <b>process</b> rights <b>and</b> students 2 ̆ 7 attitudes toward authority figures in terms of(a) gender, (b) race, and (c) school type; (8) There is a significant relationship between <b>due</b> <b>process</b> rights <b>and</b> classroom learning environment as perceived by students in terms of(a) gender, (b) race, and (c) school type...|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the study were}} to determine the scope and background of student <b>due</b> <b>process</b> policies <b>and</b> procedures utilized within Indiana school corporations, and to analyze the content of <b>due</b> <b>process</b> policies <b>and</b> procedures utilized within Indiana school corporations in comparison with standards recommended by legal and educational authorities. An Initial Survey form was mailed to the superintendent of each school corporation in Indiana. Superintendents reporting written, school board adopted policies and procedures for student <b>due</b> <b>process</b> were requested to send a copy for the content analysis portion of the study. A Background Survey instrument was mailed to each superintendent providing a copy of <b>due</b> <b>process</b> policies <b>and</b> procedures. Information was sought relative to the formulation, implementation, and utilization of student <b>due</b> <b>process</b> policies <b>and</b> procedures. Recommended standards and guidelines for procedural <b>due</b> <b>process</b> for students, from both legal and educational sources, were reviewed. The standards and guidelines were organized into a recording instrument to help facilitate a content analysis of the policies and procedures. Major findings of the study were: 1. Superintendents from 43 of 280 Indiana school corporations reported written, school board adopted policies and procedures outlining student <b>due</b> <b>process</b> in effect as of December 1, 1971. 2. The total number of school corporations with written, school board adopted <b>due</b> <b>process</b> policies <b>and</b> procedures has increased annually since 1969. 3, The persons most directly affected by discipline <b>and</b> <b>due</b> <b>process</b> [...] students, teachers, and parents [...] were not involved in the formulation of policies and procedures. 4. Approximately 71 per cent of the students involved in <b>due</b> <b>process</b> hearings were reported to have been suspended or expelled. Approximately 29 per cent of the students involved were reported to have been reinstated. 5. The building principal was most often specified as the hearing officer. The school board was most often specified as the hearing board. 6. In most instances, the student and parents received the required information in the notice of the charges; however, most notices lacked an explanation of the procedural mechanics of the hearing. 7. The amount of time allowed the student to prepare a defense was arbitrary or not specified in most policies. 8. As a group, the <b>due</b> <b>process</b> policies were most often lacking ini (a) including a provision for students and/or parents to give a written waiver of formal hearing procedures; (b) including a provision guaranteeing the student prior inspection of documents and evidence; and (c) Including a provision guaranteeing student protection against self-incrimination. 9. The type of hearing record most often reported consisted of fill-in forms or written narrative summaries. 10. Appeals were most often directed to the superintendent. Major recommendations of the study were: 1. Students, parents, and teachers be involved in the formulation of <b>due</b> <b>process</b> policies <b>and</b> procedures. 2. Humanistic aspects of the student-institutional relationship be emphasized in teacher education and school administration courses. 3. In-service education relative to student <b>due</b> <b>process</b> be provided for both professional and non-professional personnel in school districts. 4. After September 1, 1972, when the Indiana student conduct <b>and</b> <b>due</b> <b>process</b> law becomes effective, a follow-up study be conducted to determine what changes have occurred in the scope, background, and content of student <b>due</b> <b>process</b> policies <b>and</b> procedures.
