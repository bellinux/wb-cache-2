40|$|Nonlinear {{quantisation}} of an equal-amplitude <b>dual-tone</b> <b>signal</b> is analysed using a simple, general approach. The actual {{transfer characteristic}} of the quantiser is split into two nonlinear characteristics; the first represents the nonlinearity error, and the second represents the quantisation error sawtooth. Whereas the nonlinearity error characteristic is modelled by a third-order polynomial, the quantisation error sawtooth is modelled by a Fourier series. This strategy yields exact infinite-series expressions for all the intermodulation and distortion components produced by the nonlinear quantisation of an equal-amplitude <b>dual-tone</b> <b>signal.</b> Special cases are considered where the infinite-series expressions {{can be reduced to}} convenient. Approximate analytical expressions. The effects of the parameters of the nonlinearity error characteristic are studied, and the feasibility of minimising the intermodulation performance of the quantiser is explore...|$|R

50|$|The DTMF {{standard}} assigns specific frequencies to each {{column and}} row of push-buttons in the telephone keypad; the columns in the push-button pad have higher-frequency tones, and rows have lower-frequency tones in the audible range.

30|$|To use the RIPS for multipath-rich indoor environments, a {{multihop}} {{scheme is}} proposed in [18]. The approach {{is similar to}} [19], where sinusoids are transmitted at multiple frequencies, and a subspace-based method is used to detect the first-arriving path. On the other hand, the ranging signal of the RIPS is modified in [20 – 22] {{to make the system}} robust to the fading. A dual-tone RIPS (DRIPS) [20] uses <b>dual-tone</b> <b>signaling</b> to cancel the phase shifts due to fading. Synchronized anchor nodes transmit <b>dual-tone</b> <b>signals</b> simultaneously, which allow the target node to directly estimate its position. The DRIPS is further enhanced in uDRIPS [21] by employing undersampling techniques at the receiver. A space-time RIPS (STRIPS) [22] uses a space-time code and millimeter wave (MMW) band to combat fading and multipath effects. These aforementioned are some of the examples, and they show the flexibility of the RIPS. However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, formal investigation of the performance bounds for the RIPS has not appeared in the literature. Our theoretical analysis presented in this paper can serve as benchmark to gauge various proposed algorithms.|$|R

50|$|When Touch-Tone {{service was}} {{introduced}} in the 1960s, the <b>dual-tone</b> multi-frequency <b>signaling</b> (DTMF) tone generator also required correct polarity as it depended on the line D.C. voltage for operation. Later Touch-Tone telephones included a diode bridge that eliminated the polarity sensitivity, so that consumer telephone service is essentially immune to reversal today. However, some special circuits, such as some direct inward dialing (DID) trunks, T-1 lines, and ground start lines connected to field side (terminal) equipment, e.g., a corporate private branch exchange (PBX) switch, correctly operate only with proper tip and ring polarity.|$|R
50|$|Starting {{with the}} {{integration}} of faxing devices into computers via Fax modems the automated answering of voice calls by a computer went live via specific software, like e.g. TalkWorks.

50|$|When dialing from a {{land-line}} telephone, {{the telephone}} number is encoded and transmitted across the telephone line {{in form of}} <b>dual-tone</b> multi-frequency <b>signaling</b> (DTMF). The tones control the telephone system by instructing the telephone switch where to route the call. These control tones are sent over the same channel, the copper wire, and in the frequency range (300 Hz to 3.4 kHz) as the audio of the telephone call. In-band signaling is also used on older telephone carrier systems to provide inter-exchange information for routing calls. Examples {{of this kind of}} in-band signaling system are the Signaling System No. 5 (SS5) and R2 signalling.|$|R
50|$|Satellite {{programming}} {{often used}} audible <b>dual-tone</b> multi-frequency (DTMF) <b>signals</b> to trigger events at affiliate stations. This allowed the automatic local insertion of ads and station IDs. Because there are 12 (or 16) tone pairs, and typically four tones were sent {{in rapid succession}} (less than one second), more events could be triggered than by sub-audible tones (usually 25 Hz and 35 Hz).|$|R
50|$|Multi-frequency {{signaling}} (MF) is a {{group of}} signaling methods that use a mixture of two pure tone (pure sine wave) sounds. Various MF signaling protocols were devised by the Bell System and CCITT. The earliest of these were for in-band signaling between switching centers, where long-distance telephone operators used a 16-digit keypad to input the next portion of the destination telephone number in order to contact the next downstream long-distance telephone operator. This semi-automated signaling and switching proved successful in both speed and cost effectiveness. Based on this prior success with using MF by specialists to establish long-distance telephone calls, <b>dual-tone</b> multi-frequency <b>signaling</b> was developed for end-user signaling without the assistance of operators.|$|R
50|$|A {{traditional}} landline telephone system, {{also known}} as {{plain old telephone service}} (POTS), commonly carries both control and audio signals on the same twisted pair (C in diagram) of insulated wires, the telephone line. The control and signaling equipment consists of three components, the ringer, the hookswitch, and a dial. The ringer, or beeper, light or other device (A7), alerts the user to incoming calls. The hookswitch signals to the central office that the user has picked up the handset to either answer a call or initiate a call. A dial, if present, is used by the subscriber to transmit a telephone number to the central office when initiating a call. Until the 1960s dials used almost exclusively the rotary technology, which was replaced by <b>dual-tone</b> multi-frequency <b>signaling</b> (DTMF) with pushbutton telephones (A4).|$|R

50|$|For {{outgoing}} calls, the Line Link Frame {{acted like}} the line finder {{of the panel}} switch, autonomously connecting the line to a junctor, which corresponded to the cord circuit of the old cord telephone switchboard. As in the panel switch, the sender then found the chosen junctor and supplied dial tone. Like the panel switch, the 1XB common control {{was based on a}} complex, versatile sender circuit. The sender decoded dial pulses and was retrofitted for <b>dual-tone</b> multi-frequency <b>signaling</b> (DTMF) in the 1960s. A large number of senders used a common translator circuit to detect a call going to a nearby area code to be stored in abbreviated form. It called in an auxiliary sender when necessary to implement Direct Distance Dialing (DDD). Like the panel switch, two or more offices with separate incoming sections could share an outgoing section for more efficient trunking. Unlike the panel switch, it was rare to combine more than two this way.|$|R

This phone, the Western Electric 1500, had only ten buttons. In 1968 it was replaced by the twelve-button model 2500, adding the asterisk or star (*) and pound or hash (#) keys.

50|$|The year 1936 {{brought the}} {{announcement}} of the model 302 telephone, the first Western Electric instrument that combined the desktop telephone mount with the subscriber set and ringer in one unit. The design was conceived by the engineering firm of industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss and it was the mainstay of American telephone service until 1950, when it was followed by the model 500 telephone, which became the most extensively produced telephone model in the industry's history. It was continually updated over time, reflecting new materials and manufacturing processes, such as quieter and smoother dial gearing and a printed circuit board for the network electronics. The model 500 was discontinued in 1986, in favor of the type 2500, that had been available since 1969.
