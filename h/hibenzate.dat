50|$|Tipepidine (INN) (brand names Asverin, Antupex, Asvelik, Asvex, Bitiodin, Cofdenin A, Hustel, Nodal, Sotal), {{also known}} as {{tipepidine}} <b>hibenzate</b> (JAN), is a synthetic, non-opioid antitussive and expectorant of the thiambutene class. It acts as an inhibitor of G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs). The drug was discovered in the 1950s, and was developed in Japan in 1959. It is used as the <b>hibenzate</b> and citrate salts.|$|E
50|$|Analysis of {{pharmaceuticals}} by MLC is also gaining popularity. The selectivity and {{peak shape}} of MLC over commonly used ion-pair chromatography is much enhanced. MLC mimics, yet enhances, the selectivity offered by ion-pairing reagents for {{the separation of}} active ingredients in pharmaceutical drugs. For basic drugs, MLC improves the excessive peak tailing frequently observed in ion-pairing. Hydrophilic drugs are often unretained using conventional HPLC, are retained by MLC due to solubilization into the micelles. Commonly found drugs in cold medications such as acetaminophen, L-ascorbic acid, phenylpropanolamine HCL, tipepidine <b>hibenzate,</b> and chlorpheniramine maleate have been successfully separated with good peak shape using MLC. Additional basic drugs like many narcotics, such as codeine and morphine, have also been successfully separated using MLC.|$|E

The safety of tipepidine in children and adults has already been established. It is reported that tipepidine inhibits G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) -channel currents. The inhibition of GIRK channels by tipepidine is expected to modulate the level of monoamines in the brain. We put forward the hypothesis that tipepidine can improve attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms by modulating monoaminergic neurotransmission through the inhibition of GIRK channels. The purpose of this open-label trial was to confirm whether treatment with tipepidine can improve symptoms in pediatric patients with ADHD. Subjects and methods: This was a 4 -week, open-label, proof-of-efficacy pilot study for pediatric subjects with ADHD. Ten pediatric ADHD subjects (70 % male; mean age, 9. 9 years; combined [inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive] subtype, n= 7; inattentive subtype, n= 3; hyperimpulsive subtype, n= 0) received tipepidine <b>hibenzate</b> taken orally at 30 mg/day for 4 weeks. All subjects were assessed using the ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS), Japanese version, and the Das–Naglieri Cognitive Assessment System (DN-CAS), Japanese version. Results: A comparison of baseline scores and 4 -week end-point scores showed that all the ADHD-RS scores (total scores, hyperimpulsive subscores, and inattentive subscores) improved significantly (P< 0. 001). Furthermore, a comparison of baseline DN-CAS total scores and 4 -week end-point scores showed a mild trend of improvement (P= 0. 093). Tipepidine was well tolerated, with no patients discontinuing medication because of side effects. Conclusion: Our pilot study suggests that tipepidine therapy {{may prove to be}} an effective alternative treatment for pediatric patients with ADHD. Nonetheless, more detailed randomized, double-blind trials are needed to confirm tipepidine’s efficacy.
