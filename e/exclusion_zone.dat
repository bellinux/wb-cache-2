5|$|In February 1994 (when {{air strikes}} were {{originally}} threatened), NATO {{had created a}} heavy weapons <b>exclusion</b> <b>zone</b> around Sarajevo, and collected weapons {{at a number of}} sites. On 5 August, the VRS seized several weapons from the Illidža Weapons Collection site in clear violation of the <b>exclusion</b> <b>zone</b> agreement. During the seizure, Serb forces injured a Ukrainian UNPROFOR peacekeeper. In response to the attack, the UN once again requested NATO air support. Two U.S. A-10 aircraft repeatedly strafed Serb targets, and the Serbs returned the seized weapons to the collection site.|$|E

5|$|On 12 November 2015, the B-52 began {{freedom of}} {{navigation}} operations in the South China Sea in response to Chinese man-made islands in the region. Chinese forces, claiming jurisdiction within a 12-mile <b>exclusion</b> <b>zone</b> of the islands, ordered the bombers to leave the area, but they refused, not recognizing jurisdiction. On 10 January 2016, a B-52 overflew parts of South Korea escorted by South Korean F-15Ks and U.S. F-16s {{in response to the}} supposed test of a hydrogen bomb by North Korea.|$|E

5|$|Argentina had a tense {{relationship}} with the United Kingdom because of the recently ended Falklands War. The British government banned all foreign ships from the <b>exclusion</b> <b>zone</b> of the islands in 1986. Argentina organised air and marine patrols, as well as military maneuvers in the Patagonia. However, this {{was not enough to}} placate the military hard-liners in Argentina. Alfonsín proposed the postponement the sovereignty discussions, instead negotiating for a de jure cease of hostilities, with a {{reduction in the number of}} military forces and a normalization of Argentina–United Kingdom relations. The United Kingdom did not trust the proposal, suspecting that it was a cover-up for sovereignty discussions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} days of August 1995, NATO {{launched}} Operation Deliberate Force—an air campaign targeting the VRS. This campaign was launched in response to the second Markale massacre of 28 August, which came {{on the heels of the}} Srebrenica massacre. Airstrikes began on 30 August, initially targeting VRS air defences, and striking targets near Sarajevo. The campaign was briefly suspended on 1 September and its scope was expanded to target artillery and storage facilities around the city. The bombing resumed on 5 September, and its scope extended to VRS air defences near Banja Luka by 9 September as NATO had nearly exhausted its list of targets near Sarajevo. On 13 September, the Bosnian Serbs accepted NATO's demand for the establishment of an <b>exclusion</b> <b>zone</b> around Sarajevo and the campaign ceased.|$|E

40|$|The present work {{examines}} naval <b>exclusion</b> <b>zones,</b> {{with particular}} emphasis on the jus in bello applicable to such zones. The issues presented by the establishment and use of naval exclusion relate to {{many aspects of the}} law of the sea and naval warfare. Naval <b>exclusion</b> <b>zones</b> represent an important issue for national security policy makers, in that the use of such zones during armed conflicts at sea can limit the geographic scope of the conflict. While such zones may promote the principles enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter and discourage belligerents from waging naval warfare on a global scale, the use of such zones have the potential for disaster, in that naval commanders who mistakenly operate under the assumption that such zones are “free-fire zones” run the risk of unlawfully sinking hospital ships or other protected vessels. Moreover, naval <b>exclusion</b> <b>zones</b> have become increasingly common during modern naval conflicts, including the Falklands, Iran-Iraq and Persian Gulf Wars. Finally, even when used within the bounds of international law, naval <b>exclusion</b> <b>zones</b> still have the potential to disrupt commercial uses of the seas since they often cut across the claims of neutrals, potentially interfering with neutral commerce, oil exploration or fishing. This thesis traces the development of naval <b>exclusion</b> <b>zones,</b> with {{particular emphasis on}} the following: • The historical uses of such zones • The permissible threatres of naval operations under the modern law of the sea regime • The permissible scope of activity within such zones vis-à- vis belligerent warships and merchant vessels • The rights of neutrals in and around naval <b>exclusion</b> <b>zones</b> • The legality of such zones as analysed through the traditional sources of international law The thesis then concludes with recommendations for clarifying and strengthening the rules concerning the scope of permissible activity within such zones.

A further disastrous release of radioactive materials followed the 2011 Japanese tsunami which damaged the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, resulting in hydrogen gas explosions and partial meltdowns classified as a Level 7 event.

40|$|Many {{hydrophilic}} {{materials in}} aqueous solution show near-surface zones that exclude suspended colloids and dissolved molecules. These <b>exclusion</b> <b>zones</b> (EZs) can extend for tens to hundreds of micrometers from the hydrophilic surface, and show physicochemical properties that differ from bulk water. So far, only continuous surfaces of polymers, gels, or biological specimens have been studied. In this report, we explore the interactions between <b>exclusion</b> <b>zones</b> generated by discontinuous, regularly spaced EZ-generating surfaces, namely strips of Nafi on on a glass surface. Various inter-strip spacings were studied. When Nafi on surfaces are separated by 100 µm or less, EZs merged with one another, forming a single, continuous, stable EZ. Separations larger than 100 µm produced discontinuous EZs that did not merge. This result has implication for the mechanism by which independent EZs can merge with one another...|$|R
