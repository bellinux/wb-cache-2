40|$|European Union (EU) policymakers have {{persistently}} supported first-generation biofuels {{despite the}} clearly emerging picture of small or even negative green house gas mitigation effects. This {{leads to the}} conclusion that support is driven by other objectives, for example <b>income</b> <b>effects.</b> Against this background, the main objective {{of this article is to}} analyse the <b>income</b> <b>effects</b> of abolishing biofuel policies as well as to explore the link between these effects and lobbying decisions taken by farmers' associtions representing different groups of German farmers. <b>Income</b> <b>effects</b> are estimated for different farm types and regions, and differences between farm net value added and family farm income are analysed. To understand the link between <b>income</b> <b>effects</b> and lobbying decisions, our quantitative results are compared with the biofuel policy positions of different farmers' associations. Our results suggest that, in the long run, average <b>income</b> <b>effects</b> are small, especially if the ownership of production factors is accounted for in the income calculation. Many farms show losses if biofuel support is abolished, but others even benefit from lower rental costs and experience positive <b>income</b> <b>effects.</b> Farmers' associations seem to be able to well assess the <b>income</b> <b>effects</b> of EU biofuel policy for different types of farms...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} <b>income</b> <b>effects</b> on German children's educational pathways, considering all three secondary school tracks (gymnasium,,realschule, and hauptschule) and using measures {{of income and}} other variables that cover the entire childhood.

Data come from the German Socioeconomic Panel Survey. Study results find that, for this German child outcome, it is late-childhood income that matters, and <b>income</b> <b>effects</b> are linear rather than non-linear. The study also finds that <b>income</b> <b>effects</b> that do exist are small, in absolute terms, and relative {{to the effects of}} other determinants.

25|$|In {{economics}} and consumer theory, a Giffen good {{is a product}} that people consume more of as the price rises and vice versaâ€”violating the basic law of demand in microeconomics. For any other sort of good, {{as the price of}} the good rises, the substitution effect makes consumers purchase less of it, and more of substitute goods; for most goods, the <b>income</b> <b>effect</b> (due to the effective decline in available income due to more being spent on existing units of this good) reinforces this decline in demand for the good. But a Giffen good is so strongly an inferior good in the minds of consumers (being more in demand at lower incomes) that this contrary <b>income</b> <b>effect</b> more than offsets the substitution effect, and the net effect of the good's price rise is to increase demand for it.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesAn underexplored {{question}} in the debate on incorporating productivity costs as costs or effects in a cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis is whether people include effects of ill health on income in health state valuations (HSV). The same holds for the actual inclusion in HSV {{of the effects of}} ill health on leisure. This study aims to test whether respondents to HSV using time trade-off (TTO) questions include <b>income</b> and leisure <b>effects</b> without instructions. Moreover, it tests the consequences of explicit instructions to include or exclude <b>income</b> <b>effects.</b> MethodsThree questionnaires were administered among the general public. Respondents were asked to value three distinct EuroQol descriptive system health states using TTO. In version 1, respondents were asked afterwards whether they included <b>income</b> <b>effects.</b> In versions 2 and 3, respondents were instructed upfront to include or exclude <b>income</b> <b>effects.</b> They were furthermore asked whether they included leisure effects. ResultsA total of 222 respondents completed the questionnaire. In version 1, 64 % of the respondents spontaneously included <b>income</b> <b>effects,</b> not resulting in differences in mean valuations. In versions 2 and 3, 88 % included leisure time, resulting in a significantly lower TTO value in one health state. With explicit instructions, respondents instructed to include income gave lower HSV for the worst health state presented. ConclusionsRespondents in our sample did not consistently include <b>income</b> <b>effects</b> and leisure <b>effects.</b> Including <b>income</b> <b>effects</b> only had (some) effect on TTO valuations after an explicit instruction. If these results are confirmed in future research, this implies that <b>income</b> <b>effects</b> may be best captured on the cost-side of the CE ratio. Spontaneous inclusion or exclusion of leisure time appeared to be more influential...|$|R

40|$|I generalize the {{workhorse}} {{model of}} network competition (Armstrong, 1998; Laffont, Rey and Tirole, 1998 a,b) to include <b>income</b> <b>effects</b> in call demand. <b>Income</b> <b>effects</b> imply that call demand depends {{also on the}} subscription fee, {{not only on the}} call price. In the standard case of differentiated networks, weak <b>income</b> <b>effects</b> are enough to deliver results in line with stylized facts: The networks have an incentive to agree on high mobile termination rates to soften competition. They charge a higher price for calls outside (off-net) than inside (on-net) the network. This vindicates the use of (a perturbation of) the workhorse model of network competition. ...|$|R
25|$|Higher pay for {{overtime}} hours {{can reduce}} or negate {{the effect of}} a backward bending labour supply curve, by increasing wages only for hours worked beyond a certain amount. Overtime maintains the substitution effect at a high labour supply. However, the <b>income</b> <b>effect</b> from the wages increasing on all the previous hours worked is eliminated. Thus, higher hourly overtime pay can cause workers to work more hours than if the higher rate is paid on all hours.|$|E
25|$|A {{shift in}} {{preferences}} at the microeconomic level, {{caused by an}} <b>income</b> <b>effect</b> can change the make-up of {{the consumer price index}} to include proportionately more expenditure on services. This alone may shift the consumer price index, and might make the non-trade sector look relatively less productive than it had been when demand was lower; if service quality (rather than quantity) follows diminishing returns to labour input, a general demand for a higher service quality automatically produces a reduction in per-capita productivity.|$|E

40|$|The recent public {{economics}} literature {{involves an}} apparent consensus that <b>income</b> <b>effects</b> reduce {{the costs of}} raising revenues and hence increase the desirable level of public good provision. Higher taxes can indeed reduce the demand for leisure [...] and hence increase the supply of taxed labor [...] through <b>income</b> <b>effects.</b> However, the consensus is wrong because the <b>income</b> <b>effects</b> of taxes must be considered symmetrically with those from provision of public goods. This paper uses a model with multiple public goods and taxes to derive consistent measures of the marginal benefits of publicly-provided goods and their marginal social costs. With this model, the authors show that either compensated approaches excluding these <b>income</b> <b>effects</b> or uncompensated approaches including them may be used. If an uncompensated measure of the marginal cost of funds is used, however, the benefits of providing public goods should be adjusted with a simple, benefit multiplier not previously seen in the literature. Once this is done, the optimal level of public provision is independent of whether compensated or uncompensated approaches are used. Proper accounting for these <b>income</b> <b>effects</b> [...] or their omission using a compensated approach [...] appears to substantially raise the hurdle for government provision where there are substantial taxes bearing on labor.

25|$|The law {{of demand}} states that, in general, price and {{quantity}} demanded {{in a given}} market are inversely related. That is, the higher {{the price of a}} product, the less of it people would be prepared to buy (other things unchanged). As the price of a commodity falls, consumers move toward it from relatively more expensive goods (the substitution effect). In addition, purchasing power from the price decline increases ability to buy (the <b>income</b> <b>effect).</b> Other factors can change demand; for example an increase in income will shift the demand curve for a normal good outward relative to the origin, as in the figure.

40|$|When {{consumption}} {{goods are}} indivisible, individuals {{have to hold}} enough resources to cross a purchasing threshold. If individuals are liquidity constrained, {{they are unable to}} borrow to cross that threshold. Instead, we show that such individuals, even if risk averse, may choose to play gamble through playing lotteries to have a chance of crossing the threshold. One implication of this model is that <b>income</b> <b>effects</b> for individuals who choose to play lotteries are likely to be larger than for the general population. This in turn implies that estimating <b>income</b> <b>effects</b> through the random allocation of lottery winnings {{is likely to be a}} biased estimate of <b>income</b> <b>effects</b> of the broader population who chose not to gamble. Using UK data on lottery wins, other windfalls and durable good purchases, we show that lottery players display higher <b>income</b> <b>effects</b> than non-players but only amongst those likely to be credit constrained. This is consistent with credit constrained, risk-averse agents gambling in order to cross a purchase threshold and to convexify their budget set. ...|$|R
2500|$|A price drop for {{commodity}} X causes two effects. The {{reduced price}} alters relative prices {{in favour of}} commodity X, known as the substitution effect. This is illustrated by a movement down the indifference curve from point A to point B (a pivot of the budget constraint about the original indifference curve). At the same time, the price reduction increases consumer purchasing power, known as the <b>income</b> <b>effect</b> (an outward shift of the budget constraint). This {{is illustrated by the}} shifting out of the dotted line to MP (where P = income divided by the new price of commodity X). The substitution effect (point A to point B) raises the quantity demanded of commodity X from Xa to Xb while the <b>income</b> <b>effect</b> lowers the quantity demanded from Xb to Xc. The net effect is a reduction in quantity demanded from Xa to Xc making commodity X a Giffen good by definition. Any good where the <b>income</b> <b>effect</b> more than compensates for the substitution effect is a [...] Giffen good.|$|E
2500|$|The {{substitution}} effect {{is the change}} in demands resulting from a price change that alters {{the slope of the}} budget constraint but leaves the consumer on the same indifference curve. In other words, it illustrates the consumer's new consumption basket after the price change while being compensated as to allow the consumer to be as happy as he or she was previously. By this effect, the consumer is posited to substitute toward the good that becomes comparatively less expensive. In the illustration below this corresponds to an imaginary budget constraint denoted SC being tangent to the indifference curve I1. Then the <b>income</b> <b>effect</b> from the rise in purchasing power from a price fall reinforces the {{substitution effect}}. [...] If the good is an inferior good, then the <b>income</b> <b>effect</b> will offset in some degree the substitution effect. [...] If the <b>income</b> <b>effect</b> for an inferior good is sufficiently strong, the consumer will buy less of the good when it becomes less expensive, a Giffen good (commonly believed to be a rarity).|$|E

2500|$|For cost {{reducing}} resource efficiency, {{distinguishing between}} {{direct and indirect}} effects is shown in Figure 1 below. [...] The horizontal axis shows units of consumption of the targets good (which could be for example clothes washing, and {{measured in terms of}} kilograms of clean clothes) with consumption of all other goods and services on the vertical axis. [...] An economical technology change that enables each unit of washing to be produced with less electricity results in a reduction of the price per unit of washing. [...] This shifts the household budget line rightwards. [...] The result is a substitution effect because of the decreased relative price, but also an <b>income</b> <b>effect</b> due to the increased real income. [...] The substitution effect increases consumption of washing from Q1 to QS, and the <b>income</b> <b>effect</b> from QS to Q2. [...] The total increase in consumption of washing from Q1 to Q2 and the resulting increase in electricity consumption is the direct effect. [...] The indirect effect comprises the increase in other consumption, from O1 to O2. [...] The scale of each of these effects depends on the elasticity of demand for each of the goods, and the embodied resource or externality associated with each good. Indirect effects are difficult to measure empirically. In the manufacturing sector, {{it has been estimated that}} there is about a 24% rebound effect due to increases in fuel efficiency. A parallel effect will happen for cost saving efficient technologies for producers, where output and substitution effects will occur.|$|E
