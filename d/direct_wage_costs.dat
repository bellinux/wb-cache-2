40|$|Robert Pollin and Jeannette Wicks-Lim {{consider}} {{the economic impact}} of two living wage proposals for Nashville-Davidson County, Tennessee. Pollin and Wicks-Lim look at the overall costs of each proposal, which offer a wage of $ 10. 80 per hour and health insurance benefits to two alternative pools of workers, and break those costs into <b>direct</b> <b>wage</b> <b>costs,</b> health insurance costs, and ripple-effect costs. They place these expenses in context as a share of the local government budget, and consider a range of potential revenue sources to cover them. The authors then discuss the benefits that the living wage proposals would bring, not only to the workers, but to state and local governments, businesses, and low-income communities in general. ...|$|E

For example, some states set eligibility based on family income above 200  % of the poverty line (Pavetti et al., 2011). In addition, subsidies of 100  % may have allayed employer concerns about worker quality since they could terminate the worker without having incurred any <b>direct</b> <b>wage</b> <b>costs.</b> Also, {{in some cases the}} employer of record was a non-profit intermediary or workforce agency, protecting firms where workers were placed from adverse impacts on their UI tax rating and other legal liability (Lower-Basch, 2011). 15 [...]...|$|E
40|$|The {{ratio of}} nonwage labor costs (for social security, pensions, {{vacation}} days, severence compensation, and the like) to <b>direct</b> <b>wage</b> <b>costs</b> is proportionately higher in Europe and Latin America than in Asia and Africa - largely because workers there are protected more by regulations. The distortionary growth of labor costs because of increasing nonwage costs is not {{common in the}} LDCs however. The author of this paper found that international differences in labor costs are attributable largely to differences in labor productivity and capital-labor ratios. The author also found that labor costs declined significantly in almost all LDCs in the 1980 s, and {{that the impact of}} declining labor costs on manufacturing employment was statistically significant - and bodes well for the growth of nontraditional exports. International differences in labor cost levels are important, especially when one compares LDC and industrial economies. But differences between labor cost levels in terms of per capita output are not so large. This suggests the importance of different capital-labor ratios.

Researchers used a computer simulation model with data from a 400 bed VA hospital. Literature suggested a high nurse turnover rate associated with dissatisfaction engendered by forced floating to unfamiliar units. <b>Direct</b> <b>wage</b> <b>cost</b> differences were negligible when UUF and CUF floating patterns were compared, so absolute costs were not the defining issue. UUF staffing patterns produced significantly fewer understaffed shifts (by nursing hours) than CUF floating permitted. The essential quality of care trade-off is between the UUF pattern that provided sufficient nursing hours of care vs. the CUF pattern that provided less absolute availability in hours of nursing care, but a better oriented staff.

30|$|While using nonstandard work {{arrangements}} {{employers are}} confronted with a trade-off because {{they need to take}} into account costs and benefits of certain work arrangements (Houseman 2001; Sesselmeier 2007). <b>Direct</b> <b>wages,</b> additional <b>costs</b> for social security and costs of hiring and firing need to be weighed against the workers’ productivity. Nonstandard work usually has certain (cost) advantages compared to other alternatives in this respect. Firstly, {{it can be used to}} safe labour costs. This might, e.g., be the case if a firm employs agency workers which are not covered by its particular pay agreement. Secondly, nonstandard work arrangements may also lead to lower labour costs for regular workers because extra payments to regular workers for overtime might not be necessary to the same extent. Thirdly, particularly fixed-term contracts and temporary agency work reduce costs of hiring and firing. Such an option is of particular relevance in an institutional framework in which dismissal protection legislation applying to standard workers is comparatively strict. The different types of temporary employment can be used as a recruiting device and may therefore increase the efficiency of matching labour supply and demand (Osterman and Burton 2005; Boockmann and Hagen 2008). Fourthly, nonstandard work arrangements offer more flexibility to adapt available personal resources to variations in product demand (Bentolila and Saint-Paul 1992; Nunziata and Staffolani 2007; Nienhüser 2008; Picchio 2012). And finally nonstandard work arrangements can be seen as a kind of buffer to protect core workers. In doing so, firms can combine both the advantages of internal labour markets and flexible labour (Alewell 1993; Osterman and Burton 2005; Pfeifer 2009).|$|R

More precisely, they suggest that firm rents increase on average by 1.4 % (0.6 %) in the long run (short run) if the fraction of high-educated workers within a firm increases by 10 percentage points (and is compensated by a proportional decrease in the share of low-educated workers). Yet, the size of this effect is found to depend crucially on workers’ characteristics (i.e. their age and gender). The misalignment between education-driven productivity gains and <b>wage</b> <b>cost</b> differentials appears to be only verified among young workers. Put differently, results suggest that high-educated (low-educated) workers are no longer under-paid (over-paid) when they become older. Findings are also quite different according to gender.

However, when time savings become more and <b>wage</b> <b>costs</b> less important, the difference between the optimum spans of control shrinks; in the limit, when <b>wage</b> <b>costs</b> are not considered at all, they become equal.
