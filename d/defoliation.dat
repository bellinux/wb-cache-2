5|$|Once {{widespread}} in Southeast Asia, the Javan rhinoceros was presumed extinct in Vietnam in the mid-1970s, {{at the end}} of the Vietnam War. The combat wrought havoc on the ecosystems of the region through use of napalm, extensive <b>defoliation</b> from Agent Orange, aerial bombing, use of landmines, and overhunting by local poachers.|$|E
5|$|Baculoviruses are {{specific}} to individual insect host species and {{have been shown to}} be useful in biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used to spray large areas of forest in North America where larvae of the gypsy moth are causing serious <b>defoliation.</b> The moth larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other larvae.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Cyclone Magda's arrival, several {{severe weather}} {{warnings}} were issued for the coastline of Western Australia. Although the storm made landfall with winds of 130km/h (80mph), damage was limited {{due to the}} sparsely populated region it struck. The most severe damage was <b>defoliation</b> around Kuri Bay. Following its usage, the name Magda was retired and replaced with Megan.|$|E
5|$|Struggle for the Land (1993; reissued 2002) is a {{collection}} of essays in which Churchill chronicles what he describes as the U.S. government's systematic exploitation of Native lands and the killing or displacement of American Indians. He details Native American efforts in the 19th and 20th centuries to prevent <b>defoliation</b> and industrial practices such as surface mining.|$|E
5|$|Young forests (trees <2 years old) {{are most}} at risk from ash falls {{and are likely to}} be {{destroyed}} by ash deposits >100 mm. Ash fall is unlikely to kill mature trees, but ash loading may break large branches during heavy ash falls (>500 mm). <b>Defoliation</b> of trees may also occur, especially if there is a coarse ash component within the ash fall.|$|E
5|$|After 400–500 {{accumulated}} degree-days above , adults {{begin to}} emerge from trees in late spring, and peak emergence occurs around 1000 degree-days. After emergence, adults feed for one week on ash leaves in the canopy before mating, but cause little <b>defoliation</b> in the process. Males hover around trees, locate females by visual cues, and drop directly onto the female to mate; mating can last 50 minutes, and females may mate with multiple males over their lifespan. A typical female can live around six weeks and lay approximately 40–70 eggs, but females that live longer can lay up to 200 eggs.|$|E
5|$|Cases of {{sick and}} dying trees of C.australis were first {{reported}} {{in the northern part}} of the North Island in 1987. The syndrome, eventually called Sudden Decline, soon reached epidemic proportions in Northland and Auckland. Affected trees usually suffer total <b>defoliation</b> within 2 to 12 months. The foliage turns yellow, and the oldest leaves wither and fall off. Growth of leaves ceases, and eventually all the leaves fall, leaving dead branches, often with the dried-out flowering panicles still attached. At the same time, the bark on the trunk becomes loose and detaches easily. The greatest number of dead trees (18 to 26 percent) was recorded around Auckland.|$|E
5|$|The {{high winds}} {{produced}} by Emily caused considerable impact in Quintana Roo, {{especially in the}} municipality of Solidaridad, leaving nearly 200,000 residences without power. In terms of structural damage, 851 homes were impacted in varying degrees. Roughly 13,345acres (5,400hectares) of forests and agricultural land was affected by the storm; some swathes of trees experienced <b>defoliation.</b> The most substantial losses associated with the hurricane stemmed from the tourism industry, with hotels experiencing 947million pesos ($88.7million) worth of damage. More than 12,500 rooms, nearly one-fifth of the state's available hotel infrastructure, sustained damage. Overall, damage in the state reached 1.11billion pesos ($104.3million).|$|E
5|$|Prehistoric Polynesian {{habitation}} on Nihoa {{may have}} initially {{led to a}} decrease in the plant population of A. brownii. Major threats to the plant include invasive species, fire, and hybridization with other Amaranthus species. Inbreeding is a serious threat, as the small plant population must reproduce within its own circle resulting in genetic defects. A. brownii is also forced to compete with the non-native weed (Portulaca oleracea), the plant's main alien species threat. In 2002 and 2004, the invasive gray bird grasshopper (Schistocerca nitens) presented an even larger threat to A. brownii. First recorded on the island in 1977, the increasing population density of gray bird grasshoppers led to massive <b>defoliation</b> on the island, leaving A. brownii at greater risk of predation. In 2004 alone, an estimated 400,000 gray bird grasshoppers destroyed almost 90% of the vegetation on Nihoa.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began at}} 09:30 on 8 January with heavy American preparatory fire from artillery, {{as well as}} napalm and airstrikes from B-52 bombers which {{resulted}} in significant <b>defoliation.</b> Soon after the airmobile operation commenced with the first American units being inserted by helicopter to the north, west and south. The US 3rd Infantry Brigade—under the command of Colonel William Brodbeck—was subsequently inserted by helicopter and by road. The brigade headquarters and command element departed Di An in convoy and reached Trung Lap on the western boundary of the brigade's area of operations by midday. Concurrently, two battalions were inserted by helicopter to the south-west, one blocking {{the south side of}} the Ho Bo Woods while the other conducted a sweep. The Americans were in contact almost immediately, although the engagements were generally small scale, or involving snipers. Meanwhile, the brigade's third battalion moved by road to Trung Lap and then moved on foot to its assigned search area.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} {{result of}} the 11 November bombing halt was that the average daily sortie rate over southern Laos rose to 620 per day before the new campaign had even begun. The freeing of aircraft (Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps) {{that had previously been}} participating in Rolling Thunder, when combined with those from Steel Tiger and Tiger Hound (which were both superseded by Commando Hunt), promised to create an interdiction effort of unprecedented scale. The new sensor-directed effort would see, for the first time, continuous round-the-clock bombing of the communist logistical system. During daylight, the missions would be performed by propeller-driven and jet fighter-bombers and B-52s. At night, fixed-wing gunships would prowl for prey. The new effort would also be supported by aerial <b>defoliation</b> missions (Operation Ranch Hand) and the cloud-seeding weather modification effort known as Operation Popeye (see Ho Chi Minh Trail). On 15 November 1968 the Seventh Air Force was granted authorization for launch of Commando Hunt.|$|E
5|$|The typhoon first {{affected}} the Marshall Islands, where 5,000people became homeless and heavy crop damage was reported. The nation's capital of Majuro experienced power and water outages during the storm. There were no fatalities among Marshall Islands citizens, although the typhoon killed a sailor {{traveling around the}} world. When Gay struck Guam, it became the sixth typhoon {{of the year to}} affect the island. Most of the weaker structures had been destroyed during Typhoon Omar earlier in the year, resulting in little additional damage from Gay. Because of its substantial weakening, the typhoon had a disrupted inner-core and produced minimal rainfall. However, strong winds scorched the plants on Guam with saltwater, causing extensive <b>defoliation.</b> Further north, high waves from the typhoon destroyed a house on Saipan, and heavy rainfall in Okinawa, Japan, caused flooding and power outages.|$|E

25|$|Most cotton in the United States, Europe and Australia is {{harvested}} mechanically, {{either by}} a cotton picker, {{a machine that}} removes the cotton from the boll without damaging the cotton plant, or by a cotton stripper, which strips the entire boll off the plant. Cotton strippers are used in regions where it is too windy to grow picker varieties of cotton, and usually after application of a chemical defoliant or the natural <b>defoliation</b> that occurs after a freeze. Cotton is a perennial crop in the tropics, and without <b>defoliation</b> or freezing, the plant will continue to grow.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{permanently}} destroy the Iron Triangle as a Viet Cong stronghold, Operation Cedar Falls also entailed the complete deportation of the region's civilian population to so-called New Life Villages, the destruction of their homes, {{as well as the}} <b>defoliation</b> of whole areas.|$|E
25|$|Forest <b>defoliation</b> by {{the gypsy}} moths each year affects the populations and {{reproductive}} success of forest-dwelling birds. Nests placed in defoliated sites suffered a higher predation rate {{than those in}} non-defoliated sites. Gypsy moths have {{a direct impact on}} avian behavior in the American forests.|$|E
25|$|Greasy spot, a {{fungal disease}} {{caused by the}} Mycosphaerella citri, {{produces}} leaf spots and premature <b>defoliation,</b> thus reducing the tree's vigour and yield. Ascospores of M. citri are generated in pseudothecia in decomposing fallen leaves. Once mature, ascospores are ejected and subsequently dispersed by air currents.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the 834th {{supervised}} {{transport operations}} (primarily C-47's) of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force and six A-4 Wallaby transports {{operated by the}} Royal Australian Air Force 35 Squadron at Vũng Tàu Army Airfield. The 834th's flying components also performed <b>defoliation</b> missions, propaganda leaflet drops, and other special missions.|$|E
25|$|Japanese {{researchers}} performed {{tests on}} prisoners with Bubonic plague, cholera, smallpox, botulism, and other diseases. This research {{led to the}} development of the <b>defoliation</b> bacilli bomb and the flea bomb used to spread bubonic plague. Some of these bombs were designed with porcelain shells, an idea proposed by Ishii in 1938.|$|E
25|$|Herbicidal warfare {{research}} by the U.S. military began during the Second World War with additional research during the Korean War. Interest among military strategists waned before a budgetary increase allowed further research during the early Vietnam War. The U.S. research culminated in the U.S. military <b>defoliation</b> program during the Vietnam war known as Operation Ranch Hand.|$|E
25|$|Short-term dwarfing {{of foliage}} can be {{accomplished}} in certain deciduous bonsai by partial or total <b>defoliation</b> of the plant partway through the growing season. Not all species can survive this technique. In defoliating a healthy tree of a suitable species, {{most or all of}} the leaves are removed by clipping partway along each leaf's petiole (the thin stem that connects a leaf to its branch). Petioles later dry up and drop off or are manually removed once dry. The tree responds by producing a fresh crop of leaves. The new leaves are generally much smaller than those from the first crop, sometimes as small as half the length and width. If the bonsai is shown at this time, the smaller leaves contribute greatly to the bonsai aesthetic of dwarfing. This change in leaf size is usually not permanent, and the leaves of the following spring will often be the normal size. <b>Defoliation</b> weakens the tree and should not be performed in two consecutive years.|$|E
25|$|Stressed trees {{can also}} be {{attacked}} by psyllids {{to the point of}} <b>defoliation.</b> Grubs hatch from eggs laid on the edges of leaves and burrow into the leaf to suck nutrients, the tree's own latex shielding the insect. Caterpillars of the moth species Eustixis caminaea can strip trees of their leaves. The tree is also a host for the longhorn beetle species Agrianome spinicollis.|$|E
25|$|The <b>defoliation</b> {{of vital}} enemy strongholds, {{transportation}} routes, and crops forced the communists to vigorously defend against the spraying. Ranch Hand aircraft regularly received damage on missions—considering their low altitude, low speed and large size, they {{were easy to}} hit. Ranch Hand maintainers worked constantly {{to repair the damage}} and get their UC-123s ready for the next mission. In addition to engines and flight controls shot out, and several crewmen wounded and killed, Ranch Hand lost five UC-123s in combat between 1966 and 1968.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} an {{invasive}} species that has {{had a significant impact}} on the landscape is the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). The foliage-feeding gypsy moth is originally from temperate Eurasia; it was intentionally brought to the United States by an entomologist in 1869. Many specimens escaped from captivity and have since changed the ecology of deciduous and coniferous forests in North America by <b>defoliation.</b> This has led not only to the loss of wildlife habitat, but also other forest services, such as carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. After its initial introduction, the continued accidental transport of its larvae across North America has contributed to its population explosion.|$|E
25|$|The {{caterpillars}} {{are considered}} a problem when the larva population explodes in the spring. They can completely consume the foliage of a tree. Trees usually recover from this, refoliating within a month and resuming photosynthesis. Under most circumstances, little lasting damage is caused to the trees; however, the disappearance of foliage {{is considered to be}} an unattractive nuisance. On those rare occasions when infestations last for three years or more, tree mortality rates can become significant. Multiple outbreaks in Northern Ontario, Canada, in the 1990s resulted in over six consecutive years of aspen <b>defoliation</b> in some areas. One outbreak in upstate New York and Vermont began in 2002, with 650,000 acres (2600km²) defoliated in New York and 230,000 acres (930km²) in Vermont by 2005.|$|E
25|$|The autumn in Scania {{is a slow}} process, {{compared}} with more northern parts of Sweden (but a faster one, when comparing with {{any part of the}} British Isles). During the first half of September, temperatures usually are not so much affected, but the sunset is obviously earlier {{compared with}} in June. Temperatures drop in steps. Every new period with sunny weather becomes a bit cooler than the last one. By the end of October the <b>defoliation</b> process becomes evident. But not until late November all trees have lost their leaves. The period when storms and even hurricanes becomes most likely to occur durates between November and February. Most of them are coming from the Atlantic Ocean and doesn't involve snow or temperatures below freezing point. Late Scanian autumn is in general benefited from the surrounding waters (the opposite effect early spring).|$|E
25|$|The 'final solution' campaigns {{involved}} {{two primary}} tactics: The 'encirclement and annihilation' campaign involved bombing villages and mountain areas from aeroplanes, causing famine and <b>defoliation</b> of ground cover. When surviving villagers {{came down to}} lower-lying regions to surrender, the military would simply shoot them. Other survivors were placed in resettlement camps where they were prevented from travelling or cultivating farmland. In early 1978, the entire civilian population of Arsaibai village, near the Indonesian border, was killed for supporting Fretilin after being bombarded and starved. During this period, allegations of Indonesian use of chemical weapons arose, as villagers reported maggots appearing on crops after bombing attacks. The success of the 'encirclement and annihilation' campaign led to the 'final cleansing campaign', in which children and men from resettlement camps {{would be forced to}} hold hands and march in front of Indonesian units searching for Fretilin members. When Fretilin members were found, the members would be forced to surrender or to fire on their own people. The Indonesian 'encirclement and annihilation' campaign of 1977–1978 broke the back of the main Fretilin militia and the capable Timorese President and military commander, Nicolau Lobato, was shot and killed by helicopter-borne Indonesian troops on 31 December 1978.|$|E

500|$|Although Magda made {{landfall}} as {{a severe}} tropical cyclone, it struck a sparsely populated region. Rainfall peaked at [...] in Kuri Bay over a three-day span. Near where the storm made landfall, wind gusts were estimated up to 185km/h (115mph), resulting in significant <b>defoliation</b> and affecting a few structures. A few homes around Kuri Bay sustained roof damage, but no injuries were reported. Although damage {{in relation to}} Magda was limited, its name was retired following its usage and was later replaced with Megan.|$|E
500|$|In 1965, {{members of}} the U.S. Congress were told [...] "crop {{destruction}} is understood to be the more important purpose... but the emphasis is usually given to the jungle <b>defoliation</b> in public mention of the program." [...] Military personnel were told they were destroying crops because {{they were going to}} be used to feed guerrillas. They later discovered nearly all of the food they had been destroying was not being produced for guerrillas; it was, in reality, only being grown to support the local civilian population. For example, in Quang Ngai province, 85% of the crop lands were scheduled to be destroyed in 1970 alone. This contributed to widespread famine, leaving hundreds of thousands of people malnourished or starving.|$|E
500|$|Along the coast, rough seas {{spurred by}} the winds damaged docks and flooded some coastal regions. Offshore, waves reached heights of [...] near Arranmore. Dozens of ships were torn from their {{moorings}} and run aground at various ports, {{some of which were}} found [...] inland. In Salthill, three marinas were damaged with forty vessels damaged or sunk. Between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. local time, onshore winds from the storm caused the River Shannon to flow backwards and rise [...] Hundreds of acres of land, including potato and cabbage plots, were left several feet underwater. Many roads were submerged, making travel impossible in the area. The combination of strong winds and sea spray from the storm caused extensive <b>defoliation</b> of vegetation up to [...] inland. Spray from the River Foyle reportedly travelled [...]|$|E
500|$|During the Vietnam War, between 1962 and 1971, the United States {{military}} sprayed nearly [...] {{of various}} chemicals – the [...] "rainbow herbicides" [...] and defoliants – in Vietnam, eastern Laos, {{and parts of}} Cambodia {{as part of the}} aerial <b>defoliation</b> program known as Operation Ranch Hand, reaching its peak from 1967 to 1969. For comparison purposes, an olympic size pool holds approximately 660,000 U.S. gallons (2,500,000 L). As the British did in Malaya, the goal of the US was to defoliate rural/forested land, depriving guerrillas of food and concealment and clearing sensitive areas such as around base perimeters. The program was also a part of a general policy of forced draft urbanization, which aimed to destroy the ability of peasants to support themselves in the countryside, forcing them to flee to the U.S.-dominated cities, depriving the guerrillas of their rural support base.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} his tour as DCAS, Scherger was posted to Washington, D.C., {{to head up}} the Australian Joint Services Staff. Promoted to substantive air vice marshal, he became AOC of RAF Air Headquarters Malaya in January 1953. In this role, he commanded all Commonwealth air forces {{in the region and}} was responsible for operations against communist guerrillas during the emergency. Scherger deliberately sited his headquarters, which had been based in Singapore when he took over, next to the offices of the Director of Operations in Kuala Lumpur, to more closely align air tasking with overall military planning. He expanded the use of helicopters for troop delivery and casualty evacuation, and presided over a change in tactics that saw an earlier policy of indiscriminate saturation bombing of jungle areas replaced by one of precision strike against enemy camps. He also pioneered psychological warfare in the form of [...] "voice" [...] aircraft broadcasting propaganda, close cooperation between light aircraft spotters and ground forces to aid bombing missions, and <b>defoliation</b> to clear jungle cover.|$|E
500|$|The full-force of Monica's {{estimated}} [...] wind gusts were {{felt in the}} unpopulated tropical savanna {{regions of}} northern Australia. A large-scale windthrow event affected approximately 10,400km2 (4,000mi2) of forest, resulting in the damage or destruction of 140million trees. Damage extended [...] {{north and south of}} Monica's centre and progressed [...] inland. The affected areas primarily consist of Eucalyptus (namely E. miniata and E. tetrodonta) [...] and Corymbia (namely C. dichromophloia, C. latifolia, and C. foelscheana) tree species. Common grasses in the savanna area include Triodia bitextura and Sorghum. Areas near the cyclone's landfall point—Junction Bay—also comprise wetlands and Melaleuca swamp forests. The heaviest damage occurred just east of the landfall point, with more than 85percent of vegetation severely damaged; it spanned 139km2 (53.7mi2). In this area, trees were completely defoliated, snapped, and/or uprooted. Within [...] of Junction Bay, 77percent of all trees were uprooted or snapped at the trunk, while 84percent suffered total <b>defoliation.</b> In the Melaleuca swamps, 60percent of trees were snapped or uprooted once wind gusts exceeded [...] Approximately 12.7million tonnes of vegetative debris was created by the storm.|$|E
