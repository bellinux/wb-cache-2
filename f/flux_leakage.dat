40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a method of}} measuring axial magnetic <b>leakage</b> <b>flux</b> in an operational hydropower generator. Axial magnetic <b>leakage</b> <b>flux</b> is the magnetic flux {{at the ends of}} a rotating generator, which goes through the stator parallel to the rotor axis. This flux can cause circulating currents in the stator iron, giving rise to losses, and can in the worst case overheat a generator, causing it to melt down. To measure the axial flux, and how it affects the generator temperature, a measurement system was constructed on behalf of Vattenfall. The system consists of search coil sensors and a signal-processing unit with amplifiers and active filtering.   To confirm the behaviour of the axial <b>leakage</b> <b>flux</b> and the functionality of the measurement system, a test installation was made.

50|$|The ideal {{transformer}} model assumes that all flux {{generated by the}} primary winding links all the turns of every winding, including itself. In practice, some flux traverses paths that take it outside the windings. Such <b>flux</b> is termed <b>leakage</b> <b>flux,</b> and results in leakage inductance in series with the mutually coupled transformer windings. <b>Leakage</b> <b>flux</b> results in energy being alternately stored in and discharged from the magnetic fields with each cycle of the power supply. It is not directly a power loss, but results in inferior voltage regulation, causing the secondary voltage not to be directly proportional to the primary voltage, particularly under heavy load. Transformers are therefore normally designed to have very low leakage inductance.|$|R

50|$|Inline {{inspection}} pigs use various {{methods for}} inspecting a pipeline. A sizing pig uses one (or more) notched round metal plates as gauges. The notches allow {{different parts of}} the plate to bend when a bore restriction is encountered. More complex systems exist for inspecting various aspects of the pipeline. Intelligent pigs are used to inspect the pipeline with sensors and record the data for later analysis.

Intelligent pigs may also use calipers to measure the inside geometry of the pipeline.|$|E
50|$|Short-circuit {{inductance}} is the inductance {{when one}} of the primary winding or the secondary winding of the transformer is short-circuited and measured from the other winding. This value is often called informally as leakage inductance of the transformer. But the term leakage inductance which is in the electromagnetic literature is defined as an inductance caused by a magnetic <b>flux</b> (<b>leakage</b> flux) which is interlinked with one winding of a primary winding or a secondary winding and does not interlink with the other winding. So a confusion is caused by called short-circuit inductance as leakage inductance.　This symbol is Lsc or Lk.|$|E
5000|$|Half wave DC (HWDC, {{pulsating}} DC) works {{similar to}} full wave DC, but allows for detection of surface breaking indications {{and has more}} magnetic penetration into the part than FWDC. HWDC is advantageous for inspection process as it actually helps move the magnetic particles during the bathing of the test object. The aid in particle mobility {{is caused by the}} half-wave pulsating current waveform. In a typical mag pulse of 0.5 seconds there are 15 pulses of current using HWDC. This gives the particle more of an opportunity to come in contact with areas of magnetic <b>flux</b> <b>leakage.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Agulhas leakage to the South Atlantic ex-hibits {{a strong}} anti-correlation with the mass flux of the Agul-has Current. When the Agulhas retroflection {{is in its}} normal {{position}} near Cape Agulhas, leakage is relatively high and the nearby South African coastal slant (angle of derivation from zonal) is very small and relatively invariant alongshore. During periods of strong incoming <b>flux</b> (low <b>leakage),</b> the retroflection shifts upstream to Port Elizabeth or East Lon-don, where the coastline shape has a “kink”, i. e., the slant changes abruptly from small on the west side, to large (about 55 ◦) on the east side.

To do so, we develop a nonlinear analytical model fo...|$|R

5000|$|Magnetic <b>flux</b> <b>leakage</b> (،TFI) is a {{magnetic}} method of nondestructive testing {{that is used}} to detect corrosion and pitting in steel structures, most commonly pipelines and storage tanks. The basic principle is that a powerful magnet is used to magnetize the steel. At areas where there is corrosion or missing metal, the magnetic field [...] "leaks" [...] from the steel. In an MFL tool, {{a magnetic}} detector is placed between the poles of the magnet to detect the leakage field. Analysts interpret the chart recording of the leakage field to identify damaged areas and to estimate the depth of metal loss.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic <b>flux</b> <b>leakage</b> (MFL) tools use {{a sensor}} {{sandwiched}} between multiple powerful magnets {{to create and}} measure the flow of magnetic flux in the pipe wall. Structurally-sound steel has a uniform structure that allows regular flow of the magnetic flux, while anomalies and features interrupt the flow of flux in identifiable patterns; the sensor registers these flow interruptions and records them for later analysis. The following figure illustrates the principle of a typical MFL inspection tool; {{the left side of}} the diagram shows how an MFL tool works in structurally sound pipe, while the right side shows how the tool detects and measures a metal loss defect.|$|E
50|$|Toroidal cores {{are used}} despite the high {{manufacturing}} costs (a {{great deal of}} manual work) due to the low magnetic <b>flux</b> <b>leakage</b> (MFL - Leakage inductance), low core losses and the good power density. One possible quality feature of transformers is a uniform distribution of the windings along the circumference (low stray field). The insulation between the various windings can be solved quite differently. In case of covering windings, a film is applied after the first winding to achieve good stray field characteristics. This film needs to be wound to cover the whole circumference. For this, also toroidal winding machines with special magazines can be used.|$|E

Other [...] "smart" [...] pigs use electromagnetic acoustic transducers to detect pipe defects. Caliper pigs can measure the roundness of the pipeline to determine areas of crushing or other deformations.

50|$|Although {{the actual}} {{performance}} of a magnetic lock may differ substantially due to various losses (such as <b>flux</b> <b>leakage</b> between the electromagnet and the conductor), the equations give a good insight into {{what is necessary to}} produce a strong magnetic lock. For example, the force of the lock is proportional to the square of the relative permeability of the magnetic core. Given the relative permeability of a material can vary from around 250 for cobalt to around 5000 for soft iron and 7000 for silicon-iron, the choice of magnetic core can therefore have an important impact upon the strength of a magnetic lock. Also relevant is the choice of current, number of loops and effective length of the electromagnet.|$|E
50|$|The first rail {{inspections}} {{were done}} visually. Many sources cite {{that the need}} for better rail inspections came after a derailment at Manchester, New York, in 1911. That particular accident resulted in the death of 29 people and injuries to 60 others. The investigation of the accident revealed that the cause was a transverse fissure (a critical crack which lies perpendicular to the length of the rail) in the rail. Further investigation in the late 1920s showed that this type of defect was quite common. With increased rail traffic at higher speeds and with heavier axle loads today, critical crack sizes are shrinking and rail inspection is becoming more important. In 1927, Dr. Elmer Sperry built a massive rail inspection car under contract with the American Railway Association. Magnetic induction was the method used on the first rail inspection cars. This was done by passing large amounts of magnetic field through the rail and detecting <b>flux</b> <b>leakage</b> with search coils. Since then, many other inspection cars have traversed the rails in search of flaws.|$|E
40|$|A three-step {{labyrinth}} seal with 12, 11, and 10 labyrinth teeth per step, respectively, was tested under static (nonrotating) conditions. The configuration represented the seal for a high-performance turbopump (e. g., {{the space shuttle}} main engine fuel pump). The test data included critical mass flux and pressure profiles {{over a wide range}} of fluid conditions at concentric, partially eccentric, and fully eccentric seal positions. The seal mass <b>fluxes</b> (<b>leakage</b> rates) were lower over the entire range of fluid conditions tested than those for data collected for similar straight and three-step cylindrical seals, and this conformed somewhat to expectations. However, the pressure profiles for the eccentric positions indicated little, if any, direct stiffness for this configuration in contrast to significant direct stiffness reported for the straight and three-step cylindrical seals over the range of test conditions. Seal dynamics depend on geometric configuration, inlet and exit parameters, fluid phase, and rotation. The method of corresponding states was applied to the mass flux data, which were found to have a pressure dependency for helium...|$|R
