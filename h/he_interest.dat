6000|$|At {{first he}} could form no plan {{at all for}} doing that. He {{determined}} that research must still have his morning hours until lunch-time, and, he privately resolved, {{some part of the}} night. The rest of his day, he thought, he would set aside for a time to money-making. But he was altogether inexperienced in the methods of money-making; it was a new problem, and a new sort of problem to him altogether. He discovered himself helpless and rather silly in the matter. The more obvious possibilities seemed to be that he might lecture upon his science or write. He communicated with a couple of lecture agencies, and was amazed at their scepticism; no doubt he knew his science, on that point they were complimentary in a profuse, unconvincing manner, but could <b>he</b> <b>interest</b> like X--and here they named a notorious quack--could he draw? He offered Science Notes to a weekly periodical; the editor answered that for the purposes of his publication he preferred, as between professors and journalists, journalists. [...] "You real scientific men," [...] he said, [...] "are no doubt a thousand times more accurate and novel and all that, but as no one seems able to understand you----" [...] He went to his old fellow-student, Gwenn, who was editing The Scientific Review, and through him he secured some semi-popular lectures, which involved, he found, travelling about twenty-nine miles weekly at the rate of four-and-sixpence a mile--counting nothing for the lectures. Afterwards Gwenn arranged for some regular notes on physics and micro-chemistry. Trafford made out a weekly time-table, on whose white of dignity, leisure, and the honourable pursuit of knowledge, a diaper of red marked the claims of domestic necessity.|$|E

[...] "She never rested herself all day," [...] said Mrs. Hopkins, [...] "till I thought she would sink from very weariness." [...] She had gone into every room and opened every drawer, and had had every piece of plate through her fingers, and then Mrs. Hopkins told him that just as she was departing she had said that the keys would be given to the lawyer. After that he wandered about the place, thinking what his life would be should he find himself the owner of Bragton. At this moment he almost felt that he disliked the place, though there had been times in which he had thought that he loved it too well. Of one thing he was conscious,--that if Bragton should become his, it would be his duty to live there. He must move his books, and pipes, and other household gods from Hoppet Hall and become an English Squire. Would it be too late for him to learn to ride to hounds? Would it be possible that he should ever succeed in shooting a pheasant, if he were to study the art patiently? Could <b>he</b> <b>interest</b> himself as to the prevalence or decadence of ground game? And what must he do with his neighbours?

Furthermore, both money aggregates are cointegrated with real GNP, exports and <b>he</b> <b>interest</b> rate at the zero frequency.

40|$|Car {{ownership}} is lower in urban areas, {{which is probably}} related to the availability of better public transport. Better public transport thus may offer the possibility to relieve the many problems (congestion, health, and parking) associated {{with the presence of}} cars in urban areas. To investigate this issue, we develop and estimate a model for the simultaneous choice of a residential area and car ownership. The model is estimated on Danish register data for single-earner and dual-earners households in the greater Copenhagen metropolitan area. We pay special attention to accessibility of the metro network which offers particularly high quality public transport. Simulations based on the estimated model show that for the greater Copenhagen area a planned extension of the metro network decreases car ownership by 2 - 3 %. Our results suggest also a substantial increase in t <b>he</b> <b>interest</b> for living in areas close to the metro network, that affects the demographic composition of neighbourhoods...|$|E

40|$|X <b>he</b> <b>interest</b> in {{preventive}} psychiatry {{was given}} a great fillip {{with the advent of}} the Community Psychiatry movement in the U. S. A. in the early sixties. Caplan (1964) saw primary prevention as an essentially public health concept. It aims at reducing the incidence (occurrence of fresh or new cases) of psychiatric disorders of all types in a community and at promoting mental health among its members. He admitted that few of the principles enunciated in the pages of his book on Prentive Psychiatry (Caplan, 1964) were based on solid research findings or even on consensus among experts. He conceded that no organised programme for prevention of specific mental disorders existed and the necessarry knowledge for that purpose was lacking. He did hope however, that epidemiological and other types of aetiological research as well as evaluative study of the effects of differing methods on a variety of disorders will one day make this posible. Today 37 th year later, Caplan's hope still remains largely unrealised. In fact, for a long time after Caplan's formulation of the principLes and practice of Primary Prevention in Psychiatry, there was considerable lack of activity in the field till 1978.

40|$|This {{conceptual}} paper {{discusses the}} role communication plays in creating and maintaining learning organizations. A continuum ranging from Rational Choice Theory to Social Exchange Theory is proposed for relationship interac-tions. These relation-based interactions are effective for organizations exposed to conditions of instability and complexity. Attention {{is given to}} the communica-tion embedded in the preconditions necessary for developing learning organiza-tions (trust, commitment, perceived organizational support), in the indicators needed for preparing for this state (organization-employee relationship, valuing the employee, employee empowerment, and employee ownership and acceptance of responsibility) and in what Senge refers to as the five disciplines of learning organizations (systems thinking, personal mastery, mental models, building a shared vision, and team learning). An organizational case study using commu-nication and relationships to create and maintain a learning organization is presented. Implications and conclusions are discussed. It is no accident that most organizations learn poorly. The way they are designed and managed, the way people’s jobs are defined, and, most impor-tant, the way we have been taught to think and interact (not only in orga-nizations but more broadly) create fundamental learning disabilities.

40|$|The {{development}} of small-scale quantum devices {{raises the question}} of how to fairly assess and detect quantum speedup. Here, we show how to define and measure quantum speedup and how to avoid pitfalls that might mask or fake such a speedup. We illustrate our discussion with data from tests run on a D-Wave Two device with up to 503 qubits. By using random spin glass instances as a benchmark, we found no evidence of quantum speedup when the entire data set is considered and obtained inconclusive results when comparing subsets of instances on an instance-by-instance basis. Our results do not rule out the possibility of speedup for other classes of problems and illustrate the subtle nature of the quantum speedup question. T <b>he</b> <b>interest</b> in quantum computing origi-nates in the potential of a quantum comput-er to solve certain computational problems much faster than is possible classically. Ex-amples are the factoring of integers (1) and the simulation of quantum systems (2, 3). In these examples, a quantum algorithm is exponentially faster than the best known classical algorithm. According to the extended Church-Turing thesis, all classical computers are equivalent up to poly-nomial factors (4). Similarly, all proposedmodels of quantum computation are polynomially equiv-alent, so that a finding of exponential quantum speedup will be model-independent. In other cases, in particular on small devices or when the quantum speedup is polynomial, defining and de-tecting quantum speedup becomes more subtle. Denoting the time used by a specific classical device or algorithm to solve a problem of size N by C(N) and the time used on the quantum de-vice by Q(N), we define quantum speedup as the asymptotic behavior of the rati...|$|E
