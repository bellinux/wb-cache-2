40|$|From the {{prospect}} of the high average current elec-tron injectors, the most important advantage of the field-emission cathodes is their capability to generate very large current densities. Simulation of field-emission cathodes is complicated by the large range of spatial dimensions: from sub-micron scale, for a single field-emission tip, to mil-limeter scale, for a field-emitter array. To overcome this simulation challenge our numerical model is split in two steps. During the first step, only electrons emitted by a sin-gle tip are considered. In the second step, the beams origi-nating from many single emitting tips are merged together to mimic the field-emitter array configuration.

In the present work, this "magnetically-dead" silicide (where strong spin-scattering significantly reduces injected spin polarization) is eliminated by moving the FM in the spin injector from the tunnel junction base anode to the <b>emitter</b> <b>cathode</b> and away from the silicon surface. This results in over an order-of-magnitude increase in spin injection efficiency, from a previously-reported magnetocurrent ratio of ~ 2 % to ~ 35 % and an estimated spin polarization in Si from ~ 1 % to at least ~ 15 %. The injector tunnel-junction bias dependence of this spin transport signal is also measured, demonstrating the importance of low bias voltage to preserve high injected spin polarization...|$|E

Field emission devices are usually prepared with semiconductor micro-fabrication techniques, and include an emitter with a sharp point to concentrate the applied electric field to values greater than 109 V/m in order to stimulate electron emission. In such devices there is a gate or grid spaced between the <b>emitter</b> (<b>cathode)</b> and a collector (anode).

Achievement of this goal required supporting studies in cathode fabrication, cathode performance, gun design, cathode mounting and gun fabrication. A series of empirical investigations advanced fabrication technology: More stable emitters were produced and multiple cone failure caused by chain reaction discharges were reduced. The cathode is capable of producing well over 95 mA, but a substantial collector development effort was required to demonstrate emission levels in the 100 mA region. Space charge problems made these levels difficult to achieve. Recommendations are made for future process and materials investigation. Electron gun designs were modeled and tested.

In this paper we present two concepts of field <b>emitter</b> <b>cathodes</b> which could potentially produce low emittance beam. The first challenging parameter for such cathode is to emit peak current as high as 5 A. This is the minimum current requirement for the XFEL concept from Paul Scherrer Institut. 1 Maximum current of 0. 12 A and 0. 58 A have been reached respectively with field emitter arrays (FEA) and single needle cathodes.

The multipole discharge chamber investigated was shown capable of low discharge chamber losses and flat ion beam profiles {{with a minimum of}} optimization. Minimum discharge losses were 200 to 250 eV/ion for xenon and 300 to 350 eV/ion for argon, while flatness parameters in the plane of the accelerator grid were 0. 85 to 0. 95. The design used employs low magnetic field strengths, which permits the use of sheet-metal parts. The corner problem of the discharge chamber was resolved with recessed corner anodes, which approximately equalized both the magnetic field above the anodes and the electron currents to these anodes.

40|$|The primary {{problem with}} Hall plasma {{accelerator}} operation on oxygen is poor cathode performance and short lifetime. The primary problem with micro Hall thrusters {{is the absence}} of a stable low power cathode. Cathodes traditionally used for both applications employ thermionic emitters which are not efficient and which are easily oxidized in an oxygen-rich environment. The field <b>emitter</b> <b>cathode</b> presented in this report has the potential of filling both vacancies since it does not require a high-power heater and can be scaled down with the size of the thruster. The advantages to using Hf and HfC as emitting materials are low work functions and high resistance to oxygen poisoning. Preliminary investigations proved that HfC emitters can operate in 7. 6 mTorr oxygen pressure environments. The initial cathode design employs an electrostatic lens that also acts as an ion filter to prevent thruster ions from bombarding the field emitters while decelerating the electron beam and keeping it focused to ensure efficient performance.

40|$|Advances of {{elemental}} analysis in geology {{are defined by}} the development and improvement ofphysical, instrumental methods of chemical analysis. New instrumental methods - emission spectrometry and mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP) sources {{are the most popular}} in the area of {{elemental analysis}} in recent years. These methods have a very high sensitivity and wide range of elements analyzed (up to 70 items at a time). Both of these methods have been developed and demonstrate their high analytical performance only when analyzing liquids. Consequently, when using these methods in geology, solid samples must be completely transferred into liquid. This complicates the analysis, especially in the analysis of sparingly soluble objects. In some cases, analyzed geological objects are generally insoluble in acids and other solvents (e. g. such as black shales are not dissolved till the end in any acids). Naturally, {{there is a need to}} develop an analytical method, wherein the step of dissolution of the sample can be avoided. Such instrumental methods exist but are not used because of low sensitivity. Method of glow discharge mass spectrometry has the greatest potential today, but its use is hampered by lack of a recognized certified ion source capable of converting analyzed (in most cases - not conductive) geological sample into low-temperature plasma. In this paper, the glow discharge source on the basis of the hollow cathode is used as an external source. The hollow cathode has been long and successfully used in analytical practice in emission spectral analysis. However, for use in mass spectrometry, its design has been considerably modified. The analyzed sample, which was formerly in the form of powder or fine particles located at the bottom of the hollow cathode, in a new cathode is installed as a rod along the axis of the inner cathode cavity - it is the emitter of sputtered neutral particles. Hollow cathode source is set on the high resolution mass - spectrometer of ELEMENT 2 type instead of the ICP source. In sample preparation a geological sample is transformed into ultrafine state (particle size of about one micron), this thin layer of powder is applied to the emitter. Particles are held on the <b>emitter</b> (<b>cathode)</b> by van der Waals and electrostatic forces, are bombarded with argon ions, they can be also effected by electrostatic forces - between the emitter and the anode voltage of several hundred volts is applied. As a result, the charged ultra-disperse particles break away from the - emitter and diffuse into the glow discharge. Getting into the negative glow particles are heated by the electron current, then evaporate and ionize. The low-temperature plasma is formed. Mass spectral line of each element consists of many individual spikes lasting 10 - 30 msec. Each spike is the result of evaporation and ionization of individual particles. Mass spectral lines can be smoothed in the summation series of mass spectra. The proposed method allows direct analysis of geological samples with sensitivity ppb or less without dissolving the sample, without concentration of impurities...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{thesis is}} {{focusing}} on a study of junction effect transistors (JFETs) in compact pulsed power applications. Pulsed power usually requires switches with high hold-off voltage, high current, low forward voltage drop, and fast switching speed. 4 H-SiC, with a bandgap of 3. 26 eV (The bandgap of Si is 1. 12 eV) and other physical and electrical superior properties, has gained much attention in high power, high temperature and high frequency applications. One topic of this thesis is to evaluate if 4 H-SiC JFETs have a potential to replace gas phase switches to make pulsed power system compact and portable. Some other pulsed power applications require cathodes of providing stable, uniform, high electron-beam current. So the other topic {{of this research is}} to evaluate if Si JFET-controlled carbon nanotube field emitter cold cathode will provide the necessary e-beam source.; In the topic of " 4 H-SiC JFETs", it focuses on the design and simulation of a novel 4 H-SiC normally-off VJFET with high breakdown voltage using the 2 -D simulator ATLAS. To ensure realistic simulations, we utilized reasonable physical models and the established parameters as the input into these models. The influence of key design parameters were investigated which would extend pulsed power limitations. After optimizing the key design parameters, with a 50 -&# 956;m drift region, the predicted breakdown voltage for the VJFET is above 8 kV at a leakage current of 1 × 10 - 5 A/cm 2. The specific on-state resistance is 35 m[omega]·cm 2 at VGS = 2. 7 V, and the switching speed is several ns. The simulation results suggest that the 4 H-SiC VJFET is a potential candidate for improving switching performance in repetitive pulsed power applications. To evaluate the 4 H-SiC VJFETs in pulsed power circuits, we extracted some circuit model parameters from the simulated I-V curves. Those parameters are necessary for circuit simulation program such as SPICE. This method {{could be used as a}} test bench without fabricating the devices to minimize the unnecessary cost.; As an extended research of 4 H-SiC devices, Metal-Insulator-SiC (MIS) structures were utilized to evaluate the high dielectric constant materials [...] TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3, as possible gate dielectrics for SiC devices. TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 were chosen because of their high dielectric constants and bandgap energies as well as the acceptance of Ti and Al in most modern CMOS fabrication facilities. MIS devices were fabricated and both their I-V and C-V characteristics were measured and discussed. Our research showed that Al 2 O 3 deposited by e-beam evaporation could be considered as a promising material among the gate insulators for high power SiC devices.; In the topic of "Si JFET-controlled carbon nanotube field <b>emitter</b> <b>cathode</b> arrays", stability, controllability and lifetime are the main issues waiting to be addressed before field emitters find their wide applications. The ideas of connecting Si or metal field emitters with external MOSFETs or built-in active devices were attempted by other researchers, and those devices showed effectiveness in controlling and stabilizing the emission current. We presented the design, simulation, and the fabrication of Si JFETs monolithically integrated with CNTs field emitters. The Si JFET was designed to control and improve the emission of carbon nanotube field emitter arrays. Its electrical characteristics were simulated by the device simulator ATLAS. The fabrication process was developed to be compatible with the last step of growing multiwalled carbon nanotubes at 700 ºC. Carbon nanotubes field emitters were grown by PECVD (Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition). Preliminary field emission tests were conducted with 50 × 50 emitter arrays, with a resultant emission current of 3 [nano]A (~ 40 mA/cm 2) at an extraction gate voltage of 50 V and an anode voltage of 300 V.
