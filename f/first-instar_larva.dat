25|$|To grow, the larva must molt. Larva are {{characterized}} by the term instar, which refers {{to the number of}} times a larva has molted; a <b>first-instar</b> <b>larva</b> has not yet molted, a second instar has molted once, a third instar twice, etc. Males typically are five instars and females are six instars. When the larvae reach the fourth instar, they become nocturnal feeders, and will return to their resting places at dawn, hiding under flaps of bark, in crevices, or under branches - any place that provides protection.|$|E
25|$|The female lays {{an average}} of 210 eggs and a {{recorded}} maximum of 368 eggs near fresh corpses and often during daylight hours. After the eggs have been laid, the <b>first-instar</b> <b>larva</b> of the insect emerges from the egg about 26 hours later at a temperature of 29°C. A total of three larval instars {{are involved in the}} lifecycle of the species, and the entire larval development stage takes 2.5 days at a temperature of 29°C. The larvae are capable of regulating their body temperature by moving to a different position in the maggot mass to maintain a preferred developmental temperature. The maximal preferential temperature for the larvae of C. rufifacies is 35.1°C. The developmental time of the species is highly dependent upon temperature due to the cold-blooded nature of insects and the number of accumulated degree days. Any variability in developmental times can also be due to different rearing temperatures under different conditions such as varying humidity, rearing media, and larval density.|$|E

25|$|The {{life cycle}} of Sarcophaga bullata is {{characterized}} by holometabolous development, though, like all known sarcophagids, the species is larviparous, meaning that the egg develops internally and females then give birth to <b>first-instar</b> <b>larvae.</b> This must be accounted for when using the species in forensic work to calculate a post-mortem interval.|$|R
50|$|The larvae {{feed on the}} flowers, {{fruits and}} leaves of Ligustrum species, {{including}} Ligustrum japonicum and Ligustrum lucidum.

50|$|To grow, the larva must molt.

50|$|The egg chorion splits {{along its}} spinacular line, {{a process called}} eclosion, {{resulting}} in the emerging larva breathing air and ingesting chorionic fluid. This larva {{is referred to as}} the <b>first-instar</b> <b>larva</b> and then enters ecdysis, which occurs between roughly 16 and 24 hours after the chorion has split, and transition into the second-instar larval stage. The second-instar larva feeds between 12.85 and 25.45 hours before molting and entering the third-instar larval stage. The third-instar larva then molts into a fourth-instar larval stage. In the final stage, the fifth-instar larval stage, the larva eats and defecates up into the start of cocoon formation.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Picea, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Tsuga, Abies and Pinus contorta. They {{generally}} {{feed on the}} cones {{of their}} host plant, but are occasionally also found on shoots and needles. Larvae of the spruce budworm sometimes cause superficial damage on cones, but their effect on the seed crop is minimal (Ives and Wong 1988), at least in central Canada. Capable of causing less than 10% of a seed crop, the larvae of the cone cochylid (Henricus fuscodorsana Kearfott) feed in the cones, damaging scales and seed (Hedlin et al. 1980). The species overwinters as a <b>first-instar</b> <b>larva.</b> Pupation takes place in late June and early July.|$|E

5000|$|Another feature {{shared by}} the Eucharitidae and Perilampidae is the <b>first-instar</b> <b>larvae</b> are called [...] "planidia" [...] and are {{responsible}} for gaining access to the host, rather than the egg-laying females.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study was conducted}} on the influence of temperature, air relative humidity and water presence on some biological parameters of Clavigralla tomentosicollis Stal, a major pest of cowpea, Vigna unguiculata Walpers, in West Africa. The feeding of the <b>first-instar</b> <b>larvae</b> was also studied. The aim was to provide some indicators on the insect adaptation to hot and dry conditions in Sahelian zone. Results show that increased temperature reduced embryo and larvae development length and female fertility and lifespan. Temperature fluctuations had little effect on egg viability to the extent of hatching limit around 38 ° C. A full larval development and adult reproductive activity were possible at a constant temperature of 40 ° C. Increased air relative humidity (80 %) improved larval survival especially under high temperatures. The presence of water was necessary for <b>first-instar</b> <b>larvae</b> development.

50|$|In {{spring the}} eggs hatch {{in the bag}} in which the adult female had grown. Because the female never leaves the tree in which she grew and died, the insects need some other way to move to new trees or in general to disperse, {{and in fact the}} newly hatched (<b>first-instar)</b> <b>larva</b> is the {{dispersive}} stage of the wattle bagworm life cycle. The larva spins a silken thread on which it may float along on the breeze, much as some species of young spiderlings use gossamer for ballooning in their dispersive phase. Also, birds and probably other agencies may carry some larvae to suitable feeding sites. The young caterpillar does not feed {{for a day or two}} after hatching, but eventually, once the dispersive phase is completed, it begins to weave a conical bag of silk, incorporating fragments of plant material such as leaves, twigs and bark.|$|E
50|$|As far as is known, all Acroceridae are parasitoids of spiders. They {{are most}} {{commonly}} collected when a spider {{from the field}} is brought into captivity. As in the related families, Bombyliidae and Nemestrinidae, {{members of the family}} undergo hypermetamorphosis; the adults do not seek out their hosts; instead, the <b>first-instar</b> <b>larva</b> is a planidium. Females lay large number of eggs, up to 5,000, and after hatching, the planidia seek out spiders. They do not resemble the triungulin of most beetles with a hypermetamorphosis, but do resemble the triungulin of Stylops. The larva can move with a looping movement like a leech or inchworm, and can leap several millimetres into the air. When a spider contacts an acrocerid planidium, the planidium grabs hold, crawls up the spider's legs to its body, and forces its way through the body wall, usually at an articulation membrane. Often, it lodges near a book lung, where it may remain for years before completing its development. Mature larvae pupate outside the host.|$|E

40|$|Transgenesis of most insects {{currently}} {{relies on}} fluorescence markers. Here we establish a transformation marker system causing phenotypes {{visible to the}} naked eye due to changes in the color of melanin pigments, which are widespread in animals. Ubiquitous overexpression of arylalkylamine-N-acetyl transferase in the silkworm, Bombyx mori, changes the color of newly hatched <b>first-instar</b> <b>larvae</b> from black to a distinctive light brown color, and can be used as a molecular marker by directly connecting to baculovirus immediate early 1 gene promoter. Suppression of black pigmentation by Bm-arylalkylamine-N-acetyl transferase can be observed throughout the larval stages and in adult animals. Alternatively, overexpression in another gene, B. mori b-alanyl-dopamine synthetase (Bm-ebony), changes the larval body color of older instars, although <b>first-instar</b> <b>larvae</b> had normal dark coloration. We further show that ectopic Bm-arylalkylamine-N-acetyl transferase expression lightens coloration in ladybird beetle Harmonia axyridis and fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, highlighting the potential use-fulness of this marker for transgenesis in diverse insect taxa...|$|R
50|$|Polistes carnifex wasps are parasitized by strepsipteran {{insects in}} the genus Xenos.

5000|$|The aphid soldier {{exhibits}} {{its first}} distinguishing physical traits {{as a first}} larval instar, the phase following its complete maturation in the egg.

Monomorphic <b>first-instar</b> <b>larvae</b> of Pemphigus dorocola attack moth larvae, a predator, when it is experimentally introduced to the gall. After observing a physical resemblance between these aphids and the thick-legged P. spyrothecae larvae, Aoki suggested that these insects also defended the gall. His prediction was confirmed, as he later observed a caste between normal-legged <b>first-instar</b> <b>larvae</b> as “reproductives-to-be” and the thick-legged larvae as defenders, or in his words, “soldiers." [...] This was later deemed the first discovery of aphid soldiers from a locality outside of East Asia. These soldiers have different morphological states from other members of the species. First, the first-instar soldiers tend to be more aggressive. They also have thick hind legs and a stylet, which is used to attack invaders.|$|R
