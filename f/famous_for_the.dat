5|$|Ebla {{maintained}} its prosperity through a vast trading network. Artifacts from Sumer, Cyprus, Egypt {{and as far}} as Afghanistan were recovered from the city's palaces. The kingdom had its own language, Eblaite and the political organization of Ebla had features different from the Sumerian model.

5|$|Elizabeth's reign {{is known}} as the Elizabethan era. The period is <b>famous</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> flourishing of English drama, led by playwrights such as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe, and for the {{seafaring}} prowess of English adventurers such as Francis Drake. Some historians depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered, sometimes indecisive ruler, who enjoyed more than her share of luck. Towards the end of her reign, a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity. Elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer and a dogged survivor in an era when government was ramshackle and limited, and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones. Such was the case with Elizabeth's rival, Mary, Queen of Scots, whom she imprisoned in 1568 and had executed in 1587. After the short reigns of Elizabeth's half-siblings, her 44 years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped forge a sense of national identity.|$|E
