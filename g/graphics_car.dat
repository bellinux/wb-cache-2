40|$|In Australia {{road safety}} {{advertising}} often highlights {{the consequences of}} risky driving through the portrayal of <b>graphic</b> <b>car</b> crash scenes. Many health promotion researchers have cautioned that employing these types of messages may be ineffective and lead to defensive responses such as avoidance, particularly where efficacy perceptions are low. Identifying road outcomes characterised by high perceived control in populations may be crucial to overcoming avoidance and consequently aid {{in the creation of}} effective messages. However, such hypotheses are rarely examined. The present study employed a within subjects design where community participants (n = 228) read information highlighting the risks of dangerous driving. The information portrayed risky behaviour leading to road crash and legal sanction outcomes in two separate essays. The delivery of the information was counterbalanced and recall for each message was measured using surprise recall tasks. Perceptions of risk and efficacy were also assessed for both outcomes. Results demonstrated that threat and efficacy appraisals were independently related to recall of the legal sanction information. Specifically, increases in threat and efficacy were related to increases in recall. No such relationships were demonstrated for the crash outcome information. These findings suggest that the identification of controllable outcomes may be the key to overcoming avoidance of threatening road safety advertisements. Results are discussed in light of current fear appeal theory and best practice health promotion in road safety...|$|R

40|$|The {{necessity}} of accurate channel estimation for coherent multiuser detectors is well known. Indeed {{they are based}} on the assumption that signals are perfectly estimated, and this is never completely achieved in practice. Furthermore, practical transmitters and receivers are affected by many non-idealities like strong phase noise, and thus the task of channel estimation is all the more challenging. Another notorious issue is the high computational complexity of multiuser techniques. This project has devoted significant attention for massively parallel receiver architectures and the possibility to parallelize channel estimation algorithms. Nvidia CUDA graphic cards are especially well-suited to address problems that can be expressed as data parallel computations. This task is very challenging and ambitious, since the usage of such cards for receiver design is still at its infant stage. This thesis describes the work carried out at German Aerospace Center (DLR) where a real-world multiuser detector is studied. The desired goals were the following: fine tuning of the already existing channel estimation algorithm; exploration of the factor graph approach in order to improve the estimation quality and to develop algorithms suitable to be parallelized; parallel implementation of the algorithms on CUDA graphic card. All these points have been covered. Two different improvements for the already implemented phase estimator are proposed. Both are based on the same approximation of the Wiener-Levy phase model and assume the same knowledge at the receiver. By adopting the factor graph approach, we present two existing algorithms for the phase estimation in a new parallel fashion and we show that, at the same time, they improve the estimation quality, and they are suitable to be parallelized on the board. The performance improvement for all estimators proposed in terms of Mean Square Error are validated through several simulation campaigns carried out in different scenarios, most of them characterized by strong phase noise and low signal-to-noise ratios. Finally we present several parallel phase estimation algorithms working on CUDA graphic card and we show that, in some cases, we are in presence of a massive parallelization in which is achieved a speedup more than 200 times compared to the serial implementation. The results obtained represent a starting point for the implementation of a Parallel Iterative Receiver to be inserted in the existing multiuser detector and completely executed on CUDA <b>graphic</b> <b>car...</b>|$|R

40|$|Racing {{car design}} using Knowledge Aided Engineering CAD systems and related {{technologies}} evolution has improved {{the development of}} software for automatic configuration of mechanical systems. This happened {{with the introduction of}} KAE systems that enable computer to support the designer during the decision making process. This paper presents a knowledge-based application that allows the designer to automatically compute and evaluate mass properties of racing cars (IRL Dallara). The system is made by two main components: the computing core, which determines the car model, and the graphic user interface, which makes the system usable also by non-programmers. The computing core creates the model of the car based on a tree structure, which contains all car subsystems (e. g., suspension and chassis). Different part-subpart relationships define tree model and link an object (e. g., suspension) to its components (e. g., wishbones and wheel). Independent parameters (including design variables) and relationships definition allows the model to configure itself evaluating all properties (dimensional, positional, mass, etc.). The graphic user interface allows the end user to interact with the car model editing independent design parameters. It visualises principal outputs of the model, which consist of numeric data (mass, centre of mass of the car and of its subsystems) and <b>graphic</b> elements (<b>car</b> and subsystems 3 D representation) ...|$|R
