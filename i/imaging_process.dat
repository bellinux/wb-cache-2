MARDI was built by Malin Space Science Systems, and it is the lightest and most efficient camera ever to land on Mars.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose to jointly detect lane and {{pavement}} boundaries by fusing information from both optical and radar images acquired with the sensor system mounted {{on the top of}} the host vehicle. The boundaries are described with concentric circular models. The optical and radar <b>imaging</b> <b>processes</b> are modeled as Gaussian and log-normal probability densities. The multisensor fusion boundary detection problem is posed in a Bayesian framework and a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate is employed to locate the lane and pavement boundaries. Since the circular model parameters possess compatible units and are in the same order of magnitude, the estimation problem is much better conditioned than using the previous parabolic models, whose parameters are incompatible with each other. This fusion algorithm achieves analytical integration of two different sensing modalities due to the validation of the likelihoods that describe both optical and radar <b>imaging</b> <b>processes.</b> Experimental results have shown that the fusion algorithm outperforms single sensor based boundary detection algorithms in a variety of road scenarios.
