25|$|These {{are used}} for {{high-temperature}} Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (nearly 340nbsp&°C) to produce low-molecular-weight unsaturated hydrocarbons on alkalized fused iron catalysts. The fluid-bed technology (as adapted from the catalytic cracking of heavy petroleum distillates) was introduced by Hydrocarbon Research in 1946–50 and named the ‘Hydrocol’ process. A large scale Fischer–Tropsch Hydrocol plant (350,000 tons per annum) operated during 1951–57 in Brownsville, Texas. Due to technical problems, and lacking economy due to increasing petroleum availability, this development was discontinued. Fluid-bed Fischer–Tropsch synthesis has recently been very successfully reinvestigated by Sasol. One reactor with a capacity of 500,000 tons per annum is now in operation and even larger ones are being built (nearly 850,000 tons per annum). The process is now used mainly for C2 and C7 alkene production. This new development {{can be regarded as}} an important progress in Fischer–Tropsch technology. A high-temperature process with a circulating iron catalyst (‘circulating fluid bed’, ‘riser reactor’, ‘entrained catalyst process’) was introduced by the Kellogg Company and a respective plant built at Sasol in 1956. It was improved by Sasol for successful operation. At Secunda, South Africa, Sasol operated 16 advanced reactors of this type with a capacity of approximately 330,000 tons per annum each. Now the circulating catalyst process is being replaced by the superior Sasol-advanced fluid-bed technology. Early experiments with cobalt catalyst particles suspended in oil have been performed by Fischer. The bubble column reactor with a powdered iron slurry catalyst and a CO-rich syngas was particularly developed to pilot plant scale by Kölbel at the Rheinpreuben Company in 1953. Recently (since 1990) low-temperature Fischer–Tropsch slurry processes are under investigation for the use of iron and cobalt catalysts, particularly for the production of a hydrocarbon wax, or to be <b>hydrocracked</b> and isomerised to produce diesel fuel, by Exxon and Sasol. Today slurry-phase (bubble column) low-temperature Fischer–Tropsch synthesis is regarded by many authors as the most efficient process for Fischer–Tropsch clean diesel production. This Fischer–Tropsch technology is also under development by the Statoil Company (Norway) for use on a vessel to convert associated gas at offshore oil fields into a hydrocarbon liquid.|$|E

The working catalyst is only obtained when—after reduction with hydrogen—in the initial period of synthesis several iron carbide phases and elemental carbon are formed whereas iron oxides are still present in addition to some metallic iron. With iron catalysts two directions of selectivity have been pursued. One direction has aimed at a low-molecular-weight olefinic hydrocarbon mixture to be produced in an entrained phase or fluid bed process (Sasol–Synthol process). Due to the relatively high reaction temperature (approx. 340nbsp&°C), the average molecular weight of the product is so low that no liquid product phase occurs under reaction conditions. The catalyst particles moving around in the reactor are small (particle diameter 100nbsp&µm) and carbon deposition on the catalyst does not disturb reactor operation. Thus a low catalyst porosity with small pore diameters as obtained from fused magnetite (plus promoters) after reduction with hydrogen is appropriate. For maximising the overall gasoline yield, C3 and C4 alkenes have been oligomerized at Sasol.

The conversion of normal long chain paraffins from the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to clean distillate fuels is a particular area of interest. The objective of this project is to investigate the <b>hydrocracking</b> of long chain paraffins under F-T conditions. The aim is to achieve in situ, the <b>hydrocracking</b> of low temperature Cobalt-based F-T wax by combining F-T synthesis and <b>hydrocracking</b> in a single reactor. For the purpose of this thesis, it involves subjecting the <b>hydrocracking</b> catalyst to F-T conditions. Synthesis gas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen), the paraffin n-C 16 and water were co-currently fed to a fixed-bed reactor containing only the <b>hydrocracking</b> catalyst. Therefore care was taken to match the experimental conditions of the <b>hydrocracking</b> experiments to those that prevail in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Practically this means the <b>hydrocracking</b> of n-hexadecane was studied at the space velocity, the reaction temperature and pressure and under partial pressure of H 2, CO and water, at which n-hexadecane is produced in F-T process assuming that n-hexadecane is the only hydrocarbon product and that n-hexadecane is a model compound for the low temperature F-T process. The results of this investigation show that the <b>hydrocracking</b> reaction over a Pd catalyst supported on H-MFI Zeolite under F-T conditions is non-ideal. At low feed (n-C 16) conversions, product distributions are strongly dominated by secondary reactions. The ability of the metal site is significantly inhibited by the presence of CO and water. The product distributions show exactly this due to the increase in unsaturated and more branched species. Feed conversion in the presence of water and CO increase with increasing reaction temperature. The absence of methane in the product spectrum is an indication that the hydrogenolysis reaction is an unfavorable pathway for the catalyst used.

The Fischer-Tropsch wax {{synthesis}} {{process and}} the subsequent upgrade of the wax to useful distillate fuels by mild <b>hydrocracking</b> is a well-known, economically viable method of producing liquid fuels, in particular diesel fuel. This project seeks to develop an ideal <b>hydrocracking</b> catalyst (i. e. a <b>hydrocracking</b> unit in which only primary cracking occurs) for the conversion of Fischer-Tropsch (FT) wax to diesel and {{to determine the effect}} of carbon monoxide on the activity and selectivity of the <b>hydrocracking</b> catalyst for possible integration of low temperature FT wax synthesis with wax <b>hydrocracking</b> into a single stage. Theoretically, a combination of the Fischer-Tropsch unit with an ideal <b>hydrocracking</b> unit can produce diesel yields of up to 80 wt. A non-ideal <b>hydrocracking</b> catalyst would lower the middle distillate yields due to the occurrence of secondary cracking. Primary cracking of the paraffins produced by the low temperature FT process occurs only when the activity of the metal is high and the rate limiting step occurs on the acid site. Integrating the wax synthesis process with the subsequent work up of the wax to produce distillate fuels is not without challenges, mainly the low reaction temperature and pressure (225 °C and 20 bar), in which the <b>hydrocracking</b> catalyst is to operate. Noble metals, combined with zeolites are known to be active for <b>hydrocracking</b> at such conditions. Carbon monoxide, a feedstock of the FT process poisons noble metal catalysts; therefore knowledge of its effect on the <b>hydrocracking</b> catalysts performance is essential. The <b>hydrocracking</b> catalysts were tested when the metal and the acid sites were segregated (i. e. the metal supported on an inert carrier, physically mixed with the zeolite), and when the two sites are in close proximity (i. e. the metal impregnated into the zeolite).

In this study, a fuel formulation for a Diesel engine is optimized to achieve 17 lower pollutants emissions and higher engine efficiency. The fuel matrix is based on seven refinery 18 streams representative of gasoline (Hydrotreated Straight-Run Gasoline HSRG, Hydrotreated Fluid 19 Catalytic Cracking HFCC and Reformate REF), kerosene (Hydrotreated Straight-Run Kerosene HSRK 20 and <b>Hydrocracked</b> Kerosene HCKK) and diesel cuts (Hydrotreated Straight-Run Diesel HSRD and 21 <b>Hydrocracked</b> Light Diesel HCKLD).

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was an {{understanding}} of the behavior of ring-opening catalysts concerning their activity and product selectivities in the hydroconversion of decalin when n-decane as a representative for aliphatic hydrocarbons is present. It was investigated how iridium and platinum on non-acidic silica behave as catalysts in the ring opening of decalin alone and in the hydroconversion of an equimolar mixture of decalin with n-decane. It was found that decalin is much less reactive than n-decane when the hydrocarbons are converted alone on 2. 6 Ir/silica or 2. 7 Pt/silica. In the competitive hydroconversion of the equimolar mixture, the reactivity of both feed hydrocarbons was reduced, especially the one of n-decane. It was concluded that the two-ring naphthene decalin is preferentially adsorbed and converted on the catalytically active sites. Primary products in the conversion of an equimolar decalin/n-decane mixture on 2. 6 Ir/silica were <b>hydrocracked</b> products with less than 10 carbon atoms and direct ring-opening products of decalin (dROPs). From a comparison with the results of the pure feed experiments it was possible to attribute the formation of <b>hydrocracked</b> products to the conversion of n-decane. Moreover, it was shown that the product selectivities of skeletal isomers (sk-Isos), ring-opening products (ROPs), open-chain decanes (OCDs) and <b>hydrocracked</b> products (C 9 -) in the mixed feed experiments can be calculated directly out of the product selectivities obtained in the conversion of the pure hydrocarbons. This was also found for the distribution of the dROPs and the composition of the <b>hydrocracked</b> products. Hence, it can be stated that the product selectivities of decalin and n-decane are not influenced by the presence of the respective other hydrocarbon on this non-acidic iridium catalyst. Platinum supported on non-acidic silica was found to be much less active than iridium as catalyst in the hydroconversion of decalin. Primary products of the conversion of the equimolar decalin and n-decane mixture were skeletal isomers of decalin, especially spiro[4. 5]decane, and <b>hydrocracked</b> products. These findings indicate an isomerization ability of platinum, which was also reflected in the high degree of branching of the <b>hydrocracked</b> products. It was found that much higher selectivities of OCDs were obtained in the mixed feed experiment than one would expect from the results of each pure feed hydrocarbon. This is best explained by an isomerization of n-decane on platinum and displacement of the iso-decanes by decalin before they can be <b>hydrocracked,</b> leading to high amounts of branched decanes in the product mixture. Additionally, a detailed look at the composition of the direct ring-opening products indicated a preferred hydrogenolysis of substituted carbon-carbon bonds in decalin which was not influenced by the presence of n decane. Catalysts containing 3 wt. % iridium or platinum supported on zeolite Y with different concentrations of Brønsted acid sites were prepared. An increased catalyst activity in the hydroconversion of equimolar decalin/n-decane mixtures was found with increasing concentration of Brønsted acid sites for iridium and platinum catalysts. When decalin and n-decane were converted solely on the iridium catalysts, n-decane was significantly more reactive than decalin. But, with increasing Brønsted acid site concentration of the catalyst, the reactivity difference gets smaller. It is striking, that the reactivity of decalin and n-decane was inverted when both hydrocarbons were converted competitively. An explanation for this finding was obtained by breakthrough measurements. Decalin was found to be preferentially adsorbed on the Ir/Na,H-Y catalysts. Hence, decalin gets preferred access to the catalytically active sites and is consequently hydroconverted preferentially. On the platinum counterparts to the Ir/Na,H-Y catalysts, a very high isomerization activity was found in the hydroconversion of decalin. In addition, the presence of n-decane did not cause a change in the product selectivities, but as on the Ir/Na,H-Y catalysts, the formation of OCDs was favored and the formation of C 9 - products was slightly suppressed in the competitive hydroconversion of decalin/n-decane. Besides zeolite Y, also zeolites Beta, EMC- 2, L, MOR and ZSM- 5 with different pore systems were loaded with ca. 3 wt. % iridium. On all these catalysts pure n-decane was found to be more reactive than pure decalin. However, the reactivity was inverted when an equimolar mixture of decalin and n-decane was used as feed on the Beta and EMC- 2 catalysts. Those were the catalysts with the highest selectivities of OCDs, among them was 3. 3 Ir/H 0. 58,Cs 0. 42 -Beta- 14, the catalyst on which the highest yields of OCDs were obtained within this work. Decalin was converted preferably on these HIPEROCs in the competitive hydroconversion of decalin and n-decane. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} <b>hydrocracked</b> products from the n-decane hydroconversion on the HIPEROC 3. 3 Ir/H 0. 58,Cs 0. 42 -Beta- 14 consist exclusively of n-alkanes indicating a purely hydrogenolytic carbon-carbon bond scission. At the same time, iso-decanes were formed which possess a distribution of methylnonanes and ethyloctanes which was reported for the isomerization of n-decane on bifunctional isomerization catalysts. It was concluded that both mechanisms proceed simultaneously in the hydroconversion of n-decane on HIPEROCs. This finding supports and gives independent evidence for a mechanism advanced recently for the hydroconversion of decalin on HIPEROCs. Molybdenum carbide was tested as a possible cheaper substitute for noble metals in the ring opening catalysts. Bulk molybdenum carbide turned out to be hardly active in the ring opening of decalin. The primary products were skeletal isomers of decalin, especially spiro[4. 5]decane. With bulk molybdenum carbide as catalyst, open-chain decanes were formed with low selectivities only, whereas <b>hydrocracked</b> products, especially methane, were predominantly made. Catalysts consisting of &# 946;-Mo 2 C supported on zeolite Y were also prepared. &# 946;-Mo 2 C supported on non-acidic zeolite Y turned out to have a very poor activity in the hydroconversion of decalin. The product selectivities were similar as those observed on bulk molybdenum carbide. Upon increasing the concentration of Brønsted acid sites in the zeolite, both the catalytic activity and the selectivities of ROPs and OCDs increased. However, these catalysts showed a considerable contribution of the paring reaction leading to the undesired products iso-butane and methylcyclopentane, as indicated by M-shaped carbon number distribution curves of the <b>hydrocracked</b> products. In an attempt to optimize the &# 946;-Mo 2 C/zeolite Y catalysts, the nSi/nAl ratio of the zeolite was varied between 2. 4 and 105 and the molybdenum loading between 5 and 20 wt. %. The best selectivities of OCDs were achieved with the catalyst 9. 8 Mo 2 C/H 0. 99,Na 0. 01 -Y- 7. More generally speaking, intermediate molybdenum loadings around 10 wt. % and an nSi/nAl ratio of zeolite Y around 7 appear to be favorable for these alternative ring-opening catalysts. In der vorliegenden Arbeit untersucht, wie sich Produktselektivitäten verhalten, wenn an Katalysatoren für die selektive Ringöffnung von Decalin äquimolare Mischungen von Decalin und n-Decan umgesetzt werden. Diese Mischungen dienen als Modell sowohl für naphthenische als auch aliphatische Komponenten in einem realen Einsatzöl, aber auch für gebildete offenkettige Decane und deren Edukt. Deshalb wurde in einem ersten Schritt eine äquimolare Mischung von Decalin und n-Decan an Iridium bzw. Platin geträgert auf nichtsaurem Silica umgesetzt, um die katalytischen Eigenschaften der Edelmetalle allein zu untersuchen. n-Decan stellte sich im Vergleich mit Decalin als deutlich reaktiver heraus, wenn es als Reinkomponente umgesetzt wurde. Im Gegensatz dazu waren die Reaktivitäten der beiden Kohlenwasserstoffe, insbesondere die von n-Decan, bei der konkurrierenden Umsetzung vermindert, so dass dort beide Einsatzkohlenwasserstoffe einen nahezu identischen Umsatzverlauf mit der Temperatur zeigten. Primäre Produkte bei der konkurrierenden Umsetzung von Decalin und n-Decan an 2. 6 Ir/Silica waren direkte Ringöffnungsprodukte (dROPs) und Crackprodukte (C 9 -). Durch den Vergleich der so erhaltenen Produkt¬selektivitäten mit den Selektivitäten aus der Umsetzung der reinen Kohlenwasserstoffe konnte die Bildung der Crackprodukte auf die Umsetzung von n-Decan zurückgeführt werden. Weiterhin ließen sich die Produktselektivitäten der Decalin-Gerüstisomere (sk-Isos), der Ringöffnungs¬produkte (ROPs), der offenkettigen Decane (OCDs) und der Crackprodukte in der Gemischumsetzung direkt aus den erzielten Produktselektivitäten bei der Umsetzung der Reinkomponenten berechnen. Dadurch ließ sich zeigen, dass die Produktselektivitäten an 2. 6 Ir/Silica durch die Anwesenheit des jeweils anderen Kohlenwasserstoffs nicht beeinflusst werden. Im Gegensatz zu Iridium erwies sich Platin als deutlich inaktiver in der Umsetzung von Decalin, was sich in stark erhöhten Reaktionstemperaturen zeigte, die für dessen Umsetzung notwendig waren. Die primären Produkte der Umsetzung einer äquimolaren Decalin/n-Decan-Mischung waren sk-Isos, wobei Spiro[4. 5]decan hervorstach, und Crackprodukte. Die Zusammen¬setzung der direkten Ringöffnungsprodukte von Decalin zeigte keine Veränderung bei gleichzeitiger Umsetzung von n-Decan. Es wurde jeweils bevorzugt die substituierte C-C Bindung von Decalin zu Butylcyclohexan geöffnet. Es wurden in der Folge zeolithische Katalysatoren bestehend aus 3 Massen % Iridium oder Platin geträgert auf Zeolith Y mit unterschiedlichen Konzentrationen an Brønsted Säurezentren hergestellt und in der hydrierenden Umsetzung von Decalin und n-Decan getestet. Dabei zeigte sich eine erhöhte Katalysatoraktivität mit zunehmender Konzentration an Brønsted-Säure¬zentren. Wie schon an den nichtsauren Katalysatoren war auch hier n-Decan deutlich reaktiver als Decalin im direkten Vergleich bei der Umsetzung der jeweiligen reinen Kohlenwasserstoffe. Allerdings wird der Reaktivitätsunterschied zwischen n-Decan und Decalin mit zunehmender Konzentration an Brønsted Säurezentren des Katalysators geringer. Wenn eine äquimolare Mischung aus Decalin und n-Decan umgesetzt wurde, zeigte sich eine invertierte Reaktivität der beiden Einsatzkohlenwasserstoffe – in diesen Fällen reagierte Decalin bevorzugt. Eine Erklärung für dieses Verhalten konnte mit Durchbruchsmessungen von Decalin/n-Decan-Gemischen an einer Reihe von Ir/Na,H-Y-Zeolithen als Adsorbenzien gefunden werden. Decalin wurde jeweils deutlich bevorzugt adsorbiert. Dadurch bildet sich eine höhere Konzentration an Decalin an den katalytisch aktiven Zentren heraus, was in der Folge zu einer bevorzugten Umsetzung von Decalin führt. Die Pt/Na,H-Y-Katalysatoren zeichneten sich allesamt durch eine sehr hohe Isomerisierungsaktivität aus. Die gemeinsame Umsetzung von Decalin und n-Decan führte zu keinen Änderungen der Selektivitäten der dROPs von Decalin, genau wie an den Ir/Na,H-Y-Katalysatoren. Es wurden ebenso in der Umsetzung der äquimolaren Decalin/n-Decan-Mischung höhere Selektivitäten an OCDs und niedrigere Selektivitäten zu Spaltprodukten gefunden als durch Berechnung der erhaltenen Selektivitäten bei der Umsetzung der reinen Einsatzkohlenwasserstoffe zu erwarten war. Als weitere Träger wurden neben Zeolith Y auch die Zeolithe Beta, EMC- 2, L, Mordenit und ZSM- 5 untersucht. Diese Zeolithe unterscheiden sich in ihrer Dimensionalität und den Abmessungen des Porensystems. Alle Zeolithe wurden mit ca. 3 Massen % an Iridium beladen. Die Aktivitäten der Beta- und EMC- 2 -Katalysatoren waren vergleichbar mit der von 3. 3 Ir/Na 0. 72,H 0. 28 -Y- 2. 4, was sich insbesondere auch auf die Reaktivität der einzelnen Kohlenwasserstoffe und deren invertierte Reaktivitäten in der Gemischumsetzung bezog. Eine detaillierte Untersuchung der Zusammensetzung der Produkte der n Decanumsetzung am HIPEROC 3. 3 Ir/H 0. 58,Cs 0. 42 -Beta- 14 ergab, dass (i) sämtliche Spaltprodukte ausschließlich aus n-Alkanen bestehen und (ii) die gleichzeitig gebildeten iso-Decane den sehr charakteristischen Gehalt an Methylnonanen und Ethyloctanen aufweisen, wie er in der Isomerisierung von n-Alkanen an bifunktionellen Katalysatoren gefunden wird. Diese Befunden wurden als starke Hinweise darauf gewertet, dass die hydrogenolytische C-C Bindungsspaltung am Iridium und die Isomerisierung an Brønsted-Säurezentren unabhängig voneinander ablaufen. Diese Tatsache stellt unabhängige Evidenz für den früher postulierten Mechanismus für die Umsetzung von Decalin an HIPEROCs dar. Molybdäncarbid wurde als mögliche preiswerte Alternative zu Edelmetallen in Ringöffnungskatalysatoren getestet. Der Vollkatalysator besaß jedoch nur eine geringe spezifische Oberfläche von 30 m 2 •g- 1 und war äußerst inaktiv in der Ringöffnung von Decalin. Erhaltene Primärprodukte waren Gerüstisomere, insbesondere Spiro[4. 5]decan. Offenkettige Decane wurden nur mit niedriger Selektivität aus Decalin gebildet. Hauptprodukte waren kurzkettige Spaltprodukte, insbesondere Methan. Mit dem Ziel höhere Aktivitäten zu erzielen, wurden Katalysatoren mit auf Zeolith Y geträgertem Molybdäncarbid präpariert. Auf nichtsaurem Zeolith Y erwies sich &# 946; Mo 2 C als sehr inaktiv und glich in seinen katalytischen Eigenschaften dem &# 946;-Mo 2 C-Vollkatalysator. Mit Erhöhung der Brønsted-Säurezentren¬konzentration des Trägers erhöhten sich sowohl die Katalysator¬aktivität als auch die Produktselektivitäten zu ROPs und OCDs. Gleichzeitig stiegen aber auch die Selektivitäten von unerwünschtem Isobutan und Methylcyclopentan durch die „Paring Reaktion“. Zur Optimierung der geträgerten Molybdäncarbidkatalysatoren wurden das nSi/nAl-Verhältnis zwischen 2. 4 und 105 und die Molybdänbeladung zwischen 5 und 20 Massen % variiert. Die höchsten Selektivitäten zu OCDs wurden an Katalysator 9. 8 Mo 2 C/H 0. 99,Na 0. 01 -Y- 7 erzielt. Im Allgemeinen zeigten sich Molybdänbeladungen von ca. 10 Massen % und ein nSi/nAl-Verhältnis von 7 bei Zeolith Y als vorteilhaft für die Ringöffnung von Decalin an diesen alternativen Katalysatoren...|$|E

The distribution of the isomerization products obtained from the n-paraffin mixture and the hydrotreated gasoil on Pt/ZSM- 22 shows that pore-mouth and key-lock catalysis are operative, although the selective formation of branching {{at the end of the}} carbon chain is less pronounced. Ethylbranching is suppressed in liquid as well as vapor phase conditions. The cracked products obtained on Pt/ZSM- 22 for both feedstocks contain a high amount of linear paraffins in comparison to the amount observed for hydrocracking on Pt/USY. This indicates that similar to vapor phase operations, the scission of the bond in the beta position of the positively charged secondary carbon atom towards a new secondary carbenium ion (s,s beta-scission) is also the dominant cracking mechanism for operations in liquid phase. The differences between vapor and liquid phase operations of Pt/ZSM- 22 are attributed to differences in the adsorption modes of the molecules. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.

High reaction temperature employed in the accelerated catalyst aging resulted in large amounts of carbonaceous deposition with high aromaticity, which {{was found to be}} the principal deactivation cause. The effect of catalyst deactivation on hydrocracking of vacuum residue was studied. Experiments were carried out in a batch reactor at 60 bar, feed to catalyst ratio 10 : 1 and temperature 425 °C.

In each cycle-run, a fresh feedstock was used with the same sulfide catalyst. The quality of distillate products, such as hydrodesulfurization (HDS) was decreased from 61. 50 % to 39. 52 %, while asphaltene contents of the total liquid product were increased from 2. 7 % to 5. 2 % and their boiling ranges were increased during these duration times due to the successive catalyst deactivation during the 5 cycle-runs, caused by successive adsorption of coke formation...|$|E
40|$|Time-consuming {{external}} standard-based calibration {{methods are}} usually performed for hydrocarbon group type analysis (HGTA) of fossil fuels, {{regardless of the}} instrumental chromatographic technique. In this work, HGTA of a broad variety of coal and petroleum products is performed using a modern thin-layer chromatography-flame ionization detection (TLC-FID) system and a rapid method based on internal normalization. Repeatability, linear intervals, and sample load ranges for quantitative application of this method are detailed for different products that cover {{a broad range of}} boiling points and chemical functionalities in the field of fossil fuels: a heavy oil and its derived <b>hydrocracked</b> products, raw and chemically-modified petroleum asphaltenes, a coal-tar pitch, several coal extracts, and coal hydroliquefaction products. Results from external standard calibration and a normalization method (both obtained by TLC-FID) are in agreement, and they are validated using TLC-ultraviolet scanning. The use of the latter demonstrates that TLC-FID can also be applied to products such as coal extracts and hydroliquefaction products, despite these products being more volatile than petroleum asphaltenes or heavy oils. For preparative purposes when external calibration is necessary, preparative TLC and SPE are less time-consuming alternatives to MPLC fractionation, providing similar results...|$|E
40|$|A 4 -lump {{kinetic model}} {{including}} hydrogen consumption for <b>hydrocracking</b> of {{vacuum gas oil}} in a pilot scale reactor is proposed. The advantage of this work over the previous ones is consideration of hydrogen consumption, imposed by converting vacuum gas oil to light products, which is implemented in the kinetic model by a quadratic expression as similar as response surface modeling. This approach considers vacuum gas oil (VGO) and unconverted oil as one lump whilst others are distillate, naphtha and gas. The pilot reactor bed is divided into hydrotreating and <b>hydrocracking</b> sections which are loaded with different types of catalysts. The aim {{of this paper is}} modeling the <b>hydrocracking</b> section, but the effect of hydrotreating is considered on the boundary condition of the <b>hydrocracking</b> part. The <b>hydrocracking</b> bed is considered as a plug flow reactor and it is modeled by the cellular network approach. Initially, a kinetic network with twelve coefficients and six paths is considered. But following evaluation using measured data and order of magnitude analysis, the three route passes and one activation energy coefficient are omitted; thus the number of coefficients is reduced to five. This approach improves the average absolute deviation of prediction from 7. 2 % to 5. 92 %. Furthermore, the model can predict the hydrogen consumption for <b>hydrocracking</b> with average absolute deviation about 8. 59 % in comparison to those calculated from experimental data...|$|R

EDTA is a selective agent for the extraction of EFAl from USY preserving the framework Al content. Concomitant with EFAl removal, EDTA enhances the textural properties and changes bulk and surface properties, in particular the Al speciation. <b>Hydrocracking</b> catalysts were prepared from the modified USY zeolites and alumina loaded with a P-promoted NiMo-sulfide phase. Their performance was evaluated in the <b>hydrocracking</b> of a heavy vacuum gas oil under conditions close to the industrial practice. The most active <b>hydrocracking</b> catalyst is obtained by removal of a relatively small amount of EFAl from the USY zeolite. The mild EDTA treatment to achieve this selectively extracts amorphous EFAl species from the mesopore system, resulting in better access to acid sites and an increase of the concentration of strong Brønsted acid sites. Severe EDTA treatment resulted in lower <b>hydrocracking</b> activity which was ascribed to progressive leaching of EFAl synergistically involved in the cracking catalysis. The present study therefore points out the importance of the presence of some EFAl species for the <b>hydrocracking</b> of real feedstocks.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. With the {{continued}} decline in global oil reserves, {{there is a}} growing need to develop alternative sources of conventional fuels to complement the current dependence on crude oil feedstocks. Natural gas, coal and biomass have been identified for this purpose. The distinctive advantage of using natural (stranded) gas is that it is turned into a useful product, thereby increasing its value and reducing the environmental impact of simply flaring it. The value-added work up of natural gas is effected by Gas-to-Liquid conversion via the Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis. Long-chain hydrocarbon waxes are produced and these are subsequently <b>hydrocracked</b> into the required middle distillate fuels, preferably diesel, as diesel engines are more efficient than their petrol counterparts. Hydrocracking may be carried out using a bifunctional catalyst, consisting of metal and acid components. Industrially, hydrocracking is used to crack heavy crude oil fractions into the desired fuel range, however, the catalysts used are sulphided transition metals. These are less suitable for cracking Fischer-Tropsch waxes as they would introduce sulphur into a clean feedstock. Moreover, at reaction temperatures of around 250 Â°C, transition metal sulphide catalysts display little activity. Thus, one may consider noble metals such as palladium or platinum, whilst shape selective zeolites may be used as the acid component...|$|E

In this paper, a series of experiments have been performed under electrical discharge according to ASTM D 6180. Various insulating fluids were considered. The samples include minerals oils, synthetic and natural esters, and silicone fluid. The results indicate that the gassing tendency of natural esters is much lower than their counterparts. No significant differences between synthetic esters and silicone fluid were observed. Severely hydrotreated and <b>hydrocracked</b> oils indicate a higher gassing tendency. It is also shown that service-aged oil gassing tendency decreases with reclamation passes. The reclamation of service aged oil by three commercially available Fuller's Earth (FE) showed a declined gassing tendency when FE helped reducing the DDF and turbidity. In addition, the theoretical premises that, oil born decay products contribute to the oil gassing, is experimentally confirmed under laboratory conditions. Extended stability test (3 times longer than the standard specification) also provide convincing evidences that each brand of mineral insulating oil might contain a limited amount of unstable hydrocarbons and volatile compounds.
