6000|$|Dear fellow-artist, why so free [...] With {{every sort}} of company, [...] With every Jack and Jill? [...] Choose your companions from the best; [...] Who <b>draws</b> a <b>bucket</b> {{with the rest}} [...] Soon topples down the hill.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Wouldn't hev your {{conscience}} fer a thousand quintal," [...] said Dan. [...] "Turn in, Penn. You've no call to do boy's work. <b>Draw</b> a <b>bucket,</b> Harvey. Oh, Penn, dump {{these in the}} gurry-butt 'fore you sleep. Kin you keep awake that long?" ...|$|R
6000|$|My curiosity being now fully aroused, I {{whispered to}} one of the familiars, {{as he was about to}} leave the room, and begged an {{interpretation}} of the strange scene before me. A few words were sufficient for the purpose. I found that these mysterious personages, whom I had mistaken for magi, were principally authors, and were in the very act of manufacturing books. I was, in fact, in the reading-room of the great British Library, an immense collection of volumes of all ages and languages, many of which are now forgotten, and most of which are seldom read: one of these sequestered pools of obsolete literature to which modern authors repair, and <b>draw</b> <b>buckets</b> full of classic lore, or [...] "pure English, undefiled," [...] wherewith to swell their own scanty rills of thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless your heart! Of course I {{can spare}} you some food," [...] the woman answered, and {{entering}} her cottage she soon {{returned with a}} tray loaded with sandwiches, cakes and cheese. One of the children <b>drew</b> a <b>bucket</b> of clear, cold water from a spring and the three wanderers ate heartily and enjoyed the good things immensely.|$|R
60|$|As {{he takes}} his seat with some {{difficulty}} and {{with an air of}} pain, Mr. <b>Bucket</b> <b>draws</b> a little nearer, standing with one of his large hands on the library-table.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a {{well just}} outside," [...] Stanislas said. [...] "I saw them <b>drawing</b> water in <b>buckets</b> as we came in. I suppose it was the well of this castle, in the old time." ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} error convergence in classifier systems {{learning in}} the dynamic environment when playing the tic-tac-toe game. The double learning of classifier systems is considered. A classifier system can play against another classifier system, an expert system, random generator or a human being. Various strategies can be developed {{in the course of}} learning due to the two-stage reward system (a win or a <b>draw).</b> The <b>Bucket</b> Brigade algorithm is employed for classifier rule chain learning...|$|R
60|$|The boy's {{first act}} was {{to walk over}} to where the palace had stood and search the ruins until he found some scraps of food that had been {{overlooked}} by the enemy. He sat upon a block of marble and ate of this, and tears filled {{his eyes as he}} gazed upon the desolation around him. But Inga tried to bear up bravely, and having satisfied his hunger {{he walked over to the}} well, intending to <b>draw</b> a <b>bucket</b> of drinking water.|$|R
60|$|And {{it would}} seem not {{unreasonable}} to suppose, that it is by {{this means that the}} fluid itself becomes charged with the luminous principle. <b>Draw</b> a <b>bucket</b> of water from the phosphorescent ocean, and it still retains traces of fire; but, standing awhile, this soon subsides. Now pour it along the deck, and it is a stream of flame; caused by its renewed agitation. Empty the bucket, and for a space sparkles cling to it tenaciously; and every stave seems ignited.|$|R
60|$|Having {{remained}} upon {{deck with}} the doctor some time after the rest had gone below, I was just {{on the point of}} following him down, when I saw the Mowree rise, <b>draw</b> a <b>bucket</b> of water, and holding it high above his head, pour its contents right over him. This he repeated several times. There was nothing very peculiar in the act, but something else about him struck me. However, I thought no more of it, but descended the scuttle.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a bucket, now," [...] said Marco to himself. [...] "I declare, I believe I'll draw up some water. Forester {{said that}} it was hard, but I think it will be easy. I'll <b>draw</b> up a <b>bucket</b> full, and carry to him and show him." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{dragline}} bucket system {{consists of a}} large bucket which is suspended from a boom (a large truss-like structure) with wire ropes. The bucket is maneuvered {{by means of a}} number of ropes and chains. The hoist rope, powered by large diesel or electric motors, supports the bucket and hoist-coupler assembly from the boom. The dragrope is used to <b>draw</b> the <b>bucket</b> assembly horizontally. By skillful maneuver of the hoist and the dragropes the bucket is controlled for various operations. A schematic of a large {{dragline bucket}} system is shown below.|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{bachelor}} {{work is to}} describe the design process bucket elevator. Work is processed as study material for students of bachelor study. The first part is a basic description of the bucket elevator and its types. Furthermore, {{the description of the}} basic parts of the bucket elevator. The second part contains equations for bucket elevator design (design <b>drawing</b> element, <b>buckets,</b> engine). Are given two ways to resolve according to [1, 2] and the conclusion of this work is presented a comparative calculation of these solutions...|$|R
5000|$|Says he, “I’ll {{give you}} a sign. You’ve got a respectable wife, and so many children. At this minute your wife has just <b>drawn</b> a <b>bucket</b> of water at the well to wash her dishes. Look at your watch and {{find out if it}} ain’t so when you get home. As to your mare, she’s not a dozen miles from home. She strayed into such neighborhood, and as they didn’t know whose she was they put her up till she should be claimed. My fee’s a dollar. Be off!” ...|$|R
30|$|A {{total of}} 100 samples from boreholes, open wells and springs (67 from the Banana Plain; 33 from springs only, in the Mount Cameroon area) were {{collected}} in April 2009 and January 2010. Available water resources in the study areas were randomly sampled with emphasis laid on uniform spatial distribution. Locations and altitudes of selected sample sites were determined on the field using a Garmin GPS. All the samples, collected in tightly capped high-quality polyethylene bottles, were immediately transported under low temperature conditions in ice box and stored at 4  °C until analysis. Water {{from most of the}} springs sampled was pumped to the surface using a peristaltic pump equipped with a tubing. The end of the tubing was placed as near as possible to the spring vent. Some spring samples were collected without the use of the pump when sampling containers could easily be placed directly in the spring outflow. Water was collected from open wells using <b>drawing</b> <b>buckets</b> tied with ropes, while boreholes were pumped for 5 – 15  min before sampling. These waters were poured into 500 -ml-capacity plastic bottles after rinsing with the sample and preserved airtight to avoid evaporation. Physico-chemical parameters like pH, electrical conductivity (EC), water temperature, oxygen reduction potential (ORP) and dissolved oxygen (DO) of sampled springs were measured in situ using pH/EC/temperature TOA-DKK meter, TOA-DKK ORP meter and a TOA-DKK DO meter, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{variant of}} this uses {{a small house}} roughly 48 inches by 48 inches and roughly 6 feet tall, the water must be <b>drawn</b> by <b>buckets</b> from a small pool. These buckets are then passed from member to member roughly 10 feet to a [...] "thrower" [...] the thrower then throws the water on the pitched roof of the building. The water runs off the roof into a rain gutter which drains into a barrel which is about 25-30 gallons in capacity, this water then runs into a small tube which fills a 1-gallon jug. The timer ends when the jug is filled.|$|R
60|$|After <b>drawing</b> a <b>bucket</b> of water, {{and having}} a good washing, to get off some of the chicken-coop stains, I went down into the {{forecastle}} to dress myself as neatly as I could. I put on a white shirt in place of my red one, and got into a pair of cloth trowsers instead of my duck ones, and put on my new pumps, and then carefully brushing my shooting-jacket, I put that on over all, so that upon the whole, I made quite a genteel figure, at least for a forecastle, though I would not have looked so well in a drawing-room.|$|R
50|$|Hui'an maidens {{have very}} {{distinct}} customs regarding their marriage. Newlyweds {{are not allowed}} to stay together on their wedding night, so the groom stays in a friend's house. On the second day, the bride pays respects to the groom's family and gives gifts to the elders. On the third day, the groom's sister leads the bride to the communal well to <b>draw</b> two <b>buckets</b> of water. After five days of obeying various customs, she returns to her parents' home. The bride and groom are forbidden to live together or even talk to each other until the bride bears a child. Younger generations no longer practice these customs.|$|R
60|$|All {{the spirit}} and indignation had been knocked out of them--they were too miserable and dejected to utter a complaint. The {{sergeant}} ordered his men to <b>draw</b> up some <b>buckets</b> of water, and told the recruits to wash themselves and make themselves as decent as they could, and the order was sharply enforced by the captain when he came on deck.|$|R
50|$|In 1793 he was {{secretary}} of the Fame Fire Association, and announced that the society had procured a fire-escape apparatus to save persons from burning houses {{by means of a}} <b>bucket</b> <b>drawn</b> {{up to the top of}} the building. During the administration of John Adams, he became public printer, and established an extensive printing office and book bindery in Washington, D.C., at great expense, for the purpose of publishing public documents.|$|R
60|$|With {{these words}} the Witch fell {{down in a}} brown, melted, shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor. Seeing that she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy <b>drew</b> another <b>bucket</b> of water and threw it over the mess. She then swept it all out the door. After picking out the silver shoe, which {{was all that was}} left of the old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on her foot again. Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran out to the {{courtyard}} to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had come to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land.|$|R
25|$|Drag-line {{excavation}} {{systems are}} heavy equipment used in civil engineering and surface mining. In civil engineering the smaller types {{are used for}} road and port construction. The larger types are used in strip-mining operations to move overburden above coal, and for tar-sand mining. A drag line bucket system consists of a large bucket which is suspended from a boom, a large truss-like structure, with wire ropes. The bucket is maneuvered {{by means of a}} number of ropes and chains. The hoist rope, powered by large diesel or electric motors, supports the bucket and hoist-coupler assembly from the boom. The drag rope is used to <b>draw</b> the <b>bucket</b> assembly horizontally. By skillful maneuvre of the hoist and the drag ropes the bucket is controlled for various operations. The dragline excavator was invented in 1904 by John W. Page.|$|R
50|$|To better {{understand}} the situation surrounding the partition of India, Singh provides information about both religions involved.The book sheds light on the various religious practices of both Sikhs and Muslims in rural India. Singh describes daily life for individuals from both practices. For example, Singh describes the practice of prayer for Muslims.“The mullah at the mosque knows {{that it is time}} for the morning prayer. He has a quick wash, stands facing west towards Mecca and with his fingers in his ears cries in long sonorous notes,Allah-o-Akbar (4)”Singh points out practices of Sikhs as well,“The priest at the Sikh temple lies in bed till the mullah has called. Then he too gets up, <b>draws</b> a <b>bucket</b> of water from the well in the temple courtyard, pours it over himself, and intones his prayer in monotonous singsong to the sound of splashing water (5)"".|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{significant}} attention they have <b>drawn,</b> big <b>bucket</b> lot-sizing problems remain notoriously difficult to solve. Previous work of Akartunali and Miller (2012) presented results (computational and theoretical) indicating that what makes these problems difficult are the embedded single-machine, single-level, multi-period submodels. We therefore consider the simplest such submodel, a multi-item, two-period capacitated relaxation. We propose a methodology that can approximate the convex hulls of all such possible relaxations by generating violated valid inequalities. To generate such inequalities, we separate two-period projections of fractional LP solutions from the convex hulls of the two-period closure we study. The convex hull {{representation of the}} two-period closure is generated dynamically using column generation. Contrary to regular column generation, our method is an outer approximation, and therefore can be used efficiently in a regular branch-and-bound procedure. We present computational results that illustrate how these two-period models could be effective in solving complicated problems...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Bucket softly {{opens the}} door of {{communication}} between that room and the next and looks in. The library is deserted, and the fire is sinking low. Mr. Bucket's eye, after taking a pigeon-flight round the room, alights upon a table where letters are usually put as they arrive. Several letters for Sir Leicester are upon it. Mr. <b>Bucket</b> <b>draws</b> near and examines the directions. [...] "No," [...] he says, [...] "there's none in that hand. It's only me as is written to. I can break it to Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, to-morrow." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{distinction}} is <b>drawn</b> between Crystals <b>bucket</b> theory of language processing and an overflow of effects between different linguistic levels in language production. Most {{of the examples}} are drawn from Welsh (a language of mutual interest to the author and the honoree of this issue). For that reason, it is proposed that this effect is termed the rhaeadr effect (from the Welsh for waterfall). The rhaeadr effect is illustrated with the initial consonant mutation systems of Welsh and Irish, and with data from both normal phonological (and morphophonological) development and disordered speech...|$|R
6000|$|... "De Mieville," [...] he said, as {{the officer}} rode up towards the tower, [...] "do not shed more blood. Thirty {{at least have}} fallen in their attack on this turret, besides {{those who have been}} killed by your fire. Take the rest, disarm them all, let the men cut some stout {{switches}} and give every man twenty blows well laid on the back, and then let them go. Before you do so, send a dozen of them to clear the staircase and to <b>draw</b> some <b>buckets</b> of water from the well and sluice the steps down. Paolo, do you run down and find a vessel of some sort and a goblet or horn, and bring up some wine from one of those barrels. The ladies sorely need something after what they have gone through, and I myself shall be all the better for it, for the loss of blood has given me a raging thirst." ...|$|R
60|$|Then were {{fulfilled}} many sayings, and {{the weakest}} of these condemned brought relief and healing to the others. Amalu the drudge awoke (like the rest) to sickness {{of body and}} distress of mind; but the habit of obedience ruled in that simple spirit, and, appalled to be so late, he went direct into the galley, kindled the fire, and began to get breakfast. At the rattle of dishes, the snapping of the fire, and the thin smoke that went up straight into the air, the spell was lifted. The condemned felt once more the good dry land of habit under foot; they touched again the familiar guide-ropes of sanity; they were restored {{to a sense of}} the blessed revolution and return of all things earthly. The captain <b>drew</b> a <b>bucket</b> of water and began to bathe. Tommy sat up, watched him a while, and slowly followed his example; and Carthew, remembering his last thoughts of the night before, hastened to the cabin.|$|R
50|$|A {{disciple of}} the Mother and Sri Aurobindo {{in this village}} wrote to the Mother about the calamitous {{situation}} and begged for the relief. The Mother soon responded to his prayer and sent her blessing packet. The petals in the blessing packet were mixed with a small quantity of wheat and sown in one acre area of land. The land was irrigated with water <b>drawn</b> in <b>buckets</b> from deep wells. With Mothers grace and to everyone’s surprise the miracle happened. A bumper crop, such as never seen before, {{came up in the}} parched land. The yield was incredible, which was more than the usual yield of 10 Acres of land at that time. And the famine stricken village became the origin of Green Revolution in Rewa Division. Now, with passage of time many who worked as labourer are in possession of tractors, zeeps, cars and their own harvesting machine, implements, tube wells. Pukka buildings have replaced the thatched roof huts.|$|R
60|$|Three {{months later}} {{they came back}} over the divide {{in the midst of}} a snow- storm and dropped down the trail to 24 ELDORADO. It merely chanced that the trail led them that way. They were not looking for the claim. Nor could they see much through the driving white till they set foot upon the claim itself. And then the air lightened, and they beheld a dump, capped by a {{windlass}} that a man was turning. They saw him <b>draw</b> a <b>bucket</b> of gravel from the hole and tilt it on the edge of the dump. Likewise they saw another, man, strangely familiar, filling a pan with the fresh gravel. His hands were large; his hair wets pale yellow. But before they reached him, he turned with the pan and fled toward a cabin. He wore no hat, and the snow falling down his neck accounted for his haste. Bill and Kink ran after him, and came upon him in the cabin, kneeling by the stove and washing the pan of gravel in a tub of water.|$|R

60|$|But {{there were}} some things which must be brought to the house by the dealers, such as water for {{drinking}} and cooking, which is drawn from public cisterns in the squares, and carried by stout young girls to all the houses. These bigolanti all come from the mountains of Friuli; they all have rosy cheeks, white teeth, bright eyes, and no waists whatever (in the fashionable sense), but abundance of back. The cisterns are opened about eight o'clock in the morning, and then their day's work begins with chatter, and splashing, and <b>drawing</b> up <b>buckets</b> from the wells; and each sturdy little maiden in turn trots off under a burden of two buckets,--one appended from either end of a bow resting upon the right shoulder. The water is very good, for it is the rain which falls on the shelving surface of the campo, and soaks through a bed of sea-sand around the cisterns into the cool depths below. The bigolante comes every morning and empties her brazen buckets into the great picturesque jars of porous earthenware which ornament Venetian kitchens; and the daily supply of water costs a moderate family about a florin a month.|$|R
6000|$|The next {{who came}} forward was a blind man. He had worked {{long in the}} mine--so long that he could find {{his way through the}} {{labyrinth}} of levels as easily in his blind state as he did formerly with his eyesight. When his eyes were destroyed (in the usual way, by the explosion of a hole), he was only off work during the period of convalescence. Afterwards he returned to his familiar haunts underground; and although he could no longer labour in the old way, he was quite able to work a windlass, and <b>draw</b> up the <b>bucket</b> at a winze. For this he now pocketed two pounds sterling, and walked off as vigorously as if he had possessed both his eyes! ...|$|R
6000|$|Republican as {{were their}} manners, {{there was no}} practical, at least no dangerous, lack of discipline. Wicks was the only sailor on board, there was none to criticise; and besides, he was so easy-going, and so merry-minded, that none could bear to {{disappoint}} him. Carthew did his best, partly {{for the love of}} doing it, partly for love of the captain; Amalu was a willing drudge, and even Hemstead and Hadden turned to upon occasion with a will. Tommy's department was the trade and traderoom; he would work down in the hold or over the shelves of the cabin, till the Sydney dandy was unrecognisable; come up at last, <b>draw</b> a <b>bucket</b> of sea-water, bathe, change, and lie down on deck over a big sheaf of Sydney Heralds and Dead Birds, or perhaps with a volume of Buckle's [...] "History of Civilisation," [...] the standard work selected for that cruise. In the latter case a smile went round the ship, for Buckle almost invariably laid his student out, and when Tom woke again he was almost always in the humour for brown sherry. The connection was so well established that [...] "a glass of Buckle" [...] or [...] "a bottle of civilisation" [...] became current pleasantries on board the Currency Lass.|$|R
60|$|I {{had three}} hundred cooks to dress my victuals, in little {{convenient}} huts built about my house, where {{they and their}} families lived, and prepared me two dishes a-piece. I took up twenty waiters in my hand, and placed them on the table: a hundred more attended below on the ground, some with dishes of meat, and some with barrels of wine and other liquors slung on their shoulders; all which the waiters above drew up, as I wanted, in a very ingenious manner, by certain cords, as we <b>draw</b> the <b>bucket</b> up a well in Europe. A dish of their meat was a good mouthful, and a barrel of their liquor a reasonable draught. Their mutton yields to ours, but their beef is excellent. I have had a sirloin so large, that I {{have been forced to}} make three bites of it; but this is rare. My servants were astonished to see me eat it, bones and all, as in our country we do the leg of a lark. Their geese and turkeys I usually ate at a mouthful, and I confess they far exceed ours. Of their smaller fowl I could take up twenty or thirty {{at the end of my}} knife.|$|R
