5|$|By {{the end of}} 1906, most {{leaders from}} Azusa Street had spun off to form other congregations, such as the 51st Street Apostolic Faith Mission, the Spanish AFM, and the Italian Pentecostal Mission.

The Southeast United States was a particularly prolific area of <b>growth</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> movement, since Seymour's approach gave a useful explanation for a charismatic spiritual climate {{that had already been}} taking root in those areas.

5|$|Colbourn {{established}} the university's honors program, {{and started the}} university's first satellite branch campus. In addition, Colbourn was responsible for constructing the Central Florida Research Park, located adjacent to the UCF campus and founded in 1978. The park serves as {{a major focus of}} simulation for space and defense-related research. The park was one part of Colbourn's plan to make UCF a world-class partnership university. Among the university's first partners were Lockheed Martin and the United States Navy, and Colbourn led the push to found both the Institute for Simulation and Training and the Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers in 1986. During his tenure, enrollment increased from 11,000 in 1978 to over 18,000 in 1989. However, Colbourn's most notable accomplishments as president were supporting the young university's athletic programs. He was responsible for establishing the school's football program in 1979, which began an era of <b>growth</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> university. In April 1979, UCF awarded its 15,000th degree.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Arlington's largest {{employers}} remained its shingle mills and saw mills.

The Great Depression of the 1930s forced {{all but one of the}} mills to close, causing unemployment to rise in Arlington and neighboring cities. The federal government established a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp near Darrington to create temporary jobs; the young men built structures and conducted firefighting in the Mount Baker National Forest. The Works Progress Administration and Civil Works Administration funded the construction of the city's sidewalks, a high school, and a municipal airport that opened in 1934.|$|E

With a total sponsored research income of $324.624 million in 2015, McMaster has the eighth largest sponsored research income in the country. In the same year, Research Infosource ranked McMaster as the second most research intensive university {{in the country with}} an average research income of C$358,300 per full-time faculty member, the second highest average in the country. Its research activities exceed those of universities twice its size. The federal government is the largest source of funding, providing 54 percent of McMaster's research budget, primarily through grants. Corporate research income account for 35 percent of the overall research budget.|$|E

The targets for the four indicators making up the national bonus were 2–3% for real median income growth of citizens and real median income <b>growth</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lowest 20th percentile of citizens, 3–5% for real GDP growth, and not more than 4.5% for the unemployment rate of citizens.

5|$|Roman {{city life}} and culture changed greatly {{in the early}} Middle Ages. Although Italian cities {{remained}} inhabited, they contracted significantly in size. Rome, for instance, shrank from a population {{of hundreds of thousands}} to around 30,000 {{by the end of the}} 6th century. Roman temples were converted into Christian churches and city walls remained in use. In Northern Europe, cities also shrank, while civic monuments and other public buildings were raided for building materials. The establishment of new kingdoms often meant some <b>growth</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> towns chosen as capitals. Although there had been Jewish communities in many Roman cities, the Jews suffered periods of persecution after the conversion of the empire to Christianity. Officially they were tolerated, if subject to conversion efforts, and at times were even encouraged to settle in new areas.|$|E
5|$|The Institution grew slowly until 1964 when Sidney Dillon Ripley became secretary.

Since {{the completion of the}} Arts and Industries Building, the Smithsonian has expanded to twenty separate museums with roughly 137 million objects in their collections, including works of art, natural specimens, and cultural artifacts. The Smithsonian museums are visited by over 25 million people every year.|$|E

Over {{the course of a}} century, a series of acquisitions, mergers, and re-brandings lead to the transformation of Hammond Engineering into the ruthless commercial empire that is the IMC.

5|$|The {{economy is}} heavily reliant upon {{remittances}} from overseas Filipinos, which surpass {{foreign direct investment}} {{as a source of}} foreign currency. Remittances peaked in 2010 at 10.4% of the national GDP, and were 8.6% in 2012 and in 2014, Philippines total worth of foreign exchange remittances was US$28 billion. Regional development is uneven, with Luzon – Metro Manila in particular – gaining most of the new economic growth {{at the expense of the}} other regions, although the government has taken steps to distribute economic growth by promoting investment in other areas of the country. Despite constraints, service industries such as tourism and business process outsourcing have been identified as areas with some of the best opportunities for <b>growth</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> country.|$|E
5|$|The maximum {{terminal}} hair length {{depends on}} the length of the anagen (period of hair <b>growth)</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> individual. Waist-length hair or longer is only possible to reach for people with long anagen. The anagen lasts between 2 and 7 years, for some individuals even longer, and is followed by shorter catagen (transition) and telogen (resting) periods. At any given time, about 85% of hair strands are in anagen. The fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) gene affects the hair cycle in mammals including humans; blocking FGF5 in the human scalp (by applying a herbal extract that blocked FGF5) extends the hair cycle, resulting in less hair fall and increased hair growth.|$|E

5|$|Support for airport {{expansion}} {{is based on}} an economic case that regards the air transport industry not only as an important industry in its own right, but also as a facilitator of <b>growth</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> economy as a whole. One study predicts that the government's strategy will realise an additional £13billion per annum in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2030. Another study which is critical of the government approach, and which favours addressing environmental impacts through increased taxation of air transport, indicates a negative economic benefit resulting from airport expansion. In 2006 the industry was responsible for over 6 per cent of all UK carbon emissions, a figure that is set to rise as demand increases. Under current strategies of emissions reduction and growth in air transport, air travel in the UK could account for up to 50 per cent of the UK carbon budget by 2050. Industry attempts to address this issue are longer term efforts based on technological and operational improvements, whilst government policy is based on the inclusion of air transport within emissions trading schemes. Critics advocate a shift in government policy to address environmental impacts by constraining the growth in demand for air travel, primarily through the use of economic instruments to price air travel less attractively. Local environmental issues include noise and air quality, and the impact of these, particularly {{in the case of the}} former, is subject to debate. Government policy generally is that these are local issues best addressed locally, and has introduced legislation designed to facilitate this.|$|E
