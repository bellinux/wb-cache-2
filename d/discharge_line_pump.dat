40|$|Nowadays, {{increasing}} {{the efficiency of}} white goods and small house appliances has become necessity {{as a result of}} the technological developments, competition and energy policies. As a basic component of the cooling system, compressor is the most fundamental element for determining the performance and efficiency of the system. In hermetic compressors for household refrigerators, one of the major factors of total compressor efficiency is the <b>discharge</b> <b>line</b> flow efficiency. In this paper, the effects of some of the structural changes to flow losses at <b>discharge</b> <b>line</b> of a hermetic reciprocating compressor were investigated experimentally. For this study, 3 different conceptual designs were created based on the <b>discharge</b> <b>line</b> design parameters such as line diameter, resonator volumes and line length. By performing precise pressure measurements and calorimeter tests, performance and pressure drop rates of conceptual designs were compared against the base model and each other of the conceptual design compressors. The result of the experimental studies helps to identify the effect of the <b>discharge</b> <b>line</b> design parameters to the system performance...|$|R
50|$|When {{examining}} a sump pump and cleaning it, dirt, gravel, sand, and other debris {{should be removed}} to increase efficiency and {{extend the life of}} the pump. These obstructions can also decrease the pump's ability to drain the sump, and can allow the sump to overflow. The check valve can also jam from the debris. Examine the <b>discharge</b> <b>line</b> opening, when applicable, to ensure there are no obstructions in the line. Even a partially obstructed <b>discharge</b> <b>line</b> can force a sump pump to work harder and increase its chance of overheating and failure.|$|R
50|$|There are 14 4-stage 80,000-horsepower {{centrifugal}} pumps that push the {{water up to}} the top of the mountain. Each motor-pump unit stands 65-feet high and weighs 420 tons. The pumps themselves extend downward six floors. Each unit discharges water into a manifold that connects to the main <b>discharge</b> <b>lines.</b> The two main <b>discharge</b> <b>lines</b> stairstep up the mountain in an 8400-foot long tunnel. They are 12.5 feet in diameter for the first half and 14-feet in diameter for the last half. They each contain 8.5 million gallons of water at all times. At full capacity, the pumps can fling nearly 2 million gallons per minute up over the Tehachapis. At the top of mountain, there’s a 68-feet high, 50-foot diameter surge tank. This prevents tunnel damage when the valves to the pumps are suddenly open or closed. Near the top of the lift there are valves which can close the <b>discharge</b> <b>lines</b> to prevent backflow into the pumping plant below in event of a rupture.|$|R

40|$|A mean <b>line</b> <b>pump</b> flow {{modeling}} method {{has been developed}} to provide a fast capability for modeling turbopumps of rocket engines. Based on this method, a mean <b>line</b> <b>pump</b> flow code PUMPA has been written that can predict the performance of pumps at off-design operating conditions, given {{the loss of the}} diffusion system at the design point. The pump code can model axial flow inducers, mixed-flow and centrifugal pumps. The code can model multistage pumps in series. The code features rapid input setup and computer run time, and is an effective analysis and conceptual design tool. The map generation capability of the code provides the map information needed for interfacing with a rocket engine system modeling code. The off-design and multistage modeling capabilities of the code permit parametric design space exploration of candidate pump configurations and provide pump performance data for engine system evaluation. The PUMPA code has been integrated with the Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS) code and an expander rocket engine system has been simulated.

40|$|A digital {{distributed}} parameter {{model was}} used to {{study the effects of}} propellant-feed- system coupling and various hydraulic parameters on the analytical prediction of chugging instabilities. Coupling between the combustion chamber and feed system was controlled by varying the compliance of the injector-dome region. The coupling with the feed system above the pump was varied by changing the amount of cavitation compliance at the pump inlet. The stability limits and chugging frequencies proved to be strongly dependent on the degree of feed-system coupling. The maximum stability condition occurred with intermediate coupling. Under conditions of a high degree of feed-system-combustor coupling, the stability limits and chugging frequencies were primarily dependent on the feed-system characteristics; the responses were characterized by beating patterns. For the system analyzed, the <b>pump</b> suction <b>line</b> had little effect on the stability limits or chugging frequencies. Beating, present under the condition of near zero injector -dome compliance, was eliminated when the suction line was decoupled by employing a sufficiently high value of pump-inlet compliance. Under conditions of maximum feed-system coupling, the magnitude and distribution of line losses in the <b>discharge</b> <b>line</b> had a significant effect on the stability limits but had negligible effect on the chugging frequency and beating characteristics. Also, the length of the <b>discharge</b> <b>line</b> greatly affected the stability limits, chugging frequency, and beating characteristics.
