25|$|This effect {{occurred}} during the Great Recession of 2007–2009, when total income going to the bottom 99 percent of Americans declined by 11.6%, but fell by 36.3% for the top 1%. Declines were especially steep for capital gains, which fell by 75% in real (inflation-adjusted) terms between 2007 and 2009. Other sources of capital income also fell: interest income by 40% and <b>dividend</b> <b>income</b> by 33%. Wages, the largest source of income, fell by a more modest 6%.|$|E
25|$|In 1895 the United States Supreme Court, in its {{ruling in}} Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., held a tax based on {{receipts}} {{from the use}} of property to be unconstitutional. The Court held that taxes on rents from real estate, on interest income from personal property and other income from personal property (which includes <b>dividend</b> <b>income)</b> were treated as direct taxes on property, and therefore had to be apportioned (divided among the states based on their populations). Since apportionment of income taxes is impractical, this had the effect of prohibiting a federal tax on income from property. However, the Court affirmed that the Constitution did not deny Congress the power to impose a tax on real and personal property, and it affirmed that such would be a direct tax. Due to the political difficulties of taxing individual wages without taxing income from property, a federal income tax was impractical {{from the time of the}} Pollock decision until the time of ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment (below).|$|E

2500|$|Short selling is {{sometimes}} referred to as a [...] "negative income investment strategy" [...] because there is no potential for <b>dividend</b> <b>income</b> or interest income. Stock is held only long enough to be sold pursuant to the contract, and one's return is therefore limited to short term capital gains, which are taxed as ordinary income. For this reason, buying shares (called [...] "going long") has a very different risk profile from selling short. [...] Furthermore, a [...] "long's" [...] losses are limited because the price can only go down to zero, but gains are not, as there is no limit, in theory, on how high the price can go. [...] On the other hand, the short seller's possible gains are limited to the original price of the stock, which can only go down to zero, whereas the loss potential, again in theory, has no limit. [...] For this reason, short selling probably is most often used as a hedge strategy to manage the risks of long investments.|$|E
2500|$|The quoted {{language}} {{regarding the}} [...] "complete and plenary power of income taxation possessed by Congress from the beginning" [...] is {{a reference to}} the power granted to Congress by the original text of Article I of the U.S. Constitution. The reference to [...] "being taken out of the category of indirect taxation to which it [...] belonged" [...] is {{a reference to the}} effect of the 1895 Court decision in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., where taxes on income from property (such as interest income and <b>dividend</b> <b>income)</b> – which, like taxes on income from labor, had always been considered indirect taxes (and therefore not subject to the apportionment rule) – were, beginning in 1895, treated as direct taxes. The Sixteenth Amendment overruled the effect of Pollock, making the source of the income irrelevant with respect to the apportionment rule, and thereby placing taxes on income from property back into the category of indirect taxes such as income from labor (the Sixteenth Amendment expressly stating that Congress has power to impose income taxes regardless of the source of the income, without apportionment among the states, and without regard to any census or enumeration).|$|E
2500|$|The President {{informed}} Government that he {{had been}} told that net investment income (NII) should be classified as current reserves, though he was not certain as he was not an accountant. The Government, having taken the Attorney-General's advice on the matter, said that NII was correctly treated as current income, as it is the interest and <b>dividend</b> <b>income</b> earned from investing the Government's reserves, less expenses on investment and debt servicing. It does not include capital gains or losses from the disposal of investments, which are regarded as investment adjustments. Since the Constitution provides that the President has only custodial powers over past reserves, these powers do not extend to NII as they are accumulated during the current term of office of the Government, even when the NII stems from the investment of past reserves that are themselves [...] "locked up". Nonetheless, the Government would take into consideration a suggestion from the President and the CPA to lock away half of the NII derived from past reserves as past reserves. In 2001, as indicated above, the Government amended the Constitution to redefine how NII should be treated.|$|E

40|$|Civil wars {{dramatically}} reduce income. Peace might {{therefore be}} expected to generate a dividend which both {{the government and the}} private sector can spend. Paradoxically, those civil wars which are prolonged and therefore do most damage create only small instant peace <b>dividends.</b> <b>Income</b> has fallen because capital has been lost and so cannot recover until capital has been reaccumulated. However, some of the capital losses are reverable. Once confidence in a secure environment is restored there is a delayed peace dividend as private capital is repatriated and `social capital' is rebuilt. Postwar governments should therefore focus not upon how to spend an illusory early dividend, but on how to restore private confidence. ...|$|R
50|$|In Canada, {{there is}} {{taxation}} of dividends, which is compensated by a {{dividend tax credit}} (DTC) for personal <b>income</b> in <b>dividends</b> from Canadian corporations. An increase to the DTC was announced {{in the fall of}} 2005 in conjunction with the announcement that Canadian income trusts would not become subject to dividend taxation as had been feared. Effective tax rates on dividends will now range from negative to over 30% depending on income level and different provincial tax rates and credits. Starting 2012, the Government introduced the concept of eligible <b>dividends.</b> <b>Income</b> not eligible for the Small Business Deduction and therefore taxed at higher corporate tax rates, can be distributed to the shareholders and taxed at a lower personal tax rate.|$|R
