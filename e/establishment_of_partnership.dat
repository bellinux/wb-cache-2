To develop a substantive grounded theory on the process of forming academic-service partnerships in implementing clinical education, from the perspective of academic and clinical nursing staff members and managers working in Iranian settings. Methods: The participants included 15 hospital nurses, nurse managers, nurse educators, and educational managers from two central universities and clinical settings from 2009 to 2012. Data were collected through 30 in-depth, semi-structure interviews with the individual participants and then analyzed using the methodology of Strauss and Corbin’s grounded theory. Results: Utilizing “balancing power” as the core variable enabled us to integrate the concepts concerning the partnership processes between clinical and educational institutes. Three distinct and significant categories emerged to explain the process of partnership: 1) divergence, 2) conflict between educational and caring functions, and 3) creation of balance between educational and caring functions. Conclusions: In implementing clinical education, partnerships have been formed within a challenging context in Iran. Conflict between clinical and educational functions was the main concern of both sides of the partnership in forming a collaborative relationship, with our findings emphasizing the importance of nursing educators’ role in the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> programs...|$|E

As part of the peace process, the Independent Commission on Policing (ICP) reported in 1999, and since its publication policing structures in Northern Ireland have undergone considerable reform. One of the threads of the ICP was to introduce a more nodal or networked approach to the delivery of policing that included the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> policing structures.

The model is explicitly promoted as fostering a more nodal approach to local police decision making by engaging with a more diverse range of groups and harnessing the knowledge of local agencies to solve crime and disorder problems. Therefore, enhancing the accountability and legitimacy of the PSNI at the local level. In these contexts, the article utilises data taken from fieldwork undertaken at these public meetings and critically considers their role as forums where communities bring low level disorder issues that are affecting their neighbourhood to the attention of the PSNI, and whether they help solve these issues in partnership.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in a rubber farming community in Southern Thailand with rubber farmers and their first-line public healthcare providers as the study informants. The study aims were to first, explore perceived effects of work exposures in rubber farming on rubber farmers’ health, second, identify decisions made in response to the effects of work exposures on health, and third, determine influencing factors on the construction of the perception and the process of decision making. Data were obtained using ethnographic research methods, underpinned by an interpretative paradigm. Unstructured interviews and participant observation were employed as the principal means of data collection. Together with the primary methods of data collection, note taking (fieldnotes, fieldwork personal journal, and photographs) and reviewing/analysing existing documents were employed. While data were being collected, initial data analysis was carried out to make sense of information gained and direct further steps of the data collection. After terminating the data collection, ethnographic data analysis suggested by Spradley (1979, 1980) was used to determine themes to meet the aims of the study. The study findings reveal that individual rubber farmers and healthcare providers construct perceptions of effects of rubber farming on rubber farmers’ health and decisions on the actions taken to manage the rubber farmers’ work-related health problems based on their own accounts of compounding factors. Among factors identified, discrepancies between health policy and its practice, coupled with the existence of a hierarchy of power-superior-inferior relationships among individual levels of health authority-emerge as the most powerful factors, inducing the emergence of other factors. Recommendations made {{as a result of this}} study draw attention mainly to the minimisation of the discrepancies between health policies and their implications, and the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> status among authorised health agencies and between health agencies and rubber farmers in order to improve the quality of occupational safety and health services provided to the rubber farmers...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{describe}} the process followed in the development of the model of facilitating male partner involvement in reproductive health (RH) context by the nurses. Namibia is one of the African countries affected by cultural and socio-economic influences that have persuaded gender roles in a way that hinders male-partner involvement in RH context. This phenomenon make difficult for the nurses to facilitate their involvement. The research methods were done in four phases. Phase 1 entitled concepts analysis. Phase one was done into two steps namely step 1 - concepts identification and step 2 - concepts definition. During concept identification, qualitative, exploratory, descriptive design was followed. The target population included male and female partners attending health facilities and all nurse managers (registered nurses in charge) that provided RH services in the health facility in a northern region in Namibia. Individual interviews and focus were conducted until data saturation occurred. During the research three fundamental principles such as respect person, beneficence and justice were adhered. Tech’s eight steps of descriptive data analysis were used. Three (3) main categories, six (6) categories and twelve (12) subcate-gories were identified using open coding and conceptualization. The main concepts of the model were identified and classified using a survey list of Dickoff, James, Wiedenba (Dickoff,James, Wiedenbach, 1968; Mckenna, 2006). Phase 2 dealt with the creation of interre-lationship statements between concepts identified in step 1.

40|$|The {{title of}} the {{research}} is Sustainability Performance Evaluation Management Systems Model for Individual Organizations and Supply Chains. This research has achieved its aim to develop and demonstrate the practical implementation of a simple and objective sustainability performance evaluation management system model for individual organizations and supply chains. It {{has resulted in the}} recognition that a new concept – Network of Interested Partners – underpins the achievement of sustainability. The term acknowledges the interdependence and reflects the essential cooperation that must be achieved between business organisations, their commercially related entities and the local community if progress towards sustainability is to be achieved. It therefore encompasses and extends the concept of a supply chain as currently used. Sustainable Development is defined by the World Commission on Environment and Development as development, which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future societies to meet their own needs. Organizations, as part of human activities, also have to be sustainable. The sustainability of organizations is directly linked to the continual improvement of business performance. Many organizations {{have found a way to}} improve performance through the establishment of management systems. International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards are recognized worldwide as reliable and efficient tools for the implementation of management systems. However, they do not always result in the desired improvement in outcomes. Therefore, if the required improvement of business performance is to be achieved, improved methodologies for development and implementation of performance evaluation (PE) processes are necessary. These methodologies must take into consideration sustainability principles. They also have to be applicable to individual entities and supply chains, with or without management systems in place. Supply chains are important because it is being increasingly recognized that overall supply chain performance is a means of adding value and competitive advantage to all businesses. In the first part of the research a performance evaluation model or PE (version 1 model) was developed. This was used as criteria to compare and evaluate existing performance evaluation processes and outcomes of individual organisations and their respective supply chain within the Gladstone region, Australia. Questionnaires have also been used to identify and evaluate the needs of the interested parties in relation to the organizations’ and supply chains’ business performance and processes of performance evaluation. All the information provided in the first part of the research was used by the researcher to develop the Sustainability Performance Evaluation Management Systems model or SPEMS (version 2 model). This incorporates the concepts of Network of Interested Parties/Partners. In particular, one of the outcomes is recognition that organizations need to establish partnerships if effective supply chain performance improvement is to be achieved. Therefore the establishment of partnerships has become a key requirement for the implementation of SPEMS. The <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> among participants of a supply chain of Gladstone and implementation of the eight first steps of the SPEMS (version 2 model) in this supply chain was commenced successfully through workshops. The supply chain was formed by commercial organizations, government entities and interested parties from the community. SPEMS requires that partners all have the same level of ownership and authority in the decisions of the supply chain. Some new terms and their definitions have been created within the research to support the new SPEMS model. They include: Network of Interested Partners, sustainability for organizations, sustainability KPI and sustainability friendly organizations. All of the above are encompassed within the final SPEMS (version 3 model) ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{and reflects}} on the partnership between Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and Community-Based Organisations (CBOs) in implementing development projects in Mozambique. This is a qualitative case study, whose methods of data collection were in-depth semi-structured interviews and document analysis. The {{study was conducted with}} two NGOs (one international and one national) and with four CBOs and it took place in Nampula and Gaza provinces and the capital Maputo. The data were analyzed using quantitative method. NGOs and CBOs are different entities in terms of their levels of actuation, responsibilities, nature, and also differ in terms of resources, such as access to information, funding sources and human resources. These differences have raised questions around the possibility of the establishment of an equitable and properly functioning partnership between entities that differ so much in naure. The NGOs depend majorly on external funds to support the CBOs; however they also rely on their own funds or funds made available by local funders' institutions. Equally, the CBOs also undertake, some income activity generation, whose income is used for their own institutional expenses and also to support some community needs, though they rely mostly on funds provided by the NGOs. The central idea {{of this study is that}} despite the differences between NGOs and CBOs they can establish a balanced partnership based on the recognition of the contribution of each partner and on the significance both attribute to the partnership. The differences constitute the basis of the partnership which in turn allows the acquisition of mutual benefits, recognition and sharing of power. In terms of theoretical framework, I have used Agency theory wherein the NGO is the "Principal" which in a relationship governed by a contract delegates the CBOs as the "Agent" of the implementation of projects in the communities. vii The results showed that the partnership between NGOs and CBOs is characterised by complementarities, mutual benefits, exchange, contribution, and sharing of power by both. The partnership is also based on recognition of the weaknesses, strengths and value of each pa 1 iner which give place to a balanced partnership. However being a balanced partnership it is also characterised by conflicts that result from the difference of interest between NGOs and CBOs. Risk constitutes another element that characterizes this partnership since the NGOs delegate the CBOs the implementation of the project and not always the CBOs will perform as it is advocated in the contract. Though, as the partnership is valuable for both, NGOs and CBOs will engage in developing strategies for minimising the potential risk in order to maintain and maximise the partnership. The data also showed that the locus of conflict and risk are essentially linked to misusage of money. Since the CBOs implement the project and are institutionally independent from the NGOs, the NGOs develop some strategies of control to ensure that the CBOs will act in accordance of what the contract advocates. It is within these strategies wherein the conflict arises, especidlly because the CBOs do not always understand some of the strategies adopted by NGOs to ensure the accomplishment of the contract what led the CBOs also to adopt some strategies of resistance. In terms of power and decision-making the data showed that both exercise different kind of power and the CBOs influence the decision-making process, though the NGOs showed to have greater control over the process. The contribution of this study to the existing literature lies in the fact that it brings a different approach to the power relations between NGOs and CBOs, which is usually seen as a relationship of the exercise of power by the NGOs over the CBOs. The study seeks to show that the strategies of resistance, counter power and negotiation developed by the CBOs constitute a different form of exercise of power and influence. It also shows that the CBOs are not passive actors in the partnership because they develop strategies to influence and attract the NGOs in the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> and decision-making throughout the project cycle...|$|E
