40|$|The {{main concern}} that <b>joins</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> this {{workshop}} is income and consumption inequality, in particular, the w ll {{being of the}} poor (poverty), or less fortunate (unlucky-risk) in society. I {{have been asked to}} make some reflections regarding risk and its relationship with poverty. I will start by discussing poverty and risk at a general level using the conceptual framework of the recently developed dynamic contract theory. Then, I will argue that this conceptual framework provides an excellent tool to design and evaluate social insurance schemes. I will illustrate this point with the particular problem of unemployment insurance design, a problem I have been working in for the last several years. Consider two alternative two-peri d models useful to think about equilibrium income distributions and the relationship between efficiency and ex-post re-distributions. The first one is a model with different preferences over leisure. Thus, those with a lower marginal utility of leisure will work harder, and in equilibrium will have higher income and consumption. In this deterministic world, the solution to a Pareto problem with the competitive equilibrium weights does not require any ex-post redistribution 2. This is hardly surprising, since the first welfare theorem applies. The second one is a model with identical preferences and endowment shocks realized in the second period. If there are no contingent markets, the equilibrium will also be characterized by a non-degenerated distribution of income and consumption. In this case, as the first welfare theorem does not hold, there are efficient ex-post re-distributions. This is the case even considering the Pareto weights that replicate the competitive equilibrium. In fact, efficient ex-post re-distributions are the ones that make the variance of consumption equal to zero. 1 DO NOT QUOTE.

40|$|The {{cosmopolitan}} ideal presses us to {{look beyond}} our moral com-mitments to those near and dear, expanding the boundaries of our moral gaze outward to include those {{in other parts of}} the world. To be a cos-mopolitan is to see oneself as a part of a global community comprising all of humanity. The original articulation of the ideal, fi-om the Ancient Greeks, viewed the cosmopolitan as a 'citizen of the world ' who eschews the tendency to identify first and foremost as a member of one's local community. The notion of a global community was posited as an aspira-tional ideal rather than as a descriptive claim that an actual global coitnmunity existed. Central to cosmopolitanism is the idea that each person in the world deserves respect in virtue of his or her moral status qua human being. It is this recognition of the moral worth of all persons thait <b>joins</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> the global community endorsed by the cosmopolitan. The language of 'citizenship ' and 'community ' invites us to regard all other huitnan beings in an official capacity as bearers of rights and entitlements, as embedded in social and political relationships, and as having duties and responsibilities towards others. Beginning from this image of intercon-nectedness, the cosmopolitan pushes us to recognize that by the same logic grounding our relationship and commitments to our compatriots we are similarly positioned to all of humanity. Discussion of the cosmopolitan ideal has been reinvigorated in recent years. Undoubtedly, this renewed interest stems at least in part from the growing sense of a tangible global community to which we all belong. No longer just an abstract constmct, we have before us a global community marked by extensive cross-border interaction. Global interaction is by no means a new phenomenon. Relations of trade, colonialism, and conquest stretch back millennia. Yet the ability individuals today possess to impact distant others is greater in terms of magnitude, immediacy, and perva-siveness than in times past. Appreciation of this community has naturally spawned an inquiry into the reasons for and against extending concems o...|$|E
