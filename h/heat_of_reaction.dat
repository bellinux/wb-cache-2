50|$|Closely {{analogous}} considerations {{apply in}} chemical and nuclear considerations. Exothermic chemical reactions in closed systems {{do not change}} mass, but become less massive once the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>reaction</b> is removed, though this mass change is much too small to measure with standard equipment. In nuclear reactions, however, the fraction of mass that may be removed as light or heat, i.e., binding energy, is often a much larger fraction of the system mass. It may thus be measured directly as a mass difference between rest masses of reactants and (cooled) products. This is because nuclear forces are comparatively stronger than the Coulombic forces associated with the interactions between electrons and protons, that generate heat in chemistry.|$|E
