[...] This can be very significant if the input voltage is small, such as a low-voltage battery. [...] With ideal switching elements the output is an <b>integral</b> <b>multiple</b> of the input (two for a doubler) but with a single-cell battery as the input source and MOSFET switches the output will be far less than this value since much of the voltage will be dropped across the transistors. [...] For a circuit using discrete components the Schottky diode would be a better choice of switching element for its extremely low voltage drop in the on state. [...] However, integrated circuit designers prefer to use the easily available MOSFET and compensate for its inadequacies with increased circuit complexity.Yuan, 14-21 ...|$|E

2500|$|Example: Suppose {{that the}} {{manifold}} is the circle (thought of as R/Z), and D is the operator d/dx − λ for some complex constant λ. (This is the simplest {{example of an}} elliptic operator.) Then the kernel is the space of multiples of exp(λx) if λ is an <b>integral</b> <b>multiple</b> of 2πi and is 0 otherwise, and the kernel of the adjoint is a similar space with λ replaced by its complex conjugate. [...] So D has index 0. This example shows that the kernel and cokernel of elliptic operators can jump discontinuously as the elliptic operator varies, {{so there is no}} nice formula for their dimensions in terms of continuous topological data. However the jumps in the dimensions of the kernel and cokernel are the same, so the index, given by the difference of their dimensions, does vary continuously, and can be given in terms of topological data by the index theorem.|$|E
