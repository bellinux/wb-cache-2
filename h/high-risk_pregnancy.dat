25|$|Medical {{doctors who}} {{practice}} obstetrics include categorically specialized obstetricians, family practitioners and general practitioners whose training, skills and practices include obstetrics, {{and in some}} contexts general surgeons. These physicians and surgeons variously provide care across the whole spectrum of normal and abnormal births and pathological labour conditions. Categorically specialized obstetricians are qualified surgeons, so they can undertake surgical procedures relating to childbirth. Some family practitioners or general practitioners also perform obstetrical surgery. Obstetrical procedures include cesarean sections, episiotomies, and assisted delivery. Categorical specialists in obstetrics are commonly dually trained in obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN), and may provide other medical and surgical gynecological care, and may incorporate more general, well-woman, primary care elements in their practices. Maternal-fetal medicine specialists are obstetrician/gynecologists subspecialized in managing and treating <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and delivery.|$|E

500|$|The couple {{end their}} {{engagement}} after Melanie discovers that Derwin {{had sex with}} a singer. She considers returning to medical school rather than continue [...] "life as a football girlfriend". Following their break-up, Melanie has sex with several men, and Derwin impregnates another woman. Melanie struggles to balance her career with her personal life. Even though Melanie and Derwin have relationships with other people, they still have feelings for each other. Melanie eventually reconciles with Derwin, and the couple marry. She has a strained relationship with her stepson, as she views him as a reminder of Derwin's past infidelity. As a result, Derwin considers her to be an unfit parent and allows her only limited contact with the child. During this time, Melanie reveals to Derwin that she had an abortion, suffering from complications that greatly reduced her chances of conceiving children naturally. She made the decision as she felt that having a child by another man would permanently ruin her relationship with Derwin. At the end of the show's fifth season, Melanie and Derwin move to Baltimore after he is traded to play for a team based in the city, and she finally enrolls at Johns Hopkins University. In her return to The Game in the series' finale, Melanie nears the end of a <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and gives birth to twins.|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 -D) {{ultrasound}} (US) {{has greatly}} improved evaluation of organ circulation. The {{aim of this}} study was to explore the possible use of this new technique in normal and <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> Fetal brain, lung and placenta 3 -D power Doppler signal intensity were recorded in 115 normal singleton pregnancies (24 to 42 weeks gestation) and in 67 <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> Mean image pixel signal intensity was calculated for each organ and a brain-lung ratio. In normal pregnancy, placental and lung signal intensity increased until 33, with a rapid decrease after 38, weeks of gestation. Fetal cerebral signal intensity increased with gestational age. Placental and fetal lung signal intensity was significantly lower in <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies</b> than in the control group, with increased fetal brain and brain-lung ratios. The present results suggest a reduction of placental perfusion after 38 weeks of gestation in normal pregnancy, with redistribution of fetal circulation. Lung signal intensity increased abruptly at 32 weeks of gestation, which might reflect lung maturity. The new method showed signs of centralization of fetal circulation at the end of gestation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} cerebral velocimetry {{as a predictor of}} perinatal outcome in <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> METHODS: Middle cerebral artery pulsatility index was measured in 576 <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies</b> undergoing umbilical velocimetry. The results of both tests were evaluated with respect to the birth of small for gestational age (SGA) infants and adverse perinatal outcome, defined as perinatal death, cesarean delivery for fetal distress, or low Apgar score. RESULTS: Once umbilical velocimetry was taken into account, cerebral velocimetry did not improve the prediction of fetal growth restriction or adverse perinatal outcome. Neither test was able to predict adverse perinatal outcome in normally grown fetuses. As for SGA fetuses with adverse perinatal outcome, the simultaneous assessment of both umbilical and cerebral velocimetry did not improve diagnostic accuracy (kappa index 0. 37 versus 0. 41 for umbilical velocimetry only). However, within the group of <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies</b> with abnormal umbilical velocimetry, the risk of being SGA and having an adverse perinatal outcome was doubled (relative risk 2. 1, 95 % confidence interval 1. 1, 4. 3) if cerebral velocimetry also was abnormal. CONCLUSION: The routine use of cerebral velocimetry in <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies</b> adds little information beyond that obtained from umbilical velocimetry; however, it is useful in predicting SGA infants with adverse perinatal outcome when umbilical velocimetry is abnormal...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: {{to analyse}} {{the effects of}} {{relaxation}} as a nursing intervention on the depression levels of hospitalised women with <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> Methods: a randomised clinical trial realised in a reference centre for <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> The sample consisted of 50 women with <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies</b> (25 {{in the control group}} and 25 in the intervention group). The Benson relaxation technique was applied to the intervention group for five days. Control variables were collected using a predesigned form, and the signs and symptoms of depression were evaluated using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 20. 0, was used with a significance level of 5 %. The Wilcoxon and paired t-tests were used to evaluate depression levels between two timepoints. Using categorical data, the McNemar test was used to analyse differences in depression severity before and after the intervention. Results: depression levels decreased in the intervention group five days after the relaxation technique was applied (4. 5 ± 3, p< 0. 05) compared with the levels at the first timepoint (10. 3 ± 5. 9). Conclusion: as a nursing intervention, relaxation was effective in decreasing the symptoms of depression in hospitalised women with <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Antenatal care in {{teaching}} hospitals of Pakistan aims to identify <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and {{to educate the}} trainee doctors and paramedics.

40|$|Background: Screening and {{monitoring}} in pregnancy are strategies used by healthcare providers to identify <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies</b> {{so that they}} can provide more targeted and appropriate treatment and follow-up care, and to monitor fetal well-being in both low- and <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> The use of many of these techniques is controversial and their ability to detect fetal compromise often unknown. Theoretically, appropriate management of maternal and fetal risk factors and complications that are detected in pregnancy and labour could prevent {{a large proportion of the}} world's 3. 2 million estimated annual stillbirths, as well as minimise maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Methods: The fourth in a series of papers assessing the evidence base for prevention of stillbirths, this paper reviews available published evidence for the impact of 14 screening {{and monitoring}} interventions in pregnancy on stillbirth, including identification and management of <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies,</b> advanced monitoring techniques, and monitoring of labour.

40|$|Studies on fetal lung/brain {{circulation}} {{by means}} of power Doppler technique have suggested a marked reduction in lung perfusion in <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies</b> {{as a sign of}} circulation redistribution. The ratio between lung/brain perfusion might therefore give a new method to predict fetal circulation centralization. Objective: The aim {{of the present study was}} to obtain fetal lung and cerebral artery ratio in normal and <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> Study design: Doppler samples from proximal right pulmonary artery blood velocities and middle cerebral artery (MCA) were recorded cross-sectionally in 228 normal singleton pregnancies at gestational age 22 to 40 weeks. MCA / right pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PO ratio was calculated. Doppler samples from proximal right pulmonary artery and MCA were also recorded in 89 <b>high-risk</b> singleton <b>pregnancies</b> and the results related to perinatal outcome. Results: In the normal controls, right pulmonary artery PI remained stable until 30 weeks of gestation with slight increase thereafter until term. The MCA to right pulmonary artery PI ratio increased between 22 and 28 weeks of gestation with the rapid fall towards term. In the <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies</b> group, right pulmonary artery PI showed no significant correlation to perinatal outcome, but signs of brain-sparing in the MCA were correlated to all adverse outcome parameters.

40|$|Introduction: Women {{consider}} factors including {{safety and}} the psychological impact of their chosen location when deciding whether to give birth in hospital or at home. The {{same is true for}} women with <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies</b> who may plan homebirths against medical advice. This study investigated women’s decision-making during <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> Half the participants were planning hospital births and half were planning homebirths. Methods: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews set in a hospital maternity department in the UK. Twenty-six participants with <b>high-risk</b> <b>pregnancies,</b> at least 32 weeks pregnant. Results were analysed using systematic thematic analysis. Results: Three themes emerged: perceptions of birth at home and hospital; beliefs about how birth should be; and the decision process. Both groups were concerned about safety but they expressed different concerns. Women drew psychological comfort from their chosen birth location. Women planning homebirths displayed faith in the natural birth process and stressed the quality of the birth experience. Women planning hospital births believed the access to medical care outweighed their misgivings about the physical environment. Discussion: Although women from both groups expressed similar concerns about safety they reached different decisions about how these should be addressed regarding birth location. These differences may be related to beliefs about the birth process. Commitment to their decisions may have helped reduce cognitive stress...|$|R
