5|$|Gebhard clearly {{intended}} to transform an important ecclesiastical territory into a secular, dynastic duchy. This problematic conversion would then bring {{the principle of}} cuius regio, eius religio into play in the Electorate. Under this principle, all of Gebhard's subjects {{would be required to}} convert to his faith: his rule, <b>his</b> <b>religion.</b> Furthermore, as a relatively young man, heirs would be expected. Gebhard and his young wife presented the very real possibility of successfully converting a rich, diplomatically important and strategically placed ecclesiastical territory of a prince-prelate into a dynastic territory that carried with it one of the coveted offices of imperial elector.|$|E

5|$|Shahîd further {{argues that}} the facts of Philip's alleged Christianity would also {{discourage}} Eusebius from celebrating that emperor.

In Shahîd's view, the insignificance of his reign to the progress of Christianity, Eusebius' subject, combined with Eusebius' role as Constantine's panegyrist, explain the tone and content of his account.|$|E

5|$|After Leif's {{first trip}} to Vinland, he {{returned}} to the family estate of Brattahlíð in Greenland, and started preaching Christianity to the Greenlanders. His father Erik reacted coldly to the suggestion that he should abandon <b>his</b> <b>religion,</b> while his mother Thjóðhildr quickly became a Christian and built a church called Thjóðhild's Church. Leif is last mentioned alive in 1019, and by 1025 he had passed on his chieftaincy of Eiríksfjǫrðr to another son, Thorkell. Nothing is mentioned about his death in the sagas—he probably died in Greenland some time between these dates. Nothing further is known about his family beyond the succession of Thorkell as chieftain.|$|E
5|$|At {{its most}} fundamental, {{it was a}} local feud between two {{competing}} dynastic interests—the Seneschals (Truchsess) of the House of Waldburg and the dukes of the House of Wittelsbach—that acquired religious overtones. The dispute had broad implications in the political, social, and dynastic balance of the Holy Roman Empire. It tested the principle of ecclesiastical reservation established in the religious Peace of Augsburg (1555). The 1555 agreement settled religious problems in the Empire with the principle Cuius regio, eius religio: the subjects of a secular prince followed the religion of their sovereign. Ecclesiastical reservation excluded the territories of the imperial prelates (bishops, archbishops, abbots or abbesses) from cuius regio, eius religio. In an ecclesiastical territory, if the prelate changed <b>his</b> <b>religion,</b> his subjects {{did not have to}} do so. Instead, the prelate was expected to resign from his post. Problematically, the 1555 agreement did not specify this detail.|$|E
5|$|Beebe {{described}} his religious beliefs {{as a combination}} of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. <b>His</b> <b>religion</b> was largely the result of seeking to combine his sense of awe and wonder at the natural world with a scientific understanding of its workings.

Beebe also disapproved of the eugenic ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some of his contemporaries at the zoo, although this was largely {{out of fear that}} these ideas would alienate friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.|$|E

5|$|In 1782, the Tây Sơn {{attacked}} Gia Định (later {{known as}} Saigon and now Ho Chi Minh City) again and forced Nguyễn Ánh {{to flee to}} the island of Phú Quốc under Duyệt's escort. It {{was one of many}} times when Gia Định changed hands. In 1787, Duyệt began organizing and commanding his own unit, and individually recruited his own enlisted men. In 1788, the tide began to turn in favour of the Nguyễn, after Pigneau de Behaine, a French Catholic priest who befriended Nguyễn Ánh {{in the hope that the}} young prince would gain power and give special privileges to <b>his</b> <b>religion,</b> recruited French military officers to fight for the Nguyễn. In 1788, the Nguyễn recaptured Gia Định and never relinquished it again. From then on, Nguyễn Ánh transformed the city into a fortress and his powerbase and began consolidating his hold on the surrounding area, before attacking the Tây Sơn with a view to eliminating them.|$|E
5|$|Motives for {{collection}} of articles, such as Tipu's Tiger, are seen by literary historian Barrett Kalter {{as having a}} social and cultural context. The {{collection of}} Western and Indian art by Tipu Sultan is seen by Kalter as motivated {{by the need to}} display his wealth and legitimise his authority over his subjects who were predominantly Hindu and did not share <b>his</b> <b>religion,</b> viz. Islam. In the case of the East India Company, collection of documents, artefacts and objet's d'art from India helped develop the idea of a subjugated Indian populace {{in the minds of the}} British people, the thought being that the possession of such objects of a culture represented understanding of, dominance over, and mastery of that culture.|$|E

5|$|The UK case of R. (Ghai) v. Newcastle City Council (2009) is {{therefore}} interesting {{for purposes of}} comparison. The claimant, an orthodox Hindu, applied to his local authority for land to be dedicated for traditional open air funeral pyres. The local authority refused the request, relying on subsidiary legislation that made it an offence to burn human remains other than in a crematorium. The claimant then applied for judicial review, submitting that the decision infringed his right to manifest <b>his</b> <b>religion</b> or belief which was protected by Article 9(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights. The High Court found that the statutory interference with the claimant's right was justified as {{it was necessary for}} the protection of public morals and of the rights and freedoms of others. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment on grounds unrelated to Article 9, holding that open air pyres were permissible on a proper construction of the legislation.|$|E
5|$|Written {{at a time}} of {{religious}} upheaval, and {{in the wake of the}} English Reformation, the play is alternately Catholic (or piously medieval) and Protestant (or consciously modern). The ghost describes himself as being in purgatory, and as dying without last rites. This and Ophelia's burial ceremony, which is characteristically Catholic, make up most of the play's Catholic connections. Some scholars have observed that revenge tragedies come from traditionally Catholic countries, such as Spain and Italy, where they present a contradiction of motives, since according to Catholic doctrine the duty to God and family precedes civil justice. Hamlet's conundrum, then, is whether to avenge his father and kill Claudius, or to leave the vengeance to God, as <b>his</b> <b>religion</b> requires.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Eisenberg {{appeared}} in Cursed, a horror film directed by Wes Craven, and The Squid and the Whale, a well-reviewed independent drama starring Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels.

Homer wakes up but quickly succumbs to the thick smoke and faints. Apu, chief of Springfield's volunteer fire department, rushes to the Simpson house with other firefighters including Krusty the Clown, Chief Wiggum, and Barney. Meanwhile, Ned runs into the burning house to rescue Homer and pulls him out just as the firefighters arrive. After the fire is out, Homer declares that God was delivering vengeance. Reverend Lovejoy counters that God was working through the hearts of Homer's friends, despite their different faiths. Homer agrees to give church another try and the next Sunday is there, albeit snoring loudly through the service.

5|$|The Bahá'ís, {{including}} Bahá'u'lláh and his family, left Adrianople on 12 August 1868, and, after {{a journey}} by {{land and sea}} through Gallipoli and Egypt, arrived in Acre on 31 August and were confined in the barracks in the citadel in the city. The inhabitants of Acre {{were told that the}} new prisoners were enemies of the state, of God and <b>his</b> <b>religion,</b> and that association with them was strictly forbidden. The first years in Acre imposed very harsh conditions with many becoming sick, and eventually three Bahá'ís dying. Dr. Thomas Chaplin, director of a British Hospital in Jerusalem visited Bahá'u'lláh in April 1871 and {{sent a letter to the}} editor printed in The Times in October. This seems to be the first extended commentary on Bahá'u'lláh in western newspapers. It was also a very trying time for Bahá'u'lláh, whose son, Mirzá Mihdí, died at the age of twenty-two when he fell through a skylight while pacing back and forth in prayer and meditation. After some time, relations between the prisoners and officials and the local community improved, so that the conditions of the imprisonment were eased and eventually, after the Sultan's death, Bahá'u'lláh was allowed to leave the city and visit nearby places. From 1877 until 1879 Bahá'u'lláh lived in the house of Mazra'ih.|$|E
