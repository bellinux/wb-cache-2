5|$|Although {{the species}} was first named in 1904, it was {{included}} in Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) until molecular studies, first published in 2006, demonstrated that the two are distinct species. M.escalerai is most closely related to an unnamed species from Morocco. Unlike M.nattereri, which lives in small groups in tree holes, M.escalerai forms large colonies <b>in</b> <b>caves.</b> Females start to aggregate in late spring in maternity colonies, and their young are born in summer. The species spends each winter in hibernation colonies, usually <b>in</b> <b>caves</b> or basements.|$|E

5|$|Crickets {{are found}} in many habitats. Members of several subfamilies {{are found in}} the upper tree canopy, in bushes, and among grasses and herbs. They also occur on the ground and <b>in</b> <b>caves,</b> and some are subterranean, {{excavating}} shallow or deep burrows. Some make galleries in rotting wood, and certain beach-dwelling species can run and jump over the surface of pools.|$|E

5|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat roosts <b>in</b> <b>caves</b> in {{limestone}} hills, {{far from}} the entrance. While many caves contain only 10 to 15 individuals, the average group size is 100, with a maximum of about 500. Individuals roost high on walls or roof domes, far apart from each other. Bats also undertake seasonal migration between caves.|$|E

5|$|Adult hawksbill {{sea turtles}} are {{primarily}} found in tropical coral reefs. They are usually seen resting <b>in</b> <b>caves</b> and ledges {{in and around}} these reefs throughout the day. As a highly migratory species, they inhabit {{a wide range of}} habitats, from the open ocean to lagoons and even mangrove swamps in estuaries. Little is known about the habitat preferences of early life-stage E. imbricata; like other young sea turtles, they are assumed to be completely pelagic, remaining at sea until they mature.|$|E
5|$|Neanderthals {{are known}} to have lived <b>in</b> <b>caves</b> around the Rock of Gibraltar; in 1848 the first known adult Neanderthal skull, and only the second Neanderthal fossil ever found, was {{excavated}} at Forbes' Quarry on the north face of the Rock. Had the skull been recognised for what it was, the species might have been named Gibraltarians rather than Neanderthals. The date of the skull is unclear but it has been attributed to around the start of the last glacial period about 50,000 years ago.|$|E

5|$|Relatively {{little is}} known of the biology of M.escalerai. Females begin to form {{reproductive}} colonies in April and May, either small ones or larger aggregations that may also contain males. However, most males remain solitary in this period, although some also form colonies. The single young is born in June or July and becomes independent after some six weeks. Mating usually takes place in fall, but sometimes in winter. The formation of large reproductive colonies <b>in</b> <b>caves,</b> which may consist of several hundreds of individuals, distinguishes M.escalerai from M.nattereri as well as M.sp.A, which roost in smaller groups in tree holes. In Aragón, colonies contain 50 to 880 individuals, and Catalan colonies are known to contain over a hundred bats. Reproductive colonies may be formed {{in a variety of}} structures, including caves, mines, tree holes, and human-made structures such as bridges and houses. However, hibernation colonies need constant temperatures between , and are usually located <b>in</b> <b>caves</b> or basements. M.escalerai is considered a sedentary species, and does not usually migrate over long distances, although it does move between reproduction and hibernation colonies. Rabies has been identified in a Spanish specimen of M.escalerai.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals are}} {{coloured}} purely incidentally because their blood contains pigments. For example, amphibians like the olm that live <b>in</b> <b>caves</b> may be largely colourless as colour has no function in that environment, but they show some red {{because of the}} haem pigment in their red blood cells, needed to carry oxygen. They also have a little orange coloured riboflavin in their skin. Human albinos and people with fair skin have a similar colour for the same reason.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the first}} {{settlers}} lived <b>in</b> <b>caves</b> dug {{out of the river}} bank, but the city grew with construction of homes, churches, and wharves. The new landowners did not share Penn's vision of a non-congested city. Most people bought land along the Delaware River instead of spreading westward towards the Schuylkill. The lots they bought were subdivided and resold with smaller streets constructed between them. Before 1704, few people lived west of Fourth Street.|$|E

5|$|The Yavapai built brush shelter {{dwellings}} called Wa'm bu nya:va (Wom-boo-nya-va). In summer, {{they built}} simple lean-tos without walls. During winter months, closed huts (called uwas) {{would be built}} of ocotillo branches or other wood and covered with animal skins, grasses, bark, and/or dirt. In the Colorado River area, Ɖo:lkabaya built Uwađ a'mađva, a rectangular hut, that had dirt piled up against its sides for insulation, and a flat roof. They also sought shelter <b>in</b> <b>caves</b> or abandoned pueblos to escape the cold.|$|E
5|$|The current {{whereabouts}} of the holotype beak are unknown. It may be specimen UMZC 575, a rostrum {{that was sent}} from Milne-Edwards to the English zoologist Alfred Newton after 1880, which matches the drawing and description in Milne-Edwards' paper, but this cannot be confirmed. In 1893 the ornithologists Edward Newton (brother of Alfred) and Hans Gadow described more fossils of the Rodrigues parrot, including a skull and limb bones. Remains of the species are scarce, and subfossils have been discovered <b>in</b> <b>caves</b> on the Plaine Corail and in Caverne Tortue.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} Miniopterus mahafaliensis extends through southwestern Madagascar in the spiny forest and dry forest, often {{but not always}} near caves; {{it has been found}} on the Mahafaly Plateau, in the Forêt des Mikea, and the Kirindy Mitea National Park. Further inland, it has been found in {{disturbed}} gallery forest in Isalo National Park, in a cave in savanna habitat near Ihosy, and in unspecified habitat at Betroka. Little is known of the ecology of M.mahafaliensis, but species of Miniopterus generally feed on insects, breed seasonally, and roost in large colonies <b>in</b> <b>caves.</b>|$|E

5|$|The western rock {{nuthatch}} builds an elaborate flask-shaped nest from mud, dung and hair or feathers, and decorates the nest's exterior and nearby crevices with feathers and insect wings. The nests are located in rock crevices, <b>in</b> <b>caves,</b> under cliff overhangs or on buildings. The eastern {{rock nuthatch}} builds a similar but less complex structure across {{the entrance to a}} cavity. Its nest can be quite small but may weigh up to 32kg (70lb). This species will also nest in river banks or tree holes and will enlarge its nest hole if it the cavity is too small.|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis prefers lowland {{habitats}} (in Switzerland {{it occurs}} up to 275 m a.s.l.) and calcium-rich waters. This small snail inhabits {{the central and}} lower parts of rivers (up to 13 m deep), including in brackish water in tidal rivers of estuaries. It sometimes lives in lakes on unvegetated bottoms. Rarely, it lives in springs (rheocrenes), in ground water, and <b>in</b> <b>caves.</b> For example, in the Åland Islands, Theodoxus fluviatilis was found living in lakes with a pH of 7.8–8.9. In streams and rivers in Ireland, the species lived in water with a pH of 7.0–8.4.|$|E
5|$|Animals may avoid {{becoming}} prey {{by living}} {{out of sight of}} predators, whether <b>in</b> <b>caves,</b> underground, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.|$|E
