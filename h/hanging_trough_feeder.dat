40|$|A {{total of}} 288 pigs (PIC TR 4 × 1050, {{initially}} 82 lb) {{were used in}} a 91 -d study to evaluate the effects of <b>feeder</b> <b>trough</b> space (1. 75 vs. 3. 5 in/pig) and minimum feeder-gap opening of 0. 5 in. (narrow), vs. 1. 0 in. (wide) on finisher pig performance. Our hypothesis was that at minimal <b>feeder</b> <b>trough</b> space (1. 75 in. /pig), feeders should be set at a wide gap opening to avoid limiting feed intake and ADG. The feeders were adjusted to the minimum gap setting, but the agitation plate could be moved upward to a maximum gap opening of 0. 75 in. or 1. 25 in., respectively. The treatments were arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial with 6 replications per treatment. All pens had the same feeder with 2, 14 -in. -wide by 4. 5 -in. -deep <b>feeder</b> holes. <b>Feeder</b> <b>trough</b> space was adjusted by placing 8 or 16 pigs per pen. Gating was adjusted to give each pig 8 ft 2 of floor space. Pigs had ad libitum access to feed and water. All pigs were fed a corn-soybean meal-based diet containing 20 % dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) in 4 phases. Pen weights and feed disappearance were measured every 2 wk. Narrow-adjusted feeders averaged approximately 48 % coverage, and wide-adjusted feeders averaged approximately 85 % coverage. Overall (d 0 to 91) there were no <b>trough</b> space × <b>feeder</b> adjustment interactions observed (P > 0. 10). However, there was a tendency (P = 0. 08) for increased ADG as <b>feeder</b> <b>trough</b> space increased from 1. 75 to 3. 5 in. /pig. Pigs fed with the wide feeder-gap setting had increased (P < 0. 01) feed disappearance and poorer (P < 0. 01) F/G compared to pigs with the narrow feeder-gap setting. These results suggest that, regardless of <b>feeder</b> <b>trough</b> space, pigs with the wide feeder adjustment appeared to waste more feed, {{as evidenced by the}} poorer F/G...|$|R

40|$|The {{failure of}} adrenalectomized mice {{to respond to}} {{thyroxine}} {{by an increase in}} oxygen uptake was not reversed by intramuscular injections of thiamine. Thiamine-deficient mice were found to be incapable of respond-ing to thyroxine by an increase in the metabolic rate. introduction It is well known that the injection of thyroxine into animals and birds will be followed, after a latent period, by an increase in the basal metabolic rate. Two patho¬ logical states are known in which this action of thyroxine is absent: it is not observed in pigeons suffering from thiamine deficiency (Rubino & Pennetti, 1957) nor in adrenal¬ ectomized mice (Ganju & Lockett, 1958). The object {{of the present study was}} to discover whether deficiency of thiamine abolishes the effect of thyroxine on the oxygen consumption of mice, as in birds, and to discover whether the decreased oxygen consumption of adrenalectomized mice and their failure to respond to thyroxine are related to an inability to make full use of the thiamine supplied (Marchetti, Montari & Rossi, 1955). METHODS Male white mice, weighing 20 - 30 g., were divided into groups which were kept separately in standard Boots type cages in a single room under similar conditions of lighting, temperature (21 - 24 ° c) and humidity. Bilateral adrenalectomy was performed as described by Ganju & Lockett (1958). Sham operations differed only in that the adrenals were left untouched. Diet. Unoperated and sham-operated mice drank water; adrenalectomized mice drank 0 - 4 % NaCl (w/v) in water. Diet 41 b of Stein was supplied, when used, in wire baskets.

40|$|Parasitic {{infections are}} major {{obstacle}} {{in the growth}} and development of livestock industry globally. Fascioliasis, caused by members of genus Fasciola (Platyhelminthes: Trematoda), {{is the most common}} and economically important helminth infection of livestock. A cross-sectional investigation was carried out comprising of two objectives, including the determination of some epidemiological aspects of fascioliasis in domestic sheep (Ovis aries) and domestic goats (Capra hircus), comparative evaluation of conventional parasitological and serodiagnostic techniques in district Sargodha, Pakistan. The faecal samples were collected and analyzed by using conventional faecal examination method. A coprological examination of randomly selected sheep (n= 2172) and goat (n= 2268) was performed from all the six tehsils of district Sargodha during one year (October, 2011 to September, 2012); which revealed an overall prevalence of 31. 72 % (689 / 2172) in sheep and 39. 63 % (899 / 2268) in goat. The overall prevalence of Fasciola (F.) hepatica was higher than F. gigantica in small ruminants. The prevalence of disease was significantly higher in females and younger sheep and goat as compared to that of males and adult of both species, respectively. A significant impact of season on the prevalence of disease was observed, being higher during November and lowest in April in sheep and it was higher in July and lowest in January in goat population. The magnitude of disease was significantly higher in grazers followed by ground and <b>trough</b> <b>feeders.</b> The prevalence of disease was higher in the population provided with river water followed by pond water and tap water. An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed using DRG ELISA kit. Anti-Fasciola antibodies were detected in higher percentage in serum samples collected from sheep and goat population (48. 61 % & 49. 36 % respectively) as compared to coprological examination (prevalence= 36. 46 % & 38. 78 %). DRG kit ELISA was found more specific than coprological examination when compared in Win episcope by screening of comparative diagnostics. The commercial ELISA was found more sensitive (100 %) and specific (78 %) method than the coprological examination (74 %, 68 %). The application of commercial ELISA may provide cost effective tool for early diagnosis of fascioliasis in small ruminants. Epidemiological data combined with ecological data and serological screening of small ruminant population of Sargodha will provide basis for sustainable fascioliasis control program. The results of this study may provide some useful data for GI parasite control in general and Fasciola control in small ruminants of study area...|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} for rejecting {{waste heat}} from a system located {{on or near}} the lunar equator is presented. The system utilizes a reflective catenary shaped trough deployed about a vertical radiator to shade the radiator from heat emitted by the hot lunar surface. The catenary shaped trough is constructed from a film material and is aligned relative to the sun so that incoming solar energy is focused to a line just above the vertical radiator and can thereby isolate the radiator from the effects of direct sunlight. The film is in a collapsed position between side by side support rods, all of which are in a transport case. To deploy the film and support rods, a set of parallel tracks running perpendicular to length of the support rods are extended out from the transport case. After the support tracks are deployed, the support rods are positioned equidistant from each other {{along the length of the}} support tracks so that the flexible film shade between adjacent support rods is unfolded and hangs in a catenary shaped trough. A heat radiator is supported between each pair of support rods above each <b>hanging</b> reflective <b>trough...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The feed {{must remain}} clean and dry; {{contaminated}} feed can infect poultry. Damp feed encourages fungal growth. Mycotoxin poisoning, as an example, is [...] "one {{of the most}} common and certainly most under-reported causes of toxicoses in poultry". Diseases can be avoided with proper maintenance of the feed and feeder. A feeder is the device that supplies the feed to the poultry.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryRobert D. GoodbandA {{total of}} 5, 480 pigs {{involving}} 10 experiments were conducted. Experiment 1 evaluated 3 feeder gap settings: 1. 27, 1. 91, or 2. 54 cm, while Exp. 2 evaluated {{the effects of}} <b>feeder</b> <b>trough</b> space (4. 45 vs. 8. 9 cm/pig) and minimum feeder gap opening of 1. 27 vs. 2. 54 cm. In Exp. 1, pigs fed with increasing feeder gap had decreased (linear; P < 0. 03) G:F due to increased (linear; P < 0. 02) ADFI. In Exp. 2, there was a tendency (P = 0. 08) for increased ADG as <b>feeder</b> <b>trough</b> space increased from 4. 45 to 8. 9 cm/pig. Pigs fed with the wide feeder gap setting had increased (P < 0. 01) ADFI and decreased (P < 0. 01) G:F compared to pigs with the narrow feeder gap setting. 	Experiments 3 and 4 were conducted {{to determine the effects}} of diet form (meal vs. pellet) and feeder design (conventional dry vs. wet-dry) on finisher pig performance. In Exp. 3, pigs fed pelleted diets or via a wet-dry feeder had greater (P < 0. 07 and 0. 01, respectively) ADG then those fed meal diets or with a dry feeder. Diet × feeder interactions (P < 0. 02) were observed for G:F. When pelleted diets were presented in dry feeders, G:F decreased, while no difference in G:F was observed between meal and pelleted diets presented in wet-dry feeders. In Exp. 4, pigs fed with wet-dry feeders had increased (P < 0. 02) ADG and ADFI compared to those with dry feeders, while pigs presented pelleted diets had improved (P = 0. 05) G:F compared to those presented meal diets. 	Experiments 5 to 9 were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} porcine intestinal mucosa products, PEP 2 +, Peptone 50, and PEP-NS, on the growth performance of nursery pigs. In Exp. 5, pigs fed increasing PEP 2 had increased (quadratic; P < 0. 02) overall ADG, ADFI, and G:F with the greatest response observed at 4 % PEP 2. In Exp. 6, pigs fed PEP 2 had improved (P < 0. 03) G:F compared to pigs fed select menhaden fish meal (SMFM) and increasing PEP 2 improved (quadratic; P < 0. 04) G:F with the greatest improvement seen when diets contained 4 % PEP 2. In Exp. 7 pigs fed PEP 2 +, Peptone 50 and PEP-NS had increased (P < 0. 05) ADG and ADFI compared to pigs fed a negative control diet. In Exp. 8, pigs fed diets containing 6 % SMFM, PEP 2 +, or PEP-NS had improved (P < 0. 05) ADG and ADFI compared to pigs fed the negative control or 6 % Peptone 50. In Exp. 9, pigs fed increasing PEP-NS had improved (quadratic; P < 0. 01) ADG and G:F, with the greatest improvement observed in pigs fed 6 % PEP-NS.

40|$|In the US {{prophylactic}} antibiotics {{are frequently}} {{included in the}} diets of weanling pigs to prevent postweaning diarrhea (PWD). Despite this, PWD still causes substantial losses to the swine industry through both mortalities and morbidly. Additionally, the use of prophylactic antibiotics has become a concern among some groups regarding their potential contribution to the spread and creation of antibiotic resistant bacteria. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if dietary inclusion of Colicin E 1 (ColE 1) altered a pigs behavior and postures when challenged with E. coli. Twenty-four newly weaned barrows; 21 days of age were placed into individual pens. Three dietary treatments were compared; treatment 1 had no ColE 1 (C; n= 8), treatment 2 added 1. 1 mg of purified ColE 1 (L; n= 8), and treatment 3 added 16. 5 mg (H; n= 8) of purified ColE 1. Two behaviors were collected; time spent at the <b>feeder</b> <b>trough</b> and drinking. Three postures were collected; active and inactive and other. There were no (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) effects on the time engaged in active, drinking and other. For pigs in the H group they engaged in more (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) eating and less time in inactive postures than C pigs. From this study, it can be concluded that pigs with the highest coverage of ColE 1 displayed less inactive behaviors and spent more time at the feeder indicating that ColE 1 may have offered some form of protection against the E. coli challenge and therefore improved the individual pig’s wellbeing...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} thesis {{reviews the}} idea of implementing a new container terminal in Falmouth. The original concept was bom the early seventies when the Falmouth Container Terminal limited proposed the British government to develop their facilities. The Falmouth container terminal would shorten the Transatlantic leg of deep sea container vessels. These faciUties would promote the transhipment option for the North European container trade. Within an environment of 10 major North European ports, the port of Falmouth would represent the opportunity of rationalising the existing route's pattern used by liner shipping companies. This rationalisation policy would promote the development of North European hubs distributing containers <b>trough,</b> a dense <b>feedering</b> network. This thesis took Falmouth as a basis to review the concept of port rationalisation in North Europe. A port survey allowed this work to define the situation and opinions of the 9 major European ports in North Europe. This gave the current state, of the investments in new container terminals in North Europe. This survey also provided figures related to the container handUng facilities supply. An analysis of the demand for such facilities from the liner companies allowed this thesis to review the North European shipping environment. Falmouth had proposed a fairly small terminal fitted with five post-panamax grantry cranes. This configuration asks the question {{whether or not a}} small and highly efficient terminal could comply with the requirements of a hub port. The example of comparable port faciUties shows the difficulty for small and isolated container terminals to compete with its environement of big ones. This thesis shows that a smaU and efficient terminal can not compete within an environment of bigger ones. Recently, the bigger port's investments improved their overall operating efficiency. This change is about to offset the marginal advantages by smaUer container handling faciUties. Finally, this study reviewed the role of geography and modal competition factors in the development of transhipment hubs. The port rationalisation in North Europe and the project of Falmouth container terminal have to comply with these factors...|$|R
