5|$|Beach Thomas {{was opposed}} {{to the use of}} the toothed steel trap <b>for</b> <b>catching</b> rabbits, {{supporting}} the RSPCA in its efforts to outlaw the device and noting that it both inflicted unnecessary pain and was indiscriminate in nature, sometimes trapping other animals such as domesticated cattle and pet dogs.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{potentially}} harmful effects on ecosystems, various {{efforts have been}} made to control introduced populations of C.maenas around the world. In Edgartown, Massachusetts, a bounty was levied in 1995 <b>for</b> <b>catching</b> C.maenas, to protect local shellfish, and 10tons were caught.|$|E

5|$|Recently, an {{analysis}} of nine different methods for preparing A. muscaria <b>for</b> <b>catching</b> flies in Slovenia {{have shown that the}} release of ibotenic acid and muscimol did not depend on the solvent (milk or water) and that thermal and mechanical processing led to faster extraction of ibotenic acid and muscimol.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{males are}} less ready to pursue and less {{efficient}} at catching than adult females, especially against larger prey. Males are quite effective against small web spiders, and reluctant to tackle large ones although they catch them in about 50% of attempts. Against other jumping spiders, males do not pursue large ones and pursue about 48% of small ones, catching 84% of those they pursue. Males of Portia do not build large webs <b>for</b> <b>catching</b> prey ("capture webs").|$|E

5|$|Cormorants are {{medium to}} large aquatic birds with mainly dark plumage {{and areas of}} {{coloured}} skin on the face. The bill is long, thin and sharply hooked <b>for</b> <b>catching</b> fish and aquatic invertebrates. They nest in colonies, usually by the sea. There are about 39 species worldwide, with two recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have been}} trapped since the 18th century. They have been popular with trappers {{due to the}} value of their fur, which has been used for scarves and neck pieces. The best pelts are from winter {{trapping}} with secondary quality pelts from spring trapping. The lowest-quality furs come from out-of-season trapping when fishers are moulting. They are easily trapped, and the value of their fur was a particular incentive <b>for</b> <b>catching</b> this species.|$|E
5|$|Having {{grown up}} in a hospital, Meredith shows immense natural talent. She {{possesses}} a steadfast, calm ease during medical procedures and emergencies, and is a natural observer of people. She exhibits a knack <b>for</b> <b>catching</b> subtle hints and accurately determining difficult-to-catch diagnoses. Her placid, non-judgmental bedside manner often causes people to open up and trust her. Her surgical skills are solidly impressive and she shows a talent and patience for medical research trials and dealing with psychologically damaged patients.|$|E

5|$|The Chinese {{incorporated}} Phoenix's brightest star, Ankaa (Alpha Phoenicis), {{and stars}} from the adjacent constellation Sculptor to depict Bakui, a net <b>for</b> <b>catching</b> birds. Phoenix and the neighbouring constellation of Grus together were seen by Julius Schiller as portraying Aaron the High Priest. These two constellations, along with nearby Pavo and Tucana, {{are called the}} Southern Birds.|$|E
5|$|After being remanded to {{determine}} if the regulations were not discriminatory, the case returned to the United States Supreme Court in Department of Game of Washington v. Puyallup Tribe (Puyallyp II). Again, Justice Douglas wrote the opinion for the Court, but this time he struck down the state restrictions as discriminatory. Douglas noted that the restrictions <b>for</b> <b>catching</b> steelhead trout with nets had remained, and was a method used only by the Indians, whereas hook and line fishing was allowed but was used only by non-Indians. As such, the effect of the regulation allocated all of the steelhead trout fishing to sport anglers, and none to the tribes.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{whales are}} not easy to catch or kill. Their speed and power meant that they were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead {{targeted}} sperm and right whales. In 1864, the Norwegian Svend Foyn equipped a steamboat with harpoons specifically designed <b>for</b> <b>catching</b> large whales. The harpoon gun was initially cumbersome and had a low success rate, but Foyn perfected it, and soon several whaling stations were established on the coast of Finnmark in northern Norway. Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.|$|E
50|$|A frisbee (also {{called a}} flying disc {{or simply a}} disc) is a gliding toy or {{sporting}} item that is generally plastic and roughly 20 to 25 cm in diameter with a lip, used recreationally and competitively <b>for</b> throwing and <b>catching,</b> <b>for</b> example, in flying disc games. The shape of the disc, an airfoil in cross-section, allows it to fly by generating lift as it moves through the air while spinning.|$|R

5|$|Mantises are {{an order}} (Mantodea) of insects that {{contains}} over 2,400 species in about 430 genera in 15 families. The largest {{family is the}} Mantidae ("mantids"). Mantises are distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats. They have triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks. Their elongated bodies {{may or may not}} have wings, but all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged and adapted <b>for</b> <b>catching</b> and gripping prey; their upright posture, while remaining stationary with forearms folded, has led to the common name praying mantis.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans are a genus {{of large}} water birds {{that makes up}} the family Pelecanidae. They are characterised by a long beak and a large throat pouch used <b>for</b> <b>catching</b> prey and {{draining}} water from the scooped up contents before swallowing. They have predominantly pale plumage, the exceptions being the brown and Peruvian pelicans. The bills, pouches and bare facial skin of all species become brightly coloured before the breeding season. The eight living pelican species have a patchy global distribution, ranging latitudinally from the tropics to the temperate zone, though they are absent from interior South America {{as well as from}} polar regions and the open ocean.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans {{are very}} large birds with very long bills characterised by a downcurved hook {{at the end}} of the upper mandible, and the {{attachment}} of a huge gular pouch to the lower. The slender rami of the lower bill and the flexible tongue muscles form the pouch into a basket <b>for</b> <b>catching</b> fish and, sometimes, rainwater, though in order not to hinder the swallowing of large fish, the tongue itself is tiny. They have a long neck and short stout legs with large, fully webbed feet. Although they are among the heaviest of flying birds, they are relatively light for their apparent bulk because of air pockets in the skeleton and beneath the skin enabling them to float high in the water. The tail is short and square. The wings are long and broad, suitably shaped for soaring and gliding flight, and have the unusually large number of 30 to 35 secondary flight feathers.|$|E

50|$|Anmado {{came to be}} {{an island}} because the Noryeong {{mountains}} of the west submerged. That is, {{it is a kind}} of islet but there are large mountains which are lower than sea surface. Transportation is quite inconvenient <b>for</b> even <b>catching</b> fish around another islet such as Nagwol-do or Songi-do.|$|R

5|$|Sidney Forrester Mashbir (12 September 1891– 13 June 1973) was {{a senior}} officer in the United States Army who was {{primarily}} involved in military intelligence. Born in New York, {{he served in the}} Arizona Army National Guard during the Mexican-American Border War. Mashbir then held several posts in intelligence positions, taking credit <b>for</b> <b>catching</b> the first German spy in the United States, before departing for on a four-year assignment as a language officer to Japan in 1920. He resigned from the army in 1923 in an attempt to execute his own master plan devised to extract intelligence from Japan in event of a war. His plan failed {{as a result of the}} Great Kantō earthquake in September 1923 and he was left bankrupt; he consequently returned to the US as an engineering businessman.|$|E
5|$|The {{proliferation}} of phumdis, coupled with severe infestation {{of the lake}} by water hyacinth, has substantially impeded water circulation and caused an increase in siltation and deposit of pollutants in the lake ecosystem. The building materials used to build huts on the phumdi blocks sunlight from reaching the lower depths of the lake water, which has resulted in formation of vertical profiles of the lake water body and decomposition. Further, pesticides and insecticides are used <b>for</b> <b>catching</b> fish or as insect repellent. Degradation {{is in the form}} of benthal, which, as it decays, releases toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and reduces dissolved oxygen (DO). This causes the lake water to degenerate into a eutrophic condition, creating a dead water zone called the hypolimnion. Above the hypolimnion is a thin layer, known as epilimnion, where fish survive to some degree. The benthal is becoming increasingly thick, causing not only pollution of the lake water, but an increase in the shallow part of the lake.|$|E
5|$|Tiktaalik {{generally}} had {{the characteristics}} of a lobe-finned fish, but with front fins featuring arm-like skeletal structures more akin to those of a crocodile, including a shoulder, elbow, and wrist. The fossil discovered in 2004 did not include the rear fins and tail. It had rows of sharp teeth indicative of a predator fish, and its neck could move independently of its body, which is not common in other fish (Tarrasius, Mandageria, placoderms, and extant seahorses being some exceptions; see also Lepidogalaxias and Channallabes apus). The animal had a flat skull resembling a crocodile's; eyes on top of its head, suggesting that it {{spent a lot of time}} looking up; a neck and ribs similar to those of tetrapods, with the ribs being used to support its body and aid in breathing via lungs; well developed jaws suitable <b>for</b> <b>catching</b> prey; and a small gill slit called a spiracle that, in more derived animals, became an ear.|$|E
