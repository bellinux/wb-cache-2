25|$|Alv Nepstad, who was {{chair of}} Rutelaget Askøy–Bergen, board {{member in the}} toll company and {{councilor}} for the Progress Party, made an alternative proposal. Banks would <b>issue</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> of NOK50 million towards the bridge, guaranteed {{in the real estate}} in the municipality. This would require that the owners of all 12,120 properties on the island agree to the agreement, and that a judicial registration for each of those properties be made to secure a guarantee for NOK4,125 each. Bjørkaas stated that the proposal did not involve any increased revenue for the bridge, and only would increase the company's debt. Sparebanken Vest characterized the idea as completely unrealistic and that the loan was planned taken up with a municipal and county guarantee anyway.|$|E

50|$|The most simple {{interest}} rate control puts an upper limit on any loans from formal institutions. This might simply {{say that no}} financial institution may <b>issue</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> at a rate greater than, say, 40% interest per annum, or 3% per month.|$|E

5000|$|In finance, [...] "participation" [...] is an {{ownership}} {{interest in a}} mortgage or other loan. In particular, loan participation is a cooperation of multiple lenders to <b>issue</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> (known as participation loan) to one borrower. This is usually done {{in order to reduce}} individual risks of the lenders.|$|E
5000|$|Lenders {{typically}} require {{access to}} the borrower's credit report before issuing a loan in the borrower's name. If lenders cannot see the borrower's credit report, it is unlikely the lender will <b>issue</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> in the borrower's name. Hence, credit freezing should reduce the risk that loans or credit cards will be issued fraudulently. Credit freezes do have some disadvantages, however, such as creating potential difficulties or delays applying for a loan.|$|E
50|$|Mortgage brokers {{can obtain}} loan {{approvals}} from the largest secondary wholesale market lenders in the country. For example, Fannie Mae may <b>issue</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> approval to a client through its mortgage broker, which {{can then be}} assigned to any {{of a number of}} mortgage bankers on the approved list. The broker will often compare rates for that day. The broker will then assign the loan to a designated licensed lender based on their pricing and closing speed. The lender may close the loan and service the loan. They may either fund it permanently or temporarily with a warehouse line of credit prior to selling it into a larger lending pool.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{assume a}} {{particular}} U.S. depository institution, {{in the normal}} course of business, <b>issues</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan.</b> This dispenses money and decreases the ratio of bank reserves to money loaned. If its reserve ratio drops below the legally required minimum, it must add to its reserves to remain compliant with Federal Reserve regulations. The bank can borrow the requisite funds from another bank that has a surplus in its account with the Fed. The interest rate that the borrowing bank pays to the lending bank to borrow the funds is negotiated between the two banks, and the weighted average of this rate across all such transactions is the federal funds effective rate.|$|R

The proposal was supported by the Labour Party and Centre Party, who had 28 of 49 councilors, but opposed {{by the rest of the}} council. Along with two banks, {{the municipal}}ity established a limited company which would own the venue. The municipality and banks would pay for the club's debt of NOK5.4 million, and take over the stadium's operating costs of roughly NOK1 million per year. Ham-Kam would have to pay rent on the stadium. The transaction took place on 26 January 1994, and included a clause granting Ham-Kam the right to buy back the stadium at a later date.

25|$|As {{result of}} the alliance, Colombia was able to {{modernize}} both its military and society at large. In addition to the naval and aviation missions established {{in the early years}} of the war, Colombia later participated in the Lend-Lease program. On March 17, 1942, Colombia and the United States signed an agreement that granted the former $16.5million in military assistance. The terms of the agreement were most favorable, because Colombia was able to purchase military equipment at half the regular cost, and also did not have to pay interest on its purchases. Other favorable loans and grants soon followed. For example, the Export-Import Bank provided $20million for highway construction, $10.3million for agricultural programs, and another $3.5million to build a hydroelectric plant. It also <b>issued</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> for low-cost housing construction. In addition, American private investment soared to more that $200million by 1943.|$|R

Because of a reduction in maize production by about 12%, intervention on behalf of the IMF was necessary to prevent maize inflation. The United Nations World Food Program has estimated a reduction in the production of maize as well as other crops, that has left over 6.5 million Malawians susceptible to food insecurity. The Executive Board of the IMF approved this additional disbursement in order to alleviate the severe food shortage in Malawi.|$|R

After being <b>issued</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> from SAS the following year, Widerøe was able increase its fleet of Otters for four and could retire the Ju-52. The company changed its name back to Widerøe's Flyveselskap A/S on 1 July 1958 and took over SAS' aviation school at Fornebu. That year both a Cessna 170 and a Cornell crashed, between them killing five people. The company bought a Douglas RB-26C Invader, which they used for aerial photography in Svalbard. The air force retired its last nine Norsemen in 1959, and Widerøe cooperated with Solbergfly to purchase these, paying NOK 125,000 for five aircraft. This proved too ambitious, so they sold two to Aero Sahara. SAS decided to reduce its routes in Finnmark in 1960, resulting in Widerøe retiring their Norsemen, leaving the airline exclusively with Otters for scheduled services.|$|R
