The Hayes forward attempted to free the rope but fell and landed on a large spike: the spike went up through one of his buttocks, through his stomach and narrowly avoided a lung. Not only was Friday strong enough to pull himself off the spike, he recovered from his injuries within three months and returned to the Hayes team in October 1972.|$|E
25|$|Drag-line {{excavation}} {{systems are}} heavy equipment used in civil engineering and surface mining. In civil engineering the smaller types {{are used for}} road and port construction. The larger types are used in strip-mining operations to move overburden above coal, and for tar-sand mining. A drag line bucket system consists of a large bucket which is suspended from a boom, a large truss-like structure, with wire ropes. The bucket is maneuvered {{by means of a}} number of ropes and chains. The <b>hoist</b> <b>rope,</b> powered by large diesel or electric motors, supports the bucket and hoist-coupler assembly from the boom. The drag rope is used to draw the bucket assembly horizontally. By skillful maneuvre of the hoist and the drag ropes the bucket is controlled for various operations. The dragline excavator was invented in 1904 by John W. Page.|$|E

Li (2010) established Horizontal and vertical vibration models of the hoisting container under the steel guide and the vibration characteristic of hoisting container under different faults of steel guide was studied. To master the impact dynamical behaviors of the <b>hoisting</b> <b>rope</b> during the skip loading, the mechanical model of the coupled longitudinal-torsional vibration for <b>hoisting</b> <b>rope</b> were built by Cao (2010).|$|R

50|$|In {{a typical}} cycle of excavation, the bucket is {{positioned}} above {{the material to}} be excavated. The bucket is then lowered and the dragrope is then drawn so that the bucket is dragged along {{the surface of the}} material. The bucket is then lifted by using the <b>hoist</b> <b>rope.</b> A swing operation is then performed to move the bucket to the place where the material is to be dumped. The dragrope is then released causing the bucket to tilt and empty. This is called a dump operation.|$|E

50|$|A crane {{is a type}} of machine, {{generally}} {{equipped with}} a <b>hoist</b> <b>rope,</b> wire ropes or chains, and sheaves, that can be used both to lift and lower materials and to move them horizontally. It is mainly used for lifting heavy things and transporting them to other places. The device uses one or more simple machines to create mechanical advantage and thus move loads beyond the normal capability of a human. Cranes are commonly employed in the transport industry for the loading and unloading of freight, in the construction industry for the movement of materials, and in the manufacturing industry for the assembling of heavy equipment.|$|E

50|$|UDD {{stands for}} Universal-Dig-Dump. It {{represents}} the first fundamental change to draglines {{for almost a}} century, since {{the invention of the}} 'miracle hitch'. Instead of using two ropes (the <b>hoist</b> <b>rope</b> and the drag rope) to manipulate the bucket, a UDD machine uses three ropes, two hoist and one drag. This allows the dragline operator to have much greater selectivity in when to pick up the bucket, and in how the bucket may be dumped. UDD machines generally have higher productivity than a standard dragline, but often have greater mechanical issues. Within the mining industry, there is still much debate as to whether UDD improvements justify their costs.|$|E

5000|$|Beside {{the open}} ground floor within the arches {{there are two}} more floors to the mill, the first, lower, or stone floor 15 ft above ground level, housing millstones, great spur wheel, hurst frame, sack <b>hoist</b> <b>rope</b> passing through the floor trap, and the upper, second, or hoist floor with brake wheel, main gearing (wallover), sack hoist pulley, {{and parts of the}} winding winch. The windshaft and the main parts of the winding system {{including}} the wind direction indicator is installed within the cap. The space inside the arches, until 1930, used to have a wooden structure to store the grain, and an open timber staircase to reach the milling floors. This structure was removed to prevent vandalism. The cap of the mill is a shallow dome which used to be covered with lead sheet, but also because of vandalism is now covered with aluminium. Between the cap and the top of the wall is a system of rollers running in a track plate allowing the cap to be rotated easily. There is a wind direction indicator on the roof which is continued into the interior, and a small repeat indicator at its lower end, so that the miller could set the mill without leaving his work. The lattice-type-sails are 60 ft span counter clock-wise rotation (seen from outside the mill; most of all windmills worldwide rotate clockwise seen from inside the mill - from [...] "under the wind") and with 450 sq ft of canvas. The arched tower covers a very small diameter of 22 ft and it has an unusual [...] "in cap" [...] winding gear for an English windmill, the cap being winded by a hand operated winch having spur and worm gears.|$|E

40|$|This study {{reviews the}} {{requirements}} for an effective reliable inspection and discard policy based on monitoring the condition of ropes used in Indian mines. This contrasts with current practice which is based upon a policy of 'Statutory Life Policy'. Data have been collected data on rope service to study the influence of operating parameters on the degradation mechanisms affecting <b>hoisting</b> <b>ropes</b> in Indian mines. In addition to this, records on failed/premature discarded <b>hoisting</b> <b>ropes</b> from Indian mines have been also collected to classify the prominent causes of failure in terms of operating parameters. These data include 645 records of ropes (606 from 303 drum winders and 39 from 11 friction winders) which have been In service, and 45 records of failure and premature discard categorized in terms of different parameters.

40|$|Measurements of the {{absolute}} value of electromagnetic noise and attenuation along a <b>hoist</b> <b>rope</b> were made in an operating hard-rock mine, Lucky Friday Mine, located near Wallace, Idaho. Spectra of electromagnetic noise generated by various pieces of equipment, spectra of specific noise signals at various depths, and noise and attenuation on the 4250 foot (1295 meter) hoist, were measured. Three techniques were {{used to make the}} measurements. First, noise was measured over the en- tire electromagnetic spectrum of interest for brief time periods. Data were recorded using broadband analog magnetic tape for later transformation to spectral plots. Second, noise amplitudes were recorded at several discrete frequencies for a sufficient amount of time to provide data for amplitude probability distributions. A third technique gave attenuation data through the direct measurement of field strength at various depths. The specific measured results are given in a number of spectral plots, amplitude probability distribution plots and amplitude curves as a function of depth...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND A mine shaft is the {{lifeline}} to underground mines. Mine operators {{depend on}} safe, uninterrupted, and efficient {{movement of workers}} and materials. The shaft and hoisting system provides access to the network of openings used to recover the underground resource, provides vertical transport of miners and materials, and serves as an escapeway {{in case of an}} emergency. Accidents involving hoisting can be catastrophic. Such was the case in 1973 at the Markham Colliery in Derbyshire, UK when the conveyance overwound and fell to the shaft bottom, resulting in 17 deaths. Hoist and elevator machinery must meet the requirements specified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 57 and 75. According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) data, many shaft-related accidents in the United States are associated with the hoisting cycle. MSHA statistics show that there were about 1500 shaft- related accidents in the 5 -year period between 1992 - 1996. Most of these accidents resulted from the action, motion, or failure of the hoisting equipment or mechanism and involved movement of the conveyance which includes cages, skips, ore buckets, and elevators. A hoisting hazard may be characterized as an "unsafe hoist operating condition caused by insufficient or inaccurate information available to the hoist operator" (authors' quote). Earlier investigators have defined safety features and operating and maintenance standards for hoists, and reported on monitoring and control systems and sensors for hoists and conveyances [Farley, 1983; Ward, 19931. However, despite the considerable technological progress and hoisting control improvements in recent years, safety- related issues that require further investigation still remain. The hoist operator must constantly be aware of two important hoist-operating conditions: the position of the conveyance and the tension in the <b>hoist</b> <b>rope.</b> If this information is not available or is inaccurate, the hoist becomes unsafe. Current technology provides this information indirectly from sensors and indicators in the hoist room. However, unlike a building elevator hoistway, mine shaft hoistway problems often include: 1. poor ground conditions and excessive shaft wall and guide displacement; 2. rock bursts in deep mines (resulting in large rock movements and fragments blocking the hoist way); 3. water, ice, and salt buildup (impeding the smooth flow of the conveyance); 4. severe vibration from hoisting (resulting in loose guide support brackets, broken welds, or other alignment and conveyance mechanism malfunctions). The second issue relates to dynamic rope loads applied during normal winding, particularly during loading, acceleration, and stopping. Safety factors on wire rope are based on static load. They are artificially high to account for all cases of dynamic loads, even though the total load history on the rope (static and dynamic) during service is unknown. Therefore the tension, and thus the compliance with wire rope load safety factors, is unknown to the hoistman...|$|E

5000|$|In mines where {{grades were}} not uniform {{or where the}} grades were not steep enough for gravity to pull a train into the mine, the main <b>hoisting</b> <b>rope</b> could be {{augmented}} with a tail rope connected to {{the opposite end of}} the train of mine cars. The tail-rope system had its origins on cable-hauled surface inclines prior to the 1830s. [...] This was the dominant system in the 1880s [...] Frequently, one engine was used to work both ropes, with the tail rope reaching into the mine, around a pulley at the far end, and then out again.|$|R
5000|$|Friction (or Koepe) hoists are {{the most}} common type of hoist used in Europe, Asia and Australia. [...] The {{friction}} hoist was invented in 1877 by Frederick Koepe. [...] Friction hoists are mounted on the ground above the mine shaft, or at the top of the headframe. Friction <b>hoists</b> utilize tail <b>ropes</b> and counterweights and do not have the haulage rope fixed to the wheel, but instead passed around it. The tailropes and weights offset the need for the motor to overcome the weight of the conveyance and <b>hoisting</b> <b>rope,</b> thereby reducing the required horsepower of the hoisting motor by up to 30%, with the overall power consumption remaining the same. Friction hoists, unlike drum hoists, can and normally do use multiple ropes giving them a larger payload capacity, however since they require a larger safety factor, they are impractical for very deep shafts.|$|R

5000|$|Drum hoists are {{the most}} common type of hoist used in North America, South Africa and South America. When using a drum hoist the {{hoisting}} cable is wound around the drum when the conveyance is lifted. Single-drum hoists can be used in smaller applications, however double-drum hoists easily allow the hoisting of two conveyances in balance (i.e. one skip being lifted while a second skip is being lowered). [...] Drum hoists are mounted on concrete slabs within a hoistroom, the <b>hoisting</b> <b>ropes</b> run from the drum, up to the top of the headframe, over a sheave wheel and down where they connect to the conveyance (cage or skip).|$|R
40|$|Lifting {{operation}} on a FPSO (Floating Production, Storage and Offloading vessel) {{is much more}} demanding for the crane and the crane driver than similar operations on a fixed offshore platform. Due to {{the motion of the}} FPSO in heavy sea and strong wind, the crane is subjected to additional dynamic forces as well as swinging loads. The present paper deals with numerical simulation of the dynamic behaviour of the Norne offshore crane during lifting operation. The simulations are performed by FEDEM – a general nonlinear dynamic analysis program for flexible multibody systems. The pedestal, “king ” and boom are flexible links modelled by shell finite elements and connected together by different joints. The <b>hoisting</b> <b>rope</b> and the hydraulic cylinders are modelled by linear and nonlinear spring and damper elements. A control system is implemented in the model making it possible to control the movement of the boom and the winch to compensate for the relative motion between the ship and the supply vessel and keep the load in rest relative to the vessel. Examples are shown of calculated natural frequencies and mode shapes as function of <b>hoisting</b> <b>rope</b> length and boom angle. Furthermore, maximum dynamic stresses in different sections/details are presented as function of how the crane is operated. Besides giving necessary stress data for design verification against overload and fatigue, the presented model can be used to optimise the operation procedure, determine the maximum allowable load for various sea states and to calculate necessary power to control the motion of the load...|$|R
