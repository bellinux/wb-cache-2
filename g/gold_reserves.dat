5|$|Between 1999 and 2002 Brown sold 60% of the UK's <b>gold</b> <b>reserves</b> {{shortly before}} gold entered a {{protracted}} bull market, since nicknamed by dealers as Brown Bottom. The official reason for selling the <b>gold</b> <b>reserves</b> was {{to reduce the}} portfolio risk of the UK's reserves by diversifying away from gold. The UK eventually sold about 395 tons of gold over 17 auctions from July 1999 to March 2002, at an average price of about US$275 per ounce, raising approximately US$3.5billion. By 2011, that quantity of gold would be worth over $19 billion, leading to Brown's decision to sell the gold being widely criticised.|$|E
5|$|During the interwar period, Belgium {{had created}} a gold-based currency, called the Belga, which ran {{parallel}} to the Belgian franc. The Belga was intended for international trading and meant that the National Bank of Belgium amassed considerable <b>gold</b> <b>reserves,</b> amounting to some 600 tonnes by 1940.|$|E

After the election, he attended {{a meeting of the}} American Bimetallic League, a pro-silver group, and gave speeches advocating an inflationist monetary policy. In the meantime, the Panic of 1893 caused bank failures, factory closures, and general economic upheaval. As the federal <b>gold</b> <b>reserves</b> dwindled, President Cleveland convinced Congress to repeal the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which ensured the government would purchase less silver for coining and which further disconcerted free silver supporters. While depletion of <b>gold</b> <b>reserves</b> slowed after the repeal, the country's economy still floundered.|$|E

5|$|During {{the meeting}} in Kolwezi, Tshombe had ordered all {{remaining}} Katangese armed forces to withdraw to Portuguese Angola. Jean Schramme was appointed to be commander of an army in exile, while Jeremiah Puren was ordered to evacuate {{what remained of the}} Katangese Air Force, along with necessary military equipment and the Katangese treasury. This was accomplished via air and railway. Rhodesian operatives assisted in smuggling the <b>gold</b> <b>reserves</b> out of the country. The last of Schramme's mercenaries and gendarmes were evacuated on 25 January. Other gendarmes spent the remainder of 1963 in Northern Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|Payne {{drew up a}} {{compromise}} bill, in which the Resumption Act would be repealed and replaced with a gradual, partial return to gold-backed money. Under the Payne Act, national banks {{would be required to}} build up <b>gold</b> <b>reserves</b> equal to three percent of the value of greenbacks in circulation that year, adding an additional three percent each year until 1885, when they would have <b>gold</b> <b>reserves</b> of thirty percent of the value of circulating greenbacks. At that point, greenbacks would become redeemable in at least thirty percent gold. This compromise was still too much for the Eastern Democrats and Republicans who favored the gold standard, and the Banking Committee refused to approve the bill. Payne contrived to bypass his committee and bring the bill for a vote by the whole House, but it was voted down, 81 to 157. The House later passed a complete repeal of the Resumption Act, 133 to 120, but the Senate declined to take up the matter. Specie resumption remained {{the law of the land}} when the 44th Congress's term expired.|$|E
5|$|Tax {{revenue from}} the Belgian Congo enabled the Belgian {{government}} in exile and Free Belgian Forces to fund themselves, unlike most other states in exile, which operated through subsidies and donations from sympathetic governments.

5|$|The Ju 87s also {{assisted}} German {{forces in}} the Battle of the Netherlands. The Dutch Navy {{in concert with the}} British were evacuating the Dutch Royal Family and Dutch <b>Gold</b> <b>reserves</b> through the country's ports. Ju 87s sank the Dutch Jan Van Galen (1,316 tons) and Johan Maurtis Van Nassau (1,520 tons) as they provided close-shore artillery support at Waalhaven and the Afsluitdijk. The British Valentine was crippled, beached and scuttled while Winchester, Whitley and Westminster were damaged. Whitley was later beached and scuttled after an air attack on 19 May.|$|E
5|$|The {{considerable}} Belgian <b>gold</b> <b>reserves,</b> {{on which}} the Belga had been secured, were mostly transported to Britain, Canada and the United States before the German invasion. Over 198 tonnes, however, had been entrusted to the Banque de France before the war, and shipped to Dakar in French West Africa. Under the pro-German Vichy régime, the gold was seized by the Germans, who used it to buy munitions from neutral Switzerland and Sweden.|$|E

In November 1916, Germany had inquired to find out if Austria-Hungary were interested in purchasing existing German submarines because Germany was having a hard time finding trained submarine crews. After protracted negotiations, which had stalled over the outflow of Austro-Hungarian <b>gold</b> <b>reserves</b> to Germany, an agreement to purchase two submarines—UB-43 and UB-47—was reached in June 1917.|$|E

5|$|Goldfinger is {{the seventh}} novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series, first {{published}} in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 23 March 1959. Goldfinger originally bore the title The Richest Man in the World and was written in January and February 1958. The story centres on the investigation by MI6 operative James Bond into the gold smuggling activities of Auric Goldfinger, who is also suspected by MI6 of being connected to SMERSH, the Soviet counter-intelligence organisation. As well as establishing the background to the smuggling operation, Bond uncovers a much larger plot, with Goldfinger planning to steal the <b>gold</b> <b>reserves</b> of the United States from Fort Knox.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} governments in exile, which {{were forced to}} rely {{exclusively}} on financial support from the Allies, the Belgian government in exile could fund itself independently. In large part, {{this was due to}} the fact that the government in exile retained control of most of the Belgian national <b>gold</b> <b>reserves.</b> These had been moved secretly to Britain in May 1940 aboard the naval trawler A4, and provided an important asset. The Belgian government was also in control of the Belgian Congo, which exported large amounts of raw materials (including rubber, gold and uranium) which the Allies relied on for the war effort.|$|E
5|$|Geneforges {{dialogue}} is delivered through on-screen text. Encounters with intelligent creations or humans {{result in the}} player being given a series of pre-determined questions or responses. Conversation options and the outcome of those conversations change according to the player's previous interactions. as well as which quests have been completed; which items the player has; which group the player belongs to and the player's leadership skill. The player can collect items from defeated enemies and the game environments to improve their own equipment. Non-player characters can trade with the player, buying most items regardless of type. The shopkeeper has a fixed amount of gold {{at the start of}} the game which does not replenish itself. It is possible for the player to drain all shopkeepers of their <b>gold</b> <b>reserves,</b> making it impossible to sell further items.|$|E

5|$|IMF members {{signed the}} Jamaica Agreement in January 1976, which {{ratified}} {{the end of}} the Bretton Woods system and reoriented the Fund's role in supporting the international monetary system. The agreement officially embraced the flexible exchange rate regimes that emerged after the failure of the Smithsonian Agreement measures. In tandem with floating exchange rates, the agreement endorsed central bank interventions aimed at clearing excessive volatility. The agreement retroactively formalized the abandonment of gold as a reserve instrument and the Fund subsequently demonetized its <b>gold</b> <b>reserves,</b> returning gold to members or selling it to provide poorer nations with relief funding. Developing countries and countries not endowed with oil export resources enjoyed greater access to IMF lending programs as a result. The Fund continued assisting nations experiencing balance of payments deficits and currency crises, but began imposing conditionality on its funding that required countries to adopt policies aimed at reducing deficits through spending cuts and tax increases, reducing protective trade barriers, and contractionary monetary policy.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} {{gold standard}} {{was established in}} 1821 by the United Kingdom as the Bank of England enabled redemption of its banknotes for gold bullion. France, Germany, the United States, Russia, and Japan each embraced the standard one by one from 1878 to 1897, marking its international acceptance. The first departure from the standard occurred in August 1914 when these nations erected trade embargoes on gold exports and suspended redemption of gold for banknotes. Following the end of World War I on November 11, 1918, Austria, Hungary, Germany, Russia, and Poland began experiencing hyperinflation. Having informally departed from the standard, most currencies were freed from exchange rate fixing and allowed to float. Most countries throughout this period sought to gain national advantages and bolster exports by depreciating their currency values to predatory levels. A number of countries, including the United States, made unenthusiastic and uncoordinated attempts to restore the former gold standard. The {{early years of the}} Great Depression brought about bank runs in the United States, Austria, and Germany, which placed pressures on <b>gold</b> <b>reserves</b> in the United Kingdom {{to such a degree that}} the gold standard became unsustainable. Germany became the first nation to formally abandon the post-World War I gold standard when the Dresdner Bank implemented foreign exchange controls and announced bankruptcy on July 15, 1931. In September 1931, the United Kingdom allowed the pound sterling to float freely. By the end of 1931, a host of countries including Austria, Canada, Japan, and Sweden abandoned gold. Following widespread bank failures and a hemorrhaging of <b>gold</b> <b>reserves,</b> the United States broke free of the gold standard in April 1933. France would not follow suit until 1936 as investors fled from the franc due to political concerns over Prime Minister Léon Blum's government.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, the Sherman Silver Purchase Act greatly {{increased}} government purchases of silver. The government pledged {{to stand behind}} the silver dollars and treasury notes issued under the act by redeeming them in gold. Pursuant to this promise, government <b>gold</b> <b>reserves</b> dwindled over the following three years. Although the economic Panic of 1893 {{had a number of}} causes, President Grover Cleveland believed the inflation caused by Sherman's act to be a major factor, and called a special session of Congress to repeal it. Congress did so, but the debates showed bitter divides in both major parties between silver and gold factions. Cleveland tried to replenish the Treasury through issuance of bonds which could only be purchased with gold, with little effect but to increase the public debt, as the gold continued to be withdrawn in redemption for paper and silver currency. Many in the public saw the bonds as benefiting bankers, not the nation. The bankers' feeling was that they did not want loans repaid in an inflated currency—the gold standard was deflationary, and as creditors, they preferred to be paid in such a currency, whereas debtors preferred to repay in inflated currency.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, one of Independence Hall's {{exterior}} doors {{was replaced by}} glass, allowing some view of the bell even when the building was closed. When Congress enacted the nation's first peacetime draft in 1940, the first Philadelphians required to serve took their oaths of enlistment before the Liberty Bell. Once the war started, the bell was again a symbol, used to sell war bonds. In {{the early days of}} World War II, it was feared that the bell might be in danger from saboteurs or enemy bombing, and city officials considered moving the bell to Fort Knox, to be stored with the nation's <b>gold</b> <b>reserves.</b> The idea provoked a storm of protest from around the nation, and was abandoned. Officials then considered building an underground steel vault above which it would be displayed, and into which it could be lowered if necessary. The project was dropped when studies found that the digging might undermine the foundations of Independence Hall. The bell was again tapped on D-Day, as well as in victory on V-E Day and V-J Day.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, the MacDonald Government faced {{a serious}} crisis, as the May Report {{revealed}} that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of £120million. As this information became public, there was a run on the pound, depleting the nation's <b>gold</b> <b>reserves.</b> The Labour Party refused to consider the massive cuts in unemployment compensation which {{would be needed to}} balance the budget, and Prime Minister MacDonald sought support from outside his party. With Baldwin on holiday in France, Chamberlain negotiated for the Conservatives. Chamberlain told MacDonald that the Conservatives would only join a coalition if the full recommended cuts in unemployment compensation were made. Finally, on 24 August 1931, the Labour Government resigned and MacDonald formed a National Government, supported by most Conservative and Liberal MPs and a minority of the Labour Party. Chamberlain once more returned to the Ministry of Health. The National Government was intended as only a temporary expedient, but governed Britain until Chamberlain's fall in 1940. In the ensuing General Election, the National Government won 554 of the 615seats in the House of Commons, with 473 of its supporters Conservative MPs.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Cleveland's {{second term}} began, the Panic of 1893 struck the stock market, and he soon faced an acute {{economic}} depression. The panic was worsened by the acute shortage of gold {{that resulted from}} the increased coinage of silver, and Cleveland called Congress into special session {{to deal with the}} problem. The debate over the coinage was as heated as ever, and the effects of the panic had driven more moderates to support repealing the coinage provisions of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Even so, the silverites rallied their following at a convention in Chicago, and the House of Representatives debated for fifteen weeks before passing the repeal by a considerable margin. In the Senate, the repeal of silver coinage was equally contentious. Cleveland, forced against his better judgment to lobby the Congress for repeal, convinced enough Democrats – and along with eastern Republicans, they formed a 48–37 majority for repeal. Depletion of the Treasury's <b>gold</b> <b>reserves</b> continued, at a lesser rate, and subsequent bond issues replenished supplies of gold. At the time the repeal seemed a minor setback to silverites, but it {{marked the beginning of the}} end of silver as a basis for American currency.|$|E

After the {{passage of the}} <b>Gold</b> <b>Reserve</b> Act several people were indicted for violating the clauses that restricted gold ownership and trade. Frederick Barber Campbell (who was actually convicted under the <b>Gold</b> <b>Reserve</b> Act's predecessor, Executive Order 6102), was convicted of hoarding gold when he tried to withdraw 5,000 troy ounces of gold he had at Chase National bank. Gus Farber, a diamond and jewelry merchant was arrested with his father and 12 others for illegally selling $20 gold coins without a license. The Baraban family was arrested for operating a gold scrap business under a false license. Foreign companies even had their gold confiscated. The Uebersee Finanz-Korporation, a Swiss banking company, had $1,250,000 in gold coins that were being held in the United States.|$|R
