40|$|Digestion of {{hydrolysed}} and non-hydrolysed dairy (casein and whey proteins) and soy proteins {{commonly used}} in infant formulations was studied under an in vitro gastrointestinal (without lipases) conditions for 60 and 120 minutes in the stomach and small intestine respectively. pH-drop, gel electrophoresis, microstructure, particle size distribution, and ninhydrin-reactive amino nitrogen of the digesta were monitored over the digestion period. Obtained results suggested <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>proteins</b> completely digested in the small intestine while non-hydrolysed proteins (caseins, α-lactalbumin, β–lactoglobulin, conglycinin, glycinin) only partially digested in the simulated gastrointestinal tract. Although observed pH-drop for non-hydrolysed protein formulations was lower, {{significantly higher levels of}} ninhydrin-reactive amino nitrogen in <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>proteins</b> suggested higher digestibility of <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>proteins</b> than their non-hydrolysed counterparts.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several studies {{investigated}} whether <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>proteins</b> can induce {{tolerance to}} cow's milk (CM) in {{children at risk}} of developing CM allergy. Due to methodological problems and inconsistent findings, the evidence for a tolerogenic effect is limited. A major problem is that different hydrolysates may give different outcomes due to variations in their production and composition. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the effect of the degree of hydrolysis on the allergenicity and immunogenicity of whey hydrolysates. METHODS: The hydrolysis of whey was stopped at different time-points between 1 and 60 min. In 18 CM allergic patients, the allergenicity of the hydrolysates was determined by immunoblot and the basophil activation test. To test immunogenicity, CM-specific T cell lines were generated. RESULTS: In most patients, increasing time of hydrolysis decreased IgE recognition and basophil activation. However, in five patients, <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>proteins</b> induced more basophil activation than non-hydrolysed proteins. The immunoblot data indicated that these patients recognized either a 25 - to 30 -kDa degradation product of casein or a 10 -kDa degradation product of whey. Although T cell activation was decreased in all patients over time, half of them still showed a positive response to the proteins after 60 min of hydrolysis. CONCLUSION: Increasing the time of hydrolysis reduces both allergenicity and immunogenicity of whey hydrolysates in most but not all patients. This indicates that not the degree of hydrolysis is decisive but the presence and stability of IgE and T cell epitopes in the hydrolysate recognized by individual patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} tract of marine fish larvae undergoes extensive changes during the larval stage. The success in weaning increases as the juvenile stage approaches and the {{gastrointestinal tract}} attains a more adult-like form and functionality. In the present study, intestinal maturation in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippolgossus) larvae was compared with weaning studies {{to give an}} indication whether intestinal maturation and weaning success were correlated. Activities of the brush border membrane (bbm) enzymes alkaline phosphatase (AP) and leucine aminopeptidase N (LAP) were used as markers for for intestinal maturation. In addition, the activity of intestinal leucylalanine peptidase (Leu-ala) {{was used as a}} marker for larval mode of digestion, but this marker gave no information in decline in larval digestive features in cod and halibut. The specific activities of AP and LAP increased abruptly from 30 to 40 - 50 dpff in both species, corresponding to 50 - 120 mg wet weight in halibut and 7 - 9 mm standard length (SL) in cod. These increases mark the time when the intestine achieves a more adult-like functionality, and thus, the fish larvae were considered to be better prepared to digest microparticulate diets. Comparison of intestinal maturation with early weaning studies with cod and halibut indicated that intestinal maturation was important for succeeding in weaning of these two species. However, several factors are supposed to influence the weaning results, and in particular the suitability of the diet. Marine fish larvae absorb <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein</b> more efficiently than intact protein. Thus, including part of the dietary <b>protein</b> in a <b>hydrolysed</b> form is thought to enhance growth and development during the larval stage when the gastrointestinal tract is not fully mature. Graded levels of pepsin <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein</b> (from 0 to 40 - 45 %) were included in the weaning diets for cod (11 mg wet weight) and halibut (120 and 220 mg wet weight) in order to define the optimal level of <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein.</b> Cod obtained the highest survival rate when 40 % of the dietary protein was exchanged with pepsin <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein.</b> Higher inclusion levels were not tested. In contrast, the diets added none or 10 % pepsin <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein</b> supported the highest survival rates in halibut. Specific activities of AP and LAP showed positive correlation with the survival results, supporting that cod and halibut took benefit of high and low levels of dietary <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein,</b> respectively. Dietary <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein</b> did not affect growth significantly. The main reason for the different results obtained with cod and halibut {{is considered to be a}} combination of different feeding practise in cod and halibut, and high leaching rates of <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein</b> from microparticulate diets. Determination of leaching rates from three microparticulate diets showed that nutrient losses were extensive, but to some extent dependent on type of feed, feed particle size and molecular size of the dietary peptides (i. e. amino acids>hydrolysed protein>intact protein). Halibut ingests diet particles slowly, allowing extensive losses of nutrients from the diet prior to ingestion. Cod ingests diet particles rapidly, and thus when the particles still contain some <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein.</b> The protein content in the diets offered to halibut was probably reduced comparatively with <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein</b> inclusion level, and since juvenile halibut is considered to have a high dietary protein requirement, a sub-optimal level of protein may have been reached when the diets contained high levels of <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein.</b> This may explain the low optimal level of dietary <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>protein</b> to halibut...|$|R

Sediment samples were collected in the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (PAP, 4800 m depth) during 6 oceanographic cruises from September 1996 to October 1998 down {{to a depth of}} 15 cm. Sedimentary proteins, carbohydrates and lipids, and their enzymatically hydrolysable fractions showed significant temporal changes, but different biochemical classes displayed different temporal patterns.

40|$|Protein hydrolysates are {{commonly}} used in high-tolerance or hypoallergenic formulae. The relation between the physicochemical properties of <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>proteins</b> (i. e., size, molecular weight distribution, charge, hydrophobicity), and their emulsifying properties is not fully understood. In this work, the emulsion forming ability (i. e., the equilibrium between droplet formation and coalescence during emulsification), the gravitational stability, the adsorption kinetics and the interfacial dilatational rheology of whey proteins and whey protein hydrolysates were investigated. More extensive hydrolysis resulted in a progressive decrease of the surface hydrophobicity of the emulsifiers (i. e., whey protein or whey protein hydrolysates). Whey protein was able to form smaller emulsion droplets at low concentrations ( 2 wt%), similar minimum droplet sizes were obtained due to the adsorption of large peptides. Whey protein-stabilised interfaces showed the lowest interfacial tension and ζ-potential, which both increased with increasing degree of hydrolysis. Whey protein produced stronger oil-water interfacial layers (i. e., high dilatational moduli and non-linear behavior) and had higher protein surface coverage compared to WPH. Small whey protein peptides ( 5 kDa) were preferentially adsorbed over small peptides.

Hydrolysed or non-hydrolysed whey protein/lactose (WP/L) dispersions were spray dried, in order {{to examine the effects of}} protein hydrolysis on relaxation behaviour and stickiness of model powders. Whey proteins included a non-hydrolysed, whey protein isolate control and three hydrolysed whey protein powders (WPH), with DH values of 8, 11 and 32, where DH = degree of hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of whey proteins increased moisture sorption in WP/L powders. Moisture sorption was higher in powders containing <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>proteins.</b> Whey proteins delayed the time-dependent onset of lactose crystallization, and this effect was greatest in powders containing WPH 32. Glass-rubber transition (T gr) temperatures of WP/L powders were not affected by protein hydrolysis but were dominated by the lactose fraction. Powders containing hydrolysed whey proteins were more susceptible to sticking compared to intact proteins. Surface coverage by proteins or peptides was lower in powders containing hydrolysed WP, and this would have contributed to the greater susceptibility of these powders to sticking. Results suggest that hydrolysis of WP affected the relaxation behaviour of WP/L powders and altered the rate at which lactose underwent viscous flow behaviour...|$|E

Sixteen patients entered remission (including withdrawal of corticosteroids), six patients could not tolerate the nasogastric tube, and 22 patients failed to respond.

It was hypothesized that dietary supplementation of <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>proteins</b> would increase the availability of amino acids for the gut wall and therefore result in an improved small intestinal integrity and growth performance of piglets after weaning. The five diets differed in their protein composition: soybean meal and wheat gluten (SBM+WG), SBM and hydrolysed wheat gluten (SBM +HWG), hydrolysed soybean meal and WG (HSBM+WG), SBM and potato protein (SBM+PP), 2 % of gln added to SBM and PP (SBM+PP+gln).

Other phosphoryl transfer enzymes employ more than one divalent ion for the enzymatic reaction.

This effect is not due to a different stoichiometry of metal ion binding, since one metal ion is sufficient for full enzymatic activity. To determine the role of the metal ion, the crystal structure of p 21 (G 12 P) ·GppCp complexed with Mn 2 + was determined and shown to be very similar to the corresponding p 21 (G 12 P) ·GppCp·Mg 2 + structure. Especially the coordination sphere around the metal ions is very similar, and no second metal ion binding site could be detected, consistent with the assumption that one metal ion is sufficient for GTP hydrolysis. In order to explain the biochemical differences, we analysed the GTPase reaction mechanism with a linear free energy relationships approach. The result suggests that the reaction mechanism is not changed with Mn 2 + but that the transition metal ion Mn 2 + shifts the pKa of the γ-phosphate by almost half a unit and increases the reaction rate due to an increase in the basicity of GTP acting as the general base. This suggests that the intrinsic GTPase reaction could be an attractive target for anti-cancer drug design.

In addition, the effects of low- and high-molecular-weight (LMW and HMW respectively) digestion products were investigated. After in vitro digestion and dialysis a lower percentage of N, Fe and Zn was found in the LMW fractions from beef, pork and soyabean proteins when the protein level was increased from 10 to 30 g/kg; the higher level of protein being associated with a lower percentage of hydrolysed protein. The highest percentage levels of intrinsic Fe were always found in the HMW fractions, independent of the type and the level of proteins studied, while in the case of Zn, both HMW and LMW fractions gave similar values. An interaction was found between inorganic Zn and non-haem-Fe. The addition of inorganic Zn (10 μg/ml) caused a significant decrease in the in vitro availability of Fe from soyabean protein, while it did not affect the dialysability of intrinsic Fe from beef and pork proteins. Our results showed that the type and the level of the protein had a positive effect on the dialysability of extrinsic Fe. We postulate that the effect of a protein on the absorption of extrinsic Fe could be accounted for by free amino acids and/or small peptides released during the digestion process and also by the undigested or partially-digested HMW fractions of <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>proteins</b> which could play a fundamental role in the availability of this essential element...|$|E

Extensive medical and clinical research has led to advances in the nutritional quality of infant formula; however, relatively few {{studies have focused on}} interactions between nutrients and the manufacturing process. The objective of this research was to investigate the impact of composition and processing parameters on physical behaviour of high dry matter (DM) IMF systems with a view to designing more sustainable manufacturing processes. The study showed that commercial IMF, with similar compositions, manufactured by different processes, had markedly different physical properties in dehydrated or reconstituted state. Commercial products made with hydrolysed protein were more heat stable compared to products made with intact protein, however, emulsion quality was compromised. Heat-induced denaturation of whey proteins resulted in increased viscosity of wet-mixes, an effect that was dependant on both whey concentration and interactions with lactose and caseins. Expanding on fundamental laboratory studies, a novel high velocity steam injection process was developed whereby high DM (60 %) wet-mixes with lower denaturation/viscosity compared to conventional processes could be achieved; powders produced using this process were of similar quality to those manufactured conventionally. <b>Hydrolysed</b> <b>proteins</b> were also shown to be an effective way of reducing viscosity in heat-treated high DM wet-mixes.

The matrix of characteristics versus species is implemented in a data model running in the expert system ‘Determinator’ for facilitating identification...|$|E
40|$|Colic, {{regurgitation}} and constipation {{are common}} feeding problems in formula-fed infants that {{might benefit from}} dietary treatment. A formula containing fructo- and galacto-oligosaccharides, partially <b>hydrolysed</b> <b>proteins,</b> low levels of lactose and palmitic acid in the β position and higher density has been tested to reduce the occurrence of these symptoms. The aim of this prospective study was to describe the effects of such a formula in infants with minor gastrointestinal disorders. Methods: An observational prospective trial involving practising Italian paediatricians was performed. Formula fed-infants up to 90 d of age with minor gastrointestinal problems such as infantile colics and/or regurgitation and/or constipation {{were enrolled in the}} study from January 2001 to May 2001. The study was completed within 14 d of treatment. On days 1, 7 and 14 the infants were visited by the paediatricians. Parents were given a structured diary to record daily episodes of colic, regurgitation and type and number of stools. Results: Of the 932 infants enrolled, 604 completed the study. Of the 214 infants with colic, 169 (79 %) demonstrated a reduction in frequency of colic from 4. 1 ± 2. 0 per day {{at the beginning of the}} study to 2. 0 ± 1. 8 at the end of the study (I. C. 95 %: 1. 72 – 2. 39; p 6). The evaluation by the paediatricians of the improvement in symptoms after the treatment was 8. 2 ± 1. 5; 574 (95 %) a positive effect (score > 6). Conclusion: This study shows that the majority of infants followed by paediatricians for minor gastrointestinal symptoms improve within 2 wk of feeding with this new formula. Further double-blind, controlled studies are needed to confirm whether the amelioration of symptoms observed in this trial is in fact due to the new formula...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Wheat is {{the most}} {{important}} foodstuff of the cereals in view of its yield and consumption quantity in the world. However, allergens in wheat {{become one of the most}} severe medical problems. Therefore, recent research progresses on allergens of wheat were reviewed in this paper. Some allergens in wheat, for example, wheat lipid transfer protein, ω- 5 gliadin, and α-amylase inhibit, have been analysed clearly, whereas others, salt-soluble <b>protein,</b> <b>hydrolysed</b> wheat <b>proteins,</b> wheat-germ agglutinin, and polysaccharide, were an obscure explanation...|$|R
2500|$|Trypsin (...) is a serine {{protease}} from the PA clan superfamily, {{found in the}} digestive system of many vertebrates, where it <b>hydrolyses</b> <b>proteins.</b> Trypsin is formed in the small intestine when its proenzyme form, the trypsinogen produced by the pancreas, is activated. Trypsin cleaves peptide chains mainly at the carboxyl side of the amino acids lysine or arginine, except when either is followed by proline. It is used for numerous biotechnological processes. The process is {{commonly referred to as}} trypsin proteolysis or trypsinisation, and proteins that have been digested/treated with trypsin are said to have been trypsinized. Trypsin was discovered in 1876 by Wilhelm Kühne.|$|R
