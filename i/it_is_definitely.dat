25|$|The album titled Mercenary was {{released}} on 8 September 1998 in Europe and on 10 November 1998 in the USA, and features 9 tracks. It is an overall slower album than its predecessors. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> very heavy and sounds very much like classic Bolt Thrower. Karl also returned to performing his previous style of singing; the hardcore punk influences have disappeared again. After the album recording, Karl left the band again and the band recruited Dave Ingram permanently after he left Benediction.|$|E
25|$|There {{were few}} health care {{facilities}} other than local General Practitioner surgeries within the Municipality of Clarence prior to the Tasman Bridge Disaster. The isolation caused by the severing of the bridge, and the inability of patients to travel across the river for treatment highlighted the need for local health care services on the eastern shore. The Bayfield Healthcare Centre (now known as the Clarence Community Health Centre) was developed at considerable cost to the state government, but soon became the City's primary health care provider. Whilst <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> not {{large enough to be}} considered a hospital, recent upgrading has seen the centre fall into the super clinic category.|$|E
25|$|Like many of Butler’s strong female African-American characters, Anyanwu {{is put in}} {{conflict}} with a male character, Doro, who is just as powerful as her. Butler uses this type of mis-match to display how differently males and females demonstrate their power and values. Since Anyanwu’s way, J. Andrew Deman notes, “is {{the way of the}} healer” rather than of the killer, she does not need violence to demonstrate her true strength or power. As Gant-Britton states, Anyanwu’s true power is shown many times during the story but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> displayed when she threatens to commit suicide if Doro does not stop using her to create new species, making Doro submissive “to her will in the name of love,” if only for a moment.|$|E

500|$|In the day {{following}} the Olympic team finals, Sacramone was largely {{blamed for the}} American team's silver medal placement, and {{was the subject of}} negative commentary in media reports. Sacramone herself took responsibility for the results, saying, [...] "It's kinda hard not to blame myself." [...] However, analysts in the gymnastics community, including University of Georgia head coach Suzanne Yoculan, former Olympian John Roethlisberger and International Gymnast editor Paul Ziert, noted that the American team started the competition at a difficult point deficit to the Chinese and that mathematically, Sacramone could not have been personally or exclusively responsible for the U.S. team's results. Teammate Bridget Sloan also said in an interview, [...] "We've all made mistakes. It's just really hard to see her go and leave these Olympics knowing that she thinks it's her fault. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> not, and we've all been encouraging her very much." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Stay in Love" [...] is a [...] "beat-driven" [...] and [...] "piano-laced" [...] ballad, that is {{influenced}} by pop and R music genres. The song's instrumentation is derived from a piano melody, and is backed by a strong computerized drum-beat. It is composed in the key of D major, with Carey's vocals spanning from the low note of D3 to the high note of G5. The song moves at a slow tempo of 65 beats per minute in cut time, and it follows a chord progression of D–Bm7–G–A. [...] The song features a [...] "double voice" [...] effect during its final chorus, where Carey's normal singing tone {{throughout the rest of}} the song is combined with her raised pitch. She raises the pitch one octave, and layers it over her normal tone. Lyrically, the song finds Carey getting [...] "her cry on with the connect-the-dots break-up track." [...] She describes the old time she shared with her lover. She also admits that even though they did attempt to save their relationship, and that she knows that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> over, she still [...] "stays in love with him".|$|E
500|$|Critics also approvingly {{compared}} it to Mariah Carey's modern Christmas classic [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] (1994), a track that RCA chief executive Peter Edge described as the song's inspiration. Williot added that [...] "Underneath the Tree" [...] is strong enough that it could enter the pantheon of modern Christmas staples like Carey's [...] "All I Want For Christmas Is You" [...] and 'N Sync's [...] "Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays". Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV News remarked, [...] "if we may be so bold, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> on par with other impeccable Christmas originals—namely Carey's [...] "All I Want For Christmas Is You"." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted the similar themes of two songs, and that [...] "Underneath the Tree" [...] {{is likely to become}} Clarkson's very own contemporary standard. Melinda Newman of HitFix wrote, [...] "It's a finger-popping, bell-ringing pleaser that could achieve that rare feat of becoming a new Christmas standard. That hasn't happened since Carey's [...] "All I Want For Christmas" [...] in 1994;" [...] while The Independents Hugh Montgomery applauded it as having a sass, jingle and a sax solo, saying that it is [...] "a winner on all fronts." ...|$|E

500|$|A major {{point of}} {{criticism}} the film faced was regarding {{the possibility of}} Army attacking students in a radio station. When Rakeysh was questioned about the same in a scriptwriter's conference conducted by the Film Writers Association in the year 2008, he said the following, [...] "So, in 2005, in Allahabad, a bunch of 4 students took the TV station there, and they were shot dead. Everything I did, {{it was kind of}} was kind of borrowed, as I said right here. Obviously, what I am also learning is the way I tell a story is not real; you can term it as a-real. For maximum impact, for the message to go through, I felt—since the story was against the establishment—let the establishment do it. After all, the establishment did hang Bhagat Singh. After all, the establishment did come down on the innocent, innocent students in Mandal Commission. After all the establishment did come down on Tiananmen Square. After all the establishment did come down when the whole concept of Flower Power emerged in America. So it's all there. It's borrowed, maybe not as realistically, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> there in the society. During emergency, there are horror stories. If {{we have to go back}} to Kriplani and his movement in Bihar, the stories are absolutely horrific." ...|$|E

Lexie and O'Malley {{discover}} {{that he only}} failed his exam by a single point, leading him to confront Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), the chief of surgery, {{to ask for a}} chance to retake the exam. He passes the second attempt, and begins to distance himself from Lexie, who has fallen in love with him. O'Malley supports Stevens when she discovers she has melanoma, and walks her down the aisle as she marries Karev. O'Malley begins to display a talent for trauma surgery, and is told by the chief of trauma surgery Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> his specialty. He then abruptly and inexplicably decides to join the U.S. Army. While his friends at the hospital prepare an intervention to convince O'Malley to stay, they all work on a severely disfigured John Doe, brought in after a horrible bus accident, in which he pushed a woman {{out of the way and}} saved her life. When Meredith goes to check on John Doe, he seems to recognize her and will not let go of her hand. After several attempts at trying, he succeeds in tracing [...] "007" [...] on Meredith's hand. Shocked, she realizes [...] "John Doe" [...] is in fact O'Malley. She informs the other surgeons and they rush him to surgery. However, he flatlines and is ultimately declared braindead. His organs are donated after Stevens confirms that is what O'Malley would have wanted, and he is buried a week later.|$|E
