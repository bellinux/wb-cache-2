Polarimetric data were acquired in March 1988 with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory multifrequency airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) during the Beaufort Sea Flight Campaign.

This emulator is able to simulate polarimetric radar measurements at weather radar frequency bands and can take as input the prognostic variables of high-resolution nonhydrostatic NWP model simulations using one-, two-, and three-moment microphysics schemes. The new emulator is tested at 10. 7 cm wavelength with a model-simulated supercell storm using a double-moment (DM, or two-moment) microphysics scheme to examine its ability to simulate <b>polarimetric</b> <b>signatures</b> reported in the observational studies. The simulated fields exhibit realistic <b>polarimetric</b> <b>signatures</b> that include ZDR and KDP columns; ZDR arc, mid-level ZDR and ρhv rings; and hail signature {{in terms of the}} general location, shape and strength. We compared the simulation to one employing a single-moment microphysics scheme and found that certain signatures, such as ZDR arc and mid-level ZDR and ρhv rings, cannot be reproduced with the latter.

These results suggest that two- or higher-moment microphysics should be used to adequately describe certain important microphysical processes in supercell storms.

Additionally, another objective is an exploratory analysis of scattering mechanisms of forest typology in accordance with the alternative procedure of SAR image classification based on target decomposition. The area under study is located at the Tapajós region (Brazil). At the representation of <b>polarimetric</b> <b>signatures,</b> the normalized cross-section of the forest target (σ) was plotted on a three-dimensional graphic as a function of the orientation angle, ellipticity angle, referring to the ellipse of polarization. The resulting surfaces were visually compared and the configuration of each plot was analyzed with support of physiognomic-structural information collected during forest inventories. On the other hand, the distinction between simple and multiple scattering mechanism from the target decomposition was done by the association of entropy and alpha angle values for each sample area.

40|$|In this thesis, {{the problem}} of {{stationary}} target detection, segmentation and classification in Through-the-Wall Radar Imaging (TWRI) is considered. In stationary target detection, Doppler and change-detection-based techniques are inapplicable. A new feature-set that depends on <b>polarimetric</b> <b>signatures</b> and co-occurrence matrices are employed. Algorithms for 2 D and 3 D segmentation and classification are adapted, investigated and tested. The utilization of these algorithms to the application of TWRI is investigated, with special focus on the feature extraction and target classification phases. A combination of <b>polarimetric</b> <b>signatures</b> and features extracted from co-occurrence matrices is proposed. Two different schemes that deal with 2 D and 3 D arrangements are proposed. The first scheme {{is based on a}} fusion of two dimensional segmentation and classification. The proposed scheme uses features from polarimetric B-scan images to segment and classify the image observations into target, clutter, and noise segments. Target <b>polarimetric</b> <b>signatures</b> from co-polarized and cross-polarized target returns are mapped to a pixel-by-pixel feature space. The image is then over-segmented to homogeneous regions called super-pixels. Homogeneous super-pixels are optionally grouped into clusters and then assigned to corresponding classes. This scheme relies on novel features and the relations between the different pixels. The second scheme deals with the 3 D scene directly instead of 2 D B-Scans. The proposed scheme uses clustering as an initial phase using intensity and spatial features for each voxel. Clusters that contain mostly noise are ruled out. Further feature extraction using features from the multivariate co-occurrence matrices and <b>polarimetric</b> <b>signatures</b> is applied to the voxels of the remaining cluster(s). Subsequently, the voxels are classified using different classifiers to test the usefulness of the features. This method is designed for practical applications in which the target detection should be performed in real time. The clustering step is used to detect the target positions quickly. Further steps are used to obtain more accurate estimates of the target positions and shapes, and further classify the clustered voxels. All proposed methods are evaluated using real data measurements.

Prior to the launch of WindSat, it was commonly believed that land <b>polarimetric</b> <b>signatures</b> at satellite footprint scales are below instrumental noise levels {{and do not have}} any useful geophysical information. On the contrary, WindSat polarimetric data exhibit distinct geophysical and observation geometry signatures, particularly over Greenland and Antarctic where the signatures are related to snow accumulation, melting and metamorphism. The third and fourth Stokes parameters show well defined, large azimuth modulation which is correlated with geophysical variations, particularly with snow metamorphism, and has consistent seasonal variation. We use simple empirical models to separate and quantify such azimuthal modulations and geophysical changes. By comparing the temporal variations of harmonic coefficients and brightness temperature signatures in vertical and horizontal polarization channels, we find that both volume and surface scattering have important contributions to the <b>polarimetric</b> <b>signature.</b> Such signatures are relatively weak in the summer, when sastrugi are small and surface scattering is significant, and are strongest in spring, when the sastrugi are larger and volume scattering is important.

40|$|A polarimetric {{scattering}} {{model is}} developed to study effects of snow cover and frost flowers with brine infiltration on thin sea ice. Leads containing thin sea {{ice in the}} Artic icepack are important to heat exchange with the atmosphere and salt flux into the upper ocean. Surface characteristics of thin sea ice in leads are dominated by the formation of frost flowers with high salinity. In many cases, the thin sea ice layer is covered by snow, which wicks up brine from sea ice due to capillary force. Snow and frost flowers {{have a significant impact}} on <b>polarimetric</b> <b>signatures</b> of thin ice, which needs to be studied for accessing the retrieval of geophysical parameters such as ice thickness. Frost flowers or snow layer is modeled with a heterogeneous mixture consisting of randomly oriented ellipsoids and brine infiltration in an air background. Ice crystals are characterized with three different axial lengths to depict the nonspherical shape. Under the covering multispecies medium, the columinar sea-ice layer is an inhomogeneous anisotropic medium composed of ellipsoidal brine inclusions preferentially oriented in the vertical direction in an ice background. The underlying medium is homogeneous sea water. This configuration is described with layered inhomogeneous media containing multiple species of scatterers. The species are allowed to have different size, shape, and permittivity. The strong permittivity fluctuation theory is extended to account for the multispecies in the derivation of effective permittivities with distributions of scatterer orientations characterized by Eulerian rotation angles. Polarimetric backscattering coefficients are obtained consistently with the same physical description used in the effective permittivity calculation. The mulitspecies model allows the inclusion of high-permittivity species to study effects of brine infiltrated snow cover and frost flowers on thin ice. The results suggest that the frost cover with a rough interface significantly increases the backscatter from thin saline ice and the <b>polarimetric</b> <b>signature</b> becomes closer to the isotropic characteristics.
