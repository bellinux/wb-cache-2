40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the {{efficacy}} of violence prevention programs on the attitudes toward <b>guns</b> and <b>violence</b> among students in grades three through seven. This study represents an attempt to prove that third through sixth grade students who receive anger control training and seventh grade students who receive conflict resolution training will show a significantly lower attraction towards <b>guns</b> and <b>violence</b> than students receiving no such training. By understanding interrelation between adolescents 2 ̆ 7 attitudes towards <b>guns</b> and <b>violence</b> and their psychosocial functioning, the public can seek out ways of preventing violence. To measure the impact and to provide information about the program 2 ̆ 7 s strengths and weaknesses, the Attitudes toward <b>Guns</b> and <b>Violence</b> Questionnaire (AGVQ) was used. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was utilized to assess the differences in attitudes towards <b>guns</b> and <b>violence</b> between groups that participated in violence prevention programs and those who did not. Anger control training and conflict resolution training, as conducted in this manner and in this setting, did not lead to a significantly lower attraction towards <b>guns</b> and <b>violence...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Gun Court is {{the branch}} of the Jamaican {{judicial}} system that tries criminal cases involving firearms. The Court was established by Parliament in 1974 to combat rising <b>gun</b> <b>violence,</b> and empowered to try suspects in camera, without a jury. The Supreme Court, Circuit Courts, and Resident Magistrate's Courts function as Gun Courts whenever they hear firearms cases. There is also a Western Regional Gun Court in Montego Bay. Those convicted by the Gun Court are imprisoned in a dedicated prison compound at South Camp in Kingston. Until 1999, the Gun Court sessions were also held in the same facility.|$|E

A low Joe Bob Briggs Breast Count - one scene - however, liberal use of fake blood, {{explicit}} language (no F bombs), <b>guns,</b> <b>violence,</b> drugs and sexual innuendo. Fantastic low-budget movie with a big name cast including Shelley Winters, Robert De Niro, Bruce Dern, Don Stroud, Robert Walden and Diane Varsi.

5|$|The long {{sentences}} of the Gun Court and its {{restrictions on the}} rights of the accused have given rise to constitutional challenges, some of which have been appealed to the Privy Council in London. These cases have resulted in some modifications to the court, but have upheld it on the whole. The Gun Court system has also been the target of criticism because of its lengthy delay in hearing cases, and the continuing rise in <b>gun</b> <b>violence</b> since its adoption.|$|E

Eventually an agreement was reached which resulted in PepsiCo donating $3 million to Ludacris' foundation and other inner city charities.|$|R

5|$|Nanako Kato, a {{spokesperson}} from Sony Computer Entertainment, addressed the matter from Tokyo. She {{pointed out that}} historical buildings are often used in entertainment, such as in iconic movie scenes involving Godzilla and the Tokyo Tower and King Kong in Manhattan. She acknowledged {{the church in the}} game holds a resemblance to Manchester Cathedral, but that the point was to depict a backdrop of an old church, not to illustrate a specific church. She added that Sony understands why the Church of England was offended especially because of its efforts to reduce the serious problem of <b>gun</b> <b>violence</b> in Manchester. She did not answer on whether Sony would donate money to the Cathedral's anti-gun program as the Church has demanded. At the time, over 2million copies of the game had been sold.|$|E

5000|$|Michael Britto's collages {{have also}} gained {{interest}} {{because of his}} ability to combine very familiar and [...] "haunting images" [...] to create [...] "jarring formations."
