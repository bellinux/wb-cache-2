5|$|The Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society (BMSHS) is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit {{organization}} {{committed to}} local preservation, research, and education. In March 1974, after the village mayor appointed twelve {{people for a}} 75th anniversary committee, the committee began by forming the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society, which received its provisional charter around that time. The historical society published an updated village history (A Village Between Two Rivers: Briarcliff Manor) in 1977, marking the 75th anniversary of the village. The organization has since published several books, including a comprehensive history of the village. The publication, The Changing Landscape, a History of Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough, was written by Mary Cheever, wife of novelist John Cheever. In 2016, the society and village government created and dedicated a memorial to Medal of Honor recipient John <b>Koelsch</b> at Law Memorial Park.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 30 {{people from}} Briarcliff Manor {{served in the}} Korean War. John Kelvin <b>Koelsch,</b> who lived in Scarborough and {{attended}} the Scarborough School, died in a Korean prison camp after three months in captivity. Briarcliff Manor celebrated its semicentennial celebration from October 10–12, 1952, publishing {{a book about the}} village and its history; that year, the Crossroads neighborhood of 84 houses was completed. In 1953, Todd Elementary School opened to free space at the Law Park grade school for middle- and high-school students. The Putnam Division was discontinued in 1958, and the following year the village library reopened in the former train station. The village's first corporate facility (part of Philips Laboratory) opened in 1960. In 1964 the new Village Hall opened, replacing the Municipal Building. The present high school opened in 1971 to ease the large enrollment at the grade-school building, and the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society was founded from the village's 75th anniversary committee, in 1974. Pace University bought Briarcliff College in 1977 as a satellite of the school's Pleasantville campus. Also in 1977, the village celebrated its 75th anniversary. Events included a motorcade of fifteen old racing cars participating in a loop around the route of Briarcliff Manor's 1934 road race.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the neurobiology of speech and music has been investigated {{for more than a}} century. There remains no widespread agreement regarding how (or to what extent) music perception utilizes the neural circuitry that is engaged in speech processing, particularly at the cortical level. Prominent models such as Patel’s Shared Syntactic Integration Resource Hypothesis (SSIRH) and <b>Koelsch’s</b> neurocognitive model of music perception suggest a high degree of overlap, particularly in the frontal lobe, but also perhaps more distinct representations in the temporal lobe with hemispheric asymmetries. The present meta-analysis study used activation likelihood estimate analyses to identify the brain regions consistently activated for music as compared to speech across the functional neuroimaging (fMRI and PET) literature. Eighty music and 91 speech neuroimaging studies of healthy adult control subjects were analyzed. Peak activations reported in the music and speech studies were divided into four paradigm categories: passive listening, discrimination tasks, error/anomaly detection tasks and memory-related tasks. We then compared activation likelihood estimates within each category for music versus speech, and each music condition with passive listening. We found that listening to music and to speech preferentially activate distinct temporo-parietal bilateral cortical networks. We also found music and speech to have shared resources in the left pars opercularis but speech-specific resources in the left pars triangularis. The extent to which music recruited speech-activated frontal resources was modulated by task. While there are certainly limitations to meta-analysis techniques particularly regarding sensitivity, this work suggests that the extent of shared resources between speech and music may be task-dependent and highlights the need to consider how task effects may be affecting conclusions regarding the neurobiology of speech and music...|$|R

500|$|Walter W. Law Memorial Park (originally Liberty Park), in {{the center}} of the village on Pleasantville Road, is a [...] park which was donated to the village by Law in 1904. Its outdoor pool complex, added in July 1927 at a cost of $8,641 ($ in [...] ), has a [...] wading pool and a [...] main pool, which was Westchester's first public {{swimming}} pool. After a complete reconstruction of the pool in 1977, a two-story bathhouse and pavilion was completed in 2001 as part of a rehabilitation project, which included paved walkways and a veterans' memorial. The park was rededicated on Veterans Day 2001. It has four lighted tennis courts: three clay and one all-weather. The pond was used for ice skating and hockey until the village bought a temporary rink for one of the tennis courts; the shallow rink freezes days earlier than the pond, and the tennis court lighting system allows easier skating at night. Adjacent to the tennis courts is a playground. Two platform tennis courts are north of the park, and the Briarcliff Manor Public Library and Community Center is on its eastern edge. In 2016, a memorial to Medal of Honor recipient John <b>Koelsch</b> was constructed in the park and dedicated on Veterans Day that year.|$|E
2500|$|In a model {{outlined}} by Stefan <b>Koelsch</b> and Walter Siebel, music stimuli are perceived in a successive timeline, {{breaking down the}} auditory input into different characteristics and meaning. He maintained that upon perception the sound reaches the auditory nerve, brainstem and thalamus. At this point features involving pitch height, chroma, timbre, intensity and roughness are extracted. This occurs about at about 10–100ms. Next, melodic and rhythmic grouping occurs, which is then perceived by auditory sensory memory. After this, an analysis is made of intervals and chord progressions. A harmony is then built upon the structure of metre, rhythm and timbre. This occurs from about 180–400ms after the initial perception. Following this, structural reanalysis and repair occur, at about 600–900ms. Finally, the autonomic nervous system and multimodal association cortices are activated. <b>Koelsch</b> and Siebel proposed that from about 250–500ms, based on the sound's meaning, interpretation and emotion occurs continuously throughout this process. This is indicated by N400, a negative spike at 400ms, as measured by an [...] "event related potential".|$|E
5000|$|USS <b>Koelsch</b> (FF-1049) was a [...] {{destroyer}} escort, later reclassified as a frigate, in the United States Navy.

On 3 July 1951, <b>Koelsch</b> and his crewman attempted to rescue a downed Marine aviator from enemy territory. Under heavy fire, Koelschs helicopter was shot down; <b>Koelsch,</b> his crewman, and the Marine aviator survived the crash and evaded the enemy for nine days before being captured.

50|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} of July 3, 1951, <b>Koelsch</b> responded to a distress call from a Marine aviator, Capt. James V. Wilkins, whose Corsair {{had been hit by}} enemy fire during an armed reconnaissance mission about 35 miles southwest of Wonsan. Capt. Wilkins parachuted from his burning plane at low altitude; and survived despite being severely burned about the legs. Despite approaching darkness, worsening weather, and enemy ground fire, Lt. <b>Koelsch</b> located the downed aviator in the Anbyon Valley and began his pickup. Thick fog prevented the air cover from protecting the unarmed HO3S helicopter, and intense enemy fire downed the craft as the Lieutenant's crewman, George M. Neal, AM3, hoisted the injured pilot toward the helicopter. All three men survived the crash; and, after hiding in the mountains from enemy patrols for 3 days, they began a slow march to the coast. After 6 more days, they reached a coastal village where they were captured the following day while hiding in a hut. During his captivity, though beaten and abused, <b>Koelsch</b> refused to aid his captors or submit to interrogation. His fortitude and personal bravery inspired his fellow prisoners. John <b>Koelsch</b> died of malnutrition and dysentery on October 16, 1951, while a prisoner of war. On August 3, 1955, Lieutenant (Junior Grade) John Kelvin <b>Koelsch</b> was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in Korea.|$|E

50|$|Most linguists, however, would {{reject the}} notion that music can {{transfer}} specific semantic concepts (Pinker, Norton, New York 1997, How the Mind Works).

5000|$|Minor {{neurological}} differences regarding hemispheric processing {{exist between}} brains {{of males and}} females. <b>Koelsch,</b> Maess, Grossmann and Friederici (2003) investigated music processing through EEG and ERPs and discovered gender differences. [...] Findings showed that females process music information bilaterally and males process music with a right-hemispheric predominance. However, the early negativity of males was also present over the left hemisphere. This indicates that males do not exclusively utilize the right hemisphere for musical information processing. In a follow-up study, <b>Koelsch,</b> Grossman, Gunter, Hahne, Schroger and Friederici (2003) found that boys show lateralization of the early anterior negativity in the left hemisphere but found a bilateral effect in girls. [...] This indicates a developmental effect as early negativity is lateralized in the right hemisphere in men and in the left hemisphere in boys.|$|E
50|$|From this facts {{it can be}} {{reasoned}} that the ERAN relies on neural resources related to syntactic processing (<b>Koelsch</b> 2008).

5000|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the human brain has an {{implicit}} musical ability. [...] <b>Koelsch,</b> Gunter, Friederici and Schoger (2000) investigated the influence of preceding musical context, task relevance of unexpected chords and the degree of probability of violation on music processing in both musicians and non-musicians. Findings showed that the human brain unintentionally extrapolates expectations about impending auditory input. Even in non-musicians, the extrapolated expectations are consistent with music theory. The ability to process information musically supports the idea of an implicit musical ability in the human brain. In a follow-up study, <b>Koelsch,</b> Schroger, and Gunter (2002) investigated whether ERAN and N5 could be evoked preattentively in non-musicians. Findings showed that both ERAN and N5 can be elicited even in a situation where the musical stimulus is ignored by the listener indicating that there is a highly differentiated preattentive musicality in the human brain.|$|E
