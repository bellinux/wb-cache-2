40|$|The study {{aimed to}} compare the <b>fall</b> <b>characteristics</b> between parkinsonian single (P-SF) and {{recurrent}} fallers (P-RF), and the clinical features among parkinsonian non-fallers (P-NF), P-SF, P-RF and age-matched healthy controls. As many as 72 patients with PD and 74 healthy subjects completed the study. Each subject was evaluated for gait speed, timed up-and-go test, one-leg-stance test, six-minute walk test, five-times-sit-to-stand test, and Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale at baseline. Subjects were then followed up for 12 months by telephone interview to record the fall incidence and <b>fall</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Among the PD patients, 12 fell once (P-SF) and 13 fell 2 - 29 times (P-RF), accounting {{for a total of}} 133 falls in the 12 -month follow-up period. The most common fall-related activity for both P-SF and P-RF was walking. P-SF fell mostly outdoors due to "tripping", while P-RF mostly fell at home due to "muscle giving way". Clinical measures indicated that P-SF did not differ from P-NF. However, P-RF had significantly longer five-times-sit-to-stand time, shorter 6 -min walk distance, and lower ABC score than P-SF. P-RF could be distinguished from P-SF by <b>fall</b> <b>characteristics</b> (i. e. location and perceived causes of falls), and by clinical measures including leg muscle weakness, reduced exercise endurance and increased level of fear of falling. Findings from the present study suggest that P-NF/P-SF and P-RF may require different intervention strategies to prevent future falls. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R

40|$|Many {{elderly people}} {{experience}} difficulty with independent living after injuries associated with falls. This study aimed {{to examine the}} influence of <b>fall</b> <b>characteristics</b> and physical function level on the severity of fall related injuries. The surveys were conducted in 1955 community dwelling elderly. The questions regarded the following: fall experience {{within the past year}}, fall direction, fall cause, injured parts and degree of injury, and an activity of daily living (ADL) questionnaire from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Japan. Data of 1850 subjects with available and complete responses were used for analysis. Three hundred and eighty-six (20. 9 %) elderly people experienced a fall within the past year and 257 (66. 7 %) were injured. ADL score was significantly higher in the elderly without fall experience than the elderly with fall experience. No significant difference was found in frequency of fall cause and fall direction between the elderly with and without injuries caused by falling. Significant correlations were found between fall direction and fall cause and injured parts (φ = 0. 49 and 0. 32). ADL score of the elderly who fell by leg backlash was significantly lower than that of the elderly who fell by tripping, slipping and staggering. A decrease of ADL affects the rate of falls in the elderly, but not the degree of injury. <b>Fall</b> <b>characteristics</b> may not be related to the extent of fall injury. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Curve squeal in railway {{vehicles}} is an instability {{mechanism that}} arises in tight curves under certain running and environmental conditions. In developing a model {{the most important}} elements are the characterisation of friction coupled with an accurate representation of the structural dynamics of the wheel. However, {{the role played by}} the dynamics of the rail is not fully understood and it is unclear whether this should be included in a model or whether it can be safely neglected. This paper makes use of previously developed time domain and frequency domain curve squeal models to assess whether the presence of the rail and the <b>falling</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the friction force can modify the instability mechanisms and the final response. For this purpose, the time-domain model has been updated to include the rail dynamics in terms of its state space representation in various directions.

Information collected included details about {{the part of the}} body to strike the ground, direction of the fall, level of trauma and whether or not injury or fracture was sustained. RESULTS [...] One hundred and seventy two subjects reported a fall in the previous four months. Restricting analysis to the 142 subjects who fell from a standing height or less, females aged 50 - 64 years were {{more than twice as likely}} to fall onto their hand compared with older females (odds ratio (OR) = 2. 2; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 8 to 6. 2) and at all ages (50 +) were more than three times as likely to fall on their hip compared with males (OR = 3. 4; 95 % CI 1. 0 to 11. 5). Compared with older males, males aged 50 - 64 were more likely to fall sideways (OR = 5. 1; 95 % CI 1. 5 to 17. 4) and less likely to fall forwards (OR = 0. 4; 95 % CI 0. 1 to 1. 1).

40|$|Objectives: To examine {{differences}} in <b>fall</b> <b>characteristics</b> and emergency service response to older fallers (≥ 65 years of age), considering their use, or not, {{of a personal}} alarm. Methods: A retrospective one month audit of South Australian Ambulance Service records was conducted. Characteristics of ambulance call-outs for falls or alarm activations were described (Sample 1). Alarm-activated services for older fallers were matched (by day and type of service) with fallers who did not use a personal alarm (Sample 2). Results In Sample 1, 379 of 1700 callers used a personal alarm to call the ambulance, although 58 % these alarm-activated calls were false alarms (neither lift nor hospital transport service provided). From Sample 2, most alarm calls were made by females (72 %) alone {{at the time of}} fall (78 %). Ambulance response time did not differ between alarm (median= 11 mins) and non-alarm users (median= 14 minutes, p= 0. 56). The difference reflects a clinically non-critical difference in non-life threatening cases. 82 % of alarm users and 75 % of non-alarm users were on the ground when the ambulance arrived. Of non-alarm users, 11 were self-reported 'long lies' (>one hour) before the ambulance was called, and there were 13 other cases with unknown time on the floor. This compared with 11 self-reported long lies in alarm users. Conclusion Older women living alone were the major users of personal alarms for assistance after falling. If activated quickly, alarms enabled most fallers to gain ambulance attention within 15 minutes. However, personal alarm use was also associated with a high incidence of false alarms. ...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{algorithms}} {{and growth}} of computational resources in the past decades have enabled simulations of sediment transport processes with unprecedented fidelities. The Computational Fluid Dynamics [...] Discrete Element Method (CFD [...] DEM) {{is one of the}} high-fidelity approaches, where the motions of and collisions among the sediment grains as well as their interactions with surrounding fluids are resolved. In most DEM solvers the particles are modeled as soft spheres due to computational efficiency and implementation complexity considerations, although natural sediments are usually mixture of non-spherical particles. Previous attempts to extend sphere-based DEM to treat irregular particles neglected fluid-induced torques on particles, and the method lacked flexibility to handle sediments with an arbitrary mixture of particle shapes. In this contribution we proposed a simple, efficient approach to represent common sediment grain shapes with bonded spheres, where the fluid forces are computed and applied on each sphere. The proposed approach overcomes the aforementioned limitations of existing methods and has improved efficiency and flexibility over existing approaches. We use numerical simulations to demonstrate the merits and capability of the proposed method in predicting the <b>falling</b> <b>characteristics,</b> terminal velocity, threshold of incipient motion, and transport rate of natural sediments. The simulations show that the proposed method is a promising approach for faithful representation of natural sediment, which leads to accurate simulations of their transport dynamics. The proposed method also opens the possibility for first-principle-based simulations of the flocculation and sedimentation dynamics of cohesive sediments. Elucidation of these physical mechanisms can provide much needed improvement on the prediction capability and physical understanding of muddy coast dynamics...|$|R

A questionnaire was used for collecting demographic background, comorbid medical conditions, and <b>fall</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Depression status was evaluated by the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form. Results: The prevalence of fall and recurrent falls were 17. 2 % and 6. 9 %, respectively. The injury rate after falls was 51. 9 %. The advanced age [odds ratio (OR) : 1. 04; confidence interval (CI) : 1. 01 – 1. 07), depression status (OR: 1. 05; CI: 1. 01 – 1. 10), stroke (OR: 2. 16; CI: 1. 18 – 3. 96), gouty arthritis (OR: 1. 96; CI: 1. 36 – 2. 81), and cataract (OR: 1. 48; CI: 1. 03 – 2. 15) were independent variables associated with falls. We also found that the greater the number of variables, the higher the risk of falling (χ 2 for linear trend =  31. 98, d. f. = 4, p <  0. 001). Furthermore, depression was the only independent variable for predicting recurrent falls (OR: 1. 22; CI: 1. 12 – 1. 32). However, no variable was found to be capable of predicting injurious falls.

40|$|Obese {{adults have}} a lower risk of hip and {{vertebral}} fracture, but {{a greater risk of}} lower limb and proximal humerus fracture, compared to adults with a normal body mass index (BMI). Differences in fracture risk by skeletal site in obesity might be attributed to differences in bone mineral density (BMD), bone microstructure and bone strength between obese and normal BMI individuals and/or differences in physical function, possibly related to fall frequency and/or direction. The role of vitamin D in bone metabolism and physical function in obesity is unclear. The effect of obesity on bone microstructure and strength in young and older, men and women, has not been investigated in a matched case control design. BMD, microstructure and strength were determined using novel imaging technologies. The roles of various adipose compartments and biochemical factors on BMD and microarchitecture were investigated. Physical function and vitamin D metabolism of obese and normal BMI individuals was compared. Younger and older obese adults have higher BMD, favourable microstructure and greater bone strength, but there is a greater difference in BMD and microstructure between obese and normal BMI in older adults than in younger adults. Obese adults have greater bone strength than normal BMI adults, regardless of age. Higher BMD in obesity is associated with lower resorption, possibly mediated by circulating leptin and oestradiol which were, in turn, associated with subcutaneous abdominal adiposity. Obese adults have greater muscle mass but poorer physical performance than normal BMI adults. This might be associated with greater fall frequency and affect fall direction. Obese adults have lower total and free 25 OHD and 1, 25 (OH) 2 D than normal BMI adults, likely due to greater volumetric dilution. Low 25 OHD in obesity does not appear to affect BMD, microstructure or strength, or physical performance. Despite greater BMD and bone strength, obese individuals are at greater risk of some fractures. This might be due to the effect of poor physical function on <b>fall</b> <b>characteristics</b> in obesity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Knowledge {{about the}} {{circumstances}} under which injurious falls occur could provide healthcare workers with better tools to prevent falls and fall-related injuries. Therefore, we assessed whether older persons who sustain an injurious fall can be classified into specific fall types, based on a combination of fall location and activity up to the moment of the fall. In addition, we assessed whether specific injurious fall types are related to causes of the fall, consequences of the <b>fall,</b> socio-demographic <b>characteristics,</b> and health-related characteristics. Methods An exploratory, cross-sectional study design was used to identify injurious fall types. The study population comprised 333 community-dwelling Dutch elderly people aged 65 years or over who attended an accident and emergency department after a fall. All participants received a self-administered questionnaire after being discharged home. The questionnaire comprised items concerning circumstances of the injurious fall, causes of the fall, consequences of the <b>fall,</b> socio-demographic <b>characteristics</b> and health-related <b>characteristics.</b> Injurious <b>fall</b> types were distinguished by analyzing data by means of HOMALS (homogeneity analysis by means of alternating least squares). Results We identified 4 injurious fall types: 1) Indoor falls related to lavatory visits (hall and bathroom); 2) Indoor falls during other activities of daily living; 3) Outdoor falls near the home during instrumental activities of daily living; 4) Outdoor falls away from home, occurring during walking, cycling, and shopping for groceries. These injurious fall types were significantly related to age, cause of the fall, activity avoidance and daily functioning. Conclusion The face validity of the injurious fall typology is obvious. However, we found no relationship between the injurious fall types and severity of the consequences of the fall. Nevertheless, {{there appears to be a}} difference between the prevalence of fractures and the cause of the fall between the injurious fall types. Our data suggests that with regard to prevention of serious injuries, we should pay special attention to outdoor fallers and indoor fallers during lavatory visits. In addition, we should have special attention for causes of the fall. However, the conclusions reached in this exploratory analysis are tentative and need to be validated in a separate dataset. </p...|$|R
