5|$|Apart {{from some}} western troupes' 19th-century visits, the first {{professional}} performance of <b>Hamlet</b> in Japan was Otojirō Kawakami's 1903 Shimpa ("new school theatre") adaptation. Tsubouchi Shōyō translated <b>Hamlet</b> {{and produced a}} performance in 1911 that blended Shingeki ("new drama") and Kabuki styles. This hybrid-genre reached its peak in Tsuneari Fukuda's 1955 <b>Hamlet.</b> In 1998, Yukio Ninagawa produced an acclaimed version of <b>Hamlet</b> {{in the style of}} Nō theatre, which he took to London.|$|E
5|$|As {{the court}} gathers the next day, while King Claudius and Queen Gertrude discuss affairs of state with their elderly adviser Polonius, <b>Hamlet</b> looks on glumly.

50|$|The total {{population}} of Waccabuc is just 445 people. Waccabuc {{is by far the}} smallest of Lewisboro's four <b>hamlets</b> and the <b>hamlet's</b> strict zoning laws ensure that Waccabuc maintains a low population density not seen in any of the other <b>hamlets.</b> These factors combine to separate Waccabuc from the other <b>hamlets</b> of Lewisboro and project an image of exclusivity.|$|R

5|$|NY177 {{begins at}} interchange42 on I-81 {{in the town}} of Adams. The route {{progresses}} away from the interstate to the southeast, passing the former railroad station in Adams Center before intersecting with US11 {{in the center of the}} <b>hamlet.</b> At this intersection, NY177 turns eastward, leaving the populated <b>hamlet</b> for a rural backdrop and into the <b>hamlet</b> of Honeyville. Honeyville consists of little more than a few houses centered on the intersection of NY177 and Fuller Road. After leaving Honeyville, NY177 intersects with CR155, where it turns to the southeast into the town of Rodman. After crossing a creek, the route enters the <b>hamlet</b> of Rodman as a two-lane road through the southern end of the <b>hamlet.</b> During the stretch around Rodman, NY177 intersects with CR85 (Creek Road) and CR97 (Washington Park Road / School Street) before leaving the <b>hamlet.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ophelia {{has also}} been defended by feminist critics, most notably Elaine Showalter. Ophelia is {{surrounded}} by powerful men: her father, brother, and <b>Hamlet.</b> All three disappear: Laertes leaves, <b>Hamlet</b> abandons her, and Polonius dies. Conventional theories had argued that without these three powerful men making decisions for her, Ophelia is driven into madness. Feminist theorists argue that she goes mad with guilt because, when <b>Hamlet</b> kills her father, he has fulfilled her sexual desire to have <b>Hamlet</b> kill her father {{so they can be}} together. Showalter points out that Ophelia has become the symbol of the distraught and hysterical woman in modern culture.|$|E

5|$|The {{protagonist of}} <b>Hamlet</b> is Prince <b>Hamlet</b> of Denmark, {{son of the}} {{recently}} deceased King <b>Hamlet,</b> and nephew of King Claudius, his father's brother and successor. Claudius hastily married King Hamlet's widow, Gertrude, Hamlet's mother, and took the throne for himself. Denmark has a long-standing feud with neighboring Norway, in which King <b>Hamlet</b> slew King Fortinbras of Norway in a battle some years ago. Although Denmark defeated Norway, and the Norwegian throne fell to King Fortinbras's infirm brother, Denmark fears that an invasion led by the dead Norwegian king's son, Prince Fortinbras, is imminent.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Barnes Corners, NY177 {{returns to}} being the two-lane rural roadway, {{progressing}} southeastward through the town of Pinckney. Despite the rural scenery, the route does enter the <b>hamlet</b> of New Boston and the junction with CR23 (Liberty Road). Passing a few farms, the route turns to the northeast near Mile Square Road, and enters the <b>hamlet</b> of Bellwood, within the town of Harrisburg. Bellwood consists of a few houses and an intersection with CR27 and CR28 (Sears Pond Road). Leaving Bellwood, NY177 continues eastward into the <b>hamlet</b> of Windecker, which consists only of a few houses. Leaving Windecker, NY177 bends to the southeast and enters the town of Lowville, passing a few farms and wind turbines before bending into the <b>hamlet</b> of West Lowville. In West Lowville, NY177 intersects with NY12, which continues eastward {{to the village of}} Lowville. NY177 terminates at this intersection.|$|E

It proceeded eastward through the <b>hamlet</b> along Main Street to an interchange with the Southern Tier Expressway (then-NY15 and NY17) just east of the community.

5|$|Gertrude summons <b>Hamlet</b> to {{her room}} to demand an explanation. Meanwhile, Claudius talks to himself about the impossibility of repenting, since he still has {{possession}} of his ill-gotten goods: his brother's crown and wife. He sinks to his knees. <b>Hamlet,</b> {{on his way to}} visit his mother, sneaks up behind him, but does not kill him, reasoning that killing Claudius while he is praying will send him straight to heaven while his father's ghost is stuck in purgatory. In the queen's bedchamber, <b>Hamlet</b> and Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind a tapestry, makes a noise.|$|E
5|$|Hamlet's soliloquies {{have also}} {{captured}} the attention of scholars. <b>Hamlet</b> interrupts himself, vocalising either disgust or agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly and instead blunts the thrust of his thought with wordplay. It is not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, that <b>Hamlet</b> is able to articulate his feelings freely.|$|E

5|$|In the 20th century, feminist critics {{opened up}} new {{approaches}} to Gertrude and Ophelia. New Historicist and cultural materialist critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting to piece together its original cultural environment. They focused on the gender system of early modern England, pointing to the common trinity of maid, wife, or widow, with whores outside of that stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of <b>Hamlet</b> is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old <b>Hamlet.</b> In consequence, <b>Hamlet</b> loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore and dishonest with <b>Hamlet.</b> Ophelia, by some critics, {{can be seen as}} honest and fair; however, {{it is virtually impossible to}} link these two traits, since 'fairness' is an outward trait, while 'honesty' is an inward trait.|$|E
