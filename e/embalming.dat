40|$|Various joint {{positions}} of the upper extremity were used to study the tensile forces on the median nerve. To analyse the effect of embalmment, tensile forces were measured in situ in unembalmed and <b>embalmed</b> human bodies. A positive correlation was found between tensile force data from unembalmed and <b>embalmed</b> nerves. This finding justifies, for comparative studies, the use of <b>embalmed</b> human bodies, although the absolute tensile forces are higher...|$|R
5|$|The ship {{found so}} many bodies that the <b>embalming</b> {{supplies}} aboard were quickly exhausted. Health regulations permitted that only embalmed bodies could {{be returned to}} port. Captain Larnder of the Mackay-Bennett and the undertakers aboard decided to preserve all bodies of First Class passengers {{because of the need}} to visually identify wealthy men to resolve any disputes over large estates. As a result, the majority of the burials at sea were third class passengers and crew. Larnder himself claimed that as a mariner, he would expect to be buried at sea. However complaints about the burials at sea were made by families and undertakers. Later ships such as Minia found fewer bodies, requiring fewer <b>embalming</b> supplies, and were able to limit burials at sea to bodies which were too damaged to preserve.|$|E
5|$|Guanche mummies are the {{intentionally}} desiccated {{remains of}} members of the indigenous Guanche people of the Canary Islands. The majority of Guanche mummies were made during the eras prior to Spanish settlement of the area in the 15th century. The methods of <b>embalming</b> are similar to those that were used by the Ancient Egyptians, though fewer mummies remain from the Guanche due to looting and desecration.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} <b>embalming</b> used by White is unrecorded, but in 1748 {{he had studied}} under the anatomist William Hunter, who had {{developed}} an early system of arterial <b>embalming,</b> therefore {{it is likely that}} White used the same method. The veins and arteries would have been injected with a mixture of turpentine and vermilion, after which the organs would have been removed from the chest and abdomen and placed in water, to clean them and to reduce their bulk. As much blood as possible would then have been squeezed out of the corpse, and the whole body washed with alcohol. The next stage would have been to replace the organs and to repeat the injection of turpentine and vermilion. The body cavities would then have been filled with a mixture of camphor, nitre and resin, before the body was sewn up and all openings filled with camphor. After a final washing, the body would have been packed into a box containing plaster of Paris, to absorb any moisture, and then probably coated with tar, to preserve it.|$|E
50|$|Mummification is {{the drying}} of bodies to {{preserve}} them. The most famous practitioners were ancient Egyptians—many nobles and highly ranked bureaucrats had their corpses <b>embalmed</b> {{and stored in}} luxurious sarcophagi inside their funeral mausoleums. Pharaohs stored their <b>embalmed</b> corpses in pyramids.|$|R
40|$|Purpose:Extraction and {{successful}} PCR amplification of DNA from humanremains in historical and forensic cases have great importance. The {{purpose of this}} study is to demonstrate the efficiency of a method of DNA extraction and PCR amplification of <b>embalmed</b> dried human cadaveric skeletal fragments and teeth specimens from Sokoto, Northwestern Nigeria. Materials and Methods: The efficiency of a method of DNA extraction and PCR amplification was tested on thirteen (13) <b>embalmed</b> dried human cadaveric skeletal fragments and nine (9) teeth specimens from Sokoto, Northwestern Nigeria were used in the study. Results: Of the 13 <b>embalmed</b> dried human cadaveric skeletal fragments, 12 (92. 3 %) samples amplified with apparent bands. For the 9 <b>embalmed</b> dried human teeth specimens, 7 (78 %) samples amplified with apparent bands. Conclusion: The study has shown that our method of DNA extraction and PCR amplification was efficient on <b>embalmed</b> dried human cadaveric skeletal fragments and teeth specimens, from Sokoto, Northwestern Nigeria.

5|$|The {{method of}} <b>embalming</b> was not recorded, but it {{probably}} involved replacing the blood {{with a mixture of}} turpentine and vermilion. The body was then put in an old clock case and stored in the house of Beswick's family physician, Dr Charles White. Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a local celebrity, and visitors were allowed to view her at White's house.|$|E
5|$|Despite its name, the Valley of the Kings also {{contains}} the tombs of favorite nobles {{as well as}} the wives and children of both nobles and pharaohs. Therefore, only about 20 of the tombs actually contain the remains of kings. The remains of nobles and of the royal family, together with unmarked pits and <b>embalming</b> caches, make up the rest. Around the time of Ramesses I (ca. 1301 BC) construction commenced in the separate Valley of the Queens.|$|E
5|$|José de San Martín died on 17 August 1850, in {{his house}} at Boulogne-sur-Mer, France. Between 1850 and 1861, his corpse {{was buried in the}} crypt of the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Boulogne. He {{requested}} in his will to be taken to the cemetery without any funeral, and to be moved to Buenos Aires thereafter. Balcarce informed Rosas and the foreign minister Felipe Arana of San Martín's death. Balcarce oversaw the <b>embalming</b> of his remains and their temporary stay in a chapel of the city. He also sent San Martin's saber to Rosas.|$|E

5|$|Kościuszko's {{internal}} organs, {{which had}} been removed during <b>embalming,</b> were separately interred in a graveyard at Zuchwil, near Solothurn. Kościuszko's organs remain there to this day; a large memorial stone was erected in 1820, next to a Polish memorial chapel. His heart, however, was not interred with the other organs, but instead kept in an urn at the Polish Museum in Rapperswil, Switzerland. The heart, {{along with the rest}} of the Museum's holdings, were repatriated back to Warsaw in 1927, where the heart now reposes in a chapel at the Royal Castle.|$|E
5|$|The goddesses {{find and}} restore Osiris's body, {{often with the}} help of other deities, {{including}} Thoth, a deity credited with great magical and healing powers, and Anubis, the god of <b>embalming</b> and funerary rites. Osiris becomes the first mummy, and the gods' efforts to restore his body are the mythological basis for Egyptian <b>embalming</b> practices, which sought to prevent and reverse the decay that follows death. This part of the story is often extended with episodes in which Set or his followers try to damage the corpse, and Isis and her allies must protect it. Once Osiris is made whole, Isis conceives his son and rightful heir, Horus. One ambiguous spell in the Coffin Texts may indicate that Isis is impregnated by a flash of lightning, while in other sources, Isis, still in bird form, fans breath and life into Osiris's body with her wings and copulates with him. Osiris's revival is apparently not permanent, and after this point in the story he is only mentioned as the ruler of the Duat, the distant and mysterious realm of the dead. Although he lives on only in the Duat, he and the kingship he stands for will, in a sense, be reborn in his son.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} coffin of Thutmose I {{was taken}} over and re-used by a later pharaoh of the 21st dynasty. The mummy of Thutmose I {{was thought to be}} lost, but Egyptologist Gaston Maspero, largely on the strength of familial resemblance to the mummies of Thutmose II and Thutmose III, believed he had found his mummy in the otherwise unlabelled mummy #5283. This identification has been supported by subsequent examinations, revealing that the <b>embalming</b> techniques used came from the appropriate period of time, almost certainly after that of Ahmose I and made {{during the course of the}} Eighteenth dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Cabaniss' {{body was}} ordered to be embalmed but was not; the damage to his body was so severe that the <b>embalming</b> fluid would leak out. His body was buried in Kobe on February 24 with {{military}} honors. The entire crew of the Swatara attended, {{as well as the}} entire crew of HMS Flying Fish and many noted Japanese citizens. Ensign Parker reportedly suffered from depression following the accident. Cabaniss' death received significant media coverage in the Eastern United States. The New York Times published an article on its second page, and among other papers that carried the story were the Wilmington Morning Star and the Petersburg Index-Appeal.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Dr. Don Gregorio Chil y Naranjo {{discovered}} several incisions in some mummies that he speculated {{may have}} been used to remove the internal organs. Don Brothwell's work in 1969 confirmed that evisceration was a method used by the Guanche. Along with a team of other scientists, Brothwell conducted a pathological examination of a Guanche mummy. The examination revealed that the body had been eviscerated, then the abdominal and thoracic cavities had been packed with a mud-like substance that contained the bark of a pine tree. Some sort of packing was also applied subcutaneously, but the exact make-up of this particular <b>embalming</b> substance is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the sinking, several ships sailed to the disaster area to recover victims' bodies. The White Star Line chartered the cable ship Mackay-Bennett from Halifax, Nova Scotia to retrieve bodies. Three other ships followed in the search: the cable ship Minia, the lighthouse supply ship Montmagny and the sealing vessel Algerine. Each ship left with <b>embalming</b> supplies, undertakers, and clergy. Upon recovery, each body retrieved by the Mackay-Bennett was numbered and given as detailed a description as possible to help aid in identification. The physical appearance of each body—height, weight, age, hair and eye colour, visible birthmarks, scars or tattoos, was catalogued and any personal effects on the bodies were gathered and placed in small canvas bags corresponding to their number.|$|E

5|$|Mary's {{request to}} be buried in France was refused by Elizabeth. Her body was embalmed and left unburied in a secure lead coffin until her burial, in a Protestant service, at Peterborough Cathedral in late July 1587. Her entrails, removed as part of the <b>embalming</b> process, were buried {{secretly}} within Fotheringhay Castle. Her body was exhumed in 1612 when her son, King James VI and I, ordered that she be reinterred in Westminster Abbey, in a chapel opposite the tomb of Elizabeth I. In 1867, her tomb was opened in an attempt to ascertain the resting place of James I; he was ultimately found with Henry VII, but many of her other descendants, including Elizabeth of Bohemia, Prince Rupert of the Rhine and the children of Anne, Queen of Great Britain, were interred in her vault.|$|E
5|$|On 8 January 1536, news of Catherine of Aragon's death {{reached the}} King and Anne, who were overjoyed. The {{following}} day, Henry and Anne wore yellow, {{the symbol of}} joy and celebration in England, from head to toe, and celebrated Catherine's death with festivities. In Spain, the home country of Catherine of Aragon, yellow was the colour of mourning, in addition to black. For this reason, the wearing of yellow by Henry and Anne {{may have been a}} symbol of mourning. With Mary's mother dead, Anne attempted to make peace with her. Mary rebuffed Anne's overtures, perhaps because of rumours circulating that Catherine had been poisoned by Anne or Henry. These began after the discovery during her <b>embalming</b> that her heart was blackened. Modern medical experts are in agreement that this was not the result of poisoning, but of cancer of the heart, something which was not understood at the time.|$|E
