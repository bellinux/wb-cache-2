500|$|The game's {{creative}} process is fluid and loosely structured. [...] According to Johnson, [...] "At this point, I provide the overall direction. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> {{a quarter of}} the writing, {{a quarter of the}} coding, and almost all of the artwork." [...] The bulk of the writing is done by Nite, who also contributes design ideas, while two other developers, known in the game as Riff and HotStuff, work on writing, design, and coding.|$|E
500|$|Adamle was {{eligible}} {{to play for}} the Buckeyes again in 1947, but decided to leave school and join the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Adamle had been selected with the 105th pick in the 1947 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears, and he told Cleveland head coach Paul Brown, who coached Ohio State's varsity team between 1941 and 1943, that he would join the Bears if the Browns did not sign him. [...] "I would be a pretty sick fellow today, knowing what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> Tony, if George Halas had gotten him," [...] Brown said before the season began.|$|E
500|$|New Seasons {{met with}} WNA {{and offered to}} {{reproduce}} the painting, either {{on the east side}} of the Red Fox Vintage building or the west side of the planned grocery store. Luening said the latter option was more practical, because the artist could paint on panels in her studio instead of working outside. New Seasons hired Dan Cohen of Dan Cohen Creative Labs to duplicate the mural using a method similar to one he uses in his work as a [...] "mega mural" [...] painter. He said of the process: I paint giant advertising murals all over the country. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> one mural a month. We create the pattern using the original image, and paint on top of it. We use a special machine [...] that works like an arc welder.|$|E

500|$|Lincoln's reply {{would become}} famous, {{much more so}} than the prayer that {{provoked}} it. [...] "My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> slavery, and the colored race, I do because it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union." [...] Lincoln's statement angered abolitionists; William Seward's wife Frances complained to her husband that Lincoln had made it seem [...] "that the mere keeping together a number of states is more important than human freedom." [...] Greeley felt Lincoln had not truly answered him, [...] "but I'll forgive him everything if he'll issue the proclamation". When Lincoln did, on September 22, Greeley hailed the Emancipation Proclamation as a [...] "great boon of freedom". According to Williams, [...] "Lincoln's war for Union was now also Greeley's war for emancipation." ...|$|E
500|$|Arsenal played league challengers Newcastle United in {{the sixth}} round, on 9 March 2002. The timing of the game, {{influenced}} by the television schedulers, angered Wenger, who threatened to field a weakened side, to prioritise on their Champions League progress: [...] "The BBC have put us in this position of playing at 5.35pm on Saturday night instead of a noon kick-off. I don't know whether Newcastle would have played the game earlier on the Saturday but what can <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> the BBC? I feel it's being very unfair as {{we are the only}} side left in all three competitions." [...] It was the second meeting between both teams in a week, and in spite of Arsenal winning the first fixture and scoring the opener in the cup tie, Newcastle found [...] "new reserves of energy and determination" [...] to draw level and created numerous opportunities to win the game outright. With the game ending in a draw, a replay was scheduled two weeks later. Arsenal won 3-0, but more concerningly lost Pirès, who was carried off and subsequently ruled out {{for the remainder of the}} season with medial knee ligament damage. An own goal by Middlesbrough's Gianluca Festa, from an Henry free-kick in the semi-finals was enough to send Arsenal to their 15th FA Cup final.|$|E
2500|$|It was Buñuel's {{intention}} to shock and insult the intellectual bourgeoisie of his youth, later saying: [...] "Historically the film represents a violent reaction against what {{in those days}} was called 'avant-garde,' which was aimed exclusively at artistic sensibility and the audience's reason." [...] Against his hopes and expectations, the film was a huge success amongst the French bourgeoisie, leading Buñuel to exclaim in exasperation, [...] "What can <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> the people who adore all that is new, even when it goes against their deepest convictions, or about the insincere, corrupt press, and the inane herd that saw beauty or poetry in something which was basically no more than a desperate impassioned call for murder?" ...|$|E

2500|$|A January 24 {{debate at}} Florida Atlantic University was sedate, {{with none of}} the {{candidates}} attacking each other and economics the predominant theme. By the next day, however, McCain and Romney were going at each other, with McCain accusing Romney of having once advocated timetables for withdrawal from Iraq, and Romney saying that was untrue — an assessment shared by news organizations, which labeled McCain's charge as misleading—and demanding an apology. Certain statements dogged McCain. NBC News' Tim Russert during a debate raised a McCain quote in which McCain said, [...] "I know a lot less about economics than <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> military and foreign policy issues. I still need to be educated." ...|$|E
