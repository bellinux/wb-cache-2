Should he have screamed out to any chance passenger, it were a curious interruption to a night journey to be hailed {{from the top of}} such a gallows as that. Hark, methinks I do hear his groans amid the whistling of the wind and the creaking of the chains. So--fair and softly; make fast the boat with the grappling, and get out the casket with my matters, we would be better for a little fire, but the light might bring observation on us. Come on, my men of valour, march warily, for we are bound for the <b>gallows</b> <b>foot.</b> Follow with the lantern; I trust the ladder has been left.|$|E

"Your {{speech is}} fair, father, I grant you," [...] said the glover; [...] "but if I am {{to judge the}} {{doctrine}} by the fruits, Heaven has punished me by {{the hand of the}} church for having hearkened thereto. Ere I heard you, my confessor was little moved though I might have owned to have told a merry tale upon the ale bench, even if a friar or a nun were the subject. If at a time I had called Father Hubert a better hunter of hares than of souls, I confessed me to the Vicar Vinesauf, who laughed and made me pay a reckoning for penance; or if I had said that the Vicar Vinesauf was more constant to his cup than to his breviary, I confessed me to Father Hubert, and a new hawking glove made all well again; and thus I, my conscience, and Mother Church lived together on terms of peace, friendship, and mutual forbearance. But since I have listened to you, Father Clement, this goodly union is broke to pieces, and nothing is thundered in my ear but purgatory in the next world and fire and fagot in this. Therefore, avoid you, Father Clement, or speak to those who can understand your doctrine. I have no heart to be a martyr: I have never in my whole life had courage enough so much as to snuff a candle with my fingers; and, to speak the truth, I am minded to go back to Perth, sue out my pardon in the spiritual court, carry my fagot to the <b>gallows</b> <b>foot</b> in token of recantation, and purchase myself once more the name of a good Catholic, were it at the price of all the worldly wealth that remains to me." ...|$|E
50|$|This song is an {{allusion to}} Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West. The opening theme is {{identical}} to the tune played by Harmonica. Furthermore, the German release of the film is titled Spiel mir das Lied vom Tod.The video also features the members of Apocalyptica throughout the video playing their cellos. Meanwhile, the band then plays on gallows, complete with nooses, a tie-in with the title. Later in the video, at about 2:55, for a split second, you can see Dero, Flux, and Crap, hanging from the three noose on the <b>gallows,</b> <b>feet</b> off the ground.|$|R
50|$|In 1778, Fitzpatrick {{was finally}} {{captured}} and, {{after a number}} of escape attempts from prison, he was hanged on September 26 of that year. Reportedly, the rope used to hang him was too long, such that when he fell from the <b>gallows,</b> his <b>feet</b> touched the ground. The hangman then climbed onto Fitzpatrick's shoulders to force him down, so he was actually strangled.|$|R

[par. 138] Clarendon, {{sentence}} on Montrose:--That he was ... to {{be carried}} to Edinburgh Cross, and there to be hanged upon a <b>gallows</b> thirty <b>foot</b> high, for the space of three hours, etc.--Swift.

50|$|In the {{subsequent}} English invasion of Scotland in 1306, {{he was taken}} prisoner at the Battle of Methven. John, Earl of Atholl, was hanged in London, Middlesex, England on 7 November 1306, on a <b>gallows</b> 30 <b>feet</b> higher than ordinary. This was to signify his higher status than his fellow prisoners, no earl had been executed in England for 230 years. His body was burnt and his head fixed on London Bridge.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well! Some whisper this, some whisper that; {{they speak}} of nothing else; even the {{fountain}} appears to fall to that tune. At length, on Sunday night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street. Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by the fountain, there is raised a <b>gallows</b> forty <b>feet</b> high, poisoning the water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A dumb generation--their voice only an inarticulate cry. Spokesman, in the king's council, in the world's forum, {{they have}} none that finds credence. At rare {{intervals}} (as now, in 1775) they will fling down their hoes, and hammers; and, to the astonishment of mankind, flock hither and thither, dangerous, aimless, get the length even of Versailles. Turgot is altering the corn trade, abrogating the absurdest corn laws; there is dearth, real, or were it even factitious, an indubitable scarcity of broad. And so, on the 2nd day of May, 1775, these waste multitudes do here, at Versailles chateau, in widespread wretchedness, in sallow faces, squalor, winged raggedness, present as in legible hieroglyphic writing their petition of grievances. The chateau-gates must be shut; but the king {{will appear on}} the balcony and speak to them. They have seen the king's face; their petition of grievances has been, if not read, looked at. In answer, two of them are hanged, on a new <b>gallows</b> forty <b>feet</b> high, and the rest driven back to their dens for a time." ...|$|R
60|$|There was no hope; the King {{was kept}} in close custody, and Baldock was so ill-treated that he died shortly after. Hugh le Despenser would eat no food after he was taken; and, lest death should balk revenge, he was at once brought to a sham trial, and accused of every misfortune that had befallen England--of the loss of Bannockburn; of {{conspiracy}} against the Queen; of counselling the death of Lancaster; and of suppressing the miracles at his tomb. For all which deeds Sir Hugh le Despenser was sentenced to die as a wicked and attainted traitor; and immediately after {{he was drawn to}} execution in a black gown, with his scutcheon reversed, and a wreath of nettles around his head--but, happily, nearly insensible from exhaustion--and was hanged on a <b>gallows</b> fifty <b>feet</b> high. His son Hugh, a spirited young man of nineteen, held out Caerphilli Castle manfully, until he actually obtained a promise of safety, and lived to transmit the honors of the oldest barony now existing in England.|$|R
60|$|Such things were, {{such things}} are; {{and they go}} on in silence peaceably: and Sansculottisms follow them. History, looking back over this France through long times, back to Turgot's time for instance, when dumb Drudgery {{staggered}} up to its King's Palace, and in wide expanse of sallow faces, squalor and winged raggedness, presented hieroglyphically its Petition of Grievances; and for answer got hanged on a 'new <b>gallows</b> forty <b>feet</b> high,'--confesses mournfully {{that there is no}} period to be met with, in which the general Twenty-five Millions of France suffered less than in this period which they name Reign of Terror! But it was not the Dumb Millions that suffered here; it was the Speaking Thousands, and Hundreds, and Units; who shrieked and published, and made the world ring with their wail, as they could and should: that is the grand peculiarity. The frightfullest Births of Time are never the loud-speaking ones, for these soon die; they are the silent ones, which can live from century to century! Anarchy, hateful as Death, is abhorrent to the whole nature of man; and must itself soon die.|$|R
6000|$|Their King {{has become}} a King Popinjay; with his Maurepas Government, gyrating as the weather-cock does, blown about by every wind. Above them they see no God; or they even do not look above, except with astronomical glasses. The Church indeed still is; but in the most {{submissive}} state; quite tamed by Philosophism; in a singularly short time; for the hour was come. Some twenty years ago, your Archbishop Beaumont would not even let the poor Jansenists get buried: your Lomenie Brienne (a rising man, whom we shall meet with yet) could, {{in the name of}} the Clergy, insist on having the Anti-protestant laws, which condemn to death for preaching, 'put in execution.' (Boissy d'Anglas, Vie de Malesherbes, i. 15-22.) And, alas, now not so much as Baron Holbach's Atheism can be burnt,--except as pipe-matches by the private speculative individual. Our Church stands haltered, dumb, like a dumb ox; lowing only for provender (of tithes); content if it can have that; or, dumbly, dully expecting its further doom. And the Twenty Millions of 'haggard faces;' and, as finger-post and guidance to them in their dark struggle, 'a <b>gallows</b> forty <b>feet</b> high'! Certainly a singular Golden Age; with its Feasts of Morals, its 'sweet manners,' its sweet institutions (institutions douces); betokening nothing but peace among men!--Peace? O Philosophe-Sentimentalism, what hast thou to do with peace, when thy mother's name is Jezebel? Foul Product of still fouler Corruption, thou with the corruption art doomed! ...|$|R
60|$|The King, {{with his}} two favourites, fled to Bristol, where he left old Despenser {{in charge of the}} town and castle, while he went on with the son to Wales. The Bristol men being opposed to the King, and it being {{impossible}} to hold the town with enemies everywhere within the walls, Despenser yielded it up on the third day, and was instantly brought to trial for having traitorously influenced what was called 'the King's mind'--though I doubt if the King ever had any. He was a venerable old man, upwards of ninety years of age, but his age gained no respect or mercy. He was hanged, torn open while he was yet alive, cut up into pieces, and thrown to the dogs. His son was soon taken, tried at Hereford before the same judge on a long series of foolish charges, found guilty, and hanged upon a <b>gallows</b> fifty <b>feet</b> high, with a chaplet of nettles round his head. His poor old father and he were innocent enough of any worse crimes than the crime of having been friends of a King, on whom, as a mere man, they would never have deigned to cast a favourable look. It is a bad crime, I know, and leads to worse; but, many lords and gentlemen--I even think some ladies, too, if I recollect right--have committed it in England, who have neither been given to the dogs, nor hanged up fifty feet high.|$|R
60|$|Dreary, languid {{do these}} {{struggle}} in their obscure remoteness; their hearth cheerless, their diet thin. For them, in this world, rises no Era of Hope; hardly {{now in the}} other,--if it be not hope in the gloomy rest of Death, for their faith too is failing. Untaught, uncomforted, unfed! A dumb generation; their voice only an inarticulate cry: spokesman, in the King's Council, in the world's forum, they have none that finds credence. At rare intervals (as now, in 1775), they will fling down their hoes and hammers; and, to the astonishment of thinking mankind, (Lacretelle, France pendant le 18me Siecle, ii. 455. Biographie Universelle, para Turgot (by Durozoir).) flock hither and thither, dangerous, aimless; get the length even of Versailles. Turgot is altering the Corn-trade, abrogating the absurdest Corn-laws; there is dearth, real, or were it even 'factitious;' an indubitable scarcity of bread. And so, {{on the second day}} of May 1775, these waste multitudes do here, at Versailles Chateau, in wide-spread wretchedness, in sallow faces, squalor, winged raggedness, present, as in legible hieroglyphic writing, their Petition of Grievances. The Chateau gates have to be shut; but the King will appear on the balcony, and speak to them. They have seen the King's face; their Petition of Grievances has been, if not read, looked at. For answer, two of them are hanged, 'on a new <b>gallows</b> forty <b>feet</b> high;' and the rest driven back to their dens,--for a time.|$|R
6000|$|The Scottish Parliament did {{not know}} Oliver yet; so, on hearing of the King's execution, it proclaimed the Prince of Wales King Charles the Second, on {{condition}} of his respecting the Solemn League and Covenant. Charles was abroad at that time, and so was Montrose, from whose help he had hopes enough to keep him holding on and off with commissioners from Scotland, just as his father might have done. These hopes were soon at an end; for, Montrose, having raised a few hundred exiles in Germany, and landed with them in Scotland, found that the people there, instead of joining him, deserted the country at his approach. He was soon taken prisoner and carried to Edinburgh. There he was received with every possible insult, and carried to prison in a cart, his officers going two and two before him. He was sentenced by the Parliament to be hanged on a <b>gallows</b> thirty <b>feet</b> high, to have his head set on a spike in Edinburgh, and his limbs distributed in other places, according to the old barbarous manner. He said he had always acted under the Royal orders, and only wished he had limbs enough to be distributed through Christendom, {{that it might be}} the more widely known how loyal he had been. He went to the scaffold in a bright and brilliant dress, and made a bold end at thirty- eight years of age. The breath was scarcely out of his body when Charles abandoned his memory, and denied that he had ever given him orders to rise in his behalf. O the family failing was strong in that Charles then! ...|$|R
