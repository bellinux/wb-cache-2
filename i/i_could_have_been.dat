500|$|In an {{interview}} for MTV upon the album's release, Big Boi explained that most of its material had been finished while at Jive, stating [...] "It's basically the same album. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> done, like, a year ago. But being that we were having creative differences — you know, every time they rejected what I was doing, I would {{go back in the}} studio and work on more stuff. The last two songs, 'You Ain't No DJ' and 'Be Still,' were the last two records, but everything else was already on there". Despite his individual release, OutKast as a group remained signed to Jive. After leaving Jive, Big Boi contacted record executive and Island Def Jam CEO/chairman L.A. Reid, who had originally signed OutKast to LaFace in 1992. He played Reid a track from the album, [...] "Fo Yo Sorrows", which persuaded him to actualize a contract for Big Boi. Following two months of negotiations, Big Boi signed a three-album deal with Def Jam Recordings in March 2010.|$|E
500|$|Betty Driver, who {{had been}} {{performing}} since she was 8 years old, retired from acting in her late forties to run hotels in Cheshire and Derbyshire. It was here that she was spotted by one of her customers, producer of Coronation Street, Harry Kershaw, who persuaded her to audition {{for the role of}} Hilda Ogden in 1964; she eventually had to turn the role down as she was tied into an advertising contract with Procter & Gamble and they refused to release her. The part of Hilda eventually went to Jean Alexander. Driver has commented, [...] "Harry Kershaw, producer of Coronation Street, persuaded me to audition for Hilda Ogden – just think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> wearing curlers for 30 years." [...] In 1969, she was cast as the new character, Betty Turpin. Commenting on her casting in 1999, Driver said, [...] " [...] said, 'Betty, {{how would you like to}} pull pints for us on television?', and that was it. I suppose I expected I'd be there for perhaps a few months. But it just went on and on and, well, they've never managed to get rid of me." ...|$|E

Content, we felt, was of less importance than a snappy Radio Times billing. In {{the course of our}} historic meeting we had, I imagine, some fine reasons for dismissing the idea of a Festive 40 and going instead for a Festive 50, a decision that was to ruin my Decembers for years to come, condemning me to night after night at home with a ledger, when <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> out and about having fun, fun, fun." ...|$|E

Dickens later used the prison as a setting in Little Dorrit. To pay for his board and to help his family, Dickens was forced to leave school and work ten-hour days at Warren's Blacking Warehouse, on Hungerford Stairs, near the present Charing Cross railway station, where he earned six shillings a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking. The strenuous and often harsh working {{conditions}} made a lasting impression on Dickens and later influenced his fiction and essays, becoming the foundation of his interest in the reform of socio-economic and labour conditions, the rigours of which he believed were unfairly borne by the poor. He later wrote that he wondered [...] "how <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> so easily cast away at such an age".

2500|$|Flutie gained {{national}} attention in 1984 {{when he led}} the Eagles to victory in a high-scoring, back-and-forth game against the Miami Hurricanes (led by QB Bernie Kosar). The game was nationally televised on CBS the day after Thanksgiving and thus had a huge audience. Miami staged a dramatic drive to take the lead, 45–41, in the closing minute of the game. Boston College then took possession at its own 22-yard line with 28 seconds to go. After two passes moved the ball another 30 yards, only 6 seconds remained. On the last play of the game, Flutie scrambled away from the defense and threw a [...] "Hail Mary pass" [...] that {{was caught in the}} end zone by Gerard Phelan, giving BC a 47–45 win.

2500|$|Referred to as a [...] "stoner rap" [...] by Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{the lyrics}} are mostly nonsensical. The song's chorus, in which Beck sings the lines [...] "Soy un perdedor/I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?", is often {{interpreted}} as a parody of Generation X's [...] "slacker" [...] culture. Beck has denied the validity of this meaning, instead saying that the chorus is simply about his lack of skill as a rapper. Jon Pareles wrote in The New York Times that [...] "The sentiment of 'Loser' [...] reflects the twentysomething trademark, a mixture of self-mockery and sardonic defiance", noting Beck's [...] "offhand vocal tone and free-associative lyrics" [...] and comparing his vocals to [...] "Bob Dylan talk-singing". After its recording, Beck thought that the song was interesting but unimpressive. He later said, [...] "The raps and vocals are all first takes. If I’d known the impact {{it was going to}} make, I would have put something a little more substantial in it." [...] The relationship between Beck and Stephenson soured after the release of [...] "Loser" [...] as a single. Stephenson regretted his involvement in creating the song, in particular the [...] "negative" [...] lyrics, saying [...] "I feel bad about it. It's not Beck the person, it's the words.

2500|$|The infamous {{exchange}} between McCartney and Harrison occurred on Monday, January 6. Around lunchtime on Friday, January 10, tensions {{came to a}} head and Harrison told the others that he was leaving the band. [...] This entire episode is omitted from the film. He later recalled: [...] "I thought, 'I'm quite capable of being happy on my own, and if I'm not able to be happy in this situation I'm getting out of here.' So I got my guitar and went home and that afternoon wrote 'Wah-Wah'." [...] Rehearsals and filming continued for a few more sessions; the finished film only used a small amount of footage from this period, namely a boogie-woogie piano duet by McCartney and Starr, although it was included in a way such that Harrison's absence was not apparent. [...] While he was gone, the others considered replacing him with guitarist Eric Clapton, an idea that particularly appealed to Lennon, who was captured on tape saying that if: [...] "George doesn’t come back by Monday or Tuesday, we ask Eric Clapton to play”, and that this would be congenial to Clapton in that the Beatles, unlike Clapton's previous band Cream, “would give him full scope to play his guitar.” [...] Years later, Clapton commented on the absurdity of this idea: “There may have been [...] The problem with that was I had bonded or was developing a relationship with George, exclusive of them. I think it fitted a need of his and mine, that he could elevate himself by having this guy that could be like a gunslinger to them. Lennon would use my name every now and then for clout, as if I was the fastest gun. So, I don’t think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> brought into the whole thing because I was too much a mate of George’s.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the review}} {{aggregator}} Metacritic, the film {{had an average}} score of 25 out of 100, based on 32 reviews from professional critics. At Rotten Tomatoes, 22% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 122 reviews. The film earned generally negative reviews from movie critics, although some praised Lopez's performance. Stephen Holden of The New York Times said Lopez [...] "holds the screen in a star performance that {{has less to do}} with acting than with embodying a forceful, streetwise woman who stands up for herself", while commenting that its preview had [...] "audience gasping" [...] and [...] "Enough does a better job than most movies of sustaining a mood of palpable physical menace, then confirming your worst fears". On the other hand, Alice King of Entertainment Weekly described the film's plot as [...] "arduously nonsensical" [...] and felt that Lopez lacked connection with her on-screen daughter Tessa Allen, commenting that: [...] "All this to protect a helium-voiced little girl with whom Lopez has so little chemistry, it's as if she's handling garbage rather than a small child." [...] A writer from Contactmusic.com was underwhelmed with the development of the film, noting that the film doesn't [...] "utilize Slim's old friend and romantic interest enough, nor does it develop Slim's real and adopted fathers" [...] while it [...] "uses the tiresome old [...] "kid" [...] cliché. Gracie is, as always, just old enough to understand the situation, but not quite old enough to make an actual impact in the story." [...] However, the writer did praise Lopez in the end sequence, [...] "By the final scenes, despite their obviousness, I was as engrossed in the movie as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> actually rooting for J. Lo to kick some bad guy butt". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: [...] "Lopez has an image of being sexy and tough, but her appeal as an actress is that she's down to earth and that her emotions are accessible. There's nothing cold about her." [...] Additionally, LaSalle felt that [...] "It's the most tension-producing movie out there right now", stating that [...] "it has the biggest visceral kick, capable of inspiring blood lust in otherwise peaceful viewers.|$|E
