Each flower, in size like a small coffee-cup, would open out in a white mass and shed its scores of silvery balls, and these when freed of heavy seed would float aloft in the wind, and the whole air as far as one could see would be filled with {{millions}} and myriads of floating balls. The fallen seed was so abundant as to cover the ground under the dead but still standing plants. It is a long, slender seed, {{about the size of}} a grain of Carolina rice, of a greenish or bluish-grey colour, spotted with black. The sheep feasted on it, using their mobile and extensible upper lips like a crumb-brush to gather it into their mouths. Horses gathered it in the same way, but the cattle were out of it, either because they could not learn the trick, or because their lips and tongues cannot be used to gather a crumb-like food. Pigs, however, flourished on it, and to birds, domestic and wild, it was even more than to the mammals.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperatures}} on cold acclimation and deacclimation in foliage tissues was studied in Solanum commersonii (Oka 4583), a tuber-bearing potato. The threshold temperature for cold acclimation was about 12 C. In a temperature range of 2 to 12 C, {{the increase in}} hardiness was dependent on the acclimating temperature; the lower the acclimating temperature, the more hardiness achieved. A day/night temperature of 2 C, regardless of photoperiod, appeared to the optimum acclimating temperature for the Solanum species studied. A subfreezing temperature <b>hardened</b> <b>plants</b> less effectively. The maximum level of hardiness could be reached after 15 days of cold acclimation.

40|$|Eucalyptus globulus Labill {{is one of}} {{the most}} planted species in Chile, because of its fast growth and {{superior}} pulp qualities. Nevertheless, the incidence of drought and frost damage immediately after planting is frequent. The purpose of this work was to study the effect of drought hardening on frost resistance and on variations in morphological traits that may increase drought resistance at nursery phase in four genotypes of E. globulus Labill. Drought hardening treatments consisted in induced water stress by watering restriction, until pre-dawn stem xylem water potentials (&# 936;pd) reached - 0. 2, - 1. 8 and - 2. 6 MPa. Two water stress-rewatering cycles were applied during 54 days of <b>hardening.</b> <b>Plant</b> and root biomasses were affected by the interaction of drought hardening and genotypes. The rest of morphological and alometrical traits were affected independently by drought or genotype. Plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA), stem, and leaf biomasses decreased with drought hardening, while collar diameter was not affected. Genotypes responded differentially to drought hardening in plant height, leaf area, SLA, and stem, and leaf biomasses. Ice nucleation temperature (INT), and freezing temperatures (FRT), and 50 % freezing damage index of leaves (LT 50) were affected by the interaction between drought hardening and genotypes. EG- 13, EG- 23 and EG- 22 genotypes became freezing tolerant with drought hardening (- 2. 6 MPa). Additionally, EG- 14 genotype increased its freezing resistance at - 1. 8 MPa. Therefore, freezing resistance levels and mechanism depend on genotype and drought hardening treatment. The success in tree breeding by genetic selection should be facilitated by improved understanding of the physiology of stress resistance development and survival during water supply limitations. The knowledge of morphological and freezing resistance dependency on the interaction between genotype and drought hardening may be useful nursery management information to improve plantation success...|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{effects of}} low {{temperature}} (3 °C, 7 days) and the anti-microtubule drug, oryzalin, {{on the content}} and organization of reticuloplasmins (Ca 2 +-binding marker proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum) in winter wheat seedlings were studied. For identification and visualization of reticuloplasmins, one-dimensional SDS-PAGE with subsequent western blotting and indirect fluorescent microscopy were applied. We used polyclonal HSP 70 and CRH antibodies against BiP and calreticulin (Cal), respectively. On immunoblots, the brightest bands corresponded to polypeptides with mol wts of 58 kD (calreticulin) and 79 kD (BiP). The content of calreticulins in roots was shown {{to be higher than}} in leaves. Cold acclimation enhanced the concentration of calreticulins and BiP in cells. Oryzalin (10 µM, treatment for 3 h) did not affect on the level of reticuloplasmins in roots of non-hardened and cold <b>hardened</b> <b>plants.</b> However, both oryzalin and low-temperature treatments resulted in the accumulation of reticuloplasmins in the two spherical structures {{in the vicinity of the}} plasmalemma and nuclear envelope. After the combined action of oryzalin and low temperature, the cortical sphere of BiP proteins was shifted into the endoplasm, and calreticulins appeared in the nuclear matrix. We believe that these changes in reticuloplasmin localization are related to the rearrangement of the endoplasmic reticulum determined by the cytoskeleton modification. They result in the improved capacity of reticuloplasmins to control Ca 2 + behavior and/or to function as chaperones. The results obtained permit the conclusion that cytoskeletal protein...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} {{high frequency}} plant regeneration protocol through direct organogenesis {{was developed for}} Sevia rebaudi-ana Bert. Nodal segments containing axillary buds were used as an explant and inoculated on Murashige and Skoog’s (MS) medium containing 3 % (w/v) sucrose, 0. 8 % (w/v) agar supplemented with various concentrations of benzy-ladenine (BA), kinetin (Kn) and thidiazuron (TDZ) ranging from 1. 00 to 9. 00 µM. Maximum multiple shoots (96 %) were obtained in MS medium supplemented with 1. 0 µM TDZ {{with an average of}} 60 shoots per culture, having an av-erage shoot length of 6. 0 cm. The best in vitro root induction (89 %) was achieved on half strength MS medium without any growth regulator with an average of 24 roots per culture and root length of 7 cm. The rooted plantlets were suc-cessfully established in soil and grown to maturity at the survival rate of 95 % in the indoor grow room. High- perform-ance liquid chromatography was used to assess the stability in chemical profile and quantification of stevioside and re-baudioside A content of in vitro propagated S. rebaudiana plants and compared with their mother plant at the peak vegetative stage. Our results show no significant differences (p < 0. 05) between the mother and in vitro propagated plants. Furthermore, fully developed in vitro propagated S. rebaudiana plants were also compared with mother plant for their gas and water vapour exchange characteristics and leaf anatomy. The results show that in vitro propagated and <b>hardened</b> <b>plants</b> of S. rebaudiana are morphologically as well as functionally comparable {{to each other and to}} thei...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} for developing a high frequency regeneration system in two genotypes of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), �Punjab Upma� and �IPA- 3 � for direct shoot regeneration from hypocotyl explants. The explants were excised from in vitro tomato seedlings and cultured on MS medium supplemented with different concentrations and combinations of hormones. Direct regeneration was significantly influenced by the genotype hormones combination and concentrations. The MS medium supplemented with (Kinetin 0. 5 mg/l) and (BAP 0. 5 mg/l) was found optimum for inducing direct shoot regeneration and number of shoots per explant from hypocotyl explants on this medium. Shoot regeneration per cent in �Punjab Upma� and �IPA- 3 � per cent was recorded to be highest i. e (86. 02) and (82. 57) respectively. Besides this, average number shoots per explant was also highest i. e (3. 16) in case of �Punjab Upma� and (2. 93) in case of �IPA- 3 �. A significant decline was observed in percent shoot regeneration and average number of shoots per explant with increase in the hormonal concentration. Shoots were obtained and transferred to the elongation medium (MS + BAP 0. 3 mg/l). Hundred per cent rooting was induced in separated shoots upon culturing on MS and � MS basal media. Hardening on moist cotton showed maximum plantlet survival rate {{in case of both}} genotypes. After <b>hardening,</b> <b>plants</b> were transferred to soil. Thus, a tissue culture base line was established in tomato for obtaining direct regeneration using hypocotyl as explants...|$|R
