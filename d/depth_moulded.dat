40|$|Abstract. The heat {{penetration}} <b>depth</b> of <b>mould</b> for Semi-solid net-shape forming affects {{not only}} the life of moulds, but also the quality of products. By integral approximate solution of temperature field and analyses of solidification process, a theoretical model of heat penetration depth for semi-solid net-shape forming mould was obtained, and in this model the influence factors such as product material thermal properties, mould material thermal properties and solidification time are given much consideration. Studies show that the heat penetration depth increases exponentially with interface thermal resistance and time respectively, and increase as a cubic curve with pouring temperature and preheating temperature...|$|R

40|$|Injection {{moulding}} of micro-featured {{plastic parts}} {{is becoming more}} and more important for applications of micro system technologies in different fields (IT, healthcare, medicine) due to its capacity to produce low-cost and high repeatable micro polymeric parts. However, approaching the micro world, different issues related to the process should be addressed, especially as the <b>depth</b> of the <b>mould</b> cavity becomes very thin. In particular, the characteristics of mould surface could affect not only the surface quality of micro components, but also the filling of injected parts. This work aims to identify the effect of the superficial texture on the filling capability of thin cavity in micro injection moulding process, and to evaluate the influence when the texture is obtained by different machining processes. The results of the experiments, carried out using a polymeric material, are discussed in the paper and show that, when the surface has an isotropic texture, the filling is proportional to the increase of the surface roughness, whereas an oriented direction of the texture longitudinal to the flow front favours the injection process...|$|R

40|$|In {{temperature}} cycle injection moulding (TCIM) of thermoplastics, the mould cavity surface is heated to a temperature {{close to the}} glass transition point of the resin before melt injection, and then cooled after injection is complete. In order to study the weld line developing process and its influence on surface finish in micro injection moulding, a variotherm system mould was used. The effect of TCIM on mechanical properties {{in the region of}} the weld line is also the subject of the present work. In this mould, a visualization design was integrated. A tensile bar sample and a flat cavity with an obstacle were used for the study of two main types of weld line. The tensile specimens were produced applying different processing parameters. Weld line depth and surface roughness are determined using an atomic force microscope. Weld line strength of micro tensile samples were tested on the micro tensile test machine. Results showed that the shape of weld lines and roughness are mainly influenced by mould temperature and its interaction with the injection speed. It is necessary to increase the temperature to 10 °C higher than Tg to obtain a glossy surface without weld lines. The cooling time of the injected part also affects the weld line <b>depth.</b> Elevated <b>mould</b> temperature and low injection speed were shown to improve weld line strength for each material in the experiment. Weld line strength was shown to be inversely proportional to the impingement velocity. Candidate reasons include air entrainment in the mating surface and superheating of the air compressed air in the region affecting the polymer behavior. The comparison between conventional injection moulding process and TCIM shows how the variotherm system is suitable to be used to improve the mechanical properties and to completely remove the weld lines of plastic parts...|$|R
