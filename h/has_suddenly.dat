5|$|After {{completing}} the game once, the player can access the Chrysler Building and {{have access to}} the final boss, who takes the form of Aya's sister, Maya. She explains to Aya that Klamp cultivated the liver cells of the original Eve to analyze. When Melissa was giving birth to the Ultimate Being, she created a nest there. In case Melissa and the Ultimate Being failed, the purebred would remain. Aya speaks with her sister, and they engage in battle against the purebred. After the purebred is defeated, the mitochondria inside Aya's body begin to rebel against her. It is explained that Aya's mitochondria have now reached a higher evolutionary stage than Maya’s, but Maya's personality <b>has</b> <b>suddenly</b> become dominant and begun to fight off the Eve persona. Maya eventually wins, purging the Eve persona from herself. Somehow, Maya protects Aya by preventing the original Eve from taking over her. Aya leaves the building by herself, although she apparently has gained some sort of connection with her dead sister.|$|E

500|$|A Detroit {{newspaper}} {{wrote that}} Heikkinen was {{the surprise of}} the 1937 season. “Heikkinen has no spectacular record {{as a high school}} player to show. He was a reserve guard last season and really just started to show up in spring practice this year.” The Bessemer Herald reported on the impressive turnaround of the first player from the Gogebic Range to be named All-Big Ten: “Heikkinen, one of the quietest and least boisterous men on the Michigan grid squad, <b>has</b> <b>suddenly</b> shot from obscurity into the Western Conference hall of fame [...] [...] [...] From a lowly bench warmer last year, ‘Hike’ {{became one of the most}} consistent first-stringers this season. He played many if not more minutes than any other member of the squad.” ...|$|E

[...] Blocks fall from the sky and assemble themselves into the character Impie, and the pair's figures distort, disappear, and reappear, before a fantastically-dressed Little Nemo magically materializes. [...] Nemo prevents the two others from fighting and takes control of their forms—he stretches and squashes them with the raising and lowering of his arms. [...] Nemo then draws the Princess and brings her to animated life. [...] He gives her a rose which <b>has</b> <b>suddenly</b> grown nearby, just as a gigantic dragon appears. [...] The pair seat themselves on a throne in the dragon's mouth and wave to the audience as the dragon carries them away.|$|E
500|$|The {{screenplay}} by Donald Ogden Stewart {{is adapted from}} the novel Keeper of the Flame by I. A. R. Wylie. Hepburn plays the widow of a famous civic leader who <b>has</b> <b>suddenly</b> died in an accident, while Tracy portrays a former war correspondent who intends to write a flattering biography of the dead man, {{only to find that}} his death is shrouded in mystery. [...] Screenwriter Stewart considered the script to be the finest moment of his entire career, feeling vindicated by the assignment as he believed that Hollywood had punished him for years for his political views. Principal filming began in the last week of August 1942, four months after the release of the novel, published by Random House. The entire picture was filmed on a sound stage, with no location shooting. Hepburn had already begun her extramarital affair with Tracy, and due to his heavy drinking, she became his constant guardian during filming.|$|E

500|$|... "Son of a Gun" [...] {{was written}} by James Yoshimura based on a story by {{executive}} producer Tom Fontana, and was directed by Nick Gomez. It was the first Homicide: Life on the Street episode written by Yoshimura, who {{would serve as a}} writer and eventually supervising producer throughout the entirety of the series. The episode featured a blending of hard-edged emotion and amusing character comedy, the combination of which would become common in future Yoshimura-penned episodes. It was originally supposed to be the fourth episode of the first season of Homicide: Life on the Street, but was broadcast third when the episode [...] "Night of the Dead Living" [...] was moved {{to the end of the}} season. NBC programmers were worried that the latter episode, which takes place entirely within the detective's squad room, was too deliberately paced for a series still trying to win viewers. However, as a result of the move, the Adena Watson investigation <b>has</b> <b>suddenly</b> advanced far further than it last stood in the previous episode, [...] "." ...|$|E
500|$|Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan {{rated the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] and applauded {{the return of}} Duchovny, writing, [...] "welcome back, [...] you {{magnificent}} bastard." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations wrote a mixed review of the episode. On one hand, he praised {{the feel of the}} episode, writing, [...] "in many ways, this was an episode that brought back the intensity, magic, and the power of The X-Files that I have been missing throughout this most mundane of seasons." [...] In this manner, Kessenich felt that Doggett became [...] "part of The X-Files for the first time." [...] However, Kessenich also felt that the plot involving Mulder's terminal brain disease was a mis-step, noting that Mulder would have never kept something so serious and personal from Scully. He wrote, [...] "a year ago, Mulder was not dying [...] what we once knew as truth <b>has</b> <b>suddenly</b> been replaced with a lie." [...] George Avalos and Michael Liedtke of the Contra Costa Times called the entry [...] "one of the season's more engaging episodes" [...] and wrote positively of the [...] "intriguing possibilities" [...] that it set up for the final part of the season. They were also positive about the manner in which Doggett and Mulder were able to connect in [...] "some mystical way". However, Avalos and Liedtke were critical of the episode's placement, noting that it would have worked better had it been the [...] "fourth or fifth episode of the season", as opposed to the eighth. Furthermore, they negatively wrote about the revelation that Mulder was suffering from a terminal brain disease, calling it a [...] "monumental story" [...] curve that did not bother [...] "to connect all the dots behind" [...] it.|$|E

2500|$|Surgical {{mortality}} due to {{closure of}} an ASD is lowest when {{the procedure is}} performed prior {{to the development of}} significant pulmonary hypertension.
