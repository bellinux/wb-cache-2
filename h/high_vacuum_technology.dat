50|$|For some applications, it {{is useful}} to store beams of high energy {{particles}} for some time (with modern <b>high</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>technology,</b> up to many hours) without further acceleration. This is especially true for colliding beam accelerators, in which two beams moving in opposite directions are made to collide with each other, with a large gain in effective collision energy. Because relatively few collisions occur at each pass through the intersection point of the two beams, it is customary to first accelerate the beams to the desired energy, and then store them in storage rings, which are essentially synchrotron rings of magnets, with no significant RF power for acceleration.|$|E

30|$|Although current {{commercial}} silicon {{solar cells}} can reach 10 – 20 % {{power conversion efficiency}} (PCE), current solar cell manufacturing processes require <b>high</b> temperatures, <b>vacuum</b> <b>technologies,</b> and high-grade materials, all of which increase cost. As a result, current commercial solar cells remain expensive compared to fossil fuels, around 25 – 50 cents per kilowatt hour in the USA [1]. Organic solar cells, which are made from carbon-containing compounds, are usually made in solution {{so that they can}} be produced with low-cost printing or coating techniques. Liquid-phase coating processing can bring down manufacturing costs by avoiding high temperature and <b>high</b> <b>vacuum</b> methods. However, stability and carrier transport are challenges for organic solar cells. Current solar cells are expected to last for 20 – 30 years at temperatures between − 20 and 90 °C, which organic solar cells may not be able to achieve [2]. The highest carrier mobility in polymer-based organic solar cells is typically on the order of 0.1 cm 2 /Vs [3, 4]. Compared to inorganic semiconductors, carrier mobility in organic solar cells is still low.|$|R

40|$|The {{recovery}} of light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) from low permeability glacial soils (silts and clays) can be problematic due to low well yields. The use of <b>high</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>technology</b> (including bioslurping, vacuum enhanced recovery and/or multi-phase extraction) {{has been used}} at these types of sites to improve LNAPL recovery rates in comparison to traditional pump and treat technologies. However, the use of high vacuum alone is limited to recovering LNAPL from relatively shallow depths (typically less than 25 to 30 feet (7. 6 to 9. 1 metres) due to the lift limitations of vacuum technology. This paper examines the {{recovery of}} LNAPL from depths in excess of 30 feet (9. 1 metres) at a large General Motors manufacturing site in eastern Michigan (Site).

40|$|The {{development}} of clean and efficient high vacuum technologies to replace traditional methods for metallic or polymeric surfaces treatments to clean, deposit thin films, and functionalize surfaces, constitutes {{a very important}} area of research. The increasing concern regarding the {{development of}} environmentally friendly and sustainable technologies consists in an important objective in the modern world. In this context, cold plasma technology represents an efficient alternative, which has been object of increasing attention. In this work we evaluate the effect of plasma treatments on the removal of oil from aluminum surfaces. Furthermore, processes of deposition, and fine film activation, were studied on the surface previously cleaned. After a first plasma application to clean the oil contaminated aluminum surface, a thin film of HMDSO was deposited to achieve corrosion protection, and finally the deposited film was functionalized to obtain a surface with a higher energy, to favor adhesion to different polymers. The evaluation of the cleanness efficiency was conducted {{by means of the}} contact angle, and XPS. The nature of deposited and functionalized film was investigated using Fourier Transform Infra Red Spectroscopy (FTIR), angle of contact, and Scanning Electron Microscopy. A very significant reduction in the carbon content of the surfaces, was abserced. An increase in the surface energy of 95, 48 mN/m was obtained. Cleaning, corrosion protection and functionalization utilizing <b>high</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>technology</b> can completely substitute wet processes associated with undesirable high environmental impact.

40|$|Abstract—Both {{electrical}} and optical reliabilities of PMOS and NMOS tunneling diodes are enhanced by oxide roughness, prepared by very <b>high</b> <b>vacuum</b> prebake <b>technology.</b> For the rough PMOS devices, {{as compared to}} the flat PMOS devices, the Weibull plot of shows 2. 5 -fold enhancement at 63 % failure rate, while both the P and P-treated flat PMOS devices show similar inferior reliability. For the rough NMOS devices, {{as compared to the}} flat NMOS devices, the Weibull plot of shows 4. 9 -fold enhancement at 63 % failure rate. The time evolutions of the light emission from the rough PMOS and NMOS diodes degrade much less than those of the flat PMOS and NMOS diodes. The momentum reduction perpendicular to the Si/SiOP interface by roughness scattering could possibly make it difficult to form defects in the bulk oxide and at the Si/SiOP interface by the impact of the energetic electrons and holes.

40|$|Non-equilibrium {{rarefied}} flows are encountered {{frequently in}} supersonic flight at <b>high</b> altitudes, <b>vacuum</b> <b>technology</b> and in microscale devices. Prediction of {{the onset of}} non-equilibrium is important for accurate numerical simulation of such flows. We formulate and apply the discrete version of Boltzmann’s H-theorem for analysis of non-equilibrium onset and accuracy of numerical modeling of rarefied gas flows. The numerical modeling approach {{is based on the}} deterministic solution of kinetic model equations. The numerical solution approach comprises the discrete velocity method in the velocity space and the finite volume method in the physical space with different numerical flux schemes: the first-order, the second-order minmod flux limiter and a third-order WENO schemes. The use of entropy considerations in rarefied flow simulations is illustrated for the normal shock, the Riemann and the two-dimensional shock tube problems. The entropy generation rate based on kinetic theory is shown to be a powerful indicator of the onset of non-equilibrium, accuracy of numerical solution as well as the compatibility of boundary conditions for both steady and unsteady problems...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{originated from}} work by Dr. A. H. McIlraith of the National Physical Laboratory who, in 1966, described {{a new type}} of charged particle oscillator. This makes use of two equal cylindrical electrodes to constrain the particles {{in such a way that}} they follow extremely long oscillatory paths between the electrodes under the influence of an electrostatic field alone. The object of this work has been to study the principle of the oscillator in detail and to investigate its properties and applications. Any device which is capable of creating long electron trajectories has potential application in the field of ultra <b>high</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>technology.</b> It was therefore considered that a critical review of the problems associated with the production and measurement of ultra high vacuum was relevant in the initial stages of the work. The oscillator has been applied with a considerable degree of success as a high energy electrostatic ion source. This offers several advantages over existing ion sources. It can be operated at much lower pressures without the need of a magnetic field. The oscillator principle has also been applied as a thermionic ionization gauge and has been compared with other ionization gauges to pressures as low as 5 x 10 - 11 torr [...] This new gauge exhibited a number of advantages over most of the existing gauges. Finally the oscillator has been used in an evaporation ion pump and has exhibited fairly high pumping speeds for argon gas relative to those for nitrogen. This investigation supports the original work of Dr. A. H. McIlraith and shows that his proposed oscillator has considerable potential in the fields of vacuum technology and electron physics...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{dielectric}} wall accelerator (DWA) {{is a new}} accelerator concept particularly {{suited for}} short pulse ( 1 kA) [1].

Combined with new <b>high</b> gradient <b>vacuum</b> insulator <b>technology,</b> short-pulse-high-gradients of greater than 20 - 30 MV/m may be possible [2, 3]. The asymmetric Blumlein consists of two stacked pulse forming lines of different transit times (i. e., differing permittivities, e r) and ideally, of equal impedances (Fig. 2). When the conductor in common with both lines is charged to potential, V o, and shorted at the end opposite the accelerator beam tube, two reversed polarity wavefronts in each line move at velocities proportional to e r - 0. 5 toward the beam tube.
