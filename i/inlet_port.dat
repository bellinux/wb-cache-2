500|$|In December 2003, his {{traction}} engine {{was now in}} working order and planning for the new series commenced. [...] Dibnah's illness necessitated that he sleep in hotels, rather than the living van the engine would tow during the trip. [...] For the long distances between locations, the engine would be transported {{on the back of}} a low loader. [...] Dibnah's engine suffered early mechanical problems; it could barely tow the fully loaded living van uphill, as the cylinder had been placed very slightly closer to the footplate than it should have been. As a result of this, every time the piston was fully forward it covered the steam <b>inlet</b> <b>port.</b> [...] The engine was repaired, and with some minor engineering work to one of the pistons was brought up to full power. [...] The team was joined by Dibnah's sons, Jack and Roger.|$|E

2500|$|In 1901, the Canadian Pacific Railway {{purchased}} the Canadian Pacific Navigation Company {{and all its}} ships, including Princess Louise. [...] The name of Princess Louise inspired the Canadian Pacific to name {{a new series of}} coastal liners as [...] "Princesses". [...] In 1901, Capt. James W. Troup reported that Princess Louise was in poor mechanical condition, with worn out boilers and engines badly in need of repair. [...] Because the hull was still in good condition, and capable of being operated in the often-dangerous waters of the Strait of Georgia, Troup recommended that the engines be replaced. [...] This however was not done. [...] Even so, the CPR did use Princess Louise in the winter to replace the sternwheeler R.P. Rithet on the route from Victoria to New Westminster and points on the lower Fraser River. [...] In the summers, the Princess Louise was a secondary vessel on northern routes to Rivers <b>Inlet,</b> <b>Port</b> Simpson, British Columbia, and the Queen Charlotte Islands. [...] Ships on this route departed Victoria twice a month, on the 1st and the 15th at 11:00p.m., and stopped in Vancouver the next day on the way north.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rotary engine}} places severe thermal {{stresses}} on its cases, as {{two sides of}} rotor are constantly exposed to high ignition and exhaust temperatures, while the third side inducts cool fuel/air mixture. To cope with this, and probably capitalizing on their previous experience with water cooling, Suzuki opted for a liquid-cooled engine using two separate systems. Oil is used to lubricate and cool the internals of the rotor and water-cooled the external jacketing. Oil is fed from an engine sump by a trochoid pump at around [...] The oil is then circulated through an oil cooler mounted across the frame and below the radiator. A pressure regulator also acts as a bypass {{in case of a}} blockage in the cooler. A centrifugal pump sends coolant around the external rotor jacketing but via an intricate path in an attempt to even out the massive thermal stresses. Liquid enters at the point of highest temperatures (ignition), passing from the right side to the left, and then makes a 180° turn, returning to the right side and passing near the exhaust port. Most of the coolant is then routed to the very large radiator that sits across the frame in front of the bike. Some of the coolant that was not directed to the radiator is now sent around the <b>inlet</b> <b>port</b> and the left side housing. Its passage is once again reversed before flowing to the radiator. [...] The water cooling is thermostatically controlled, and a shrouded fan {{on the right side of}} the radiator takes care of excessive temperatures, switching on at [...] and cutting when the temperature falls below [...]|$|E
2500|$|Metabolic chambers: Chambers may be {{glass jars}} with rubber {{stoppers}} for lids; syringe barrels for small animals and insects; or constructed from Plexiglas. Ideally, chambers should be constructed from inert materials; for example, the acrylic plastics can absorb O2 {{and may be}} a poor choice for respirometry with very small insects. Chambers need to be constructed {{in a manner that}} yields rapid mixing of gases within the chamber. [...] The simplest metabolic chamber for a small vertebrate might be a glass jar with a stopper. [...] The stoppers are fitted with two ports: short extensions of Teflon tubing are provided for line connections. Teflon tube extensions are pushed through the bulkhead and the line connection is finished by attaching a small hose clip {{to the base of the}} Teflon tube extension. Additionally, an extension to the <b>inlet</b> <b>port</b> inside the jar should be provided—this ensures that the animal's expiratory gases are not washed away by the in flow stream. The animal is sealed inside and the rubber stopper is held in place with Velcro straps. If an upstream system is used, any metabolic chamber leak will result in loss of animal air and, therefore, an underestimate of the animal's metabolic rate. When you close an animal inside a metabolic chamber, attention must be paid to the seal. To ensure tight seals before closing the lid, firmly work the stopper into the jar and make sure that it is even. Use 1-2 straps (2 are better) and pull tightly. Acrylic (Plexiglas) chambers will be constructed for some uses, but precise engineering will be needed to ensure proper seating; gaskets will help, and judicious use of tight-fitting clamps will minimize leaks.|$|E

40|$|A new {{chemical}} reactor, the Open Plate Reactor (OPR), {{is being}} developed by Alfa Laval AB. It has a very flexible configuration with distributed <b>inlet</b> <b>ports,</b> cooling zones and internal sensors.

In this paper, we address {{the relationship between the}} process design, the number of actuators used and how to use these actuators in feedback control {{to be able to use}} the full potential of the OPR. The performance of the OPR can be significantly improved by using additional <b>inlet</b> <b>ports</b> and cooling zones.

50|$|Effect of precession. When {{the piston}} {{is at the}} top of the {{reciprocation}} cycle (commonly referred to as top-dead-center or just TDC), the connection between the trapped fluid chamber and the pump's discharge port is closed. Shortly thereafter, that same chamber becomes open to the pump's <b>inlet</b> <b>port.</b> As the piston continues to precess about the cylinder block axis, it moves away from the valve plate thereby increasing the volume of the trapped chamber. As this occurs, fluid enters the chamber from the pump's inlet to fill the void. This process continues until the piston reaches the bottom of the reciprocation cylinder - commonly referred to as bottom-dead-center or BDC. At BDC, the connection between the pumping chamber and <b>inlet</b> <b>port</b> is closed. Shortly thereafter, the chamber becomes open to the discharge port again and the pumping cycle starts over.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to {{study the effects of}} increased area of <b>inlet</b> tangential <b>ports</b> on the performance of small scale simplex atomizer. The spray characteristics of three different simplex atomizer representing varying area of <b>inlet</b> tangential <b>ports</b> are examined using water as a working fluid. Measurements of coefficient of discharge, spray cone angle, Sauter mean diameter and droplet size distribution were carried out over wide range of injection pressure. Coriolis mass flow meter was used to measure coefficient of discharge. Spray cone angle was measured by image processing technique. Sauter mean diameter and droplet size distributions were measured by Malvern droplet sizing instrument. It was observed that with increase in area of <b>inlet</b> tangential <b>ports</b> the size of air core produced along the center line reduced, which increases the coefficient of discharge. Spray cone angle decreases with increase in area of <b>inlet</b> tangential <b>ports</b> reduces swirl strength inside swirl chamber, which results in increasing Sauter mean diameter. Better droplet size distribution was observed for lower area of <b>inlet</b> tangential <b>port</b> configuration. Good agreement was observed between the obtained experimental results and experimental correlations available in literatures. ...|$|R

50|$|Gas, often air, {{is drawn}} into the pump through an <b>inlet</b> <b>port</b> {{in the end of}} the casing.

50|$|The air-fuel mix {{is drawn}} into an engine because {{downward}} {{motion of the}} pistons induces a partial vacuum.
