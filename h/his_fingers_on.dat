5|$|Bolt {{followed}} this {{up with a}} successful defence of his Olympic 200 metres title {{with a time of}} 19.32 seconds, followed by Blake at 19.44 and Warren Weir at 19.84 to complete a Jamaican podium sweep. With this, Bolt became the first man in history to defend both the 100 m and 200 m Olympic sprint titles. He was dramatic in victory: in the final metres of the 200 m race, Bolt placed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> his lips, gesturing to silence his critics, and after crossing the line he completed five push-ups – one for each of his Olympic gold medals.|$|E
5|$|Nemo {{stays with}} his father, who later becomes disabled. He {{works in a}} shop and spends his free time at home at the typewriter, writing a science fiction story about a journey to Mars. At a school dance, he meets Elise and falls in love. A few days later, Nemo goes to Elise's house but sees her with her 22-year-old boyfriend. Frustrated, he speeds away on his motorcycle, has an {{accident}} and is hospitalized in a vegetative state. Though he can perceive the world through his senses, Nemo cannot move or speak. He detects his parents' reunion at his bedside. Nemo tries to remember the movement of <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> the typewriter keyboard and eventually manages to lift a finger as this story line comes to a close.|$|E
5|$|Tired of his high-priced {{imported}} livestock {{losing in}} local shows, Glure concocts a dog {{show with a}} special gold cup event that is limited to collies that are both American Kennel Club blue ribbon winners and capable of completing the tasks of a British working sheep dog trial. Initially, {{it seems like the}} only dog who meets the requirements is Glure's recently purchased blue-merle champion, Lochinvar III; however, the Mistress is able to command Lad through the motions of the trial. Lochinvar works primarily by hand signal, so when Glure accidentally burns <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> his cigar while going through the trial, the dog stops working and waits for Glure's hand-shaking to be explained. The dog is disqualified and Lad is declared the winner. The Master and Mistress donate the gold cup to the Red Cross in his name.|$|E

25|$|It took Thomas {{over two}} weeks to move, causing great anxiety in Washington, where it was {{anticipated}} that Hood was poised for an invasion of the North. General Grant pressured Thomas to move, despite a bitter ice storm that struck on December 8 and stopped much fortification on both sides. A few days later, Grant sent an aide to relieve Thomas of command, believing that Hood would slip through <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> <b>On</b> December 13, Maj. Gen. John A. Logan was directed to proceed to Nashville and assume command if, upon his arrival, Thomas had not yet initiated operations. He made {{it as far as}} Louisville by December 15, but on that day the Battle of Nashville had finally begun.|$|E
500|$|An {{ambulance}} {{arrived at}} the scene in one minute and 55 seconds. The paramedics tore away the green sweater where the bleeding was taking place and applied a Vaseline gauze to Selena's wound, which stopped the surface bleeding. Selena's heartbeat was now very slow; a paramedic performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation to keep her blood circulating. Paramedic Richard Fredrickson said [...] "it was too late" [...] {{when he arrived in}} the lobby. He found a [...] "thick [...] from her neck to her knees, all the way around on both sides [...] ". Fredrickson could not locate a pulse; when he placed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> her neck, he felt only muscle twitches.|$|E
500|$|In 1921, the Commodores hired Wallace Wade as an {{assistant}} and posted an undefeated, 7–0–1 record. [...] "The Texas game, sparked by McGugin's unforgettable oratory, was the big one." [...] "Instead of hammering detailed strategy into them," [...] coach Dan McGugin had taken his team to the nearby grave of former Vanderbilt quarterback Curry in Marlin, Texas. In a noted speech just before the teams took to the field, referring to this grave, McGugin tapped <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> the floor and began: Vanderbilt went on to upset the Longhorns 20–0. Later the same season, Vanderbilt faced Georgia in a contest for the Southern crown, tying the game late on an onside-kick-from-scrimmage 7–7.|$|E

500|$|Once there, he sits {{cross-legged on}} his lily-pad and {{arranges}} his tackle. He has [...] "the dearest little red float". His rod is a stalk {{of grass and}} his line a horsehair. An hour passes without a nibble. He takes a break and lunches on a butterfly sandwich. A water beetle tweaks his toe causing him to withdraw his legs, and rats rustling about in the rushes force him to seek a safer location. He drops his line {{into the water and}} immediately has a bite. It is not a minnow but little Jack Sharp, a stickleback. The fish escapes but not before Jeremy pricks <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> Jack's spines. A shoal of little fishes come to the surface to laugh at Jeremy.|$|E
500|$|On {{her next}} cruise, Independence had smooth sailing for about seven days when on 17 April she {{encountered}} the Mexican brigs-of-war Vencedor del Álamo and Libertador off {{the mouth of}} the Brazos River. The initial sighting of the two Mexican brigs was at about 5:30 am. Outgunned and outmanned, Independence fled up Brazos River for protection at the small riverside town of Velasco. The Mexican vessels pursued the Texans; eventually the two brigs came within cannon range several hours later at 9:30 am. Vincedor del Alamo of sixteen 8-pound guns and 140 men, sailed with Libertador of six 12-pound guns and one 18-pounder, crewed by about 100 men. [...] Independence of eight guns total, raised her colors followed by Libertador which then fired the first broadside that had no effect. Shortly afterward Independence fired a broadside with her weather battery of one 9-pound gun, three 6-pound guns, and one pivot gun. For two hours, Independence continued up Brazos River with the Mexican brigs in close pursuit, occasionally stopping to fire on each other. By 11:30 am the Texans had reached Velasco; Captain Wheelwright {{had no choice but to}} fight to the end, apparently not being able to continue up the Brazos River any further. The final engagement took place right in front of the small Texan town and populace, including the Texas Secretary of the Navy Samuel Rhoads Fisher. The Mexicans not being far behind came within range and Captain Wheelwright ordered his men to engage once more. The shots managed to damage the main top-gallant mast of the Libertador. After another broadside in Libertadors direction, two Mexicans lay dead and a few more were wounded aboard the brig-of-war. More shots damaged Libertadors foremast and knocked out one of her 12 pounders. However, these broadsides did not slow the Mexican ships; Libertador approached Independence head on while Vincedor del Alamo maneuvered around to Independences other side. The two brigs quickly came within pistol shots range and both fired a mixture of cannon projectiles. This is when a ball smashed through Independences quarter gallery wall and into the Texan captain, taking off three of <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> his right hand. Severely wounded and taken below, command of the schooner passed to Lieutenant John W. Taylor, who finished the last few moments of battle before receiving orders from Wheelwright to surrender. With this action, the battle was over.|$|E

Hitler suddenly turned around, went to a small table from which he took a water glass and furiously smashed it on the floor. In the face of such diplomatic behavior, I had to consider my mission terminated".|$|E

2500|$|Mesmer treated {{patients}} both {{individually and}} in groups. With individuals {{he would sit}} in front of his patient with his knees touching the patient's knees, pressing the patient's thumbs in his hands, looking fixedly into the patient's eyes. Mesmer made [...] "passes", moving his hands from patients' shoulders [...] down along their arms. He then pressed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> the patient's [...] hypochondrium region (the area below the diaphragm), sometimes holding his hands there for hours. Many patients felt peculiar sensations or had convulsions that were regarded as crises and supposed to bring about the cure. Mesmer would often conclude his treatments by playing some music on a glass armonica.|$|E
2500|$|The missionary {{position}} has potential for clitoral stimulation in several ways. Christakos assures, [...] "This position {{can give the}} woman plenty of clitoral stimulation if the man leans forward thus rubbing his pelvic bone against her clitoris." [...] Emily Queenie Chung notes, [...] "Also, this position is the easiest {{for a woman to}} stimulate her clitoris manually." [...] Sexual Health Resource notes that also [...] "the man can reach under and stimulate his partner using <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> her clitoris" [...] although [...] "the man has limited use of his hands" [...] (presumably this would depend on the variant of the position used and whether the man's hands are occupied holding himself up).|$|E
2500|$|Groucho {{maintained}} his irrepressible {{sense of humor}} to the very end, however. [...] George Fenneman, his radio and TV announcer, good-natured foil, and lifelong friend, often related a story {{of one of his}} final visits to Groucho's home: When the time came to end the visit, Fenneman lifted Groucho from his wheelchair, put his arms around his torso, and began to [...] "walk" [...] the frail comedian backwards across the room towards his bed. As he did, he heard a weak voice in his ear: [...] "Fenneman," [...] whispered Groucho, [...] "you always were a lousy dancer." [...] When a nurse approached him with a thermometer during his final hospitalization, explaining that she wanted to see if he had a temperature, he responded, [...] "Don't be silly—everybody has a temperature." [...] Actor Elliott Gould recalled a similar incident: [...] "I recall the last time I saw Groucho, he was in the hospital, and he had tubes in his nose and what have you," [...] he said. [...] "And when he saw me, he was weak, but he was there; and he put <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> the tubes and played them like it was a clarinet. Groucho played the tubes for me, which brings me to tears." ...|$|E
