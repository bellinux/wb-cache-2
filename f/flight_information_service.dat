25|$|Lufttransport won {{the tender}} valid from 1 August 2005, winning ahead of CHC with a bid of NOK56 million. Lufttransport renewed the {{contract}} {{for a new}} three years starting 1 August 2008, after {{they were the only}} bidder in the tender. They received NOK102 million for three years. During this period better navigational aids were installed, allowing helicopters to operate during twice per day also during the dark period of the year. Lufttransport was the only bidder for the following contract, which lasts three years from 1 August 2011. The subsidies for this period are NOK96 million. Because it only serves helicopters, Værøy does not have an aerodrome <b>flight</b> <b>information</b> <b>service</b> (AFIS). As part of the Single European Sky ATM Research program, Avinor installed a remote AFIS service at Værøy, which is controlled from Bodø.

25|$|When {{the airport}} opened, {{it had not}} yet had its landing fees {{approved}} of by the authorities, {{and use of the}} airport was at first free. The airport did not have any scheduled flights, but Norsk Hydro operated a number of charter flights, mostly to Oslo, operated by Coast Aero Center. At first, the airport did not have any employees, so the snow clearance was done by the municipality. In early 1986, the airport's two first employees were hired, both working with <b>flight</b> <b>information</b> <b>service.</b> The airport had no rights for any state grants, so the company had to raise additional capital to cover operating expenses and pay the NOK2.5 million the instrument landing system cost. In March 1986 the airport was granted NOK1.5 from the Ministry of Finance to cover parts of the cost. The airport was set up with Category II, but lacked pulsating light approach slope indicator and approach lighting system.|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} is an overview on Satellite Communication for the Aeronautical Telecommunication Management (ATM) research. Satellite Communications are being {{considered by the}} FAA and NASA as a possible alternative to {{the present and future}} ground systems supporting Air Traffic Communications. The international Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) have in place Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS) for the Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Services (AMSS) which is mainly derived from the pre-existing Inmarsat service that has been in service since the 1980 s. The Working Group A of the Aeronautical Mobile Communication Panel of ICAO has also been investigating SARPS for what is called the Next Generation Satellite Service (NGSS) which conforms less to the Inmarsat based architecture and explores wider options in terms of satellite architectures. Several designs are being proposed by Firms such as Boeing, ESA, NASA that are geared toward full or secondary usage of satellite communications for ATM. Satellite communications for ATM can serve several purposes ranging from primary usage where ground services would play a minimal backup role, to an integrated solution where it will be used to cover services, or areas that {{are less likely to be}} supported by the proposed and existing ground infrastructure. Such Integrated roles can include usage of satellite communications for oceanic and remote land areas for example. It also can include relieving the capacity of the ground network by providing broadcast based <b>services</b> of Traffic <b>Information</b> <b>Services</b> messages (TIS-B), or <b>Flight</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Services</b> (FIS-B) which can take a significant portion of the ground system capacity. Additionally, satellite communication can play a backup role to support any needs for ground replacement, or additional needed capacity even after the new digital systems are in place. The additional bandwidth that can be provided via satellite communications can also open the door for many new applications that generally will enhance the standard services provided. All of those possibilities were investigated and comments, as well as descriptions of those analyses are put forward, as well as suggestions for future areas of study...|$|R
