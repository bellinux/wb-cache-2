500|$|Gavin, {{commanding}} the 82nd Airborne Division, was {{highly critical of}} Browning, writing in his diary on 6 September 1944 that he [...] "...unquestionably lacks the standing, influence and judgement {{that comes from a}} proper troop experience.... his staff was superficial... Why the British units fumble along... becomes more and more apparent. Their tops lack the know-how, never <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> down into the dirt and learn the hard way." ...|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Threshold" [...] {{is about}} {{reaching}} one's limit {{with a person}} in a situation where one is about to breakâ€”and are about to blow up as they get [...] "under your skin", while [...] "Cast Down" [...] features a fallen angel who falls into drugs. [...] "God Send Death" [...] and [...] "Deviance" [...] take up the idea of killing people for pleasure. Both songs were written by Hanneman. Having read several books on serial killers, Hanneman came to the conclusion he could only kill someone if they really [...] "pissed him off", and decided he was unable to kill someone he did not know just for power. He later admitted {{he was trying to get}} into that person's mind; [...] "why <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> off on it? Without being angry, just killing for the sake of killing and getting off on it. I just wanted to get into that mindset." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I've {{kept quiet}} too long, but since I'm leaving there's nothing {{they can do}} about me. I think the refereeing in this league is atrocious[...] [...] What {{do you do with}} bad {{officials}}? [...] <b>Do</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> fired? [...] You fire bad players and bad coaches. Bad officials get a raise and go fishing." ...|$|E
5000|$|... (Character): A {{great big}} pair of polka dot shorts?Polkaroo: How <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> there?! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "However <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> poor Codfish to {{come along}} with them?" [...] queried Andy. [...] "They'll plague {{the life out of}} that little sneak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> to {{know each}} other, I wonder?' she mused as she retreated. 'Anna is really very forward--and he very wicked and nice.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think, and think, till {{my brain}} is all frazzled out," [...] he tells me; [...] "and yet I can't get {{a line on}} it. I know every inch of space on the Elsinore, and know there isn't an ounce of grub {{anywhere}} for'ard, and yet they eat! I've overhauled the lazarette. As near as I can make it out, nothing is missing. Then where <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> it? That's what I want to know. Where <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> it?" ...|$|E
60|$|But where <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> their food? It is a sea-mystery in itself, {{although}} I {{might not}} so deem it {{were it not}} for Mr. Pike.|$|E
6000|$|... "Reckon there's {{about a dozen}} in the bunch," [...] {{observed}} the calm Lash. [...] "Some hosses they're ridin'. Where 'n the hell <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> such hosses, anyhow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They have,--have they? Then at last {{we shall}} know all about the diamonds." [...] This was gall to poor Lizzie. [...] "Where <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Link Merwell and Nick Jasniff!" [...] murmured Dave. [...] "How in {{the world}} <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> here, and what underhanded work are they up to now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, a chap's {{assumed to}} be {{innocent}} until he's proved guilty,' said Stalky, mounting step by step. 'How <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> you into the sack, Mr. Wontner?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But the failures," [...] Robina persisted; [...] "I do {{not mean}} the silly or the wicked people; {{but the people who}} begin by really loving one another, only to end in disliking--almost hating one another. How <b>do</b> <b>THEY</b> <b>get</b> there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Professor," [...] said I, {{when the}} camera spidered round the corner, [...] "there is {{something}} wrong with this people. They won't work, they aren't all dacoits, and their babies run about with hundred-rupees putsoes on them, while their parents speak the truth. How in the world <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> a living?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see {{why they}} give us this old-fashioned junk by Milton and Shakespeare and Wordsworth and all these has-beens," [...] he protested. [...] "Oh, I guess I could stand it to see a show by Shakespeare, if they had swell scenery {{and put on a}} lot of dog, but to sit down in cold blood and READ 'em--These teachers--how <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> that way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> it from you?" [...] the {{proprietor}} of the museum asked {{for the purpose of}} gaining time in the hope the constables would put in an appearance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} questioner, [...] "the {{mistress}} is a lady, she is, and gentle like the squire who's gone. But how <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> such a one as Master Anthony?" ...|$|R
50|$|From {{the end of}} the 14th century <b>they</b> ceased <b>getting</b> other offices {{or other}} estates, and relapsed into the world of the well-off country nobility. Only {{after the fall of the}} Medieval Hungary (1541) <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> {{political}} roles within the Transylvanian Principality.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> {{matter to}} fill up a page in this little island [...] lost in the wastes of the Indian Ocean? Oh, Madagascar. They [...] discuss Madagascar and France. That is the bulk. Then they chock [...] up the rest with advice to the Government. Also, slurs upon the [...] English administration. The papers are all owned and edited by [...] creoles--French.|$|E
6000|$|That, I think, was our limit that evening. She went to bed, smiling good-night quite prettily {{down the}} big staircase, and I and Willersley {{went out to}} smoke in the garden. My head was full of her, and I found it {{necessary}} to talk about her. So I made her a problem in sociology. [...] "Who the deuce are these people?" [...] I said, [...] "and how <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> a living? They seem to have plenty of money. He strikes me as being--Willersley, what is a drysalter? I think he's a retired drysalter." ...|$|E
6000|$|Where <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> the money? Coming up redheaded curates {{from the}} county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, lo and behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. Then thin of the competition. General thirst. Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub. Save it they can't. Off the drunks perhaps. Put down three and carry five. What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and drabs. On the {{wholesale}} orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers. Square it you with the boss and we'll split the job, see? ...|$|E
6000|$|The Englishman grinned. [...] "From {{the fuss}} they made," [...] he said, [...] "the beggars must be awfully hungry. They {{like to have}} eaten me alive when they brought me in. How <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Two {{weeks prior}} to the 2010 general election, Green came out in support of David Cameron, George Osborne and the Conservative Party, stating that Cameron and Osborne [...] "understand {{what needs to be}} <b>done.</b> <b>They</b> <b>get</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rather {{a curious}} {{place to put}} them!" [...] Whitney commented. [...] "I suppose a shaving had stuck under a valve and stopped the pump. But, as you'd have a grid on the suction-box, how <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> in?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{brothers}} have squaws--they have pappooses. When the pappoose {{is put into}} their arms, <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> the paint-stones, and paint it red? They do not. It is not necessary. The Manitou painted it red before it was born. How this was done I do not know. I am nothing but a poor Injin, and only know what I see. I have seen that the pappooses are red when they are born, and that the warriors are red when they die. They are also red while living. It is enough. Their fathers could never have been pale-faces, or we should find some white spots on their children. There are none.|$|E
6000|$|But live or die, win or lose, what <b>do</b> <b>THEY</b> <b>get?</b> English glory is too genteel to meddle {{with those}} humble fellows. She does not condescend {{to ask the}} names of the poor devils whom she kills in her service. Why was not every private man's name written upon the stones in Waterloo Church as well as every officer's? Five hundred pounds to the stone-cutters would have served to carve the whole catalogue, and paid the poor {{compliment}} of recognition to men who died in doing their duty. If the officers deserved a stone, the men did. But come, let us away and drop a tear over the Marquis of Anglesea's leg! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And what, after all, {{is the use}} {{of these}} wars?" [...] said she to herself [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> by taking so many towns, and getting so many guns, and killing so many men? I don't know who's the better for it, but I know very well who's the worse. Why can't they let the blues alone; and the blues let them alone? I worked my poor fingers to the bone making a white flag before they went to Saumur, and all they did was to leave it in the streets of Nantes. There's {{not so much as a}} bottle of beer, and hardly a bushel of flour left in Echanbroignes. There's the poor dear lovely Cathelineau dead and gone. There's M. Henri engaged to the girl of his heart, and he can't so much as stay a day from {{fighting}} to get himself married; and there's Jacques just as bad. If Jacques cares a bit for me, he must take himself off, and me with him, to some place where there's not quite so much fighting, or else I'll be quit of him and go without him. I've no idea of living in a place where girls are not, to be married till the wars are over. Wars, wars, wars; I'm sick of the wars with all my heart." ...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{special feature}} of the series was that some episodes were done entirely in rhyme, {{in which case the}} {{character}} who found the polka dot shorts would exclaim, [...] "Polka dot shorts, a great big pair! How on earth <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> there?" ...|$|R
50|$|April 22 - The Pirates {{lost to the}} New York Yankees 11-5 {{after beating}} {{them in the first}} game of the series. The series marks the first series of the year where the Pirates did not sweep their {{opponent}} nor <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> swept.|$|R
5000|$|At {{one point}} in every episode, {{one or more of}} the {{characters}} would discover a large pair of polka dot shorts, and exclaim, [...] "A great big pair of polka dot shorts! How <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> there?" [...] Polkaroo's response would be, [...] "I haven't the foggiest!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll come {{up after}} dinner, fast enough," [...] he said, simply. [...] "I don't care about much wine afterwards--I take my whack at dinner--I mean my share, you know; and when I have {{had as much}} as I want I toddle up to tea. I'm a {{domestic}} character, Miss Amory--my habits are simple--and when I'm pleased I'm generally in a good-humour, ain't I, Pen?--that jelly, if you please--not that one, the other with the cherries inside. How the doose <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> those cherries inside the jellies?" [...] In this way the artless youth prattled on: and Miss Amory listened to him with inexhaustible good-humour. When the ladies took their departure for the upper regions, Blanche made {{the two young men}} promise faithfully to quit the table soon, and departed with kind glances to each. She dropped her gloves on Foker's side of the table and her handkerchief on Pen's. Each had had some little attention paid to him: her politeness to Mr. Foker was perhaps a little more encouraging than her kindness to Arthur: but the benevolent little creature did her best to make both the gentlemen happy. Foker caught her last glance as she rushed out of the door; that bright look passed over Mr. Strong's broad white waistcoat and shot straight at Harry Foker's. The door closed on the charmer: he sate down with a sigh, and swallowed a bumper of claret.|$|E
6000|$|Whose cash is it {{then they}} are spending? It is not got {{honestly}} by work. You know that much. Where <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> it from? Who has paid for their dinner and their pot? Those fellows can only {{live in one of}} two ways--by pillage or beggary. Their annual income by thieving comes out of the public pocket, you will admit. They are not cheaply fed, so far as they are fed by theft. But the rest of their living--all that they don't steal--they must beg. Not with success from you, you think. Wise, as benevolent, you never gave a penny in [...] "indiscriminate charity." [...] Well, I congratulate you on the freedom of your conscience from that sin, mine being bitterly burdened with the memory of many a sixpence given to beggars of whom I knew nothing but that they had pale faces and thin waists. But it is not that kind of street beggary that is the worst beggars' trade. Home alms which it is their worst degradation to receive. Those scamps know well enough that you and your wisdom are worth nothing to them. They won't beg of you. They will beg of their sisters, and mothers, and wives, and children, and of any one else who is enough ashamed of being of the same blood with them to pay {{to keep them out of}} sight. Every one of those blackguards is the bane of a family. That is the deadly [...] "indiscriminate charity"--the charity which each household pays to maintain its own private curse.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Purely temporary, both. And then, {{look at it}} {{in another}} way. Think of the joy and relief of the {{bereaved}} parents when sonny comes toddling home again! Surely it is worth some temporary distress to taste that supreme happiness? In a sense, you might call me a human benefactor. I teach parents to appreciate their children. You know what parents are. Father gets caught short in steel rails one morning. When he reaches home, what does he do? He eases his mind by snapping at little Willie. Mrs Van First-Family forgets to invite mother to her freak-dinner. What happens? Mother takes it out of William. They love him, maybe, but they are too used to him. They do not realize all he is to them. And then, one afternoon, he disappears. The agony! The remorse! [...] "How could I ever have told our lost angel to stop his darned noise!" [...] moans father. [...] "I struck him!" [...] sobs mother. [...] "With this jewelled hand I spanked our vanished darling!" [...] "We were not worthy to have him," [...] they wail together. [...] "But oh, if we could but get him back!" [...] Well they <b>do.</b> <b>They</b> <b>get</b> him back as soon as ever they care to come across in unmarked hundred-dollar bills. And after that they think twice before working off their grouches on the poor kid. So I bring universal happiness into the home. I don't say father doesn't get a twinge every now and then when he catches sight of the hole in his bank balance, but, darn it, what's money for if it's not to spend?' ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{laughed at}} the ill-made dresses, and winked {{over the heads of}} the old wives when they talked in dialect, and made fun of the boys who came courting her, and sang [...] "Where <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> those hats?" [...] after coming out of the church.|$|R
5000|$|... "What {{were the}} people and tribals of Lalgarh looking for? They were simply looking for dignity, {{security}} and relief from abject poverty. And what <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> in return? <b>They</b> got the lathis and bullets as they were terrorised by the CPI-M and the police." [...] Derek O'Brien, TMC spokesperson.|$|R
5000|$|Actual big {{brand names}} were {{referenced}} in episodes {{in order to}} evoke a sense of realism, though the companies who own the brands did not pay for this, nor <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>get</b> script approval. In the pilot, singer Kelly Clarkson performed {{a modified version of}} the McDonald's slogan [...] "You deserve a break today".|$|R
