60|$|These, {{two letters}} {{provoked}} {{a shower of}} rejoinders, in which, according to Cooper, misstatements were mingled with scurrility. He commenced a series of letters on the question in dispute, which {{were published in the}} National, a <b>daily</b> <b>sheet,</b> and gave the first evidence of that extraordinary acuteness in controversy which was no less characteristic of his mind than the vigor of his imagination. The enemies of La Fayette pressed into their service Mr. Leavitt Harris, of New Jersey, afterwards our chargé d'affaires at the court of France, but Cooper replied to Mr. Harris in the National of May 2d, 1832, closing a discussion in which he had effectually silenced those who objected to our institutions on the score of economy. Of these letters, which would form an important chapter in political science, no entire copy, I have been told, {{is to be found in}} this country.|$|E

The accurate and voluminous speech came off with considerable credit to himself,--credit of that quiet, enduring kind which is accorded to such men. The speech was respectable, dull, and correct. Men listened to it, or sat with their hats over their eyes, asleep, pretending to do so; and the daily Jupiter in the morning had a leading article about it, which, however, left the reader at its close altogether in doubt whether Mr Palliser might be {{supposed to be a}} great financial pundit or no. Mr Palliser might become a shining light to the moneyed world, and a glory to the banking interests; he might be a future Chancellor of the Exchequer. But then again, it might turn out that, in these affairs, he was a mere ignis fatuus, a blind guide,--a man to be laid aside as very respectable, but of no depth. Who, then, at the present time, could judiciously risk his credit by declaring whether Mr Palliser understood his subject or did not understand it? We are not content in looking to our newspapers for all the information that earth and human intellect can afford; but we demand from them what we might demand if a <b>daily</b> <b>sheet</b> could come to us from the world of spirits. The result, of course, is this,--that the papers do pretend that they have come daily from the world of spirits; but the oracles are very doubtful, as were those of old.|$|E

Accordingly, La Croix transitioned into a daily on 16 June 1883. Father Emmanuel d'Alzon (1810-1880), the founder of the Assumptionists and the Oblates of the Assumption, started the paper, although its biggest early advocate was Father Vincent-de-Paul Bailly.

30|$|The camera {{response}} and the radionuclide activity meter variations via, respectively, the sensitivity factor and the constancy were considered fixed {{effects in the}} model. According to the results, camera sensitivity variations were small and {{had little effect on}} the variance of the calibration factor. The extrinsic flood source count rate was corrected for dead time using a paralyzable model, while current SPECT cameras are neither purely paralyzable nor non-paralyzable [16]. It is possible that errors due to this correction masked the usefulness of the sensitivity factor to explain variations in the calibration factor. Furthermore, the extrinsic flood was acquired with a 57 Co source and LEHR collimator, while the calibration factor was measured with an 131 I source and HEGP collimator. Thus, the camera sensitivity factor would not explain variations in the calibration factor that depended on radionuclide or collimator. Nevertheless, these results do not support the use of a 57 Co source as a predictor of small variations in the calibration factor. However, since the data here did not have instances where there were large variations due to factors such as photomultiplier tube failure, they do not provide information about the utility in such cases. Thus, <b>daily</b> <b>sheet</b> source count rate may still be useful for quantitative quality control.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of self-monitoring on the homework completion and accuracy rates of four, fourth-grade {{students with disabilities in}} an inclusive general education classroom. A multiple baseline across subjects design was utilized to examine four dependent variables: completion of spelling homework, accuracy of spelling homework, completion of math homework, accuracy of math homework. Data were collected and analyzed during baseline, three phases of intervention, and maintenance. ^ Throughout baseline and all phases, participants followed typical classroom procedures, brought their homework to school each day and gave it to the general education teacher. During Phase I of the intervention, participants self-monitored with a <b>daily</b> <b>sheet</b> at home and on the computer at school in the morning using KidTools (Fitzgerald 2 ̆ 6 Koury, 2003); a student friendly, self-monitoring program. They also participated in brief daily conferences to review their self-monitoring sheets with the investigator, their special education teacher. Phase II followed the same steps except conferencing was reduced to two days a week, which were randomly selected by the researcher and Phase III conferencing was one random day a week. Maintenance data were taken over a two-to-three week period subsequent {{to the end of the}} intervention. ^ Results of this study demonstrated self-monitoring substantially improved spelling and math homework completion and accuracy rates of students with disabilities in an inclusive, general education classroom. On average, completion and accuracy rates were highest over baseline in Phase III. Self-monitoring led to higher percentages of completion and accuracy during each phase of the intervention compared to baseline, group percentages also rose slightly during maintenance. Therefore, results suggest self-monitoring leads to short-term maintenance in spelling and math homework completion and accuracy. ^ This study adds to the existing literature by investigating the effects of self-monitoring of homework for students with disabilities included in general education classrooms. Future research should consider selecting participants with other demographic characteristics, using peers for conferencing instead of the teacher, and the use of self-monitoring with other academic subjects (e. g., science, history). Additionally, future research could investigate the effects of each of the two self-monitoring components used alone, with or without the conferencing. ...|$|E

Os tratamentos constituíram-se de 4 lâminas de irrigação (H 0  testemunha, H 1, H 2 e H 3), aspergidas sobre o dossel e 2 clones (E. urophylla x E. grandis  CA e E. urophylla var. plathyphylla  CB). Foram avaliados: diâmetro de caule (DC), altura da parte aérea (HPA), área foliar (AF), massa seca foliar (MSF), caulinar (MSC), da parte aérea (MSPA), radicular (MSR) e total (MST), em função da idade (dias após estaquia) e por meio dos rendimentos na produtividade, proporcionados pelos níveis de lâmina total aplicada. Os parâmetros climáticos coletados foram: temperatura do ar, umidade relativa do ar, evaporação e chuva. Os tratamentos influenciaram no crescimento das mudas. Durante E 1, a lâmina irrigada (LI) variou entre 292, 54 mm no nível H 0 e 65, 09 mm no nível H 3. Com o acréscimo da chuva (304, 6 mm), a lâmina total (LT) aplicada sobre o dossel variou entre 597, 14 e 369, 69 mm nos níveis H 0 e H 3, respectivamente. A chuva ocorrida no período influenciou muito na irrigação. O clone CB proporcionou o maior crescimento, sendo a LT H 2 considerada a mais adequada (426, 46 mm). A faixa de água responsável pela máxima produtividade variou entre 369, 69 mm (MSR) e 508, 22 mm (MSC) para o clone CA e entre 435, 49 mm (MSC) e 475, 01 mm (HPA) para o clone B. Recomenda-se a aplicação de uma lâmina diária estimada (LDE) em torno de 7, 6 mm. dia- 1. Durante E 2, a LI variou entre 399, 934 mm no nível H 0 e 69, 92 mm no nível H 3. A lâmina de chuva (LC) foi de 55 mm elevando a LT para 443, 93 e 124, 92 mm nos níveis H 0 e H 3, respectivamente. A irrigação foi a {{principal}} fonte de aplicação de água. O clone CA garantiu o maior crescimento, sendo a LT do nível H 1 (330, 75 mm) responsável pelos incrementos superiores. Os pontos de ótimo produtivo foram obtidos com a lâmina máxima (Lmax) entre 328, 49 mm (MSF) e 359, 69 mm (HPA) para CA e entre 338, 47 mm (MSF) e 388, 55 mm (DC) para CB. É recomendada a utilização de uma LDE de 6 mm. dia- 1. No E 3, a LI variou entre 402, 90 e 69, 35 mm para os níveis H 0 e H 3, respectivamente. A LC foi de 235, 08 mm. A LT variou entre 638, 73 mm em H 0 e 305, 13 mm em H 3. O melhor nível de aplicação hídrica foi o H 1, com LT de 520, 47 mm, sendo o CA o clone com maior crescimento. As Lmax responsáveis pela maior rentabilidade foram entre 523, 48 mm e 564, 97 mm, para os parâmetros HPA e DC, respectivamente, no caso do clone CA e entre 511, 23 mm (MSR) e 544, 24 mm (MSF) para o clone CB. A LDE recomendada foi em torno de 9, 3 mm. dia- 1. Durante a fase de crescimento, conclui-se que a água aplicada pela testemunha (H 0) é maior do que as necessidades hídricas das mudas de eucalipto. With {{the purpose of}} optimizing the applied irrigation depth during the production of eucalypts (clone seedlings), through morphologic evaluations, three experiments (E 1 - summer 2003, E 2 - winter 2003 and E 3 - summer 2004), during 56 days, were {{carried out in the}} nursery forest (opened field) of the Eucatex S/A Company, using randomized blocks statistical design (with sub-plots in strips). The treatments were constituted of 4 irrigation depth (H 0 - control, H 1, H 2 and H 3), sprinkled on the canopy and 2 clones (E. urophylla x E. grandis - CA and E. urophylla var. plathyphylla - CB). The stem diameter (DC), the height of the aerial part (HPA), the leaf area (AF) and the dry mass of leaf (MSF), stem (MSC), aerial part (MSPA), root (MSR) and total (MST) were evaluated in function of the age (days after cutting) and through the incomes in the productivity, proportionate for the levels of applied total sheet. The collected climatic parameters were: temperature of the air, relative humidity of the air, evaporation and rain. The treatments influenced in the growth of the seedlings. During E 1, the irrigated depth (LI) it varied among 292. 54 mm in the level H 0 and 65. 09 mm in the level H 3.

40|$|Background: Physical {{activity}} has demonstrated benefits in cancer-related fatigue and physical functioning in early-stage cancer patients, however {{the role of}} physical activity at the end stage of cancer has not been established. To challenge positivist–empiricist assumptions, I am seeking {{to develop a new}} theoretical framework that is grounded in the advanced cancer patient’s experience of activity. Aim: To gain an in-depth understanding of the experience of activity and quality of life in advanced cancer patients. Objectives: (1) To explore the meaning of activity for advanced cancer patients {{in the context of their}} day-to-day life, (2) to elicit advanced cancer patients’ perceptions of activity with respect to their quality of life, and (3) to elicit advanced cancer patients’ views of barriers and facilitators to activity in the context of their day-to-day life. Study Design: A two-phase, cross-sectional, qualitative study will be conducted through the postpositivist lens of subtle realism and informed by the principles of grounded theory methods. Study Methods: Advanced cancer patients will be recruited through the outpatient department of a tertiary cancer center. For Phase one, participants will wear an activPAL™ activity monitor and fill out a <b>daily</b> record <b>sheet</b> for seven days duration.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Progressive muscle {{relaxation}} is a non-invasive, cost-effective and complication less method {{which can be}} performed independently by the individual. Considering the importance of psychological problems during pregnancy, {{the purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of progressive {{muscle relaxation}} counseling on anxiety among primigravida women referred to health care centers in Hamadan, Iran. Materials and Methods: This study was a randomized clinical trial with two groups (experimental and control) with pre-test and post-test. A total of 120 women were referred to health centers in Hamadan who were experiencing their first pregnancy and were consecutively enrolled in the study, after obtaining informed consents. They were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups (60 women in each group) by allocation concealment. The control group only received routine prenatal care, but the experimental group after two counseling sessions and learning muscle relaxation techniques performed progressive muscle relaxation exercises from 21 - 22 weeks for 10 weeks, and completed the <b>daily</b> performance <b>sheet</b> of relaxation. The study data collection tools included a demographic questionnaire, Spielberger state-trait anxiety inventory, and the <b>daily</b> performance <b>sheet</b> for the intervention group.

40|$|Background: Cancer-related {{fatigue and}} loss of {{physical}} functioning are distressing symptoms which negatively impact {{the quality of life}} of people with advanced cancer. Physical activity has been shown to have positive effects on these symptoms in early stage cancer, but previous research has demonstrated an incongruence between people with advanced cancer’s expressed interest and actual participation in a physical activity intervention. Aim: The aim of this two-phase, cross-sectional study was to gain an in-depth understanding of the experience of activity and quality of life in people with advanced cancer, using a classic grounded theory approach. Methods: Phase One involved participants wearing an activPAL™ activity monitor and filling out a <b>daily</b> record <b>sheet</b> for seven days duration; Phase Two involved face-to-face, semi-structured interviews using the <b>daily</b> record <b>sheets</b> and activity monitor outputs as qualitative probes. From an outpatient department of a tertiary cancer centre in Alberta, Canada, theoretical sampling was used to recruit a total of 15 people with advanced cancer and a median survival of 100 days. Data analysis employed classic grounded theory procedures, including core category emergence, constant comparison of indicators to theoretical saturation, and conceptual memoing. Findings: Maintaining responsibility emerged as the main concern of participants in this study, and downsizing to the critical threshold of responsibility accounted for how this concern was managed. The grounded theory explains how the critical threshold is influenced by conditions unique to people with advanced cancer, and how it is facilitated through activity and other mechanisms. Conclusion: Knowledge of this mid-level theory enables researchers and clinicians to understand activity as a mechanism through which the critical threshold of responsibility is managed, and to inform future behavioural interventions using a theoretical framework which is aligned with the advanced cancer experience...|$|R

Welles may have borrowed Yellow Robe’s name for the script of his classic film [...] "Citizen Kane [...] " [...] (1941), in which the title character's dying word is [...] "Rosebud." [...] Film critic David Thomson stated that {{the origin of the}} name [...] "Rosebud" [...] is the greatest secret in cinema." [...] The acclaimed film transformed a childhood sled into an icon of American culture, and there has been much speculation about the source of the name. [...] In 1991, Edward Castle, a reporter for The Las Vegas Sun, contended that it was Rosebud Yellow Robe’s name that inspired Welles after discovering <b>daily</b> sign-in <b>sheets</b> for the CBS Radio Network, where both Welles and Rosebud worked on dramatic shows during the same time period.|$|R
30|$|Subjects {{were asked}} to collect {{temperature}} measurements in their home for 90 -min each evening through one menstrual cycle by wearing the Chronobra with standardized provided over-clothing. Each study began soon after their last menstrual period, with the cycle “day” recorded {{at the top of}} a <b>daily</b> log <b>sheet,</b> using + 1 as the first day of the menses and so on. After a preliminary 30 -min span, they were required to remain seated and read or watch television for an hour while the instrument recorded the prevailing surface breast temperature. At the end of each 90 -min span, they {{were asked to}} switch off the Chronobra and to record the time and room temperature from a provided desktop instrument on a nearby table. They then measured and recorded their oral temperature (using two thermometers: digital and mercury), regarded as representing the carotoid blood temperature. The log sheet also included a section to note any interfering events during the recording hour of study.|$|R

Parent Involvement in Mathematics Education: Parents and Teachers Working Together to Improve Student Self-Confidence in Mathematics was a mixed methods {{research}} project involving four schools from two rural counties in east-central Minnesota. The {{purpose of the}} study was to test a theory of how parent involvement in math education relates to students’ work ethic and confidence in math. It was a study that used pre- and post- questionnaires given to teachers, students, and parents/guardians along with a <b>daily</b> assignment <b>sheet</b> sent home over the duration of four weeks. The results looked for improvement in students’ self-confidence in mathematics through a supportive learning environment and time spent working on mathematics. University of Minnesota, Duluth.

40|$|For {{the last}} 14 years, the <b>daily</b> goal <b>sheet</b> (DGS) {{has been used}} in our {{surgical}} ICU's to improve communication and ensure best practices for patient care. They have been shown to improve patient care, communication between providers and patient safety (Pronovost et al., 2003). Patient care goals (PCG) are determined on rounds then executed and communicated through orders and protocols. Previous studies of staff satisfaction and use of DGS found that the least and most experienced RN’s ( 6 years) utilized the DGS most often. The value of the DGS as a communication tool varied based on role of the staff (Swoboda et al 2010). This study reviewed the DGS for the plan of care and patients medical record to track completion of goals determined on rounds. The aim {{of this study was to}} further explore the utility of the form and whether goals determined on rounds were actually met to reach patient ICU discharge criteria...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study {{conducted}} to determine if staffing changes were necessary at the information desk at the main branch of the Cleveland Heights-University Heights Public Library (Ohio). Questions addressed included: (1) What times are busiest in the library? (2) Should there be changes in staffing the reference desk {{that could lead to}} increased patron use of this service? and (3) Is the survey form used to collect reference desk transaction data understood and used correctly by those who are completing it? The study analyzed two sets of data. The first set consisted of 52 weeks of data collected using a <b>daily</b> tally <b>sheet</b> for reference queries that used hash marks to record how many times different types of transactions were completed. The second set was a validity test on the tally sheets; a three-page questionnaire asking procedural questions and questions differentiating between types of transactions was given to all 16 people who worked at the reference desk. Findings indicated that changes wer...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to improve First Pass Yield (FPY) and reduce the defect rate of a product. Nowadays, the competitive manufacturing background illustrates that the customers always demanding higher quality in product. Therefore, suppliers strive to satisfy the customer needs beside they are trying to reduce the operating cost and to stay profitable. To survive in a spirited market, improving quality of product is must for any company. In this study, data regarding quantity output of good parts and defective parts has been collected from <b>daily</b> check <b>sheet,</b> critical issues related to defective parts were identified using Pareto analysis chart and its root causes were identified using fishbone diagram. Finally, improvement action plan for critical issues were suggested for quality improvement. After the accomplishment of the action plan, the existing first pass yield is compared with the preliminary first pass yield and substantial improvement in first pass yield attained indicates that defect rate decline with improvement in quality...|$|R
2500|$|New {{cast members}} were told before being hired {{that they would}} be sworn to secrecy about the plot. According to {{producer}} Richard Stokes, some of the new cast were surprised at the requirement. [...] "What was really interesting was the new cast members saying 'what do you mean we won't know'. Some lead actors want to know what happens at the end so they can pitch their performance to it. In this they have to trust Chris and have to trust the directors." [...] Cast members swore not to reveal any details of series two, and were required to sign legally binding non-disclosure agreements. (The Daily Mail called them [...] "the most rigorous confidentiality agreements in the industry.") <b>Daily</b> call <b>sheets</b> used pseudonyms for cast members and characters. Scripts were individually watermarked to prevent them from being photocopied, used pseudonyms for characters, and were locked away by security guards when not in use by the actors. Each actor's or crew member's script had the individual's name watermarked across the page as well, so that leaks could {{be traced back to the}} person responsible.|$|R
