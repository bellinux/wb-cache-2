5|$|The {{rear wheel}} pods {{introduced}} to IndyCar in 2012 {{intended to prevent}} cars from becoming airborne when hitting another in the rear proved to be ineffective as there were major crashes resulting from such contact during the 2013 race in Houston involving Dario Franchitti and the 2017 Indianapolis 500 involving Scott Dixon. In addition the pods were often ripped <b>from</b> <b>cars</b> from light contact, placing hazardous debris on the track. As a result the rear pods were eliminated for 2018.|$|E
5|$|Moderate winds blew {{down about}} 1,600trees in the district, 23 of which fell onto houses. The United States National Arboretum lost many mature trees and azaleas {{on the bank}} of the Anacostia River. The winds also downed many power lines, leaving 129,000customers without power. Many streets were blocked by the fallen trees and power lines. At the White House, the winds downed one tree in the front garden, though there was no damage to the {{building}} itself. The storm surge resulted in flooding at the Washington Navy Yard. There, the marina was damaged, and some buildings and cars in low area garages were flooded. Five people were rescued <b>from</b> <b>cars</b> in flood waters during the storm, and several roads were closed due to the flooding. Throughout the district, the passage of Isabel created approximately 30,000pounds (13,600kg) of debris. Damage in Washington, D.C., totaled $125million (2003USD, ($ USD).|$|E

5|$|The skyrocketing {{prices were}} {{driven by the}} high {{salaries}} paid to pipeline workers, who were eager to spend their money. The high salaries caused a corresponding demand for higher wages among non-pipeline workers in Alaska. Non-pipeline businesses often could {{not keep up with}} the demand for higher wages, and job turnover was high. Yellow Cab in Fairbanks had a turnover rate of 800 percent; a nearby restaurant had a turnover rate of more than 1,000 percent. Many positions were filled by high school students promoted above their experience level. To meet the demand, Lathrop High School ran in two shifts: one in the morning and the other in the afternoon to teach students who also worked eight hours a day. More wages and more people meant higher demand for goods and services. Waiting in line became a fact of life in Fairbanks, and the Fairbanks McDonald's became No. 2 in the world for sales—behind only the recently opened Stockholm store. Alyeska and its contractors bought in bulk from local stores, causing shortages of everything <b>from</b> <b>cars</b> to tractor parts, water softener salt, batteries and ladders.|$|E

25|$|During October 2003, under Néstor Kirchner's government, a {{crackdown}} on illegal phone taps, {{as well as political}} and ideological espionage was ordered to Secretary of Intelligence Sergio Acevedo. More than 160 personnel were expelled from the organization for violations of regulations. An internal security review was also conducted, later producing a report stating several security holes and cases of corruption and theft in the organization (i.e., theft of food, extraction of gasoline <b>from</b> <b>cars</b> and poor security at facilities).|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{nitrogen}} emission is {{a problem}} facing the delicate balance within the ecosystems that contain the Bay checkerspot in many areas. At Coyote Ridge the problem is well documented by conservation biologist Stuart Weiss. Faced with a declining population of Bay checkerspots at Coyote Ridge, Weiss searched for a cause. He found a link {{to a combination of}} pollution from the freeway below the ridge and, again, a cutback in cattle grazing locally. Weiss documented how nitrogen oxide emissions <b>from</b> <b>cars</b> enriched the nutrient-poor serpentine soil. This {{is a prime example of}} the nitrogen effect explained above. Aside from helping decrease nitrogen, the cattle also help to control invasive grasses by eating them. Any question about whether nitrogen emissions <b>from</b> <b>cars</b> traversing U.S. Route 101, 110,000 vehicles daily, is significant evaporates when faced with monitoring statistics from Weiss. His monitoring equipment has confirmed that 15 to 20 pounds of nitrogen per acre is deposited on Coyote Ridge annually. Some of the particles stick to the plant and ground and are washed into the soil, and others are directly absorbed by the plants themselves. By contrast, pollution from power plants and vehicles drops only about four to five pounds of nitrogen per acre per year on the Jasper Ridge preserve.|$|E

25|$|The EU has mainly {{acted to}} {{mitigate}} road transport greenhouse emissions mainly through its voluntary agreement on CO2 emissions <b>from</b> <b>cars</b> and subsequently through Regulation 443/2009 which sets mandatory CO2 emission limits for new cars. The EU promoted {{the use of}} biofuels through the directive on {{the promotion of the}} use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport (2003/30/EC), also known as Biofuel Directive, which calls for countries across the EU aiming at replacing 5,75% of all transport fossil fuels (petrol and diesel) with biofuels by 2010. None of these regulations, however, were based on carbon intensity of fuel. Fuel quality standards in the European Union are regulated by Directive 98/70/EC.|$|E
25|$|The Bay checkerspot went locally extinct {{during the}} early 2000s, last {{observed}} at Edgewood Park in 2002. This local extinction {{has been attributed to}} nitrogen deposition <b>from</b> <b>cars</b> traveling on adjacent Interstate 280, which fertilized invasive Italian ryegrass and choked out native plants required by the butterflies. However, the Italian ryegrass was intentionally planted as an erosion control measure mandated by San Mateo County Planning Department after construction of PG high power lines that cross the park, and spread into the park from that location. Subsequently, attempts to restore the habitat by mowing at an appropriate time of year to reduce the Italian ryegrass and allow the native plants to regrow. In early 2007, 1000 Bay checkerspot larvae were reintroduced to the park.|$|E
25|$|On 1 June 1989, the {{regiment}} was withdrawn <b>from</b> <b>CARS</b> and reorganized under the United States Army Regimental System with headquarters at Nachitoches. Troop E was ordered into active Federal service {{along with the}} rest of the 256th Brigade on 3 December 1990 for the Gulf War and sent to Fort Polk, where it conducted training in preparation for deployment. The troop remained behind at Fort Polk when the majority of the brigade left for Fort Hood to continue its training because it was assigned to a regular unit of the 5th Infantry Division. However, the war ended before the troop could finish training, and it was released from active Federal service on 20 April 1991. On 1 September 1996, the troop was reflagged as Troop A, 108th Cavalry Regiment.|$|E

25|$|In 1974, {{the troop}} {{became the first}} Guard unit to receive the Bell AH-1 HueyCobra attack {{helicopter}} and was redesignated Troop E (Air). It spent its two-week annual training period in August 1980 at the Pohakuloa Training Area alongside troops of the 25th Infantry Division. Around January 1984, the troop received nine AH-1S Cobra helicopters, replacing the older Cobras. Between November 1984 and October 1986, it was commanded by Captain (later Major) Gary M. Hara, who later became deputy commanding general of United States Army Pacific. On 31 July 1986, one of the troop's Bell OH-58A Kiowa helicopters crashed, slightly injuring the pilot and aerial observer. On 1 June 1989, it was withdrawn <b>from</b> <b>CARS</b> and reorganized under United States Army Regimental System (USARS) with headquarters at Fort Ruger. The regiment was disbanded in 1995 around when its last lineage document was written.|$|E
25|$|The McNamara Terminal Parking Structure is an , 10-level facility, {{which opened}} in February 2002. It {{is one of the}} largest parking {{structures}} in the world and includes a ground transportation center, pedestrian bridge, two luggage check-in locations, conveyors and bridges to transport luggage, six restrooms, three offices for parking officials, and two electrical substations. The structure can accommodate 11,489 cars in seven user groups. Parking for the North Terminal is offered in a garage known as the Big Blue Deck. One additional surface lot, named the Green Lot serves as overflow parking. A second surface lot, the Yellow Lot closed April 5, 2012. Four additional, privately owned parking lots are located outside airport grounds (Airlines Parking, Park 'N' Go, Qwik Park, U.S. Park). Motorcycle parking is free at the airport. Motorcycles can be parked in a separate covered area <b>from</b> <b>cars</b> at the McNamara Terminal Parking Structure.|$|E
25|$|On 1 October 1976, the 297th Cavalry {{was broken}} up and {{converted}} into 5th Battalion, 297th Infantry.

The reunited 297th Infantry also included the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battalions. A 4th Battalion was activated on 1 November 1978. On 1 May 1989, the 297th was withdrawn <b>from</b> <b>CARS</b> and reorganized under the United States Army Regimental System (USARS). It was reorganized to add a 6th Battalion on 1 September of that year. The 4th Battalion was inactivated on 30 September 1992, and 3rd and 5th Battalions followed on 1 September 1994. A year later, the regiment was reorganized to consist of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battalions.|$|E

25|$|On 1 June 1989, the 348th was {{withdrawn}} <b>from</b> <b>CARS</b> and reorganized with headquarters at Griffin under the United States Army Regimental System (USARS). On 30 November 1990, {{along with the}} rest of the 48th Brigade, Troop E was ordered into active Federal service at Griffin. With the brigade, the troop trained at the Fort Irwin National Training Center for combat in the Gulf War, but the 48th was not certified combat ready until the day the ground war ended, 28 February 1991, and thus was not deployed. It was released from active duty on 10 April and reverted to state control. On 1 January 1994, it was reorganized, redesignated, and consolidated as Troop E, part of the 48th Infantry Brigade. On 2 September 1995, Troop E was reflagged as Troop E of the newly constituted 108th Cavalry. The regiment was not authorized a coat of arms or a distinctive unit insignia.|$|E
