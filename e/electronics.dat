5|$|NextWorth is an <b>electronics</b> {{trade-in}} {{and recycling}} service. Users {{of the service}} exchange used <b>electronics</b> for cash or discounts on newer models. NextWorth was founded by business students at Babson College in 2005. It started as a commission-based service to help businesses setup online auctions for their used items, then changed its business model to focus on <b>electronics</b> trade-ins in 2006. As of late 2012, NextWorth {{was one of the}} best-known and largest <b>electronics</b> trade-in and recycling services in the United States, although it handles {{only a small percentage of}} total trade-in traffic.|$|E

5|$|Chris Stamper {{was born}} in 1958. He had a long-standing {{interest}} in <b>electronics,</b> and built an oscilloscope in his youth. While at university, he built a kit computer with an 8-bit processor and taught himself how to program by creating traffic light signalling software. He attended Loughborough University of Technology {{with the intent of}} earning degrees in <b>electronics</b> and physics, but left the university in 1981 to pursue computer programming full-time. Chris worked with arcade machine <b>electronics,</b> resolving software bugs and converting Space Invaders into Galaxian machines. He persuaded his brother Tim, two years younger (b. February 1961) to join him. The brothers worked as game designers at the arcade game company Associated Leisure with a college friend, John Lathbury. They followed the company's director when he started his own business, Zilec <b>Electronics,</b> which worked on arcade conversions. They worked on 12 arcade games, including Gyruss and Blue Print, and others whose names were kept secret and sold to other arcade manufacturers, including Konami and Sega. The job included international travel to Japan, where the brothers became acquainted with the Japanese game industry. During this time, Chris purchased, studied, and taught himself to program the new ZX80 processor within two years.|$|E

5|$|<b>Electronics</b> {{deals with}} {{electrical}} circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, optoelectronics, sensors and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies. The nonlinear behaviour of active components {{and their ability}} to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible and <b>electronics</b> is widely used in information processing, telecommunications, and signal processing. The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information processing possible. Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards, <b>electronics</b> packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working system.|$|E
5|$|Gallium is {{predominantly}} used in <b>electronics.</b> Gallium arsenide, the primary chemical compound of gallium in <b>electronics,</b> {{is used in}} microwave circuits, high-speed switching circuits, and infrared circuits. Semiconductive gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride produce blue and violet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and diode lasers. Gallium is also used {{in the production of}} artificial gadolinium gallium garnet for jewelry.|$|E

5|$|Past {{servicing}} missions have exchanged old {{instruments for}} new ones, both avoiding failure and making possible {{new types of}} science. Without servicing missions, all of the instruments will eventually fail. In August 2004, the power system of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) failed, rendering the instrument inoperable. The <b>electronics</b> had originally been fully redundant, but {{the first set of}} <b>electronics</b> failed in May 2001. This power supply was fixed during Servicing Mission 4 in May 2009.|$|E

5|$|Radio-Electronics had {{a smaller}} {{circulation}} than Popular <b>Electronics</b> but {{led the way}} with innovative construction projects between 1972 and 1975. John Simonton's first modular electronic music synthesizer was featured {{on the cover of}} the May 1973 issue. It sold for a fraction of commercial synthesizers and his PAiA <b>Electronics</b> produced them for decades. Don Lancaster's TV Typewriter in September 1973 and Jon Titus's Mark-8 computer in July 1974 were the catalyst of the home computer revolution.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) main camera primary <b>electronics</b> {{failed in}} June 2006, {{and the power}} supply for the backup <b>electronics</b> failed on January 27, 2007. Only the instrument's Solar Blind Channel (SBC) was {{operable}} using the side-1 <b>electronics.</b> A new power supply for the wide angle channel was added during SM 4, but quick tests revealed this did not help the high resolution channel. The Wide Field Channel (WFC) was returned to service by STS-125 in May 2009 but the High Resolution Channel (HRC) remains offline.|$|E
5|$|Sir Clive Sinclair's {{interest}} in the possibilities of electric vehicles originated in the late 1950s during a holiday job for the <b>electronics</b> company Solatron. Fifteen years later, in the early 1970s, he {{was the head of}} his own successful <b>electronics</b> company, Sinclair Radionics, based in St Ives in Cambridgeshire. He tasked one of his employees, Chris Curry – later a co-founder of Acorn Computers – to carry out some preliminary research into electric vehicle design.|$|E
