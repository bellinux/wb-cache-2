5|$|According to Savenko, the Serbsky Center {{has long}} labored to legalize its monopolistic {{position}} of the Main <b>expert</b> institution of the country. The ambition and permissiveness—which, due to proximity to power, allow the Serbsky Center {{to get in touch}} over the telephone with the judges and explain to them who is who and what is the guideline, although the judges themselves have already learned it—have {{turned out to be a}} considerable drop in the level of the <b>expert</b> reports on many positions. Such a drop was inevitable and foreseeable in the context of the Serbsky Center efforts to eliminate adversary character of the <b>expert</b> reports of the parties, then to maximally degrade the role of the specialist as a reviewer and critic of the presented <b>expert</b> report, and to legalize the state of affairs. Lyubov Vinogradova believes there has been a continuous diminution in patients' rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes, cannot speak in court and can do nothing against the State experts.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Savenko {{stated that}} the passed law on the state <b>expert</b> {{activity}} {{and the introduction of}} the profession of forensic <b>expert</b> psychiatrist actually destroyed adversary-based examinations and that the Serbsky Center turned into the complete monopolist of forensic examination, which it had never been under Soviet rule. Formerly, the court could include any psychiatrist in a commission of experts, but now the court only chooses an <b>expert</b> institution. The <b>expert</b> has the right to participate only in commissions that he is included in by the head of his <b>expert</b> institution, and can receive the certificate of qualification as an <b>expert</b> only after having worked in a state <b>expert</b> institution for three years. The Director of the Serbsky Center Dmitrieva was, at the same time, the head of the forensic psychiatry department which is {{the only one in the}} country and is located in her Center. No one had ever had such a monopoly.|$|E

The second level of <b>experts</b> includes those who have knowledge about the relationships of the <b>experts</b> at the first level and each higher level accordingly.

40|$|Question {{answering}} communities (QA) are {{sustained by}} a handful of <b>experts</b> who provide a large number of high quality answers.

We look at users’ behavior and estimate their motivation and ability to help others. These qualities enable us to build classification and ranking models to identify users who are likely to become <b>experts</b> in the future. Our results indicate that the current <b>experts</b> can be effectively identified from their early behavior. We asked community managers to evaluate the potential <b>experts</b> identified by our algorithm and their analysis revealed that quite a few of these users were already <b>experts</b> or on the path of becoming <b>experts.</b> Our retrospective analysis shows that some of these potential <b>experts</b> had already left the community, highlighting the value of early identification and engagement...|$|R
