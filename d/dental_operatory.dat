Many factors contribute to the dental behavior of the child. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of sociodemographic factors, general anxiety, body mass index (BMI), and role of multimedia on the child behavior (CB) in the <b>dental</b> <b>operatory.</b> Materials and Methods: Three hundred and one children aged 3 - 14 years and their parents participated in the study. In the first visit, the questionnaire was filled by the parent and general examination was done.

Sampling methods employed to gather data included personal and area sampling, real time nitrous-oxide sampling, video recording and documentation of work practices and infrared thermography. None of the scavenging systems were found to be adequate to control nitrous-oxide exposures. Tests were conducted in the laboratory and the field to evaluate two new local exhaust systems intended to control patient mouth emissions of nitrous-oxide. Face mask leakage was the primary cause of emissions. The use of exhaust systems placed on the chin or chest, or in the mouth captured mouth emissions.

It cannot be disposed along with biomedical waste (BMW) because mercury-contaminated waste cannot be incinerated or autoclaved. Objectives: To assess the knowledge and observance of proper mercury hygiene and amalgam waste management among general dental practitioners (GDPs). Materials and Methods: A confidential questionnaire containing 14 questions regarding handling and disposal of amalgam was randomly distributed to 175 GDPs in Chandigarh, Panchkula, and Mohali. A response rate of 78 % was obtained, and results were statistically analyzed. Results: Out of total dentists surveyed, 71 % were found to be using amalgam as restorative material, 63 % were doing < 5 amalgam restorations per week. Only 6. 5 % of dentists placed rubber dam during removal and replacement of amalgam restorations. Fifty-five percent of dentists used high-volume evacuation. Filter was used only by 6 % dentists. For 98 %, dentists' evacuation drained into regular drain. Eighty-six percent of dentists never used amalgamator. Only 31 % of dentists stored leftover amalgam scrap in radiographic fixer.

METHODS: This study was a randomised controlled trial performed in a secondary paediatric dental care clinic. The child's perception of the dental treatment and its behaviour during treatment according to the parent and dentist were compared with parental presence in the operatory as independent variable. Age and dental anxiety were also calculated as co-variable. The child's perception of the treatment was assessed using the Wong-Baker Faces Rating Scale. The behaviour of the child according to parent and dentist was measured using Venham`s (modified) clinical rating of anxiety and cooperative behaviour. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann Whitney U tests and Independent Samples T Test. RESULTS: 90 children participated (50 % girls, mean age 6. 21 years old, SD ± 1. 56). During the habituation session child's behaviour was better according to the dentist when the parents were not present in the operatory during treatment (p< 0. 01).

40|$|Background: Adapting a {{child to}} the alien {{settings}} of a <b>dental</b> <b>operatory</b> is a major challenge to the dentist. Fear of the unknown and preconceived notions of dental pain causes anxiety in the pediatric patient. This often leads to disruptive and uncooperative behavior in the <b>dental</b> <b>operatory.</b> Many methods of behavior management have been described, of which the Tell-Show-Do (TSD) is an established and time-tested technique of behavior management. Aim: To determine if a live visual output of the dental operating microscope (DOM) {{could be used as}} an adjunct to the TSD technique, to involve the child more completely in the procedure and reduce the fear of the unknown. Materials and Methods: The study was a randomized, controlled, crossover, and cross-sectional clinical trial. Data were obtained from two visits. 90 children having carious lesions on both lower first molars, in the 7 - 9 years age group were selected and divided randomly into two groups. Restorative procedures were performed on one tooth per visit, with visits 1 week apart. Live display of the procedure was shown to the patient using video output of the DOM displayed on a 72 inch LCD monitor, angled for best visibility of the child. Anxiety levels were evaluated using Venhams picture selection test and pulse oximetry. Statistical Analysis: Student′s t-test was used to compare the anxiety scores obtained from the two groups. Results: The results showed there was a decrease in the anxiety from the first visit to the second visit. (P = 0. 05 for Group A and P = 0. 003 for Group B).

40|$|A {{signaling}} {{device was}} given to patients to reduce stress in the dental chair. Galvanic skin response during the dental procedures indicated a complex relationship. Patients with the signaling device showed less arousal under high stress conditions but somewhat higher arousal under low stress conditions when compared with a control group. Lazarusl has elaborated on the theoretical importance of perceived control in situa-tions that involve psychological stress. In situations where the individual may con-front an impending threat, {{the degree to which}} he is able to perceive himself as hav-ing coping resources will determine, to a great extent, the degree of stress he experi-ences. Consequently, if an individual be-lieves he has some control over what is hap-pening to him in a threatening environ-ment, he will experience less stress then if he believes he has no control. Several laboratory studies using a variety of approaches have demonstrated reduced physiologic arousal under conditions of per-ceived control in connection with aversive stimulation. 2 4 However, {{there is little or no}} evidence to support the usefulness of perceived control paradigms in real-life situa-tions.

On evaluation by photometer it was found that 80 % dentist surveyed carry out shade selection under improper intensity of light. Conclusions: Within the limitations of this study it was concluded that intensity of light in shade selection is the most neglected part & {{there is a need to}} update the knowledge about it. There is a need for regular checkup of lightning in the <b>dental</b> <b>operatory...</b>|$|E
40|$|The oral transmucosal {{formulation}} of fentanyl citrate (OTFC) {{has been reported}} to be an effective sedative, providing convenient and atraumatic sedation for children prior to general anesthesia or painful diagnostic procedures. Thirty-three young children (24 - 60 months of age) scheduled for outpatient general anesthesia for treatment of dental caries were enrolled in this randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial. To determine the effectiveness of the OTFC premedication, patient behavior was evaluated using three distinct outcome ratings. A sedation score rated behavior in the waiting room prior to OTFC as well as 10 minutes and 20 minutes after OTFC. A separation score rated the child's response to being separated from his/her parent or guardian for transport to the <b>dental</b> <b>operatory.</b> Finally, a cooperation score rated the child's acceptance of the mask induction. The OTFC formulation was well tolerated by most of the children in this study. Compared with the placebo oralet, the active OTFC improved behavior for separation from the parent (P <. 05) and cooperation with the mask induction (P <. 05). The duration of surgery and the time of recovery did not differ between placebo and active premedication. Side effects including respiratory and cardiovascular complications were reported more frequently in the active fentanyl group. Continuous monitoring of respiratory function is essential when using this unique and effective {{formulation of}} fentanyl for pediatric preanesthetic sedation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Health {{system should}} be {{organized}} {{to meet the needs}} of entire population of the nation. This means that the state has the direct responsibility for the health of its population and improving the quality of life through research, education, and provision of health services. The present study was conducted to evaluate the government oral health care delivery system in Haryana, India. Materials and Methods: The present cross-sectional study was conducted among 135 dental care units (DCUs) of various primary health centers (PHCs), community health centers (CHCs), and general hospitals (GHs) existing in the state by employing a cluster random sampling technique. Data regarding the provision of water and electricity supply, dental man power and their qualification, number and type of instruments in the <b>dental</b> <b>operatory</b> unit, etc., were collected on a structured format. Statistical analysis was done using number and percentages (SPSS package version 16). Results: Alternative source of electricity (generator) existed in only a few of health centers. About 93. 4 % (155) of the staff were graduates (BDS) and 6. 6 % (11) were postgraduates (MDS). Ultrasonic scaler was available at dental units of 83. 1 % (64) of PHCs, 73. 1 % (19) of CHCs, and 93. 8 % (30) of GHs. Patient drapes were provided in 48. 1 % (65) of the DCUs, doctor′s aprons were provided in 74. 1 % (100) of the places. Conclusion: There is a shortfall in infrastructure and significant problem with the adequacy of working facilities. A great deal of effort is required to harmonize the oral health care delivery system...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Approximately 25 % of all general dentists {{practicing}} in the United States {{use a computer}} in the <b>dental</b> <b>operatory.</b> Only 1. 8 % maintain completely electronic records. Anecdotal evidence suggests that dental computer-based patient records (CPR) do not represent clinical information with {{the same degree of}} completeness and fidelity as paper records. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a basic content model for clinical information in paper-based records and examine its degree of coverage by CPRs. Design: We compiled a baseline dental record (BDR) from a purposive sample of 10 paper record formats (two from dental schools and four each from dental practices and commercial sources). We extracted all clinical data fields, removed duplicates, and organized the resulting collection in categories/subcategories. We then mapped the fields in four market-leading dental CPRs to the BDR. Measurements: We calculated frequency counts of BDR categories and data fields for all paper-based and computer-based record formats, and cross-mapped information coverage at both the category and the data field level. Results: The BDR had 20 categories and 363 data fields. On average, paper records and CPRs contained 14 categories, and 210 and 174 fields, respectively. Only 72, or 20 %, of the BDR fields occurred in five or more paper records. Categories related to diagnosis were missing from most paper-based and computer-based record formats. The CPRs rarely used the category names and groupings of data fields common in paper formats. Conclusion: Existing paper records exhibit limited agreement on what information dental records should contain. The CPRs only cover this information partially, and may thus impede the adoption of electronic patient records. © 2007 J Am Med Inform Assoc...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Dental</b> <b>Operatory</b> is {{the main}} {{structure}} in which Odontology lies. It {{is not an easy}} discipline that gives enjoyable results with little effort due to the difficulties that a correct reconstruction of a destroyed dental element offers. The frequency with which pulpar injury occurs while anchoring additional retainers in complex cavities, the technical difficulties the lack of these devices cause and the need to simplify dental procedures lead this study to show the advantages to substitute additional retainers for a retainer surcus. Method: An observational descriptive study was applied to 53 patients(42 % of the universe), sample which was selected by means of a simple randomized sample. From a proximal-occlusal cavity, the preparations were extended in a box-like shape towards the bucal or lingual region and the additional retainers were substituted for a surcus which was performed in the gingival wall of the preparation. Calcium Hydroxide of rapid dryness was used as a cavity cover and Policarboxilate cement as a base; then the amalgam restoration was performed. The number of restorations were studied taking into account the patient´s age and the failures due to fractures of amalgam, loss of vitality and periapical changes were assessed taking into consideration the patient´s age and a one- year follow up. Results: Most of the amalgam restorations were performed in patients aged from 35 to 59 years and the relative frequencies due to fractures of amalgam, loss of vitality and periapical changes were very low. Conclusion: The substitution of additional retainers for a retainer surcus in complex cavities of vital molars showed to be advantageous because it guarantees a less degree of pulpar damage and less pulpar damage...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the occurrence of accidental occupational exposure among healthcare workers in the dental settings in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and to compare it to what is happening {{in other parts of the}} world. MATERIALS and METHODS: Self-administered questionnaires were distributed among dental specialists, general practitioners, dental interns, hygienists and dental assistants working in the dental college, private clinics and government hospitals in Riyadh. RESULTS: The response rate was 41. 8 %. Only 93 (31. 7 %) of the respondents had one or more occupational injuries during the previous year. Over half (58. 2 %) of these respondents did not report the incident and only 51. 6 % and 40. 9 % wore goggles and gowns, respectively. About 6 % of the female respondents recalled having three or more injuries compared to none of the male respondents but this difference was not found to be statistically significant (P= 0. 22). Specialists showed the highest percentage (73. 9 %) of no injuries (P= 0. 18). The total occupational exposure of the 293 respondents was 168 injuries, giving an injury rate of 0. 57 per person per year. Of these 168 injuries, 89. 2 % involved a finger or thumb. The majority of the occupational injuries (82. 8 %) occurred in the <b>dental</b> <b>operatory</b> and the syringe needle was the most common instrument causing the injuries. The study also showed that the adherence to infection control practices among the sample was inadequate and under reporting of exposure incidence was noticed. About 17 % of the sample did not complete or did not receive any HBV vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that the occurrence of accidental occupational exposure among the dental healthcare workers in Riyadh is low and is comparable to reports from other parts of the world.
