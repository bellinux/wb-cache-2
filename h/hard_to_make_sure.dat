In 1985, bassist John Levén suggested that Tempest should write a song based on that riff. Tempest recorded a demo version of the song and played it for the other band members. At first, the members expressed mixed reactions to it, including guitarist John Norum who was put off by the synth intro but said that he was glad they didn't listen to him. Tempest described their uncertainty: [...] "Some of the guys in the band thought it was too different for a rock band. But in the end I fought <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> it got used." ...|$|E

2500|$|During Nancy's {{relationship}} with Jake Dean, Nancy's character was rapidly transformed {{due to her}} abuse {{at the hands of}} Jake. Fox told a journalist from OK! that when the relationship begins Jake is [...] "very controlling" [...] towards Nancy and he takes away [...] "all the things that made Nancy Nancy – the way she was opinionated and outspoken". She explained that during the storyline Nancy acts out of character which she found challenging to portray. She added that Nancy's abuse at the hands of Jake is psychological abuse rather than physical abuse. Sacre explained that Nancy wants to call off the wedding but Jake [...] "dismisses her concerns and insists the wedding goes ahead. He's kind of bulldozing his way through it all". He added that Jake Nancy still does not feel the wedding is right after he makes the arrangements but Jake still [...] "keeps on pushing and pushing and she gives in". Sacre said that Nancy regrets marrying Jake as soon as she has gone through with the wedding. Jake [...] "ends up trying to force himself on her on their wedding night". Sacre commented that in reaction to this Jake [...] "plays the victim and tries to blame Nancy for what's happened". The actor revealed that while Jake is in [...] "a desperate state" [...] he accidentally tells Nancy that he made allegations that she was having a sexual {{relationship with}} a pupil. Nancy is [...] "incensed", and Fox explained that this revelation is the [...] "final straw" [...] for Nancy who declares the marriage is over as this admission [...] "really shows Jake’s true colours" [...] to her. Fox stated that she and the production team were careful not to have the character return to her previous self, saying: [...] "We've tried really <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that Nancy didn't just snap back into her old self after the whole Jake incident last year. There's always a bit of darkness with her. That's something that really annoys me in soap, when something really dramatic happens to a character and they forget about it a couple of weeks later".|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of unemployment {{due to lack}} of communication and leadership skills {{has become one of the}} main issues among graduates in Malaysia. The rapid changes of knowledge and technology require students to equip themselves with extra skills needed by global workplace to demonstrate the combination of soft skills together with a good degree. Thus, higher education is working <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the students are equipped with leadership skill. However, there are lacking of information, assessment and unclear program contents that can bring positive outcome toward the development of leadership skill. This study aims to examine an outdoor education program as one of the useful programs that higher education could use to identify the leadership practices among the students. It is done by comparing students who have participated in outdoor education program and those who did not participate using convenience sampling. A total of 106 students from the Faculty of Sport Science and Recreation UiTM were involved in this study. The data was collected by using Students Leadership Practices Inventory questionnaire to measure five leadership practices namely as ‘Model the Way’, ‘Inspire a Shared Vision’, Challenge the Process’, ‘Enable Others to Act’ and ‘Encourage the Heart’. Independent sample t-test was used in order to identify a significant difference of five leadership practices between the two groups of students. The results showed that there were significant differences in all five leadership practices among the students who have participated in outdoor education program. Finally, this study has proposed that outdoor education program is one of the effective activities that could be offered to all students by higher education to equip them with leadership skills required for future employability...|$|R

[...] Pitchfork's Hank Shteamer wrote that on From Wisdom to Hate, [...] "Luc Lemay streamlined Obscura's demented sprawl, yielding a less outlandish yet equally distinguished statement.""To choose a word to describe the whole album, I would choose antiquity. That is just a start, but it is a good word as two of the songs on this disc deal with the Middle Ages epoch.

500|$|It was {{announced}} for a release in North America {{under the title}} Muramasa: The Demon Blade in October 2008 for a release the following year. The game was originally being published by Xseed Games, but in April 2009 they announced that they were dropping the title from their schedule. Publishing rights were transferred to Ignition Entertainment. Ignition Entertainment later explained {{that it was in}} hot competition with Xseed and Atlus to acquire the American publishing rights, and after seeing Muramasa at TGS 2008 they were encouraged to apply for the rights. The change between publishers was an internal agreement between Xseed, their parent company Marvelous USA, and Ignition. The situation was amicably resolved as Xseed already had a large number of Wii titles lined up, and giving Muramasa to another publisher allowed multiple titles not to be overlooked when it came to Western publicity. The game released in North America on September 8, 2009. The game's localization was done by external localization companies in close collaboration with Ignition Entertainment. Due to the game's strong Japanese atmosphere, it was seen as a hard sell in the West, but during localization a lot of work went into preserving it rather than adjusting it for Western tastes. Due to this, the game was not dubbed into English, but instead retained its Japanese voice track while text was localized. An aspect Ignition worked <b>hard</b> with was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the localization was of good quality by working closely with their chosen localization partners. This was due to backlash received by fans and critics over the [...] "lackluster" [...] localization of Lux-Pain, which had been beyond their control during development.|$|R
