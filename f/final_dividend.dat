25|$|The {{condition}} of the canal continued to decline, with subsidence occurring at Shipley and under the West Hallam reservoir, on Mapperley Brook, in 1879. Traffic stopped on several occasions, {{due to a lack}} of water in the reservoirs. Excessive wastage from Mapperley reservoir was blamed on Charles Pounder, the canal keeper, and he was asked to leave in 1885, but his successor was worse. A <b>final</b> <b>dividend</b> was paid on the shares in 1885, and by 1888, the canal was barely solvent, for although 35,000 tons of coal and iron were carried, generating £440 of income, maintenance costs alone were £639. The company took legal advice, and it was suggested that they should take action against the collieries, since they had been extracting coal from beneath the canal and reservoirs which rightfully belonged to the canal company. Claims for damages were therefore made against the West Hallam, Ilkeston and Manners collieries. Shipley colliery was exempt, as they had generally paid for any obvious damage caused by their activities below ground. West Hallam colliery denied responsibility, and legal action was taken to obtain the money.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{announcement}} effect of both dividend and corporate earnings on stock prices to examine evidence of semi-strong form efficiency in Malaysian Stock Exchange. A sample of 120 companies listed on the Main Board of Bursa Malaysia that announced the <b>final</b> <b>dividends</b> in their fourth financial quarter was selected covering a time period from January 1, 2006 to November 30, 2006. The study results support the information content of dividend theory that increasing dividend announcements, on an average, earn positive abnormal return, while decreasing dividend announcements are associated with negative abnormal return. Based on the market reaction to both dividend and earnings announcements, this study concludes that both dividends and earnings {{play a significant role}} as signaling effects of the future prospects of the firm, with the dividends effect proving to be significantly stronger than the earnings effect. The results provide some evidence of semi-strong form efficiency in the Malaysian stock market, where stock prices adjust in an efficient manner to dividend and earnings announcements. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2001. The {{objective}} of this mini study project is to record dividends of de-listed companies from copies of Annual Reports. It forms {{part of a larger}} research project at the Graduate School of Business of the University of Stellenbosch that aims at setting up a database containing published financial information on dividends for listed and de-listed companies. Dividends are a valuable source of information content. Recording, and thereafter employing an analysis of basic descriptive statistics on dividends, is one way to decipher such information. Calculating the average and median of dividends declared by companies sheds an insight to the nature of dividend payout. The purpose of the mini study project is to capture the interim, special, and <b>final</b> <b>dividends</b> per share. The method employed is to calculate dividend values and to compare them against those published. Total Rand values of dividends are calculated by multiplying the number of shares issued, by the dividends declared in cents, per share as noted on the directors' report, and notes to the income statement. This is achieved by means of an Excel spreadsheet model...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} stock price behaviour of firms listed on the Johannesburg Securities Exchange (JSE) around corporate events relating to <b>final</b> cash <b>dividend</b> change announcements over the period 2004 to 2009. Declared for the financial year-end, <b>final</b> cash <b>dividend</b> announcements either represent an increase, a reduction or no change relative to the previous year’s announcement. In this paper we analyse the stock price behaviour of firms that announced dividend reductions {{before and during the}} Global Financial Crisis of 2007 (GFC 2007). The pre-crisis analysis focuses on dividend reduction effects on share price during normal economic times and crisis analysis focuses on effects during economic downturn. We refer to the pre and during crises effects as firm-specific and systemic effects respectively. Studies about the general effect of dividend announcements on shareholder value are well documented; however our study is motivated by the fact that there has not been an abundance of forthcoming research in South Africa pertaining to how share prices have reacted to dividend reductions before and during the GFC 2007. We employ an event study methodology {{in the context of this}} emerging market to assess the share price behaviour to dividend reductions. Integral to an event study methodology in the corporate context, is the analysis of abnormal performance around the event date. Abnormal performance is measured by employing three widely used quantitative approaches namely, the market-adjusted, market model and the buy-and-hold abnormal return approaches. Based on daily closing share price information collected from iNet Bridge database, abnormal performance is calculated from 2004 to 2009 while controlling for the contemporaneous effect of earnings announcements (earnings data collected from Bloomberg database) occurring within 10 trading days of dividend announcement. The analysis shows that the market reaction is not statistically significant on the announcement day and that more negative returns occur during the pre-crisis period. Volatility of abnormal returns is higher during the pre-crisis period. The research does not support the Irrelevance Theory but seems to support the signalling hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the results of a survey with Brazilian listed {{companies}} CFOs` trying to identify how these companies determine and manage their payout policy. It was identified that the <b>final</b> decision about <b>dividends</b> is taken by the board of directors, taking into consideration a management proposal sent to them before. Main factors analyzed are net profit and cash generation during immediate previous period. The managers mainly consider interest on own capital (JSCP) and dividends as instruments for payout policy. They believe that share repurchase is advantageous to shareholders; however, it is viewed more as an investment decision by the company than a dividend policy. The interest on own capital is broadly used because it provides a fiscal benefit to the company. It seems that management compensation policy affects dividends payout. This suggests an agency conflict between managers and shareholders...|$|R

The company dominated headlines for six months due to the hostile and public nature of the dispute in Malaysia - a country where such corporate disputes are rarely disclosed publicly. In December 2012 a group of shareholders — Ang Lay Chien, Datuk Seri Syed Ali Abbas Alhabshee, Tee Wee Keat and Lye Jun Fei — with a collective 31.2% share requested an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to remove the existing managing director, Wong See Yaw, as well as Executive Director Yap Kok Eng and independent non-executive directors Wong Siew Yoong and Yeap Cheng Chuan. The board released a press statement on January 14, 2013 stating: “it would seem (the proposed directors) have very little or no knowledge of (Bright Packaging’s) current business”. News {{of a change in}} board drove share prices to a ten-year high of $2.10. Following the call for the EGM, Bright Packaging’s board announced a five-year, 100% dividend payout policy to demonstrate its commitment to its shareholders.
