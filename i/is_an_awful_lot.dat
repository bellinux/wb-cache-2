The French challenger Sainte Marine went into the lead and set a strong pace with Lochangel among her closest pursuers. In the last quarter mile Dettori tracked {{to the right and}} Lochangel made her challenge along the stands-side rail. She overtook the French filly inside the final furlong and won by a length, with the outsiders Dashing Blue (also trined by Ian Balding), Bishops Court and Rambling Bear filling the next three places. Her win was enthusiastically received by the York crowd, many of whom had backed the filly owing to Dettori's popularity. Asked to compare the winner to her older sister, Balding said [...] "They're both super movers with devastating speed, but Lochangel <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> easier to train.

5000|$|Conversely, Peter Travers, who {{reviewed}} the film for Rolling Stone, gave it {{two and a}} half stars out of four. He felt it was [...] "a little less long and a little less boring" [...] than the first installment, and offered praise for the depiction of Smaug, saying [...] "as a digital creation, Smaug is a bloody wonder of slithering fright." [...] He was, however, very critical of the films padding of a [...] "slender novel", but concluded: [...] "Id endure another slog through Middle-Earth just to spend more time with Smaug". Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph was even less admiring, and awarded it two stars out of five. He too criticised the decision to turn Tolkiens book into three films and felt Jackson [...] "is mostly stalling for time: two or three truly great sequences tangled up in long beards and longer pit-stops." [...] He continued, writing [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of Desolation to wade through before we arrive, weary and panting, on Smaugs rocky porch," [...] and disapproved of the introduction of a love triangle to Tolkiens narrative, adding: [...] "Maybe this really is what a lot of people want to see from a film version of The Hobbit, but lets at least accept that Tolkien would probably not have been among them." [...] The New York Posts Lou Lumenick was extremely negative in his 1.5/4 star review and he compared it to Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, and remarked [...] "There are probably enough moments to satisfy hard-core fans, but for the rest of us, this amounts to the Middle Earth equivalent of “Star Wars: Episode II — Attack of the Clones,’’ a space-holding, empty-headed epic filled with characters and places (digital and otherwise) that are hard to keep straight, much less care about." ...|$|E

The heroes have to play mummy and daddy." [...] Despite this, Tamly considers this adventure to be [...] "an awful lot better than Secret Wars I. To start with, although there are potentially even more heroes involved, you don't have to play them all at once. Only at the end do the numbers get ridiculous. And there is quite a bit of plot to it, much of it the interesting psychological stuff. You can't out-fight The Beyonder, so you have to out-talk him. Your players should be utterly shell-shocked by the time they finish this." [...] He complains, [...] "as the SWII plot ran for almost a year and crossed over into almost every Marvel title, the chances of your having done this are not high. TSR have cut corners to keep the package down to a reasonable size, but not having character pictures for some of the new bad guys is a bit poor." [...] Tamlyn concludes: [...] "Because of its structure and basis in a particular comic story you have to be running an MSH campaign to use this. It is a must for MSG addicts because of the new characters and the map, though even they might find it too heavy to use. Anyone else, forget it." ...|$|E

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} found that {{patients}} have expressed favourable attitudes towards hospital settings (Weinstein, 1979) but more recently, evidence from service user feedback has indicated the experience of psychiatric admission can be felt to be neither safe nor therapeutic (Department of Health, 2002). There has been lack of qualitative research exploring individuals’ experiences of psychiatric admission in the context of acute psychosis. Aims: The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the experience and perceptions of psychiatric admission for individuals with psychosis using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Method: Five participants with psychosis who were currently admitted to a psychiatric ward were interviewed using a semi-structured interview. Results: Three super ordinate themes emerged, which were labelled: “I feel like a, a prisoner in here…”, “‘ [...] my life is in their hands [...] ” and “There <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of stigma put on mental health patients [...] . ” Conclusions: The emergent themes suggested individuals felt imprisoned, disempowered and experienced a sense of loss due to their admission but also due to their experiences of psychosis. This was also accompanied by a lack of awareness and understanding from others, which resulted in feelings of stigma but acceptance within hospital. The themes are discussed in relation to previous research and current Government and National Health Service (NHS) initiatives. Declaration of interest: Non...|$|E
