25|$|Several forms (vitamers) {{of vitamin}} D exist. The two major forms are vitamin D2 or <b>ergocalciferol,</b> and vitamin D3 or cholecalciferol; vitamin D without a {{subscript}} refers to either D2 or D3 or both. These are known collectively as calciferol. Vitamin D2 was chemically characterized in 1931. In 1935, the chemical structure of vitamin D3 was established and proven {{to result from}} the ultraviolet irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D2, or <b>ergocalciferol</b> {{is found}} in fungus (except alfalfa which is a plantae) and created from viosterol, {{which in turn is}} created when {{ultraviolet}} light activates ergosterol (which {{is found in}} fungi and named as a sterol from ergot). Any UV-irradiated fungus including yeast form vitamin D2. Human bioavailability of vitamin D2 from vitamin D2-enhanced button mushrooms via UV-B irradiation is effective in improving vitamin D status and not different from a vitamin D2 supplement according to study. For example, Vitamin D2 from UV-irradiated yeast baked into bread is bioavailable.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D {{comes in}} two forms. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is {{synthesized}} {{in the skin}} after exposure to the sun, or consumed {{in the form of}} animal products; when produced industrially it is taken from lanolin in sheep's wool. <b>Ergocalciferol</b> (vitamin D2) is derived from ergosterol from UV-exposed mushrooms or yeast and is suitable for vegans. Conflicting studies have suggested that the two forms {{may or may not be}} bioequivalent. According to researchers from the Institute of Medicine, the differences between vitamins D2 and D3 do not affect metabolism, both function as prohormones, and when activated exhibit identical responses in the body.|$|E
2500|$|Vitamin D {{refers to}} a group of fat-soluble secosteroids {{responsible}} for increasing intestinal absorption of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, and multiple other biological effects. [...] In humans, the most important compounds in this group are vitamin D3 (also known as cholecalciferol) and vitamin D2 (<b>ergocalciferol).</b> [...] Cholecalciferol and <b>ergocalciferol</b> can be ingested from the diet and from supplements. [...] Only a few foods contain vitamin D. [...] The major natural source of the vitamin is synthesis of cholecalciferol in the skin from cholesterol through a chemical reaction that is dependent on sun exposure (specifically UVB radiation). Dietary recommendations typically assume that all of a person's vitamin D is from taken by mouth, as sun exposure in the population is variable and recommendations about the amount of sun exposure that is safe are uncertain in view of the skin cancer risk.|$|E
2500|$|Vitamin D {{from the}} diet or skin {{synthesis}} is biologically inactive; enzymatic conversion (hydroxylation) {{in the liver}} and kidney is required for activation. [...] As vitamin D can be synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sufficient sunlight, {{it is not an}} essential dietary factor, and so not technically a vitamin. [...] Instead it could be considered as a hormone, with activation of the vitamin D pro-hormone resulting in the active form, calcitriol, which then produces effects via a nuclear receptor in multiple different locations. [...] Cholecalciferol is converted in the liver to calcifediol (25-hydroxycholecalciferol); <b>ergocalciferol</b> is converted to 25-hydroxyergocalciferol. [...] These two vitamin D metabolites (called 25-hydroxyvitamin D or 25(OH)D) are measured in serum to determine a person's vitamin D status. [...] Calcifediol is further hydroxylated by the kidneys to form calcitriol (also known as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol), the biologically active form of vitamin D. Calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the blood, having a major role regulating the concentration of calcium and phosphate, and promoting the healthy growth and remodeling of bone. Calcitriol also has other effects, including some on cell growth, neuromuscular and immune functions, and reduction of inflammation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ergocalciferol</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1936.

50|$|<b>Ergocalciferol</b> {{may be used}} as a vitamin D supplement, and a 2011 {{clinical}} guideline considered <b>ergocalciferol</b> to be {{as effective}} as cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) which is produced naturally by the skin when exposed to ultraviolet light.|$|E

50|$|The main adverse drug {{reaction}} {{associated with}} calcitriol therapy is hypercalcemia - early symptoms include: nausea, vomiting, constipation, anorexia, apathy, headache, thirst, pruritus, sweating, and/or polyuria. Compared to other vitamin D compounds in clinical use (cholecalciferol, <b>ergocalciferol),</b> calcitriol has {{a higher risk of}} inducing hypercalcemia.

50|$|Calciferols (vitamins D), {{cholecalciferol}} (vitamin D3) and <b>ergocalciferol</b> (vitamin D2) {{are used}} as rodenticides. They are toxic to rodents {{for the same reason}} they are important to humans: they affect calcium and phosphate homeostasis in the body. Vitamins D are essential in minute quantities (few IUs per kilogram body weight daily, only a fraction of a milligram), and like most fat soluble vitamins, they are toxic in larger doses, causing hypervitaminosis. If the poisoning is severe enough (that is, if the dose of the toxin is high enough), it leads to death. In rodents that consume the rodenticidal bait, it causes hypercalcemia, raising the calcium level, mainly by increasing calcium absorption from food, mobilising bone-matrix-fixed calcium into ionised form (mainly monohydrogencarbonate calcium cation, partially bound to plasma proteins, CaHCO3+), which circulates dissolved in the blood plasma. After ingestion of a lethal dose, the free calcium levels are raised sufficiently that blood vessels, kidneys, the stomach wall and lungs are mineralised/calcificated (formation of calcificates, crystals of calcium salts/complexes in the tissues, damaging them), leading further to heart problems (myocardial tissue is sensitive to variations of free calcium levels, affecting both myocardial contractibility and excitation propagation between atrias and ventriculas), bleeding (due to capillary damage) and possibly kidney failure. It is considered to be single-dose, cumulative (depending on concentration used; the common 0.075% bait concentration is lethal to most rodents after a single intake of larger portions of the bait) or sub-chronic (death occurring usually within days to one week after ingestion of the bait). Applied concentrations are 0.075% cholecalciferol and 0.1% <b>ergocalciferol</b> when used alone, which can kill a rodent or a rat.|$|E
5000|$|Vitamin D {{is mainly}} {{found in the}} body in two forms: vitamin D3 and vitamin D2. Vitamin D3, or cholecalciferol, is formed in the skin after {{exposure}} to sunlight or ultra violet radiation. Vitamin D2, or <b>ergocalciferol,</b> is obtained from various food sources including milk and fish. [...] These two forms of vitamin D are metabolized in the liver and stored as 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Before biological use, the storage form must be converted into an active form. One common active form is 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D. [...] The term vitamin D in this article, refers to group of molecules including cholecalciferol,ergocalciferol, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and the active forms. The role of vitamin D is best characterized as enabling calcium absorption and regulating calcium homeostasis. Vitamin D {{also play a role}} in phosphate absorption.|$|E
50|$|Household pets such as {{dogs and}} cats are found to develop hypercalcemia. It is less common in cats, and many feline cases are idiopathic. In dogs, lymphosarcoma, addison’s disease, primary hyperparathyroidism, and chronic renal failure are the main causes of hypercalcemia, {{but there are also}} {{environmental}} causes usually unique to indoor pets. Ingestion of small amounts of calcipotriene found in psoriasis cream can be fatal to a pet. Calcipotriene causes a rapid rise in calcium ion levels. Calcium ion levels can remain high for weeks if untreated and lead to an array of medical issues. There are also cases of hypercalcemia reported due to dogs ingesting rodenticides containing a chemical similar to calcipotriene found in psoriasis cream. Additionally, ingestion of household plants is a cause of hypercalcemia. Plants such as Cestrum diurnum, and Solanum malacoxylon contain <b>ergocalciferol</b> or cholecalciferol which cause the onset of hypercalcemia. Consuming small amounts of these plants can be fatal to pets. Observable symptoms may develop such as polydipsia, polyuria, extreme fatigue, or constipation.|$|E
