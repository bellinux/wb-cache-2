50|$|The Figure Geo Warping Grid {{depicts the}} {{solution}} to the problem. The circular radar coverage area is divided into a circular grid. Only the corner points of the grid are geo warped which drastically reduces the computation time. Coordinates within a grid tile are computed by a weighted bilinear interpolation of the grid corner points.As geographical projections are typically non-linear functions this introduces a certain error for the radar video <b>display</b> <b>position.</b> Keeping this error sufficiently below the radar measurement resolution makes sure that this is no restriction for the radar video display quality. The grid tile size has to be computed once for a radar position and a given projection. Thus, the grid is typically computed once for a static radar and only more often for moving radars e.g. on ships.|$|E

50|$|Scorpion uses a novel {{optical system}} {{featuring}} a light-guide optical element (LOE) {{which provides a}} compact color collimated image to the pilot.

A visor can be deployed {{in front of the}} display providing protection during ejection. The visor can be clear, glare, high contrast, gradient, or laser protective. An NVG mount can be installed in place of the visor during flight. Once installed, NVGs can be placed in front of the display, thus allowing the pilot to view both the display symbols as well as the NVG image simultaneously.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Effects {{of display}} size and dual display setting on {{preferred}} display and keyboard positions were evaluated. Background: User-preferred <b>display</b> <b>position</b> may vary as its size changes or when multiple displays are used. It {{is also not}} known whether the use of larger displays or multiple displays would influence positioning of the keyboard. Method: Participants (N = 19) who had normal visual acuity (20 / 30 or better) determined preferred positions of the display and the keyboard during a data entry task in four display setups (19, 24, 27. 5, and dual 19 in.). The size of capital characters (3. 2 mm high) was kept consistent between setups. Results: Preferred viewing distance ranged from 0. 68 m (19 -in. display) to 0. 76 m (27. 5 -in. display). No significant differences in viewing distance and display height {{were found between the}} single 19 -in. display and dual 19 -in. displays setups. The preferred position of the keyboard was consistent between display setups. Conclusion: Participants placed larger displays farther and lower while maintaining the display top at or near eye height. Preferred position of the dual displays in landscape setting did not differ from that of a single display. It appears that the preferred <b>display</b> <b>position</b> varies with the vertical dimension of the overall viewable area of the display. Application: The results of this study can be used to determine the dimensions or adjustability of computer workstations for larger displays or multiple displays settings. close 6...|$|E
40|$|In-vehicle {{computing}} {{and communications}} devices typically present {{a range of}} information to the driver via a visual display located within the vehicle. The optimum location for such a display has been addressed in research focusing on peripheral detection, that is, what drivers can see (and respond to) whilst glancing towards displays located in different positions. This paper argues that {{it is also important}} to understand how and when drivers make use of a display in real world tasks (the behavioural questions). A road-based study is described, in which twelve participants drove three unfamiliar urban routes using an existing navigation system, with the display located in either a high, middle or low central position within the vehicle (approximately 10 °, 20 ° or 30 ° vertical eccentricities below eye-line height, respectively). The study found that, regardless of the location of the display, drivers spent a similar proportion of journey time glancing towards it. However, glances made towards the low display were of longer duration than those made towards the display in the higher positions, although less glances were made. Furthermore, the low <b>display</b> <b>position</b> forced drivers into actions such as taking one hand off the steering wheel, and having to adopt uncomfortable postures to view the display. Although a similar number of navigational errors occurred across the three conditions, analysis of the error types indicated that <b>display</b> <b>position</b> could either exacerbate or moderate problems experienced with the navigation system’s user-interface...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In recent years, as {{information}} materials become increasingly multimedia, {{we are having}} more and more opportunities to construct {{and take advantage of}} learning aid systems that introduce multimedia by utilizing various visually and acoustically effective methods for individual learning and teaching aids. Today, many learning systems under development have screen designs dependant upon experiences and senses. It is pointed out that learning systems are not effective since their screen designs do not properly deal with human sensation and information processing capability. In this study, we will examine effective learning aid system screen designs by conducting experiments on the <b>displayed</b> <b>position</b> and the amount of information in the learning aid system. As a conclusion, it was revealed that the first position in which learning is started is the upper left and the position in which learning is repeated is the middle center, and that those <b>displayed</b> <b>positions</b> are proven to have a high learning effectiveness. It was also found that learning effectiveness declined in a learning environment where long text is presented by screen separation or scrolling...|$|R

40|$|At night, the {{visibility}} is reduced {{and the demands}} on the driver increase. A safety system that enables the driver to discover warmer objects in the surroundings when {{the visibility}} are reduced, such as the Vision Enhancement System (VES) contributes to safer night-time driving. Since the benefits of this system are established, it is of interest to investigate different design aspects. The VES display has in earlier studies been positioned {{in front of the}} driver but different display positions such as peripheral placement should be evaluated. The present simulator study is an investigation of the effects of different display positions inside the car. Two different display positions were investigated, in front of the driver and {{to the right of the}} driver. When driving with a display positioned to the right, the driver will have to divide his attention between the road scene and the display by turning his head or he might be able to use peripheral vision. It was hypothesised that there would be significant differences in driving performance between the two display positions in favour of the <b>display</b> <b>position</b> above the steering wheel. The results were measured in driving performance as well as opinions from the participants. Results show that there were some significant differences and several tendencies of better driving performance when driving with the display in front of the driver. The participants also rated this display as being better positioned and effecting the driving in a more positive way than the display to the right. It was therefore concluded that that the most preferred <b>display</b> <b>position</b> is in front of the driver...|$|E
