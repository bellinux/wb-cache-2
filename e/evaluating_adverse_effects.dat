40|$|Collinearity amongst {{covariates}} in {{linear regression}} models {{has long been}} recognised as a potential source of bias. Various `solutions' have been proposed, though one issue almost entirely omitted in the current literature {{is the importance of}} the relationship between the outcome and the correlated covariates.   Using vector geometry, it can be shown that the impact of collinearity on the model, such as changes in regression coefficients, cannot be judged by the correlation structure of the covariates alone-their relationship with the outcome is crucial. Traditional diagnostics of collinearity are thus insufficient in <b>evaluating</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> or model instability. Collinearity diagnostics should play an important role in assessing this impact, both adverse and beneficial, on model parameters. The objective of this study was to build a new index that measures the impact of collinearity in the model environment, rather than providing only a description of the feature. Vector geometry was used to design a measure that accounts for the relationship between the outcome and the correlated covariates-labelled the D-index. The D-index was implemented as part of a regression study to develop a parsimonious model for body fat using easily obtainable body circumference measurements. The covariates were selected based on the degree of collinearity amongst the predictors in the model and the variance explained in the response. Such a model would potentially allow for a reduction in the number of body size measurements required, reducing study length and cost, whilst maintaining measurements that most accurately represent total body fat...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to <b>evaluate</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> of multiwalled carbon {{nanotubes}} (MWCNT), produced for industrial purposes, on the human epithelial cell line A 549. MWCNT were dispersed in dipalmitoyl lecithin (DPL), a component of pulmonary surfactant, and the effects of dispersion in DPL were compared to those in two other media: ethanol (EtOH) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Effects of MWCNT were also compared to those of two asbestos fibers (chrysotile and crocidolite) and carbon black (CB) nanoparticles, not only in A 549 cells but also in mesothelial cells (MeT 5 A human cell line), used as an asbestos-sensitive cell type. MWCNT formed agglomerates on top of both cell lines (surface area 15 - 35 microm(2)) that were significantly larger and more numerous in PBS than in EtOH and DPL. Whatever the dispersion media, incubation with 100 microg/ml MWCNT induced a similar decrease in metabolic activity without changing cell membrane permeability or apoptosis. Neither MWCNT cellular internalization nor oxidative stress was observed. In contrast, asbestos fibers penetrated into the cells, decreased metabolic activity but not cell membrane permeability, and increased apoptosis, without decreasing cell number. CB was internalized without any <b>adverse</b> <b>effects.</b> In conclusion, this study demonstrates that MWCNT produced for industrial purposes exert <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> without being internalized by human epithelial and mesothelial pulmonary cell lines...|$|R

40|$|Advanced {{magnetic}} resonance imaging techniques, such as proton {{magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy (H-MRS), have helped to further understanding of the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and {{to shed light on}} mechanisms underlying the therapeutic response. Potential complications of MDD therapy constitute an important area of research. Interruption of the absorption of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is associated with discontinuation syndrome, while electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can lead to transient and persistent anterograde amnesia. This paper reviews studies, since 1994, that have used H-MRS to <b>evaluate</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> and complications of MDD treatment, either with ECT or SSRIs. Three articles have been published on <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> and complications of MDD treatment and H-MRS. Two focused on the ECT-induced memory deterioration and showed no sign of hippocampal atrophy in MDD patients with a residual memory deterioration after ECT, but a significant mean increase of the signal from Cho-containing compounds bilaterally, possibly due to an alteration of membrane turnover in the hippocampal region. The third paper showed that placebo-day Cho/Cr metabolite ratios were decreased in subjects with discontinuation syndrome, a finding that possibly reflects the dynamics of rostral anterior cingulate function. In spite of the limits deriving from the small number of papers published, our review demonstrated that H-MRS could be a useful instrument not only in evaluating therapy efficacy, but also for offering new insights into mechanisms underlying MDD treatment...|$|R

However, there are few agents currently approved for the treatment of obesity. Those that are available are mainly appetite suppressants and gastrointestinal fat blockers. We have developed a simple and rapid method for the measurement of the feeding volume of Danio rerio (zebrafish). This assay can be used to screen appetite suppressants and enhancers. In this study, zebrafish were fed viable paramecia that were fluorescently-labeled, and feeding volume was measured using a 96 -well microplate reader. Gene expression analysis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf), knockdown of appetite-regulating genes (neuropeptide Y, preproinsulin, melanocortin 4 receptor, agouti related protein, and cannabinoid receptor 1), and the administration of clinical appetite suppressants (fluoxetine, sibutramine, mazindol, phentermine, and rimonabant) revealed the similarity among mechanisms regulating appetite in zebrafish and mammals.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the methods used to <b>evaluate</b> the potential <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> of underwater sound from impact pile driving on the marbled murrelet (a seabird that is federally listed as threatened), and to introduce measures that have successfully minimized <b>adverse</b> <b>effects.</b> The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service has evaluated the effects of pile driving on the marbled murrelet through several recent Endangered Species Act consultations. Over the past few years, there has been increased attention to the potential for impact pile driving to adversely affect fish species. When foraging, marbled murrelets dive in pursuit of prey and can be exposed to the same elevated sound pressure levels that adversely affect fish. Exposure to these sounds could result in mortality, injury, and/or modification of normal behaviors. Marbled murrelets forage in the marine waters throughout Puget Sound. Recent transportation projects that have occurred in Puget Sound include replacement of the Hood Canal Floating Bridge and multiple Washington State Ferry terminal-maintenance and preservation projects. These projects typically use 36 -inch and 24 -inch hollow steel piles. Impact installation of these piles can produce sound pressure levels of 210 dB peak. Physical injury, including death, may occur in aquatic organisms at sound-pressure levels above 180 dB peak. Sound-pressure levels above 153 dBrms are expected to cause temporary behavioral changes that may negatively affect foraging efficiency. These projects were evaluated by determining the area where sound pressure was expected to exceed the above levels and then estimating the potential for marbled murrelets to be exposed to those sound-pressure levels. When exposure was likely to occur, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service anticipated <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> in the form of harm (physical injury) and harassment (modification of normal behavior patterns). Minimization measures focused on reducing that potential exposure. Sound-attenuation devices (bubble curtains) were used to reduce the extent of the geographic area where <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> could occur. A hazing program was used to move murrelets out of the area where physical injury was expected. We present the analysis used to <b>evaluate</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> to marbled murrelets from pile driving, discuss the method used to estimate the extent of effects, and introduce measures to minimize <b>adverse</b> <b>effects.</b> Finally, we recommend future research needed to better understand and to reduce further these impacts...|$|R

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to <b>evaluate</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> of {{ultraviolet}} irradiation (UV) in atopic dermatitis (AD). We focused on the two important <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> of UV: photosensitivity and skin cancer risk associated with calcineurin inhibitor treatment. In chapter 2 and 3 we found that photosensitivity affects approximately 3 % of our AD population, being mainly females. Phototesting distinguishes two photosensitivity reaction patterns. Based hereupon, patients were diagnosed with photosensitive AD (PhAD) or AD with co-existing polymorphic light eruption (AD + PLE). Children with AD and photosensitivity showed the same two clinical reaction patterns as demonstrated in adults in the same 50 - 50 % ratio. In chapter 4, we analyzed the inflammatory cell infiltrate after a single UVB irradiation in these two patient groups compared to non-photosensitive AD patients. There {{was no difference between}} the 3 groups concerning the influx of neutrophils, eosinophils and T-cells, the degranulation of mast cells or the quantity of epidermal dendritic cells. In chapter 5 we described a digital quantification method for immunohistochemical assessment of UV induced thymine cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (TT-CPDs) in human skin. This method increased the linear measurement range compared to visual assessment and hence improved immunohistochemical quantification of DNA photo damage; it is more sensitive and efficient in measuring the extent of DNA-damage per nucleus. This method was eventually used to assess the difference in UV induced DNA damage repair in AD patients treated with either topical triamcinolone acetonide 0, 1 % ointment (classic corticosteroid) or tacrolimus 0, 1 % ointment (calcineurin inhibitor) described in chapter 6. Our study did not show differences in DNA damage repair rate of topical tacrolimus treated skin after a single UVB irradiation in human AD skin compared to non-treated or triamcinolone treated skin...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{compare the}} effects of {{intravenous}} hyoscine butylbromide versus placebo on the duration of labor in term pregnancies. Materials and methods 86 patients were selected and randomly assigned to receive intravenous hyoscine butylbromide (20 mg twice) (n= 43) or an intravenous placebo (saline solution 10 cc) (n= 43). We <b>evaluated</b> maternal <b>adverse</b> <b>effects,</b> effects on neonatal Apgar score, cervical dilatation 1 h after drug administration and the interval between the onset of labor and delivery. ResultsNo significant differences were observed in the duration of phases of labor between the two groups. No {{significant differences were found}} between the groups in Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min. No maternal <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> were observed or reported due to the use of hyoscine butylbromide or the placebo. On the first phase of primigravidas it shortens the first labor phase up to 159. 1 ± 84 min vs. the control group (p= 0. 002). ConclusionHyoscine butylbromide oxytocin shortens the duration of labor in term primigravida pregnancies. No side effects were reported...|$|R

40|$|Because of {{limitations}} on conducting exposure experiments us-ing human subjects to <b>evaluate</b> <b>adverse</b> health <b>effects,</b> the deposi-tion and fate of airborne particles in animals are often studied. The results of such studies are extrapolated to humans to estimate equivalent dose and subsequent response. In this article, particle inhalability and respiratory deposition of micron-size particles are determined for female Long-Evans rats. Monodisperse aerosols were generated from {{a solution of}} radiolabeled iron chloride (59 FeCl 3). Long-Evans rats {{were exposed to the}} radiolabeled par-ticles in a Cannon nose-only exposure tower to determine head, lung lobar, and total lung deposition fractions. Particle deposition fractions in a hypothetical situation, when all particles are inhal-able, were found from an experimentally validated deposition model. Particle inhalability in a Cannon nose-only exposure sce-nario was obtained by comparing the measured deposition frac...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: We {{sought to}} {{identify}} the proportion of systematic reviews of <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> which search for unpublished data and the success rates of identifying unpublished data for inclusion in a systematic review. Study Design and Setting: Two reviewers independently screened all records published in 2014 in the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) for systematic reviews where the primary aim was to <b>evaluate</b> an <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> or effects. Data were extracted on the types of <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> and interventions <b>evaluated,</b> sources searched, how many unpublished studies were included, and source or type of unpublished data included. Results: From 9, 129 DARE abstracts, 348 met our inclusion criteria. Most of these reviews evaluated a drug intervention (237 / 348, 68 %) with specified <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> (250 / 348, 72 %). Over a third (136 / 348, 39 %) of all the reviews searched, a specific source for unpublished data, such as conference abstracts or trial registries, and nearly half of these reviews (65 / 136, 48 %) included unpublished data. An additional 13 reviews included unpublished data despite not searching specific sources for unpublished studies. Overall, 22 % (78 / 348) of reviews included unpublished data/studies. Conclusion: Most reviews of <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> do not search specifically for unpublished data but, of those that do, nearly half are successful...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial translocation/Acute {{radiation}} syndrome/Endotoxin/G-CSF/OK- 432 Acute radiation induces bacterial translocation {{from the}} gut, followed by systemic infection and sepsis. In {{order to reduce}} the mortality after acute whole body irradiation, it is essential to control bacte-rial translocation. In this study, we established a bacterial translocation assay as a sensitive method to detect minor mucosal injury by radiation. By utilizing this assay, we <b>evaluated</b> the <b>adverse</b> <b>effects,</b> if any, of hematopoietic reagents on the mucosal integrity in the respiratory and gastro-intestinal tracts. Bacterial translocation to the liver and spleen occurred after whole-body irradiation if the dose exceeded 6 Gy. The administration of G-CSF unexpectedly increased the bacterial translocation in 8 Gy-irradiated mice. The pharmaceutical preparation of low-virulent Streptococcus pyogenes, OK- 432, significantly re-duced the endotoxin levels in peripheral blood without any reduction of bacterial translocation. A com-bined treatment with G-CSF and OK- 432 decreased bacterial translocation and prevented death. This result indicates that the early administration of G-CSF has an <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> on bacterial translocation, and that a combined treatment of G-CSF and OK- 432 attenuates the <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> of G-CSF and im-proves the survival rate after acute irradiation...|$|R
