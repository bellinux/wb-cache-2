The impact on Tikopia was much greater; agricultural productivity on the island {{was said to have}} been wiped out. Fruit trees were estimated only to begin producing fruit again at least two years after Zoe's impact. Topsoil was left dry by the cyclone, preventing any <b>immediate</b> <b>replacement</b> of lost crops.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{determined that}} it did not need to go ahead with an <b>immediate</b> <b>replacement</b> for the Canberra and preferred Hancock's original choice of the TFX as a long-term solution, leading to the Menzies government's announcement on 24 October that it was ordering 24 F-111s for US$125 million, enough for two squadrons. The announcement came during the campaigning for the 1963 general election. Calwell's Labor party had on 22 October reiterated its pre-campaign promise that it would replace the Canberras as soon as it formed a government. The government's announcement, and the consequent improvement of its chances against Labor, likely also benefited the United States; the purchase helped rebut American critics of the TFX, and the Kennedy administration preferred Menzies' defence policies to the opposition's. The contract was signed the following year through the U.S. Department of Defense. The British government's cancellation of the TSR-2 in April 1965 showed that Australia's decision to not order it was correct.|$|E
5|$|In January 1942 it {{was decided}} that the limit of {{long-range}} aircraft endurance should be the crew’s limits, (due to extreme aircrew fatigue seriously effecting efficiency) not the fuel supply of the aircraft. De la Ferté decided, on 7 January, sorties should not exceed 14 hours, which reduced flying hours by four per mission. This was despite the entry of the very long-range Liberators in June 1941. The Liberator Mk I had a stated Air Ministry range of 2,720 miles, but crew endurance methods now meant it would be airborne for just 2,240. De la Ferté wrote to the Ministry arguing the Liberator should be used for reconnaissance work, rather than bomb load for the solitary squadron being accepted at that time. The Liberator would assist in closing the 'Mid-Atlantic Gap' which U-boats could operate in without worrying about air interdiction. After replacing Bowhill in 1941, de la Ferté had issued a directive on 12 June 1941 to use Wellingtons and Whitleys as an interim solution to unrestricted submarine warfare now practised by the Germans. Their uneconomical operational cost meant <b>immediate</b> <b>replacement</b> of these medium-range machines was pressing. Some Avro Lancasters and Halifaxes, with some difficulty, were seconded from Bomber Command.|$|E

5|$|At {{the meeting}} the RSK {{insisted on the}} {{withdrawal}} of the HV from western Slavonia and the gradual implementation of a ceasefire, followed by economic cooperation before a political settlement was discussed. The Croatian delegation did not intend to negotiate, but to prepare diplomatically for a military resolution of the war. Stoltenberg proposed a seven-point compromise, including negotiations based on the Z-4 Plan, beginning on 10 August. The proposal was initially accepted by Babić, who then expressed reservations about the Z-4 Plan as a political settlement when he was asked to publicly declare support for the Stoltenberg proposal (so the Novaković delegation would follow his lead). Pašalić then asked Novaković to accept Croatia's seven demands, including <b>immediate</b> <b>replacement</b> of the RSK with a Croatian civilian government. Novaković refused Pašalić's proposal, indicating that he accepted the Stoltenberg proposal instead, and Pašalić declared that the RSK had declined a Croatian offer to negotiate. Croatia did not consider Babić powerful enough to secure support for an initiative from Martić, and thus unable to commit the RSK to an agreement. This view was supported by Babić himself, who told Galbraith during their 2 August meeting in Belgrade that Martić would only obey Milošević. On 4 August Croatia launched Operation Storm against the RSK and, according to Galbraith, effectively terminated the Z-4 Plan and its associated political process.|$|E

The organization brought in Zarko Brala to manage the squad for the 2002 season. Throughout the majority of the season Brala managed to compete with the Mississauga Olympians for the Conference title, but was discharged from his post on September 9, 2002. The reasoning for his dismissal was regarding his coaching decisions during the teams defeat in the annual Croatian-North American Soccer Tournament, where he inserted his son back-up goalkeeper Anthony Brala into the starting line-up instead of George Azcurra. His decision caused a negative reaction from the Croatian community, which prompted team president Mario Skara to relive him of his duties. His <b>immediate</b> <b>replacement</b> was former head coach Drago Santic, who captured the Puma League title in 1996 for Croatia. Under the guidance of Santic the team managed to clinch the Western Conference title, and achieved a six game undefeated streak.

500|$|As CAS, Hancock {{worked to}} enhance the RAAF's {{deterrent}} capability in the Pacific region, {{particularly in light of}} heightened tensions with Indonesia during its period of Konfrontasi with Malaysia.

After investigating the US [...] "TFX", North American A-5 Vigilante and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, the British BAC TSR-2, and the French Dassault Mirage IV, Hancock decided that the swing-wing TFX, forerunner of the General Dynamics F-111, would be the aircraft best suited for this role. However, as the TFX had not yet flown, he recommended purchase of the already operational Vigilante to counteract a perceived imminent threat from Indonesia. In the event, the Federal Government did not go ahead with an <b>immediate</b> <b>replacement</b> for the Canberra, and Hancock's original choice of the TFX was taken up as a long-term solution, leading to Australia's agreement in October to purchase the F-111C.

40|$|The {{mesosphere}} is {{an altitude}} {{region of the}} atmosphere, covering altitudes between about 50 km to 100 km. Improved understanding of {{this area of the}} atmosphere offers possibilities of increasing the accuracy of weather forecast and climate models. Continuous measurements at these altitudes are difficult as neither balloon nor airplanes can reach such heights. However, by remotely measuring thermal emission emitted in the microwave region, properties such as the atmospheric temperature and the abundance of species such as water vapour and ozone, can be determined from instruments placed on the ground or on satellites. In this thesis microwave spectroscopy is used to measure carbon monoxide above the Onsala Space Observatory located south of Gothenburg, Sweden. The results of the measurements are compared to, and found in good agreement with, co-located data from satellite instruments. A new inversion technique is also demonstrated which integrates the temporal averaging of spectra directly into the retrieval. This shows that ground-based microwave instruments are well suited for mesospheric monitoring, which will become more important in the future as many of the satellite instruments used in the comparison are slated for retirement, with no <b>immediate</b> <b>replacements</b> planned. Microwave spectroscopy can also be used in studies related to polar mesospheric clouds. These are clouds that form in the uppermost part of the summer mesosphere and are extremely sensitive to temperature changes in the background atmosphere.

30|$|Single <b>immediate</b> implant <b>replacement</b> is {{accompanied}} by excellent survival rates and a favorable esthetic outcome. The objective of this report was to describe a surgical approach for removal of a buccal or palatally located impacted secondary canine, combined with extraction of the failing primary canine, and immediate placement and provisionalization of an implant. A window technique was applied for surgical removal of the impacted canine. The alveolar crest was preserved. After extraction of the primary canine, the implant was inserted with primary stability. Finally, the exposed surfaces of the implant were covered with a 1 : 1 mixture of autologous bone and Bio-Oss®. At the 1 -year evaluation, both implants were successfully osseointegrated and in function. Esthetics were excellent. It is concluded that under premise of preservation of sufficient bone to achieve primary stability of the implant, removal of the canines can be combined with immediate placement and provisionalization of the implant.|$|R
