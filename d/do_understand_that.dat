6000|$|This is a frank biographer, and {{an honest}} one; she uses no sand-paper on me. I have, to this day, the same dull {{head in the}} matter of conundrums and perplexities which Susy had {{discovered}} in those long-gone days.

I cannot get far in the reading of the commonest and simplest contract--with its [...] "parties of the first part," [...] and [...] "parties of the second part," [...] and [...] "parties of the third part,"--before my temper is all gone. Ashcroft comes up here every day and pathetically tries to make me understand the points of the lawsuit which we are conducting against Henry Butters, Harold Wheeler, and the rest of those Plasmon buccaneers, but daily he has to give it up. It is pitiful to see, when he bends his earnest and appealing eyes upon me and says, after one of his efforts, [...] "Now you <b>do</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that,</b> don't you?" ...|$|E
60|$|The first letter, from Dudley, at Windsor 'this 9th day of September in the evening,' {{proves that}} Blount, early on September 9, {{the day after}} Amy's death, went from Leicester, at Windsor, towards Berkshire. He had not long gone when Bowes (a {{retainer}} of Leicester, of Forster, or of Amy) brought to Dudley the fatal news. 'By him I <b>do</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> my wife is dead and, as he saith, by a fall {{from a pair of}} stairs. Little other understanding can I have from him.' Throughout the correspondence Leicester does not utter one word of sorrow for Amy, as, had the letters been written for exhibition, he would almost certainly have done. The fear of his own danger and disgrace alone inspires him, and he takes every measure to secure a full, free, and minute examination. 'Have no respect to any living person.' A coroner's jury is to be called, the body is to be examined; Appleyard and others of Amy's kin have already been sent for to go to Cumnor.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there were}} {{debates about the}} apocalypse itself, few people {{actually}} understood the consequences {{of what would happen}} if the apocalypse occurred. Unfortunately few documents from around the year 1000 exist to actually interpret what people thought would happen, and because of this many scholars are unaware of what people actually felt. People <b>do</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> the idea of apocalypticism has influenced several Western Christian European leaders into social reform.|$|E
50|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, many historians claimed that Celsus {{believed}} that the crystalline lens is in the exact center of the eye.

5000|$|In a February 2014 broadcast, Hansen {{delivered}} a commentary supporting NFL draft candidate Michael Sam coming {{out as a}} gay man. He contrasted Sam's homosexuality making players [...] "uncomfortable", with criminal activity by other NFL players which is routinely condoned, and likened contemporary discomfort with gay players to white athletes' and fans' past discomfort with black players. He concluded saying, [...] "I'm not always comfortable when a man tells me he is gay; I don't understand his world. But I <b>do</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> {{he is part of}} mine." ...|$|E

Everyone's on the same page, morality wise, and their fighting skills are, for far, unrivaled. Which is why it's frustrating to see them get cut in half and split off into two separate storylines at the end. I <b>do</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> the show can't realistically handle such a giant ensemble always being together in one spot, but I just wish I'd bought more into {{the reasons for the}} split." ...|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{explicit}} {{language and}} sexual content, initial album pressings {{did not contain}} a Parental Advisory warning. A clean version of the album was released exclusively at Wal-Mart stores, censoring several songs for language, as well as omitting [...] "Would You Mind" [...] completely. The album was re-released in late 2001 with a Parental Advisory label, along with a new bonus track; a remix of [...] "Son of a Gun". A clean version with the added remix was also released (with [...] "Would You Mind" [...] still omitted),and became more widely available than the original clean version. Regarding the content, Jackson stated [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> for the younger audience, All for You is a pretty heavy record. For them I've made an altered version.

5000|$|Castro {{pled guilty}} on July 26, 2013, to 937 of the 977 charges against him, {{including}} charges of kidnapping, rape, and aggravated murder, {{as part of}} a plea bargain which called for consecutive sentences of life in prison plus 1,000 years, both without parole. Under the plea deal, Castro gave up his right to appeal and could not profit in any way from his crimes. He also forfeited his assets, including his home, which prosecutors said would be demolished. Castro was asked by Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Judge Michael Russo, [...] "You will not be getting out, is that clear?" [...] to which Castro responded, [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that,</b> your honor". Castro also made comments about his [...] "addiction to pornography" [...] and [...] "sexual problem", but was cut off by Judge Russo, who said such issues could be discussed at the August 1 sentencing hearing. A law firm representing Berry, DeJesus, and Knight released a statement that the three women were [...] "relieved by today's plea. They are satisfied by this resolution to the case, and are looking forward to having these legal proceedings draw to a final close in the near future".|$|E

[...] Many of her friends felt the blame was theirs, Pasternak {{felt that he had}} {{personally}} failed her. Soviet poets often preferred to blame her desperation on her fellow emigres in Paris and Berlin. Writers further west tended to view Efron's and Alya's arrest as the cause, which may have left Tsvetaeva feeling burdensome to her son. Alya blamed Mur directly. [...] There have always been rumours that Tsvetaeva's death was not suicide. On the day of her death she was home alone and it is alleged that NKVD agents came to her house and forced her to commit suicide. Kudrova in The Death of a Poet: The Last Days of Marina Tsvetaeva posits three causes for Tsvetaeva's death: that her sister Anastasia insisted that she kill herself to save her son, that she suffered from mental illness, or that she feared recruitment by the local NKVD. Tsvetaeva was buried in Yelabuga cemetery on 2 September 1941, but the exact location of her grave remains unknown.|$|E
