5|$|Enzymes {{determine}} what steps occur in these pathways. Without enzymes, metabolism would neither {{progress through the}} same steps {{and could not be}} regulated to serve the needs of the cell. Most central metabolic pathways are regulated at a few key steps, typically through enzymes whose activity involves the <b>hydrolysis</b> of ATP. Because this reaction releases so much energy, other reactions that are thermodynamically unfavorable can be coupled to ATP <b>hydrolysis,</b> driving the overall series of linked metabolic reactions.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes may use {{several of}} these {{mechanisms}} simultaneously. For example, proteases such as trypsin perform covalent catalysis using a catalytic triad, stabilise charge build-up on the transition states using an oxyanion hole, complete <b>hydrolysis</b> using an oriented water substrate.|$|E
5|$|Formulations {{containing}} {{high concentrations}} of aspirin often smell like vinegar because aspirin can decompose through <b>hydrolysis</b> in moist conditions, yielding salicylic and acetic acids.|$|E
5|$|Iron(III) {{chloride}} undergoes <b>hydrolysis</b> {{to give an}} acidic solution. When heated with iron(III) oxide at 350°C, iron(III) chloride gives iron oxychloride, a layered {{solid and}} intercalation host.|$|E
5|$|Other {{products}} of <b>hydrolysis</b> include the trimeric ion 3+. Beryllium hydroxide, Be(OH)2, is insoluble even in acidic solutions with pH less than 6, {{that is at}} biological pH. It is amphoteric and dissolves in strongly alkaline solutions.|$|E
5|$|Solutions of {{beryllium}} salts, e.g. beryllium sulfate and beryllium nitrate, are acidic {{because of}} <b>hydrolysis</b> of the 2+ ion.|$|E
5|$|The 19S {{particle}} in eukaryotes {{consists of}} 19 individual proteins and is divisible into two subassemblies, a 9-subunit base that binds {{directly to the}} α ring of the 20S core particle, and a 10-subunit lid. Six of the nine base proteins are ATPase subunits from the AAA Family, and an evolutionary homolog of these ATPases exists in archaea, called PAN (Proteasome-Activating Nucleotidase). The association of the 19S and 20S particles requires the binding of ATP to the 19S ATPase subunits, and ATP <b>hydrolysis</b> {{is required for the}} assembled complex to degrade folded and ubiquitinated proteins. Note that only the step of substrate unfolding requires energy from ATP <b>hydrolysis,</b> while ATP-binding alone can support all the other steps required for protein degradation (e.g., complex assembly, gate opening, translocation, and proteolysis). In fact, ATP binding to the ATPases by itself supports the rapid degradation of unfolded proteins. However, while ATP <b>hydrolysis</b> is required for unfolding only, it is not yet clear whether this energy may be used in the coupling of some of these steps.|$|E
5|$|The α- and γ- {{forms of}} {{scandium}} oxide hydroxide (ScO(OH)), are isostructural with their aluminium oxide hydroxide counterparts. Solutions of Sc3+ in water are acidic because of <b>hydrolysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{determine}} the equilibrium constant for this reaction, {{in which the}} ligand loses a proton, the pKa of the protonated ligand must be known. In practice, the ligand may be polyprotic; for example EDTA4− can accept four protons; in that case, all pKa values must be known. In addition, the metal ion is subject to <b>hydrolysis,</b> that is, it behaves as a weak acid, so the pK values for the <b>hydrolysis</b> reactions must also be known.|$|E
5|$|While DNA {{contains}} deoxyribose, RNA contains ribose (in deoxyribose {{there is}} no hydroxyl group attached to the pentose ring in the 2' position). These hydroxyl groups make RNA less stable than DNA {{because it is more}} prone to <b>hydrolysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|With {{protons and}} {{electrons}} from the electron transport chain, nitrogen {{is reduced to}} ammonia and free hydrogen gas. This is an energy-using process, requiring the splitting (<b>hydrolysis)</b> of ATP into ADP plus free phosphate (Pi).|$|E
5|$|A {{phosphatase}} is {{an enzyme}} that uses water to cleave a phosphoric acid monoester into a phosphate ion and an alcohol. Because a phosphatase enzyme catalyzes the <b>hydrolysis</b> of its substrate, it is a subcategory of hydrolases. Phosphatase enzymes {{are essential to}} many biological functions, because phosphorylation (e.g. by protein kinases) and dephosphorylation (by phosphatases) serve diverse roles in cellular regulation and signaling.|$|E
5|$|Argon {{is used to}} {{displace}} oxygen- and moisture-containing air in packaging material to extend the shelf-lives of the contents (argon has the European food additive code E938). Aerial oxidation, <b>hydrolysis,</b> and other chemical reactions that degrade the products are retarded or prevented entirely. High-purity chemicals and pharmaceuticals are sometimes packed and sealed in argon.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{decomposes}} {{rapidly in}} solutions of ammonium acetate or the acetates, carbonates, citrates, or hydroxides of the alkali metals. It is stable in dry air, but gradually hydrolyses {{in contact with}} moisture to acetic and salicylic acids. In solution with alkalis, the <b>hydrolysis</b> proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate.|$|E
5|$|In acidic aqueous solution, thorium {{occurs as}} the tetrapositive aqua ion 4+, which has tricapped {{trigonal}} prismatic molecular geometry: at pH<3, the solutions of thorium salts {{are dominated by}} this cation. The Th4+ ion is {{the largest of the}} tetrapositive actinide ions, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95and1.14Å. It is quite acidic due to its high charge, slightly stronger than sulfurous acid: thus it tends to undergo <b>hydrolysis</b> and polymerisation (though to a lesser extent than Fe3+), predominantly to 6+ in solutions with pH 3 or below, but in more alkaline solution polymerisation continues until the gelatinous hydroxide Th(OH)4 forms and precipitates out (though equilibrium may take weeks to be reached, because the polymerisation usually slows down before the precipitation). As a hard Lewis acid, Th4+ favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors: complexes with sulfur atoms as donors are less stable and are more prone to <b>hydrolysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Low-calorie sugars and {{artificial}} sweeteners are often made of maltodextrin with added sweeteners. Maltodextrin is an easily digestible synthetic polysaccharide consisting of short chains of glucose molecules and {{is made by}} the partial <b>hydrolysis</b> of starch. The added sweeteners are often aspartame, saccharin, stevia, or sucralose.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium has valence {{states from}} 3 to 7, {{which can be}} {{simultaneously}} observed in solutions. The most stable state in solution is +5, but the valence +4 is preferred in solid neptunium compounds. Neptunium metal is very reactive. Ions of neptunium are prone to <b>hydrolysis</b> and formation of coordination compounds.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium also {{exhibits}} valence states {{between 3 and 7}} inclusive, {{and thus}} is chemically similar to neptunium and uranium. It is highly reactive, and quickly forms an oxide film in air. Plutonium reacts with hydrogen even at temperatures as low as 25–50°C; it also easily forms halides and intermetallic compounds. <b>Hydrolysis</b> reactions of plutonium ions of different oxidation states are quite diverse. Plutonium(V) can enter polymerization reactions.|$|E
5|$|The shape {{was first}} {{isolated}} in crystal form in 2014 as Reuleaux triangle disks. Basic bismuth nitrate disks with the Reuleaux triangle shape were formed from the <b>hydrolysis</b> and precipitation of bismuth nitrate in an ethanol–water {{system in the}} presence of 2,3-bis(2-pyridyl)pyrazine.|$|E
5|$|Tin(II) chloride, {{also known}} as stannous chloride, is a white {{crystalline}} solid with the formula 2. It forms a stable dihydrate, but aqueous solutions tend to undergo <b>hydrolysis,</b> particularly if hot. SnCl2 is widely used as a reducing agent (in acid solution), and in electrolytic baths for tin-plating. Tin(II) chloride {{should not be confused}} with the other chloride of tin; tin(IV) chloride or stannic chloride (SnCl4).|$|E
5|$|When {{dissolved}} in water, iron(III) chloride undergoes <b>hydrolysis</b> and gives off heat in an exothermic reaction. The resulting brown, acidic, and corrosive solution {{is used as}} a flocculant in sewage treatment and drinking water production, and as an etchant for copper-based metals in printed circuit boards. Anhydrous iron(III) chloride is a fairly strong Lewis acid, and it {{is used as a}} catalyst in organic synthesis.|$|E
25|$|In closed systems the {{consumption}} of protons from the aqueous phase increases the pH and causes a fast transition to <b>hydrolysis.</b> However, a further saturation of solution with silica impedes <b>hydrolysis</b> and causes the glass to return to an ion-exchange, e.g. diffusion-controlled regime of corrosion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrolysis</b> {{breaks the}} glycosidic bond {{converting}} sucrose into glucose and fructose. <b>Hydrolysis</b> is, however, so slow that solutions of sucrose can sit {{for years with}} negligible change. If the enzyme sucrase is added, however, the reaction will proceed rapidly. <b>Hydrolysis</b> can also be accelerated with acids, such as cream of tartar or lemon juice, both weak acids. Likewise, gastric acidity converts sucrose to glucose and fructose during digestion, the bond between them being an acetal bond {{which can be broken}} by an acid.|$|E
25|$|Using the {{measured}} concentrations of each step, {{and the standard}} free energy changes, the actual free energy change can be calculated. (Neglecting this is very common - the delta G of ATP <b>hydrolysis</b> in cells is not the standard free energy change of ATP <b>hydrolysis</b> quoted in textbooks).|$|E
25|$|Deprotection: <b>Hydrolysis</b> using {{hydrofluoric}} acid, pyridine and tetrahydrofuran.|$|E
25|$|Dextrose, {{commercial}} glucose, {{prepared by}} the complete <b>hydrolysis</b> of starch.|$|E
25|$|Organolithium {{compounds}} {{react with}} DMF to give, after <b>hydrolysis,</b> aldehydes.|$|E
25|$|Partial <b>hydrolysis</b> gives copper oxychloride, Cu2Cl(OH)3, {{a popular}} fungicide.|$|E
25|$|The {{four key}} stages of {{anaerobic}} digestion involve <b>hydrolysis,</b> acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis.|$|E
25|$|In most cases, biomass {{is made up}} {{of large}} organic polymers. For the {{bacteria}} in anaerobic digesters to access the energy potential of the material, these chains must first be broken down into their smaller constituent parts. These constituent parts, or monomers, such as sugars, are readily available to other bacteria. The process of breaking these chains and dissolving the smaller molecules into solution is called <b>hydrolysis.</b> Therefore, <b>hydrolysis</b> of these high-molecular-weight polymeric components is the necessary first step in anaerobic digestion. Through <b>hydrolysis</b> the complex organic molecules are broken down into simple sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids.|$|E
25|$|The main {{deactivation}} {{path for}} glyphosate is <b>hydrolysis</b> to aminomethylphosphonic acid.|$|E
25|$|This is {{followed}} by purification and alkaline catalyzed <b>hydrolysis</b> of the mono-phosphonium salt.|$|E
25|$|Plants produce {{ellagic acid}} from <b>hydrolysis</b> of tannins such as {{ellagitannin}} and geraniin.|$|E
25|$|Cysteine-dependent phosphatases (CDPs) {{catalyse}} the <b>hydrolysis</b> of a phosphoester bond via a phospho-cysteine intermediate.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{minichromosome}} maintenance protein complex helicase activity, the complex also has associated ATPase activity. A mutation {{in any one}} of the six Mcm proteins reduces the conserved ATP binding sites, which indicates that ATP <b>hydrolysis</b> is a coordinated event involving all six subunits of the Mcm complex. Studies have shown that within the Mcm protein complex are specific catalytic pairs of Mcm proteins that function together to coordinate ATP <b>hydrolysis.</b> For example, Mcm3 but not Mcm6 can activate Mcm6 activity. These studies suggest that the structure for the Mcm complex is a hexamer with Mcm3 next to Mcm7, Mcm2 next to Mcm6, and Mcm4 next to Mcm5. Both members of the catalytic pair contribute to the conformation that allows ATP binding and <b>hydrolysis</b> and the mixture of active and inactive subunits create a coordinated ATPase activity that allows the Mcm protein complex to complete ATP binding and <b>hydrolysis</b> as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{metal ion}} <b>hydrolysis</b> causes ions such as 3+ {{to behave as}} weak acids: values.|$|E
