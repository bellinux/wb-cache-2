The proposed model provides an optimal schedule considering such costs in a multiple nonidentical manpower (i. e., different auditors) environment.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the {{elasticity}} of factors which influence the demand of public transport in London and Yogyakarta, based on the study of Paulley et al (2006) and the study of Sugiyanto (2007). The mode choice model between private cars and public transport (city bus) was developed based on users preferences as indicated by travel attributes. Five travel attributes were assumed to have high influences toward mode choice behavior, <b>i.</b> e; <b>travel</b> <b>cost,</b> congestion charge, <b>travel</b> time, headway of public transport (city bus), and walking time to the bus stop. The logit binomial model was used to formulate the individual behavior based on the stated preference data obtained from private car users in the Malioboro corridor.

Angling sites and participation are modeled {{as a system}} of product supplies and demands; changes in angling quality at specific sites are evaluated as changes in the supplies of relevant products. PTC assumes that each angler chooses from a selection of angling opportunities (i. e., products) based on access <b>cost</b> (<b>i.</b> e., <b>travel</b> <b>cost)</b> {{and the nature of}} each angling product. Key factors defining angling products (e. g., success rate, fish size) are derived from angler travel patterns: Anglers are assumed indifferent between sites providing identical angling products, so choose the lowest cost site. Therefore, the benefits of any management action not only differ from average welfare-change values, but are also site-specific. Changing angling attributes at a site changes its angling product: a unit of the existing product (potentially decreasing its supply) is lost while a unit of the newly created product is produced (potentially increasing its supply). Changes in supply at one site may alter angler participation patterns and the value of angling opportunities at the affected site plus at many other sites as well.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of new public transport systems can influence society in a multitude of ways, ranging from modal choices and the environment to economic growth. This paper examines the determinants of light rail mode choice for medium/long distance trips (10 - 40 km) for a new light rail system in Flanders, Belgium. To investigate these choices, the effects of various transport system specific factors (<b>i.</b> e. <b>travel</b> <b>cost,</b> in-vehicle <b>travel</b> time, transit punctuality, waiting time, access/egress time, transfers, {{and the availability of}} empty seats) as well as the travelers’ personal traits, are analyzed using an alternating logistic regression model, which explicitly takes into account the correlated responses for binary data. The data used for the analysis stem from a stated preference survey which was conducted in Flanders, Belgium. The modeling results yield findings that are in line with literature: most transport system specific factors as well as socio-economic variables, attitudinal factors, perceptions and the frequency of using public transport contribute significantly to the preference of light rail transit. In particular, it is shown that the use of light rail is strongly influenced by <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> and in-vehicle <b>travel</b> time {{and to a lesser extent}} by waiting and access/egress time. It also appeared that seat availability plays a more important role than transfers in the decision process to choose light rail transit.

40|$|This study {{develops}} {{an analytical}} dynamic mixed-equilibrium model {{to describe the}} transportation system performance with Route Planning and Guidance (RPG) services. The model considers travelers' departure time and route choices, and their propensity {{to subscribe to the}} service at different charge levels. We investigate the effect of the service charge on three parties: (i) equipped drivers; (ii) society in general; and (iii) the transportation management agency. The results show that the objectives of these parties are not always accommodative and may conflict with each other. Specifically, a numerical example illustrates that, under certain conditions, the society overall benefits from the service because all travelers are better off in terms of total generalized <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> (<b>i.</b> e., <b>travel</b> time <b>cost</b> plus schedule delay cost). The surprising result, however, is that the network may become more severely congested. This seemingly paradoxical phenomenon is due to the much lower schedule delay cost incurred by travelers with RPG services, which more than compensates for the higher travel time associated with a more congested network. These results indicate the importance of considering RPG services from a more comprehensive perspective. In particular, it is important to include schedule delay cost as part of the benefit assessment of RPG services. in addition to the common measure of <b>travel</b> time <b>cost.</b> Copyright © Taylor and Francis Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
30|$|Zhu [5] {{used the}} method of {{successive}} averages to solve the stochastic user-equilibrium problem. He/she described the impact of congestion on passengers’ route choices. A generalized cost function with in-vehicle congestion and an amplification factor for transfer time was set up. With the K-th shortest path algorithm to generate the choice set, a route choice model was introduced to perform the stochastic network. Comparing with those practical methods used in China, this model computed more precisely. However, the passenger behavior was not considered. In addition, the effective paths were restricted by a constant or a parameter relating to the shortest path. As different OD pairs have their own transfer times and mileage, {{it is difficult to}} practically analyze the effective paths using this criterion. This model was inspired by the flow assignment theory for road traffic, but several features needed to be noticed when this model was applied into URT network: (<b>i)</b> The generalized <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> is affected considerably by in-vehicle congestion rather than vehicle-to-vehicle congestion; (ii) The transfer time at the transfer station influences the route choices of rail passengers considerably.|$|R

The model explicitly links historical oyster bottom conditions to recreational fishing catch to capture ecosystem and habitat benefits.

This relationship enables the estimation of recreational fishing values for improved Bay habitat since fishermen value higher catches and restoration of oyster bottom will lead to higher quality reef areas hence higher catch. It {{should be noted that}} our model provides a reduced form relationship between catch, the underlying fish population, and habitat quality; however, recent work show that oyster bottom provide good foraging habitat for a number of species and may therefore act as attractors and perhaps may lead to larger numbers of striped bass in the future.

In particular, we address two fundamental aspects of this problem. First, {{we focus on the}} optimisation problem of forming the travellers' coalitions that minimise the <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> of the overall system. To this end, we model the formation problem as a Graph-Constrained Coalition Formation (GCCF) one, where the set of feasible coalitions is restricted by a graph (i. e., the social network). Our approach allows users to specify both spatial and temporal preferences for the trips. Second, we tackle the payment allocation aspect of SR, by proposing the first approach that computes kernel-stable payments for systems with thousands of agents. We conduct a systematic empirical evaluation that uses real-world datasets (i. e., GeoLife and Twitter). We are able to compute optimal solutions for medium-sized systems (i. e., with 100 agents), and high quality solutions for very large systems (i. e., up to 2000 agents). Our results show that our approach improves the social welfare (<b>i.</b> e., reduces <b>travel</b> <b>costs)</b> by up to 36. 22 % with respect to the scenario with no ridesharing. Finally, our payment allocation method computes kernel-stable payments for 2000 agents in less than an hour—while {{the state of the art}} is able to compute payments only for up to 100 agents, and does so 84 times slower than our approach...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the demand for and net economic benefits from Oregon salmon sport fishing. The <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> method was used as the primary technique for demand analysis. Several empirical estimates of consumer surplus per trip and per fish were obtained from different estimation methods. The differences in net economic benefits among different versions of the <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> method were assessed. Empirical results indicated that the individual observation approaches produced higher consumer surplus estimates than the zone average approach when reported <b>travel</b> <b>costs</b> were used. These higher estimates of net economic benefits are believed to be due in part to the bias caused by <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> measurement error. However, this problem of bias was dealt with by using the instrumental variable approach. Higher estimates of net economic benefits also resulted from the use of unadjusted individual observations (UIO) for fitting the recreational demand function because this approach does not account for the declining participation rates for the more distant zones. Therefore, it is recommended that the individual observations be adjusted to a per capita basis, or that the probability of participation be linked to the UIO estimates of demand in order to compute valid estimates of net economic benefits. A quality variable was incorporated into regional and hedonic <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> models. Average and marginal values of the primary site and substitutes sites thus were directly derived from the demand equations. Estimates of total and average consumer surpluses computed from the traditional <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> model were changed very little with the addition of the substitute and quality variables in the more completely specified regional <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> models. This finding indicates that the traditional <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> model may be basically robust for estimating total and average consumer surplus. However, additional research on other recreational activities is needed to see if estimates of total consumer surplus from the traditional <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> model always remain relatively stable when quality and substitute variables are included in a regional <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> type of specification. Unfortunately, the numerical estimates of value per trip and per fish from the hedonic <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> model were rather unstable and should be considered somewhat questionable for this study. Similarly, the estimates of marginal values per fish from the regional <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> model did not seem very reasonable, being only about one-fourth of the average value per fish. Therefore, it appears that the more complex regional and hedonic <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> models require more and better quality data to yield more accurate estimates of marginal values per fish...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{dynamics}} of the traveler's day-to-day route adjustment process in the general transportation network with fixed or elastic demand and homogeneous or heterogeneous users. Each traveler is assumed to adjust his/her route choice according to the excess <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> between the instantaneous experienced <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> and a certain referred level, which induces an aggregate path flow dynamics. We call the path flow dynamics the excess <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> dynamics, which corresponds to the excess payoff dynamics in evolutionary games and serves a general framework of modeling the homogeneous or heterogeneous route choice behavior of travelers...|$|R
40|$|<b>Travel</b> <b>cost</b> {{analysis}} for Australian tourists to the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area was undertaken {{in order to}} derive a consumer surplus value for use in examining benefits of sustainable tourism to the area. Randall 2 ̆ 7 s contention that <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> analysis produces relative rather than absolute values of welfare was tested by using several different versions of <b>travel</b> <b>cost</b> specification, and found to be supported. Nevertheless, the analysis produced values of a magnitude that indicate high positive benefits from visitor use to the World Heritage Area, provided the area is managed to be ecologically sustainable...|$|R
