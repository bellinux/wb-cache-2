In addition, a systematized observation of signs is proposed to evaluate adult zebrafish welfare to reduce pain and distress.

New financing instruments and attracting private investors to technology transfer (TT) are necessary but difficult as the pattern of risk and information in this 'in-between area' is complex: Technology is not basic anymore and it requires large amounts of capital to be scaled up - with uncertain market prospects.

The article concludes with a discussion of the problems that need to be resolved to reap the full benefits of a smart specialisation approach and discusses some of its limitations...|$|R

40|$|Among {{financial}} investors, <b>investment</b> <b>funds</b> are {{the ones}} that mostly have increased their importance in capital markets where the regulation on <b>investment</b> <b>funds</b> is still incipient. By using <b>investment</b> <b>funds,</b> individual investors can have the possibility to participate in various companies as well as in market places worldwide without the need of specific and elaborated knowledge of the same companies and markets. After an introductory chapter I start analyzing the definition and activity of an <b>investment</b> <b>fund,</b> attention is also paid to the UCITS regulation for <b>European</b> <b>investment</b> <b>funds.</b> In the next chapter I analyze how <b>investment</b> <b>funds</b> are taxed in specific EU Member Countries (i. e. Italy and Luxembourg), in the United States and also how <b>investment</b> <b>funds</b> are treated in off-shore jurisdictions. The core chapter of the paper discusses the possible application of tax treaties to <b>investment</b> <b>funds,</b> in particular {{from the perspective of the}} state of source. The definition of beneficial owner and the treatment of income distributed from an <b>investment</b> <b>fund</b> are also analyzed in depth. The same chapter also focuses on the possible application of the OECD Partnership Report to <b>investment</b> <b>funds.</b> Based on my findings the last chapter is dedicated to some final considerations about the application of tax treaties to <b>investment</b> <b>funds.</b> I have always been fascinated by capital markets, their techniques and the tax treatment of income arising from investments in capital markets. I think that this paper represents a great possibility of acquiring special knowledge in a topic that I always liked. Moreover, another reason that encouraged me to choose this topic is the fact that still not many scholars have written about such a hot topic, convincing me to contribute to the discussion thereof. My objective is to analyze the possible application of tax treaties to <b>investment</b> <b>funds</b> in order to provide some suggestions as a valid starting point for a future deeper analysis...|$|R
