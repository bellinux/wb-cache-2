It did not sell well and resulted in a financial loss for its author. The public's taste for literature <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> the prelude to the Revolution, and Saint-Just's taste changed with it: aside from a few pages of an unfinished novel found amidst his papers {{at the end of his}} life, Saint-Just devoted his future writing entirely to undecorated essays of social and political theory. With his previous ambitions of literary and lawyerly fame unfulfilled, Saint-Just directed his focus on the single goal of revolutionary command.|$|E
5|$|Nine years earlier, Tchaikovsky had penned a {{ruthless}} dissection of The Five for Nadezhda von Meck. At that time, his feelings of personal isolation and professional insecurity {{had been at}} their strongest. In the nine intervening years, Mussorgsky and Borodin had both died, Balakirev had banished himself to the musical sidelines, and Cui's critical missives had lost much of their sting for Tchaikovsky. Rimsky-Korsakov {{was the only one}} left who was fully active as a composer, and much <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> the intervening years between him and Tchaikovsky as a result of Rimsky-Korsakov's change in musical values. Tchaikovsky had also changed. More secure as a composer and less isolated personally than {{he had been in the}} past, Tchaikovsky enjoyed the company he now kept with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov, and found much to enjoy in their music.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} decorations {{and the new}} westwork {{were considered}} a major feat in the 19th century.

25|$|From 1789 {{until the}} 1930s, Congress convened in December, stayed in session {{for five or}} six months, and then adjourned sine die. Occasionally, the demands of war kept Congress in session longer, but {{generally}} senators agreed with Vice President John Nance Garner who famously proclaimed, “No good legislation ever comes out of Washington after June.” By the 1950s, however, the schedule <b>had</b> <b>changed.</b> <b>In</b> 1956 Congress adjourned on July 27—marking the last time the Senate adjourned before the first of August.|$|E
25|$|Throughout much of Twitty's {{country music}} career his {{recording}} home was Decca Records, later renamed MCA.

He joined Elektra/Asylum in 1982. That label merged with its parent company, Warner Bros. Records in 1983. He stayed with Warner Bros. through early 1987 but {{then went back to}} MCA to finish his career. In 1993, shortly before he died, he recorded a new album, Final Touches.|$|E
25|$|Built between 1929 and 1951, {{the highway}} had narrow confines—which could not {{accommodate}} trucks—and sharp S exit ramps {{that made it}} obsolete almost immediately. Maintenance was minimal, {{and the use of}} corrosive salts to de-ice the highway in winter accelerated its decay. When chunks of its facade began to fall off due to lack of maintenance, and a truck and car fell through it at 14th Street in 1973, the highway was shut down, and a debate began whether to renovate it or dismantle it. Attitudes to urban planning <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> the intervening decades, and the decision was made not to repair the decaying structure.|$|E

25|$|The British {{had first}} {{acknowledged}} Tengku Abdul Rahman {{at the time}} of their first presence in Malacca. The situation however <b>had</b> <b>changed.</b> <b>In</b> 1818, Farquhar visited Tengku Hussein in the little island of Penyengat, off the coast of Bintan, the capital of the Riau Archipelago. There, new plans were drawn and in 1819, Raffles made a deal with Tengku Hussein. The agreement stated that the British would acknowledge Tengku Hussein as the legitimate ruler of Singapore if he allowed them to establish a trading post there. Furthermore, Tengku Hussein and the temenggung would receive a yearly stipend from the British. The treaty was ratified on 6 February 1819. With the Temenggung's help, Hussein left Penyengat, pretending that he was 'going fishing', and reached Singapore, where he was quickly installed as Sultan.|$|E
25|$|Moderator Tom Brokaw of NBC News {{opened the}} debate {{by stating that}} since the first debate, a lot <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> the world and for the worse.

When the candidates were asked who they would consider as the next Secretary of the Treasury, John McCain said that he might concur with Obama's suggestion of Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett {{and then went on}} also to suggest former eBay president Meg Whitman. Barack Obama reiterated the mention of Buffett and said there are also many other qualified Americans. Both candidates said {{that it is important to}} choose as Treasury Secretary someone who earns the trust of the American people. The first 5 questions all were related to the economy.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s, {{historians and}} public bodies {{had begun to}} realise the loss to the nation of this destruction. However, {{the process of change}} was long, and it was not until 1984 with the {{preservation}} of Calke Abbey that it became obvious that opinion <b>had</b> <b>changed.</b> <b>In</b> the 21st century, the period of change seems cemented. A large public appeal has assured the preservation of Tyntesfield in 2002, and in 2007, Dumfries House and its collection were saved, after protracted appeals and debates. Today, demolition has ceased to be a realistic, or legal, option for listed buildings, and an historic house (particularly one with its contents intact) has become recognized as worthy of retention and preservation. However, many country houses are still at risk and their security, even as an entirety with their contents, is not guaranteed by any legislation.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, European air forces began to {{consider}} their requirements for the coming decades. One such area of consideration was the requirement {{for a new generation}} of jet-powered trainer aircraft to replace such aircraft as the US-built Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star and French-built Fouga Magister. Britain and France established a collaborative program to pursue development of what was initially intended to become a supersonic jet aircraft. This aircraft was to be produced in two distinct variants for different roles: trainer and light attack aircraft. The result of this collaboration, the SEPECAT Jaguar, proved to be an excellent aircraft, but its definition <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> the interim, and the type emerged as a full-sized, nuclear-capable strike fighter, whose two-seat variants were used for operational conversion to the type. As such, the Jaguar was not well suited for the general training mission.|$|E
25|$|The NDP's {{strategy}} <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> {{that they}} were focusing their attacks on the Liberals rather than in 2004, where they criticized both the Liberals and Conservatives in equal measure, prompting some criticism from Paul Martin. Andrew Coyne suggested that the NDP not only wanted to disassociate themselves from the scandal-ridden Liberals, {{but also because the}} Liberals were likely to receive credit for legislation achieved under the Liberal-NDP partnership. The NDP had also lost close races in the 2004 election due to the Liberals' strategic voting. Early in the campaign, NDP MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis had asked the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to launch a criminal investigation into the leaking of the income trust announcement. The criminal probe seriously damaged the Liberal campaign and preventing them from making their key policy announcements, as well as bringing alleged Liberal corruption back into the spotlight.|$|E
25|$|Finally, on 18 February 1529, Charles V, deeply {{alarmed by}} the Ottoman {{progression}} towards Vienna, again sent a letter from Toledo to Shah Ismail, {{who had died in}} 1524 and had been replaced by Shah Tahmasp, pleading for a military diversion. His ambassador to the Shah was the knight of Saint John de Balbi, and an alliance was made with the objective of making an attack on the Ottoman Empire in the west and the east within the following year. Tahmasp also responded by expressing his friendship to the Emperor. A decision was thus taken to attack the Ottoman Empire on both fronts, but Balbi took more than one year to return to the Persian Empire, and by that time the situation <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> Persia, as Persia was forced to make peace with the Ottoman Empire because of an insurrection of the Shaybanid Uzbeks.|$|E
