5|$|After {{the end of}} the First English Civil War Rupert was {{employed}} by the young King Louis XIV of France to fight the Spanish during the final years of the Thirty Years' War. Rupert's military employment was complicated by <b>his</b> <b>promises</b> to the Holy Roman Emperor that had led to his release from captivity in 1642, and his ongoing commitment to the English Royalist faction in exile. He also became a Knight of the Garter in 1642. Throughout the period Rupert was inconvenienced by his lack of secure income, and his ongoing feuds with other leading members of the Royalist circle.|$|E

5|$|Despite having aided Togashi Masachika in {{his return}} to power, within a year the Ikkō-ikki of Kaga fell into {{conflict}} with him. Claiming that he failed to adequately deliver on <b>his</b> <b>promises</b> of economic reward, the Ikkō-ikki of Kaga revolted in 1474. Rennyo refused to support these rebellions, and the Ikkō-ikki were quickly defeated and forced to take refuge in neighboring Etchū. Shimotsuma Rensu, a ji-samurai from Echizen and an advisor to Rennyo, led another revolt, falsely claiming that Rennyo authorized his actions. This revolt also failed, and Rennyo excommunicated Rensu.|$|E
5|$|By 1801, {{the troops}} in Egypt were in an {{increasingly}} desperate situation: supplies were low, reinforcement from France almost non-existent and disease was rife. In addition they were subject to constant attack by Ottoman and irregular Egyptian forces, culminating in the assassination of General Jean Baptiste Kléber. Bonaparte, conscious of <b>his</b> <b>promises</b> to send reinforcements to the beleaguered army in Egypt, planned a series of expeditions to the region to restore morale and numbers to the expeditionary force, drawn from troops and naval units available on the French Atlantic coast. The largest force consisted of 5,000 soldiers and nine ships under Rear-Admiral Honoré Ganteaume and sailed from Brest in January 1801, but this squadron had been preceded by two frigates from Rochefort, Africaine and Régénérée.|$|E

Nonetheless, Richard Prater was forbidden to return to the castle, despite <b>his</b> <b>promises</b> to support Parliament, and his son, George Prater, only recovered Nunney from its interim owners after Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660. The castle declined and was sold by the Praters to William Whitchurch around 1700. During the 18th century the building was still in a reasonable condition and in 1789 an order was received make it ready to receive French prisoners, although it is unlikely they ever arrived.|$|E

5|$|Casimir III of Poland urged Louis to {{intervene}} in his war with the Lithuanians who had occupied Brest, Volodymyr-Volynskyi, and other important towns in Halych and Lodomeria in the previous years. The two monarchs agreed that Halych and Lodomeria would {{be integrated into the}} Kingdom of Hungary after Casimir's death. Casimir also authorized Louis to redeem the two realms for 100,000 florins if Casimir fathered a son. Louis led his army to Cracow in June 1351. Because Casimir fell ill, Louis became the sole commander of the united Polish and Hungarian army. He invaded the lands of the Lithuanian prince, Kęstutis, in July. Kęstutis seemingly accepted Louis's suzerainty on 15 August and agreed to be baptised, along with his brothers, in Buda. However, Kęstutis did nothing to fulfill <b>his</b> <b>promises</b> after Polish and Hungarian troops were withdrawn. In an attempt to capture Kęstutis, Louis returned, but he could not defeat the Lithuanians, who even killed one of his allies, Boleslaus III of Płock, in battle. Louis returned to Buda before 13 September. A papal legate visited Louis to persuade him to wage war against Stefan Dušan, Emperor of the Serbs, who had forced his Roman Catholic subjects to be re-baptised and join the Serbian Orthodox Church.|$|E
5|$|Gierek, like Gomułka in 1956, came {{to power}} on a raft of {{promises}} that everything would be different from now on: wages would rise, prices would remain stable, there would be freedom of speech, and {{those responsible for the}} violence at Gdynia and elsewhere would be punished. Although Poles were much more skeptical than they had been in 1956, Gierek was believed to be an honest and well-intentioned man, and <b>his</b> <b>promises</b> bought him some time. He used this time to create a new economic program, one based on large-scale borrowing from banks in the West — mainly from the United States and West Germany — to buy technology that would upgrade Poland's production of export goods. This massive borrowing, estimated to have totaled over 24 billion US (1970s) dollars during Gierek's years, was used to re-equip and modernize Polish industry, and to import consumer goods to give the workers more incentive to work.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{continued}} to publicly support the Provisions of Oxford, but he secretly opened discussions with Pope Urban IV, {{hoping to be}} absolved from the oath he had made at Oxford. In June 1261, the King announced that Rome had released him from <b>his</b> <b>promises</b> and he promptly held a counter-coup {{with the support of}} Edward. He purged the ranks of the sheriffs of his enemies and seized back control of many of the royal castles. The baronial opposition, led by de Montfort and de Clare, were temporarily reunited in their opposition to Henry's actions, convening their own parliament, independent of the King, and establishing a rival system of local government across England. Henry and Eleanor mobilised their own supporters and raised a foreign mercenary army. Facing the threat of open civil war, the barons backed down: de Clare switched sides once again, de Montfort left for exile in France and the baronial resistance collapsed.|$|E

5|$|In September 1949, Mirta {{gave birth}} to a son, Fidelito, so the couple moved to a larger Havana flat. Castro {{continued}} to put himself at risk, staying active in the city's politics and joining the September 30 Movement, which contained within it both communists and members of the Partido Ortodoxo. The group's purpose was to oppose the influence of the violent gangs within the university; despite <b>his</b> <b>promises,</b> Prío had failed to control the situation, instead offering many of their senior members jobs in government ministries. Castro volunteered to deliver a speech for the Movement on November 13, exposing the government's secret deals with the gangs and identifying key members. Attracting the attention of the national press, the speech angered the gangs, and Castro fled into hiding, first in the countryside and then in the U.S. Returning to Havana several weeks later, Castro lay low and focused on his university studies, graduating as a Doctor of Law in September 1950.|$|E
5|$|John succeeded Richard as king in 1199, but {{his rule}} proved unpopular {{with many of}} his barons, who in {{response}} moved against him. In 1214, while the king was at Windsor Castle, Robert Fitzwalter led an army into London and laid siege to the Tower. Although under-garrisoned, the Tower resisted and the siege was lifted once John signed the Magna Carta. The king reneged on <b>his</b> <b>promises</b> of reform, leading to {{the outbreak of the}} First Barons' War. Even after the Magna Carta was signed, Fitzwalter maintained his control of London. During the war, the Tower's garrison joined forces with the barons. John was deposed in 1216 and the barons offered the English throne to Prince Louis, the eldest son of the French king. However, after John's death in October 1216, many began to support the claim of his eldest son, Prince Henry. War continued between the factions supporting Louis and Henry, with Fitzwalter supporting Louis. Fitzwalter was still in control of London and the Tower, both of which held out until it was clear that Henry's supporters would prevail.|$|E
5|$|Matthias {{was staying}} in Moravia {{when he was}} {{informed}} {{that a group of}} Hungarian prelates and barons had offered the throne to Casimir, a younger son of King Casimir IV of Poland. The conspiracy was initiated by Archbishop John Vitéz and his nephew Janus Pannonius, Bishop of Pécs, who opposed war against the Catholic Vladislaus Jagiellon. Initially, their plan was supported by the majority of the Estates, but nobody dared to rebel against Matthias, enabling him to return to Hungary without resistance. Matthias held a Diet and promised to refrain from levying taxes without the consent of the Estates and to convoke the Diet in each year. <b>His</b> <b>promises</b> remedied most of the Estates' grievances and almost 50 barons and prelates confirmed their loyalty to him on 21 September. Casimir Jagiellon invaded on 2 October 1471. With Bishop Janus Pannonius's support, he seized Nyitra (now Nitra in Slovakia), but only two barons, John Rozgonyi and Nicholas Perényi, joined him. Within five months Prince Casimir withdrew from Hungary, Bishop Janus Pannonius died while fleeing, and Archbishop John Vitéz was forbidden to leave his see. Matthias appointed the Silesian Johann Beckensloer to administer the Archdiocese of Esztergom. Vitéz died and Beckensloer succeeded him in a year.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the {{agreement}} between Salih and Mansur fell through {{as the latter}} abandoned most of <b>his</b> <b>promises</b> to Salih, including giving his daughter's hand in marriage and according the Kilab their share of Aleppo's revenues. Salih retaliated by besieging Aleppo, while the Kilab and their Bedouin allies plundered the countryside. Mansur appealed for Byzantine intervention and warned Emperor Basil II that if left unchecked, the Bedouin uprising could spread to his territory. Basil dispatched 1,000 Armenian relief troops in response, but withdrew them after Salih informed him of Mansur's treachery and pledged his goodwill to the Byzantines. Basil may have also acquiesced to Salih to avoid provoking Bedouin raids against his territory as the emirates of both the Kilab and their Numayri kinsmen bordered the Byzantines. The withdrawal of Byzantine troops weakened Mansur's position further and strengthened Salih, who dispatched {{one of his sons}} to Constantinople to pay allegiance to Basil.|$|E
5|$|These suppressions, {{as well as}} the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act of 1536, in turn {{contributed to}} more general {{resistance}} to Henry's reforms, most notably in the Pilgrimage of Grace, a large uprising in northern England in October 1536. Some 20,000 to 40,000 rebels were led by Robert Aske, together with parts of the northern nobility. Henry VIII promised the rebels he would pardon them and thanked them for raising the issues. Aske told the rebels they had been successful and they could disperse and go home. Henry saw the rebels as traitors and did not feel obliged to keep <b>his</b> <b>promises</b> with them, so when further violence occurred after Henry's offer of a pardon he was quick to break his promise of clemency. The leaders, including Aske, were arrested and executed for treason. In total, about 200 rebels were executed, and the disturbances ended.|$|E
5|$|When the loyalist {{reinforcements}} {{rolled into}} the capital aboard tanks and armored vehicles and began to wrest the initiative, the rebels began to break. After a brief, violent battle that killed around 400 people, the coup attempt was crushed. The casualties included {{a large number of}} anti-Diệm civilians; Thi exhorted them to bring down the Ngô family by charging the palace; 13 were gunned down by the loyalist soldiers as they invaded the grounds. After the failed coup, Đông, Thi and other prominent officers fled to Tan Son Nhut and climbed aboard a C-47. They fled to Cambodia, where they were given asylum by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, a long-time Diệm opponent. Diệm promptly reneged on <b>his</b> <b>promises,</b> and intensified his authoritarian rule and crackdowns on dissidents. Almost three years after the incident, Diệm opened the trial for those involved in the coup on 8 July 1963. Thi and his fellow exiled officers were found guilty and sentenced to death in absentia. In the meantime, Thi lived self-sufficiently in Cambodia for three years.|$|E

5|$|During the mid-15th century, a {{civil war}} broke out among the Togashi clan over the {{position}} of shugo. Togashi Masachika had been driven out of Kaga by his younger brother, Kochiyo. When the Ōnin War broke out in 1467, Masachika sided with Hosokawa and Kochiyo with Yamana. In 1473, Masachika requested aid from Asakura Toshikaga, the lord of Echizen and ally of Hosokawa, {{as well as from}} the priests of Yoshizaki, who were associated with Rennyo. Masachika promised the ikki that if restored to power, he would lift his supporters out of their poverty. Further motivating the ikki to support Masachika were the religious policies of Kochiyo: Kochiyo patronized the Takada school of Jōdo Shinshū, a fierce rival to the Hongan-ji for control of the Shinshū sect, and persecuted followers of the Hongan-ji. Toshikaga pledged his support, as did the Yoshizaki priests, the latter prior to any approval from Rennyo. Rennyo eventually granted his approval to the actions of the Yoshizaki priests, and with Toshikaga providing military aid and the Ikkō-ikki rioting throughout Kaga, Masachika quickly overthrew his brother. But Ikkō-ikki support of Masachika was short-lived. By 1474, the Ikkō-ikki were in dispute with Masachika as they claimed that he did not fulfill <b>his</b> <b>promises</b> of economic reward, and they attempted a rebellion. Rennyo refused to support their actions and the rebels were quickly defeated and forced to take refuge in Etchū Province. In 1475, Shimotsuma Rensu, a disciple of Rennyo, falsely claimed that Rennyo supported a renewed uprising in Kaga. The revolt failed, and Rennyo excommunicated Rensu.|$|E
5|$|In late 1933-early 1934, a major strain {{was placed}} on German-Japanese {{relations}} when the German ambassador to Japan, when Ambassador Herbert von Dirksen appointed Ferdinand Heye, a Nazi Party member and a disreputable German businessman convicted by a Chinese court of opium smuggling in 1927 the Special German Trade Commissioner for Manchukuo. The Japanese attached much importance {{to the question of}} recognizing Manchukuo, which was seen as a litmus test for whatever one was a true friend of Japan or of China. Heye attempted with the support of Dirksen to have the Japanese give him a monopoly of exporting soybeans from Manchukuo, in exchange for which he promised to have Germany recognize Manchukuo. The ambitious Heye, having won the friendship of the Kwantung Army by promising that he would have the Reich recognize Manchukuo, then attempted to use his position as German Trade Commissioner to Manchukuo to secure a monopoly on all German investments in Manchukuo. The attempts of Heye and Dirksen to have Germany recognize Manchukuo involved them in a dispute with Neurath who preferred to keep Germany's special relationship it had established with the Kuomintang regime in China going, and who knew well that the Chinese would be extremely offended if Germany recognized Manchukuo. The Heye affair caused much bad feelings on both sides, and was ended in February 1935 with the victory of Neurath when Hitler disallowed Heye and <b>his</b> <b>promises</b> he made.|$|E
5|$|The council never materialized, since Pope Hormisdas and Anastasius {{continued}} to be at loggerheads over the Acacian Schism. Neither were the deposed bishops returned to their sees. Seeing Anastasius failing to honour <b>his</b> <b>promises,</b> in late 515 Vitalian mobilized his army and marched again towards Constantinople. Vitalian's army captured the suburb of Sycae (modern Galata) across the Golden Horn {{from the city and}} encamped there. The two magistri militum praesentalis, Patricius and John, were unwilling to engage their old friend Vitalian, thus Anastasius gave command of his forces to the former praetorian prefect of the East, Marinus, a trusted and influential aide. Despite his lack of military experience, Marinus defeated the rebel fleet in a battle at the entrance of the Golden Horn; according to the report of John Malalas, this was achieved {{through the use of a}} sulphur-based chemical substance invented by the philosopher Proclus of Athens, similar to the later Greek fire. Marinus then landed with his men on the shore of Sycae and defeated the rebels he found there. Disheartened by the losses suffered, Vitalian and his army fled north under cover of night. As a sign of his victory, Anastasius led a procession to the village of Sosthenion, where Vitalian had established his headquarters, and attended a service of thanks at the famed local church dedicated to the Archangel Michael.|$|E
