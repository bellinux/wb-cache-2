TCRs, like antibodies, constitute an important antigen recognition system within the immune system; but, whereas antibodies are restricted to targeting cell surface or secreted proteins TCRs can recognise peptides derived from intracellular targets presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA). Naturally occurring TCRs are low affinity (0.18-387 micromolar range) 2-chain membrane receptors expressed {{on the surface of}} T cells. To produce stable, soluble, high affinity TCRs capable of being used as diagnostics and therapeutics the two TCR protein chains are stabilised through the introduction of a novel <b>disulphide</b> <b>bond</b> between the 2 constant domains and the affinity increased 1-5 million fold to low picomolar values through phage display affinity maturation. To provide the soluble, affinity enhanced TCR with a biological effector function the beta chain of the TCR is fused to an scFv antibody fragment specific for the CD3 T cell co-receptor, creating an ImmTAC.

Redundant genetic coding for spermadhesins have been observed in chimpanzees, dogs, and humans. The region correlating to spermadhesin genes in rat and mice DNA is void of any spermadhesin code. These variations in expression and genetic coding of spermadhesins are seen to result from evolutionary adjustments in genes as a consequence of mutations and deletions in genetic material.|$|E

Deleting either dsbA or dsbB or both reduces <b>disulphide</b> <b>bond</b> formation but does not entirely eliminate it. Whether such background <b>disulphide</b> <b>bond</b> forming activity is enzyme-catalysed is not known. To identify possible cellular factors that might contribute to the background activity, we studied the effects of overexpressing endogenous proteins on <b>disulphide</b> <b>bond</b> formation in the periplasm.

We show that overexpressed PspE is oxidized to the sulphenic acid form and reacts with substrate proteins to form mixed disulphide adducts. DsbC either prevents the formation of these mixed disulphides or resolves these adducts subsequently. In the process, DsbC itself gets oxidized and proceeds to catalyse <b>disulphide</b> <b>bond</b> formation.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the fusion activation in Murine leukaemia virus (MLV). During entry of retroviruses into uninfected cells, the viral and cellular membranes fuse. The fusion process is {{mediated by the}} viral envelope protein composed of three SU and TM heterodimers. The peripheral SU subunit mediates receptor binding and the transmembrane TM subunit the essential fusion function. SU is believed to trap the TM in an inactive folding intermediate, which will be activated by SU dissociation. According to one model receptor binding triggers conformational changes in SU which loosen the SU and TM interaction. Thus subunit dissociation would {{be the key to}} control fusion activation. This has been presented as a model for HIV, as well as for MLV retroviruses but not yet proven. Here 1 present results that support the above model and further suggest a novel activation mechanism for the fusion function in MLV Env. I found that the SU and TM subunits of MLV Env were linked by a <b>disulphide</b> <b>bond.</b> The <b>disulphide</b> <b>bond</b> has previously been found to be associated with a conserved CWLC peptide sequence in SU. This sequnce resembles an isomerization, motif found in the active site in redox enzymes involved in rearrangement of disulphide bonds in the cell. 1 demonstrate that the CWLC motif was activated by receptor binding to isomerize the intersubunit <b>disulphide</b> <b>bond</b> in Env. This event controlled SU dissociation and TM activation. Specifically, 1 found that the Cys residue of the motif, which was not involved in the inter-subunit <b>disulphide</b> <b>bond,</b> constituted the isomerization-active group. This was shown by thiol mapping of Env subunits before and after SU-TM <b>disulphide</b> <b>bond</b> rearrangement. Receptor binding activated the isomerization reaction. Activation or triggering was also possible by depleting Env of Ca 2 +, suggesting that the inactive form of Env was stabilized by Ca 2 +. This in vitro triggering conditions was used to analyze the effect of isomerization on the Env structure. The analysis showed that isomerization caused SU dissociation. Both the free thiol and the intersubunit <b>disulphide</b> <b>bond</b> were shielded in the native Env structure. However Env triggering, e. g. by receptor binding, resulted in the concomittant exposure of the SU-TM <b>disulphide</b> <b>bond</b> and the CWLC thiol. This was shown by thiol alkylation and DTT reduction of the SUTM <b>disulphide</b> <b>bond.</b> The CWLC thiol alkylation blocked isomerization of the intersubunit <b>disulphide</b> <b>bond</b> and also arrested the fusion function. However DTT reduction of the SU-TM <b>disulphide</b> <b>bond</b> rescued the fusion function and the infectivity of the virus. This formally proved that isomerization, of the SU-TM <b>disulphide</b> <b>bond</b> controlled fusion. These experiments also revealed the alkylated, isomerization, blocked Env as an intermediate structure in Env activation. Furthermore, I found that the CWLC controlled isomerization reaction could be activated by protein perturbating agents like urea and heat. This indicated that destabilization of the interaction between SU and TM activates isomerization and that TM persists as a metastable protein in the native Env. Finally, biochemical and functional analyzes of the alkylated, isomerization blocked Env intermediate, suggested that MLV fusion involved fusion sites composed of several Env-receptor complexes. Altogether we present here a novel fusion activation pathway for MLV Envs. This involves an internal isomerase motif that triggers an SU-TM disulfide isomerization reaction in the MLV Env leading to fusion...|$|E

Misfolded P 23 H rod opsin and other mutations in the intradiscal domain are characterized by the formation of an incorrect <b>disulphide</b> <b>bond</b> between C 185 and C 187, as opposed to the correct and highly conserved C 110 –C 187 <b>disulphide</b> <b>bond.</b> Therefore, we tested the hypoth-esis that incorrect <b>disulphide</b> <b>bond</b> formation might be a factor that affects the biogenesis of rod opsin by study-ing wild-type (WT) or P 23 H rod opsin in combination with amino acid substitutions that prevent the formation of incorrect disulphide bonds involving C 185. These mutants had altered traffic dynamics, suggesting a require-ment for regulation of <b>disulphide</b> <b>bond</b> formation/reduction during rod opsin biogenesis. Here, we show that the BiP co-chaperone and reductase protein ERdj 5 (DNAJC 10) regulates this process.

When being heated, milk proteins interact via two main types of bonding: <b>disulphide</b> <b>bonds</b> and non-covalent interactions.

This research aimed to investigate the relative importance of each interaction type on the heat-induced aggregation between the proteins in milk and the functional properties of a milk product in a model food system. Experiments involved adding low concentrations of a disulphide-bond reducing agent or a thiol blocking reagent to milk systems to either enhance or inhibit the thiol-disulphide exchange reactions between the proteins. The reagent was added to unheated milks, heated milks and unheated milks followed by heating. The effect of modifying the extent of thiol-disulphide exchange reactions between the proteins on the level of proteins participating in intermolecular <b>disulphide</b> <b>bonds,</b> on the degree of interactions between the casein micelles/casein proteins and the whey proteins were investigated. The treated milks were acidified to form acid milk gels of which the rheological properties and the microstructure were examined. Results demonstrated that the proportion of proteins participating in intermolecular <b>disulphide</b> <b>bonds</b> can be controlled by systematically modifying the thiol-disulphide exchange reactions between the milk proteins.
