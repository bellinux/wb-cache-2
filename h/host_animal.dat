5|$|Like all lifeforms, new {{strains of}} E. coli evolve through the natural {{biological}} processes of mutation, gene duplication, and horizontal gene transfer; in particular, 18% {{of the genome}} of the laboratory strain MG1655 was horizontally acquired since the divergence from Salmonella. E. coli K-12 and E. coli B strains are {{the most frequently used}} varieties for laboratory purposes. Some strains develop traits that can be harmful to a <b>host</b> <b>animal.</b> These virulent strains typically cause a bout of diarrhea that is often self-limiting in healthy adults but is frequently lethal to children in the developing world. More virulent strains, such as , cause serious illness or death in the elderly, the very young, or the immunocompromised.|$|E
5|$|Some teleosts are parasites. Remoras {{have their}} front dorsal fins {{modified}} into large suckers {{with which they}} cling onto a <b>host</b> <b>animal</b> such as a whale, sea turtle, shark or ray, but this is probably a commensal rather than parasitic arrangement because both remora and host benefit from the removal of ectoparasites and loose flakes of skin. More harmful are the catfish that enter the gill chambers of fish and feed on their blood and tissues. The snubnosed eel, though usually a scavenger, sometimes bores into the flesh of a fish, and has been found inside {{the heart of a}} shortfin mako shark.|$|E
5|$|Fleas {{arose in}} the early Cretaceous, most likely as ectoparasites of mammals, {{before moving on to}} other groups {{including}} birds. Each species of flea is more or less a specialist on its <b>host</b> <b>animal</b> species: many species never breed on any other host, though some are less selective. Some families of fleas are exclusive to a single host group: for example, the Malacopsyllidae are found only on armadillos, the Ischnopsyllidae only on bats, and the Chimaeropsyllidae only on elephant shrews. The oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, is a vector of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium which causes bubonic plague. The disease was spread by rodents such as the black rat, which were bitten by fleas that then infected humans. Major outbreaks included the Plague of Justinian and the Black Death, both of which killed a sizeable fraction of the world's population.|$|E

25|$|It is {{believed}} that papillomaviruses generally co-evolve with a particular species of <b>host</b> <b>animal</b> over many years, although there are strong evidences against the hypothesis of coevolution. In a particularly speedy example, HPV-16 has evolved slightly as human populations have expanded across the globe and now varies in different geographic regions {{in a way that}} probably reflects the history of human migration.|$|E
25|$|While plant {{viruses and}} bacteriophages {{can be grown}} {{comparatively}} easily, animal viruses normally require a living <b>host</b> <b>animal,</b> which complicates their study immensely. In 1931 it was shown that influenza virus could be grown in fertilized chicken eggs, a method that is still used today to produce vaccines. In 1937, Max Theiler managed to grow the yellow fever virus in chicken eggs and produced a vaccine from an attenuated virus strain; this vaccine saved millions of lives and is still being used today.|$|E
25|$|The primary screwworm, C. hominivorax, is a {{parasitic}} species, whose larvae are {{renowned for}} eating and infesting {{the flesh of}} living organisms, primarily warm-blooded animals such as cattle and other livestock. Their larvae cause myiasis, or an infestation of maggots, in lesions or other wounds and injuries that the <b>host</b> <b>animal</b> may have. Fly strikes may occur due to such farming processes as branding, castrating, dehorning, and tailing of the host animals. These processes, along with barbed-wire cuts and flea bites, lead to myiasis in the <b>host</b> <b>animal.</b> Navels of newborns also can be the sites of infestation. C. hominivorax tends to reproduce only on the flesh of a living host. Unlike most other maggots, these maggots attack and consume healthy living tissue along with decaying tissue (hominivorax literally translates to “man-eating”). The larvae are responsible for their common name, the screwworm, because they possess small spines on each body segment that resemble a screw’s threads. After the larvae hatch, they dive into the wound and burrow deeper, perpendicular to the skin surface, eating into live flesh, again resembling a screw being driven into an object. The larvae then continue to feed on the wound fluids and the animal’s tissue.|$|E
40|$|Thirty-six {{strains of}} {{haemorrhagic}} fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) virus were isolated from patients {{and a number}} of <b>host</b> <b>animals</b> in various areas in China. They were analysed by an immunofluorescence test (IFAT) using 10 monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) specific for the HFRS virus; antigenic differences among the strains have been demonstrated. The HFRS virus strains revealed nine different reactions with the McAbs, showing that there are at least nine different antigenic determinants including group-, type- and strain-specific. Analysis of the results shows that antigenic differences among the HFRS virus strains are mainly related to differences in the <b>host</b> <b>animals...</b>|$|R

25|$|Biotin {{deficiency}} is rare. The amounts needed are small, a {{wide range}} of foods contain biotin, and intestinal bacteria synthesize biotin, which is then absorbed by the <b>host</b> <b>animal.</b> For that reason, statutory agencies in many countries, for example the USA and Australia, have not formally established a recommended daily intake of biotin. Instead, an Adequate Intake (AI) is identified based on the theory that average intake meets needs. Future research could result in biotin AIs with EARs and RDAs (see Dietary Reference Intake section).|$|E
25|$|He is {{best known}} for {{performing}} the first successful human fetal heart and kidney transplants in immunocompromised rats. Gu was the first to discover a method of lowering the mean arterial pressure of the blood entering the transplanted fetal organ within the animal host to the appropriate physiological level seen in a fetus, thus allowing the transplants to be successful. The heart and kidneys not only survived but grew larger in size and could function to support the life of the <b>host</b> <b>animal.</b> This may have important implications for the treatment of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, bilateral renal agenesis, and other congenital diseases of the heart and kidney.|$|E
25|$|Anthrax toxin is a three-protein {{exotoxin}} secreted by virulent {{strains of}} the bacterium, Bacillus anthracis—the causative agent of anthrax. The toxin was first discovered by Harry Smith in 1954. Anthrax toxin is composed of a cell-binding protein, known as protective antigen (PA), and two enzyme components, called edema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF). These three protein components act together to impart their physiological effects. Assembled complexes containing the toxin components are endocytosed. In the endosome, the enzymatic components of the toxin translocate into the cytoplasm of a target cell. Once in the cytosol, the enzymatic components of the toxin disrupts various immune cell functions, namely cellular signaling and cell migration. The toxin may even induce cell lysis, as is observed for macrophage cells. Anthrax toxin allows the bacteria to evade the immune system, proliferate, and ultimately kill the <b>host</b> <b>animal.</b> Research on anthrax toxin also provides insight into the generation of macromolecular assemblies, and on protein translocation, pore formation, endocytosis, and other biochemical processes.|$|E

25|$|A {{preceding}} antigenic challenge can {{be identified}} in approximately two-thirds of people. Viral infections thought to induce ADEM include influenza virus, enterovirus, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella zoster, Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis A, and coxsackievirus; while the bacterial infections include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Borrelia burgdorferi, Leptospira, and beta-hemolytic Streptococci. The only vaccine proven to induce ADEM is the Semple form of the rabies vaccine, but hepatitis B, pertussis, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, pneumococcus, varicella, influenza, Japanese encephalitis, and polio vaccines have all been implicated. The majority of the studies that correlate vaccination with ADEM onset use small samples or case studies. Large scale epidemiological studies (e.g., of MMR vaccine or smallpox vaccine) do not show increased risk of ADEM following vaccination. In rare cases, ADEM seems to follow from organ transplantation. An upper bound for the risk of ADEM from measles vaccination, if it exists, can be estimated to be 10 per million, which is far lower than {{the risk of developing}} ADEM from an actual measles infection, which is about 1 per 1,000 cases. For a rubella infection, the risk is 1 per 5,000 cases. Some early vaccines, later shown to have been contaminated with <b>host</b> <b>animal</b> CNS tissue, had ADEM incident rates as high as 1 in 600.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "probiotic" [...] {{originally}} {{referred to}} microorganisms that have effects on other microorganisms. The conception of probiotics involved {{the notion that}} substances secreted by one microorganism stimulated the growth of another microorganism. The term was used again to describe tissue extracts which stimulated microbial growth. The term probiotics was taken up by Parker, who defined the concept as, [...] "organisms and substances that have a beneficial effect on the <b>host</b> <b>animal</b> by contributing to its intestinal microbial balance". Later, the definition was greatly improved by Fuller, whose explanation {{was very close to}} the definition used today. Fuller described probiotics as a [...] "live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the <b>host</b> <b>animal</b> by improving its intestinal microbial balance". He stressed two important facts of probiotics: the viable nature of probiotics and the capacity to help with intestinal balance.|$|E
2500|$|Contrasting antibiotics, probiotics {{were defined}} as microbially derived factors that stimulate the growth of other microorganisms. In 1989 Roy Fuller {{suggested}} a definition of probiotics that has been widely used: [...] "A live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the <b>host</b> <b>animal</b> by improving its intestinal microbial balance". Fuller's definition emphasizes the requirement of viability for probiotics and introduces the aspect of a beneficial effect on the host.|$|E

2500|$|Heartworms go {{throughout}} several life stages {{before they}} become adults infecting the pulmonary artery of the <b>host</b> <b>animal.</b> The worms require the mosquito as an intermediate stage to complete their lifecycles. The rate of development in the mosquito is temperature-dependent, requiring about two weeks of temperature at or above 27°C (80°F). Below a threshold temperature of 14°C (57°F), development cannot occur, and the cycle is halted. As a result, transmission is limited to warm weather, and duration of the transmission season varies geographically. [...] The period between the initial infection when the dog is bitten by a mosquito and the maturation of the worms into adults living in the heart takes six to seven months in dogs and {{is known as the}} [...] "prepatent period".|$|E
2500|$|The genome of {{pathogenic}} Leptospira {{consists of}} two chromosomes. [...] The size of the genomes of L. interrogans serovars Copenhageni and Lai is approximately 4.6 Mb. [...] However, the genome of L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo is only 3.9 Mb in size {{with a large number}} of pseudogenes, gene fragments, and insertion sequences relative to the genomes of L. interrogans. L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii share 2708 genes from which 656 are pathogenic specific genes. The guanine plus cytosine (GC) content is between 35% and 41%. L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo is usually transmitted by direct exposure to infected tissues, whereas L. interrogans is often acquired from water or soil contaminated by the urine of carrier animals harboring Leptospira in their kidneys. [...] The high number of defective genes and insertion sequences in L. borgpetersenii Hardjo together with the poor survival outside of the host and difference in transmission patterns compared to L. interrogans suggest that L. borgpetersenii is undergoing insertion-sequence mediated genomic decay, with ongoing loss of genes necessary for survival outside of the <b>host</b> <b>animal.</b>|$|E
