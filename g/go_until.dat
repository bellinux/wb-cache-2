5|$|In the subplot, Marge {{finds an}} anomalously high phone bill for calls made by Lisa to the Corey hotline — a premium rate phone service where {{television}} fans {{can listen to}} the voice of a fictional actor based on The Two Coreys. Lisa promises to stop increasing the family's phone bill, but continues to make calls to the hotline from such places as Dr. Hibbert's office and a telephone at Springfield Elementary. After Principal Skinner catches her, Marge suggests that Lisa try to <b>go</b> <b>until</b> midnight without calling the hotline; if she can do so, she will have conquered her addiction. Although tempted {{throughout the rest of the}} day, Lisa beats her addiction.|$|E
5|$|The brain {{develops}} in an intricately orchestrated sequence of stages. It changes in shape {{from a simple}} swelling {{at the front of}} the nerve cord in the earliest embryonic stages, to a complex array of areas and connections. Neurons are created in special zones that contain stem cells, and then migrate through the tissue to reach their ultimate locations. Once neurons have positioned themselves, their axons sprout and navigate through the brain, branching and extending as they <b>go,</b> <b>until</b> the tips reach their targets and form synaptic connections. In a number of parts of the nervous system, neurons and synapses are produced in excessive numbers during the early stages, and then the unneeded ones are pruned away.|$|E

25|$|The Santa Fe Trail {{crossed the}} plains just {{southwest}} of Philmont in the mid-1800s. The Tooth of Time owes {{its name to}} this trail; travelers knew that once they passed it, they had only one week to <b>go</b> <b>until</b> they reached Santa Fe, New Mexico. Philmont's strategic location along the trail spurred some interest in it. In 1841, Carlos Beaubien and Guadalupe Miranda obtained a large land grant from the Mexican government, including the present ranch. Soon the grant fell {{into the hands of}} Beaubien's son-in-law Lucien Maxwell, who {{played an important role in}} developing and settling it. Maxwell sold the ranch to the Maxwell Land Grant and Railroad Company, which gave up and handed it on to a Dutch development company, which decided to parcel it out to ranchers.|$|E
25|$|Sting {{defeated}} Flair on {{a subsequent}} Nitro with the Scorpion Deathlock, {{refusing to let}} <b>go</b> <b>until</b> Luger persuaded him to do so. Sting defeated Flair again at the World War 3 pay-per-view. Later in the night, Sting competed in the World War 3 battle royal for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, which was won by Savage. Sting's alliances with Hogan and Savage led the Horsemen to attack them as well. Sting's second U.S. title reign lasted until November 13, when he was defeated by Kensuke Sasaki in Japan. At Starrcade, Sting defeated Sasaki, representing New Japan Pro Wrestling, in a non-title match to win the World Cup of Wrestling for WCW. In the next match that night, Sting lost a Triangle match involving Flair and Luger; Flair won by countout to become number one contender for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, which Flair won from Savage in the next match.|$|E

25|$|Curtiss quickly {{recognized}} Genie's nonverbal communication abilities, recalling several nonverbal interactions Genie {{had with}} strangers during that time. By this time Genie could name {{most of the}} things around her and had an estimated vocabulary of at least a few hundred words, consisting of a few verbs and adjectives and a large number of nouns. She was also extremely eager to expand her vocabulary, frequently grabbing Curtiss' hand and pointing it towards objects for which she wanted to know the word, and if Curtiss could not figure out exactly what Genie was looking for Genie refused to let <b>go</b> <b>until</b> she learned at least one new word. Curtiss noted Genie's focus on objective properties, and especially her knowledge of color words, was very unusual because these require a level of cognitive sophistication not present in young children, suggesting she developed mental mechanisms for categorization during childhood. She had also clearly learned some basic principles of grammar, and understood more than she was producing.|$|E
25|$|That {{following}} day, 14 February 1779, Cook {{marched through}} the village to retrieve the King. Cook took the King (aliʻi nui) by his own hand and led him willingly away. One of Kalaniʻōpuʻu's favorite wives, Kanekapolei and two chiefs approached the group as they were heading to boats. They pleaded with the king not to <b>go</b> <b>until</b> he stopped and sat where he stood. An old kahuna (priest), chanting rapidly while holding out a coconut, attempted to distract Cook and his men as a large crowd began to form at the shore. The king began to understand that Cook was his enemy. As Cook turned his back to help launch the boats, he was struck on the head by the villagers and then stabbed to death as he fell on {{his face in the}} surf. He was first struck on the head with a club by a chief named Kalaimanokahoʻowaha or Kanaʻina (namesake of Charles Kana'ina) and then stabbed by one of the king's attendants, Nuaa. The Hawaiians carried his body away towards the back of the town, still visible to the ship through their spyglass. Four marines, Corporal James Thomas, Private Theophilus Hinks, Private Thomas Fatchett and Private John Allen, were also killed and two others were wounded in the confrontation.|$|E

500|$|Micelotta {{was still}} {{considered}} a promising prospect in 1956, and spent spring training {{trying to fight}} his way back on the roster. By the end of March, {{with a couple of}} weeks to <b>go</b> <b>until</b> the season began, he was noted as playing very well, and the Phillies were considering keeping him on the major league roster for the season. He ended up not making the team, and spent the season with the Miami Marlins. During his time with Miami in 1956, Micelotta was known for his defensive plays at the shortstop position, making three good ones in a 61 loss against the Havana Cubans in late May. He finished the season with a [...]236 batting average and 12 home runs in 146 games.|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by former Formula One driver Mark Webber, both Mercedes drivers expressed delight at their result. Hamilton in particular described his race as [...] "great" [...] {{and added that}} he [...] "loved {{the fact that we}} had to come through from far behind." [...] Sebastian Vettel meanwhile was satisfied with his start, but lamented the red flag situation and said that Ferrari had not expected Mercedes to opt for the harder tyre compound and <b>go</b> <b>until</b> the end of the race. He later added that he was confident that Ferrari had closed the gap to Mercedes and would be able to compete for the championship throughout the season. Nico Rosberg later revealed that the team had been close to retiring his car due to persisting brake issues caused by debris caught in the brake caliper. However, he was able to manage the brake temperatures to secure victory. Rosberg also apologised to his teammate for making contact and forcing him wide at the start.|$|E
500|$|By September1905, Northern Pacific {{had already}} {{acquired}} the property {{for the future}} terminal buildings and rail yard—a strip of land two blocks wide, from 10th to 12th avenues, and stretching north from Hoyt Street to the Willamette River. [...] Construction of the railroad itself began in early 1906. [...] The new company needed freight storage and handling facilities in Portland, and to this end it built the two [...] "freight houses" [...] at 11th Avenue and Hoyt Street, in 1908. [...] SP passenger train service was originally expected to terminate at Union Station, located about [...] to the east, but lengthy negotiations between SP and Union Station's operator, the Northern Pacific Terminal Company, eventually reached an impasse. [...] The Terminal Company was only partially owned by SP parent Northern Pacific Railway, and partially by competing railroads. [...] With {{only a few weeks}} to <b>go</b> <b>until</b> passenger service to Portland was to be started, it was reported that SP would instead equip one of its new freight houses for use as a passenger station, in place of access to Union Station, at least temporarily.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} ship the game, Bungie began paring back their ambitions for the single- and {{multiplayer}} {{parts of the}} game. Chris Butcher commented, [...] "For Halo 2 we had our sights set very high on networking. ... Going from having no Internet multiplayer to developing a completely new online model was a big challenge to tackle all at once, {{and as a result}} we had to leave a lot of things undone {{in order to meet the}} ship date commitment that we made to our fans." [...] With only a year to <b>go</b> <b>until</b> release, Bungie went into the [...] "mother of all crunches" [...] in order to finish the game; in a 2007 interview, Jamie Griesemer, one of Halos design leads, said that this lack of a [...] "polish" [...] period near the end of the development cycle was the main reason for Halo 2s shortcomings. Butcher retrospectively described Halo 2s multiplayer mode as [...] "a pale shadow of what it could and should have been if we had gotten the timing of our schedule right"; the campaign mode's abrupt cliffhanger ending also resulted from the frenzy to ship on time.|$|E
500|$|April {{travels to}} Central America {{for work and}} finds [...] Leonardo, telling him that the Turtles have drifted apart. April returns to New York City with a statue for wealthy tycoon Max Winters. Leonardo also returns, and April and Casey deliver the statue to Winters. Winters hires Karai and the Foot Clan to search {{the city for the}} 13 monsters before the portal opens again. Raphael {{encounters}} Casey, who reveals his knowledge of Raphael's double identity and joins him in hunting criminals. Winters, who is actually Yaotl and is still immortal, reanimates his stone generals. Leonardo returns to the sewer lair, meeting Splinter. Splinter forbids the Turtles from fighting until they can act as a team again. While training, the Turtles encounter one of the 13 beasts, Bigfoot, battling the Foot Clan. The Turtles engage Bigfoot, going against Leonardo and Splinter's orders. When Raphael visits Casey, they encounter Vampire Succubor, one of the monsters and witness its capture by the Foot and the Stone Generals, who spot them. Raphael is knocked unconscious. Casey takes Raphael back to the apartment while April calls the Turtles for help and reveals the identities of Yaotl and his generals. After being revived, Raphael suggests they pursue Yaotl, but Leonardo forbids him to <b>go</b> <b>until</b> Splinter gives out the order. Raphael investigates alone.|$|E
500|$|Tom {{establishes}} {{that the}} island has {{some control over}} whether characters can die, as demonstrated when Michael unsuccessfully attempts to commit suicide three times. Kitsis thought that [...] "It was interesting what [...] said to Michael … that really carries through Michael's arc." [...] Later in the season, Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) tries to shoot Michael in the head, but the gun jams and the next day, {{a manifestation of the}} island in the form of Christian Shephard (John Terry) appears before Michael. Damon Lindelof confirmed that the island's [...] "cosmic intervention of fate" [...] also played a part in the car crash that foiled Jack's suicide attempt in the third-season finale. Following the broadcast of the fourth midseason premiere, Lindelof further confirmed that this island force prevents Ben and Widmore from dying. Cuse has said that [...] "There is a raging debate on the show about what constitutes free will and what constitutes destiny and Michael's story was sort of a argument on the destiny side of that equation. He had more destiny to fulfil with that island than he anticipated and maybe the audience anticipated." [...] Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that [...] "the island doesn't let you <b>go</b> <b>until</b> it's done with you and I think that the rest of our characters are going to feel the reverberations of that, as well." ...|$|E
