5|$|In many plants, {{defensive}} or {{storage structures}} {{are made by}} modifications {{of the development of}} primary leaves, stems, and roots. Leaves are variously modified from photosynthetic structures to form the insect-trapping pitchers of pitcher plants, the insect-trapping jaws of Venus <b>flytrap,</b> and the spines of cactuses, all homologous.|$|E
5|$|Plants are not passive, but {{respond to}} {{external}} signals such as light, touch, and injury by moving or growing towards {{or away from}} the stimulus, as appropriate. Tangible evidence of touch sensitivity is the almost instantaneous collapse of leaflets of Mimosa pudica, the insect traps of Venus <b>flytrap</b> and bladderworts, and the pollinia of orchids.|$|E
5|$|It has a diploid {{chromosome}} number of 2n = 34, which is unusual for the genus Drosera {{and closer to the}} diploid {{chromosome number}} of the Venus <b>flytrap</b> (Dionaeamuscipula), another member of the Droseraceae. Variable chromosome counts for Dionaea from multiple studies include 2n = 30, 32, and 33. Of the Drosera species with known chromosome counts, most are a multiple of x = 10. Based on an extensive review of karyotype studies, the botanist Fernando Rivadavia suggested that the base chromosome number for the genus could be 2n = 20, a number that many Drosera species share including the widespread D.rotundifolia. Exceptions to this base number include the Australian, New Zealand and Southeast Asian Drosera, which have chromosome numbers ranging from 2n = 6 to 64.|$|E

5|$|Thousands {{of plant}} species are {{cultivated}} for aesthetic purposes {{as well as}} to provide shade, modify temperatures, reduce wind, abate noise, provide privacy, and prevent soil erosion. Plants are the basis of a multibillion-dollar per year tourism industry, which includes travel to historic gardens, national parks, rainforests, forests with colorful autumn leaves, and festivals such as Japan's and America's cherry blossom festivals. While some gardens are planted with food crops, many are planted for aesthetic, ornamental, or conservation purposes. Arboretums and botanical gardens are public collections of living plants. In private outdoor gardens, lawn grasses, shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous perennials and bedding plants are used. Gardeners may cultivate the plants in a naturalistic state, or may sculpture their growth, as with topiary or espalier. Gardening is the most popular leisure activity in the U.S., and working with plants or horticulture therapy is beneficial for rehabilitating people with disabilities. Plants may also be grown or kept indoors as houseplants, or in specialized buildings such as greenhouses that are designed for the care and cultivation of living plants. Venus <b>Flytrap,</b> sensitive plant and resurrection plant are examples of plants sold as novelties. There are also art forms specializing in the arrangement of cut or living plant, such as bonsai, ikebana, and the arrangement of cut or dried flowers. Ornamental plants have sometimes changed the course of history, as in tulipomania.|$|E
25|$|In a plant {{such as the}} Venus <b>Flytrap</b> {{that can}} make its own food through photosynthesis, it does not eat and digest its prey for the {{traditional}} objectives of harvesting energy and carbon, but mines prey primarily for essential nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus in particular) that {{are in short supply}} in its boggy, acidic habitat.|$|E
25|$|A {{carnivorous}} plant that catches no insects at all will rarely die, although its growth may be impaired. In general, these plants are best {{left to their}} own devices: after underwatering with tap-water, {{the most common cause of}} Venus <b>flytrap</b> death is prodding the traps to watch them close and feeding them inappropriate items.|$|E

50|$|Plants can be {{propagated}} by seed, taking {{around four}} to five years to reach maturity. More commonly, they are propagated by clonal division in spring or summer. Venus <b>flytraps</b> can also be propagated in vitro using plant tissue culture. Most Venus <b>flytraps</b> found for sale in nurseries garden centers have been produced using this method, as this is the most cost-effective way to propagate them on a large scale. Regardless of the propagation method used, the plants will live for 20 to 30 years if cultivated in the right conditions.|$|R
50|$|Pocosin wetlands, {{a type of}} wetland that {{supports}} rare carnivorous plant species, {{are found in the}} park. Carnivorous plants found at this park include Venus <b>flytraps,</b> pitcher plants, butterworts and bladderworts.|$|R
25|$|The active glue traps use rapid plant {{movements}} to trap their prey. Rapid plant movement {{can result from}} actual growth, or from rapid changes in cell turgor, which allow cells to expand or contract by quickly altering their water content. Slow-moving flypapers like Pinguicula exploit growth, while the Venus <b>flytrap</b> uses such rapid turgor changes which make glue unnecessary. The stalked glands that once made glue became teeth and trigger hairs in Drosera â€”an example of natural selection hijacking preexisting structures for new functions.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the damage}} that the burning of raw peat can cause, bogs are {{naturally}} subject to wildfires and depend on the wildfires to keep woody competition from lowering the water table and shading out many bog plants. Several families of plants including the carnivorous Sarracenia (trumpet pitcher), Dionaea (Venus <b>flytrap),</b> Utricularia (bladderworts) and non-carnivorous plants such as the sandhills lily, toothache grass and many species of orchid are now threatened {{and in some cases}} endangered from the combined forces of human drainage, negligence, and absence of fire.|$|E
25|$|The archetypal carnivore, the Venus <b>flytrap,</b> {{grows in}} soils with almost immeasurable nitrate and calcium levels. Plants need {{nitrogen}} for protein synthesis, calcium for cell wall stiffening, phosphate for nucleic acid synthesis, and iron for chlorophyll synthesis. The soil is often waterlogged, which favours {{the production of}} toxic ions such as ammonium, and its pH is an acidic 4 to 5. Ammonium {{can be used as}} a source of nitrogen by plants, but its high toxicity means that concentrations high enough to fertilise are also high enough to cause damage.|$|E

25|$|North Carolina {{consists}} of three main geographic regions: the Atlantic coastal plain, occupying the eastern portion of the state; the central Piedmont region, and the Mountain region in the west, {{which is part of}} the Appalachian Mountains. The coastal plain {{consists of}} more specifically-defined areas known as the Outer Banks, a string of sandy, narrow barrier islands separated from the mainland by sounds or inlets, including Albemarle Sound and Pamlico Sound, the tidewater region, the native home of the venus <b>flytrap,</b> and the inner coastal plain, where longleaf pine trees are native.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} other deep-sea anglerfishes, Thaumatichthys shows extreme sexual {{dimorphism}} with the females much larger and different in morphology from the males. Female Thaumatichthys {{are characterized by}} a long, broad, flattened head with enlarged premaxillaries on the upper jaw that overhang the relatively short lower jaw. The premaxillaries are hinged with the skull {{in such a way}} that they can be moved down to enclose the lower jaw in a manner similar that of a Venus <b>flytrap.</b> The outer margin of the premaxillaries bear six rows of long, conical, recurved teeth; the teeth in the lower jaw are much shorter. The number and length of the teeth increases as the fish grows.|$|E
25|$|The traps {{are very}} similar, with leaves whose {{terminal}} section {{is divided into}} two lobes, hinged along the midrib. Trigger hairs (three on each lobe in Dionaea muscipula, many more in the case of Aldrovanda) inside the trap lobes are sensitive to touch. When a trigger hair is bent, stretch-gated ion channels in the membranes of cells {{at the base of the}} trigger hair open, generating an action potential that propagates to cells in the midrib. These cells respond by pumping out ions, which may either cause water to follow by osmosis (collapsing the cells in the midrib) or cause rapid acid growth. The mechanism is still debated, but in any case, changes in the shape of cells in the midrib allow the lobes, held under tension, to snap shut, flipping rapidly from convex to concave and interring the prey. This whole process takes less than a second. In the Venus <b>flytrap,</b> closure in response to raindrops and blown-in debris is prevented by the leaves having a simple memory: for the lobes to shut, two stimuli are required, 0.5 to 30 seconds apart.|$|E
25|$|The more {{carnivorous}} a plant is, {{the less}} conventional its habitat {{is likely to}} be. Venus <b>flytraps</b> live in a very specialised habitat, whereas less carnivorous plants (Byblis, Pinguicula) are found in less unusual habitats (i.e., those typical for non-carnivores). Byblis and Drosophyllum both come from relatively arid regions and are both passive flypapers, arguably the lowest maintenance form of trap. Venus <b>flytraps</b> filter their prey using the teeth around the trap's edge, {{so as not to}} waste energy on hard-to-digest prey. In evolution, laziness pays, because energy can be used for reproduction, and short-term benefits in reproduction will outweigh long-term benefits in anything else.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, {{the state}} of North Carolina passed Senate Bill 734 which classifies the theft of {{naturally}} growing Venus <b>flytraps</b> in {{the state as a}} felony. Tougher sanctions and penalties for the theft were also enacted in December 1, 2014 in accordance with legislation.|$|R

25|$|In 1963, Wood {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} for Shotgun Wedding, an exploitation film about hillbillies marrying child brides, and Wood's transitional film, once again combining two genres, horror and grindhouse skin-flick, was 1965's Orgy of the Dead, originally titled Nudie Ghoulies. Wood handled various production details while Stephen C. Apostolof directed under the pseudonym A. C. Stephen. The film {{begins with a}} re-creation of the opening scene from the then-unreleased Night of the Ghouls. Criswell, wearing one of Lugosi's old capes, rises from his coffin to deliver an introduction taken almost word-for-word from the previous film. Set in a misty graveyard, the Lord of the Dead (Criswell) and his sexy consort, the Black Ghoul (a Vampira look-alike), preside over a series of macabre performances by topless dancers from beyond the grave (recruited by Wood from local strip clubs). The film also features a Wolf Man and a Mummy. Together, Wood and Apostolof went on to make a string of sexploitation films up to 1977. Wood co-wrote the screenplays and occasionally acted. Venus <b>Flytrap</b> (1970), a US/Japan horror film, {{was based on an}} unproduced Wood screenplay from the 1950s.|$|E

500|$|The Gravemind's {{physical}} form {{is depicted as}} composed of rotting corpses and biomatter, towering nearly eighty meters high as seen in Halo 2. Gravemind resembles a large Venus <b>Flytrap</b> with many tentacles, but is capable of movement and linguistic communication via its large mouth formed from overlapping fleshy [...] "leaves". Though an animal, the Gravemind's somewhat plantlike appearance has drawn comparisons to Audrey II from the 1986 film Little Shop of Horrors due to the tentacles about a central mouth. For Halo 2: Anniversary, the Gravemind now has three flesh-flaps that protrude and dangle towards the front of its head, each one decorated with teeth. It is also given {{a different sort of}} mouth, one that resembles a lipless mouth with fangs.|$|E
50|$|Venus <b>flytraps</b> {{are by far}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} recognized and cultivated carnivorous plant, and they are frequently sold as houseplants.

50|$|Healthy Venus <b>flytraps</b> {{will produce}} scapes of white flowers in spring; however, many growers remove the {{flowering}} stems early (2-3 inches), as flowering consumes {{some of the}} plant's energy and thereby reduces the rate of trap production.

500|$|On Los Angeles's skid row, penny-pinching Gravis Mushnick owns a florist shop {{which is}} staffed {{by him and}} his two employees, the sweet but simple Audrey Fulquard and clumsy Seymour Krelboyne. Although the rundown shop gets little business, there are some repeat customers; for instance, Mrs. Siddie Shiva shops almost daily for flower {{arrangements}} for her many relatives' funerals. Another regular customer is Burson Fouch, who eats the plants he buys for lunch. When Seymour fouls up the arrangement of Dr. Farb, a sadistic dentist, Mushnick fires him. Hoping Mushnick will change his mind, Seymour tells him about a special plant that he crossbred from a butterwort and a Venus <b>flytrap.</b> Bashfully, Seymour admits that he named the plant [...] "Audrey Jr.", a revelation that delights the real Audrey.|$|E
500|$|Drosera regia, {{commonly}} known as the king sundew, is a carnivorous plant in the sundew genus Drosera that is endemic to a single valley in South Africa. The genus name Drosera comes from the Greek word droseros, meaning [...] "dew-covered". The specific epithet regia is derived from the Latin for [...] "royal", a reference to the [...] "striking appearance" [...] of the species. Individual leaves can reach [...] in length. It has many unusual relict characteristics not found in most other Drosera species, including woody rhizomes, operculate pollen, and the lack of circinate vernation in scape growth. All of these factors, combined with molecular data from phylogenetic analysis, contribute to the evidence that D.regia possesses some of the most ancient characteristics within the genus. Some of these are shared with the related Venus <b>flytrap</b> (Dionaeamuscipula), which suggests a close evolutionary relationship.|$|E
500|$|Evidence for the {{evolution}} of [...] "snap-traps" [...] of Dionaea and Aldrovanda from a flypaper trap like D.regia has also emerged and been argued for based on molecular data. The molecular and physiological data implies that the Venus <b>flytrap</b> (Dionaea) and Aldrovanda snap-traps evolved from the flypaper traps of a common ancestor with the Drosera; the living evidence of a link between Drosera and Dionaea is D.regia and its remnant characteristics. In this evolutionary model, pre-adaptations to evolution into snap-traps were identified in several species of Drosera, such as rapid leaf and tentacle movement. The model proposes that plant carnivory by snap-trap evolved from the flypaper traps of Drosera, driven by increasing prey size. Larger prey can easily escape the sticky mucilage of flypaper traps; {{the evolution}} of snap-traps would largely prevent escape and kleptoparasitism (theft of prey captured by the plant before it can derive any benefit from it).|$|E
