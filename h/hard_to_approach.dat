Those who knew Beth De Graf best loved her dearly, but strangers found her <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> and were often repulsed by her unresponsive manner. Underneath all, the girl was a real girl, with many splendid qualities, and Uncle John relied upon Beth's stability more than on that of his other two nieces.

The mid-19th century whaling onslaught occurred before there was much scientific interest in whale behavior, and included no scientific observation.

40|$|Based on {{the theory}} of coalgebras the paper builds a bridge between CSP and automata theory. We show that the {{concepts}} of processes in [4] coincide with the concepts of states for special, namely, final partial automata. Moreover, we show how the deterministic and nondeterministic operations in [4] can be interpreted in a compatible way by constructions on the semantical level of automata. Especially, {{we are able to}} interpret each finite process expression as representing a finite partial automaton with a designated initial state. In such a way we provide a new method for solving recursive process equations which is based on the concept of final automata. That is, {{there is no need to}} impose a cpo structure on the set of processes to describe the solutions of recursive process equations. 1 Introduction For people usually working on model theory or semantics of formal specifications it becomes often very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> the area of process calculi and process algebras.

40|$|I review {{recent work}} on nonperturbative path {{integral}} quantization of two-dimensional dilaton gravity coupled to Dirac fermions, employing the ”Vienna school “ approach. Despite much progress in {{our knowledge of}} quantum gravity 1 during the last decades, a fully satisfactory quantization of the simplest nontopologicala gravity theory, namely general relativity in four dimensions, is still missing. The reasons are two-fold: On one hand, standard techniques from perturbative quantum field theory {{do not apply to}} arbitrary high energies to perturbatively nonrenormalizable general relativity. On the other hand, its highly nonlinear dynamics makes general relativity <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> with nonperturbative methods. Adding the lack of observational data for quantized gravitational effects, it is hard to compare the suitability of different approaches and methods to quantize gravity. In such a context it may be useful to consider less complicated situations, where even conservative methods like standard quantum field theory can be applied to gravity. Such a situation is given in lower dimensions. In two dimensions, however, pure Einstein-Hilbert gravity is topological, the action being proportional to the Eule...|$|E

Local tour operators confirmed that targeted species for hunting such as Baird's Beaked Whales and Dall's Porpoises are known to disappear or have become <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> in the seasons of whaling operations in the area. Recent notable declines and disappearances (or abandoning of historical habitats) of Minke and Baird's Beaked Whales in coastal waters caused by commercial and scientific whaling that have been operated in wide ranges off the eastern half of Honshu and Hokkaido especially off Abashiri, Gulf of Sendai, and along the coast of Chiba, caused dramatic decreases in sightings of both species in many areas, enough for whalers to be forced to change their operating ranges, and a watching operator in Muroran claimed that whaling affected the profits of the operator due to serious declines and low rates of successful minke sightings in the area. Hunting of Baird's Beaked Whales in Sea of Japan has ceased in recent decades, and the whales have been said to have become more friendly during this period; however, commercial whaling was resumed in Sea of Japan and caused concerns among cetacean conservationists.|$|R

The curriculum goals have stated clearly that the literature component should engage students in reading for enjoyment and self-development. However, it is actually very rare to see that these aspirations been implemented during the teaching of literature component in the real English language classroom setting. Therefore, this study aims to identify the teaching approaches that English language teachers use when teaching literature in class, the reasons behind the selection of approaches being used and also the differences between the teaching approaches used by teachers teaching in rural and urban secondary schools. The data for this study was collected via questionnaire and the respondents of this study were 149 English language teachers who have been teaching English language subject in secondary schools. In this study, it is found that teacher-centered approach is used more than student-centered approach when teaching literature component. Furthermore, teacher-centered approach is employed the most in rural secondary schools while urban secondary teachers are more prone to use student-centered approach when they teach literature to their students. The teaching approaches employed in class are greatly determined by their students’ level of proficiency in the language. The reason was mainly because the students did not have the competency in language, so it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> literature through student-centered way...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{practices}} {{are essential for}} sustaining the human population, {{but at the same}} time they can directly disrupt ecosystem functioning. Ecological risk assessment (ERA) aims to estimate possible adverse effects of human activities on ecosystems and their parts. Current ERA practices, however, incorporate very little ecology and base the risk estimates on the results of standard tests with several standard species. The main obstacles for a more ecologically relevant ERA are the lack of clear protection goals and the inherent complexity of ecosystems that is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> empirically. In this paper, we argue that the ecosystem services framework offers an opportunity to define clear and ecologically relevant protection goals. At the same time, ecological models provide the tools to address ecological complexity to the degree needed to link measurement endpoints and ecosystem services, and to quantify service provision and possible adverse effects from human activities. We focus on the ecosystem services relevant for agroecosystem functioning, including pollination, biocontrol and eutrophication effects and present modeling studies relevant for quantification of each of the services. The challenges of the ecosystem services approach are discussed as well as the limitations of ecological models in the context of ERA. A broad, multi-stakeholder dialog is necessary to aid the definition of protection goals in terms of services delivered by ecosystems and their parts. The need to capture spatio-temporal dynamics and possible interactions among service providers pose challenges for ecological models as a basis for decision making. However, we argue that both fields are advancing quickly and can prove very valuable in achieving more ecologically relevant ERA...|$|E
