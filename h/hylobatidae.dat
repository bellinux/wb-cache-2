25|$|Biologists {{classify}} humans, {{along with}} only a few other species, as great apes (species in the family Hominidae). The living Hominidae include two distinct species of chimpanzee (the bonobo, Pan paniscus, and the common chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes), two species of gorilla (the western gorilla, Gorilla gorilla, and the eastern gorilla, Gorilla graueri), and two species of orangutan (the Bornean orangutan, Pongo pygmaeus, and the Sumatran orangutan, Pongo abelii). The great apes with the family <b>Hylobatidae</b> of gibbons form the superfamily Hominoidea of apes.|$|E
25|$|The closest living {{relatives}} of humans are chimpanzees (genus Pan) and gorillas (genus Gorilla). With the sequencing {{of both the}} human and chimpanzee genome, current estimates of similarity between human and chimpanzee DNA sequences range between 95% and 99%. By using the technique called a molecular clock which estimates the time required {{for the number of}} divergent mutations to accumulate between two lineages, the approximate date for the split between lineages can be calculated. The gibbons (family <b>Hylobatidae)</b> and orangutans (genus Pongo) were the first groups to split from the line leading to the humans, then gorillas (genus Gorilla) followed by the chimpanzees (genus Pan). The splitting date between human and chimpanzee lineages is placed around 4–8 million years ago during the late Miocene epoch. During this split, chromosome 2 was formed from two other chromosomes, leaving humans with only 23 pairs of chromosomes, compared to 24 for the other apes.|$|E
25|$|Fossil {{evidence}} suggests that humans' earliest hominid ancestors may have split from other primates {{as early as the}} late Oligocene, circa 26 to 24 Ma, and that by the early Miocene, the adaptive radiation of many different hominoid forms was well underway. Evidence from the molecular dating of genetic differences indicates that the gibbon lineage (family <b>Hylobatidae)</b> diverged between 18 and 12 Ma, and the orangutan lineage (subfamily Ponginae) diverged about 12 Ma. While there is no fossil evidence thus far clearly documenting the early ancestry of gibbons, fossil proto-orangutans may be represented by Sivapithecus from India and Griphopithecus from Turkey, dated to around 10 Ma. Molecular evidence further suggests that between 8 and 4 Ma, first the gorillas, and then the chimpanzee (genus Pan) split from the line leading to the humans. We have no fossil record of this divergence, but distinctively hominid fossils have been found dating to 3.2 Ma (see Lucy) and possibly even earlier, at 6 or 7 Ma (see Toumaï). Comparisons of DNA show that 99.4 percent of the coding regions are identical in chimpanzees and humans (95–96% overall), which is taken as strong evidence of recent common ancestry. Today, only one distinct human species survives, but many earlier species have been found in the fossil record, including Homo erectus, Homo habilis, and Homo neanderthalensis.|$|E
40|$|Monitoring {{programmes}} often rely {{on changes}} in densities of single species to indicate an ecosystem's health. These densities are estimated by a range of census techniques, including line transects and fixed point counts. Using data from gibbons (Primates: <b>Hylobatida)</b> the present study demonstrates that habitat disturbance (e. g., logging, encroachment) induces changes in the behaviour of species {{in such a way}} that it affects density estimation. As a result of disturbance, gibbons alter their response to humans, change their time budgets, and use different canopy levels. Calling rates are generally lowered in response to disturbance and relatively more calls are given at later times of the day. These behavioural changes alter the detectablity of gibbons, both positively and negatively. The different factors influencing populat on estimation act in concert and may be difficult to separate to determine their effect. It is argued that in order to improve the effectiveness of monitoring and ce sussing, the link between behavioural biology and conservation biology should be strengthened...|$|R

50|$|Gibbons are apes in {{the family}} of the <b>Hylobatidae.</b> The gibbon family {{contains}} four genera. Today gibbons occur in tropical and subtropical rainforests from northeast India to Indonesia and north to southern China, but their range extended considerably north of their current habitat during the times of medieval China. Gibbons are predominantly arboreal, with a specialized ball-and-socket wrist structure. They are also known for their extensive vocalizations.|$|E

Based on their size, and some superficial similarities to modern day gibbons, Zapfe suggested that pliopithecoids were ancestral to the <b>Hylobatidae</b> lineage.|$|E
50|$|The silvery gibbon (Hylobates moloch) is a primate in the gibbon family, <b>Hylobatidae.</b> Its coat is bluish-grey in colour, {{with a dark}} grey {{or black}} cap.

5000|$|The lesser apes are the gibbon family, <b>Hylobatidae,</b> {{of sixteen}} species; all are native to Asia.

50|$|Molecular {{evidence}} indicates that the lineage of gibbons (family <b>Hylobatidae)</b> diverged from Great Apes some 18-12 million years ago, and that of orangutans (subfamily Ponginae) diverged from the other Great Apes at about 12 million years; there are no fossils that clearly document the ancestry of gibbons, which may have originated in a so-far-unknown South East Asian hominoid population, but fossil proto-orangutans may be represented by Sivapithecus from India and Griphopithecus from Turkey, dated to around 10 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|The eastern {{hoolock gibbon}} (Hoolock leuconedys) is a primate from the gibbon family, <b>Hylobatidae.</b> It {{is one of}} three species of hoolock gibbon.

50|$|As {{discussed}} above, hominoid taxonomy {{has undergone}} several changes.
