40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the properties of}} mutual <b>encompassing</b> {{and its relationship to}} the KLIC equivalence between statistical models. It is shown that models are KLIC equivalent if and only if they are mutually <b>encompassing</b> and mutually Cox <b>encompassing.</b> Further, within the exponentional familly <b>encompassing</b> implies Cox-encompassing and so mutual <b>encompassing</b> is necessary and sufficient for KLIC equivalence in this family. In addition, it is shown that mutual <b>encompassing</b> is transitive for models in the exponential family...|$|R

40|$|The <b>encompassing</b> {{principle}} {{has been}} carefully and precisely defined in various contexts, since its {{first appearance in}} the 1980 s literature in numerous papers by Hendry, Mizon and Richard. Since then, several distinct notions of <b>encompassing</b> have been proposed and still coexist in the literature. We describe, illustrate and connect these notions in this paper. We start with the intuitive properties of exact <b>encompassing</b> between estimated models and compare it with its testable counterpart, approximate <b>encompassing.</b> We examine these notions and their main properties within static and dynamic, parametric and non-parametric, classical and Bayesian models and estimators. <b>Encompassing</b> {{or the lack of}} <b>encompassing,</b> is also studied via the concepts of parsimonious and partial <b>encompassing.</b> Pseudo-true values, which are central elements in measuring and testing approximate <b>encompassing,</b> are defined in line with the concept of specificity between models. We also examine the role played by the data generating process in the different approaches in the literature.

The latter permits the State to classify persons for legitimate purposes, provided there is a reasonable basis for the same, meaning that the classification is required to be non-arbitrary, based on a method of intelligible differentiation among those sought to be classified, as well as have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the classification.|$|E

40|$|We {{obtain the}} prior and {{posterior}} {{probability of a}} nested regression model as the Hausdorff-integral of the prior and posterior on the parameters of an <b>encompassing</b> linear regression model over a lower dimensional set that represents the nested model. The invariant expression of the Hausdorff-integral results from a uniformly converging limit sequence of <b>encompassing</b> full dimensional sets. The uniform convergence avoids the Borel-Kolmogorov paradox. Basing priors and prior probabilities of nested regression models on the prior on the parameters of an <b>encompassing</b> linear regression model reduces the discrepancies between classical and Bayesian inference, like, the Jeffreys-Lindley's paradox. Depending on the parameter {{of interest in the}} <b>encompassing</b> linear regression model, the posterior odds ratio is fully robust to the Jeffreys-Lindley's paradox or only allows for a non-informative prior on the parameters of the <b>encompassing</b> model. We illustrate the analysis with examples of linear restrictions, i. e. a linear regression model, and non-linear restrictions, i. e. a cointegration and an autoregressive moving average model, on the parameters of an <b>encompassing</b> linear regression model...|$|R
