40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the critical limits for surface water acidification used in the critical loads calculation under the UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution and the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) classification in Norway. The critical limits to be compared were the ANClimit,oaa,var from the critical loads calculation and the ANC <b>good-moderate</b> boundary values from the WFD classification. They are not directly comparable, but were compared by using them to calculate critical loads. ANC <b>good-moderate</b> boundary values from the first WFD classification manual gave unrealistic results, showing that these boundary values were too high. Critical loads based on the ANClimit,oaa,var from the critical loads work and the ANC <b>good-moderate</b> boundary values from the second WFD classification manual gave fairly harmonised results. Thus, the requirements set by the two management systems are similar. However, the WFD requirements are somewhat less strict overall, and especially for regions with naturally low buffering capacity or high TOC concentration. Splitting the upper TOC category is recommended. Further harmonisation of the critical limits is possible, but the WFD concept of discrete boundary values sets limitations to complete harmonisation. Updating the ANClimit,oaa,var based on changes in TOC concentration could be considered. Det er to typer politiske reguleringer som brukes i forvaltningen knyttet til forsuring i ferskvann i Norge: UNECEs konvensjon for langtransporterte luftforurensninger (LRTAP) og EUs rammedirektiv for vann (Vannforskriften). Begge bruker grenseverdier for å definere de kjemiske forholdene som er nødvendige for å oppnå ønskelige biologiske forhold. Formålet med dette arbeidet var å sammenligne grenseverdiene brukt i LRTAP-konvensjonen og i implementeringen av vannforskriften i Norge, siden det er viktig at det settes de samme kravene på tvers av forvaltningssystemer.

30|$|Conclusions: The {{implementation}} of the new guideline has resulted in reduced mortality for patients admitted to ICU with a haematological disease. While aspects of the guideline have made no difference to outcome, our results demonstrate that early referrals by haematologists prior to developing multiorgan failure in individuals who have <b>good-moderate</b> functional capacity, {{have a positive effect}} on mortality. In our institution this was achieved with increased reliance on early warning scoring systems, critical care outreach teams and consultant to consultant referrals.|$|E
30|$|We found {{adequate}} interobserver {{agreement for}} both LUSm (weighted kappa 0.95) and TI (ICC 0.78, difference according to Bland–Altman analysis[*]±[*] 12.5 %). LUSm showed <b>good-moderate</b> discriminative power for successful weaning and extubation (area under the ROC curve (AUC) for successful weaning 0.80, and {{sensitivity and specificity}} at optimal cut-off point 0.76 and 0.73, respectively; AUC for successful extubation 0.78, and optimal sensitivity and specificity 0.76 and 0.47, respectively. TI was more sensitive but less specific for predicting successful weaning (AUC 0.71, optimal sensitivity and specificity 0.93 and 0.48) and successful extubation (AUC 0.76, optimal sensitivity and specificity 0.93 and 0.58). The area under the ROC curve for predicting weaning success was 0.83 for both ultrasound measurements together.|$|E
40|$|Background: Endometriosis is {{the most}} common {{condition}} underlying infertility in women. To increase the rate of pregnancy in women with endometriosis, embryo selection is performed during in vitro fertilization. This study aims to prove the effectiveness of embryo selection on the rate of pregnancy in a hospital in Jakarta. Methods: This is a cross sectional clinical epidemiology study, performed on endometriosis patients who visited the hospital between 2007 – 2009. Patients were diagnosed with endometriosis using the laparoscopy technique. Embryo selection was performed by assessing the morphology and cell count. Results: We were able to collect data from 72 subjects who underwent IVF during this research period. One subject was dropped out of the program due to immaturity of the oocyte. Successful fertilization was achieved for 65 subjects, but two of them did not undergo embryo transfer. Out of all the subjects undergoing embryo transfer, 26 subjects successfully became pregnant (36. 1 %). In severe endometriosis cases, pregnancy was achieved with excellent quality embryos (50 %) and <b>good-moderate</b> quality embryos (16. 7 %); but the probability of failure to become pregnant was found to be the same (50 %). In mild-moderate endometriosis cases, the probability of pregnancy with excellent quality embryos was 39 % compared to 25 % chance with <b>good-moderate</b> quality embryos. Regarding the number of embryos that were transferred, we have found that the probability of pregnancy was 50 % higher when 3 embryos were transferred, compared to 1 or 2 transferred embryos. Conclusion: This study shows that embryo quality and the number of transferred embryos are relevant to increase the probability of pregnancy in patients undergoing IVF. But because the probability of not achieving pregnancy is not significantly different, we need to find another marker that is more sensitive to assess the quality of embryo transfer.

40|$|Flash-lamp pulsed-dye laser (FPDL) is a nonablative technology, {{typically}} used in vascular malformation therapy {{due to its}} specificity for hemoglobin. FPDL treatments were performed in {{a large group of}} patients with persistent and/or recalcitrant different dermatological lesions with cutaneous microvessel involvement. In particular, 149 patients (73 males and 76 females) were treated. They were affected by the following dermatological disorders: angiokeratoma circumscriptum, genital and extragenital viral warts, striae rubrae, basal cell carcinoma, Kaposi’s sarcoma, angiolymphoid hyperplasia, and Jessner-Kanof disease. They all underwent various laser sessions. 89 patients (59. 7 %) achieved excellent clearance, 32 patients (21. 4 %) achieved <b>good-moderate</b> clearance, 19 patients (12. 7 %) obtained slight clearance, and 9 subjects (6. 1 %) had low or no removal of their lesion. In all cases, FPDL was found to be a safe and effective treatment for the abovementioned dermatological lesions in which skin microvessels play a role in pathogenesis or development. Further and single-indication studies, however, are required to assess a standardized and reproducible method for applying this technology to “off-label” indications...|$|E
40|$|Objective: In {{this study}} we {{compared}} the early prognosis of acute ischemic stroke patients by using Rankin scale, try to find value over the prognosis. Patients were classified according to the NIH stroke scale and TOAST classification. Method: 1022 patients included in the study. Groups according to the NIH scale were calssified as, 0 - 6 points: mild-moderate, 7 - 15 points; moderate-severe, 16 - 42 points; severe-very severe. Neurologic status after 2 weeks were evaluated by Rankin scale and groups were defined as, 0 - 1; excellent, 2 - 3; <b>good-moderate,</b> 4 - 5; poor. Statistical analysis made by using chisquere, kruskal-Wallis and pearson corelation scale tesis. Results: Almost all patients whose NIH stroke scale score {{were found to be}} low initially, had had a excellent or good early prognosis. Apart from this, patients who were classified as lacunar subgroup according to TOAST classification, had had a better early prognosis than the other TOAST subgroups. Conclusion: Initial NIH stroke scale scores evaluated at the acute term were found to be very effective in prediction of the early prognosis. Early NIH score will be usefull in acut treatment of the patient and choosing new treatment strategies...|$|E
40|$|Etanercept (ETN) is an anti-tumour {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) -α agent used in {{rheumatoid arthritis}} (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Few studies {{focused on the}} effects of anti-TNF-α on peripheral blood cells. We aimed to evaluate peripheral blood cells in RA and PsA patients during ETN treatment and to explore their relationships with disease activity. RA (n[*]=[*] 82) and PsA (n[*]=[*] 32) patients who started ETN were included into the study and evaluated prospectively before the beginning of ETN therapy and after 14, 22, 54 and 102 weeks. Patients were studied in terms of disease activity score on 28 joints (DAS 28), clinical response and laboratory findings. Natural killer (NK) cells, B cells and T cells were characterized by immunophenotyping. Both the RA and the PsA patients showed reduced NK and B cell count before ETN treatment compared with controls. A negative correlation was demonstrated between DAS 28 and B cell count in RA patients at baseline. Sustained significant increase of NK and B cells up to normal levels was observed in RA and PsA patients along ETN treatment. Increase of NK cell count was associated with a <b>good-moderate</b> clinical response to ETN in both RA and PsA patients. During ETN treatment peripheral blood NK and B cells levels were restored in RA and PsA patients. Correlations between NK and B cells with disease activity were observed, suggesting that those effects could be mediated by ETN treatment.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, are {{rendered}} {{the results of}} the research referring to the conservation status of the grasslands from two sites ‘Natura 2000 ’ located in Oltenia region, in South-Western part of Romania: ROSCI 0202 Oltenia Forest Steppe and ROSCI 0039 Ciuperceni - Desa. Within these sites, there are five habitats: 62 C 0 * Ponto-Sarmatic steppes, 6260 * Pannonic sand steppes, 6440 Alluvial meadows of river valleys of the Cnidion dubii, 6510 Lowland hay meadows (Alopecurus pratensis, Sanguisorba officinalis) and 1530 * Pannonic salt steppes and salt marshes. The investigation of the conservation status of these habitats was carried out by assessing their conservation status at EU level, namely by assigning them to one of the four categories – “favourable”, “unfavourable-inadequate”, “unfavourable-bad”, and “unknown” – according to the stated attributes for each habitat, to the threats of destruction and to the dangers that may lead to their destruction or disappearance. By applying the evaluation matrix of the conservation state of the five habitats from the two sites Natura 2000, only three of the five studied habitats have a good conservation status: 62 C 0 * Ponto-Sarmatic steppes, 6260 * Pannonic sand steppes, 6440 alluvial meadows of river valleys of the Cnidion dubii. The habitat 1530 * Pannonic salt steppes and salt marshes have a <b>good-moderate</b> status while 6510 Lowland hay meadows (Alopecurus pratensis, Sanguisorba officinalis) has amoderate-poor status. Referring to the characteristic structure and functions to the type of habitat, the research revealed that in numerous areas occupied by the five habitats good conservation conditions are not good. </p...|$|E
40|$|The European Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /EC) commits the Member States of the European Union to {{classify}} the ecological {{status of their}} surface waters using biological assessment methods. The harmonisation of the good ecological status between Member States {{is done in the}} intercalibration exercise. This doctoral thesis comprises the analysis of basic intercalibration approaches and includes results of the first intercalibration phase. In Chapter 1 the direct comparison of invertebrate-based methods is explored. By means of correlation analyses various biological indices are matched for eight countries sharing two common stream types. The outcomes reveal strong relationships between methods, but deviating definitions of the good ecological status. Supportive environmental data is used to illustrate the level of anthropogenic pressure associated with the respective <b>good-moderate</b> boundary of each national method. In search of the most suitable way for comparing national classifications two differing intercalibration options are studied in Chapter 2. The results show that national macrophyte methods are conceptually different: Divergences in the detection of pressures (nutrient enrichment versus unspecific stresses) and the definition of the natural reference state become evident. Chapter 3 identifies the similarities of national methods to establish common grounds in macrophyte intercalibration. The method comparison is enabled by delineating indicator taxa that are used in a common metric for macrophytes. Chapter 4 includes the comparison of ecological classifications for five Eastern European countries. Common metrics are applied in the intercalibration of national methods using benthic diatoms and invertebrates. Since the availability of data from undisturbed reference sites is generally scarce, an alternative approach based on sites impacted by similar levels of disturbance is employed. The biological benchmarks derived from these sites set transnational reference points for the harmonization of national status classifications...|$|E
