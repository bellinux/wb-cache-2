40|$|The {{opening session}} {{included}} two papers. The first paper by Gordon Tullock advanced doubts {{on the ability}} of the European Central Bank to control inflation. The second paper was by Giancarlo Gandolfo who presented a joint paper written with Daniela Federici that examined the consequences of building a new theoretical model where endogenous growth and the NATREX concept are integrated. The second session included two papers. The first paper was by Peter Bernholz who discussed indebtedness and deficits in EU countries and pointed out that what we perceive as improvements in the EU financial situation is only partly attributable to the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. The session ended with a paper by Kwan Choi on optimal tariffs in the financing of a public input that the government can produce either directly or by purchasing the public input produced by the private sector. He argued that due to the distortionary nature of tariffs private production of the public input could result in higher tariffs. On Friday, May 18 th, there were sessions in the morning and afternoon. The opening session started with a paper by Giuseppe Eusepi. He argued that the future European scenarios will depend on whether it is chosen tax harmonization or tax competition. The second paper of the session was by Marco Buti. Buti traced the vicissitudes that have led to the present EMU and pointed out that a successful EMU will depend on its credibility. The last morning session included two papers. The first by Daniele Franco and Fabrizio Balassone. By reviewing the literature on budgetary rules, the authors tried to assess whether the EMU issues on public finance are to be regarded as innovative or not. They emphasized the contrast between the need for supranational fiscal rules for the EU and fiscal responsibility, which is still in the hands of national governments. A paper followed by Rolf Strauch and Juergen von Hagen. Strauch discussed the role of formal fiscal restraints and the feasibility limits that they involve. By drawing on US experience, where balance budget requirements have existed for decades, the paper argued that the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact could reveal themselves as not sufficiently tight restraints. The first afternoon session started with a paper by Bruno Frey and Alois Stutzer. Revisiting the Benthamite theory of utility, Frey introduced the concept of procedural utility and argued that outcome utility and process utility can be distinguished and empirically measured. The second paper was by Geoffrey Brennan. Brennan examined the political economy of regulation, which has {{an important role in the}} EU agenda, and discussed the pros and cons of a regulation/budgetary substitution. In the second afternoon session Daniela Federici and Raffaella Sadun analyzed the role of fiscal policy on the current account balance and proposed an alternative econometric approach to the standard Obstfeld Rogoff model. The last paper was by Martin Paldam. Using an Edgeworth Box, he argued that a small country such as Denmark takes advantages of the unification process. Such advantages are, however, different depending on whether they are evaluated by the élites or by population in general. On Saturday, May 19 th, there were only two sessions in the morning. The first session started with a paper by Charles Beat Blankart and Dennis Mueller that outlined two alternative parliamentary models: the model of a pure representative democracy and that of a pure two-party competition. Blankart argued that in reality only mixed systems can be found, and observed that reforms should lead towards the one or the other of the basic models. Christoph Schaltegger presented a joint paper written with Dominique Kuttel that discussed the central role that institutions play on political decisions and drew on Swiss data involving twenty years to argue that competitive fiscal institutions induce local governments to mutually limit fiscal pressure. Friedrich Schneider presented a paper that discussed the challenge posed to international monetary institutions after the Asian crises. In particular he suggested a more powerful <b>international</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>institution</b> acting as a central bank that should fully replace national monetary institutions during crises. The final paper was by Pier Carlo Padoan. By using an evolutionary approach, he emphasized how groundless the early critiques of EMU in terms of feasibility and efficiency are. He reported that the European monetary system has generally worked quite well despite the pressure of both external shocks and internal imbalances. Giuseppe Eusepi closed the conference with his hope that it might lead to further investigation on the questions raised. He expressed gratitude to the speakers for the high quality of the papers, to the discussants for their lively and informed comments. He warmly congratulated the chairmen on their efforts in ensuring that the rules on presentation/discussion time were followed. He pointed out that during the three days the air was one of informality, but no one forgot for a minute the scientific rigor...|$|E

For at least one century, international arbitrations have remarkably settled conflicts between private enterprises with costly but not insurmountable endeavors.

40|$|Excerpt] Although {{it is now}} {{two decades}} since the United Nations’ International Year of Disabled People, {{disabled}} people across the world still encounter severe economic, cultural and social deprivations. The problem is generally worse for those living in rural areas and is especially acute for all disabled people living in low income states. Clearly, health and rehabilitation {{can no longer be}} understood solely in terms of orthodox medical interventions and conventional notions of ‘care’. These centre almost exclusively on the perceived limitations of individuals rather than on society’s failure to accommodate disabled peoples’ needs. There is, therefore, an urgent need for an approach that cares not simply about disabled people but also about society and the way it is organized. Responding to this insight, the WHO ‘Rethinking Care’ initiative and Conference brought together disabled people and other stakeholders from high and low income countries to identify key issues and propose recommendations for member states to address this need. Recommendations included the recognition that member nations must adopt a holistic approach that includes the introduction of policies to eliminate poverty and secure equal access to all community based services and facilities. These include medical services, education, employment, housing, transport, public amenities etc. This must be accompanied by the introduction of comprehensive and enforceable anti-discrimination laws and policies to secure the active and meaningful involvement of disabled people and their organizations in all future policy developments. States must adopt a truly inclusive approach to these issues that addresses the needs of all disabled people equally. This includes disabled women, disabled children, and people with complex and/or multiple impairments with potentially high dependency needs. Access to medical and related services is a basic human right must not be determined by the ability to pay. With this in mind several important and practical recommendations were devised for the future implementation of the first four UN Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities. These concern medical, rehabilitation, and support services and awareness raising campaigns. Finally, the responsibility for introducing and financing these developments rests with national governments. But where necessary high-income states, <b>international</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>institutions</b> and transnational organizations, should make resources available to the governments of low-income countries to secure the successful implementation of these initiatives...|$|R

40|$|In small open economies, {{external}} factors exert a strong {{influence on the}} autonomy and efficiency of domestic monetary policies. For the Czech National Bank, no exchange rate regime can guarantee a lasting degree of policy autonomy. Within the present CNB's strategy of direct inflation targeting, changes of exchange rate and of world prices proved especially hard to tackle. In 1998 and 1999, a substantially faster disinflation took place than was presupposed by CNB's own inflation targets. This helped to throw the economy into a recession. A credit crunch subsequently set out of function the most important transmission channel of monetary policy. Inflation targets were repeatedly undershot, and only a strong capital inflow initiated the money supply growth for economic recovery. A lower level of ambition to steer the economy via autonomous monetary policy is probably desirable.

40|$|Rumors {{about the}} actual or {{potential}} currency diversification of countries’ foreign exchange holdings out of dollars are not a new phenomenon. This working paper argues that such concerns about reserve diversification are exaggerated. We present evidence that the extent of actual diversification has been modest to date. Nevertheless, the potential for reserve diversification adds volatility to foreign exchange markets and can catalyze abrupt exchange rate movements. We argue that policymakers acting in their own national interests can do something constructive to reduce the volatility introduced into foreign exchange and financial markets by rumors of large-scale international foreign exchange reserve diversification. We propose the voluntary adoption by major foreign exchange reserve holders in particular of an International Reserve Diversification Standard consisting of two elements: (1) routine disclosure of the currency composition of official foreign exchange holdings and (2) a commitment by each adherent to adjust gradually the actual currency composition of its reserves to any new benchmark for those holdings.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine how {{monetary}} integration affects the exchange rate pass-through, by testing whether monetary policy convergence in the euro area led to a convergence in terms of exchange rate pass-through. We conduct a comparative study between the "experiment group" (the euro area) and the "control group" (non-euro industrial countries). We find evidence for stronger convergence of exchange rate pass-through for the euro area economies as a group, especially around the 1980 s. The group of non-euro industrial countries also had conditional convergence (convergence with permanent cross-sectional heterogeneity) in exchange rate pass-through, but its cross-sectional dispersion remains substantially larger compared to the euro area. This indicates that monetary integration affects the exchange rate pass-through. This has an important policy implication for the euro area, especially for the new member countries, as their exchange rate pass-through would not remain constant or purely exogenous; it should also converge to the euro area average as they work to achieve the Maastricht Criteria.

40|$|The {{main tasks}} of central banks are to secure price and {{financial}} stability. These objectives can, {{in times of}} crises, conflict with one another, and the central bank may have to renounce {{one of them in}} order to secure the other. In a monetary union, this trade-off can be exacerbated by the presence of highly indebted countries or by the risk of loose fiscal policies. This paper offers a simple theoretical model that captures the trade-off. Different fiscal institutions are compared in order to evaluate their impact on the conduct of monetary policy. More specifically, the fiscal criteria of the Maastricht Treaty and the Pact for Stability and Growth in Europe are analyzed in light of this model. Fiscal mechanisms exist to help prevent or minimize the risk of fiscal crises and the corresponding risk of central bank financing and inflation.

40|$|There is {{widespread}} agreement {{that during the}} floating exchange rate period from 1970 to the present Canada’s nominal and real exchange rates {{with respect to the}} United States have shown considerable volatility. It has been suggested that the volatility of the real exchange rate would be substantially reduced if the nominal exchange rate with the U.

In all discussions of the fixed verses floating exchange rate question, {{it is important to understand}} why real exchange rates are volatile. The sources of real exchange rate volatility are the focus of this paper. Our findings are that substantial asymmetric real shocks have occurred and were an important determinant of the real exchange rate but there is no evidence of real exchange rate effects of monetary shocks. Since our results indicate that the sources of exchange rate volatility are real, not monetary, they are unfavorable to the adoption by Canada of a common currency with the United States.

40|$|The 1990 s have {{witnessed}} {{an increase of}} international financial turbulence. Indeed, the frequency, the size, the geographic extension, and the social costs of financial crises have made the topic a global policy issue. An array of policy actions have been advocated to prevent crises from happening again. A major controversial question is whether efforts should be directed towards national reforms in emerging markets or, rather, towards a new international design of international payments. After a critical review of the standing proposals, this paper contends that this debate has not yet fully explored {{one of the problems}} of international instability, that is to say, the problem raised by international payments in a world of currencies of diverse quality. As Keynes firmly contended, the monetary side of the (global) economy is not a neutral factor. In fact, it may be the problems posed by the different degrees of “international moneyness” that make currencies unequal that should be considered as one of the fundamental factors behind any model of international financial instability. Viewed in this light, a major re-design of international payments systems is warranted, and options seem limited to either world dollarization or the ‘bancor’ solution. Recent reformulations of Keynes’s original ‘bancor’ proposal seem to be a more viable alternative to either the status quo or world dollarization.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of fiscal and <b>monetary</b> <b>institutions</b> in {{macroeconomic}} stability and budgetary control in central, eastern and south-eastern European countries (CESEE) in comparison with other OECD countries.

The paper develops a Budgetary Discipline Index to assess whether good fiscal institutions underpin good fiscal outcomes. Even though most CESEE countries have low scores, the debt/GDP ratios declined before the crisis. This was largely the consequence of a very favourable relationship between the economic growth rate and the interest rate, but such a favourable relationship is not expected in the future. Econometric estimations confirm that better <b>monetary</b> <b>institutions</b> reduce macroeconomic volatility and that countries with better budgetary procedures have better fiscal outcomes.
