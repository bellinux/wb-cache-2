40|$|<b>International</b> <b>norm</b> {{polarization}} {{is a rare}} but recurring process within <b>international</b> <b>norm</b> dynamics. Polarization {{describes the}} most combative response to attempted norm change: 'a candidate norm is accepted by some states but resisted by others, leading to a period of international disputation between two groups in which socializing pressures pull states toward compliance with rival norms'. We identify several cases of polarization and explain this phenomenon by elaborating the constructivist model of the norm life cycle to processes of <b>international</b> resistance to <b>norm</b> change {{as well as to}} norm acceptance. We also draw on social identity theory (SIT) to examine group-psychological responses where disputed norms become closely linked to state identity. We illustrate these dynamics with reference to conflict over the norm that recognizes sexual orientation and gender identity as subjects of international human rights protection. Over the past decade this candidate norm has become increasingly contentious internationally, and bitter debates over resolutions concerning extra-judicial killings and discrimination have divided the United Nations General Assembly and Human Rights Council. The article makes a primary contribution to analysis of <b>international</b> <b>norm</b> change and also contributes to an emerging literature concerning sexuality and international relations. 35 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{implementation}} of laws recognizing same-sex unions (SSU) {{by a majority of}} western democracies {{over the past two decades}} represents one of the most stunning cases of convergent policy change in recent times. The Same-sex Unions Revolution argues that this wave of SSU policy adoption that occurred across Western Europe and North America in the 1990 s and early 2000 s is, to a significant degree, the product of <b>international</b> <b>norm</b> diffusion and learning. The monograph first traces the creation of a norm for relationship recognition by transnational activists and policymakers within Europe, and describes how the dissemination of this norm has catalyzed policy change across western democracies. The second part of the monograph analyzes policy developments in four countries (USA, Canada, Germany, and the Netherlands) to illustrate how and the extent to which the <b>international</b> <b>norm</b> has shaped national SSU policy debates. This comparative analysis reveals that culture—especially religious values, <b>international</b> <b>norm</b> legitimacy and national conceptions of human rights—has profoundly influenced how countries have received the SSU norm as well as their decisions about whether and what kind of SSU law to adopt (marriage vs. registered partnership vs. unregistered cohabitant) ...|$|R

25|$|Criticism of United States {{foreign policy}} {{encompasses}} {{a wide range}} of opinions and views on failures and shortcoming of United States policies and actions. There is a partly-held sense in America which views America as qualitatively different from other nations and therefore cannot be judged by the same standards as other countries; this belief is sometimes termed American exceptionalism and {{can be traced to the}} so-called Manifest destiny. American exceptionalism has widespread implications and transcribes into disregard to the <b>international</b> <b>norms,</b> rules and laws in U.S. foreign policy. For example, the U.S. refused to ratify a number of important international treaties such as Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and American Convention on Human Rights; did not join the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention; and routinely conducts drone attacks and cruise missile strikes around the globe. American exceptionalism is sometimes linked with hypocrisy; for example, the U.S. keeps a huge stockpile of nuclear weapons while urging other nations not to get them, and justifies that it can make an exception to a policy of non-proliferation.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} developments in international political and legal theory over the last 15 years has been the assertion that norms affect state behavior. Scholars have claimed that states are constrained by norms of appropriate behavior and furthermore that norms actually change ("reconstitute") states' understandings of their interests, thereby leading states to adapt their behavior in accordance with these new understandings.
