[...] It's based on many hotels in Los Angeles... Angel lived in a larger suite in the hotel, like a honeymoon suite, the producers wanted Angel to have enough room to relax and <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> do a little pondering, a little brooding, and a little research. [...] Every once in a while, someone will come up {{to have a little}} conversation." [...] In the final season, the team moves to the evil law firm, Wolfram & Hart.|$|E

60|$|In a {{few minutes}} I was {{laughing}} at myself, not quite naturally, perhaps, but only I could know that. I was {{getting to be a}} morbid, nervous person. It was the solitude! I must <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> before long. Fate had been playing strange tricks with me. Life, which a few months ago had been a cold and barren thing, was suddenly pressed to my lips, a fantastic, intoxicating mixture. I had drawn enough poison into my veins. I would have no more.

60|$|He escaped {{as soon as}} {{possible}} back to his far-off regions, lonely and cheerless, away above. But he rather liked the far-off remoteness in the big old Florentine house: he did not mind the peculiar dark, uncosy dreariness. It was not really dreary: only indifferent. Indifferent to comfort, indifferent to all homeliness and cosiness. The over-big furniture trying to be impressive, but never to be pretty or bright or cheerful. There it stood, ugly and apart. And there let it stand.--Neither did he mind the lack of fire, the cold sombreness of his big bedroom. At home, in England, the bright grate and the ruddy fire, the thick hearth-rug and the man's arm-chair, these had been inevitable. And now he was glad to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> He was glad not to have a cosy hearth, and his own arm-chair. He was glad to feel the cold, and to breathe the unwarmed air. He preferred the Italian way of no fires, no heating. If the day was cold, he was willing to be cold too. If it was dark, he was willing to be dark. The cosy brightness of a real home--it had stifled him till he felt his lungs would burst. The horrors of real domesticity. No, the Italian brutal way was better.|$|E
6000|$|The Wilmington Stocking-Mills spun {{their own}} threads, {{and the first}} room was like what Annie had seen before in cotton factories, with a faint smell of oil from the machinery, and a fine snow of fluff in the air, and {{catching}} to the white-washed walls and the foul window sashes. The tireless machines marched {{back and forth across}} the floor, and the men who watched them with suicidal intensity ran after them barefooted when they made off with a broken thread, spliced it, and then escaped from them to their stations again. In other rooms, where there was a stunning whir of spindles, girls and women were at work; they looked after Lyra and her nephew from under cotton-frowsed bangs; they all seemed to know her, and returned her easy, kindly greetings with an effect of liking. From time to time, at Lyra's bidding, the young fellow explained to Annie some curious feature of the processes; in the room where the stockings were knitted she tried to understand the machinery that wrought and seemed to live before her eyes. But her mind wandered to the men and women who were operating it, and who seemed no more a voluntary part of it than all the rest, except when Jack Wilmington curtly ordered them to do this or that in illustration of some point he was explaining. She wearied herself, as people do in such places, in expressing her wonder at the ingenuity of the machinery; it was a relief to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> into the room, cool and quiet, where half a dozen neat girls were counting and stamping the stockings with different numbers. [...] "Here's where I used to work," [...] said Lyra, [...] "and here's where I first met Mr. Wilmington. The place is full of romantic associations. The stockings are all one size, Annie; but people like to wear different numbers, and so we try to gratify them. Which number do you wear? Or don't you wear the Wilmington machine-knit? I don't. Well, they're not dreams exactly, Annie, when all's said and done for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|But before I {{begin to}} {{describe}} Vissarion I shall throw a sop to you [...] as a chatelaine; that may give you patience {{to read the}} rest. The [...] Castle {{needs a lot of}} things to make it comfortable--as you would [...] consider it. In fact, it is absolutely destitute of everything of a [...] domestic nature. Uncle Roger had it vetted on the defence side, and [...] so far it could stand a siege. But it couldn't cook a dinner or go [...] through a spring-cleaning! As you know, I am not much up in domestic [...] matters, and so I cannot give you details; but you may take it that [...] it wants everything. I don't mean furniture, or silver, or even [...] gold-plate, or works of art, for it is full of the most magnificent [...] old things that you can imagine. I think Uncle Roger must have been [...] a collector, and gathered a lot of good things in all sorts of [...] places, stored them for years, and then sent them here. But as to [...] glass, china, delft, all sorts of crockery, linen, household [...] appliances and machinery, cooking utensils--except of the [...] simplest--there are none. I don't think Uncle Roger could have lived [...] here more than on a temporary picnic. So far as I only am concerned, [...] I am all right; a gridiron and a saucepan are all I want--and I can [...] use them myself. But, dear Aunt Janet, I don't want you to pig it. [...] I would like you to have everything you can imagine, and all of the [...] very best. Cost doesn't count now for us, thanks to Uncle Roger; and [...] so I want you to order all. I know you, dear--being a woman--won't [...] object to shopping. But it will have to be wholesale. This is an [...] enormous place, and will swallow up all you can buy--like a [...] quicksand. Do as you like about choosing, but get all the help you [...] can. Don't be afraid of getting too much. You can't, or of being [...] idle when you are here. I assure you that when you come there will [...] be so much to do and so many things to think of that you will want to [...] <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> And, besides, Aunt Janet, I hope you won't be [...] too long. Indeed, I don't wish to be selfish, but your boy is [...] lonely, and wants you. And when you get here you will be an EMPRESS. [...] I don't altogether like doing so, lest I should offend a [...] millionairess like you; but it may facilitate matters, and the way's [...] of commerce are strict, though devious. So I send you a cheque for [...] 1,000 pounds for the little things: and a letter to the bank to [...] honour your own cheques for any amount I have got.|$|E
