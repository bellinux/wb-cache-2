Professional clubs also usually display players' surnames or nicknames on their shirts, above (or, infrequently, below) their squad numbers.|$|E

However, D. violacea <b>has</b> <b>generally</b> been recognized as belonging to its own genus Pteroplatytrygon, and recently D. kuhlii has also been placed in a different genus, Neotrygon.|$|E

In addition, the later novella A War of Gifts and novel Ender's Shadow take place {{during the same time}} period as the original.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{is found}} in residential areas throughout its range. Backyard birders attract it using feeders containing Nyjer thistle seed, or by planting grasses and perennial plants, such as zinnias, cosmos, bee balm, or globe thistle, which produce seedheads favored by finches. Although some controversy surrounds bird feeding (see bird feeder for details), an increase in backyard feeding by humans <b>has</b> <b>generally</b> been beneficial to this species.|$|E

The conductor Sir Adrian Boult heard Fauré play the piano version several times and noted that he took it at a tempo no slower than crochet=100. Boult commented that the composer's sprightly tempo emphasised that the Pavane was not a piece of German romanticism.|$|E
