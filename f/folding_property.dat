40|$|Two-dimensional {{nonlinear}} {{models of}} conservative dynamics are typically nonuniformly hyperbolic {{in that there}} are nonhyperbolic trajectories that coexist with a "massive" hyperbolic region. We investigate the influence of nonhyperbolic points on the global geometric structure of a invariant manifolds associated with points of the hyperbolic region. As a case study, we consider a transformation of the Standard Map family and analyze the structure of invariant manifolds {{in the neighborhood of}} an isolated parabolic (fixed) point x(p). This analysis shows the existence of lobes enclosing the parabolic point, that is, of simply connected regions containing x(p) whose boundary is formed by two continuous arcs of stable and unstable manifolds that intersect only at two points. From the existence of such regions, we derive that (i) there are points of the hyperbolic region where the local curvature of invariant manifolds is arbitrarily large and (ii) manifolds possess the recursively <b>folding</b> <b>property.</b> Property (ii) means that given an invariant manifold W and established an orientation on it, in the neighborhood of any point of the chaotic region there are nearby arcs of W that are traveled in opposite directions. We propose an archetypal model for which the existence of lobes and the recursive <b>folding</b> <b>property</b> can be derived analytically. The impact of nonuniform hyperbolicity on the evolution of physical processes that occur along with phase space mixing is also addressed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Surprisingly, the presence of phosphatidic acid (PA) had a much larger effect on the stability of KcsA and this lipid, in addition, significantly influenced the <b>folding</b> <b>properties</b> of the protein.

Also, the effects of ATP and phosphorylation on the affinity of hNopp 140 to doxorubicin are investigated by affinity dependent co-precipitation and surface plasmon resonance methods. Doxorubicin preferentially binds to un-phosphorylated form of hNopp 140 with a K D value of 3. 3 × 10 − 7 M. Furthermore, doxorubicin reduces the protein kinase CK 2 -dependent phosphorylation of hNopp 140, indicating that doxorubicin may perturb the cellular function of hNopp 140 by reducing the protein kinase CK 2 -dependent phosphorylation of hNopp 140.

Here, in vitro techniques were used to analyze MBP, RBP, RBP-MBP (RBP signal and MBP mature), and MBP-RBP (MBP signal and RBP mature). In protease-protection experiments, RBP folded considerably faster than MBP, RBP-MBP, or MBP-RBP. Only the <b>folding</b> <b>properties</b> of proteins containing the MBP mature moiety were influenced by SecB.

A non-linear relation between sequence data and their RQA representation was revealed, which points to new information carried by this method as compared with classical best-alignment methods. This new information is significantly correlated with the <b>folding</b> <b>properties</b> of the hybrid polypeptide chains, as substantiated by careful statistical analysis of the recurrence plots' numerical descriptors, thus encouraging their systematic use to complement sequence data in both proteomics and protein engineering tasks.

40|$|AbstractThere is {{a debate}} on the folding of {{proteins}} with inverted sequences. Theoretical approaches and experiments give contradictory results. Many proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) show conspicuous inverse sequence similarity (ISS) to each other. Here we analyze whether this ISS is related to structural similarity. For the first time, we performed a large scale three-dimensional (3 -D) superposition of corresponding Cα atoms of forwardly and inversely aligned proteins and tested the degree of secondary structure identity between them. Comparing proteins of less than 50 % pairwise sequence identity, only 0. 5 % of the inversely aligned pairs had similar folds (99 out of 19   073), whereas about 9 % of forwardly aligned proteins in the same score and length range show similar 3 -D structures (1731 out of 19   248). This observation strongly supports {{the view that the}} inversion of sequences in almost all cases leads to a different <b>folding</b> <b>property</b> of the protein.

40|$|The two‐dimensional {{supersonic}} irrotational flow {{of a gas}} in a jet is {{studied by}} use of the Kármán‐Tsien pressure‐volume law. There are two limitations to such a study: (1) since the fluid flow is not continued from the subsonic range, arbitrary boundary conditions must be prescribed; (2) use of the Kármán‐Tsien pressure‐volume relation implies a restriction on the permissible range of pressure, density, and velocity. On the other hand, use of the Kármán‐Tsien law furnishes several advantages: (1) the velocity potential and stream function satisfy the wave equation in the hodograph plane and hence these functions can be easily determined; (2) the mappings between the physical and hodograph planes may be completely characterized and studied in detail. This gain in information should be valuable in the qualitative understanding of phenomena {{as well as in}} obtaining first approximations to quantitative solutions. In the case of jets, with free stream lines as boundaries, it is shown that two functions possessing certain desired properties completely determine the Kármán‐Tsien flow. Further, the phenomenon of the periodic recurrence of the free stream jet boundary is explained by a <b>folding</b> <b>property</b> of the map of the flow in the hodograph plane...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which a protein folds into its characteristic 3 D structure from a random coil {{is known as the}} protein folding process. Understanding the protein folding process is a grand challenge in molecular and structural biology. Most of the existing methods use scalar measurements such as radius of gyration but fail {{to take into account the}} substructural details. Furthermore, the secondary structure based methods cannot characterize the <b>folding</b> <b>properties</b> of the molecule. To overcome these limitations, this thesis presents a novel approach to study the folding process by characterizing the global structure of a protein molecule based on the local substructures identified in the molecule. These local substructures, termed as Folding-Aware Structure-Consious (FASC) Substructures, are derived by enriching secondary structures with the geometric and the <b>folding</b> <b>properties</b> of the molecule. The applications of these FASC Substructures include identification of structurally similar conformations and identification of recurring subsequences of the FASC Substructures across multiple trajectories...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that a “near-Levinthal” cooperative mechanism, whereby the common Gō interaction scheme is augmented by an extra favorability for the native state as a whole, can lead to apparent two-state folding/unfolding kinetics over {{a broad range of}} native stabilities in lattice models of proteins. Here such a mechanism is shown to be generalizable to a simplified continuum (off-lattice) Langevin dynamics model with a Cα protein chain representation, with the resulting chevron plots exhibiting an extended quasilinear regime reminiscent of that of apparent two-state real proteins. Similarly high degrees of cooperativity are possible in Gō-like continuum models with rudimentary pairwise desolvation barriers as well. In these models, cooperativity increases with increasing desolvation barrier height, suggesting strongly that two-state-like folding/unfolding kinetics would be achievable when the pairwise desolvation barrier becomes sufficiently high. Besides cooperativity, another generic <b>folding</b> <b>property</b> of interest that has emerged from published experiments on several apparent two-state proteins is that their folding relaxation under constant native stability (isostability) conditions is essentially Arrhenius, entailing high intrinsic enthalpic folding barriers of ∼ 17 – 30 kcal/mol. Based on a new analysis of published data on barnase, here we propose that a similar property should also apply to a certain class of non-two-state proteins that fold with chevron rollovers. However, several continuum Gō-like constructs considered here fail to predict any significant intrinsic enthalpic folding barrier under isostability conditions; thus the physical origin of such barriers in real proteins remains to be elucidated...|$|E

It measures the average rotation of tangent vectors under {{the action of the}} derivative of the map along that orbit, and characterizes the degree of complexity of the dynamics. The aim {{of this paper is to}} give new insights into the definition and properties of the twist number, and to relate its range to the order properties of periodic orbits. We derive an algorithm to deduce the exact value or a demi [...] unit interval containing the exact value of the twist number. We prove that at a period-doubling bifurcation threshold of a mini-maximizing periodic orbit, the new born doubly periodic orbit has the absolute twist number larger than the absolute twist of the original orbit after bifurcation. We give examples of periodic orbits having large absolute twist number, that are badly ordered, and illustrate how characterization of these orbits only by their residue can lead to incorrect results. In connection to the study of the twist number of periodic orbits of standard [...] like maps we introduce a new tool, called 1 -cone function. We prove that the location of minima of this function with respect to the vertical symmetry lines of a standard-like map encodes a valuable information on the symmetric periodic orbits and their twist number.

40|$|The Ysc type III {{secretion}} {{system allows}} Yersinia enterocolitica to translocate virulence proteins, called Yop effectors, into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. Some of the Yop effectors possess an individual chaperone called a Syc protein. The first 15 amino acids of the YopE effector constitute a secretion signal that {{is sufficient to}} promote secretion of several reporter proteins. Residues 15 - 50 of YopE comprise the minimal binding domain for the SycE chaperone. In this study, we investigated the secretion by the Ysc system of several YopE-DHFR hybrid proteins with different <b>folding</b> <b>properties,</b> and evaluated the role of SycE, the cognate chaperone of YopE, in this context. We have analysed the secretion of hybrids containing 16 (YopE 16), 52 (YopE 52) and 80 (the complete region covered by the chaperone, YopE 80) amino acids of YopE or full-length YopE (YopEFL) with wild-type DHFR and two mutants with altered <b>folding</b> <b>properties.</b> The hybrids containing DHFR delta 77, the mutant whose <b>folding</b> <b>properties</b> are the most drastically affected, could be secreted in all the conditions tested, {{even in the absence}} of the chaperone SycE. In contrast, DHFRwt could only be secreted fused to the first 52 amino acids of YopE, and its secretion was strictly dependent on SycE. The hybrids YopE 80 -DHFRwt and YopEFL-DHFRwt were not secreted. YopEFL-DHFRwt completely jammed the channel in an SycE-dependent fashion. Our experiments indicate that, in order to be secreted, proteins must be unfolded or only partially folded, and that TSS chaperones could keep their substrates in a secretion-competent conformation, probably by preventing their folding. In addition, they show that the secretion apparatus can reject folded proteins if they are not deeply engaged into the injectisome...|$|R

The GSTs in mosquito Anopheles dirus species B, an important malaria vector in South East Asia, are of interest because they can play an important role in insecticide resistance. In the present study, we characterized the Anopheles dirus (Ad) GST D 3 - 3 which is an alternatively spliced product of the adgst 1 AS 1 gene. The data from the crystal structure of GST D 3 - 3 shows that Ile- 52, Glu- 64, Ser- 65, Arg- 66 and Met- 101 interact directly with glutathione. To study the active-site function of these residues, alanine substitution site-directed mutagenesis was performed resulting in five mutants: I 52 A (Ile- 52 →Ala), E 64 A, S 65 A, R 66 A and M 101 A. Interestingly, the E 64 A mutant was expressed in Escherichia coli in inclusion bodies, suggesting that this residue is involved with the tertiary structure or <b>folding</b> <b>property</b> of this enzyme. However, the I 52 A, S 65 A, R 66 A and M 101 A mutants were purified by glutathione affinity chromatography and the enzyme activity characterized. On the basis of steady-state kinetics, difference spectroscopy, unfolding and refolding studies, it was concluded that these residues: (1) contribute to the affinity of the GSH-binding site (‘G-site’) for GSH, (2) influence GSH thiol ionization, (3) participate in kcat regulation by affecting the rate-limiting step of the reaction, and in the case of Ile- 52 and Arg- 66, influenced structural integrity and/or folding of the enzyme. The structural perturbations from these mutants are probably transmitted to the hydrophobic-substrate-binding site (‘H-site’) through changes in active site topology or through effects on GSH orientation. Therefore these active site residues appear to contribute to various steps in the catalytic mechanism, as well as having an influence on the packing of the protein...|$|E

These studies have identified the kinetically favorable telomere G- quadruplex (GQ) structure, revealed the mechanical unfolding pathway of telomere GQ, and characterized the mechanical properties of duplex telomere DNA and the formation of the telomere D-loop. Telomeres are specialize DNA sequence that prevent degradation and aberrant fusion of chromosome ends. The foundation of human telomeres consists of 5 - 10 kb of duplex TTAGGG repeats follow by a 50 to 200 nucleotides of 3 ' single stranded overhang. The G-rich single stranded telomere has a propensity to fold into a secondary structure known as GQ. In Chapter 2, single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) was used for constructing the distribution of telomere DNA GQ conformations under physiological salt conditions. With circular dichroism, the kinetic trapped GQ conformation was discovered. In Chapter 3, smFRET and magnetic tweezers (MT) was used to dissect the <b>folding</b> <b>property</b> telomere GQ. Under stretching force, the unfolding pathway of telomere GQ was characterized by a distance less than 1 nm. In Chapter 4, the magnetic tweezers assay revealed that telomere is more resistant to torque-induced denaturation. The direct observation of telomere strand invasion suggested that the stretching force can influence the rate of the invasion and the formation of the telomere displacement loop. The subsequent chapters detail the setup and experimental protocol for the MT-FRET, and describe how to use MT to manipulate DNA. These single molecule assays setup a foundation for investigating the interaction between the telomere and its associated proteins and serve as an experimental platform for telomere drug assessment.

40|$|Structure Determination of Human Cytoplasmic Neu 2 　To date, l 3 {{mammalian}} sialidases {{have been}} cloned including four from humans. So far, only some bac-terial and viral neuraminidase 2 ̆ 7 s structures are known, nothing from human or mammals. In this study, the crystal {{structure of the}} human cytosolic sialidase Neu 2 was determined at the atomic level, either in an apo form or in complex with diverse inhibitors of substrate of reaction. 　The core of the enzyme folds as a six-bladed β-propeller with 26 β-strands and five α-helices, typical of viral and bacterial sialidases. Neu 2 adopts an irregular six-bladed structure caused by β-bulges of the third strand, as well as longer β-stands compared to the "classical" propeller foldings. 　In the Neu 2 -DANA complex structure, 2 -deoxy- 2, 3 -dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (DANA) lies in a half-chair conformation interacting with 10 amino acids of the active site. Interaction between Neu 2 and the inhibitor DANA shows similarities with bacterial and viral counterparts but also exhibits some differences in the active site arrangement and dynamic nature of the loops containing residues respon-sible for catalysis and substrate recognition An acidic crevice {{at the center of}} the β-propeller forms an activating core for the enzymatic catalysis and the basic residues at the mouth of the crevice coordinate substrates. 　Two loops are disordered on the top side of the apo form Neu 2 : one contains Glu 111 important for the substrate binding, and the other Asp 46 for the catalysis. Soaking the apo form crystals with monosaccharide such as galactose, glucose, or maltose orders the former loop into α 2, illustrating a plausible two steps model for a dynamic in the substrate recognition. 　In the Neu 2 structures, two Asp-boxes STDHGRTW (residues 129 - 136) and SHDHGRTW (residues 199 - 206) are easily identified (where boldface letters indicate residues structurally important for Asp-boxes). A third Asp-box STNDGLDF (residues 248 - 255) was found to have similar <b>folding</b> <b>property</b> comparing with the two firsts. The sequence of the third Asp-box in Neu 2 extends the consensus se-quence of Asp-boxes as Ser-X-(Asp/Gln) -X-Gly-X-(Thr/Asp) -〓, where 〓stands for aromatic residues. A new screening may therefore give further insights into the function of these structural elements. 　Finally, different crystal forms of the sialidase have been refined in order to facilitate inhibitors screenings. The influenza virus neuraminidase plays a critical role in the life cycle of the virus and has been the focus of new drug developments. Drug design of new agents against the viral sialidase comes from the fact that whereas diverse kinds of influenza virus neuraminidases were identified, their catalytic site is completely conserved among all influenza subtypes in terms of amino acids organization. To date, no data exist on whether the human sialidases can interact as well with viral and/or bacterial targeting drugs. To answer this question, complex structures of Neu 2 with overall six different influenza virus in-hibitors have been solved, illustrating the inhibitors lying in the human sialidase active site coordinated in a similar way. By comparing tle recognition mechanism of each inhibitor, in Neu 2 or in influenza virus neuraminidase, new drug design studies might be started in order to preferentially recognize either human or viral sialidases. 　Biochemical and Crystallographic Studies on Rab 27 a/b and Their Effectors 　The integrity of eukaryotic cells stongly depends on membrane traffic, which is tightly linked to the regulation by a number of protein families such as Ras, Rho, Rab and Ran. Those proteins bind to var-ious types of effector proteins, and execute versatile functions. More precisely, the Rab 27 subfamily, consisting of Rab 27 a and Rab 27 b, is directly implicated in the hansport of lysosome-related organelles, such as melanosomes in melanocytes or lytic granules in cytotoxic T-lymphorytes. In order to clarify the regulation process of such transport phenomena, biochemical and crystallization experiments have been carried out on both Rab 27 a/b, alone and in complex with two effectors Slac 2 -a and Slp 4 -a. 　The individual GTPases, Rab 27 a and Rab 27 b, were purified for suitable crystallization experiments, both in their active (GTP-bound) or inactive (GDP-bound) forms. Extensive crystallization screenings have been performed, resulting in the apparition of some protein diffracting crystals in diverse conditions for Rab 27 b in its inactive form. The crystals grew in a tetragonal space group but did not diffract at higher resolution than 4. 2 Å. Seleno-methionine substituted Rab 27 b protein was then purified and crystallized, but the crystal 2 ̆ 7 s diffraction limit did not improve. Further refinements in terms of protein deletion mutants and crystallization are now under way in order to obtain highly diffracting crystals. 　The complexes between the GTPases and their effectors, respectively Slac 2 -a and Slp 4 -a, could be generated and purified, and have been subjects of intensive crystallization trials with the help of a crystallization robot.

We {{find that in}} the free-energy landscape the barrier height (G(double dagger)) and transition distance (x(double dagger)) are dependent on the loading rate (r) along the pulling direction, x, as predicted by Bell. The barrier shifted toward the initial state, whereas Delta G(double dagger) reduced significantly from 50 to 5 kT, as r increased from 0 to 32 pN/s. However, the equilibrium work (Delta G) during strand separation, as estimated by Crook's fluctuation theorem, remained unchanged at different rates.

The selection is based on two properties of misfolded proteins: (1) increased sensitivity to proteolysis and (2) greater exposure of hydrophobic area. By targeting these properties, we show that compactly folded and soluble proteins can be enriched over insoluble and random coil proteins. This approach may be especially useful for selection and evolution of folded proteins from random sequence libraries...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the time}} of {{structural}} proteomics when protein structures are targeted on a genome-wide scale, the detection of “well-behaved” proteins that would yield good quality NMR spectra or X-ray images {{is the key to}} high-throughput structure determination. Already, simple one-dimensional proton NMR spectra provide enough information for assessing the <b>folding</b> <b>properties</b> of proteins. Heteronuclear two-dimensional spectra are routinely used for screenings that reveal structural, as well as binding, properties of proteins. NMR can thus provide important information for optimizing conditions for protein constructs that are amenable to structural studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} developed Spring Back Reflector has low stiffness in the deployed config-uration. A general method of stiffening {{this type of}} reflector without changing its <b>folding</b> <b>properties</b> is presented. The stiffening is achieved by adding a conical skirt {{around the edge of}} the dish; this skirt snaps elastically when the dish is folded. The paper concludes that it is possible to design spring back reflectors that are up to 80 times stiffer and with a deployed fundamental frequency up to 8 times higher than in the original design...|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} dynamical-parameter algortihms are discussed, simulated tempering and the multisequence method. Using simulated tempering, the <b>folding</b> <b>properties</b> of 300 random sequences in {{a simple}} off-lattice model with only two amino-acid types, hydrophobic and hydrophilic, are investigated. A careful statistical analysis shows that the hydrophobic monomers are anticorrelated along the chains for good folding sequences. The multisequence method {{is the basis for}} a novel procedure for maximizing the stability of a given target structure. Tests of this sequence design procedure on the HP lattice model show that it can be extremely efficient. ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Spanish" [...] {{grade is}} usually {{regarded}} as the higher-quality, while the [...] "Tripoli" [...] grade, from Africa, is the lesser in quality. The fibers are fairly short {{in relation to their}} width, yet do not create any significant amount of dust. Because of the short fiber length, the tensile strength of the paper is less than that of many other papers, but its resistance to shrinkage and stretching is superior, and the paper is a well-filled, dense paper with excellent inking qualities. It also has very good <b>folding</b> <b>properties.</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in coarse-grained lattice and off-lattice protein models are reviewed. The sequence dependence of thermodynamical <b>folding</b> <b>properties</b> are investigated and evidence for non-randomness of the binary sequences of good folders are discussed. Similar patterns for non-randomness are found for real proteins. Dynamical parameter MC methods, {{such as the}} tempering and multisequence algorithms, are essential {{in order to obtain}} these results. Also, a new MC method for design, the inverse of folding, is presented. Here, one maximizes conditional probabilities rather than minimizing energies. By construction, this method ensures that the designed sequences represent good folders thermodynamically. 1...|$|R
