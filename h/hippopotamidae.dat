50|$|The {{most popular}} {{theory of the}} origins of <b>Hippopotamidae</b> {{suggests}} that hippos and whales shared a common ancestor that branched off from other artiodactyls around 60 million years ago (mya). This hypothesized ancestral group likely split into two branches around 54 mya. One branch would evolve into cetaceans, possibly beginning about 52 mya, with the protowhale Pakicetus and other early whale ancestors collectively known as Archaeoceti, which eventually underwent aquatic adaptation into the completely aquatic cetaceans. The other branch became the anthracotheres, and all branches of the anthracotheres, except that which evolved into <b>Hippopotamidae,</b> became extinct during the Pliocene without leaving any descendants. River dolphins are thought to have relictual distributions, that is, their ancestors originally occupied marine habitats, but were then displaced from these habitats by modern dolphin lineages. Many of the morphological similarities and adaptations to freshwater habitats arose due to convergent evolution; thus, a grouping of all river dolphins is paraphyletic. For example, Amazon river dolphins are actually more closely related to oceanic dolphins than to South Asian river dolphins.|$|E

Some studies have found Andrewsarchus, once considered a Mesonychid to form the sister group to the clade composed of Cetacea and <b>Hippopotamidae</b> along with Entelodontidae.

50|$|The pygmy hippo is reclusive and nocturnal.

50|$|However, the {{earliest}} known anthracotheres appear in the fossil record in the middle Eocene, well after the archaeocetes had taken up totally aquatic lifestyles.

40|$|International audienceThe {{fossil record}} of the <b>Hippopotamidae</b> can shed light on three major issues in {{mammalian}} evolution. First, as the <b>Hippopotamidae</b> are the extant sister group of Cetacea, gaining {{a better understanding of}} the origin of the <b>Hippopotamidae</b> and of their Paleogene ancestors will be instrumental in clarifying phylogenetic relationships within Cetartiodactyla. Unfortunately, the data relevant to hippopotamid origins have generally been ignored in phylogenetic analyses of cetartiodactyls. In order to obtain better resolution, future analyses should consider hypotheses of hippopotamid Paleogene relationships. Notably, an emergence of the <b>Hippopotamidae</b> from within anthracotheriids has received growing support, leading to reconciliation between genetic and morphological evidence for the clade Cetancodonta (<b>Hippopotamidae</b> + Cetacea). Secondly, full account needs to be taken of the <b>Hippopotamidae</b> when studying the impact of environmental change on faunal evolution. This group of semi-aquatic large herbivores has a clear and distinct ecological role and a diverse and abundant fossil record, particularly in the African Neogene. We examine three major phases of hippopotamid evolution, namely the sudden appearance of hippopotamines in the late Miocene (the "Hippopotamine Event"), the subsequent rampant endemism in African basins, and the Pleistocene expansion of Hippopotamus. Each may have been influenced by multiple factors, including: late Miocene grass expansion, African hydrographical network disruption, and a unique set of adaptations that allowed Hippopotamus to respond efficiently to early Pleistocene environmental change. Thirdly, the fossil {{record of the}} <b>Hippopotamidae</b> documents the independent emergence of adaptive character complexes in relation to semiaquatic habits and in response to insular isolation. The semiaquatic specializations of fossil hippopotamids are particularly useful in interpreting the functional morphology and ecology of other, extinct groups of large semiaquatic herbivores. Hippopotamids can also serve as models to elucidate the evolutionary dynamics of island mammals...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe affinities of the <b>Hippopotamidae</b> are at {{the core}} of the {{phylogeny}} of Cetartiodactyla (even-toed mammals: cetaceans, ruminants, camels, suoids, and hippos). Molecular phylogenies support Cetacea as sister group of the <b>Hippopotamidae,</b> implying a long ghost lineage between the earliest cetaceans (approximately 53 Ma) and the earliest hippopotamids (approximately 16 Ma). Morphological studies have proposed two different sister taxa for hippopotamids: suoids (notably palaeochoerids) or anthracotheriids. Evaluating these phylogenetic hypotheses requires substantiating the poorly known early history of the <b>Hippopotamidae.</b> Here, we undertake an original morphological phylogenetic analysis including several "suiform" families and previously unexamined early Miocene taxa to test previous conflicting hypotheses. According to our results, Morotochoerus ugandensis and Kulutherium rusingensis, until now regarded as the sole African palaeochoerid and the sole African bunodont anthracotheriid, respectively, are unambiguously included within the <b>Hippopotamidae.</b> They are the earliest known hippopotamids and set the family fossil record back to the early Miocene (approximately 21 Ma). The analysis reveals that hippopotamids displayed an unsuspected taxonomic and body size diversity and remained restricted to Africa during most of their history, until the latest Miocene. Our results also confirm the deep nesting of <b>Hippopotamidae</b> within the paraphyletic Anthracotheriidae; this finding allows us to reconstruct the sequence of dental innovations that links advanced selenodont anthracotheriids to hippopotamids, previously a source of major disagreements on hippopotamid origins. The analysis demonstrates a close relationship between Eocene choeropotamids and anthracotheriids, a relationship that potentially fills the evolutionary gap between earliest hippopotamids and cetaceans implied by molecular analyses...|$|E
40|$|The {{origin of}} late Neogene <b>Hippopotamidae</b> (Artiodactyla) {{involves}} {{one of the}} most serious conflicts between comparative anatomy and molecular biology: is Artiodactyla paraphyletic? Molecular comparisons indicate that Cetacea should be the modern sister group of hippos. This finding implies the existence of a fossil lineage linking cetaceans (first known in the early Eocene) to hippos (first known in the middle Miocene). The relationships of hippos within Artiodactyla are challenging, and the immediate affinities of <b>Hippopotamidae</b> have been studied by biologists for almost two centuries without resolution. Here, we compare opposing hypotheses implicating several “suiform” families. This morphological analysis of a comprehensive set of taxa and characters offers a robust solution to the origins of <b>Hippopotamidae.</b> This family appears to be deeply nested within the otherwise extinct artiodactyl family Anthracotheriidae, most precisely within the most advanced selenodont forms. The proposed sister group of hippos is the middle to late Miocene African semiaquatic Libycosaurus. Any close relationships of hippos with suoids, particularly with Tayassuidae, are rejected. Furthermore, the clade (<b>Hippopotamidae,</b> Anthracotheriidae) is proposed as the sister group of the Cetacea, offering broad morphological support for a molecular phylogeny, such support being also consistent with the fossil record. Corroboration of this relationship requires an exploration of anthracothere affinities with other Paleogene artiodactyls. Among those, the position of Ruminantia is a central question, still to be solved. Further progress in this debate is likely to come from morphological studies of paleontological data, whether known or still to be discovered...|$|E

40|$|Artiodactyla (eved-toed ungulates) and Cetacea (whales) are two {{mammalian}} {{orders that}} are commonly recognised as sistergroups. Recently {{it has been}} suggested that Cetacea originated within Artiodactyla, but the relationships among the different artiodactyl lineages and Cetacea have not been conclusively established. In the present study the mitochondrial genome of the pig (Sus scrofa), the hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius), the alpaca (Lama pacos) and the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) have been analysed. These sequences have been used in phylogenetic analyses together with those of two baleen whales, two ruminants and several other eutherian mammals. The study is based on the concatenated nucleotide and amino acid sequences (10, 554 and 3, 518 characters respectively) of all the mitochondrial protein coding genes except NADH 6. Analyses on both data sets identified a basal divergence of the recent artiodactyls into Ruminantia (bovids, deers, tragulids and giraffs), Tylopoda (camels and llamas) and Suina (pigs and peccaries). However, the order in which these lineages diverged was not conclusively resolved. A clade of Ruminatia, <b>Hippopotamidae</b> (hippopotamuses) and Cetacea was identified where the sistergroup relationship between Cetacea and <b>Hippopotamidae</b> was well supported, making both Artiodactyla and Suiformes (pigs, peccaries and hippopotamuses) paraphyletic. Molecular data in conjunction with the palaeontological record have suggested that the primary divergence between recent whales into Odontoceti (toothed whales) and Mysticeti (baleen whales) occured 32 - 34 million years before present (MYBP). This calibration point suggests that the primary split between Ruminantia, Tylopoda and Suina occured at = 65 MYBP, the divergence between Ruminantia and Hippopotamidae/Cetacea at 60 MYBP and the divergence between <b>Hippopotamidae</b> and Cetacea at = 55 MYBP...|$|E
