50|$|In Drosophila, certain lateral neurons (LNs) {{have been}} shown to be {{important}} for circadian rhythms, including dorsal (LNd) and ventral (LNV) neurons. LNV neurons express PDF (pigment <b>dispersion</b> <b>factor),</b> which was initially hypothesized to be a clock output signal. Mutants for the pdf neuropeptide gene (pdf01) as well as flies selectively ablated for LNV produced similar behavioral responses. Both entrained to external light cues, but were largely arrhythmic in constant conditions. Some flies in each cases showed weak free-running rhythmicity. These results lead the researchers to believe that LNV neurons were the critical circadian pacemaker neurons and that PDF was the principal circadian transmitter.|$|E

This paper demonstrated the variance of atmosphere <b>dispersion</b> <b>factor</b> for accident release from nuclear power plant through running PAVAN (Atmospheric Dispersion of Radioactive Releases from Nuclear Power Plants) model.

The aims of this study were (1) to estimate the impact of different land use on organic carbon stock (OC-stock) and (2) to determine the clay percentage, the <b>dispersion</b> <b>factor,</b> and bulk density with regard to soil management. Thirty soil profiles were sampled as follows: four under primary forests with 80 - 100 years (old growth); two under secondary wood forests with 45 - 50 years; eight under secondary young forests with 15 - 25 years; four under pasture land with 15 - 20 years; and 12 under continuous cultivation for > 50 years. We determined the changes in OC-stock in the soils under different land-use conditions in relation to the primary forest variant. There was a difference in the OC-stock of the continuous cultivation variant compared to the remaining land-use variants for all soil-thickness layers. The greatest loss of cultivated soil was in the 0 - 20 cm layer of the primary forest OC-stock. In the 50 - 100 cm layer, the OC-stock of the cultivated soils diminished significantly.

The results show that all the environmental <b>dispersion</b> <b>factors</b> except humidity {{have an effect on}} the flammable vapor cloud distance. The more stable atmospheric condition, lower wind speed and smaller ground roughness lead to the longer flammable vapor cloud distance. The atmosphere temperature has a very limited influence on the flammable vapor cloud distance. The higher ambient temperature and larger humidity result in the longer downwind thermal radiation distance, while the atmospheric stability, wind speed and ground roughness nearly does not. All the four source release factors significantly influence the flammable vapor cloud distance and thermal radiation distance, which is due to the different release amount, release rate and initial momentum...|$|R
