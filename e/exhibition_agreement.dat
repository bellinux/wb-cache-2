40|$|The {{market for}} art and {{cultural}} property is international. Demand is intense and not particularly local {{in terms of}} consumer preference. 2 Supply responds to this intense international demand. Like most anything else, art finds its way to whomever is prepared to pay for it. Regulation affects how it arrives at its ultimate destination, but generally does not prevent it from getting there. Apart from this international market, legal and policy aspects of art and cultural property have a distinctly international flavor due to historical circumstance. Since many works over time {{have been removed from}} their source by way of conquest, expropriation, or theft, claims for cross-border restoration or restitution inevitably involve international law and policy considerations. Even a simple <b>exhibition</b> <b>agreement</b> at a foreign museum may generate complex issues of domestic and international private and public law...|$|E

The road was originally known as Albert's Road, but was officially changed to Queen's Gate in 1859.|$|R
50|$|There {{are still}} a small number who think that Korean {{might be related to}} the now discredited Altaic family, but {{linguists}} agree today that typological resemblances cannot be used to prove genetic relatedness of languages, as these features are typologically connected and easily borrowed from one language to the other. Such factors of typological divergence as Middle Mongolian's <b>exhibition</b> of gender <b>agreement</b> can be used to argue that a genetic relationship with Altaic is unlikely.|$|R

Affiliate status grants the institute access to the Smithsonian’s artifacts, education, and performing arts programs, expert speakers, teacher workshops, and resources to complement and broaden <b>exhibitions.</b> The Affiliation <b>agreement</b> marks a new era for the institute. A series of upgrades are planned to revitalize main exhibit floor. As UTSA strives to achieve national research university status, the University's museum strives to become a cultural institution of equal caliber.|$|R
50|$|Feature {{films and}} short subject {{projects}} completed and/or distributed by WWMPC are sold to exhibitors, television networks, television cable companies, and home entertainment outlets throughout the world. The company generates revenue {{from a variety}} of sources; the three basic media sources are: (1) theatrical <b>exhibition</b> (after <b>agreements</b> with the exhibitors have been made which provide for payment by the exhibitors of percentage of box office receipts with or without a guarantee of a fixed minimum); (2) licensing to television networks, regional broadcasters, and syndicated agreements (also after agreements which provide for a fixed license fee payable in periodic installments); and (3) wholesale of film/DVD product to various home entertainment outlets encompassing both foreign and domestic markets after an agreed upon fixed retail rental formula. Additional profits may also accumulate from ancillary exploitation of media product, including satellite broadcast, video on demand, and internet streaming/download; screenings on airlines, cruise ships, university circuits, and military bases; and literary rights, merchandising, and related paraphernalia.|$|R
5000|$|On January 27, 2012, the BOG and CNEA {{announced}} that the CNEA will officially become financially independent from both the Board of Governors of Exhibition Place and the City of Toronto in 2013. [...] "Chair of the Board BOG, City Councillor Mark Grimes stated, 'The independence of the CNEA is good for both the CNEA and <b>Exhibition</b> Place. The <b>agreement</b> will protect the Board of Governors and the City against any negative financial consequences {{and at the same}} time allow the CNEA to reach financial and organizational stability for the new independent organization.'" [...] "It will be beneficial for the CNEA to be independent from the City of Toronto to be able to determine and implement consumer strategies and fiscal decisions that are made in the interest of the CNEA and its visitors, as experts within the fair business." [...] As an independent organization, the CNEA will be able to retain its profits and re-invest in the fair. [...] "'This is an extraordinary opportunity for the Canadian National Exhibition,' stated Brian Ashton, President of the Canadian National Exhibition Association (CNEA). 'We believe that as an independent business we can flourish and present an annual fair that will make Toronto and Canada proud!'" [...] "Toronto City Council will be asked for approval of this new agreement at their March 5-6, 2012 meeting." ...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a parsimonious model for forecasting the gross box-office revenues of new motion pictures based on early box office data. The paper also seeks to provide insights into the impact of distribution policies on the adoption of new products. The model is intended to assist motion picture exhibitor chains (retailers) in managing their exhibition capacity and in negotiating <b>exhibition</b> license <b>agreements</b> with distributors (studios), by allowing them to project the box-office potential of the movies they plan to or currently exhibit based on early box-office results. It is also of interest to practitioners in other software industries (e. g., music, books, CD-ROMs) where the distribution intensity is highly variable over the product life cycle and is an important determinant of new product adoption patterns. The model and its extensions are of interest to academic researchers interested in modeling distribution effects in new product adoption, as well as forecasters looking for ways to leverage historical data on related products to forecast the sales of new products. We draw upon a queuing theory framework to conceptualize stochastically the consumer's movie adoption process in two steps—the to see the new movie, and the on the adoption decision. The parameter for the time-to-decide process captures the intensity of information intensity flowing from various information sources, while the parameter for the time-to-act process is related to the delay created by limited distribution intensity and other factors. Our conceptualization extends existing new product forecasting models, which assume that consumers act instantaneously on the motivating information they receive about the new product. The resulting model is parsimonious, yet it accommodates a wide range of adoption patterns. In addition, the stochastic formulation allows us to quantify the uncertainty surrounding the expected adoption pattern. In the empirical testing, we focus on the most parsimonious version of the modeling framework. BOXMOD-I, a model that assumes stationarity with respect to the two shape parameters that characterize the adoption process. The model produces fairly accurate early forecasts using at most the first three weeks of data for calibration, and the predictive performance of the model compares favorably with benchmark models. We propose extensions of the basic model that account for more realistic non-stationary distribution intensity patterns—including a “wide release” pattern that relies on intensive distribution and promotion, and a “platform release” pattern that involves a gradual buildup of distribution intensity. Finally, we present an adaptive weighing scheme that combines initial parameter estimates obtained from a meta-analysis procedure with estimates obtained from early data to produce forecasts of box-office revenues for a new movie when little or no box-office data are available. An important finding from the empirical testing is that motion picture box-office revenue patterns display remarkable empirical regularity. We find that there are only three classes of adoption patterns, and these can all be represented within the basic model by using a two-parameter. Exponential or Erlang- 2 probability distribution, or a three parameter Generalized Gamma distribution. We also find that cumulative box-office revenues can be predicted with reasonable accuracy (often within 10 % of the actual) using as little as two or three data points. However, our attempts to predict revenue patterns without any sales data meet with limited success. While the scale parameter can be estimated reasonably well from a historical database of parameter values, we find that it is considerably more difficult to predict the shape parameters using historical data. The parsimony we seek in developing the model comes at the cost of several limiting assumptions. We assume that the time-to-decide subprocess and the time-to-act subprocess are independent, which may not be the case if decisions on continued exhibition by retailers are endogenously related to box-office revenues over the life cycle. In the basic model formulation, we also assume that the time-to-act process can be represented by an exponential distribution, which may not always be the case. While we provide some empirical evidence to support these assumptions, further research could relax these and other assumptions to enrich the basic model, although this would entail some loss in parsimony. forecasting, motion pictures, distribution, stochastic models, consumer behavior...|$|R
