[...] His desire to share with his own generation as well as future ones seems to have been the impetus for meticulously filming these lectures, which otherwise could not have been broadcast on television or sold on videocassette. Bernstein was, however, not alone in the arrangements to promote his career and legacy through these lectures. In 1971, Harry Kraut began working for Bernstein, taking responsibility for much of the business side accompanying Bernstein’s career. [...] Kraut organized a <b>dissemination</b> <b>strategy</b> that included all possible formats: the published lecture transcripts, the television airing, and the videocassettes. This strategy required extensive planning because the lectures were recorded off-site, at WGBH, immediately following the lecture at Harvard Square Theater. Most of the orchestral examples were recorded in advance, in December 1972, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Bernstein provided much of the funding for this elaborate project himself.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to explore renewable energy as means to stimulating envi-ronmental transformation in the electricity sector, where photovoltaics (PV) are chosen as the specific subject. The first generation of PV-technology has reached a phase of market introduction, but is not yet cost-effective, which in general is considered as the main current obstacle for this technology. The purpose of this report is to explore, how <b>dissemination</b> <b>strategies</b> {{can be used as}} means to enhance the demand of the PV-technology and thereby achieve the necessary level of demand. The long-term aim is stimulating a positive market development towards the emergence of a self-sustaining and full-fledged PV-industry. <b>Dissemination</b> <b>strategies</b> are of special interest in this re-gard, as private households become new important players within the energy sector, which is traditionally regulated by governmental bodies. The physical and technical de-vice of the PV-technology enables costumers with a limited electricity consumption as well as economic affordability to become independent PV power producers and thus provide entirely new dissemination possibilities. The investigation of this subject is con-ducted as an evaluation of the most important past and current <b>dissemination</b> <b>strategies.</b> The analysis is carried out as a systematic assessment of the relations between a) imple-mentation of a specific strategy, b) demand enhancement and c) to which extend price reduction is achieved. In this methodology both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the deployment process are stressed. The main conclusions of the report are, that dis-semination strategies contain a wide variety of different instruments and possibilities of motivating a broad range of costumers. In general <b>dissemination</b> <b>strategies</b> are effective instruments as means to enhance demand. The use of financial incentives though in-volves a risk of damaging the industry, which is important taking into account...|$|R

This model {{takes into account the}} infected remov-able storage media and hence captures the interaction of patches with viruses better than the original SIPS model. Surprisingly, the proposed model exhibits much simpler dynamic properties than the original SIPS model. Specifically, our model admits only two potential (viral) equilibria and undergoes a fold bifurcation. The global stabilities of the two equilibria are determined. Consequently, the dynamical properties of the proposed model are fully understood. Furthermore, it is found that reducing the probability per unit time of disconnect-ing a node from the Internet benefits the containment of electronic viruses. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective The {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} what strategies have been evaluated to disseminate cancer control interventions that promote the uptake of adult healthy diet? Methods A systematic review was conducted. Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, Cancer LIT, EMBASE/Excerpta Medica, PsycINFO, CINAHL, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and reference lists and by contacting technical experts. English-language primary studies were selected if they evaluated the dissemination of healthy diet interventions in individuals, healthcare providers, or institutions. Studies of children or adolescents only were excluded. Results One hundred one articles were retrieved for full text screening. Nine reports of seven distinct studies were included; four were randomized trials, one was a cohort design and three were descriptive studies. Six studies were rated as methodologically weak, and one was rated as moderate. Studies were not meta-analyzed because of heterogeneity, low methodological quality, and incomplete data reporting. No beneficial <b>dissemination</b> <b>strategies</b> were found except one that looks promising, the use of peer educators in the worksite, {{which led to a}} short-term increase in fruit and vegetable intake. Conclusions and Implications Overall, the quality of the evidence is not strong and is primarily descriptive rather than evaluative. No clear conclusions can be drawn from these data. Controlled studies are needed to evaluate <b>dissemination</b> <b>strategies,</b> and to compare <b>dissemination</b> and diffusion <b>strategies</b> with different messages and different target audiences. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} is Part Three of a 3 -part series by the National Centre for Education and Training on Addiction (NCETA) examining effectiveness, costs and theories related to dissemination {{and implementation of}} research into practice. Part One in the series is a systematic review that evaluated the effectiveness of 16 different <b>dissemination</b> <b>strategies</b> for implementing new research, programs and treatments into practice in alcohol- and other drug-related areas (Bywood, Lunnay & Roche, 2008 a). Part Two is {{an examination of the}} costs associated with using such strategies (Bywood, Lunnay & Roche, 2008 b). In this part (Part Three), the theories and models of change underpinning the use of <b>dissemination</b> <b>strategies</b> and the implications for the alcohol and other drugs (AOD) field are examined. This report provides a summary of key theories and models that have been used in the development of <b>dissemination</b> <b>strategies</b> for facilitating uptake of innovations into practice, or to interpret the outcomes of an evaluation of such strategies. Studies that were included in Part One were examined for any reference to theories, theoretical frameworks or models of behavioural and organisational change. A description of the identified theories and models of change is outlined and findings from relevant studies are summarised in the current report. Finally, some common elements across the different theories were identified, and the key dissemination theories and models are discussed in terms of their relevance for getting effective innovations implemented in the AOD. Theories are classified into five broad types: • Learning theories • Motivational theories • Stage models • Process or planning models • Ecological or organisational change theories. Theories and models, which focus on either the individual practitioner and/or the organisation as the unit of change, may address change at different levels, including: • Intrapersonal: Theories or models that attempt to explain or predict change in an individual’s attitudes, knowledge, behaviour or intentions to act • Interpersonal: Theories or models that attempt to explain or predict change in the way individuals act in the context or their social environment • Ecological / Organisational: Theories or models that attempt to explain or predict change {{at the level of the}} organisation or wider social system. No single theory or model accounted for all possible variables that might contribute to behaviour change and not all theories were useful in all circumstances. Thus, the use of multiple theories to change complex human behaviours may be needed. However, there were several theoretical elements that were common to multiple theories and may contribute to a change in practice. These common elements were: •	Perceived control over behaviour (self-efficacy) •	Perceived outcomes of behaviour (expectancy) •	Motivation Intention to act •	Positive attitude •	Personal values •	Affect •	Role of social influences (perceived norms) •	Environmental barriers •	Professional development (training) One example of a framework for developing <b>dissemination</b> and implementation <b>strategies</b> is described. This framework identified and integrated theoretical constructs that are relevant to changing professional practice across multiple levels. The six key elements were: 1. Identify the problem or need to change 2. Examine the current context 3. Consider the relevant theoretical constructs 4. Develop a strategy 5. Implement change 6. Evaluate the process, seek feedback and maintain change. Incorporating these elements into <b>dissemination</b> <b>strategies</b> may increase the potential for effective implementation of innovations into practice or for interpreting findings and refining strategies for specific situations, populations or target behaviours. Thus limited resources can be allocated to effective <b>dissemination</b> <b>strategies</b> with a higher probability of success...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Data <b>dissemination</b> <b>strategies</b> and {{communication}} protocols that minimize {{the use of}} energy can significantly prolong the lifetime of a sensor network. Data-centric <b>dissemination</b> <b>strategies</b> seek energy efficiency by employing short metadata descriptions in advertisements (ADVs) {{of the availability of}} data, short requests (REQs) to obtain the data by nodes that are interested in it, and data transmissions (DATA) to deliver data to the requesting nodes. An important decision in this process is whether the DATA transmission should be made at full power in broadcast mode or at low power in multi-hop unicast mode. The determining factor is shown in this paper to be the fraction of nodes that are interested in the DATA, as shown by the number of REQs that are generated. Closed form expressions for this critical fraction of interested nodes is derived when the nodes have no memory or infinite memory for state information and when transmissions are reliable and not reliable. These results can be used during both the design and operation of the network to increase energy efficiency and network longevity.

30|$|For the {{roadside}} infrastructures, energy conservation {{in the data}} <b>dissemination</b> <b>strategy</b> guarantees the efficient usage of energy, which makes great contribution to the commercial application of VCPS. Recently, many researches {{have been made to}} improve energy efficiency. In [17], by using a mixed-integer linear programming optimization method, the author proposes a data <b>dissemination</b> <b>strategy</b> with the ability of satisfying the communication requirements while minimizing the energy consumption. In the highway scenario, the location of vehicles passing through {{the roadside}} infrastructure radio coverage area can be predicted {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. Hammad et al. [18] use this information to reduce the energy cost of the downlink infrastructure-to-vehicle data dissemination. In [19], to obtain a energy-efficient data <b>dissemination</b> <b>strategy,</b> authors classify the energy efficiency problem into three categories and formulate them as a three-step optimization problem. In [20] and [21], two different on/off sleep data dissemination strategies are proposed. In these strategies, if there is no request received from vehicles, the roadside infrastructure works alternately between ON and OFF in a periodical manner to reduce the energy consumption. In [22], a variable bit rate transmission is used to increase the energy efficiency and the roadside infrastructures adapt its bit rate to accommodate different channel path loss conditions. However, all the above studies are still based on the periodically beaconing strategy. The problem of how to optimize the beaconing interval to reduce the energy consumption is still a whitespace in these papers.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundCancer {{and other}} chronic {{diseases}} reduce quality {{and length of}} life and productivity, and represent a significant financial burden to society. Evidence-based public health approaches to prevent cancer and other chronic diseases {{have been identified in}} recent decades and have the potential for high impact. Yet, barriers to implement prevention approaches persist as a result of multiple factors including lack of organizational support, limited resources, competing emerging priorities and crises, and limited skill among the public health workforce. The {{purpose of this study is}} to learn how best to promote the adoption of evidence based public health practice related to chronic disease prevention. Methods/designThis paper describes the methods for a multi-phase dissemination study with a cluster randomized trial component that will evaluate the dissemination of public health knowledge about evidence-based prevention of cancer and other chronic diseases. Phase one involves development of measures of practitioner views on and organizational supports for evidence-based public health and data collection using a national online survey involving state health department chronic disease practitioners. In phase two, a cluster randomized trial design will be conducted to test receptivity and usefulness of <b>dissemination</b> <b>strategies</b> directed toward state health department chronic disease practitioners to enhance capacity and organizational support for evidence-based chronic disease prevention. Twelve state health department chronic disease units will be randomly selected and assigned to intervention or control. State health department staff and the university-based study team will jointly identify, refine, and select <b>dissemination</b> <b>strategies</b> within intervention units. Intervention (<b>dissemination)</b> <b>strategies</b> may include multi-day in-person training workshops, electronic information exchange modalities, and remote technical assistance. Evaluation methods include pre-post surveys, structured qualitative phone interviews, and abstraction of state-level chronic disease prevention program plans and progress reports.
