40|$|Steering and {{suspension}} {{systems are}} components that supply driving safety in vehicles. For a correct working {{the mechanisms of}} these systems consist of many ball-joints that have different functions. Generally the ball-joints are assembled to systems in press-fit without any gaps, but even with residual forces. On the other hand excessive tightness causes high moments, which requires additional processes of manufacturing. But low tightness also creates gaps in joints. None of these conditions are desired. Manufacturing a ball-race that has long-life, low-friction and provides required working angles in every road condition, can be designed after long test processes and sample productions including lots of improvements. An important element of steering systems in vehicles is suspension ball-race that can be manufactured by assembling with plastic deformation after designing the ball-joint. In this study, during the manufacturing of the suspension ball-race supplying the motion transmission, the edge-form rolling process that is a subsection of rolling process of manufacturing methods based on plastic deformation was examined.

Rolling track surfaces were examined by optical microscopy, SEM, 3 -D surface analysis, atomic force microscopy and interference profilometry. Experimental results show that with a initial roughness value Ra from 0. 016 to 0. 094 µm, the surfaces became smoother during testing and surface pitting (10 ~ 20 µm) occurred. For the surfaces with a roughness value Ra from 0. 002 to 0. 008 µm, the surfaces became rougher and lubricant oil residues were deposited at the <b>edges</b> of <b>rolling</b> track. Some small and shallow surface pitting 2 ~ 3 µm in size was also observed. Some scratch marks left on the surface by the previous lapping process were further extended during testing.

40|$|Many metals tend {{to develop}} edge cracks during {{hot and cold}} <b>rolling.</b> <b>Edge</b> cracks need to be removed by a {{trimming}} operation, and they may cause rupture of the sheet in the rolling mill.

In conjunction with a plausible failure criterion the Gologanu-Leblond model, which is based on non-spherical ductile void growth, is able to predict edge cracking and the characteristic zigzag damage pattern {{on the edge of the}} rolled sheet. The experimental determination of the model parameters remains a challenging task, since the stress and strain history at the edge of a rolled sheet is substantially different from the situation in a tensile test, and also from that in other conventional laboratory tests...|$|R

The hydraulic press was invented by Joseph Bramah in 1795; the expression outlet of his press was based on the traditional oil mill method with filter cloths. At the end of the 19 th century German companies produced hydraulic cage presses, with rams pressing the seeds inside of vertical slotted barrels that did not require filter cloths [29]. The hydraulic press developed during Carlyle’s MolArt-fellowship, is based on these clothless models but works horizontally instead of vertically.|$|R

A matrix for analyzing the rolling process of a Sendzimir mill has been established as well as a software SM 4 SM (Setup Models for Sendzimir Mill) by which the strip <b>edge</b> drop during <b>rolling</b> has been studied using the CEM. The calculated results show that the strip edge drop will decrease when increasing the 1 st intermediate roll (IMR) taper slope and length, reducing the 1 st IMR shifting, increasing the roll J and the work roll crown, or increasing the tension stress; by contraries, the strip edge drop will increase.

50|$|Researchers have {{hypothesized}} that the ability of leukocytes to maintain attachment and rolling on the blood vessel wall {{can be explained by}} a combination of many factors, including cell flattening to maintain a larger binding surface-area and reduce hydrodynamic drag, as well as tethers holding the rear of the rolling cell to the endothelium breaking and slinging {{to the front of the}} rolling cell to reattach to the endothelial wall. These hypotheses work well with Marshall’s 2003 findings that selectin bonds go through a catch-slip transition in which initial increases in shear force strengthen the bond, but with enough applied force bond lifetimes begin to decay exponentially. Therefore, the weak binding of a sling at the leading <b>edge</b> of a <b>rolling</b> leukocyte would initially be strengthened as the cell rolls farther and the tension on the bond increases, preventing the cell from dissociating from the endothelial wall and floating freely in the bloodstream despite high shear forces. However, at the trailing edge of the cell, tension becomes high enough to transition the bond from catch to slip, and the bonds tethering the trailing edge eventually break, allowing the cell to roll further instead of remaining stationary.|$|R
