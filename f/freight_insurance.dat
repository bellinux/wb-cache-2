40|$|This study aims to {{establish}} the development of foreign trade in the Muscovite lands, the Baltic provinces and in the areas which were newly settled in the mid eighteenth century with particular reference {{to the role of}} British merchants in these changes. This has required an analysis of the structure of trade through the 'Russian' Baltic and White Sea ports and an investigation of the changing patterns of commercial acitivity caused by fluctuations in the boundaries of their supply areas and of internal and external markets for the goods they handled. Detailed consideration has been given to the commodities handled in the import, export and re-export trades utilising data from the Sound Toll accounts together with British and Russian customs statistics. Having established a wide framework for the investigation of Russian foreign trade, detailed consideration has been given {{to the role of the}} British commercial community. In order to do so it has been necessary to reconstruct the methods used by British merchants in Russia in organising their commercial activities: this includes examining the structure of the British mercantile 'houses' in all the Russian ports, but especially in St. Petersburg; the patterns of recruitment of young men into the trade and their style of life in Russia; the network of contacts which they established among their compatriots, whether involved in commerce or other professions, with other foreign merchants and also with their aristocratic clients and their Russian counterparts involved in internal trade. Merchants in the Russia trade faced changing costs to their business for <b>freight,</b> <b>insurance</b> and customs duties and the fluctuations in these charges and their responses to them have been assessed. One of the most important aspects of their activities was the way in which they financed their trade. Decision-making in this matter was influenced by events throughout Europe as well as in Russia, for account had to be taken of the relative value in silver of the commodities which the Russia merchant handled in that country and elsewhere. Thus, during the late seventeenth century, they paid for Russian goods in specie whilst increasingly in the eighteenth century it made better economic sense to deal in imported commodities as far as the market allowed and finance the balance with trade surpluses accumulated elsewhere, thereby causing the emergence of a close co-operation between the British and Dutch communities in Russia in financing their trade, with the Dutch lending the proceeds of their import surplus to the British in return for bills of exchange on Amsterdam. The costs arising from the movement of the rate of exchange and interest rates within the financial network so formed, have been fully inves¬ tigated and their effect on the trade explored. The effects of these changes on Russia's overseas trade and the internal impact of the development of this external commercial sector to the Russian economy receives especial consideration with particular emphasis being placed on the response of the aristocracy in both their changing patterns of consumption of imported goods and in the development of their estates to provide raw materials for export or supplying Russian merchant and serf manufacturers who were at this time responding to growing overseas markets for their products...|$|E

40|$|In {{establishing}} {{the value of}} imports for tariff assessment, most countries apply duties either to the cost-insurance-freight (c. i. f.) or the free-on-board (f. o. b.) value of the traded good. One effect of using the far more common c. i. f. base is to place a disproportinate burden on countries that have higher <b>freight</b> and <b>insurance</b> costs. Distant countries often not only pay higher transport costs, but are further penalized by disproportionate tariff costs that worsen their competitive disadvantage. The f. o. b. valuation procedure does not penalize exporters for their location, but applies a nominal tariff rate directly to the export costs of each country. Using cost information for six Latin American countries, this paper examines {{the influence of the}} two procedures on the level and incidence of tariff protection. It concludes that transport and insurance costs generally put developing countries at a disadvantage (compared to developed countries) on interregional trade and that the relatively high Latin American tariffs on c. i. f. prices further worsen their competitive position. To correct the bias against trade between developing countries, it is recommended that f. o. b. valuation procedures used by developed countries be adopted. This change would also reduce tariff barriers considerably.

40|$|Financing is {{more likely}} to be {{required}} in international trade than in purely domestic transactions. Part of the reason is that the time elapsing between production and payment is likely to be far greater, because of the longer distances involved in shipping goods and in moving payments through financial channels. That, in turn, is related to the increased complexity and extensive documentation typical of international trade. Payment may take a lot longer, because there is a greater possibility of error and delay. The costs of sales are higher in international trade than in domestic trade. There are packing and labelling costs, shipping costs, the costs of hiring <b>freight</b> forwarders, <b>insurance</b> costs, customs remittances, and payments to various agents, distributors and other intermediaries. All of these add up. And many of those providing such services expect payment within 30 to 120 days, whether or not the shipment has reached its destination or has been accepted at the other end. In large international transactions the costs add up quickly, and they can be covered in the short-term only through some form of financing. A separate expenditure in international trade is the cost of protecting a company against specific risks, such as default in payment by a buyer or a sudden unfavourable fluctuation in exchange rates. Establishing credit ratings for foreign companies is often both difficult and costly; so is taking out insurance against payments in default. Hedging against exchange rate fluctuations also costs money, and this is usually payable up front. The purpose of this study is to lead inexperienced companies to prepare for a financially strong export performance by making them familiar with both classical and new financial techniques...|$|R

Due to data availability, 15 monthly data from January 1995 to December 2005 (132 observations) are used to test transmission effects before the full implementation of the CAP Luxembourg agreement, while bi-weekly data from January 2006 to December 2015 (260 observations) are used to test for transmission post implementation of the agreement. For butter, a representative EU and a World price series are considered. The EU prices are weekly Dutch Dairy Board wholesale prices, as published by Agra Europe. They have been converted to monthly and bi-weekly data by simply averaging weekly prices. The World butter prices are reported by the USDA. 16 These consist of FOB (Free on Board) wholesale Oceania export prices which can be considered as proxy World prices. 17 Crude oil prices are Europe Brent FOB prices and were obtained from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). 18 Lastly, two sources for palm oil prices are considered.

The results indicated that the domestic, CIF (Cost. <b>Insurance,</b> <b>Freight)</b> and FOB (Free Oil Board) prices were cointegrated, implying that changes in the import and export prices are transmitted to the domestic market affecting the milk price paid to producers. Prior to 200 1, the import price (CIF) was the relevant reference dictating the movements of the domestic price. After 2001, the export price (FOB) became the reference, whereas the CIF price was no longer significant. the parameters of the VEC model SLIcroest that the conitegrating relation between CIF and domestic prices for the first period Under analysis (1990 - 2000) was clearer than that between FOB and domestic prices for the second period (2001 - 2007 / 3). the price elasticity for the FOB-domestic price vector had a large confidence interval, which is Why it IS difficult to draw strong conclusions regarding the impact Of future FOB fluctuations Oil the milk price paid to producers in Chile after 2001...|$|R
40|$|The historiography of {{economic}} relationships between Britain and the Southern Cone {{during the first}} half of the nineteenth century largely ignores trade. Yet, neither British direct, nor portfolio, investment was important during this period, when the main gains arose from trade, and directly associated invisible earnings: credits, shipping <b>freights</b> and <b>insurance.</b> British exports have long been taken for granted to the extent that there are no specific considerations of textile exports to Latin America. Between 1815 and 1859, textiles comprised over 80 per cent of British exports to the Southern Cone. This thesis considers in detail the process by which textiles were transferred from British manufacturers to local wholesalers. The various relationships between manufacturers, merchants, ship-brokers, underwriters and mercantile houses are assessed and analysed. New light is thrown on the relative roles of the consignment system and own account operations, advances against consignments, marine insurances, return remittances, commissions and fees, shipping strategies, packing, and on the use and management of samples and pattern books. Along with a lack of awareness of how British textiles were exported, little was known about the actual growth of Britain’s exports to this region. The picture painted by the historiography, which lacked robust data, was that early exports glutted the markets. It has been maintained that, thereafter, the small, low-income and scattered rural population of the Southern Cone had little to offer in exchange. Furthermore, it has also been put forward that high internal transport costs made this former backwater of the Spanish Empire nothing but a marginal market. This view considers the Southern Cone solely ‘responsible’ for the supposedly low volume of British exports. Post- 1860 s developments – railways and European migration on a sizeable scale – are regarded as being responsible for the growth of exports. This simplistic yet well-rooted approach is challenged. There was nothing exceptional in the development of the value of British exports to this market. When measured by volume, textiles exported by Britain to the Southern Cone expanded continuously throughout the 1820 s, 1830 s and 1840 s and at very high rates, in particular, if per capita consumption is considered. Apart from the factors considered in the historiography, an explanation of the Southern Cone’s increasing absorption of British manufactures from the 1820 s requires an examination of other local conditions as well as the changing situation in Britain, namely: improvements in packing of textiles; falling costs of productions in Britain; falling ocean freight rates; falling marine insurances; introduction of free trade in Britain; dramatic improvements in communications; falling import duties on the spot; better port facilities; struggle of local craft industries; and the establishment of a more stable political system on the spot...|$|R
60|$|This implies (if we exclude for {{the present}} any other {{international}} payments than those occurring {{in the course of}} commerce) that the exports and imports exactly pay for one another, or, in other words, that the equation of international demand is established. When such is the fact, the international transactions are liquidated without the passage of any money from one country to the other. But, if there is a greater sum due from the United States to England than is due from England to the United States, or vice versa, the debts can not be simply written off against one another. After the one has been applied, as far as it will go, toward covering the other, the balance must be transmitted in the precious metals. In point of fact, the merchant who has the amount to pay will even then pay for it by a bill. When a person has a remittance to make to a foreign country, he does not himself search for some one who has money to receive from that country, and ask him for a bill of exchange. In this, as in other branches of business, there is a class of middle-men or brokers, who bring buyers and sellers together, or stand between them, buying bills from those who have money to receive, and selling bills to those who have money to pay. When a customer comes to a broker for a bill on Paris or Amsterdam, the broker sells to him perhaps the bill he may himself have bought that morning from a merchant, perhaps a bill on his own correspondent in the foreign city; and, to enable his correspondent to pay, when due, all the bills he has granted, he remits to him all those which he has bought and has not resold. In this manner these brokers take upon themselves the whole settlement of the pecuniary transactions between distant places, being remunerated by a small commission or percentage on the amount of each bill which they either sell or buy. Now, if the brokers find that they are asked for bills, on the one part, to a greater amount than bills are offered to them on the other, they do not on this account refuse to give them; but since, in that case, they have no means of enabling the correspondents on whom their bills are drawn to pay them when due, except by transmitting part of the amount in gold or silver, they require from those to whom they sell bills an additional price, sufficient to cover the <b>freight</b> and <b>insurance</b> of the gold and silver, with a profit sufficient to compensate them for their trouble and for the temporary occupation of a portion of their capital. This premium (as it is called) the buyers are willing to pay, because they must otherwise go to the expense of remitting the precious metals themselves, and it is done cheaper by those who make doing it a part of their especial business. But, though only some of those who have a debt to pay would have actually to remit money, all will be obliged, by each other’s competition, to pay the premium; and the brokers are for the same reason obliged to pay it to those whose bills they buy. The reverse of all this happens, if, on the comparison of exports and imports, the country, instead of having a balance to pay, has a balance to receive. The brokers find more bills offered to them than are sufficient to cover those which they are required to grant. Bills on foreign countries consequently fall to a discount; and the competition among the brokers, which is exceedingly active, prevents them from retaining this discount as a profit for themselves, and obliges them to give the benefit of it to those who buy the bills for purposes of remittance.|$|R

After completing two years MBA program, I was sent out to have practical knowledge in business life as a part of my academic program. In this report I had tried to focus my both theoretical and practical knowledge regarding freight practices. My internship topic is ‘Freight Forwarding business of UTi Pership”. Freight Forwarder is a firm specializing in arranging storage and shipping of merchandise on behalf of its shippers. It usually provides a full range of services including: tracking inland transportation, preparation of shipping and export documents, warehousing, booking cargo space, negotiating freight charges, <b>freight</b> consolidation, cargo <b>insurance,</b> and filing of <b>insurance</b> claims. <b>Freight</b> forwarders usually ship under their own bills of lading or air waybills (called house bill of lading or house air waybill) and their agents or associates at the destination (overseas freight forwarders) provide document delivery, deconsolidation, and freight collection services. The International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations (FIATA) shorthand description of the freight forwarder as the 'Architect of Transport' illustrates the commercial position of the forwarder relative to its client. Freight forwarding services negotiate the best possible price to move the product along the most economical route by working out various bids and choosing the one that best balances speed, cost and reliability. Freight forwarding service then undertakes the responsibility of arranging the transport from point of origin to destination. The history of Freight Forwarding is not too old. One of the earliest freight forwarders was Thomas Meadows and Company Limited of London, England, established in 1836. According to "Understanding the Freight Business," written and published by the executive staff of Thomas Meadows and Company in 1972, the advent of reliable rail transport and steamships created demand for the fledgling freight forwarding industry. Trade developed between Europe and North America, creating additional demand. The first international freight forwarders were innkeepers in London who held and re-forwarded the personal effects of their hotel guests. Forwarder responsibilities include advice on documentation and customs requirements in the country of destination. And the correspondent agent in overseas look after customers' goods and keep informed about matters that would affect movement of goods. In a single transaction, the forwarder may be acting as a carrier (principal) or as an agent for his customer or both. Mohammed Mehedi HasanM. Business Administratio...|$|R
