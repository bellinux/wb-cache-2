40|$|Abstract: This is a {{study on}} the removal of copper (II) ions from a feed {{solution}} using an <b>emulsified</b> <b>liquid</b> membrane (ELM). The membrane was prepared by dissolving the extractant Alamine, used as a mobile carrier, and Span- 80, a surfactant, in kerosene. The ELM allowed an efficient metal transport from the feed solution towards the strip liquor, in experiments carried out in a batch-type stirred tank at 30 0 C. The experimental results indicated that the significant variables on copper transport through the membrane were the extractant concentration, the surfactant concentration, initial copper concentration and the pH of the feed, strip solution. Concentration of H 2 SO 4 as stripping agent affected only the initial metal extraction rate but not the extraction extent. The surfactant concentration range employed in this study adequately stabilized the membrane. However, it did not produce any positive effect on metal extraction. It was observed that the use of an excessively high content of surfactant produced lower metal transport extraction since it gave rise to a higher interfacial resistance.

40|$|In this research, {{the burning}} {{efficiency}} {{as well as}} exhaust emission of a new water-in-oil emulsified fuel system was studied. This emulsified system contains two core processes, {{the first one is}} to mix 97 % water with 3 % emulsifier by volume, and get the milk-like <b>emulsified</b> <b>liquid,</b> while the second one is to compound the milk-like <b>emulsified</b> <b>liquid</b> with heavy oil then obtain the emulsified fuel.

From the results of a series burning tests, the fuel saving can be over 8 ~ 15 %. Also, from the comparison of decline for the heat value and total energy output of varies emulsified fuel, one can find that the water as the dispersed phase in the combustion process will leading a micro-explosion as well as the water gas effect, both can raise the combustion temperature and burning efficiency. By comparing the waste gas emission of different types of emulsified fuel, one can know that, the CO 2 emission reduces approximately 14 %, and NOx emission reduces above 46 %, that means the reduction of the exhaust gas is truly effectively. From the exhaust temperature of tail pipe, the waste heat discharge also may reduce 27 %, it is quite advantageous to the global warming as well as earth environmental protection...|$|R

Trying to include these effects presents other difficulties. Constructing smaller, scaled-down water models introduce further differences. These differences are investigated using computational models of both the water models and real casters. The Froude similarity criterion reasonably reproduces overall flow features for different scale models, so long as the flow regime stays fully turbulent. Flow in small scale water models behaves differently, if the flow regime becomes laminar. Neglecting the surface slag layer causes excessive surface velocities in a water model. Neglecting the solidifying shell causes unrealistic lower surface velocities and surface waves in the water model, especially for thinner cross sections. Thus, water models of thin slab casters may become unreliable...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{effectiveness}} of inhaled aerosolized antibiotics {{is limited by}} poor ventilation of infected airways. Pulmonary delivery of antibiotics <b>emulsified</b> within <b>liquid</b> perfluorocarbon [antibacterial perfluorocarbon ventilation (APV) ] may solve this problem through better airway penetration and improved spatial uniformity. However, little {{work has been done}} to explore emulsion formulation and the corresponding effects on drug delivery during APV. This study investigated the effects of emulsion formulation on emulsion stability and the pharmacokinetics of antibiotic delivery via APV. Methods: Gravity-driven phase separation was examined in vitro by measuring emulsion tobramycin concentrations at varying heights within a column of emulsion over 4 hours for varying values of fluorosurfactant concentration (Cfs?=? 5 ? 48 ?mg/mL H 2 O). Serum and pulmonary tobramycin concentrations in rats were then evaluated following pulmonary tobramycin delivery via aerosol or APV utilizing sufficiently stable emulsions of varying aqueous volume percentage (Vaq?=? 1 %? 5 %), aqueous tobramycin concentration (Ct?=? 20 ? 100 ?mg/mL), and Cfs (15 and 48 ?mg/mL H 2 O). Results: In vitro assessment showed sufficient spatial and temporal uniformity of tobramycin dispersion within emulsion for Cfs?â¥ 15 ?mg/mL H 2 O, while lower Cfs values showed insufficient emulsification even immediately following preparation. APV with stable emulsion formulations resulted in 5 ? 22 times greater pulmonary tobramycin concentrations at 4 hours post-delivery relative to aerosolized delivery. Concentrations increased with emulsion formulations utilizing increased Vaq (with decreased Ct) and, to a lesser extent, increased Cfs. Conclusions: The emulsion stability necessary for effective delivery is retained at Cfs values as low as 15 ?mg/mL H 2 O. Additionally, the pulmonary retention of antibiotic delivered via APV is significantly greater than that of aerosolized delivery and can be most effectively increased by increasing Vaq and decreasing Ct. APV has been further proven as an effective means of pulmonary drug delivery with the potential to significantly improve antibiotic therapy for lung disease patients...|$|R
