Method of {{analysis for the}} beam on elastic founda-tion was extended to the time dependent problem and numerical method based on the finite difference method was used. As the results of numerical calculations, it was clarified that while DCB specimen bonded with epoxy adhesives containing 0 and 20 phr of <b>flexibilizer</b> did not show the nonlinearity on load-deflection curve, those with 40 and 60 phr of <b>flexibilizer</b> showed the slight nonlinearity. Strain energy release rate of the DCB specimen was calculated from the load-deflection relation by employing the least squares method. Fracture tough-ness was estimated with experimental data and the derived equations of strain energy release rate. Other time independent methods for estimating fracture toughness of DCB specimen were also used, and results obtained by these all estimation methods were compared with each other. In consequence, no clear distinction between two kinds of fracture toughness estimated with time dependent equation and time independent equation was observed, because the relaxation time of epoxy adhesive was relatively large...|$|E
40|$|The {{conformational}} {{properties of}} Ac-∆(Me) Ala-NHMe (N-acetyl-N-methyl-α,β-dehydroalanine N’methylamide), as the simplest model of N-methyl-α,β-dehydroamino acids, was examined with theoretical methods and {{in comparison with}} Ac-∆Ala-NHMe and Ac-∆Ala-NMe 2. The N-terminal amide of the ∆(Me) Ala residue easily adopts the configuration cis and the torsion angles φ, ψ are highly flexible. The ∆(Me) Ala residue is a conformational <b>flexibilizer</b> {{as compared to the}} parent ∆Ala, which is a conformational stiffener. This seems to be the reason why ∆(Me) Ala is found in small natural cyclic peptides, where it ensures the conformational flexibility necessary for biological action...|$|E

40|$|UV/EB {{cationic}} curing is {{an alternative}} radiation curing technology circumventing some of the free radical polymerisation disadvantages like air inhibition and poor adhesion on difficult substrates. Nowadays {{a number of new}} commercial photoinitiators, monomers and co-resins suitable for such systems are available. It can be mentioned for example trimethylolpropane oxetane (TMPO) as a non irritant highly reactive diluent as well as new oligomeric photoinitiators. In this paper, we present a number of new polyols acting as chain transfer crosslinkers and <b>flexibilizers</b> as main function.

5000|$|These {{commodity}} epoxy manufacturers {{mentioned above}} typically do not sell epoxy resins {{in a form}} usable to smaller end users, so there is another group of companies that purchase epoxy raw materials from the major producers and then compounds (blends, modifies, or otherwise customizes) epoxy systems from these raw materials. These companies are known as [...] "formulators". The majority of the epoxy systems sold are produced by these formulators and they comprise over 60% of the dollar value of the epoxy market. There are hundreds of ways that these formulators can modify epoxies—by adding mineral fillers (talc, silica, alumina, etc.), by adding <b>flexibilizers,</b> viscosity reducers, colorants, thickeners, accelerators, adhesion promoters, etc. These modifications are made to reduce costs, to improve performance, and to improve processing convenience. As a result, a typical formulator sells dozens or even thousands of formulations—each tailored {{to the requirements of}} a particular application or market.|$|R
40|$|A new epoxy {{embedding}} mixture {{for biological}} material recently {{has been introduced}} by Freeman and Spurlock (1). This mixture consists of Maraglas 655, Cardolite NC- 513, dibutyl phthalate, and the curing agent benzyldimethylamine (BDMA). Maraglas has certain advantages over other resins and epoxies, notably, wide range of miscibility, low viscosity, ease of sectioning, good staining qualities, beam stability, and little back-ground granularity. Although improvements {{have been made in}} the original technique (2), certain problems remain. The Maraglas mixture penetrates tissue very slowly, makes the tissue quite brittle, and has variable polymerization properties. In this paper the use and advantages of a new polyglycol type <b>flexibilizer</b> as a replacement for Cardolite NC- 513 in a Maraglas 655 epoxy formulation will be presented...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the effect of {{reactive}} diluents on the electrical insulation breakdown strength and mechanicalproperties of, a polyglycol and an aliphatic epoxy were individually introduced to an epoxy system. Reactive diluentswere used in order to decrease the viscosity of the epoxy system; polyglycol acted as a <b>flexibilizer</b> and 1, 4 -butanedioldiglycidyl ether (BDGE) acted as an aliphatic epoxy, which then acted as a chain extender after curing reaction. Theac electrical breakdown strength was estimated in sphere-to-sphere electrodes and the electrical breakdown strengthwas estimated by Weibull statistical analysis. The scale parameters of the electrical breakdown strengths for the epoxyresin, epoxy-polyglycol, and epoxy-BDGE were 45. 0, 46. 2, and 45. 1 kV/mm, respectively. The flexural and tensilestrengths for epoxy-BDGE were {{lower than those of}} the epoxy resin and those for epoxy-polyglycol were lower thanthose of the epoxy resin...|$|E
40|$|For the {{purposes}} of histochemistry, it is highly desirable to cure epoxy resin at room temperature without ultraviolet irradiation. A method has been devised by which a mixture of Epon 812, methyl nadic anhydride and Thiokol LP- 8 as both <b>flexibilizer</b> and hardener with DMP- 30 as accelerator can be cured at room tempera-ture (or at 50 °C) to produce a block with excellent cutting qualities. Moreover, the hardness of the cured resin can easily be adjusted by altering {{the ratio of the}} components to suit the specimens embedded in the resin mixture. Blocks of this resin are easier to section than those of the ordinary epoxy resins. Sections of tissues embedded in this resin show excellent cellular preservation, and are not degraded under electron bombardment.

40|$|Self-healing {{materials}} {{are beginning to}} be considered for applications in the field of structural materials. For this reason, in addition to self-healing efficiency, also mechanical properties such as tensile and compressive properties are beginning to become more and more important for this kind of materials. In this paper, three different systems based on epoxy-resins/ethylidene-norbornene (ENB) /Hoveyda-Grubbs 1 st-generation (HG 1) catalyst are investigated in terms of mechanical properties and healing efficiency. The experimental results show that the mechanical properties of the self-healing systems are mainly determined by the chemical nature of the epoxy matrix. In particular, the replacement of a conventional <b>flexibilizer</b> (Heloxy 71) with a reactive diluent (1, 4 -butanediol diglycidyl ether) allows obtaining self-healing materials with better mechanical properties and higher thermal stability. An increase in the curing temperature causes an increase in the elastic modulus and a slight reduction of the healing efficiency. These results can constitute the basis to design systems with high regenerative ability and appropriate mechanical performance...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{hydrophilic}} polymer membranes {{based on}} macromolecular chitosan networks have been synthesized and characterized. The {{structure of the}} membrane has been altered in several ways during the formation to adjust the properties, {{particularly with regard to}} the elasticity, tensile strength, permeability, and surface structure. An alteration of the network structure was achieved by addition of <b>flexibilizer,</b> cross-linking with dialdehydes, symplex formation of the chitosan with the polyanion sulfoethyl cellulose, and the introduction of artificial pores on the micro- and nanometer scale into the chitosan matrix with silica particles or poly(ethylene glycol). The resulting network structures and morphologies of these unique membranes that combine the novel alteration techniques have been characterized in detail and correlated with molecular parameters of the chitosan as degree of deacetylation, molar mass, and charge density. Finally, we report on the impact of the new network structures on physical properties of the membranes, the water vapor and gas permeability and the tensile strength, to evaluate possible application of the membranes as a wet wound dressing material with microbial barrier function that actively assists the healing process of problematic wounds. Parts of the novel combined membrane alteration and formation techniques are now covered by the patent DE 102004047115. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Flexible {{packaging}} {{films for}} highly sensitive {{products that are}} to be protected against moisture and oxygen need high barrier materials. In the food and pharmaceutical packaging industries, barrier films, which contain a single inorganic layer on top of a polymeric substrate, provide sufficient barrier. For the protection of more sensitive products, such as vacuum insulation panels, organic photovoltaic cells, or organic light emitting diodes, the barrier films are, however, not sufficient and multilayered structures of alternating inorganic and polymeric layers are required as encapsulation material to ensure sufficient product lifetime. One approach for the production of multilayered structures is the face-to-face lamination of two barrier films via lamination adhesives. Such multilayered structures are usually referred to as multilayered high-barrier laminates. Solvent-free, UV-curable, epoxy-based adhesives are promising candidates for multilayered high-barrier laminates. The adhesives best suited for multilayered high-barrier laminates are those that provide both high laminate bond strength as well as barrier performance. In this paper three different types of such adhesives are discussed in terms of their water vapor barrier and adhesion performance. The effects of the structural differences in the adhesives - chain mobility, crosslink density and surface energy - on the laminate bond strength and barrier performance are investigated. Laminate bond strength tests were performed and failure types and failure locations in the laminates were examined. The results suggest that the intrinsic barrier performance of the adhesive significantly affects the barrier performance of the laminate. On the other hand, the adhesive having the best barrier performance shows a weak adhesion performance. An appropriate adhesive was designed by adjusting the type of the <b>flexibilizer</b> and photoinitiator used in its formulation. This adhesive in combination with a barrier film having an enhanced surface energy shows {{at the same time a}} promising laminate bond strength as well as barrier performance...|$|E
