In other areas such as the Gulf of Thailand, it is taken year round. The species is taken by a variety of fishing methods including beach seines, gill netting, as well as hook and line methods involving jigging with lures. In parts of South East Asia, the yellowtail scad is a highly valued seafood prepared by boiling, steaming and frying. It may also by dried and salted to preserve the flesh.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This study {{attempts}} {{to look into}} the energetic status of <b>demersal</b> fish <b>species</b> with their maturity stages and evaluate their energetic condition. <b>Demersal</b> fish <b>species</b> from wild were captured, total length and weight of each fish were measured and gonads were observed, weighted and collected with fish flesh. Gonadosomatic index, water content of gonad and flesh and gonadal and somatic caloric values were measured. Gonadosomatic index varies between 0. 16 (Plectohinchus pictus) and 7. 53 (Sphyraena jello). The percent water content of gonad ranging between 3. 61 (Trichiurus lepturus) and 99. 06 (Sphyraena jello) and percent somatic water content varies between 31. 46 (Epinephelus sexfasciatus) and 85. 95 (Arius maculates). The gonadal energy content varies between 2136 cal/g (Priacanthus tayenus) and 6173 cal/g (Trixiphichthys weberi). Similarly, somatic energy content was also variable, ranging from 2429 cal/g (H. pictus) to 5581 cal/g (Epinephelus sexfasciatus).

40|$|Understanding the {{relationship}} between habitat and fish distribution is a central component in the recent shift towards ecosystem based fisheries management (EBFM). Determining the habitat requirements of commercially and ecologically important species will be essential if spatial management strategies such as marine protected areas (MP As) are to be used successfully to conserve marine resources. A review of demersal fish habitat research highlighted numerous areas lacking in this field of habitat science. These included the propensity for studies to focus on abiotic habitat variables such as depth and sediment over large spatial scales (≥ 100 s km²) and the low number of studies analysing biotic habitat variables in general. I conclude that development of sound predictive science in this field is reliant on a change in research focus toward reductions in study scale, or increases in resolution for abiotic habitat variables and more integration of biotic variables into studies. The three field studies included in this thesis analyse the importance of prey resource for the distribution of demersal fishes over spatial scales ranging from hundreds of metres to tens of kilometres. The first study investigates {{the relationship}} between prey and predator abundance and prey size and predator mouth gape size for nine <b>demersal</b> fish <b>species</b> around the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean. The results demonstrate that prey abundance and size are of significance for some <b>demersal</b> fish <b>species</b> feeding primarily on benthos and will help in defining habitat requirements of <b>demersal</b> fish <b>species.</b> <b>Demersal</b> fish feeding ecology is studied in more depth when I investigate {{the effects of a}} bottom trawl fishery on an invertebrate benthic community and the subsequent effects this has on two commercially important flatfishes (P. platessa and L. limanda). This chapter closes the gap between the effects of bottom fishing on benthic communities and the reduced condition of some fishes found within these areas. The {{results of this study suggest}} that alterations in prey abundances, sizes and availabilities caused by chronic bottom trawling may lead to reduced feeding efficiencies, particularly for species with narrow prey spectrums. This in turn could result in reduced conditions of affected fishes living in chronically disturbed areas. The final data chapter uses detailed habitat maps, based on differences in sediment characteristics between three sites to take a small spatial scale, high resolution approach to describing demersal fish habitat. This investigates changes in the feeding ecology of a <b>demersal</b> fish <b>species,</b> Callionymus lyra, with body length. Although significant differences in prey size and prey taxa selectivity were found, no significant relationships between prey resource and predator distribution were apparent for any of the year classes analysed. The potential ecological and methodological reasons for these findings are discussed in-depth. Finally, a general discussion examines the main findings and suggests areas for future development.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{makes use of}} the {{fisheries}} survey data collected during the period 1984 - 87 by the multi-purpose research vessel RV Anusandhani {{in the waters of}} Bangladesh, Bay of Bengal. The data consists of twelve survey cruises directed at the shrimp resources (1985 - 87) and nineteen survey cruises directed at the demersal fish resources (1984 - 86). The biomasses for shrimp and demersal fish during the survey period were estimated, along with a detailed analysis of biomass distribution by depth zone and catch rates for important species of shrimp and <b>demersal</b> fish <b>species.</b> The <b>demersal</b> fish and shrimp biomass during the survey period was estimated as 176 160 t and 857 t, respectively. The levels of biomass when compared with 1973 estimates indicate a tremendous decline, by about 90 % for shrimps and 30 % for demersal fish. Population parameters for four species of shrimps (for both males and females) as well as for eight <b>demersal</b> fish <b>species</b> were also estimated. The parameter estimates were validated using available growth and mortality parameter values from the literature, and were in turn used to estimate the mean exploitation rate (E) of demersal fish and shrimp species comprising the trawl catch. Mean E values for shrimp species is at 0. 61 and 0. 57 for <b>demersal</b> fish <b>species,</b> indicating over-exploitation of demersal resources in the Bay of Bengal. Exploratory analysis using surplus production modeling of catch and effort data shows that the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) level for shrimp resources is around 3 500 t, corresponding to a maximum effort level of approximately 6 480 fishing days. Similar analysis for demersal fish catches gave poor correlations between catch rates and fishing effort.

40|$|In the ocean, {{energy is}} {{transferred}} from the productive primary producers at the surface, down to the demersal fish fauna at the sea floor. When {{moving away from the}} surface layer, there is a decline in food availability, and <b>demersal</b> fish <b>species</b> has evolved different feeding strategies due to this (Merrett and Haedrich, 1997). Even though many studies have researched feeding ecology of <b>demersal</b> fish <b>species</b> in the ocean, {{little is known about the}} feeding ecology of <b>demersal</b> fish <b>species</b> in fjords. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the feeding ecology of roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), a <b>demersal</b> fish <b>species,</b> in two Norwegian fjords. Three hypotheses were predicted; (1) that the diet would consist of mesopelagic fish and invertebrates, and benthic crustacean. (2) That diet and food composition would differ between the fjords. (3) Due to the importance of pelagic prey, a difference in prey composition and food amount would be found as a diurnal pattern, and there will be evidence that grenadiers migrate upwards during day or night to feed on pelagic prey. Stomach content of 303 roundnose grenadiers were analyzed to investigate importance of prey groups and differences between and within fjords. Pre-anal fin-length, weight, gonadosomatic index and hepatosomatic index were measured and calculated. In total, the diet consisted mostly of pelagic and benthic crustaceans, 19 % consisted of non-crustacean taxa. No major differences were found in prey composition between the fjords, with the exception of chaetognaths, which were only found as prey in Masfjord. Size of the grenadier influenced the foraging upon polychaetas and euphasids. Fish from Lustrafjord had more stomach content relative to body weight, while the Masfjord population had a higher distribution of sexually matured fish and more stored resources in the liver. There were no clear diurnal differences in consumed prey taxa or in food amount, but in general, pelagically caught fish contained more pelagic prey. Overall, diet analyses showed that roundnose grenadiers from two Norwegian fjords utilize food resources in both pelagic and demersal zone, and that size has an effect when specializing on specific prey groups such as krill and polychaetas. The feeding ecology of C. rupestris is similar to other populations in the Northwest-Atlantic, and they feed mostly on Amphipoda, Copepoda, Euphausiacea, Polychaetae and Mollusca, and are classified as 2 nd or 3 rd carnivorous consumer. Low amounts of fish found in the stomach content revealed that they rarely feed on fish. Diet consisted both of pelagic and benthic prey, no clear diurnal differences were found. Although the importance of pelagic prey was found, a diel vertical migration pattern could not be confirmed...|$|R
