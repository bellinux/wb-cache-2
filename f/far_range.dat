60|$|He {{drank some}} tea; went out, {{and took a}} path up to the moor. It was not yet eight o'clock {{when he reached the}} top of the nearest tor. And there, below him, around, and above, was a land and sky transcending even his exaltation. It was like a symphony of great music; or the nobility of a stupendous mind laid bare; it was God up there, in His many moods. Serenity was spread in the middle heavens, blue, illimitable, and along to the East, three huge clouds, like {{thoughts}} brooding over the destinies below, moved slowly toward the sea, so that great shadows filled the valleys. And the land that lay under all the other sky was gleaming, and quivering with every colour, as it were, clothed with the divine smile. The wind, from the North, whereon floated the white birds of the smaller clouds, had no voice, for it was above barriers, utterly free. Before Miltoun, turning to this wind, lay the maze of the lower lands, the misty greens, rose pinks, and browns of the fields, and white and grey dots and strokes of cottages and church towers, fading into the blue veil of distance, confined by a <b>far</b> <b>range</b> of hills. Behind him there was nothing but the restless surface of the moor, coloured purplish-brown. On that untamed sea of graven wildness could be seen no ship of man, save one, on the far horizon--the grim hulk, Dartmoor Prison. There was no sound, no scent, and it seemed to Miltoun as if his spirit had left his body, and become part of the solemnity of God. Yet, as he stood there, with his head bared, that strange smile which haunted him in moments of deep feeling, showed that he had not surrendered to the Universal, that his own spirit was but being fortified, and that this was the true and secret source of his delight. He lay down in a scoop of the stones. The sun entered there, but no wind, so that a dry sweet scent exuded from the young shoots of heather. That warmth and perfume crept through the shield of his spirit, and stole into his blood; ardent images rose before him, the vision of an unending embrace. Out of an embrace sprang Life, out of that the World was made, this World, with its innumerable forms, and natures--no two alike! And from him and her would spring forms to take their place in the great pattern. This seemed wonderful, and right-for they would be worthy forms, who would hand on those traditions which seemed to him so necessary and great. And then there broke on him one of those delirious waves of natural desire, against which he had so often fought, so often with great pain conquered. He got up, and ran downhill, leaping over the stones, and the thicker clumps of heather.|$|E

50|$|The {{battles of}} Dragon Seeds are fought in {{traditional}} 1 vs 1 matches, on a semi rotating screen between the player and the challenger's dragons. The battle is fought in turn-based rock, paper, scissors rotations with a timer that counts down during each player's phase of action. The player can command the dragon to either move forward, backward, use a physical or magical attack, defend, or taunt. The player must equip the dragon {{with a weapon}} and shield, called a reflector, for the dragon {{to be able to}} enter combat. In battle, there are 3 main positions in which the dragon can be in: Close, Mid, and <b>Far</b> <b>range.</b> Each dragon can be at max 2 ranges apart from their opponent. Only at close range can a dragon successfully perform a physical attack. At mid and far ranges, the dragon can perform magical attacks attuned with their element, or taunt. The player must choose correct judgment and a bit of luck to win battles successfully.|$|E

The results show the DEM influence in range direction has a direct ratio relation with the elevation and perpendicular baseline but an inverse ratio relation with the distance from near to <b>far</b> <b>range,</b> the DEM influence in azimuth direction has a direct ratio relation with the elevation but small correlation with the perpendicular baseline and the distance from near to <b>far</b> <b>range.</b> Moreover, in the polynomial approach different orders of the polynomial are needed in different topographies to achieve more accurate offset result. 1...|$|E

Alternatively, as noted earlier, confidence in No IDs could be collected {{in such a way}} as to allow one to project the ROC further to the right (i.e., by collecting a confidence rating in connection with the face that the witness believes is most likely to be the perpetrator). Looking at the two ROC curves in Fig. 5 and mentally projecting the sequential ROC curve to the right, it seems fairly safe to assume it would still fall below the simultaneous ROC. Nevertheless, to be sure about that, one would have to actually perform the experiment because it is at least theoretically possible that the ROC curves would cross and the sequential procedure would become superior in that higher <b>FAR</b> <b>range.</b> Despite that theoretical possibility, in the <b>FAR</b> <b>range</b> covered by this analysis (0 to [...]. 038), data like these would indicate a simultaneous superiority effect.|$|E
