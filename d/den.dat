5|$|Like wolves, coyotes use a <b>den</b> (usually {{the deserted}} holes of other species) when gestating and rearing young, {{though they may}} {{occasionally}} give birth under sagebrushes in the open. Coyote dens can be located in canyons, washouts, coulees, banks, rock bluffs, or level ground. Some dens have been found under abandoned homestead shacks, grain bins, drainage pipes, railroad tracks, hollow logs, thickets, and thistles. The <b>den</b> is continuously dug and cleaned out by the female until the pups are born. Should the <b>den</b> be disturbed or infested with fleas, the pups are moved into another <b>den.</b> A coyote <b>den</b> can have several entrances and passages branching out from the main chamber. A single <b>den</b> can be used year after year.|$|E
5|$|After {{a time of}} {{not seeing}} Tigerstar, Sasha returns to her <b>den</b> one evening, only to find Tigerstar already waiting for her. Asking him where he was, he {{comments}} on how nice her <b>den</b> was, and then stops and asks when she will be seeing her humans again, after seeing her collar hanging around a protruding branch on the logs. Sasha asks him why he was snooping around in her <b>den,</b> and he tells her that he cannot see her any more if she has the collar. She refuses to destroy it, and quarrels with Tigerstar about housecats {{and how they are}} not independent. Sad, she reminisces about her perfect life with Jean and Ken.|$|E

5|$|Like other otters, the North American {{river otter}} {{lives in a}} holt, or <b>den,</b> {{constructed}} in the burrows of other animals, or in natural hollows, such as under a log or in river banks. An entrance, which may be under water or above ground, leads to a nest chamber lined with leaves, grass, moss, bark, and hair. <b>Den</b> sites include burrows dug by woodchucks (Marmota monax), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), nutria (Myocastor coypus), or beaver and muskrat lodges. River otters also may use hollow trees or logs, undercut banks, rock formations, backwater sloughs, and flood debris. The use of <b>den</b> and resting sites is chiefly opportunistic, although locations that provide protection and seclusion are preferred.|$|E
40|$|Polar bears {{construct}} maternity <b>dens</b> in {{the snow}} throughout their range. The Owl River maternity <b>denning</b> a r e a on the Manitoba coast of Hudson Bay, Canada, had a measured productivity of 100 - 150 cubs in 1970 and 1971. Maternity <b>denning</b> is now confirmed for the Twin Islands in James Bay, but estimates of productivity for James Bay and the Ontario coast of Hudson Bay should still be made. Female polar bea rs build a variety of <b>dens</b> {{in the vicinity of}} their winter <b>dens</b> and along their route a s they move to the sea ice. This makes the censusing of maternity <b>dens</b> and estimating of productivity difficult. The winter <b>dens</b> in Hudson and James bays differ from high arc t ic <b>dens</b> in that earth chambers a r e used, with snow <b>dens</b> added a s winter progresses. Summer <b>denning</b> occurs along the Manitoba and Ontario coasts of Hudson Bay, and on the islands in James Bay. Surface pits, shallow <b>dens</b> and deep burrows a r e the three basic types of ear th <b>dens</b> built. All three types appear to be con-structed for temperature regulation by the bears, but each type is sometimes used la ter for shelter, protection from insects, protection from other bea rs or for winter <b>dens.</b> These behavioural adaptations appear significant in delineating a discrete polar bear population for James Bay and southern Hudson Bay...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} snow <b>dens</b> by polar bears during two summers on northern Baffk and Bylot Islands. More <b>dens</b> were found during 1976 than 1975, probably because of heavier snow during 1976. <b>Dens</b> were of three types, shallow surface pits, shallow <b>dens,</b> and deep burrows. This paper describes, for the first time, the use of snow <b>dens</b> by polar bears (Ursus maritimus Phipps) during the summer. Polar bears have long been known to use snow <b>dens</b> during winter throughout their range (Harington, 1 % 8; L$n & 1970; Jonkel et al., 1972; Uspenski and Kistchinski, 1972; Lentfer, 1976). These <b>dens</b> provide escape from inclement weather for probably all sex and age classes of polar bears and maternity shelter for parturient females (Harington, 1968; Van de Velde, 1971). Polar bears also use earth <b>dens</b> during the summer along the coasts and on the islands of southern Hudson and James Bays as places to avoid heat and insects when they come onto land during the ice free period (Jonke et al., 1972). Some earth <b>dens</b> {{may be used for}} winter maternity <b>dens...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Here we outline a {{new method}} for synthesizing fully reduced Pt dendrimer-encapsulated {{nanoparticles}} (<b>DENs).</b> This {{is achieved by}} first synthesizing Cu <b>DENs</b> of the appropriate size through sequential dendrimer loading and reduction steps, and then galvanically exchanging the zerovalent Cu <b>DENs</b> for Pt. The properties of Pt <b>DENs</b> having an average of 55, 140, and 225 atoms prepared by direct chemical reduction and by galvanic exchange are compared. Data obtained by UV−vis spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and high-resolution electron microscopy confirm only the presence of fully reduced Pt <b>DENs</b> when synthesized by galvanic exchange, while chemical reduction leads to a mixture of reduced <b>DENs</b> and unreduced precursor. These results are significant because Pt <b>DENs</b> are good models for developing {{a better understanding of}} the effects of finite size on catalytic reactions. Until now, however, the results of such studies have been complicated by a heterogeneous mixture of Pt catalysts. Dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (<b>DENs)</b> are well...|$|R
