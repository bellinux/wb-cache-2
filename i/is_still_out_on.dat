500|$|This episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews. Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic {{said that the}} plot of the episode had a [...] "nice story arc when the cause of death ranged from disease, to suicide, and finally murder". She added that Nikki's family was a [...] "nightmare". She was surprised that Bill was not involved in killing Nikki, saying that he [...] "came across as a bit of a jerk for most of the episode", adding that Nikki had a [...] "short, sad life". Orlando praised the detail of Nikki's neck, noticing the bruising to show she was strangled. She said, [...] "I generally hate gore yet I found myself fascinated by the autopsy of the girl's neck. Maybe it was the detail of the muscle and the lack of blood but I've never seen such a procedure portrayed with that level of specificity". Orlando carried on saying, [...] "Is there some rule that we can't have both detectives every week? Detective Baker's definitely growing on me but I missed Bud. He and Megan had some great chemistry and I was hoping for more of {{that by the end of}} the season". Orlando understood Megan's reaction to the fact that Kate was dating Todd, calling it [...] "justified", saying it was an [...] "odd position to be in", but summarized; [...] "she'll just have to get over it". Orlando was worried whether Todd deserved Kate saying that; [...] "the jury <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> Todd". She praised how this storyline turned out to be a [...] "great bonding moment" [...] between Megan and Lacey, saying she [...] "liked" [...] that Megan was honest with Lacey adding, [...] "I like it when adults actually act like adults".|$|E

However, Sinclair landed some of his embarked troops to make an encampment on the spit of land between the river and the lake shore, and some wood-cutting parties discovered the schooner's hiding place.|$|R

The judge ordered the company to [...] "stop producing, manufacturing, creating, and renting" [...] edited movies, and to hand all inventory to movie studios within five days of the ruling. The court gave the company more time than the rulings initial five-day deadline for turning over the stock of edited movies, since CleanFlicks needed more time to receive movies which <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> rental.|$|R

He's upset and angry, especially when Kat tries to explain how he made her feel when he accused her of sleeping with someone else when she got pregnant again. He obviously didn't mean the things he said then – he just said them {{in the heat of the}} moment, but those words have stuck with Kat." [...] Asked whether Alfie appreciates Kat's honesty, he replied: [...] "Not at all – he'd rather not know. Deep down, Alfie knows that Kat has done things in the past that maybe she shouldn't have, but he didn't know all the details. Now he knows Kat has been unfaithful, he has got to confront the fact. The jury <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> that one," [...] he explained. [...] "I don't know, if I'm honest. They always seem to take two steps forward and then one step back...

50|$|It {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be less 'hair-shirt' than the slightly older OMM formerly Karrimor (OMM), since the weather is often mild, the courses slightly shorter, and the overnight camp is often found to be {{within walking distance of}} a pub. However, there have been notable exceptions to this - in 2004 (the 26th event, out of Coniston) consistently poor weather over two days forced many teams to retire.

5000|$|Seven {{months after}} the brand's launch, Loblaw {{reported}} that sales had exceeded the company's own projections. “Every one of our sales objectives that we have set, we have surpassed", noted Louise Drouin, {{senior vice president of}} general merchandise. Mimran also expressed his personal satisfaction with the brand's acceptance among consumers. [...] "I've been involved with many projects over the years, and I can tell you the response to this has been overwhelming." [...] But retail consultant, Dalan Bronson of the J.C.

5000|$|According to {{historian}} Thomas Pakenham, [...] "In practice, {{the farms}} of Boer collaborators got burnt too - burnt by mistake by Tommies or in reprisal by the commandos. So Kitchener {{added a new}} twist to farm-burning. He decided that his soldiers should not only strip the farms of stock, but should take the families, too. Women and children would be concentrated in 'camps of refuge' along the railway line. In fact, these camps consisted of two kinds of civilians: genuine refugees - that is, the families of Boers who were helping the British, or at least keeping their oath of neutrality - and internees, the families of men who <b>were</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> commando. The difference was crucial, for at first there were two different scales of rations: little enough in practice for the refugees, and a recklessly low scale for the internees." ...|$|R

The boat left port under the flag of the Navy of Serbia and Montenegro, but because Montenegro declared its independence on 6 June while the boat <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> exercise, Hasan Zahirović-Laca became the first ship outside of Montenegrin waters to display the flag of the new country. The boat was decommissioned later that year, along with the first boat of the class, Rade Končar. The latter was sold to Kenya in 2014 for an undisclosed price. The Kenyan Navy plans on stripping the boat of its guns and fire-control systems which would then be overhauled and installed on the offshore patrol vessel KNS Jasiri. Rade Končar itself is then expected to be rebuilt and used by the Navy as a patrol boat. The fate of Hasan Zahirović-Laca remains unknown.|$|R

5000|$|McElmo Phase {{refers to}} a period in the late 11th and early 12th centuries, when drastic changes in {{ceramics}} and masonry techniques in Chaco Canyon appeared.
