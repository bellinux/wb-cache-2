5|$|Sitting in Padmasana (lotus) posture, {{the text}} {{states that the}} pranayama or {{breathing}} must be <b>gradual,</b> both inhalation, holding and exhalation should be slow, steady and deep. The text introduces a series of time measures (matras, musical beats) to aid self monitoring and to measure progress, wherein the beat is created by the yoga student with fingers self circumambulating and using one's own knee for the beat pulse. A sequential <b>gradual</b> inhalation over sixteen Matras (digits), holding the air deep within for sixty-four Matras and gradually exhaling the air over thirty-two Matras is suggested as {{the goal of the}} breathing exercise.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–08 {{volcanic}} activity of Mount St. Helens {{has been documented}} as a continuous eruption with a <b>gradual</b> extrusion of magma at the Mount St. Helens volcano. Starting in October 2004 there was a <b>gradual</b> building of a new lava dome. The new dome did not rise above the caldera created by the 1980 eruption. This activity lasted until January 2008.|$|E
5|$|The extinctions of Macroolithus {{and other}} eggs from Southern China {{have also had}} a history of {{different}} interpretations. In the 1990s, Chinese paleontologists, including the prominent egg specialist Zhao Zikui, observed a <b>gradual</b> reduction in dinosaur egg diversity during the final 200,000 to 300,000 years of the Cretaceous, with only Macroolithus ranging up to the boundary. They postulated, contrary to the impact hypothesis, that the extinction {{was the result of a}} prolonged drought that increased the concentration of trace heavy metals, which adversely affected eggshell and embryo development of the dinosaurs causing the population to gradually decline and collapse. Zhao et al. revised this hypothesis in 2002, postulating a <b>gradual</b> extinction of Macroolithus caused by the volcanism of the Deccan Traps. In 2004, Buck et al. disputed this interpretation, arguing that the apparent <b>gradual</b> extinction was an illusion caused by reworking of sediments. Zhao et al. (2009) maintained that the extinction event was <b>gradual.</b>|$|E

5|$|The mass {{extinction}} of marine plankton {{appears to have}} been abrupt and right at the K–Pg boundary. Ammonite genera became extinct at or near the K–Pg boundary; however, there was a smaller and slower extinction of ammonite genera prior to the boundary that was associated with a late Cretaceous marine regression. The <b>gradual</b> extinction of most inoceramid bivalves began well before the K–Pg boundary, and a small, <b>gradual</b> reduction in ammonite diversity occurred throughout the very late Cretaceous.|$|E

5|$|A few kennels {{breeding}} their ancestors, the St. John's water dog, were in England. At {{the same}} time, {{a combination of}} the sheep protection policy in Newfoundland and rabies quarantine in the United Kingdom, led to the <b>gradual</b> demise of the St. John's water dog in Canada.|$|E
5|$|A {{period of}} reform {{occurred}} between 49 BC, when Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon, and 29 BC, when Octavian returned to Rome after Actium. During this period the previous century's <b>gradual</b> unravelling of republican institutions accelerated rapidly. By 29 BC, Rome had completed its {{transition from a}} city-state with a network of dependencies to the capital of a world empire.|$|E
5|$|A {{year before}} their 1972 Eldredge and Gould paper, Niles Eldredge {{published}} {{a paper in}} the journal Evolution which suggested that <b>gradual</b> evolution was seldom seen in the fossil record and argued that Ernst Mayr's standard mechanism of allopatric speciation might suggest a possible resolution.|$|E
5|$|Acton's severe {{judgement}} did {{not deter}} Waugh from {{his intention to}} be a writer, but it affected his belief that he could succeed as a novelist.

In the 2000s, Unarius' leaders emphasized individual transformation, focusing on a <b>gradual</b> spiritual change in humanity.|$|E
5|$|Appreciation of art {{among the}} gentry class flourished during the Song dynasty, {{especially}} {{in regard to}} paintings, which is an art practiced by many. Trends in painting styles amongst the gentry notably shifted from the Northern (960–1127) to Southern Song (1127–1279) periods, influenced {{in part by the}} <b>gradual</b> embrace of the Neo-Confucian political ideology at court.|$|E
5|$|By {{the same}} token, the {{viability}} of the benshi system facilitated a <b>gradual</b> transition to sound—allowing the studios to spread out the capital costs of conversion and their directors and technical crews time to become familiar with the new technology.|$|E
5|$|Clovis the Frank, {{the first}} {{king of the}} Merovingian dynasty, made the city his capital from 508. A <b>gradual</b> {{immigration}} by the Franks also occurred in Paris {{in the beginning of}} the Frankish domination of Gaul which created the Parisian Francien dialects.|$|E
5|$|Galveston {{became a}} major port of entry for illegal liquor from Mexico and Canada, shipped through the Caribbean and {{distributed}} from the island throughout Texas and to other destinations. Galveston became the primary supplier for Houston, Dallas, Denver, St. Louis and Omaha. This traffic helped to offset the <b>gradual</b> loss of shipping traffic in the cotton and sulfur trade.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gradual</b> {{weakening}} {{occurred as}} Dot neared Hainan Island on June9. The typhoon subsequently made landfall near Sanya on June10 and weakened to a tropical storm. Later that day, the storm emerged into the Gulf of Tonkin before making its {{third and final}} landfall near Hai Phong, Vietnam. Once onshore, Dot quickly degraded over the mountainous terrain of northern Vietnam, and was last noted on June12.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} (HE) is {{an altered}} level of consciousness {{as a result}} of liver failure. Onset may be <b>gradual</b> or sudden. Other symptoms may include movement problems, changes in mood, or changes in personality. In the advanced stages it can result in a coma.|$|E
5|$|In the 1st century AD {{the complex}} {{underwent}} a major expansion.

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the union, the process of <b>gradual</b> Polonization gained steady momentum. In culture and social life, both the Polish language and Catholicism became dominant, and in 1696, Polish replaced Belarusian as the official language—with the Belarusian language being banned from administrative use. However, the local Ruthenian peasants, continued to speak their own language and remained faithful to the Eastern Orthodox church.|$|E
5|$|Insects are prey for {{a variety}} of organisms, {{including}} terrestrial vertebrates. The earliest vertebrates on land existed 400 million years ago and were large amphibious piscivores. Through <b>gradual</b> evolutionary change, insectivory was the next diet type to evolve.|$|E
5|$|Lower demand {{triggered}} by the 1997–1998 Asian financial crisis saw {{the price of oil}} fall back to 1986 levels. After oil slumped to around US$10/bbl, joint diplomacy achieved a <b>gradual</b> slowing of oil production by OPEC, Mexico and Norway.|$|E
5|$|M. lashuyuanensis – this oospecies {{is based}} on an eggshell {{fragment}} found in the Nanxiong Basin of Guangdong. With a thickness of , its eggshell is the thickest among Macroolithus oospecies.

5|$|Many of the drapers {{supported}} Parliament {{during the}} civil war, {{and as a consequence}} the Company was not given royal support after the monarchy was restored in 1660 under Charles II (r. 1660–85). The cloth trade went into a <b>gradual</b> decline after this date.|$|E
5|$|More taxonomic {{changes have}} {{occurred}} at the genus level, although these revisions have proven more conclusive, often supported by genetic and molecular analysis. The most noticeable revisions included the <b>gradual</b> split of a broadly defined genus Lemur into separate genera for the ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemurs, and brown lemurs due {{to a host of}} morphological differences.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, {{there were}} {{continuing}} <b>gradual</b> economic improvements, {{among the most}} visible {{of which was the}} replacement of the traditional thatched blackhouse with accommodation of a more modern design and in recent years, with the assistance of Highlands and Islands Enterprise many of the island's populations have begun to increase after decades of decline.|$|E

5|$|Orthogenesis was the {{hypothesis}} that life has an innate tendency to change, in a unilinear fashion, towards ever-greater perfection. It had a significant following in the 19th century, and its proponents included the Russian biologist Leo S. Berg and the American paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn. Orthogenesis was popular among some paleontologists, who believed that the fossil record showed a <b>gradual</b> and constant unidirectional change.|$|E
5|$|Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's metaphysical Omega Point theory, {{found in}} his book The Phenomenon of Man (1955), {{describes}} the <b>gradual</b> development of the universe from subatomic particles to human society, which he viewed as its final stage and goal.|$|E
5|$|Punctuated {{equilibrium}} {{is commonly}} contrasted against phyletic gradualism, {{the idea that}} evolution generally occurs uniformly and by the steady and <b>gradual</b> transformation of whole lineages (called anagenesis).
