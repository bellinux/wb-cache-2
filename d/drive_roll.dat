50|$|Spring punches, {{also called}} roll pin punches, {{are used to}} <b>drive</b> <b>roll</b> pins. Standard pin punches should never be used on a roll pin. Because of the hollow, thin wall {{construction}} of a roll pin, a standard pin punch will often collapse, mar or distort {{the end of the}} pin or be driven into, and jammed inside, the hollow core of the roll pin. When choosing a roll pin punch, select one that is no larger than the compressed diameter of the pin. If a punch is used that is larger than the pin,the surrounding metal in which the pin is seated can be damaged. Also, a roll pin punch should not be used which is smaller than the compressed diameter of the pin. If this occurs, {{it may be possible to}} drive the punch through the hollow center of the roll pin.|$|E

The drive roll’s natural frequency and vibration mode concerned in reality were acquired based on modal analysis, deformation trend and size of each mode shape were analysed, then deformation of the weak positions about each mode was cleared, and some measures about improving its dynamic characteristics were proposed, all of these offered a support to strengthen drive roll’s damping property...|$|E

During the ring rolling, the average equivalent plastic stain (PEEQa) is increasing with bigger idle roll speed and lower <b>drive</b> <b>roll</b> rotational velocity. And {{the changing of the}} standard error criterion of the equivalent plastic strain (SDP) is similar to the equivalent plastic strain PEEQ.

The wire feeder incorporates a 25, 000 step-per-revolution motor to power a urethane-coated <b>drive</b> <b>roll.</b> A microprocessor-based controller provides precise control of the motor and allows both continuous and pulsed feeding of the wire. A unidirectional 0. 75 -in. -dia ball bearing is used to press the wire against the <b>drive</b> <b>roll.</b> A slight constant backward tension is maintained on the wire spool by a Bodine torque motor. A Teflon tube is used to guide the wire from the <b>drive</b> <b>roll</b> to the vicinity of the weld, where a hypodermic needle is used to aim the wire into the weld pool. The operation of the wire feeder was demonstrated by feeding a 10 -mil-dia, Type 304 stainless steel wire into a variety of CO{sub 2 } laser beam welds. The resulting welds are smooth and continuous, and the welds are considered to be completely satisfactory for a variety of applications...|$|E

Took {{the heavy}} {{cylinder}} rolling mill as subject investigated, {{which is used}} to produce the nuclear power cylinder, the large hydrogenation reactor cylinder and the coal liquefaction reactor cylinder. And the cylinder rolling mill has two <b>drive</b> <b>rolls</b> which is different from conventional ring rolling mill. The rolling theory of heavy cylinder rolling mill was researched deeply based on mechanism method, including the biting condition, the plastic penetration condition, the feed condition and the feed velocity condition; the rolling force parameters of heavy cylinder rolling mill with two <b>drive</b> <b>rolls</b> were calculated based on the slip line method (SLM) and finite element method (FEM), and the simulation and industrial experiment were done; the influences of main technology parameters such as feed velocity, friction coefficient and temperature on the rolling force parameters were analyzed. The results show that the error of calculated rolling force and the measured value is less than 5 %, which proves that the basic conditions deduced by theory method are correct, the models established based on SLM and FEM are correct. And with the increase of feed velocity, the rolling force increase, after a rolling circle, the rolling force fluctuates at a constant value; with the increase of friction coefficient, the rolling force increase; with the increase of initial temperature, the rolling force decrease...|$|R

50|$|Ring rolling is a {{specialized}} type of hot rolling {{that increases the}} diameter of a ring. The starting material is a thick-walled ring. This workpiece is placed between two rolls, an inner idler <b>roll</b> and a <b>driven</b> <b>roll,</b> which presses the ring from the outside. As the rolling occurs the wall thickness decreases as the diameter increases. The rolls may be shaped to form various cross-sectional shapes. The resulting grain structure is circumferential, which gives better mechanical properties. Diameters can be as large as 8 m and face heights as tall as 2 m. Common applications include bearings, gears, rockets, turbines, airplanes, pipes, and pressure vessels.|$|R

50|$|Tension {{adjustment}} is necessary due to several mechanical factors: oscillations caused by mechanical misalignments, differing inertial response (lag) of mechanical elements during web acceleration, out-of-round unwind and tension rolls, slipping through nip rolls, and over-aggressive web-guide correction. Several technical process and control issues also affect tension: tension setpoint changes, phase offset on <b>driven</b> <b>rolls,</b> tension bleed from one zone to another, and thermal effect (contraction/expansion) as the substrate passes through various processes. It {{is impossible to}} eliminate all factors requiring tension adjustment. Variance in any one factor in a zone necessitates changes in tension control and web speed. Consequently, with coupled tension zone control, jitter is inevitable in a continuous web where the controllers cause a feedback loop.|$|R

The reasonable value range of the mandrel feed rate was verified by using numerical simulation method. The results indicate that the reasonable value range of the mandrel feed rate is feasible, the proposed mandrel feeding strategy can realize a steady RCRRCDS process, and the forming quality of conical ring rolled by using the proposed feeding strategy is better than that of conical ring rolled by using a constant mandrel feed rate...|$|R

Lumped model of an experimental multi-span web transport system is based on the conservation mass, torque balance and viscoelasticity. A new way for describing this kind of MIMO system has been introduced through a four by four Transfer Matrix which considers mutual interactions between inputs and outputs. Finally, comparing experimental data with Transfer Matrix parametric expressions, it has been possible to identify the system parameters and thus fully validate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic lumped model.

40|$|The {{formation}} of deformation texture {{is an important}} material characteristic which influences {{the behavior of a}} material. A textured material usually exhibits certain levels of anisotropy {{which may or may not}} be desirable from a practical point of view. During a forming process, strip is progressively bent into complex shapes by passing it through a series of <b>driven</b> <b>rolls</b> or dies. Normally, punches and dies are designed so that successive stages in the forming of the part are carried out in the same die on each stroke of the press in a progressive forming method. However, total automation and the improvement of productivity and quality of the products is frustrated by the variability of the physical and mechanical properties of material feed stock. The directionalities of properties produced by rolling and other primary working processes can have important consequences on the fabricability of the material. For example, sometimes bending is more difficult when the bend line is parallel to the rolling direction than when the bend is made perpendicular to the rolling direction...|$|R

Then, the plastic penetration and biting-in conditions for ILRRCDS were deduced based on plain ring rolling theory. Moreover, a feeding strategy that can realize a constant growth of the ring’s outer radius was proposed and the reasonable value ranges of the feed rate of the mandrel were determined. The numerical simulation model for ILRRCDS is established based on ABAQUS software. Finally, the equivalent plastic strain (PEEQ) and temperature distributions of rolled ring were obtained. The results indicated that the proposed feeding strategy can realize a stable ILRRCDS. At the end of ILRRCDS, the PEEQ at the inner radius surface of the ring is maximum, the PEEQ at the outer radius surface of the ring takes the second place, and the PEEQ at the middle part of ring is minimum.
