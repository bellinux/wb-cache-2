5|$|In {{the third}} series, Mark Schwartz, {{the head of}} Planet B, announces that the {{original}} Planet B is to shut down and replaced by a new service, Planet B Platinum. He claims it {{is to provide a}} new service, but it <b>is</b> <b>really</b> designed to kill all the rogues in the old site.|$|E
5|$|McCarthy {{responded that}} {{what people do}} is irrelevant. He argued that what <b>is</b> <b>really</b> needed are {{machines}} that can solve problems—not machines that think as people do.|$|E
5|$|Don't Look Now {{is renowned}} for its {{innovative}} editing style and its use of recurring motifs and themes and for a controversial sex scene that was explicit for its time. The film often employs flashbacks and flashforwards {{in keeping with the}} depiction of precognition, but some scenes are intercut or merged to alter the viewer's perception of what <b>is</b> <b>really</b> happening. It adopts an impressionist approach to its imagery, often presaging events with familiar objects, patterns and colours using associative editing techniques.|$|E

5|$|Ezra Pound <b>is</b> <b>really</b> {{at heart}} a very boyish fellow and an incurable provincial. It {{is true that}} he was driven to Europe by a thirst for romance and color that he could {{scarcely}} have satisfied in America, but he took to Europe the simple faith and pure enthusiasm of his native Idaho.... His sophistication is still juvenile, his ironies are still clumsy and obvious, he ridicules Americans in Europe not very much simpler than himself...|$|E
5|$|Fielding's sixteenth play, The Mock Doctor: or The Dumb Lady Cur'd, {{replaced}} The Covent Garden Tragedy as {{the companion}} play to The Old Debauchees. The play is an Anglicised adaptation of Molière's Le Medecin malgre Lui. It first ran on 23 June 1732 {{and was later}} revised in 1732; both versions were very successful. The plot deals with a young girl pretending to be mute {{to avoid having to}} marry a man she does not like while her doctor <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a man pretending to be a doctor to con the other characters.|$|E
5|$|I can quite {{understand}} the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son's name being {{coupled with the}} thing {{but that was the}} case before I left it... we were both accused of going to this place but not together... they will end by having out in open court exactly what they are all trying to keep quiet. I wonder if it <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a fact or only an invention of that arch ruffian H.|$|E

500|$|... "The show <b>is</b> gonna <b>be</b> <b>really,</b> really theatrical—it's really complicated. It's {{a massive}} {{show with a}} lot of new music. It's just gonna <b>be</b> <b>really</b> different. [...] You're gonna learn a lot more about her as a person. The show <b>is</b> gonna <b>be</b> <b>really</b> about how she's {{becoming}} a woman, how she's finding herself and her independence. She knows what she wants to do, she knows who she wants to be, and that's what the show's about." ...|$|R
5000|$|She <b>was</b> <b>really</b> crucial. She <b>was</b> a <b>really</b> great {{sounding}} board for me. She's {{a really good}} producer {{in the sense that}} she's very musical and has a great sense of song structure and so forth. So she was great to bounce ideas off. And she sang on nearly all the songs. So she <b>was</b> <b>really</b> a great part of this record.|$|R
5|$|I was {{thinking}} about how Portland is designed and planned and built, and how the planning and infrastructure of Portland <b>is</b> <b>really</b> important in what makes Portland great. I {{was thinking}} of the static tripod as the infrastructure. The moving part was the vibrancy and life.... The most interesting part of the sculpture will be watching people try to move it.|$|E
5|$|Susan and Karl Kennedy {{decide to}} take in {{exchange}} student, Sunny, following their step daughter's departure. On her first night with the Kennedys, Sunny calls into the Pirate Net radio station and speaks to 'Lost Boy' about her past and {{her relationship with her}} sister. Sunny believes that she has humiliated herself by talking too much about her life. She then decides to find out who 'Lost Boy' is, so she can confront him. She is unaware that he <b>is</b> <b>really</b> her housemate, Zeke Kinski.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{marked the}} first time {{composer}} Michael Giacchino worked with assistant Chad Seiter on a Fringe episode. Seiter would continue to score the rest of the season's first half. Joshua Jackson's character briefly plays the piano in a scene {{near the end of the}} episode, and it <b>is</b> <b>really</b> Jackson playing. The writers noted in the audio commentary that Jackson can actually play the piano, and that when he receives musical scenes, he learns the piece(s) beforehand to be able to play it for the scene.|$|E
5000|$|Coach K said: [...] I've said {{throughout}} the year they were good, then they <b>were</b> <b>really</b> good, then they <b>were</b> <b>really</b> good with great character. But I told them the championship game before we said a prayer, that: 'You are a great team.' ...|$|R

5|$|The {{rotation}} period of Makemake {{is estimated at}} 7.77 hours. Its lightcurve amplitude is small, only 0.03 mag. This {{was thought to be}} due to Makemake currently being viewed pole on from Earth; however, S/2015 (136472) 1's orbital plane (which is probably orbiting with little inclination relative to Makemake's equator due to tides resulting from its rapid rotation) is edge-on from Earth, implying that Makemake <b>is</b> <b>really</b> being viewed equator-on.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy <b>is</b> <b>really</b> the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole point}} is that we are the song. The self is coming from a state of pure awareness, from the state of being. All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of the {{physical}} world (including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song <b>is</b> <b>really</b> about transcending and {{about the quality of the}} transcendent.|$|E

50|$|Kazu {{is a man}} who indulges in {{daydream}} {{fantasies of}} sexual dalliances with women. As his fantasies become increasingly violent and even homicidal, neither he nor the film's audience is sure whether these <b>are</b> <b>really</b> harmless, if perverse, fantasies or if they <b>are</b> <b>really</b> happening.|$|R

5|$|A back-building thunderstorm, {{commonly}} referred to as a training thunderstorm, is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side (usually the west or southwest side in the Northern Hemisphere), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion. The storm <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a multi-cell storm with new, more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side, replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind. When this happens, catastrophic flooding is possible. In Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1972, an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area, resulting in devastating flash flooding. A similar event occurred in Boscastle, England, on 16 August 2004.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take {{up some of}} the limited space in working memory. The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low working memory capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low working memory looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working memory capacity. It could be argued that differences in performance between high- and low- working memory capacity individuals <b>is</b> <b>really</b> due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with working memory capacity in other studies.|$|E
5|$|Another bombshell is {{dropped in}} Dimitri's {{life when he}} finds out that Anton Lang, who he {{believed}} to be the son of two Marick family employees, <b>is</b> <b>really</b> his son with his maid, Corvina Lang (Margaret Sophie Stein). Dimitri had had a drunken one-night stand with Corvina which he had no memory of. Dimitri is happy to finally be a father, but Corvina convinces him not to tell Anton the truth right away. Dimitri attempts to forge relationship with Anton so it will ease the shock of the news. Nevertheless, Anton, who had believed Corvina was his sister, doesn't take the news of his parentage well and marries Kendall to throw it in Dimitri's face. Eventually, Anton sees Kendall for the manipulator that she is and divorces her. Anton and Dimitri manage to work things out before Anton leaves town.|$|E
2500|$|Without, sort of, {{having to}} organise it too much, {{we were all}} {{committed}} to the band {{to see how far}} it would go; and I think everyone <b>was</b> <b>really</b> happy with where it ended up taking us ... We were 17 when we started touring, um ... it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> awesome to <b>be</b> involved with a label like Murmur as well—Murmur had a lot of really cool bands on the roster; I mean, just getting invited to see a Silverchair gig, or something like that, <b>was</b> <b>really</b> exciting.|$|R
5000|$|I don't {{regret it}} at all because when I needed to <b>be</b> <b>really</b> focused, I <b>was</b> <b>really</b> focused. That's it. Both Presence and In Through the Out Door were only {{recorded}} in three weeks: that's really going some. You've got {{to be on top}} of it.|$|R
5000|$|I {{just thought}} it would <b>be</b> <b>really</b> {{interesting}} {{to take a look}} behind the curtain ... Who are these people? What do they want? What will they do to get it? I thought it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> fascinating and a great idea for the foundation of a story.|$|R
5|$|As Michael {{travels to}} Haddonfield, Laurie begins having {{hallucinations}} that mirror Michael's and also begin to include her acting out his murders. Meanwhile, Loomis goes on tour {{to promote his}} new book, only to be criticized by the public, who blame him for Michael's actions and for exploiting the deaths of Michael's victims. When Loomis' book is released, Laurie discovers that she <b>is</b> <b>really</b> Angel Myers, Michael's long-lost sister. She goes to a party with Mya (Brea Grant) and Harley (Angela Trimbur) to escape how she is feeling. Michael appears and kills Harley, then goes to the Brackett house and fatally wounds Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris). When Laurie and Mya arrive, Michael kills Mya and then comes after Laurie, who manages to escape. Laurie flags down a car, but Michael kills the driver and flips the car over with Laurie still inside. Michael then takes the unconscious Laurie to an abandoned shed.|$|E
5|$|At {{work one}} day, Esquire meets John Garnett (Keith David), a millionaire {{who heads a}} {{successful}} business venture called the United Express. The two quickly become friends, with Garnett's admiration for Esquire's ambition and Esquire's respect for Garnett's success driving the relationship. Esquire sees an opportunity to obtain the letter of recommendation that would bring about his acceptance to his primary college choice. When Esquire goes to Garnett's house {{to pick up the}} letter, he meets his daughter Erin, who, to his surprise, turns out to be New-New, whose real name is Erin. Erin says that she will reveal where Esquire <b>is</b> <b>really</b> from (something he lied to her father about) if he tells Rashad about her.|$|E
5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song <b>is</b> <b>really</b> tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E
