2500|$|When {{his army}} surrendered, Charles XII of Sweden {{and a few}} {{soldiers}} escaped to Ottoman territory, founding a colony in front of Bender, Moldova. Peter I demanded Charles's eviction, and when the sultan refused, Peter decided to force it by invading the Ottoman Empire. Peter's army was trapped by an Ottoman army at the Pruth river. Peter managed to negotiate a retreat, making a few territorial concessions and promising to withdraw his forces from the Holy Roman Empire as well as allowing Charles's return to Sweden. These terms were {{laid out in the}} Treaty of Adrianople (1713). Charles showed no interest in returning, established a provisional court in his colony, and sought to persuade the sultan to engage in an Ottoman-Swedish assault on Russia. The sultan {{put an end to the}} generous <b>hospitality</b> <b>granted</b> and had the king arrested in what became known as the [...] "kalabalik" [...] in 1713. Charles was then confined at Timurtash and Demotika; later he abandoned his hopes for an Ottoman front and returned to Sweden in a 14-day ride.|$|R

General Pope then {{commanded}} the district between the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers with headquarters at Mexico. Grant was assigned to command a sub-district embracing the troops of the immediate neighborhood. In regard to the <b>hospitality</b> which <b>Grant</b> mentions receiving in this secessionist district, we may note that the regiments before his accession to this command had visited houses without invitation and had helped themselves to food or had demanded it. Grant at once published orders forbidding soldiers to go into private houses unless invited, or to appropriate private property.] ...|$|R

50|$|We have {{no direct}} {{evidence}} for how early Celtic laws treated foreigners {{for most of}} the late prehistoric Celtic world. However, the already mentioned tesserae hospitales from Celtiberia, as well as the common practice in early European legal systems to consider, in principle, foreigners without a local host as without legal protection, we can assume that the same was the case in most if not all late prehistoric Celtic laws. While foreigners without local kin or a local host would thus have been 'fair game', it is likely that at least some members of late prehistoric Celtic polities were able to grant legal protection to foreigners (guests). This again would correspond well with the situation in early medieval Irish and Welsh law, where again cognate terminology exists for parallel practices of <b>granting</b> <b>hospitality</b> to foreigners. There is, of course, no evidence who actually could <b>grant</b> such <b>hospitality,</b> but it seems, if we go by the tesserae hospitales, that at least in Celtiberia this practice was not necessarily limited to ruling kin in larger polities, but was available at a relatively local level, which might indicate that, much like in early medieval Ireland and Wales, many members of any given polity were able to <b>grant</b> <b>hospitality.</b>|$|R
50|$|The king {{recalled}} La Vauguyon to Paris {{and sent}} him to Madrid again as ambassador. On 16 May 1790, Charles de Lameth complained that his negotiations were as important {{as those in the}} hands of La Vauguyon. Differences had arisen between England and Spain, whose cause may be attributed to La Vauguyon's negotiations by the British minister. He was replaced by Bourgoing on 1 June 1790 but continued to stay in Madrid. The Spanish king <b>granted</b> <b>hospitality</b> to La Vauguyon and his family, granting him properties during the Revolutionary storms and giving his son (the future general La Vauguyon, still a child) a post in the Spanish army.|$|R

He recorded his journey in a pamphlet published in June 1868 titled The Triumphal March of Sergeant Bates from Vicksburg to Washington. In an irony of the times, although {{he was allowed to}} raise his flag over numerous official buildings in the South, including the state Capitol in Richmond, he was not granted permission to fly it at the Capitol in Washington.|$|R
40|$|Owing to the {{assumption}} that belonging to acommunity means to bind the single migrant to the host community,and to determine the conditions for <b>granting</b> <b>hospitality,</b> support,services, and rights in general, traditional policies of integration areconcentrated on individual culture and subjective rights. In this article, I try to criticize traditional approaches to immigration andintegration, {{which are based on}} such a functional and individualistic perspective: on the contrary, I try to demonstrate that immigration has to be understood not only in relation to the individual migrants and their talents, but also to the relational system moving with them (families and communities). Only considering these relations and focusing on the problem of recognition, it is thus possible to realize that integrating means to recognize relational models. Recognitionis always connected to the identification, evaluation and regulation of practices shared by families, groups and communities livingtogether in the same society...|$|R

A squire announces Sir Brian de Bois Guilbert, of the Knights Templar, and Maurice de Bracy, a knight and advisor to Prince John, who {{are on their way to}} a Royal tournament at Ashby de la Zouche.

Cedric replies hotly that his ward will only marry a Saxon. Ivanhoe tells of a tournament he witnessed in the Holy Land where the English knights soundly defeated the Templars. Sir Brian was beaten by Ivanhoe, whom he wishes to challenge again. Rowena and the disguised Ivanhoe, whom no one recognises, assure Sir Brian that Ivanhoe will meet his challenge. After Rowena exits, Sir Brian and de Bracy agree that they will abduct her after the tournament at Ashby.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This note {{is devoted}} to Lusztig’s {{bijection}} between unipotent conjugacy classes in a simple complex algebraic group and 2 -sided cells in the affine Weyl group of the Langlands dual group; and also to {{the description of the}} reductive quotient of the centralizer of the unipotent element in terms of convolution of perverse sheaves on affine flag variety of the dual group conjectured by Lusztig in [L 4]. Our main tool is a recent construction by Beilinson, Gaitsgory and Kottwitz, the so-called sheaf-theoretic construction of the center of an affine Hecke algebra (see [Ga]). We show how this remarkable construction provides a geometric interpretation of the bijection, and allows to prove the conjecture. Acknowledgement. I am much indebted to Michael Finkelberg; among the many things he taught me are the theory of cells in Weyl groups and Lusztig’s conjecture (partially proved below). This note owes a lot to Dennis Gaitsgory, who explained to me the “sheaf-theoretic center ” construction, and made some helpful suggestions. I also thank Alexander Beilinson and Vladimir Drinfeld for useful comments, and Viktor Ostrik for stimulating interest. The results of this note were obtained (in a preliminary form) during the author’s participation in the special year on Geometric Methods in Representation Theory (98 / 99) at IAS; I thank IAS for its <b>hospitality,</b> and NSF <b>grant</b> for financial support...|$|R
