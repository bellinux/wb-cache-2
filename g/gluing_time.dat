50|$|Hide glue regains its working {{properties}} after cooling {{if it is}} reheated. This property can be {{used when}} the <b>glue's</b> open <b>time</b> does not allow the joint to be glued normally. For example, a cello maker {{may not be able}} to glue and clamp a top to the instrument's ribs in the short one-minute open time available. Instead, the builder will lay a bead of glue along the ribs, and allow it to cool. The top is then clamped to the ribs. Moving a few inches at a time, the maker inserts a heated palette knife into the joint, heating the glue. When the glue is liquefied, the palette knife is removed, and the glue cools, creating a bond. A similar process can be used to glue veneers to a substrate. The veneer and/or the substrate is coated with hot hide glue. Once the glue is cold, the veneer is positioned on the substrate. A hot object such as a clothes iron is applied to the veneer, liquefying the underlying glue. When the iron is removed, the glue cools, bonding the veneer to the substrate.|$|R

We present our initial experience with laparoendoscopic single-site surgery of partial adrenalectomy (LESS-PA) to treat aldosterone-producing adenomas. Case presentation A 60 -year-old woman was diagnosed with aldosterone-producing macroadenomas in the left adrenal and aldosterone-producing microadenomas in the right adrenal. A two-step operation was planned. The first step involved transumbilical LESS-PA for the left adrenal tumors. A multichannel port was inserted {{through the center of the}} umbilicus and the left adrenal gland was approached using bent instruments according to standard traditional laparoscopic procedures. The tumors were resected using an ultrasonic scalpel, and the resected site was coagulated using a vessel sealing instrument and then sealed with fibrin <b>glue.</b> Operative <b>time</b> was 123 minutes and blood loss was minimal. The patient was discharged from hospital within 72 hours. Her right adrenal microadenomas will be treated in the next several months. Conclusions Although our experience is limited, LESS-PA appears to be safe and feasible for treating aldosterone-producing adenomas. More cases and comparisons with the multiport technique are needed before drawing any definite conclusions concerning the technique. </p...|$|R
50|$|Hide glue {{is used in}} woodworking. It may be {{supplied}} as granules, flakes, or flat sheets, which have an indefinite shelf life if kept dry. It is dissolved in water, heated and applied warm, typically around 60°C (140°F). Warmer temperatures quickly destroy the strength of hide glue. Commercial glue pots, simple water baths or double boilers {{may be used to}} keep the glue hot while in use. As hide glue cools, it gels quickly. At room temperature, prepared hide glue has the consistency of stiff gelatin, which is in fact a similar composition. Gelled hide glue does not have significant strength, so it is vital to apply the glue, fit the pieces, and hold them steady before the glue temperature drops much below 50°C (120°F). All glues have an open time, the amount of <b>time</b> the <b>glue</b> remains liquid and workable. Joining parts after the open time is expired results in a weak bond. Hide <b>glue's</b> open <b>time</b> is usually a minute or less. In practice, this often means having to heat the pieces to be glued, and gluing in a very warm room, though these steps can be dispensed with if the glue and clamp operation can be carried out quickly.|$|R

Pre-dissolved WPI solution, PVP, sucrose, 1, 2 -propanediol (PG), sodium stearate, defoamer, and preservative were mixed and dissolved in water at 90 oC and then molded in push-up tubes. Chemical composition, functional properties (bonding strength, <b>glue</b> setting <b>time,</b> gel hardness, extension/retraction, and spreading properties), microstructure, and storage stability of the prototypes were evaluated in comparison with a commercial control. Results showed that all WPI/PVP prototypes had desirable bonding strength and exhibited faster setting than PVP prototypes and control. WPI could reduce gel hardness and form less compact and rougher structures than that of PVP, but there was no difference in bonding strength. PVP and sucrose could increase the hygroscopicity of glue sticks, thus increasing storage stability.

Methods: The research was conducted in November – December in 2005 after prior consent of the headmasters of these schools had been received provided {{that the results of}} the research would be presented. The research consisted of two parts: the questionnaire survey of pupils and qualitative research. First, an experimental questionnaire which was tested with one class was created and the final version was copied and given for students. The questionnaire was anonymous. The survey was conducted during a class hour {{with the help of the}} class teacher. The second part of the survey included an individual conversation with social educators. The conversation was half-structured; the social educators of both schools were asked the same questions. Results: In the comprehensive schools, almost 50 % of the pupils (55 % boys and 37 % girls) who participated in the research have smoked at least once in their lifetime. It shows that the smoking problem exists among young pupils. The questionnaire also showed that the pupils use alcohol; 3, 3 % pupils from J. Dobkevičius school use it every day and 3, 5 % pupils from Julijanava school use it every month. The pupils are acquainted with all kinds of drugs. 93, 3 % pupils from J. Dobkevičius school and 95, 5 % pupils from Julijanava school claimed that they never tried drugs. 2, 5 % pupils from both schools said that they have snuffed volatile substances (<b>glue)</b> 10 <b>times</b> and even more.

40|$|In {{atmospheric}} LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) remote sensing, {{the dynamic}} {{range of the}} return power signals can span up to five orders of magnitude. Modern acquisition systems such as those based on LicelTM transient recorders combine a dual acquisition mode in which the return signal is recorded simultaneously in both analog (analog-to-digital (AD) conversion) and photon-counting (PC) modes. Although both data records can be analyzed separately, their combination obtained through gluing gives {{the advantage of the}} high linearity of the AD conversion for high light-level signals (especially in the near range) and the high sensitivity of the PC mode for low light-level signals (in the far range). Recently, eruptions of volcanoes such as Eyjafjalla (Iceland) in 2010, Grímsvötn (Iceland Puyehue (Argentina) Nabro (Eritrea) and Mount Lokon (Indonesia) in 2011 have yielded emergency situations with a strong economical cost due to human evacuation and/or air traffic interruption. Volcanic aerosols are first injected in the troposphere and often reach the stratosphere where they can reside for several years. The mixed analog/photo-counting acquisition approach is particularly suitable for the detection of volcanic aerosols in both the troposphere (near/mid range) and the stratosphere (far range). In this line, a case study showing volcanic aerosols from the Nabro volcano (Eritrea, 2011) in the stratosphere and simultaneously Saharan dust in the troposphere over the multi-spectral Barcelona lidar station during the period 27 June – 1 July 2011 is presented. The benefits of the proposed gluing technique will be shown through the comparison of analog, PC, and <b>glued</b> backscatter-coefficient <b>time</b> series.

We describe a simple method of achieving conjunctival autograft adherence during pterygium surgery avoiding potential complications {{associated with the use}} of fibrin glue or sutures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After pterygium excision and fashioning of the autologous conjunctival graft, the recipient bed is encouraged to achieve natural hemostasis and relative desiccation before graft placement. Excessive hemorrhage in the graft bed is tamponed. Graft adherence and positioning is examined 12 – 15 min after surgery.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Acute {{renal failure}} in infants and small {{children}} is generally treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD). Dialysis {{has to be}} started immediately after catheter implantation. Early dialysate leakage can complicate the effectiveness of dialysis. Fibrin glue applied to the external part of the tunnel may stop dialysate leakage and {{eliminate the need for}} surgical intervention. The use of fibrin glue in the treatment of PD catheter leakage in children was studied. METHODS: Fibrin glue was used in 8 children (age 0. 8 - 57 months) on PD in whom dialysate leakage was seen during the first 24 to 48 hours after catheter insertion. The dialysis volume initially administered was 20 mL/kg body weight. Fibrin glue (1 mL) was applied to the external part of the subcutaneous catheter tunnel through the exit site, as close to the cuff as possible. The occurrence of dialysate leakage and complications such as exit-site or tunnel infection and peritonitis were evaluated. RESULTS: Nine single-cuff straight Tenckhoff catheters were implanted in 8 children. In 5 cases, no subcutaneous tunnel was created. One child had catheter replacement due to obstruction of the catheter; on both occasions, catheter leakage was seen and treated with fibrin glue. In all 8 patients, no relapse of dialysate leakage was seen after application of the fibrin <b>glue.</b> During the <b>time</b> of PD, exit-site infections, tunnel infections, and peritonitis did not occur. CONCLUSION: Fibrin glue is a successful, simple, and safe substance for the treatment of peritoneal dialysate leakage in infants and small children with acute renal failure treated with PD...|$|R
40|$|Lightweight timber {{structures}} {{have many}} advantages, but high-demand acoustic quality {{is hard to}} achieve due to the relatively poor insulation through the junctions, especially in the low frequency range (20 Hz- 200 Hz) where the weight (mass per unit of area) of a construction is an important parameter for the air-borne insulation properties. Increasing the mass would improve the insulation but this would go against the main advantage of lightweight constructions. Impact sound from a walking person {{is the most common}} sound insulation problem for these kinds of structures, where the footsteps produce a high-degree of noise disturbance. The aim of this particular investigation, however, is to show how glue modifies the sound transmission through the joints in a wooden floor. Theory shows that coupling occurs in a joint either along a line or at individual points depending on the distance between the screws or nails with regard to the bending wavelength. When a viscous elastic material as glue is inserted in between the parts of the joint, the behavior will change and it is therefore important to be studied. To achieve this aim, two structures were built. The first one constituted of two squared plates of dimension 0. 6 m x 0. 6 m, each one of them fixed onto one beam 4. 5 m wide and 22 cm high, by means of equidistant screws. A second set-up was built too, but this time only a single 1. 2 m x 0. 6 m plate was fixed onto the beam. The same structures were built again a second time, but this <b>time</b> <b>glue</b> was applied around the screws on the contact surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Monte Carlo {{simulations}} of a two-dimensional depth-averaged distributed bed-roughness flow model, TELEMAC- 2 D, {{are used to}} model a detailed tracer dispersion test in a complex reach of the River Severn in the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (<b>GLUE)</b> framework. A <b>time</b> efficient, zero equation, spatially distributed eddy viscosity model is derived from physical reasoning and used to close the flow equations. It is shown to have the property of low numerical diffusion, avoiding recourse to a globally large value of the eddy viscosity. For models of complex river flows, there are typically so many degrees of freedom in the specification of distributed parameters owing to the limitations of field data collection, that the identification of a unique model structure is unlikely. The data used here to constrain the model structure come from a continuous tracer injection experiment, comprising six spatially distributed time series of concentration measurements. Several hundred Monte-Carlo {{simulations of}} different model structures were investigated and {{it was found that}} multiple model structures produced feasible simulations of the tracer mixing, giving rise to the phenomenon of equifinality. Rather than optimizing the model structure {{on the basis of the}} constraining data, we derive relative possibility measures that express our relative degree of belief in each model structure. These measures can then be used as weights for assessing predictive uncertainty when using a range of model structures, to estimate the flow distribution under varying stages, or for providing maps indicating fully distributed confidence limits in the risk assessments process. Such an approach is used here, and helps to identify the circumstances under which two-dimensional modelling can be useful. The framework is not limited to the model structures that are developed herein, and more advanced process representation techniques can be included as computational efficiency increases...|$|R
40|$|We now {{survive in}} a risk society {{especially}} {{when we look at}} the type of food that is consumed together with the fact that children and adolescents are inactive in most of the times is an issue that can be averted by promoting exercise and activity in the group. Computers, TV, cell phones, and computer video games are currently integral to the daily lives of our students. On the other hand, obesity has been an issue that has been lately affecting children and adolescents who spend most of their <b>time</b> <b>glued</b> to these gadgets which encourage inactivity. Straker and Abbott (2007) commented on the consequences caused by technology such as TV, computers, video games, smart phones which they said promoted sedentary lifestyles, poor physical and mental health, obesity in children and adolescents and cardiac diseases in children. There are several ways that have been employed to try and fight childhood and adolescent obesity in various aspects and this has been done due to introducing relevant technology that promotes activity. Technology has been in use in physical education for example; use of heart rate monitors, pedometers and video analysis of games. Use of information technology in teaching physical education can be of much help in physical activity if it also considers activity based technology. Use of technology should not be however looked at as a substitute to replace physical activity or physical education teachers. Technology and exergames have been noted for their ability to encourage participation in Physical Education (PE). Tracking personal progress provides a mechanism for students to become cognitively involved with their fitness through a process of critical reflection. Implications of introducing exergames which are new active video games to the school curriculum can be considered in the wake of information technology. Perhaps it is also prudent to look at how these games can be used as part of the Zimbabwean PE school curriculum...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring {{the healing}} of long bones has been studied {{extensively}} to reduce the period of encumbrance and unnecessary pain for patients suffering from fractured bones. This is more critical for fractures in the pelvis as the patients can be bedridden {{for long periods of}} time to allow proper healing to take place. Patients who suffer from unstable pelvic fractures are usually implanted with internal fixations which provide structural rigidity as well as allow sufficient contact between fracture edges for healing to occur. However this does not provide enough strength to support weight-bearing activities. A 12 week post-operative period of immobility is typically enforced on the patient to ensure this healing process is not hindered. This period of immobility could result in muscle atrophy and may cause more health complications for the elderly. At this point in time, there are no proper ways to evaluate the strength of the healing fracture of a pelvis or guidelines to mobilise patients with unstable pelvic fractures. It is therefore highly beneficial to develop a non-invasive method which can be used in-situ to monitor {{the healing of}} the pelvis in hopes of allowing patients to undertake earlier weight bearing activities and reduce muscle degradation. Current methods employed to monitor long bone healing are insufficient for applications in the pelvis as the human pelvis has a significantly complicated geometry which demands a different approach. This thesis reviews the different methods which have been used and are currently being used to monitor healing in bone, ultimately proposing the use of vibration analysis techniques as previous studies and vibration theory have shown promising results. Vibration analysis methods are able to assess the strength and integrity of a structure globally, which may be able to provide in-situ monitoring of fracture healing in a human pelvis. By relating the dynamic behaviour of a healing pelvis to its integrity, this method can be incorporated to a quantitative and non-invasive monitoring system. This thesis tests the vibration analysis methods using experimental as well as finite element methods. Experimental tests were conducted on 4 th generation synthetic pelvises instrumented with an array of PZT sensors. A constraining rig was developed to support the pelvis such that it accurately represents constrains of the pelvis in-vivo. The synthetic pelvis was cut at the sacrum to simulate a fractured pelvis followed by the application of araldite epoxy to simulate healing by allowing the epoxy to cure. Excitation signals were introduced to the synthetic structure using both impact excitation as well as shaker excitation with the fixation pins as wave guides. Measurements were collected from the sensor array over the curing period to obtain the response functions. A comparison of the response functions against time allowed for the araldite to cure demonstrates significant changes in frequency as well as amplitude of resonant features over the stiffness recovery period. These changes were eventually quantified by calculating stiffness restoration parameters using the response functions, using the response of the pelvis in its cut state as a baseline. The parameters were found to be directly proportional to the <b>glue</b> curing <b>time,</b> where the recovery parameter increases with increasing curing time. This study however, was incomplete as the recovery index was not related to an absolute parameter of strength or integrity of the pelvis. Vibration analysis methods were also initially proposed due to their potential of detecting sub-surface fractures and non-uniform healing. Additional experiments were conducted to test the reliability as well as sensitivity of this method for detecting non-uniform or partial healing in a pelvis. Findings from the secondary experiments were able to conclude that vibration analysis techniques were sensitive enough to detect the partial healing. The recovery parameters calculated from partial healing experiments were almost consistently lower than those calculated from initial tests. To solve the problem of relating these stiffness recovery indices to an absolute parameter of strength however required the use of finite element methods. A pelvis with a Dennis I fracture was modelled with its stiffness and density of bone around the fracture site varied to simulate stiffness restoration which occurs during healing. Up to 50 mode shapes for each healing state were computed to obtain a response within a frequency range comparable to those obtained experimentally. The frequency response functions were extracted from different locations around the pelvis and fixation for analysis and were later compared to results obtained from experiments. The responses seem to reflect dynamic changes which are proportional to the changes in stiffness and density of the bone properties at the fracture site. It was also found that certain resonant features which were driven by the fixation were very prominent in both FE as well as experiments in addition to being sensitive to stiffness changes at the fracture. This finding was very promising as it could allow the monitoring system to interrogate the health of the pelvis without direct attachment to the pelvis. For completion of this research, a final study was done via FE to create a more realistic healing model of the pelvis. This independent study shows results which reflect findings obtained both experimentally and numerically. The dynamic responses obtained from this model were shown to vary proportionally to improving stiffness at the fracture...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of a bigger project, ORTO - roughly {{translated}} to optimized resource efficient manufacturing of orthoses. During the manufacturing of orthopedic aids many different methods are used to manufacture individually adjusted products. Processes, methods and material may vary depending on what end product is going to be produced. The knowledge of how the manufacturing affects the employees long term is not complete from a health-oriented perspective. The purpose of this thesis is to map out the manufacturing processes for rigid and hinged molded ankle-foot orthoses made primarily from carbon fibre composite. This will then be used to identify the potential sources of exposure of hazardous materials that can lead to health issues. To answer the problem statements theory about process mapping has been gathered and observations in the shape of video recordings have been done at Borås Orthotics to map out the current situation, in addition to interviews. The purpose of the process mapping was also to identify potential sources of emission where exposure to hazardous materials was evident. Theory and research about these materials has been gathered about the potential health issues. The exposure times from the sources of emissions has been compiled from the video recordings, where it was deemed to be four possible sources, in the form of dry carbon fibre bands, casting with poly methyl methacrylate, sanding and <b>gluing.</b> The exposure <b>times</b> and the sources of emission has been analyzed and compared with theory and research to investigate if there was any possible health hazards. The discussion has most importantly been about how the manufacturing of hazardous materials can affect the employees in terms of health and how the exposure times can be reduced. The conclusion is that certain sources of emissions run a greater risk to affect the employees negatively and certain measures might be in order to in terms of changing how the work is performed. It might be worth some reconstruction to make the work place safer in addition to reviewing certain methods. In general the regulations are a good idea to abide by since they are intended to prevent exposure for employees that work materials such as carbon fibers. Other practical suggestions of how to reduce the exposure to hazardous materials are included. An example of this could be to install a mirror solution in the fume cupboard at the casting process or to look at the routines and the work methods applied at the sanding process. The regulations should also be compared to how the work is currently performed and applied according to the work environment regulations. Examensarbetet är en del i ett större projekt, ORTO - Optimerad Resurseffektiv Tillverkning av Ortoser. Vid tillverkning av ortopedtekniska hjälpmedel används idag många olika metoder för att tillverka individanpassade produkter. Processer, metoder och material kan variera beroende på vilken slutprodukt det är som ska tillverkas. Det finns ingen fullständig kunskap om hur detta påverkar personalen som tillverkar hjälpmedlen och användare på lång sikt ur ett hälsomässigt perspektiv. Syftet med arbetet var att kartlägga tillverkningsprocesserna för ledade och oledade gjutna ankel-fot-ortoser som är gjorda framförallt av kolfiberkompositmaterial, för att identifiera exponeringen av farliga material och ämnen som kan leda till eventuella hälsoproblem. För att besvara frågeställningarna har teori om processkartläggning samlats in och observationer i form av videoinspelningar och intervjuer har utförts på Borås Ortopedteknik för att kartlägga nuläget. Processkartläggningen syfte var också att identifiera potentiella emissionskällor där exponering för farligt material förekom. Teori och forskning om dessa material har samlats in om dess potentiella hälsopåverkan. Exponeringstiderna vid emissionskällorna har sammanställts genom videoinspelningarna, där det i nuläget bedömdes finnas fyra stycken emissionskällor i form av torra kolfiberband, gjutning med polymetylmetakrylat, slipning och limning. Exponeringstiderna och emissionskällorna har analyserats och jämförts med teori och forskning för att granska om det var någon hälsorisk. Diskussionen har framförallt handlat om hur bearbetningen av farliga material kan komma att påverka personalen som tillverkar hjälpmedlen hälsomässigt och hur exponeringstiderna kan reduceras. Slutsatsen är att vissa emissionskällor löper större risk att påverka personalen negativt och åtgärder i form av nya arbetssätt och metoder eller ombyggnationer kan vara av värde att analysera vidare. Även förebyggande åtgärder som att följa föreskrifter skulle vara aktuellt för att minska exponeringen av farliga material. Praktiska förslag ges på vad som skulle kunna förändras. Exempel på detta kan vara att installera en spegellösning i dragskåpet vid gjutningen eller att se över rutiner och arbetssätt vid slipningen och att följa föreskrifterna från arbetsmiljöverket...|$|R
