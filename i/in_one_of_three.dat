5|$|Administered by the International Baccalaureate (IB), the IBDP {{is taught}} in schools in over 140 countries, <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> languages: English, French, or Spanish. In order to participate, {{students}} must attend an IB school. IBDP students complete assessments in six subjects, one from each subject group, and three core requirements. Students are evaluated using {{both internal and external}} assessments, and courses finish with an externally assessed series of examinations, usually consisting of two or three timed written tests. Internal assessment varies by subject: there may be oral presentations, practical work, or written work. In most cases, these are initially graded by the classroom teacher, whose grades are then verified or modified, as necessary, by an appointed external moderator.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Han dynasty, every male commoner aged twenty-three was liable for conscription into the military. The minimum age for the military draft was reduced to twenty after Emperor Zhao's (r.87–74 BC) reign. Conscripted soldiers underwent one year of training and one year of service as non-professional soldiers. The year of training was served <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> branches of the armed forces: infantry, cavalry or navy. The year of active service was served either on the frontier, in a king's court or under the Minister of the Guards in the capital. A small professional (paid) standing army was stationed near the capital.|$|E

Fielder's choice is primarily discussed in rules 10.05 and 10.06, and it generally occurs when it is judged that a batter-runner would have been put out had the defense chosen to do so.|$|E
5|$|Initial reports {{suggested}} that the women would serve their sentence <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> provinces. The decision upon a general-security women's corrective labor colony (the {{most common type of}} prison in Russia) in the Republic of Mordovia, approximately 400 kilometers from Moscow, was later confirmed by Tolokonnikova's husband. The women asked authorities to let them serve their sentence at the pre-trial detention facility in Moscow. Their request was denied, and Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina were then dispatched to penal colonies in Mordovia and Perm Oblast, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Players {{can play}} a more {{aggressive}} run-and-gun game by using gadgets and weapons to eliminate enemies. They can interact with environmental objects, such as ledges and zip-lines, to navigate levels. Conviction mark-and-execute system returns in Blacklist, with refinements and additions to allow players to mark several targets. When they attack, they can kill all marked targets instantly. Improvements made the system work more fluidly. A variety of enemies (including soldiers and dogs) are encountered in the game, following the protagonist and alerting their companions. Players {{have the option to}} kill them, leave them untouched, or incapacitate them, and the game classifies their choices <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> categories: Ghost (stealthy play), Panther (stealthy, aggressive play), and Assault (aggressive play).|$|E

Each player chooses one of the available charactersShadow, two metallic versions of him, and palette-swapped variants of each. The combatants attack each other and steal each other's rings until all but one are eliminated. Additionally, in single-player mode, a second player may take control of Shadow's sidekick character in some stages.|$|E
5|$|During the 1996 season, the Orange Bowl was {{a member}} of the Bowl Alliance, a {{precursor}} to the modern Bowl Championship Series. The Bowl Alliance was formed prior to the 1995 college football season in an effort to match the No. 1 and No. 2 teams at the conclusion of the regular season while also ensuring other high-ranking teams were allowed to participate in high-profile bowl games. The Alliance included the Southeastern Conference, Big 12 Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, and Big East Conference. As agreed, the champions of each conference would play <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> Bowl Alliance games: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl. The Big Ten and Pac-10 conferences, which had a separate agreement with the Rose Bowl, were not included in the Bowl Alliance until 1998, when the Alliance became the Bowl Championship Series.|$|E
5|$|During the Western Han, farming peasants {{formed the}} {{majority}} of those who were conscripted by the government to perform corvée labor or military duties. For the labor service (gengzu 更卒), males aged fifteen to fifty-six would be drafted for one month out of the year to work on construction projects and perform other duties in their commanderies and counties. For the military obligation (zhengzu 正卒), all males aged twenty-three were to train for one year <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> branches of the military: infantry, cavalry, or navy. Until they reached age fifty-six, they were liable to perform one year of active service as troops sent to guard the frontiers from hostile nomads or to act as guards in the capital city. Significant changes were made to this system during Eastern Han; a commuting tax could be paid by peasants if they wanted to avoid the one-month labor obligation, since hired labor became more popular in construction and other projects. The military service obligation could even be avoided if a peasant paid a commuting tax, since the Eastern Han military became largely a volunteer force. Other commoners such as merchants were also able to join the army.|$|E

5|$|Geologists have dated and {{documented}} dozens of major eruptions over the volcano's long history, bridging the long gap between Kīlauea's oldest known rock and only extremely recent written records and historical observation. Historical lava {{flows from the}} volcano are generally recovered by scientists <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> ways. The oldest flows, dating back 275,000 to 225,000 years, have been recovered from Kīlauea's submerged southern slope by ship-towed remotely operated vehicles. These lavas exhibit forms characteristic of early, submerged preshield-stage eruptive episodes, from when the volcano was still a rising seamount {{that had not yet}} breached the ocean surface, and their surface exposure is unusual, as in most other volcanoes such lavas would have since been buried by more recent flows.|$|E
5|$|McLeod {{recovered}} from her second ACL injury quickly {{and was on}} the 24-player roster that competed in Chongqing, China at the Four Nations Tournament in late January 2011. She appeared <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> matches against China on January 21. After the Four Nations tournament, the Canadian national team convened for their traditional residency program in preparation for the FIFA Women's World Cup. The team trained in Italy from February 12–22 preceding the Cyprus Cup. McLeod appeared in three of the four matches in the Cyprus Cup, recording two shutouts. Following the tournament, the Canadian team took a break, during which McLeod hosted Special Goalkeeper Training Sessions from March 17–18. The team reconvened for a four-week training camp from March 23 – April 20 in Roma, Italy to prepare for the FIFA Women's World Cup. During the camp, McLeod appeared in three friendlies and recorded two shutouts.|$|E
5|$|Morrowind {{begins with}} the player's character, having been imprisoned, {{arriving}} in Morrowind by boat {{in order to be}} pardoned. This is a common introductory segment throughout the main installments of the series. A tutorial depicting the prisoner's release moves the player through the process of character creation. The player is successively asked questions by a fellow prisoner, an officer, and a bureaucrat as the player is registered as a free citizen; choosing, in the process, the player character's name, race, gender, class, and birthsign. These affect the player's starting attributes, skills, and abilities. The player then determines their class <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> ways; Picking from a class list, randomly generating a class via questions, or creating a custom class themselves.|$|E

5|$|The genetic {{heritability}} of Alzheimer's disease (and memory components thereof), {{based on}} reviews of twin and family studies, ranges from 49% to 79%. Around 0.1% {{of the cases}} are familial forms of autosomal (not sex-linked) dominant inheritance, which have an onset before age 65. This form of the disease is known as early onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Most of autosomal dominant familial AD {{can be attributed to}} mutations <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> genes: those encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins 1 and 2. Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a small protein called Aβ42, which is the main component of senile plaques. Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between Aβ42 and the other major forms—particularly Aβ40—without increasing Aβ42 levels.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} {{the age of}} twenty-three, male commoners became eligible for conscription into the armed forces (zhengzu 正卒) for one year of training and one year of service; the year of service could be served {{until the age of}} fifty-six. Conscripts were trained, and would serve <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> branches of the military: infantry, cavalry, or naval marine. The year of service could take the form of soldiering at frontier garrisons protecting the borders against nomadic enemies, serving as guards in the courts of kings or as guards under the Minister of the Guards in the capital. By 155 BC, the minimum age for conscription was lowered to twenty. During Emperor Zhao of Han's (r. 87–74 BC) reign, the minimum age was raised to twenty-three, but after his reign it was once again reduced to twenty.|$|E
