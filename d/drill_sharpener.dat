5000|$|In 1973 Darex {{was founded}} by Richard Bernard in Beecher, Illinois. David, Arthur and Richard Bernard founded the company and their {{initials}} make up the first three letters of “Darex”. While at Bernard Welding Equipment Co., Arthur and Richard saw {{how difficult it was}} to sharpen drill bits. Richard brought his father, Arthur, into the business to help develop a <b>drill</b> <b>sharpener.</b> At a 1976 Cleveland regional trade show, Darex released their first drill bit sharpener, the M-1. In 1978 Darex moved to Ashland, Oregon.|$|E
50|$|In 1946, in {{the wake}} of World War II, the Golden Gate, Reform, Black Cat Amalgamated, Golden Casket, Wasp and Black and White mines were reopened. Joseph Fisher and Sons {{constructed}} a road from Portland Roads to Wenlock, which necessitated seven bridges. Sheds and huts were erected and machinery was installed at the mines. At the Black Cat Amalgamated mine a Marshall portable steam engine, a rock <b>drill</b> <b>sharpener,</b> air compressor, air hoist, Blake steam duplex pump and a Worthington steam duplex pump were installed in the re-equipping of the mines.|$|E

50|$|In 2004 Drill Doctor {{sold its}} one-millionth unit and Darex was {{named one of}} Oregon's top 50 places {{to work for the}} third year in a row. In 2013, and 2014 Darex was again named as one of Oregon's top workplace. In 2006 Darex secured a {{contract}} from the US Army for a <b>drill</b> bit <b>sharpener</b> that would be included in tool kits to support soldier’s safety. Darex developed the V390 <b>drill</b> bit <b>sharpener</b> that was used in Iraq by soldiers to repair the armor plating on Humvees and install antennas for GPS units.|$|R
5000|$|Darex L.L.C. is an American {{manufacturer}} of industrial bit sharpeners, and are currently based in Ashland, Oregon. Darex L.L.C. owns two other brands, Work Sharp Tools which creates knife and tool <b>sharpeners</b> and <b>Drill</b> Doctor which creates hobbyist <b>drill</b> bit <b>sharpeners.</b> Darex is a fourth generation family owned company {{that began in}} 1973 in Beecher, Illinois until 1979 when it relocated to Ashland.|$|R
5000|$|After {{several years}} of {{manufacturing}} <b>drill</b> bit <b>sharpeners</b> for industrial customers, Darex created a line of endmill sharpeners. In 1988 Darex released the E80, E85, and E90. With the success of industrial sharpeners, Darex decided {{to create a new}} consumer brand, Drill Doctor, which debuted in 1996 at the International Hardware Show in Chicago, Illinois. Both the DD500 and DD750 were launched.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} design and {{development}} of the drill bit sharpening jigs for bench grinder. The objective of this thesis is to design the <b>drill</b> bit <b>sharpener</b> jig that enhance the better outcome rather than manual sharpening operation. The thesis follows with the development of the drill bit sharpening jig that can be attached to the bench grinder. The structural three-dimensional solid modeling of drill bit sharpening jig was developed using the computer-aided drawing software which is CATIA V 5 R 21. The strategy of validation of the model design was developed. The generative part structural analysis was then performed using simulation in CATIA V 5 R 21 to detect the Von Mises distribution. The design and suitable material will be validated. The fabrication of the jig may undergoes in various machining process such as milling, turning, electrical discharge wirecut and grinding. The assembled part shall be tested on the bench grinder. Besides, several dull drill bits will be sharpen using the jig. These assessment results are significant to improve the component design at the early developing stage. Further analysis will be conducted by testing the drilling process on the workpiece. The resharpen drill bits and the new drill bits will results on the difference surface roughness. Thus, the surface roughness analysis is performed to distinguish hole surface roughness outcomes for both drill bits. The results shows the difference of surface roughness between both hole surface is small and insignificant. Thus, it means that the outcomes is relatively same. The jig can also significantly reduce the cost and time to market, and improve product reliability and customer confidence...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{examines the}} occupational health {{problems associated with}} the use of vibrating tools (including both hand-held vibrating tools and stationary tools that transmit vibration through a workpiece), and it provides criteria for reducing the risk of developing vibration-induced health problems. The major health {{problems associated with the}} use of vibrating tools are signs and symptoms of peripheral vascular and peripheral neural disorders of the fingers and hands. These signs and symptoms include numbness, pain, and blanching of the fingers. This composite of vibration-induced signs and symptoms is referred to as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS), sometimes called Raynaud's phenomenon of occupational origin, or vibration white finger disease. In the United States, an estimated 1. 45 million workers use vibrating tools. The prevalence of HAVS in a worker population that has used vibrating tools ranges from 6 % to 100 %, with an average of about 50 %. The development of HAVS depends on many factors, including the level of acceleration (vibration energy) produced by the tool, the length of time the tool is used each day, the cumulative number of months or years the worker has used the tool, and the ergonomics of tool use. The tools most commonly associated with HAVS are powered hammers, chisels, chainsaws, sanders, grinders, riveters, breakers, <b>drills,</b> compactors, <b>sharpeners,</b> and shapers. The prevalence and severity of HAVS usually increase as the acceleration level and duration of use increase. HAVS is a chronic, progressive disorder with a latency period that may vary from a few months to several years. The early stages of HAVS are usually reversible if further exposure to vibration is reduced or eliminated; but treatment is usually ineffective for the advanced stages of HAVS, and the disorder may progress to loss of effective hand function and necrosis of the fingers. Prevention is therefore critical. Adherence to the exposure controls recommended in this document should prevent or greatly reduce the potential for vibration-exposed workers to develop HAVS.
