50|$|Square steel nuts {{were common}} on {{machinery}} {{of the late}} 19th through mid 20th century. Today hex nuts have displaced them. One reason is that a <b>hex</b> <b>nut</b> offers a new wrenching access at every 60°, whereas a square nut offers one only at every 90°.|$|E
50|$|Originally, the {{connector}} {{was designed}} to carry signals at frequencies up to 1 GHz in military applications, but today's common Type N easily handles frequencies up to 11 GHz. More recent precision enhancements to the design by Julius Botka at Hewlett Packard have pushed this to 18 GHz. The male connector is hand-tightened (though versions with a <b>hex</b> <b>nut</b> are also available) and has an air gap between the center and outer conductors. The coupling has a 5/8-24 thread. The center coaxial contacts are identical to TNC and BNC connectors. Amphenol suggests tightening to a torque of 15 inlb Nm, while Andrew Corporation suggest 20 inlb Nm for their <b>hex</b> <b>nut</b> variant. As torque limit depends only on thread quality and cleanliness, whereas the main operational requirement is good RF contact without significant steps or gaps, these values {{should be seen as}} indicative rather than critical.|$|E
40|$|Heavy <b>hex</b> <b>nuts</b> may be {{selected}} with similar hardness to the studs to avoid stripping of nut threads for pressure containing (closure bolting) and primary load bearing bolting. However, industry specification for subsea production systems, e. g. such as API Specifications 6 A, 16 A, 16 C, and 17 D, allows {{the use of}} low strength heavy <b>hex</b> <b>nuts,</b> e. g. ASTM A 194 Grade 2 HM or 7 M, to be applied together with high strength studs, e. g. ASTM A 320 Grades L 43 or L 7. In the refining and chemical industries the common practice is to use ASTM A 193 B 7 studs with 2 H nuts. Calculations and testing of nuts have been performed and capacity formulas have been established for nut structural capacities. Guidance is given on selecting nut strength/hardness to avoid stripping of nut threads. ASTM specifications give minimum quality requirements during manufacture. A brief review of standard quality requirements is given and guidance for additional requirements for high integrity fasteners {{in order to have}} equivalent quality as pressure containing forgings is given.

50|$|A {{square nut}} is a four-sided nut. Compared to {{standard}} <b>hex</b> <b>nuts,</b> square nuts {{have a greater}} surface {{in contact with the}} part being fastened, and therefore provide greater resistance to loosening (though also greater resistance to tightening). They are also much less likely to become rounded-off after repeated loosening/tightening cycles. Square nuts are typically mated with square-headed bolts. Square nuts are used along with flat washers in order to avoid damage from its sharp edges and helps to increase the strength of the fastener. Square nuts can have standard, fine or coarse threading with platings of zinc yellow, plain, zinc clear, tin and cadmium, among others. Most can meet either the ASTM A194, ASTM A563, or ASTM F594 standard.|$|R

Variation in total mass loss (TML) values for heat shrink tubing were correlated with location. Nylon grommets were evaluated for mechanical integrity; slight embrittlement was observed for flight specimens. Multi-layer insulation blankets, wire bundles, and paints in non-exposed interior locations were all in visibly good condition.

5000|$|GA {{split beam}} nut, {{also known as}} a split <b>hex</b> <b>nut</b> or slotted beam nut, is a locknut with slots cut in the top that {{separate}} the outside end into two or more sections that are bent slightly inward, making the thread diameter undersized in the slotted portion. As the nut is threaded on, these sections are forced back out to their original position and increase the friction between the nut and the fastener, creating the locking action.|$|E
50|$|Cleco-type {{fasteners}} {{are also}} available with a threaded mechanism to draw the spreader bar up. Clecos of this type take more time to install and remove, but can be made much tighter than the spring-type clecos. They are commonly available with a wingnut for hand tightening, or with a simple <b>hex</b> <b>nut</b> {{so that they may}} be spaced more closely together. In either case they will usually have a hexagonal body that may be better gripped to tighten or release the spreader bar.|$|E

This is to prevent contact with the external thread to protect the threads or protect other things the threads would rub against. In addition the dome gives a more finished appearance. It is usually made of brass, steel, stainless steel (low carbon content) or nylon. It can also be chrome plated and given a mirror finish.|$|E

50|$|SMC (SubMiniature version C) {{connectors}} are coaxial RF connectors {{developed in}} the 1960s. They use a #10-32 UNF threaded interface (screw type). They offer excellent electrical performance from DC to 10 GHz. Female (a.k.a. plug) SMC connectors have a socket for the center contact, and male (a.k.a. jack) SMC connectors have a pin for the center contact. SMC jack connectors have an external thread while SMC plug connectors have the mating <b>hex</b> <b>nut.</b> Available in 50-Ohm and 75-Ohm characteristic impedance, they provide an interconnect means for small form factor coaxial cables (e.g. 50-Ohm RG-174, 75-Ohm RG-179) and printed circuit boards where small footprint is important.|$|E
5000|$|In 1961, an {{optional}} locking mechanism consisting of an outer <b>hex</b> <b>nut</b> encasing a captured threaded barrel {{was added to}} the 874 line. [...] It {{can be seen in the}} photograph of a GR-900 to GR-874 adapter,. The locking assembly is not captive and can be backed off the RF connector. The threaded barrel is supplied on each connector. The threaded barrel was withdrawn into the nut on one connector and extended on the other to allow the barrel to engage the nut of both mating connectors. This style of locking mechanism was continued in GR-874's thematic successors; the GR-900 precision 14 mm connector that retains a crenelated hermaphroditic mechanical anti-spin feature to protect the sexless RF interface from rotating and galling when the locking mechanism is tightened, and the fully sexless APC-7 7 mm connector.|$|E
50|$|The {{truss rod}} is a thin, strong metal rod that {{runs along the}} inside of the neck. It is used to correct changes to the neck's {{curvature}} caused by aging of the neck timbers, changes in humidity, or to compensate for changes in the tension of strings. The tension of the rod and neck assembly is adjusted by a <b>hex</b> <b>nut</b> or an allen-key bolt on the rod, usually located either at the headstock, sometimes under a cover, or just inside the body of the guitar underneath the fretboard and accessible through the sound hole. Some truss rods can only be accessed by removing the neck. The truss rod counteracts the immense amount of tension the strings place on the neck, bringing the neck back to a straighter position. Turning the truss rod clockwise tightens it, counteracting the tension of the strings and straightening the neck or creating a backward bow. Turning the truss rod counter-clockwise loosens it, allowing string tension to act on the neck and creating a forward bow.|$|E
5000|$|Reppy {{was among}} the first climbers in the United States to {{practice}} so-called [...] "clean climbing" [...] techniques, which he learned in England. While most climbers of the day were hammering their way up the cliffs with pitons, Reppy helped introduce the use of nuts, which at the time consisted of <b>hex</b> <b>nuts</b> from truck wheels, strung with nylon webbing. Unlike pitons, nuts are placed and removed without the use of hammers and save the rock from permanent damage. The technique often makes placements easier and faster to achieve, and thus may make difficult climbs easier to complete. Many advances in rock climbing were made possible by this method. Among a substantial number of others deserving credit for this trend in the U.S. are Yvon Chouinard and John Stannard.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of electrocoagulation using iron electrodes {{for the treatment}} of aqueous solutions containing chromium hexavalent ions using fixed bed electrochemical batch reactor was studied. A new anode design consisting of <b>hex</b> <b>nuts</b> was connected together with a thin rode of iron. The helical shape in the nuts increases the anode surface area allowing high chromium removal rate within very short coagulation time. The effect of different parameters affecting the electrocoagulation process, such as initial hexavalent chromium concentration, applied current, electrolyte type [sodium chloride and sodium sulfate] concentration and initial pH of the solution was investigated. The optimum conditions for the EC process by using the present cell based on minimum initial hexavalent chromium concentration, energy consumption and operating cost were 100 mg of Cr(VI) /l, 0. 55 A, 1. 5 g of sodium chloride/land pH of 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{pipe wrench}} (US), Stillson wrench or Stillsons (UK) is an {{adjustable}} wrench/spanner used for turning soft iron {{pipes and fittings}} with a rounded surface. The design of the adjustable jaw allows it to lock in the frame, such that any forward pressure on the handle tends to pull the jaws tighter together. Teeth angled {{in the direction of}} turn dig into the soft pipe. They are not intended for use on hardened steel hex nuts or other fittings because they would ruin the head; however, if a <b>hex</b> <b>nut</b> is soft enough that it becomes rounded beyond use with standard wrenches, a pipe wrench is sometimes used to break the bolt or nut free. Pipe wrenches are usually sold in the following sizes (by length of handle): 10, 12, 14, 18, 24, 36, and 48 inches, although smaller and larger sizes are available as well. They are usually made of cast steel. Today, aluminium is also used to construct the body of the wrench, while the teeth and jaw remain steel. Teeth, and jaw kits (which also contain adjustment rings and springs) can be bought to repair broken wrenches, as this is cheaper than buying a new wrench.|$|E
40|$|A new {{low-cost}} {{flow meter}} {{is being used}} to measure flows in the discharge pipelines from wells located on the Elephant Butte Irrigation District (EBID) near Las Cruces, New Mexico. The flow meter, called the Mag-tube, is a straightforward application of the Pitot tube concept. Two prototypes of the new flow meter were recently calibrated in the hydraulics laboratory of the Bureau of Reclamation. The meters are adaptable to a range of pipe sizes. Meter Description A prototype Mag-tube flow meter is shown in Figure 1. The meter consists of a hollow 1 / 2 -inch diameter tube, threaded on both ends so that it may be passed through the walls of a circular pipe and sealed against the pipe wall at each end by a <b>hex</b> <b>nut</b> and rubber bushing. The tube is plugged at one end and open at the other. At the mid-point of the tube and at 2 inches off center to each side, three 1 / 16 -inch diameter holes are drilled through the wall of the tube to allow water to enter the tube. The Mag-tube is installed so that these three pressure ports face directly upstream. Alignment marks on the plugged end of the tube ensure that the ports face upstream. A piece of clear vinyl tubing is connected to the open end of the Mag-tube and then to a manometer board or pressure transducer to allow measurement of the total pressure of the flo...|$|E
40|$|Rock bolts ensure {{structural}} stability for tunnels {{and many other}} underground structures. The pre-load on a rock bolt {{plays an important role}} in the structural reinforcement and it is vital to monitor the pre-load status of rock bolts. In this paper, a rock bolt pre-load monitoring method based on the piezoceramic enabled time reversal method is proposed. A lead zirconate titanate (PZT) patch transducer, which works as an actuator to generate stress waves, is bonded onto the anchor plate of the rock bolt. A smart washer, which is fabricated by sandwiching a PZT patch between two metal rings, is installed between the <b>hex</b> <b>nut</b> and the anchor plate along the rock bolt. The smart washer functions as a sensor to detect the stress wave. With the increase of the pre-load values on the rock bolt, the effective contact surface area between the smart washer and the anchor plate, benefiting the stress wave propagation crossing the contact surface. With the help of time reversal technique, experimental results reveal that the magnitude of focused signal clearly increases with the increase of the pre-load on a rock bolt before the saturation which happens beyond a relatively high value of the pre-load. The proposed method provides an innovative and real time means to monitor the pre-load level of a rock bolt. By employing this method, the pre-load degradation process on a rock bolt can be clearly monitored. Please note that, currently, the proposed method applies to only new rock bolts, on which it is possible to install the PZT smart washer...|$|E
