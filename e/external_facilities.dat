Results: We identified 2, 585 BH visits, of which 1, 083 (41. 9 %) resulted in discharge. A total of 1, 502 patient visits required inpatient psychiatric admission, and of these cases, 177 patients (11. 8 %; 95 % CI, 10. 2 %- 13. 5 %) required transfer to an <b>external</b> <b>facility.</b> The median ED length of stay for transferred patients was 13. 9 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 9. 3 - 20. 2 hours; range, 3. 0 - 243. 0 hours). The median distance for transport was 83 miles (IQR, 42 - 111 miles; range, 42 - 237 miles). In multivariable analysis, patients with suicidal or homicidal ideation had increased risk of transfer (odds ratio [OR] [95 % CI], 1. 93 [1. 22 - 3. 06]; P=. 005). Children younger than 18 years (OR [95 % CI], 2. 34 [1. 60 - 3. 40]; P<. 001) and adults older than 65 years (OR [95 % CI], 3. 46 [1. 93 - 6. 19]; P<. 001) {{were more likely to}} require transfer and travel farther to access care.

40|$|Today, {{there is}} a seldom seen {{interest}} for cross-country skiing. However, the winters are getting warmer, which causes lack of snow and hence a shortened skiing season. In order {{to solve this problem}} the company Lindbäcks Bygg plans to construct a ski tunnel at Lindbäcksstadion close to Piteå. At the request of this company, this master thesis aims to investigate different methods for an energy efficient supply of the tunnel’s snow demand. The main part of this project has considered design of systems for snow production and snow storage. Four different alternatives for the supply of snow to the tunnel have been investigated: outdoor storage and production of artificial snow, storage of natural snow and production of snow directly inside the ski tunnel or an <b>external</b> <b>facility.</b> These methods have been compared regarding energy consumption, costs and operation-related environmental impact in the terms of greenhouse gas emissions. It was found that the energy consumption was significantly higher for indoor than outdoor snow production, mainly because of the energy required for removal of the heat emitted when the water supplied to the snow gun changes phase into ice. The energy demand for storage and production of artificial snow was determined to 8. 5 MWh, which is equivalent to the demand for storage and transport of natural snow. The corresponding values for snow production inside the ski tunnel and the <b>external</b> production <b>facility</b> were calculated to 1. 5 and 1. 1 GWh respectively. From an economic perspective, outdoor snow production is also preferable. The highest investment cost is to be found for the <b>external</b> production <b>facility.</b> The operating costs are however higher for snow production inside the ski tunnel and notably lower for the two snow storage alternatives. The environmental impact related to operation is very low for all the alternatives, provided that the electricity demand is supplied by renewable sources. The highest greenhouse gas emissions are related to the transport and storage of natural snow. This alternative is also associated with high climate dependency and uncertainties regarding the snow quality, and is thus not appropriate to realize. Outdoor production and storage of snow is most favourable in regard to energy consumption, costs and environmental impact and is therefore the alternative that is primarily recommended for implementation at Lindbäcksstadion. If there are very high requirements on the snow quality, the snow should instead be produced in a controlled environment, preferably inside an <b>external</b> production <b>facility.</b> Validerat; 20140623 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
