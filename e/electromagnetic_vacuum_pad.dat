This paper {{is concerned with the}} development of a new energy-saving <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad</b> using CFD-technique. Nowadays, application of pneumatic <b>vacuum</b> <b>pads</b> may be found in many different real industries, especially in the field of automatic conveyer system, automatic assembly line, semiconductor industry as well as silicon wafer factory, etc. Traditional <b>vacuum</b> <b>pads</b> generally utilize nozzles to create the effect of vacuum. In this paper, however, a new idea to generate the effect of vacuum is proposed by designing a structure similar to that of an aerostatic bearing. In details, the air is guided to flow through an optimally designed restrictor inside the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad</b> and flow out through the outlet between the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad</b> and the sucked work-piece. Therefore, according to Bernoulli’s equation, the air pressure near the center line of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad</b> decreases because of the increased airflow velocity. Consequently, the effect of vacuum is generated. To achieve two preset requirements, that is, large suction force output and low air consumption, the commercial CFD-RC software is utilized to simulate the air flow field and design the optimal geometry inside the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad.</b> Experimental results further prove that the new <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad</b> with two preset features is successfully developed and implemented in this study. cs 201...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this article, a new {{proportional}} pneumatic floating <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad</b> {{is developed}} and constructed. There are two features concerning this new <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad.</b> The {{first is the}} inclusion of a proportional solenoid, which enables the continuously variable control of the suction force output. The floating mechanism design between the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad</b> and the work-piece is the second feature, which is more preferable in real industries because it can protect the surface of the work-piece from scratches or other damage. Moreover, in addition to the open-loop gap control mode, two closed-loop gap control schemes are proposed in this paper. The first is the constant gap control. A preset gap is input to the controller as the command input that further drives the proportional solenoid to maintain a steady-state gap between the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad</b> and the work-piece. In the second control approach, the gap between the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad</b> and the work-piece is kept as large as possible to minimize the energy consumption. Both closed-loop control schemes are successfully implemented in this study...|$|R
40|$|Proposing {{a system}} of two {{rotatable}} nanoparticles (NPs) {{in the presence of}} <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vacuum</b> fluctuations, using the framework of canonical quantization, the electromagnetic and matter fields have been quantized. The non-contact frictional torque, affecting the rotation of NPs due to the presence of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vacuum</b> fluctuations and also by the matter field fluctuations have been derived. Considering the distance between NPs less than 100 nm in the near-field, we observe the rotations are phase locked. It has been shown that the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vacuum</b> fluctuations play the role of noises to break down the synchronization. Also surprisingly, we find the frictional torque between NPs in the near-field is much bigger than the popular contact friction between them where it causes a robust synchronization in the near-field.

40|$|An {{expression}} for the binary correlation Fourier transform in a relativistic classical electron gas is derived using the Liouville equation for matter plus field. In many cases, {{the temperature of}} matter does not equal that of radiation; it is shown that the two particles correlation depends in a very crucial way on {{the difference between the}} particles and field temperatures. The well known cases of the black body and <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vacuum</b> field distributions are easily recovered. It is shown that due to the absence of the law of action and reaction for electromagnetic forces, no relativistic Boltzmann factor exists in the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vacuum</b> case and that the methods of equilibrium statistical mechanics to calculate thermodynamic properties fail. © 1957.

40|$|In {{coherent}} control, <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vacuum</b> fluctuations usually cause coherence loss through irreversible spontaneous emission. However, {{since the}} dissipation via emission is essentially due to correlation of the fluctuations, when emission {{ends in a}} superposition of multiple final states, correlation between different pathways may build up if the "which-way" information is not fully resolved (i. e., the emission spectrum is broader than the transition energy range). Such correlation can be exploited for spin-flip control in a Λ-type three-level system, which manifests itself as an all-optical spin echo in nonlinear optics with two orders of optical fields saved as compared with stimulated Raman processes. This finding represents {{a new class of}} optical nonlinearity induced by <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vacuum</b> fluctuations. Comment: 7 pages including 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} the engineering of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vacuum</b> in a 2 D– 3 D photonic bandgap (PBG) hetero-structure. This facilitates {{the development of}} novel active devices and the observation of novel quantum electrodynamic phenomena. We consider a specific architecture suitable as an all-optical micro-transistor capable of novel ultra-fast response with low switching power requirements. This relies on a unique collective atomic switching and population inversion achieved by coherent resonant pumping in a suitably engineered vacuum. Specific waveguide architectures within the 3 D PBG micro-chip provide local density-of-states (LDOS) peaks near their cutoff frequency. These provide ‘‘building blocks’’ for <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vacuum</b> engineering without recourse to conventional high Q-factor micro-cavities. For the all-optical micro-transistor, a fork shape LDOS within the micro-chip is desirable, using trimodal waveguide architecture.

40|$|Based on a {{microscopic}} approach, we propose a Lagrangian for the combined system of a rotating dielectric nanoparticle above a plane {{surface in the}} presence of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vacuum</b> fluctuations.

The radiative heat power absorbed by the rotating nanoparticle is obtained and the result is in agreement with previous results when the the rotational frequency of the nanoparticle is zero or much smaller than the relaxation frequency of the dielectrics. The well known near field effect is reexamined and discussed in terms of the rotational frequency. The radiative heat power absorbed by the nanoparticle for well-known peak frequencies, is plotted in terms of the rotational frequency showing an interesting effect resembling a phase transition around a critical frequency, determined by the relaxation frequency of the dielectrics...|$|R

40|$|Quantum {{fluctuations}} of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vacuum</b> {{are responsible}} for physical effects such as the Casimir force and the radiative decay of atoms, and set fundamental limits on the sensitivity of measurements. Entanglement between photons can produce correlations that result in a reduction of these fluctuations below the vacuum level allowing measurements that surpass the standard quantum limit in sensitivity. Here we demonstrate that the radiative decay rate of an atom that is coupled to quadrature squeezed <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>vacuum</b> can be reduced below its natural linewidth. We observe a two-fold reduction of the transverse radiative decay rate of a superconducting artificial atom coupled to continuum squeezed vacuum generated by a Josephson parametric amplifier, allowing the transverse coherence time T_ 2 to exceed the vacuum decay limit of 2 T_ 1. We demonstrate that the measured radiative decay dynamics {{can be used to}} tomographically reconstruct the Wigner distribution of the the itinerant squeezed state. Our results are the first confirmation of a canonical prediction of quantum optics and open the door to new studies of the quantum light-matter interaction. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
