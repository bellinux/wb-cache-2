5|$|In {{the city}} of Trieste, then subject to Austrian rule, the Jewish {{community}} saw positive change under Maria Theresa's rule. On 19 April 1771, Maria Theresa granted two Sovereign Licenses to the <b>Jews</b> <b>of</b> Trieste, licenses that constitute real regulations. In 1782, with the famous Edict of Tolerance, her son Joseph II admitted the Jews to some charges in the Stock Exchange and to other liberal professions. A year later the Jewish primary school was opened {{with the name of}} Scuole Pie Normali Israelitiche. The following year, in 1784, the gates of the Ghetto were opened so that the <b>Jews</b> <b>of</b> Trieste could live together with their fellow citizens of different religions; however most of them continued to live in the Ghetto. Maria Theresa's influence and personal prejudices were limited by the 1780s, and the <b>Jews</b> <b>of</b> Trieste lived in relative peace until the beginning of French rule in the region.|$|E

The delegation, concerned primarily {{with the release of}} the imprisoned <b>Jews</b> <b>of</b> Damascus, decided to accept their liberation without any judicial declaration of their innocence or formal denunciation of the blood libel. The liberation order was issued on August 28, 1840, and, as a compromise, it stated explicitly that {{it was an act of}} justice rather than a pardon granted by the ruler.|$|E

5|$|A {{consensus}} formed {{within the}} European diplomatic community in Constantinople that {{the persecution of}} the accused Jews had to be stopped. This opinion was held not only by Lord Ponsonby, but also by von Stürmer, whose correspondence revealed {{that he was not}} at all convinced of the innocence of the Jews; by the French ambassador Edouard Pontois, whose government stood by the French consuls who supported blood libels in Rhodes and Damascus; and by the Prussian ambassador Hans von Königsmark. Consequently, the way was open for Lord Ponsonby, by far the most powerful diplomat in Constantinople, to intervene unopposed on behalf the <b>Jews</b> <b>of</b> Rhodes.|$|E
