50|$|Messages are routed in {{networks}} of C104s using interval routing. In a network where each destination is uniquely numbered, interval routing associates non-overlapping, contiguous ranges of destinations with each output link. An output link for a packet is chosen {{by comparing the}} destination (contained in the packet's header) to each interval and choosing the one that contains the destination. The benefits of interval routing are that it is sufficient to provide <b>deterministic</b> <b>routing</b> {{on a range of}} network topologies and that can be implemented simply with a table-based lookup, so it delivers routing decisions with low latency. Interval routing can be used to implement efficient routing strategies for many classes of regular network topology.|$|E
40|$|AbstractRouting {{is a key}} design {{factor to}} obtain the maximum {{performance}} out of interconnection networks. Depending {{on the number of}} routing options that packets may use, routing algorithms are classified into two categories. If the packet can only use a single predetermined path, routing is deterministic, whereas if several paths are available, it is adaptive. It is well-known that adaptive routing usually outperforms <b>deterministic</b> <b>routing.</b> However, adaptive routers are more complex and introduces out-of-order delivery of packets. In this paper, we take up the challenge of developing a <b>deterministic</b> <b>routing</b> algorithm for direct topologies that can obtain a similar performance than adaptive routing, while providing the inherent advantages of <b>deterministic</b> <b>routing</b> such as in-order delivery of packets and implementation simplicity.

3000|$|Much work {{points out}} that the {{benefits}} of network coding are different for the same flow by using different routes. So {{the question of how to}} find out the best route with network coding is still open until now. Most of the coding-aware routing schemes are based on <b>deterministic</b> <b>routing</b> protocols [3, 4]. Due to the characteristic of network coding, these schemes cannot work well when the data flows change frequently. The reason is that route must be preprogrammed in <b>deterministic</b> <b>routing</b> protocols. However, network coding depends on the flows and routes simultaneously. So doing coding-aware routing in <b>deterministic</b> <b>routing</b> protocols must bind flows and routes together. This causes low stability of routes when the state of flows (such as on or off, or the rate of flow) is changed frequently. For example, assume that the best NC-aware route is R [...]...|$|E

40|$|In {{this section}} {{we look at}} {{adaptive}} routing, i. e. the path taken by a packet may not only depend on its source and destination {{but also on the}} current situation in the network. Adaptive routing has several advantages over oblivious routing: • It is possible to achieve good <b>routing</b> results with <b>deterministic</b> adaptive <b>routing</b> strategies, whereas we know from the Borodin-Hopcroft lower bound that <b>deterministic</b> oblivious <b>routing</b> strategies may perform poorly in certain situations. • Many adaptive routing strategies can adapt quickly to faulty nodes or edges in the network, whereas in oblivious routing faulty nodes or edges may disconnect certain source-destination pairs and therefore may require the computation of new path system, which may be expensive. • The congestion of adaptive routing strategies can be better than what can be achieved by oblivious routing strategies. (Note the lower bound of Ω(C P OPT log n) for oblivious routing on the mesh.) However, adaptive routing usually also has some weaknesses: • A high freedom of choosing a path for a packet may cause high delays for the packets, since it may take a while until the algorithm converges towards good paths...|$|R

Concerning topology, most of the commercially available interconnects are based on fat-tree. Fat-trees offer a rich connectivity among nodes, making possible to obtain paths between all source-destination pairs that do not share any link.

40|$|Abstract. Opportunistic routing {{has been}} shown to achieve the high {{throughput}} of the wireless mesh network with lossy channels. Different from <b>deterministic</b> <b>routing</b> mechanisms in which a frame is transmitted and forwarded along with a fixed and predetermined path, the opportunistic routing technique allows multiple nodes hearing the frame to form the forwarder set containing promising candidates for the frame forwarding. Existing opportunistic routing protocols typically choose among forwarding candidates based on the decision made from the transmitter disregarding the current loads in candidates. In this paper, the opportunistic frame forwarding mechanism with considering backlog of frames among forwarders is proposed and analyzed. Specifically, in addition {{to take into account the}} delivery probability, our proposal restricts members of the forwarder set for a given transmitter to those wireless nodes whose transmission range covers one another and makes the true forwarder picked from the forward set of a given transmitting frame being the one who gains access to wireless channel for the frame before others do. Therefore, the efficient and load-balanced opportunistic routing for wireless mesh networks can be achieved. Analytic results show that the proposed method compared to the <b>deterministic</b> <b>routing</b> methodology can achieve the high frame delivery ratio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} fluid models of two-station multiclass {{queueing}} networks with <b>deterministic</b> <b>routing.</b> A fluid model is globally stable if the fluid network eventually empties under each nonidling dispatch policy. We explicitly characterize the global stability region {{in terms of}} the arrival and service rates. We show that the global stability region is defined by the nominal workload conditions and the "virtual workload conditions" and we introduce two intuitively appealing phenomena: virtual stations and push starts, that explain the virtual workload conditions. When any of the workload conditions is violated, we construct a fluid solution that cycles to innity, showing that the fluid network is unstable. When all of the workload conditions are satisfied, we solve a network flow problem to find the coefficients of a piecewise linear Lyapunov function. The Lyapunov function decreases to zero proving that the fluid level eventually reaches zero under any non-idling dispatch policy. Under certain assumptions on the interarrival and service time distributions, a queueing network is stable or positive Harris recurrent if the corresponding uid network is stable. Thus, the workload conditions are sufficient to ensure the global stability of two-station multiclass queueing networks with <b>deterministic</b> <b>routing...</b>|$|E

Compared to <b>deterministic</b> <b>routing,</b> adaptive routing alleviates the congestion problem at higher packet injection rates by distributing packets across multiple routing paths.
