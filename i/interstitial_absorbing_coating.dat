Experimental results are in good agreement with those obtained by the side-diffraction technique. Both techniques are compared with respect to simplicity of the setup and the yield of information. Fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) are widely used for telecommunication and sensor systems. In some cases {{it is important to}} know the axial distribution of the grating parameters as well as the exact grating location in the fiber. The most common and simplest way of the grating characterization is measuring its transmission/reflection spectrum. This method determines only the integral characteristics of the FBG. To obtain the spatial distribution of local grating properties other techniques such as OLCR [1], side-diffraction [2], heat-scan [3] can be used.
