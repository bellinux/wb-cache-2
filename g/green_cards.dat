5|$|In October, U.S. District Court Judge James Robart {{ordered that}} Path America and its assets {{be removed from}} Dargey's control and placed into receivership, {{including}} the Potala Tower project. A recovery plan was filed in January by the court receiver, proposing to sell all of Path America's projects, which Dargey and several investors opposed {{on the grounds of}} possible loss of EB-5 eligibility. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services instead revoked the Potala Tower project of EB-5 eligibility in March 2016, closing the possibility of granting <b>green</b> <b>cards</b> for project investors. The receiver was granted partial approval to sell the project in April; 13 bids were received for the property and/or project, including from local firm Vulcan Real Estate, Las Vegas-based Molasky Group, and Chinese developer and original investor Binjiang Tower Corporation. On May 20, 2016, Judge James Robart approved a plan submitted by the receiver on behalf of Molasky and Binjiang, committing $30 million to the project and allowing for construction to resume pending final approval by foreign investors; Dargey approved the plan after a deal was struck with the new developers to pay $1.8 million of the attorney fees he had accrued during the trial.|$|E
25|$|Up until 2004, {{recipients}} of asylee status faced a wait of approximately fourteen years to receive permanent resident status after receiving their initial status, {{because of an}} annual cap of 10,000 <b>green</b> <b>cards</b> for this class of individuals. However, in May 2005, {{under the terms of}} a proposed settlement of a class-action lawsuit, Ngwanyia v. Gonzales, brought on behalf of asylees against CIS, the government agreed to make available an additional 31,000 <b>green</b> <b>cards</b> for asylees during the period ending on September 30, 2007. This is in addition to the 10,000 <b>green</b> <b>cards</b> allocated for each year until then and was meant to speed up the green card waiting time considerably for asylees. However, the issue was rendered somewhat moot by the enactment of the REAL ID Act of 2005 (Division B of United States Public Law 109-13 (H.R. 1268)), which eliminated the cap on annual asylee <b>green</b> <b>cards.</b> Currently, an asylee who has continuously resided in the US for more than one year in that status has an immediately available visa number.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} <b>green</b> <b>cards</b> {{that can be}} granted to family-based {{applicants}} depends on what preference category they fall under. An unlimited number of immediate relatives can receive <b>green</b> <b>cards</b> {{because there is no}} quota for that category. Family members who fall under the other various preference categories have fixed quotas, however the number of visas issued from each category may vary because unused visas from one category may rollover into another category.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two tests}} to {{determine}} permanent residency: the <b>Green</b> <b>Card</b> Test and the Substantial Presence Test. Almost everybody in student status is likely to fail the <b>Green</b> <b>Card</b> Test since it applies only {{to people who have}} held a <b>green</b> <b>card</b> in the tax year. The relevant test for students is therefore the Substantial Presence Test.|$|R

25|$|United States lawful {{permanent}} residency, informally {{known as}} green card, is the immigration {{status of a}} person authorized {{to live and work}} in the United States of America permanently. <b>Green</b> <b>cards</b> are valid for 10 years for permanent residents, and 2 years for conditional permanent residents. After this period, the card must be renewed or replaced. The application process may take several years. An immigrant usually has to go through a three-step process to get permanent residency that includes petition and processing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Green</b> <b>cards</b> were {{formerly}} {{issued by}} the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. No. 107–296, 116 Stat. 2135) dismantled INS and separated the former agency into three components within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The first, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), handles applications for immigration benefits. Two other agencies were created to oversee the INS's former functions of immigration enforcement: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), respectively.|$|E
25|$|According to Immigration Equality, an {{advocacy}} organization, in 2009 there were roughly 36,000 bi-national same-sex couples unable to secure <b>green</b> <b>cards</b> for one partner. The census recorded 594,391 same-sex couples, six percent composed of one citizen and one non-citizen. A 2006 report compiled by Human Rights Watch and Immigration Equality documented {{the cases of}} couples who did not report their participation in a same-sex relationship to the 2000 U.S. Census because they feared anti-LGBT bias in the immigration process or because their foreign partners {{were living in the}} United States illegally.|$|E

Among the boys, Jagjit Singh mentioned that the choice of songs was very good {{and it was a very}} difficult decision. Niladri got the <b>green</b> <b>card</b> as he had sung well, but there was a tie between Rajeev and Bhumik. Both sang songs of their choice, as they could not arrive at one common song. Eventually, Rajeev got the <b>green</b> <b>card.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ou {{had planned}} to retire after turning 65 and applied for {{permanent}} residency (‘green card’) in the United States of America. Although he had {{not expected to be}} tapped as Foreign Minister when Ma Ying-jeou formed his new government in 2008, Ou accepted Ma's offer. He immediately gave up his <b>green</b> <b>card</b> upon accepting his new post. His possession of a <b>green</b> <b>card</b> generated minor controversy in Taiwanese circles as many viewed the possession of extra-Taiwan status (citizenship or even a <b>green</b> <b>card)</b> as being unpatriotic. Ou, however, claimed that he was merely planning for his retirement, for most of his family members live in the US, and applied for a <b>green</b> <b>card</b> out of realistic thinking.|$|R
25|$|Democratic Progressive Party {{candidate}} Frank Hsieh questioned Ma for {{his possession}} of a US Permanent Resident Card. Ma denied having one and publicly expressed that no {{members of his family}} had one. However, the fact that Ma and his wife had applied for <b>green</b> <b>cards</b> and that his sisters and his elder daughter Lesley Weichung Ma are United States citizens caused controversy, as the DPP continued to question Ma's loyalty to the country. In response to the DPP attack on the US citizenship of his sisters and daughter, Ma commented that having a US passport or green card did not necessarily mean that someone was not loyal to Taiwan.|$|E
25|$|The {{applicant}} {{receives an}} I-551 stamp in their foreign passport upon approval of their case. The applicant is then {{free from the}} conditional requirement once the application is approved. The applicant's new Permanent Resident Card arrives via mail to their residence several weeks to several months later and replaces the old two-year conditional residence card. The new card must be renewed after 10 years, but permanent resident status is now granted for an indefinite term if residence conditions are satisfied at all times. USCIS may request to renew the card earlier because of security enhancements of the card or {{as a part of}} a revalidation campaign to exclude counterfeit <b>green</b> <b>cards</b> from circulation.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the current}} system, {{immediate}} family members (spouse, child, and dependent mother and father), have priority status for <b>green</b> <b>cards</b> and generally wait 6 {{months to a}} year to have their green card application approved. For non-immediate family members, the process may take up to 10 years. Paperwork is processed on a first-come, first-served basis, so new applications may go untouched for several months. To address the issue of slow processing times, USCIS has made a policy allowing applicants to submit the I-130 and I-485 forms at the same time. This has reduced the processing time. Another delay in the process comes when applications have mistakes. In these cases papers are sent back to the applicant, further delaying the process. Currently the largest issue creating long wait times is not processing time, but rather immigrant visa quotas set by Congress.|$|E

A Zogby poll released on August 15, 2008 indicated that most Republicans and Democrats wanted Barr included in the presidential debates. The poll also indicated that nearly 70% of independent voters would have liked to see him included.|$|E

Initially the immigrants came to know one another through their mutual love of Monty Python, Benny Hill, and Fawlty Towers. They began to have jam sessions afterwards and there was evident chemistry between the trio, which led to their writing songs together. They named themselves The Greencards in honor of the fact that all three band members carried United States <b>green</b> <b>cards.</b> They eventually began to perform shows locally in Austin to finance the recording of what would become their debut album, 2003's Movin' On.
