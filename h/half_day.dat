5|$|The <b>Half</b> <b>Day</b> area {{experienced}} an economic boom {{with the arrival}} of new settlers during the two decades after Wright's arrival. Among these pioneers were Seth Washburn, the first postmaster of the Vernon Township, who settled at the site of what later became the Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103's <b>Half</b> <b>Day</b> Intermediate School, and Laura Sprague, the first teacher to reside in the area. By 1855, 21years after the settling of the <b>Half</b> <b>Day</b> area by Wright, the town was a thriving community with a blacksmith's shop, sawmill, country store, and a church. At this time, the Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad connected Milwaukee to the county seat of Waukegan, and it expanded throughout the Lake County area over the next few decades; this also contributed to the town's prosperity. Henry Ford's invention of the automobile in the early 20thcentury made <b>Half</b> <b>Day</b> a more accessible destination to other communities within the Chicago metropolitan area, and the village became a popular recreation area. This prompted the opening of many businesses, including an amusement park, a race track, a bowling alley, a dance hall, and taverns, that catered to visitors.|$|E
5|$|Lincolnshire has two school districts: Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103 and Adlai E. Stevenson High School District 125, {{although}} a few students living in the village also attend school in Aptakisic-Tripp Community Consolidated School District 102 in neighboring Buffalo Grove. District103, which feeds into District 125, is home to three schools: Laura B. Sprague Elementary School (K-2), <b>Half</b> <b>Day</b> Intermediate School (3–4), and Daniel Wright Junior High School (5–8); District125 comprises only Adlai E. Stevenson High School. Both are public school districts, funded by the government.|$|E

5|$|Lincolnshire is {{a village}} in Vernon Township, Lake County, in the U.S. state of Illinois. The village is a {{northern}} suburb of Chicago. The population of Lincolnshire was 7,275 at the 2010 census. Lincolnshire was incorporated on August 5, 1957, from the unincorporated <b>Half</b> <b>Day</b> area when land was purchased to build a residential subdivision. The community underwent an aggressive era of expansion from 1983 to the 1990s. The Des Plaines River bisects the village, passing from north to south; Illinois Route 22 also divides the village into two parts, crossing the village from east to west.|$|E
5|$|Lincolnshire lies {{on three}} {{arterial}} roads: Illinois Route 22, {{which is known}} as <b>Half</b> <b>Day</b> Road in this area; Milwaukee Avenue, which appears as Illinois Route 21/U.S. Route 45; and Aptakisic Road, which meets Milwaukee in the southern region of Lincolnshire. Lincolnshire shares its eastern border with the village of Bannockburn at Interstate 94 (where it is {{a portion of the}} Tri-State Tollway). Route 22 crosses the Des Plaines River before bridging Bannockburn and Lincolnshire by arching over Interstate Highway 94.|$|E
5|$|The Lincolnshire {{area was}} {{originally}} {{a part of}} the town of <b>Half</b> <b>Day,</b> the first region settled by non-Native American peoples in Lake County. The first white settler in the Lincolnshire area was Captain Daniel Wright, who arrived in 1834. Chief Halfda allowed Wright to build his cabin {{at the south end of}} the Potawatomi village at the site of the intersection of present-day Milwaukee Avenue and Aptakisic Road. The Potawatomi tribesmen were ousted a year later in the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which was implemented two years after its ratification, and faced relocation.|$|E

5000|$|The Seven and a <b>Half</b> <b>Days</b> Revolt or Sicilian: [...] "Rivorta dû 7 e menzu" [...] Italian: [...] "Rivolta del sette e mezzo" [...] was an {{uprising}} in Palermo lasting from the 16 to 22 September 1866.

5|$|The {{village of}} Lincolnshire is {{a suburb of}} the city of Chicago in the {{southern}} reaches of Lake County; like Chicago, Lincolnshire is located in the extreme northeastern region of the state of Illinois. The Des Plaines River meanders through {{the eastern part of the}} village, dividing the town in half vertically at the village hall, while <b>Half</b> <b>Day</b> Road (Illinois Route 22) splits the village in half in an east–west direction. Milwaukee Avenue (U.S. Route 45) runs in a north–south direction through Lincolnshire, into the village of Buffalo Grove to the south and Vernon Hills to the north.|$|E
5|$|The first {{inhabitants}} {{of what would}} become the village of Lincolnshire were Native American Potawatomi migrants from Canada and Wisconsin. The tribesmen left these northern places in the 16thcentury in search of a warmer, more temperate climate. The first Europeans to visit the area were the French Jesuit explorers Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet. Shortly after arriving in 1673 at the site of what later became Waukegan, they sailed down the Des Plaines River and made contact with the local Potawatomi, who would dominate the area by 1768. One of the Potawatomi villages that they encountered stretched along {{the west bank of the}} Des Plaines River, from what later became Illinois Route 22 south to Aptakisic Road, the first real settlement in the Lincolnshire and <b>Half</b> <b>Day</b> region.|$|E
5|$|Lincolnshire's {{government}} initially {{adhered to}} a conservative and cautious approach, {{and refused to}} annex two corporate park divisions in the 1980s. Opponents to the village government's methods, however, won out in later years; supporting a quick growth to rival the increasing affluence of surrounding villages, they oversaw the cessions of the Marriott Lincolnshire Resort and Lincolnshire Corporate Center {{over a period of}} years following 1983. Lincolnshire also sought to annex the old remnants of the unincorporated community of <b>Half</b> <b>Day</b> from which it was created, but lost in a court battle with the village of Vernon Hills in 1994; the court case set the present-day border between the two villages, which lies along Route 22 up to its intersection with Milwaukee Avenue. To consolidate these new acquisitions, Lincolnshire set to work on a new village hall that was completed in 1993, and constructed a downtown area centered on the intersection of Aptakisic Road and Milwaukee Avenue; the village's endeavors included commercial regions like the Lincolnshire Corporate Center, City Park, and the Lincolnshire Commons. These facilities were planned and constructed from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s.|$|E

25|$|On September 5, 1885, {{the line}} was {{extended}} one more station to Alabama Avenue near the Howard House, a union station for the steam and horse railroads into East New York. Another east terminal at Van Siclen Avenue was opened on December 3, 1885, with the structure above Fulton Street extending east two more blocks to Schenck Street. After a <b>half</b> <b>day</b> of infrequent service, trains began serving the new station on a regular schedule the next morning.|$|E
25|$|The {{railroad}} {{was initially}} planned as a horsedrawn railroad, {{which would have}} been a significant improvement on the unpaved toll roads.

As financing the project was a problem, attention was paid to the area north of Danbury, along the Housatonic River.
