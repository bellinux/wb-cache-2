50|$|When the ASCII code {{is used to}} {{communicate}} between computer terminals, each terminal can send an <b>enquiry</b> <b>character</b> to request {{the condition of the}} other. The receiver of this character can respond with ACK (0000110) to indicate that it is operating normally, or NAK (also NACK) (0010101) to indicate an error condition. Unicode provides visible symbols for these characters, U+2406 (&#x2406;) and U+2415(‚êï).|$|E
50|$|The Teletype Model 33 {{contained}} an answer-back mechanism that was generally used in dial-up networks {{such as the}} TWX network. At {{the beginning of the}} message, the sending machine could transmit an <b>enquiry</b> <b>character</b> or WRU (Who aRe yoU) code, and the recipient machine would automatically initiate a response which was encoded in a rotating drum that could be programmed by breaking off tabs. The answer-back drum in the recipient machine would rotate and send an unambiguous identifying code to the sender, so the sender could verify connection to the correct recipient. The WRU code could also be sent {{at the end of the}} message. A correct response would confirm that the connection had remained unbroken during the message transmission. Finally, the sending machine operator would press the disconnect button. Note that the receiving machine did not need operator intervention. Since messages were often sent across multiple time zones to their destination, it was common to send a message to a location where the receiving machine was operating in an office that was closed and unmanned.|$|E
