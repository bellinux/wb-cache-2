In 1830, she submitted it to Rudolph Ackermann <b>for</b> <b>publication</b> <b>in</b> his children's magazine Forget-Me-Not; {{it was again}} rejected. In 1832, she sent it to Alaric Alexander Watts for consideration in his annual Literary Souvenir, however in her letter she suggested that the drama may be more appropriate for the juvenile publications edited by his wife, Priscilla Maden Watts.

5|$|Belenggu was {{submitted}} to Balai Pustaka <b>for</b> <b>publication</b> <b>in</b> 1938, but was accepted {{because of its}} perceived dissonance with public morality, particularly its portrayal of adultery and prostitution– key components of the plot– as acceptable.

Belenggu was the only novel published by the magazine and the first Indonesian psychological novel.

5|$|In 1925, Born and Heisenberg {{formulated}} {{the matrix}} mechanics representation of quantum mechanics. On 9 July, Heisenberg gave Born a paper entitled Über quantentheoretische Umdeutung kinematischer und mechanischer Beziehungen ("Quantum-Theoretical Re-interpretation of Kinematic and Mechanical Relations") to review, and submit <b>for</b> <b>publication.</b> <b>In</b> the paper, Heisenberg formulated quantum theory, avoiding the concrete, but unobservable, representations of electron orbits by using parameters such as transition probabilities for quantum jumps, which necessitated using two indexes {{corresponding to the}} initial and final states. When Born read the paper, he recognized the formulation as one which could be transcribed and extended to the systematic language of matrices, which he had learned from his study under Jakob Rosanes at Breslau University.|$|E
