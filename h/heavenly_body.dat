500|$|Rudolf Simek {{states that}} Nordic Bronze Age archaeological finds, such as rock carvings and the Trundholm sun chariot, provide ample {{evidence}} of the sun having been viewed as a life-giving <b>heavenly</b> <b>body</b> to the Bronze Age Scandinavians, and that the sun likely always received an amount of veneration. Simek states that the only {{evidence of the}} sun assuming a personification stems from the Old High German Incantation reference and from Poetic Edda poems, and that both of these references do not provide enough information to assume a Germanic sun cult. [...] "On the other hand", Simek posits, the [...] "great age of the concept is evident" [...] by the Trundholm sun chariot, which specifically supports {{the notion of the}} sun being drawn across the sky by horses. Simek further theorizes that the combination of sun symbols with ships in religious practices, which occur with frequency from the Bronze Age into Middle Ages, seem to derive from religious practices surrounding a fertility god (such as the Vanir gods Njörðr or Freyr), and not to a personified sun.|$|E

500|$|Quran [...] {{was part}} of the debate between medieval Muslim theologians and Muslims {{philosophers}} over the issue of the inviolability of <b>heavenly</b> <b>bodies.</b> The philosophers held that nature was composed of four fundamental elements: earth, air, fire, and water. These philosophers however held that the composition of <b>heavenly</b> <b>bodies</b> were different. This belief was based on the observation that the motion of <b>heavenly</b> <b>bodies,</b> unlike that of terrestrial bodies, was circular and without any beginnings or ends. This appearance of eternity in the <b>heavenly</b> <b>bodies,</b> led the philosophers to conclude that the heavens were inviolable. Theologians on the other hand proposed their own conception of the terrestrial matter: the nature was composed of uniform atoms that were re-created at every instant by God (the latter idea was added to defend God's omnipotence against the encroachment of the independent secondary causes). According to this conception, the <b>heavenly</b> <b>bodies</b> were essentially the same as the terrestrial bodies, and thus could be pierced.|$|R

2500|$|Canon Episcopi, a ninth century {{text that}} {{explored}} {{the subject of}} demonology, initially introduced concepts that would continuously be associated with witches, such as their ability to fly or their believed fornication and sexual relations with the devil.

Diana was described as having a <b>heavenly</b> <b>body</b> and as the [...] "protectress of childbirth and fertility" [...] while Herodias symbolized [...] "unbridled sensuality".
