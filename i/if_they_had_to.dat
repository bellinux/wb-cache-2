5|$|In early November 2008, the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, at an {{informal}} lunch with foreign diplomats, criticized Iceland's traditional friends (particularly Britain, Sweden and Denmark) {{as well as}} the International Monetary Fund. According to a memo from the Norwegian embassy, he suggested that the Russians might want to use the Keflavík Air Base, the Russian ambassador replied that they had no need for it. The President is quoted to have said that Iceland would soon recover, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fight alone. The President does not necessarily agree with the government on these issues.|$|E
5|$|On 3 January 1943, Kenney {{received}} intelligence from Allied Ultra codebreakers {{that the}} Japanese {{were about to}} attempt a reinforcement run from their main base at Rabaul to Lae, on the mainland of New Guinea. He ordered Walker {{to carry out a}} full-scale dawn attack on the harbor's shipping before it could depart. Walker demurred. His bombers would have difficulty making their rendezvous <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> leave Port Moresby in the dark. He recommended a noon attack instead. Kenney acknowledged Walker's concerns but was insistent; he preferred bombers out of formation to bombers shot down by the enemy fighters that were certain to intercept a daylight attack. In spite of this, Walker ordered that the attack be made at noon on 5 January.|$|E
5|$|The League {{resolved}} {{a dispute}} between the Kingdom of Iraq and the Republic of Turkey {{over control of the}} former Ottoman province of Mosul in 1926. According to the British, who had been awarded a League of Nations mandate over Iraq in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; on the other hand, the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic heartland. A League of Nations Commission of Inquiry, with Belgian, Hungarian and Swedish members, was sent to the region in 1924; it found that the people of Mosul {{did not want to be}} part of either Turkey or Iraq, but <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> choose, they would pick Iraq. In 1925, the commission recommended that the region stay part of Iraq, under the condition that the British hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years, to ensure the autonomous rights of the Kurdish population. The League Council adopted the recommendation and decided on 16 December 1925 to award Mosul to Iraq. Although Turkey had accepted League of Nations' arbitration in the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, it rejected the decision, questioning the Council's authority. The matter was referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which ruled that, when the Council made a unanimous decision, it must be accepted. Nonetheless, Britain, Iraq and Turkey ratified a separate treaty on 5 June 1926 that mostly followed the decision of the League Council and also assigned Mosul to Iraq. It was agreed that Iraq could still apply for League membership within 25 years and that the mandate would end upon its admittance.|$|E

25|$|At Ava, Hsinbyushin famously did not panic at the {{prospect}} of a large Chinese army (about 30,000) at the doorstep. The court urged the king to flee but he scornfully refused, saying he and his brother princes, sons of Alaungpaya, would fight the Chinese single-handed <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to.</b> Instead of defending the capital, Hsinbyushin calmly sent an army to take up position outside Singu, personally leading his men toward the front line.|$|E
25|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century the Academy in Düsseldorf had become a center for {{training}} Norwegian artists, but within Norway there arose a debate {{as to whether the}} art was truly Norwegian as it did not originate in Norway, and was in fact produced by artists who had been trained in Germany. The debate was sparked by proposals to build an art school in Norway, and it was therefore essential for supporters of a Norwegian academy to argue that Norwegian values could not be instilled in the artists <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go abroad.|$|E
25|$|Genghis Khan, {{leader of}} the Mongolian Empire in the 13th century AD {{employed}} less subtle techniques. Defeating {{the will of the}} enemy before having to attack and reaching a consented settlement was preferable to actually fighting. The Mongol generals demanded submission to the Khan, and threatened the initially captured villages with complete destruction if they refused to surrender. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fight to take the settlement, the Mongol generals fulfilled their threats and massacred the survivors. Tales of the encroaching horde spread to the next villages and created an aura of insecurity that undermined the possibility of future resistance.|$|E

25|$|The retinue of a besieged castle usually {{consisted}} {{of only a}} few able-bodied men. If the siege was foreseen, the castle's peacetime complement of three to twenty men could be doubled or tripled. And in an emergency, at least the higher ranks could take refuge in the main tower. A castle was only regarded as conquered when the bergfried had fallen. This could take some weeks. During this time the attacker had to continue to feed and pay his men. Sometimes, therefore, the mercenaries of the besieger just ran away or even turned against their commander, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> wait too long for success.|$|E
25|$|Eugene Nagel {{became aware}} of Pantridge's work in 1967. He {{believed}} that the physician-staffed model of prehospital care {{was not going to}} work for the United States in general or for Miami in particular. Physicians were too expensive to sit around fire stations waiting for calls, and <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be picked up in hospitals, it would take too long to arrive at the scene. When Nagel or his colleague James Hirschman, rode on the ambulance themselves they could, of course, defibrillate and provide medications, but they could not be present on all shifts. Nagel became convinced {{it was time to move}} away from a program using physicians to one staffed by paramedics.|$|E
25|$|Childhood amnesia (also {{known as}} {{infantile}} amnesia) {{is the common}} inability to remember events from one's own childhood. Sigmund Freud notoriously attributed this to sexual repression, while modern scientific approaches generally attribute it to aspects of brain development or developmental psychology, including language development, which may be why people do not easily remember pre-language events. Researchers have found that implicit memories cannot be recalled or described. Remembering {{how to play the}} piano is a common example of implicit memory, as is walking, speaking and other everyday activities that would be difficult to focus on <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be relearned every time one got up in the morning. Explicit memories, on the other hand, can be recalled and described in words. Remembering the first time meeting a teacher is an example of explicit memories.|$|E

500|$|The {{transport}} economics rationale for implementing congestion pricing on roads, described as [...] "one policy {{response to the}} problem of congestion", was summarized in testimony to the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee in 2003: [...] "congestion is considered to arise from the mispricing of a good; namely, highway capacity at a specific place and time. The quantity supplied (measured in lane-miles) is less than the quantity demanded at what is essentially a price of zero. If a good or service is provided free of charge, people tend to demand more of it—and use it more wastefully—than they would <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay a price that reflected its cost. Hence, congestion pricing is premised on a basic economic concept: charge a price in order to allocate a scarce resource to its most valuable use, as evidenced by users' willingness to pay for the resource".|$|E
500|$|Middle-class blacks {{throughout}} the United States [...] "were {{not at all}} sure how to behave or how whites would behave toward them", as Bart Landry puts it. In Cincinnati, the African-American newspaper editor Wendell Dabney wrote of the situation in the 1920s that [...] "hotels, restaurants, eating and drinking places, almost universally are closed to all people in whom the least tincture of colored blood can be detected." [...] Areas without significant black populations outside the South often refused to accommodate them: not one hotel or other accommodation was open to blacks in Salt Lake City, in the 1920s. Black travelers were stranded <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> stop there overnight. Only six percent of the more than 100 motels that lined U.S. Route 66 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, admitted black customers. Across the whole state of New Hampshire, only three motels in 1956 served African Americans.|$|E

500|$|Reinforced by Montagu, Oxford and Exeter a {{few days}} later, Warwick {{followed}} the Yorkists' trail. He hoped that London, under Somerset's control, would close its gates to Edward, allowing him to catch the Yorkist army in the open. The city, however, welcomed Edward warmly; Somerset had left {{the city and the}} London populace preferred the young Yorkist king to Henry VI. The old king greeted his usurper warmly and offered himself into custody, trusting [...] " [...] life to be in no danger in [...] hands." [...] Lancastrian scouts probed Barnet, which lay [...] north of London, but were beaten off. On 13 April their main army took up positions on a ridge of high ground north of Barnet to prepare for battle the next day. Warwick arrayed his army in a line from east to west, {{on either side of the}} Great North Road running through Barnet. Oxford held the right flank and Exeter the left. Montagu commanded the centre, and Warwick readied himself to command from among the reserves. The earl displaced his entire line slightly to the west; a depression at the rear of his left flank could impede Exeter's group <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fall back.|$|E
500|$|The Commander, Allied Air Forces, South West Pacific Area, Lieutenant General George Kenney, {{ordered his}} bomber commander, Brigadier General Kenneth Walker, {{to carry out}} a {{full-scale}} dawn bombing attack on the shipping in Rabaul Harbour before it could depart. Walker demurred; his bombers would have difficulty making their rendezvous <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> leave Port Moresby at night. He recommended a noon attack instead. Kenney acknowledged Walker's concerns but was insistent; he preferred bombers out of formation to bombers shot down by the enemy fighters that were sure to intercept a daylight attack. Inclement weather precluded participation by bombers from Australia, so all that was available were the aircraft on hand in Papua: six B-17s and six B-24s. In spite of Kenney's orders, Walker attacked Rabaul Harbour at noon on 5 January, and encountered heavy flak and continuous fighter attacks. Forty [...] and 24 [...] bombs were dropped from [...] The formation claimed hits on nine ships, totalling 50,000 tons. Two B-17s were shot down, including the one carrying Walker, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.
