Morgan Holmes states that, while children who reach the same age and circumstances will be in the same position, then they will [...] "be permitted access to the conditions that protect their autonomies". Other <b>intersex</b> <b>children</b> will not benefit, in particular at the point they are born: [...] "In its worst potential implications and uses, the court's decision may simply amplify the need to expedite procedures".|$|R
5000|$|Multiple {{organizations}} have highlighted appeals to LGBT rights recognition {{that fail to}} address the issue of unnecessary [...] "normalising" [...] treatments on <b>intersex</b> <b>children,</b> using the portmanteau term [...] "pinkwashing".

"Mind the Gaps: Intersex and (Re-productive) Spaces in Disability Studies and Bioethics" [...] (June 2008), argues that, while clinicians {{presume that}} [...] "intersex {{characteristics}} are inherently disabling to social viability", {{recognition of the}} personhood of the <b>intersex</b> <b>child</b> necessitates refraining from [...] "aggressive interference".

50|$|In June 2016, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child {{questioned}} the Nepalese government, and identified concerns about: (a) The {{lack of awareness}} of issues related to <b>intersex</b> <b>children</b> in Nepal and {{the high levels of}} stigma and discrimination faced by intersex children; (b) The challenges faced by <b>intersex</b> <b>children</b> to access identity documents that correspond with the sex/gender identity of their choosing; and, (c) Cases of medically unnecessary surgeries and other procedures on <b>intersex</b> <b>children</b> before they are able to provide their informed consent, which often entail irreversible consequences and can cause severe physical and psychological suffering, and the lack of redress and compensation in such cases. The Committee called for investigations of human rights violations, education of medical professionals, and access to redress.|$|R

5000|$|The song [...] "Annabel" [...] was {{inspired}} by Kathleen Winter's 2010 novel of the same name, about an <b>intersex</b> <b>child</b> being raised as a boy.

5000|$|The {{main goal}} of interACT is to end non-medically {{necessary}} surgeries on <b>intersex</b> <b>children.</b> Zieselman describes how <b>intersex</b> <b>children</b> {{just have a}} different type of body, and genital surgeries are not medical or social emergencies. Zieselman describes how shame and secrecy, and medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex infants causes devastating physical and psychological harm, but they take place for sociological reasons. She calls for a moratorium on surgeries until children are old enough to choose for themselves, with parents given a [...] "full spectrum of choices".|$|R

5000|$|In {{countries}} around the world, <b>intersex</b> infants, <b>children</b> and adolescents are subjected to medically unnecessary surgeries, hormonal treatments and other procedures {{in an attempt to}} forcibly change their appearance to be in line with societal expectations about female and male bodies.

5000|$|Sam Lyomoki, a Ugandan MP and a doctor, {{has stated}} that the {{parliament}} [...] "issued guidelines in 2015 to the Ministry of Health advising against surgical intervention for intersex infants", however, [...] "Local radio stations in Uganda buzz with appeals seeking donors to help fund genital reshaping surgery abroad" [...] and surgeries are also carried out within Uganda. Local organization SIPD Uganda [...] "advocates for the 'best guess' non-surgical approach where an <b>intersex</b> <b>child</b> should be raised in the best-suited gender, without irreversible surgical intervention, until they can be active participants in the decision".|$|E
50|$|Intersex {{persons in}} Bulgaria {{are even more}} marginalized and {{invisible}} in the society than the transgender community. To date, most Bulgarians wrongly use the word hermaphrodite rather than the correct term intersex. There is no data {{of the number of}} intersex babies born in the country. The standard procedure in a case of an <b>intersex</b> <b>child</b> birth is the removal of the male genitalia, {{due to the fact that}} it is an easier operation than the one removing the female genitalia. The parents are rarely informed of the damages this could later cause to the child's gender identity. There are no laws concerning intersex people.|$|E
5000|$|In Sentencia T-551/99, {{later in}} 1999, the Court ruled {{in the case}} of NN, a two-year-old <b>intersex</b> <b>child</b> unable to consent to genital surgeries.

[...] However, this did not exist {{in the case of}} NN, because the [...] "parents were led to believe that genital-normalizing surgery was the only option for their daughter. The parents did not examine alternative options to surgery; therefore, their decision did not consider {{the best interests of the}} child".|$|E
