The 2010 season saw them appear in six races, while the 2011 season saw nine races. The company was also advertised on the rear <b>deck</b> <b>lid</b> of Brad's No. 2 Dodge Charger in the 2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.|$|E
25|$|The AMC Cavalier {{featured}} a minimal amount of ornamentation compared to contemporary production cars, but was comparable to popular foreign makes as AMC {{was interested in}} marketing the car overseas. Utility was enhanced with dual-action scissor-type hinges on the <b>deck</b> <b>lid</b> {{so it could be}} opened like a normal trunk lid, or elevated to the height of the car's roof to accommodate tall, large, and bulky items in the trunk area.|$|E

2500|$|Early 1960 models, {{particularly}} the V200 high-trim cars, featured extensive brightwork and ornamentation. An [...] chrome spear atop each front fender, an inner reveal {{ring on the}} <b>deck</b> <b>lid's</b> spare tire stamping, a [...] "V200" [...] nameplate on the dashboard, and stainless steel windshield and backlight reveal moldings, which were deleted from production, replaced with less costly flexible mylar-faced plastic locking stripsâ€”in approximately January, 1960. Early and late V200s had a continuous stainless steel molding following the tailfin crease as it swept {{down in front of}} the rear wheel, then continuing forward along the lower break line in both doors and the front fender. The radiator grille was brite-dipped stamped aluminum, and a central grille badge doubled as the hood release.

BIW is termed before painting & before moving parts (doors, hoods, and <b>deck</b> <b>lids</b> as well as fenders), the engine, chassis sub-assemblies, or trim (glass, seats, upholstery, electronics, etc.) have been assembled in the frame structure.|$|R
25|$|The 1967 models {{received}} {{nothing more}} than a touch-up after a restyling for 1966. All Novas got a crosshatch pattern that filled the <b>deck</b> <b>lid</b> trim panel. The Nova officially was still called the Chevy II Nova and had overtaken the bottom-rung Chevy II 100 in sales. The Chevy II 100 lacked {{much in the way of}} trim or brightwork. 1967 models carried significant improvements in the area of safety equipment. A government-mandated energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, soft interior parts such as armrests and sun visors, recessed instrument panel knobs, and front shoulder belt anchors, were included in all 1967 models.|$|E
25|$|Two kit {{versions}} of the Chrysler Turbine Car were significant - a standard bronze colored promotional authentic to the cars used by the public, and a white version that {{was the color of}} one of the test mules, which was also lent for the making of the movie The Lively Set. This model had a friction motor and fewer than 500 were produced. Some of the Turbine models were nearly as incredible as the real car, with such details as folding seats, opening doors, hood, <b>deck</b> <b>lid,</b> and steerable front wheels. Chassis detail was remarkable, accurately depicting the huge ducting passages running the length of the car needed to expel the turbine's waste gasses.|$|E

5000|$|... 1973 models {{featured}} significantly enlarged [...] "elephant foot" [...] taillamps {{mounted in}} reshaped rear fenders. In the engine bay, the oil-bath air cleaner {{gave way to}} a dry element filter, and the generator was replaced with an alternator. The 1302/Super became the 1303 with a new taller wrap-around windscreen. The changes to the cowl and windshield resulted in slight redesign of the front hood. The instrument panel, formerly shared with the standard Beetle, was all-new and incorporated a raised speedometer pod, rocker-style switches and side-window defrosters. The limited-edition GSR (Gelb-Schwarzer Renner; German for [...] "Yellow-Black Racer") was a 1303 S available only in Saturn Yellow paint equipped with special 5.5 in wide sport wheels fitted with 175/70-15 Pirelli Cinturato CN36 high-performance radial tires. Front and rear <b>deck</b> <b>lids</b> were finished in matte black, as was all exterior trim {{with the exception of the}} chrome headlamp bezels. Inside were corduroy and leatherette high-bolstered sport seats and a small diameter three-spoke steering wheel with padded leather rim and a small red VW logo on the bottom spoke. In North America, the GSR was sold as the Super Beetle Sports Bug. The North American model had body-color <b>deck</b> <b>lids</b> and was available in Marathon Blue Metallic in addition to Saturn Yellow. In some markets, the sport wheels (in both 4.5-inch and 5.5-inch widths), sport steering wheel and sport seats became available as stand-alone options.|$|R

Rear suspension and brakes from the Corvair were also part of the package. The resulting car was called the Devin C. Like the Devin D, it was offered as a component car in kit form with a painted body already bonded to the frame, laminated windshield, and doors and <b>deck</b> <b>lids</b> already attached or as a completed car built by Devin Enterprises. In kit form the Devin C sold for US$2500.00 and US$4500.00. for the complete assembled car.|$|R

25|$|A {{rear spoiler}} usually comes {{standard}} in most sports vehicles and resembles {{the shape of}} a raised wing {{in the rear of the}} vehicle. The main purpose of a rear spoiler in a vehicle's design is to counteract lift, thereby increasing stability at higher speeds. In order to achieve the lowest possible drag, air must flow around the streamlined body of the vehicle without coming into contact with any areas of possible turbulence. A rear spoiler design that stands off the rear <b>deck</b> <b>lid</b> will increase downforce, reducing lift at high speeds while incurring a drag penalty. Flat spoilers, possibly angled slightly downward may reduce turbulence and thereby reduce the coefficient of drag. Some cars now feature automatically adjustable rear spoilers, so at lower speed the effect on drag is reduced when the benefits of reduced lift are not required.|$|E

25|$|The Mustang Bullitt {{returned}} in February 2008, {{a variant of}} the Mustang GT, the last version of which was produced in 2001. It is reminiscent of the Dark Highland Green GT-390 fastback Mustang driven by Steve McQueen in the 1968 film Bullitt. Available in Dark Highland Green or Black exterior paint without spoiler and GT fender emblems; the faux gas cap on the <b>deck</b> <b>lid</b> is replaced by a unique Bullitt version. The Mustang GT's standard fog light-equipped grille is replaced with a specially designed pony-less style grille highlighted by an aluminium accent. Dark Argent Gray 18-inch cast-aluminum euro-flange wheels are used with matching brake calipers and larger, 3.5inch exhaust tips replace the Mustang GT's standard 3 inch tips. Although side (quarter) window louvers (as shown in picture) are not standard, they are added by owners because they are similar to those on the 1968 Mustang fastback.|$|E
5000|$|In overall terms 1963 Cadillac was {{essentially}} the same as last year. Exterior changes imparted a bolder and longer look. Hoods and <b>deck</b> <b>lids</b> were redesigned.

25|$|On {{passenger}} cars, the CHMSL may {{be placed}} above the back glass, {{affixed to the}} vehicle's interior just inside the back glass, {{or it may be}} integrated into the vehicle's <b>deck</b> <b>lid</b> or into a spoiler. Other specialised fitments are sometimes seen; the Jeep Wrangler and Land Rover Freelander have the CHMSL on a stalk fixed to the spare wheel carrier. Trucks, vans and commercial vehicles sometimes have the CHMSL mounted to the trailing edge of the vehicle's roof. The CHMSL is required by regulations worldwide to be centred laterally on the vehicle, though UN Regulation 48 permits lateral offset of up to 15cm if the vehicle's lateral centre is not coincident with a fixed body panel, but instead separates movable components such as doors. The Renault Master and Ford Transit van, for example, uses a laterally offset CHMSL for this reason. The height of the CHMSL is also regulated, in absolute terms and with respect to the mounting height of the vehicle's conventional left and right stop lamps. Depending on the left and right lamps' height, the lower edge of the CHMSL may be just above the left and right lamps' upper edge.|$|E
25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and <b>deck</b> <b>lid</b> with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated cruise control switch, a recessed trunk pull-down handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{aluminum}} in automotive applications is expanding. Aluminum offers a lower-weight alternative to steel, potentially increasing {{the efficiency of}} vehicles. However, the application {{of aluminum}} has been only in select areas of use, most notably cast aluminum in the engine, transmission, and wheels. Other areas offer the potential for growth that could significantly expand the amount of aluminum used in vehicles. Cost is the main barrier to increased aluminum use. Related to cost are aluminum production technologies that are not yet advanced enough to produce aluminum components at low enough price points for aluminum to compete with traditional automotive materials. Today's technologies require higher-priced alloys {{to be used for}} the components (e. g., closure panels), or have higher costs for needed processes (e. g., welding). In addition, new designs (e. g., spaceframes) are not well established for widespread use. R&D efforts are continuing to close these gaps. The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) is helping to fund certain R&D projects that could provide breakthroughs in lowering costs for aluminum. This paper describes the current state of aluminum applications in vehicles, including its market penetration and opportunities. It also examines the cost structure of aluminum [...] from mining to final component use. By examining these factors, an evaluation of whether current aluminum technology is mature enough for specific applications is made. Each major aluminum processing step is then reviewed to identify major cost or technology barriers as well as R&D needed to respond to those barriers. For each step, the report provides a discussion of DOE's programmatic role in reducing cost and technological barriers and DOE's Light Weight Materials program support for the overall R&D needs in the industry. The evaluation embodied in this report finds that aluminum has successfully penetrated the automotive market, largely (> 75 %) in the form of castings. Aluminum sheet of the proper alloy is still too expensive to penetrate significantly except for components where lower weight has extra value (e. g., large hoods or <b>deck</b> <b>lids).</b> The cost of auto body sheet averages above $ 1. 30 /lb, 30 % above what the auto industry has said is required for economic competitiveness. Further research is needed to either lower the cost of the alloys currently used for body sheet, or to develop methods to use less expensive alloys. Joining technologies need to be improved to lower their cost while improving quality. Extruded components have potential but will make the most significant contribution if spaceframe designs are developed for high-volume automobile markets. Aluminum has the potential to significantly reduce the weight of vehicles, improving fuel efficiency while maintaining other desirable attributes. Federally funded research contributes to this goal...|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, Honda {{introduced}} the NSX's biggest performance upgrades {{for all its}} worldwide markets. Engine displacement increased from 3.0 L to 3.2 L using a thinner fiber-reinforced metal (FRM) cylinder liner. The exhaust manifold was reconfigured and made of stainless steel header pipes rather than a cast-iron manifold for improved performance and lighter weight. The increased flow from this new configuration was a key contributor to the 20 additional horsepower drawn from the new engine. This revised 3.2 L C32B engine gave it slightly more rated power: from [...] to [...] while torque increased from 285 Nm to 305 Nm (manual transmission only). The net result increased the horsepower to weight ratio of the NSX by 7%. The 4-speed automatic model retained its 3.0 L engine and 252 hp power output. Another big change was {{the adoption of a}} 6-speed manual transmission with closer gear ratios and the addition of 3rd to 4th gear dual cone synchronizers. To handle the new engine's added torque and power the small diameter twin-disc clutch system of the 5-speed was replaced by a dual-mass low-inertia single disc clutch system. To offset the weight increase of the new 6-speed transmission and larger brake rotors, which were upped from 11.1 in to 11.732 in, key body parts were made with a new aluminum alloy that was up to 50% stronger allowing thinner lighter material {{to be used in the}} doors, fenders, and front and rear <b>deck</b> <b>lids</b> without any sacrifice of strength. Using this hi-strength alloy the net curb weight increase, despite adding many improvements, was only 22 lbs. Other notable changes included a keyless entry system and vehicle immobilizer system. The combination of slightly increased power and torque and a 6-speed gearbox, with ratios optimized to improve straight-line acceleration, produced better performance numbers over previous models than the modest increases would suggest. Motor Trend and Road and Track (Feb 97) tests of 3.2L 6-speed equipped NSX-T (Targa) roofed cars produced 0-60 mph times of 4.8 and 5.0 seconds and quarter-mile times of 13.3s and 13.5s respectively. 0-60 mph times dropped to as low as 4.5 seconds using a 3.2L hard top coupe model as recorded by Car and Driver in their August 1998 0-150-0 issue. That NSX proved to be the fastest ever tested in North America. When Car and Driver tested the 1999 Zanardi special edition coupe a year later it produced a 4.8s 0-60 and a 13.2s quarter-mile. Although magazine tests for the 02+ models were rare Honda apparently kept improving the engine as Sports and Exotic Car magazine did a farewell article on a 2005 NSX-T and recorded a 0-60 time of 4.7s and a 13.1s quarter-mile.|$|R

He would go on to finish second in the next two races at Las Vegas and Phoenix, which allowed him to take the point lead {{for the first time in}} his career. Larson picked up his second career pole and earned his second career win in the Auto Club 400, furthering his points lead. A 17th place finish at Martinsville Speedway hurt him, but he still maintained a four-point lead over Chase Elliott. In the 2017 O'Reilly Auto Parts 500, Larson rebounded from struggles early to finish 2nd. [...] Larson picked up his third career pole at Michigan and then he led 96 laps to get his third career win in the FireKeepers Casino 400 holding off Chase Elliott, just like when he won in August. At the Kentucky race, Larson started at the rear of the field after he was unable to set a qualifying time as he was stuck in inspection. He finished second in the race, but lost his points lead to Martin Truex Jr. when he was penalized 35 points for an improper rear brake cooling assembly; crew chief Chad Johnston was suspended for three races and Tony Lunders took his place. A week later, Larson won the pole at Loudon's Overton's 301, but was forced to surrender it to Truex after failing post-qualifying inspection for an unapproved rear <b>deck</b> fin <b>lid.</b> Larson won again at Michigan in August's Pure Michigan 400; on a restart with two laps to go, he restarted fourth, but made a four-wide pass on Truex, Erik Jones and Matt Kenseth as they entered turn one. Upon passing Truex, Larson pulled away to win his third consecutive race at the track.|$|R

2500|$|From 1927 through 1934 all Cadillac series offered Fleetwood {{bodies as}} an option. Thereafter Cadillac became more {{selective}} in offering Fleetwood bodies on its series and by 1938 {{the only way}} to obtain a Fleetwood bodied car was by buying a Cadillac Series 75 or 90, as even the Cadillac Sixty Special had a Fisher body in its inaugural year. [...] The Fleetwood script and crest would not appear on the exterior of any Cadillac until the 1947 model year when it appeared on the rear <b>deck</b> <b>lid</b> of the Sixty Special. By 1952 it also appeared on the rear <b>deck</b> <b>lid</b> of the Series 75. In 1957 the Cadillac Series 70 Eldorado Brougham joined the Sixty Special and the Series 75 as the only Cadillac models with Fleetwood bodies although Fleetwood script or crests did not appear anywhere on the exterior of the car. This marked the first time in 20 years that a Fleetwood bodied car was paired with the Brougham name. Ironically, when production of the Eldorado Brougham was shifted in 1959 from the Cadillac Fleetwood plant in Detroit to Pininfarina in Turin, Italy, only then did it acquire Fleetwood wheel discs and doorsill moldings, presumably because the design work and final touches were still being done by Fleetwood. Production of the Eldorado Brougham ceased in 1961 but in 1963 the Eldorado Biarritz also became Fleetwood bodied and immediately acquired Fleetwood crests on its rear quarters and Fleetwood rocker panel moldings. Interestingly the 1963 Eldorado Biarritz was also the first Fleetwood bodied convertible since the Cadillac Series 75 stopped offering 4-door and 2-door convertible body styles and production of the Cadillac Series 90 ceased in 1941.|$|E
