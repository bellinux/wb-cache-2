Places like Saint Joseph's in North Dakota became {{established}} winter places that the Métis would go to. Later, declining buffalo herds led to the Métis migrating <b>farther</b> <b>and</b> <b>farther</b> <b>away.</b> In the 1860s, living conditions, including crop conditions, were so severe that the Hudson's Bay Company had to step in to help avoid starvation.|$|E
2500|$|Also, {{for popular}} values {{that might have}} many requests, the load in the storer nodes is diminished by having a {{retriever}} store this value in some node near, but outside of, the k closest ones. This new storing is called a cache. In this way the value is stored <b>farther</b> <b>and</b> <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> from the key, depending on the quantity of requests. This allows popular searches to find a storer more quickly. Because the value is returned from nodes {{farther away from the}} key, this alleviates possible [...] "hot spots". Caching nodes will drop the value after a certain time depending on their distance from the key.|$|E
2500|$|.....food {{was hidden}} {{and only one}} individual, named Belle, {{in a group of}} {{chimpanzees}} was informed of the location. Belle was eager to lead the group to the food but when one chimpanzee, named Rock, began to refuse to share the food, Belle changed her behaviour. She began to sit on the food until Rock was far away, then she would uncover it quickly and eat it. Rock figured this out though and began to push her {{out of the way and}} take the food from under her. Belle then sat <b>farther</b> <b>and</b> <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> waiting for Rock to look away before she moved towards the food. In an attempt to speed the process up, Rock looked away until Belle began to run for the food. On several occasions he would even walk away, acting disinterested, and then suddenly spin around and run towards Belle just as she uncovered the food." ...|$|E

An example {{occurred during the}} 1929 Grand Banks earthquake that struck the continental slope {{off the coast of}} Newfoundland. Minutes later, transatlantic telephone cables began breaking sequentially, <b>farther</b> <b>and</b> <b>farther</b> downslope, <b>away</b> from the epicenter. Twelve cables were snapped in a total of 28 places. Exact times and locations were recorded for each break. Investigators suggested that a 60-mile-per-hour (100km/h) submarine landslide or turbidity current of water saturated sediments swept 400 miles (600km) down the continental slope from the earthquake’s epicenter, snapping the cables as it passed.|$|R

The biggest and most advanced Yakan coastal settlement was located on the northeastern shores of Basilan, in Lamitan, and far from the usual routes of pirate raiders on their way to Zamboanga from Sulu and Maluso. The Yakans were understandably wary of the Tausugs who proceeded to occupy much of the lowlands of the island's southeast coast, and have remained hostile to the Tausug kingdom that eventually flourished in the area.|$|R

5000|$|Within {{minutes after}} the 1929 Grand Banks {{earthquake}} occurred {{off the coast of}} Newfoundland, transatlantic telephone cables began breaking sequentially, <b>farther</b> <b>and</b> <b>farther</b> downslope, <b>away</b> from the epicenter. Twelve cables were snapped in a total of 28 places. Exact times and locations were recorded for each break. Investigators suggested that an estimated 60 mile per hour (100 km/h) submarine landslide or turbidity current of water saturated sediments swept 400 miles (600 km) down the continental slope from the earthquake’s epicenter, snapping the cables as it passed. [...] Subsequent research of this event have shown that continental slope sediment failures mostly occurred below 650 meter water depth. [...] The slumping that occurred in shallow waters (5-25 meters) passed down slope into turbidity currents that evolved ignitively. The turbidity currents had sustained flow for many hours due to the delayed retrogressive failure and transformation of debris flows into turbidity currents through hydraulic jumps.|$|R
