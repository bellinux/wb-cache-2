5|$|Next, the metamorphosed Precambrian {{basement}} rocks were uplifted and {{a nearly}} 500-million-year-long {{gap in the}} geologic record, a major unconformity, affected the region. Geologists do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the eroded sediment that must have overlain the complex, but they do know that regional uplift was responsible; the area was originally {{below the surface of}} a shallow sea.|$|E
5|$|Kirk {{decides that}} they need to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the Valiant, and the Enterprise crosses the edge of the galaxy where it {{encounters}} a strange barrier which damages the ship's systems and warp drive, forcing a retreat. At the same time, nine crewmembers are killed and both helmsman Gary Mitchell and ship's psychiatrist Dr. Elizabeth Dehner are knocked unconscious by the barrier's effect. When he awakens, Mitchell's eyes glow silver, and he begins to display remarkable psychic powers.|$|E

5|$|The {{fate of the}} {{original}} letter given to Bixby is unknown. William A. Bixby, a son of Oliver, told The New York Times in an August 9, 1925 interview {{that he did not}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the letter after his grandmother received it, though he doubted it still survived. A few days later, William's sister, Mrs. Towers told the Boston Herald that she also did not know the letter's fate but speculated Bixby may have torn it up, resenting that it incorrectly said five of her sons had been killed. William's son, Arthur March Bixby, told the New York Sun in 1949 that he recalled his father telling him that she had angrily destroyed the letter after receiving it.|$|E
25|$|Emma {{has decided}} to help Elsa search for Anna. The {{necklace}} leads them to the beach, but Anna is not there. Emma explains that magic is not always accurate, and {{that she needs to}} accept that Anna may no longer even be alive. Elsa weeps and wishes that she could <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Anna and that she could see her again. Suddenly the necklace begins to glow. The necklace is revealed to be the Wishing Star.

25|$|Stanley later {{questions}} Blanche {{about her}} earlier marriage. Blanche had married {{when she was}} very young, but her husband died, leaving her widowed and alone. The memory of her dead husband causes Blanche some obvious distress. Stanley, worried {{that he has been}} cheated out of an inheritance, demands to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Belle Reve, once a large plantation and the DuBois family home. Blanche hands over all the documents pertaining to Belle Reve. While looking at the papers, Stanley notices a bundle of letters that Blanche emotionally proclaims are personal love letters from her dead husband.

She learns that Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) and Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Carl and tells Roxy the truth, who accepts Ronnie's {{explanation}} of the incident. Carl's family put pressure on Ronnie as they ask about Carl's whereabouts. When they realise that Ronnie {{has something to do}} with his disappearance, Carl's brother, Adam White (Ben Wigzell), snatches Lola Pearce's (Danielle Harold) daughter, Lexi Pearce, while she is in the care of Ronnie and Roxy. Ronnie and Phil track her down and Ronnie hires Aleks Shirovs (Kristian Kiehling) to beat Adam up. The following month, Ronnie accidentally runs Lola over, in the same spot where Danielle died. Ronnie is full of remorse for her actions and Lola soon forgives her, realising that Ronnie never intended to harm her.|$|E
25|$|Emma, Hook {{and their}} guest return to see Rumplestiltskin {{in the hopes}} that he can open the time portal, but instead he tells them that only they can re-open it because only the people who came through the portal can re-open it, but they need to wield magic. Rumple gives Emma a wand and tells her to open the portal if she has magic, but she doesn't think she can. Rumple decides he’d rather forget {{everything}} he’s learned so as not to alter his future, then he sends Emma and Hook to a dark vault where he keeps dangerous and unpredictable magic, where their Storybrooke outfits are restored. Hook says that Emma still has some magic in her and after seeing what happened to her parents and realizing everything Henry did to bring her to Storybrooke, she's ready to return home. Hook and Emma then notice the wand lights up with magic and open up the portal, allowing Hook and the woman to escape first. Before she can leave, Rumple holds on to Emma and demands to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Baelfire/Neal. Emma tells him what happened, then she begs him not to take away the fact he died a hero. Rumplestiltskin drinks the forgetting potion and lets go of Emma where she is pulled into the portal, which sends her, Hook, and the woman back to Storybrooke.|$|E

500|$|The full {{procedure}} for handling payments of Social Security and Medicare taxes, {{as well as}} state and federal unemployment insurance premiums, for household and child-care help remained quite complex, however, and over the following two decades, self-help articles were published with titles such as [...] "How to Avoid Your Very Own Nannygate" [...] and [...] "Time to Come Clean" [...] and with admonitions like [...] "we all <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Kimba Wood and Zoë Baird." ...|$|E
500|$|CBS senior {{journalist}} Danna Walker stated, [...] "There is {{criticism that}} it is only a story because she is a pretty blonde—and white—and it is criticism that journalists are taking to heart and looking elsewhere for other stories. But it is a big story because it is an American girl who went off on an adventure and didn't come back. It is a huge mystery, it is something people can identify with." [...] Good Morning America anchor Chris Cuomo was unapologetic of his program's extensive coverage of the Holloway case. [...] "I don't believe it's my role to judge what people want to watch… If they say, 'I want to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> this girl'… I want to help them find out." ...|$|E
500|$|One of the {{consequences}} of all the uncertainty behind the scenes was Chrissie's final fate, which was left largely unresolved. Oberman revealed in July 2009 that originally there were plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline [...] "was put on hold {{and then there was a}} whole different team involved after that. I know that if they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, [...] And I'd moved straight on to Doctor Who, too. Nobody was available until the following year, by which point Michelle was in Bionic Woman, I was pregnant and Kim was in Cabaret." [...] Because of this [...] "I never felt it was finished off and I would have loved to have wrapped it up." [...] She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. [...] "I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline because I love the character and I do feel that she was left in limbo. To <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> her would be great. Even if she went back to say goodbye or wanted to make peace with Sam. Or maybe we could see her in prison?" ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the script}} {{that was sent}} to {{prospective}} actors and directors, Lester and Angela had sex; {{by the time of}} shooting, Ball had rewritten the scene to the final version. Ball initially rebuffed counsel from others that he change the script, feeling they were being puritanical; the final impetus to alter the scene came from DreamWorks' then-president Walter Parkes. He convinced Ball by indicating that in Greek mythology, the hero [...] "has a moment of epiphany before tragedy occurs". Ball later said his anger when writing the first draft had blinded him to the idea that Lester needed to refuse sex with Angela to complete his emotional journey—to achieve redemption. Jinks and Cohen asked Ball not to alter the scene right away, as they felt it would be inappropriate to make changes to the script before a director had been hired. Early drafts also included a flashback to Col. Fitts' service in the Marines, a sequence that unequivocally established his homosexual leanings. In love with another Marine, Col. Fitts sees the man die and comes to believe that he is being punished for the [...] "sin" [...] of being gay. Ball removed the sequence because it did not fit the structure {{of the rest of the}} film—Col. Fitts was the only character to have a flashback—and because it removed the element of surprise from Col. Fitts' later pass at Lester. Ball said he had to write it for his own benefit to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Col. Fitts, though all that remained in later drafts was subtext.|$|E
500|$|However, in January 2012, Heigl {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that she has asked the producers if she could return to the show to give closure to Izzie's storyline: [...] "I've told them I want to ," [...] she said. [...] "I really, really, really want to see where [...] is. I just want to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." [...] She later {{went on to say that}} she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E

2500|$|So did Fearchar {{appear from}} nowhere as a [...] "novus homo"? The facts are {{that we do}} not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the Mormaerdom of Ross after the death, in 1168, of the last known Mormaer, Malcolm MacHeth. We might compare Ross with other Mormaerdoms, such as Lennox and Carrick, in which these {{apparently}} new Mormaerdoms were merely de iure royal grants to native lords who already possessed kinship leadership and de facto status as provincial rulers. In this view, conferring this style was simply an act of harnessing organic Gaelic power structures to the political, terminological and ideological framework of the regnum Scottorum.|$|E
2500|$|The first edition, Loose Change, {{suggested}} {{that there was an}} unusual device (which the filmmakers refer to as a [...] "pod") under the fuselage of the plane that struck the South Tower of the World Trade Center. The [...] "pod" [...] was presented as evidence that the planes involved in the attack were replaced with remote-controlled drones. Another film [...] delves into the topic of the commercial airlines being military airlines with [...] "pods". Official flight records were also presented as evidence that the aircraft involved are still in active service, though it is stated that the producers do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the passengers of the flights.
