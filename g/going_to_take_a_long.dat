6000|$|One {{day it was}} rumoured in {{the works}} that Mr Frederick was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> holiday. Since his {{appointment}} to the chief charge, Fred had taken few holidays, and {{had worked so hard}} that he began to have a careworn aspect, so the people said they were [...] "glad to hear it; no one in the works deserved a long holiday better than he." [...] But the people were not a little puzzled when Bob Bowie, the office porter, told them that their young master was going away for three months to chase the sun! ...|$|E
6000|$|It was a {{very fine}} November day, and the Miss Musgroves came through the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say, that they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> walk, and {{therefore}} concluded Mary could not like to go with them; and when Mary immediately replied, with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, [...] "Oh, yes, I should like to join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;" [...] Anne felt persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely what they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce, of everything being to be communicated, and everything being to be done together, however undesired and inconvenient. She tried to dissuade Mary from going, but in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept the Miss Musgroves' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise, as she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening the interference in any plan of their own.|$|E

5000|$|I didn't {{think it}} was going to be simple, and it's going to take perhaps a generation, two generations really to turn the tide I think, but I do believe it will be turned. It's not just us, there are many people now taking up this work, and as the burden, the stress which is largely because of {{increasing}} population - in the last 50 years the population of India has tripled, probably the population of Vrindavan has multiplied by more than that - so that creates huge pressures, and it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to change those, but as the pressure increases so does the urgency to find a solution.|$|E

5000|$|We Are the Fallen began forming when Moody had {{discussions with}} Evanescence band members Gray and LeCompt about the band {{moving in a}} {{different}} direction than originally planned. Moody felt something had to change in order to preserve their style of music and left due to [...] "creative differences" [...] with Amy Lee, the band's co-founder and frontwoman. Years later when Gray and LeCompt also left the band, Moody reached out to them in attempts to continue where they had left off in 2003 with Fallen, recruiting O'Brien in the process. The band held auditions looking for a lead singer in New York City and Moody feared that the search for the band's [...] "soulmate" [...] was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time due to the exhaustive process. Moody's roommate showed him videos online of Smithson performing her rendition of Evanescence's [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] which was coincidentally the song all singers used to audition for Moody and the band. Ben was then introduced to Smithson who was developing a solo album after the tour with American Idol.|$|E
5000|$|In 2015, Bezos further {{discussed}} {{the motivation for}} his spaceflight-related business when he announced a new orbital launch vehicle under development for late-2010s first flight.He indicated that his ambitions in space are not location dependent—Mars, Lunar, asteroidal, etc.—"we want to go everywhere, significantly lower launch costs. Our number-one opponent is gravity. ... The vision for Blue is pretty simple. We want to see millions of people {{living and working in}} space. That's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. I think it's a worthwhile goal."In 2016, Bezos opened up the Blue rocket design and manufacturing facility to journalists for the first time, and gave extensive interviews that included an articulation of his vision for space and for Blue Origin. Bezos sees space as being [...] "chock full of resources" [...] and foresees a [...] "Great Inversion" [...] where there will emerge [...] "space commercialization that stretches out for hundreds of years, leading to an era when millions of people would be living and working in space." [...] He sees both energy and heavy manufacturing occurring in space, having the effect of reduced pollution on Earth, in effect reducing the probability that something [...] "bad happens to the Earth."Bezos has said that he is trying to change the fundamental cost structure of accessing space.|$|E
30|$|The {{analysis}} and quantification {{of the behaviors}} and relationships {{of the people in}} the social structure can be performed using social network analysis. We can calculate social metrics to understand influences, centralities, and communities to predict the information diffusion in the network [10, 15, 17, 18, 24, 25]. As we understand the social network characteristics given the calculated metrics, we become able to identify which individuals will be reached by the information spread. It enables us to say whether it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> or a short time. For example, an information being propagated by a very influential node within a specific time interval can reach more nodes in the network than if it were propagated by a non-influential network node. The social structure plays an important role in the temporal behavior of objects [8, 24]. This work differs from previous work in that besides using the temporal behavior of the studied object, it incorporates the social structure of the individuals related to this object into the prediction models.|$|E

40|$|Transcription begins]:Wednsday [sic] 1700 Dearest Dottie, Please {{excuse the}} paper, honey, {{but this is}} all I’ve got, {{the end of the}} month you know. Well, tomorrow’s payday, thank goodness. Darling, I love you. Gosh just as I wrote that they fired the cannon for retreat. That’s the kind of an ovation I like. You see,—you rate around here, beautiful. Steve won’t be able to make it this weekend, he’s not allowed to have anyone take over for him, so he’ll be too late. Anyway I don’t like double dates anymore, {{although}} when I’m with you I don’t know or care who’s around. When we’re together, honey, it’s like a dream, and you’re the only one in it. It’s just good to be with you Dottie, and I never felt about any other girl that way. There always seemed to be an ulterior motive for my being with anyone else. With you it’s just that I love you, and I want to be near you. I know that no matter how long we’re together or apart it will always be that way—always. Tonight Steve and I and a bunch of the boys are going to the movies to see “Frenchman’s Creek. ” The band is going to play tonight too. It’s a swell outfit, they have Don Cornell, who used to be with Sammy Kaye, for a vocalist. He’s pretty good. I’m glad the pictures are ready. Where are you going to have the ones taken Thursday night? Friday I won’t get off until around five or later, the way things look now it will probably be later, for we might take that Cross Country to Williamsport that afternoon. I’ll get home as soon as possible, darling, and call you when I do. Lonnie must have died a horrible death, but it’s better that way, then [sic] being a prisoner of the Japanese. I don’t think I’d ever let them take me prisoner. You have no idea darling, what fanatics they are, they just don’t seem human, do they? That’s why it’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to beat them. But we will darling, and everything that it has cost us in blood, sweat, and tears will be worth it. Always remember that honey. What’s this surprise you have for me this weekend? Christmas isn’t here yet, angel. You’re so sweet, and I love you so much. Today I flew instruments for an hour and a quarter, then the ship began to ice up so we were forced back to the field. This weather is really bad now. It’s snowing up here. I feel that every flake that falls could mean another minute that we’re apart;—and we have so little time left. Just three weekends and Christmas, but we’re lucky we have that, I guess. Give my best to your family, honey. I love you more every day, my darling. All my love, Judd[Transcription ends...|$|E
