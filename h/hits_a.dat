5|$|In seven years, Australian Crawl {{had sold}} {{over a million}} records in Australia, with five of its albums and an EP {{reaching}} the Australian Top 5 Album Charts, two {{of which had been}} No. 1 <b>hits.</b> <b>A</b> cumulative total of eleven weeks at Number 1 on the Albums Charts places them equal fourth for Australian groups behind Skyhooks, The Seekers and Midnight Oil.|$|E
5|$|The flyout: as {{described}} above, recorded against a batter who <b>hits</b> <b>a</b> {{ball in the}} air that is caught by a fielder, whether in fair territory or foul territory, before it lands, whether or not the batter has run.|$|E
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>hit,</b> <b>an</b> error, {{a double}} play, another <b>hit,</b> <b>a</b> steal, and a forced out--these told Wayne's dogged, {{unsuccessful}} {{trial for the}} winning run.|$|R
50|$|When in-hand, not <b>hitting</b> <b>an</b> object ball or cushion out of baulk before <b>hitting</b> <b>a</b> ball in baulk.|$|R
50|$|For Team Liffey, Matt <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> perfect {{drive and}} Andy <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> stellar long iron shot to 7 feet, and Mark made the eagle putt. Then it was Team Straffan's turn. Joe also <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> perfect drive, and Julien <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> decent {{approach}} to 30 feet. Nina's eagle putt missed short right, so Team Straffan makes a birdie but they lose the challenge, and Team Liffey has a 1-0 lead.|$|R
5|$|The ground out: {{recorded}} {{against a}} batter (in this case, batter-runner) who <b>hits</b> <b>a</b> ball that lands in fair territory which, before the batter-runner can reach first base, is retrieved by a fielder who touches first base while holding the ball or relays {{it to another}} fielder who touches first base while holding the ball.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} player's turn batting or plate {{appearance is}} complete when the player reaches base, <b>hits</b> <b>a</b> home run, makes an out, or <b>hits</b> <b>a</b> ball {{that results in}} the team's third out, {{even if it is}} recorded against a teammate. On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game. Children's games often have more liberal substitution rules.|$|E
5|$|Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) {{talks to}} the others {{to try to get}} a sense of Shane's actions. He later speaks to Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) about Shane's erratic behavior, his {{suspicion}} that Shane had killed Otis to escape a walker horde, and his fear Shane may kill someone else soon. As Beth's condition worsen, Lori asks Daryl (Norman Reedus) to drive into town to check on Rick, but Daryl refuses, saying his days of searching for someone are over. Lori opts to go alone, but en route, her car <b>hits</b> <b>a</b> walker and is overturned.|$|E
5000|$|Numbers can {{be closed}} in the {{standard}} fashion i.e. <b>hitting</b> <b>a</b> single 3 times, <b>hitting</b> <b>a</b> double and <b>a</b> single, <b>hitting</b> <b>a</b> triple, etc. [...] A closing variation, when using only the numbers 1-20, is <b>a</b> single <b>hit</b> on <b>a</b> number closes it out. [...] Standard scoring is used, i.e. a triple 17 is worth 51 points.|$|R

50|$|In tennis, {{there are}} 3 main ways to execute an {{effective}} passing shot: <b>hitting</b> <b>a</b> fast return, <b>hitting</b> <b>an</b> angled ball, and bluffing.|$|R
5|$|Furious, Presto {{tries to}} attack Alec, {{but in an}} act to defend himself, Alec puts an offstage ladder into the wizard hat, and Presto is hit between his legs. Presto {{attempts}} to hit Alec with it, but it misses and <b>hits</b> <b>a</b> backstage door, and Presto ends up getting pushed across the stage. Presto antagonizes Alec again, covering the carrot with a cloth before smashing it into a pulp {{with a piece of}} the ladder. Alec furiously retaliates by aiming the opening of the wizard's hat towards an electrical socket which Presto's fingers go into, shocking Presto into dancing wildly to bluegrass music.|$|E
5|$|In {{the small}} town of Sam Dent, British Columbia, a school bus <b>hits</b> <b>a</b> patch of ice, runs through a barrier and crashes into a lake, killing 14 children. The grieving parents are {{approached}} by an out-of-town lawyer, Mitchell Stephens, who is haunted by his dysfunctional relationship with his drug-addict daughter. Stephens persuades the reluctant parents and bus driver Dolores Driscoll to file a class action lawsuit against the town and bus company for damages, arguing that the accident is a result of negligence in constructing the barrier or the bus.|$|E
5|$|Kershaw won {{his first}} major league game against the Washington Nationals on July 27, 2008. He pitched six-plus shutout innings, {{allowing}} four <b>hits,</b> <b>a</b> walk, and he struck out five. Kershaw finished his rookie season 5–5, with a 4.26 ERA in 22 games (21 starts). He also pitched two innings out of the bullpen for the Dodgers in the 2008 National League Championship Series (NLCS) against the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|E
5000|$|Going {{into the}} last game of the 1977 season Perlozzo's teammate, Rod Carew, had 99 RBIs. Perlozzo started the game at shortstop in place of Roy Smalley, and just as Perlozzo was about to bat {{for the first time}} in the game, manager Gene Mauch grabbed him by the arm and said, [...] "I want you to go up there and <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> triple, right now, this at-bat. You <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> triple, understand?" [...] Perlozzo did <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> triple, and Carew <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> single to gain his 100th RBI of the season.|$|R
50|$|On May 16, 2017, Harper <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> {{home run}} at PNC Park, which meant {{in his career}} he had <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> home run in all 15 National League ballparks.|$|R

5|$|The game {{contains}} {{a variety of}} elements that both aid and hinder the player's progress through the waves. At his disposal, Jones has TNT, guns, swords, hats for extra lives, jewels for extra time and his classic whip. Opposing him are bats, rats, snakes, spiders and an endless supply of Thugee servants. In addition, if Jones lands {{in any of the}} lava pits, crashes a mine cart or <b>hits</b> <b>a</b> boulder or spike trap, he loses one life.|$|E

50|$|In {{the bottom}} of the seventh, with two outs and runners on first and third, Dustin Pedroia <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> RBI single off Grant Balfour to finally get the Red Sox on the board. The next batter, David Ortiz, <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> three-run home run to right field, ending a postseason home run drought of 61 at-bats. In the eighth inning, J. D. Drew <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> two-run homer to right field off Dan Wheeler. Later, Coco Crisp <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> RBI single to right field to score Mark Kotsay from second to tie the game. In the ninth inning, after J. P. Howell retired the first two Boston batters, Kevin Youkilis <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> ground ball to third base. Longoria scooped the ball, but his throw was off, and bounced into the stands, {{allowing}} Youkilis to reach second. After an intentional walk to Jason Bay, Drew <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> single over the head of right fielder Gabe Gross to win the game.|$|R
2500|$|In 1915, Joseph P. Derby <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> {{home run}} off the right field wall, and became the only know amateur {{baseball}} player believed to <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> ball completely out of Washington's Griffith Stadium.|$|R
5|$|The {{left-hand}} panel shows {{a fighter}} plane firing a rocket that, in the right-hand panel, <b>hits</b> <b>a</b> second plane which explodes in flames. Lichtenstein conceived the image from several comic-book panels. He transformed his primary source, a panel from a 1962 war comic book, by presenting it as a diptych while altering {{the relationship of}} the graphical and narrative elements. Whaam! is regarded for the temporal, spatial and psychological integration of its two panels. The painting's title is integral to the action and impact of the painting, and displayed in large onomatopoeia in the right panel.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{gameplay}} issues when the player takes {{their turn to}} bat. The AI is not developed and, when the player <b>hits</b> <b>a</b> pitch, it nearly always takes the longest possible route to the ball, making runs easier to score. It also lacks the capability to throw out a runner who is returning to a base (instead of advancing) or perform a double play after catching a fly ball. Furthermore, the batter can only move vertically, not horizontally, in the batter's box.|$|E
5|$|A {{visit by}} Dahlia Brinkley, the only Springfield Elementary {{graduate}} ever to enter an Ivy League college, gives Lisa a severe inferiority complex {{because she is}} involved in very few extracurricular activities. When Ned Flanders resigns as coach of Bart's Little League team, the Springfield Isotots, Lisa seizes the chance to extend her résumé and takes the position. Since she knows nothing about baseball, she seeks advice from the patrons of Moe's Tavern, who direct her to Professor Frink and his scientific colleagues. She learns about sabermetrics from them and uses this science to organize the Isotots' strategy; as a result, their record quickly improves and they rise in the league standings. However, Bart eventually rebels against her management, saying that she has taken all {{the fun out of}} the game, and <b>hits</b> <b>a</b> home run despite her orders to let the pitcher walk him. The Isotots win the game, but Lisa throws Bart off the team for his insubordination.|$|E
50|$|June 1, 2010: Pilots win 6-5 {{over the}} Fargo-Moorhead Redhawks. Richard Mercado <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> two-run homer, and Andre Marshall <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> walk off solo home run {{to seal the}} game for the Pilots.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the more}} famous no pitch calls was when ten time All-Star Randy Johnson <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> bird with a pitch. The ball was near the plate once it <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> flying bird.|$|R

5|$|Although {{there is}} no stand-your-ground law, the fact that {{necessary}} defense (unlike utmost necessity) {{is not subject to}} subsidiarity means that there is also no duty to retreat. The mere fact that a defender uses a weapon against unarmed attacker {{does not mean that the}} defense is disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to the manner of the attack and the proportionality of defense does not depend on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity of the attack, but on the manner in which the weapon is used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, notwithstanding if the slug <b>hits</b> <b>a</b> leg artery and the attacker bleeds to death).|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of an inning during which runs are scored after an error or passed ball, the official scorer attempts to recreate {{the events of the}} inning without the errors or passed balls. If in the official scorer's opinion a run would not have scored without the defensive lapses, then the run is unearned. If the scorer believes that a run would have scored anyway, the run is earned and charged to the pitcher. In one basic example, if the first batter reaches by an error, the second batter <b>hits</b> <b>a</b> home run, and the next three batters strike out, then one of the two runs which were scored are unearned. There are rules and restrictions which govern this general guideline.|$|E
5|$|Gran Trak 10 is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari through its subsidiary Cyan Engineering, and released by Atari in May 1974. In the game, a single player drives a car along a race track, viewed from above, avoiding walls of pylons {{and trying to}} pass as many checkpoints as possible before time runs out. The game is controlled with a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals, and a gear stick, and the car crashes and spins if it <b>hits</b> <b>a</b> pylon. Gran Trak 10 began development in fall of 1973; it was initially designed by Larry Emmons of Cyan, with the mechanical design handled by Eigen Systems, though after several design and production problems were uncovered during an initial small production run in March 1974 the design was overhauled by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, with wider distribution beginning in May. The game's circuits include possibly the first instance of integrated circuit-based read-only memory, rather than graphics storied in diodes, which thereafter became the standard for arcade games.|$|E

50|$|The next semi-final {{match was}} between Roberts and Vader. Vader {{dominated}} Roberts with a Body Press and a Running Splash. Roberts booted Vader and <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> Swinging Knee Lift. Roberts tried {{to finish the}} match by attempting a DDT on Vader but Vader backed him into the corner and tried to <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> Short-arm Clothesline. Roberts countered and <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> Short-arm Clothesline of his own. Roberts ran through the ropes but Vader <b>hit</b> him with <b>a</b> Running Splash and tried to charge Roberts into the corner. Roberts avoided the charge and tried to <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> DDT on Vader but Vader used the referee as a human shield to prevent himself from getting a DDT. As a result of using the referee, Vader was disqualified. Vader assaulted Roberts after the match and injured him by <b>hitting</b> <b>a</b> Corner Slingshot Splash which he calls Vader Bomb.|$|R
