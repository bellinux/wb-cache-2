5|$|Due to {{problems}} {{with some of}} the new features, such as the Bulleid chain-driven valve gear, sixty locomotives were rebuilt by British Railways during the late 1950s. This produced a design highly similar to the rebuilt Merchant Navy class. The classes operated until July 1967, when the last steam locomotives on the Southern Region were withdrawn. Although most were scrapped, twenty locomotives found new <b>homes</b> <b>on</b> heritage railways in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Damage {{was also}} heavy on Bimini island, where heavy {{rainfall}} and powerful storm surge damaged homes, trees, and utility poles. On the island, the hurricane severely damaged {{a hotel and}} eight waterfront <b>homes.</b> <b>On</b> Abaco, eight homes and a governmental clinic were destroyed. The storm surge destroyed a government dock and caused flooding and beach erosion near the coast. New Providence and the Berry Islands also reported minor wind damage from Wilma, primarily to downed trees and power lines. Throughout the Bahamas, Wilma damaged public infrastructure such as schools, roads, health clinics, and electrical systems.|$|E
5|$|Further west, Typhoon Sudal {{intensified}} {{quickly as}} it moved through the Caroline Islands and later Yap state. On Ulithi, a wind gust of 132km/h (82mph) was reported, and 6.34inches of rainfall occurred in a 24‑hour period. High waves of over 5m (18ft) struck the island, causing severe beach erosion and damaging subsistence crops. The winds downed a few trees and wrecked some poorly built <b>homes.</b> <b>On</b> nearby Faraulep and Fais islands, similar meteorological conditions and damages were reported. The small Ngulu Atoll received gale force winds and heavy rainfall, which destroyed half of the island's water storage tanks. Later in its duration, Sudal passed near Iwo Jima, producing wind gusts of 141km/h (87mph).|$|E

5|$|George Wimpey became Taylor Wimpey {{through a}} {{corporate}} merger and submitted an application in 2010 {{to build a}} further 15 <b>homes</b> <b>on</b> the site. A report by the London Borough of Hillingdon's planning department rejected the proposal in December that year {{on the grounds that}} the site was already overdeveloped. Local residents had raised this concern in November that year, which the leader of the council explained was out of the council's control due to planning laws.|$|E
5|$|NY38 {{continues}} {{north as}} an unnamed highway to the hamlet of Conquest, {{a small community}} built up around the intersection of NY38 and Fuller and Slayton Roads. It continues on into the town of Victory, where the undeveloped fields give way to cultivated fields used as farmland. The route heads through mostly desolate surroundings to the hamlet of Victory, a slightly larger community centered on NY38. The route proceeds through the hamlet, passing by several <b>homes</b> <b>on</b> {{its way to a}} junction with NY370 just north of the community. Past this point, the homes cease again as NY38 presses on through more fields and forests to the town of Sterling.|$|E
5|$|Shanshan's {{effects on}} Japan and its {{outlying}} Pacific islands were widespread. On Iriomote, a peak gust of 69.9 metres per second (251km/h, 157mph) was recorded, the strongest ever on record since records started in 1972. On Ishigaki, Okinawa, a peak gust of 67.0m/s (241km/h, 150mph) was reported, with rainfall rates {{of up to}} 50mm per hour (2inches per hour) reported. Over 25,000 <b>homes</b> <b>on</b> Ishigaki lost power after 182 utility poles were downed by the storm, and at least 12people on the island were injured.

50|$|<b>Home</b> <b>on</b> the Range was {{scheduled}} for a 2003 release, while Brother Bear was originally slated for a spring 2004 release. However, Disney announced that Brother Bear would be released in fall 2003, while <b>Home</b> <b>on</b> the Range was pushed back for a spring 2004 release. Contrary to speculation, news writer Jim Hill stated the release date switch was not because <b>Home</b> <b>on</b> the Range was suffering from story rewrites, but to promote Brother Bear on the Platinum Edition VHS and DVD release of The Lion King.|$|R

5|$|The {{strong winds}} from Paka left around 1,500buildings {{destroyed}} on the island, of which 1,160 were single-family homes. A further 10,000buildings sustained damage to some degree, with 60% of the <b>homes</b> <b>on</b> the island reporting major damage. In all, about 5,000people were left homeless {{due to the}} typhoon. Additionally, an estimated 30–40% of the public buildings received major damage. Buildings on the island made of reinforced concrete fared well, as opposed to light metal-frame structures, which {{more often than not}} were destroyed. Large tourist hotels near Hagåtña, on which Guam is dependent, received generally minor damage, such as broken windows and damaged power generators.|$|E
5|$|Thousands of {{residents}} evacuated coastal areas of South Carolina, {{many of whom}} stayed at inland hotels; 850people sought protection in shelters, including 500 at an elementary school in Horry County and 240 in a shelter in the Grand Strand. In Beaufort County, city and county offices were closed early and businesses were advised to send their workers home prematurely. Officials in Chatham County, Georgia evacuated nursing <b>homes</b> <b>on</b> Tybee Island, and encouraged others to leave due to the potential for high tides to isolate the island by cutting off U.S. Route 80.|$|E
5|$|Across Oman, Phet's {{damage was}} {{estimated}} at over 300million rials (US$780million). Strong winds knocked down billboards, trees, and power lines, causing power outages. Water pipes and desalination plants were also damaged. Storm flooding washed away hundreds of cars, while also damaging roads and bridges. Nationwide, the cyclone wrecked thousands of <b>homes.</b> <b>On</b> the offshore Masirah Island, Phet's storm surge damaged or wrecked some boats, while strong winds damaged tin roofs and satellite dishes. The roof and compound wall of a resort hotel were damaged. Across eastern and northern Oman, heavy rainfall from Phet flooded low-lying areas and produced landslides. The Royal Oman Police helped direct or traffic after many roads were inundated or blocked. The floodwaters entered homes in Al-Ghubra and Al Athaiba, {{as well as the}} Qurum market in Muscat. According to Oman's National Committee for Civil Defence, Phet killed 16people in the country, although the IMD reported the death toll at 24.|$|E

5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of October27 the Colombian Government issued a {{tropical}} storm warning for the islands of San Andrés and Providencia. Hours later, a hurricane watch was issued. By late morning, both advisories were replaced by a hurricane warning. The island did not have much time to prepare for Hurricane Beta, being struck only three days after its formation. Of its 5,000residents all stayed to weather the storm but, about 300 of them evacuated wooden <b>homes</b> <b>on</b> the beach for sturdier brick shelters inland on the island's mountains. The neighbouring island of San Andrés initiated a moratorium on all outdoor activities as the storm's outer bands reached the island on October 29. Officials evacuated about 700 people, 500 tourists and 200 residents on San Andrés to temporary shelters. The Colombian Government provided 8tons (7.2tonnes) of food and emergency supplies, including 1,100 sheets, 300 hammocks, and 350 cooking kits to the island.|$|E
5|$|Five of the state's {{counties}} are wholly {{within the boundaries}} of sovereign Indian reservations. Because of the limitations of climate and land, and isolation from urban areas with more employment opportunities, living standards on many South Dakota reservations are often far below the national average; Ziebach County ranked as the poorest county in the nation in 2009. The unemployment rate in Fort Thompson, on the Crow Creek Reservation, is 70%, and 21% of households lack plumbing or basic kitchen appliances. A 1995 study by the U.S. Census Bureau found 58% of <b>homes</b> <b>on</b> the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation did not have a telephone. The reservations' isolation also inhibits their ability to generate revenue from gaming casinos, an avenue that has proved profitable for many tribes closer to urban centers.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Presentation College {{went into}} administration. It {{was taken over}} by the Society of Licensed Victuallers and renamed The Elvian School. The school closed in 2010. Following its closure, Taylor Wimpey applied to build 193 new <b>homes</b> <b>on</b> the site, {{competing}} with a proposal by a community group (the West Reading Education Network) to reopen the site as a free school known as the WREN. The housing plan was rejected, but Taylor Wimpey then appealed to Reading Borough Council and submitted a revised plan for 120 homes, which left room for the school. The appeal was taken to the High Court, which ruled that the site should be used solely for education; the school opened for Year Seven pupils on 7 September 2015.|$|E
