40|$|The {{accurate}} {{determination of}} the surface charge density at the mercury | solution interface by the method of extrusion of mercury drops is impaired by the faradaic current caused by traces of electroactive species. This paper describes a new design of a hanging mercury drop electrode with accurate control of the <b>extruded</b> <b>electrode</b> area, to within 0. 1 %, together with a new and reliable procedure for correction of the faradaic current. The procedure is based on first obtaining the correction parameters {{in the presence of}} increasing amounts of electroactive species and then using these parameters for correction of the faradaic component so as to obtain the surface charge density of the electrode. Implementation of the method with a microcomputer controlled system provides automatic acquisition of corrected electrode charge density values {{as a function of the}} electrode potential. The results obtained with this new method are in excellent agreement with those obtained by other methods, as illustrated for aqueous sodium fluoride solution. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{complication}} rate of cochlear implant surgery {{is low and}} so-called electrode failures (electrode migration, misplacement, etc.,) account for {{only a minority of}} all complications. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the prevalence of electrode migration as the cause for increased impedance values and non-auditory stimulation in the basal channels. Within the scope of a quality control process, the cochlear implant database of the Kuopio University Hospital (Finland) was reviewed. Patients with gradual elevation of impedance values and/or non-auditory stimulation of the basal electrode channels were re-examined and cone-beam computed tomography was administered. There were 162 cochlear implant recipients and 201 implanted devices registered in the database. A total of 18 patients (18 devices) were identified having significantly increased impedance values or non-auditory stimulation of the basal electrodes. Cone-beam computed tomography revealed extra-cochlear electrodes in 12 of these patients due to the migration of the <b>electrode</b> array. All <b>extruded</b> <b>electrodes</b> were lateral wall electrodes, i. e., straight electrode arrays (Cochlear CI 422 and Med-El devices). The most common feature of electrode migration was the gradual increase of the impedance values in the basal electrodes, even though telemetry could also be unsuspicious. Electrode migration after cochlear implant surgery may be more common than previously reported. At surgery, special attention should be paid to the reliable fixation of the electrode array. This study underlines the importance of postoperative imaging after cochlear implant surgery...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a nominal-composition Cu- 5 vol. % TiC alloy, prepared via powder metallurgy, was evaluated when such material was used as electrodes for electrical-resistance welding. Starting from Cu, Ti and graphite powders, flakes of the alloy were synthesized by reaction milling in a high-energy mill; alloy bars 6 mm diameter were then produced by hot <b>extruding</b> such flakes. <b>Electrodes</b> performance was evaluated {{by means of the}} following indexes: tip shortening, tip widening, and mass loss. Electrolytic copper electrodes were used as reference. The results obtained clearly demonstrate that the Cu-TiC electrodes prepared from powders synthesized by reaction milling have a remarkably better performance than those manufactured from electrolytic copper...|$|R
