40|$|The work {{presents}} the study on flow boiling crisis in <b>helical</b> <b>coils</b> at low pressure with water as working medium. Published correlations of {{critical heat flux}} in <b>helical</b> <b>coils</b> are collated. The characteristics of boiling crisis in <b>helical</b> <b>coils</b> are studied. The experiments are performed with six <b>helical</b> <b>coils</b> made of SS 304 tubes having inner diameters varying from 6 to 10 mm. The coil diameter to the tube diameter ratio ranges from 14 to 58. The critical heat flux data are collected in complete saturated region for the quality range of 0 - 1. The wall temperature distribution is measured in the axial direction using infrared thermal imaging technique. The results concluded that, the wall temperature in inner half surface is higher than outer half surface of <b>helical</b> <b>coils.</b> Increase in mass flux increases the critical heat flux. Critical heat flux decreases with increase in quality. For the same quality, the critical heat flux decreases with increase in tube diameter and coil diameter. In a high quality region, the critical heat flux in <b>helical</b> <b>coils</b> is higher than vertical straight tubes.

40|$|Configuration {{optimization}} {{is carried}} out for the heliotron-type fusion energy reactor FFHR. One of the important issues is to find sufficient clearances between the ergodic region outside the nested magnetic surfaces and blankets at the inboard side of the torus so that direct loss of alpha particles is minimized and the heat flux on the first walls is reduced. Though the primary option {{is to have a}} fairly large major radius Rc of the <b>helical</b> <b>coils</b> to be ~ 17 m in the present design, it has been found that equivalent clearances are obtained with Rc = 15 m by employing a lower helical pitch parameter and by splitting the <b>helical</b> <b>coils</b> in the poloidal cross-section at the outboard side of the torus. On the other hand, splitting the <b>helical</b> <b>coils</b> provides another modified configuration with Rc ~ 17 m that ensures magnetic well formation in the fairly large nested magnetic surfaces with outward shifted configurations.

The excellent properties of foam fluid are useful {{but it is difficult}} to simulate it. At present, Foam fluid combined with CT is used in well intervention as a practical and cost-effective mean of servicing wells. This paper discusses the flow law of foam fluid in coiled tubing through user defined function and numerical simulation method combining the characteristics of foam fluid. First, the rheology of foam is described by Power-law model, Then, a function about density of foam fluid is obtained by considering the pressure and temperature. After that, the geometric model of <b>helical</b> <b>coiled</b> tubing is established, According to hydrodynamic theory, based on continuity equation and N-S equation, the numerical simulation for foam fluid flow in helical CT is carried out.

Now, it is considered that the subcooled He I are used to improve the operating condition of the superconducting magnets of the LHD <b>helical</b> <b>coils.</b> To use subcooled He I as a coolant for the superconducting magnets of the LHD <b>helical</b> <b>coils,</b> we need to investigate the cooling characteristics and the stability of a superconducting coil in the subcooled He I. So, an R & D coil, wound with superconductors for the LHD <b>helical</b> <b>coils,</b> was cooled with the subcooled and saturated helium, and then stability tests of the coil were carried out.
