40|$|This Master of Engineering thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a portable, multiple-sensor instrument to provide rapid, quantitative snow stability information over the area of an avalanche start zone. Using a modified geomechanics shear vane an extensive fieldwork programme was carried out with the primary objective of correlating the shear vane against traditional measures of snow shear strength. Numerous shear vane configurations were investigated {{during the course of this}} research and their relative effectiveness in predicting snow slope stability was determined. A prototype shear penetrometer was then developed based on the findings of this study and incorporated sensors to measure snowpack penetration force, temperature and shear strength. Use of a miniature signal transmitter contained within the <b>instrument</b> <b>probe</b> enabled data to be transmitted to a receiver unit and laptop computer at the snow surface. A test rig was also developed, applying the mechanical force required to drive the <b>instrument</b> <b>probe</b> down into the snowpack. The design of this test rig provides the <b>instrument</b> <b>probe</b> with a rotational motion in an axis perpendicular to snowpack layering and a translational motion along this axis with rotational and translational speeds able to be varied independently. The shear penetrometer was developed to a level where all three system components (the <b>instrument</b> <b>probe,</b> laptop/receiver unit and the test rig) were operational to a degree that field testing could be carried out. Work is to continue within the University of Canterbury on the development of the operator interface, field testing of the prototype instrument and development of new sensor modules...|$|R

40|$|A {{preliminary}} study {{is made of}} some {{problems associated with the}} sending of an <b>instrumented</b> <b>probe</b> close to the Sun for the purpose of gathering and telemetering back to Earth information concerning solar phenomena and circumsolar space.

40|$|Previously we have {{described}} the Computer Aided Tap Tester (CATT), a simple <b>instrumented</b> <b>probe</b> and software that facilitates the generation of tap test C‐scans in field environments. Early in the CATT development {{it was noted that}} inspectors prefer hand tapping at random locations over the part, eventually covering the part to the satisfaction of the inspector. To speed inspections, a regimented method of tapping was incorporated into the CATT via a grid laid over the part. Although the CATT system is quite simple to use, the method of tapping at each grid location in a pre‐determined raster pattern continues to encounter resistance from the inspectors. The preferred free scanning of the inspection area dovetails nicely with the GenScan system previously reported on, where the operator scans over the inspection area freely, starting with larger pixels, and refines the geometry of flaw indications with finer pixels.

40|$|Common deterrents to cycling in North America are {{the real}} and/or {{perceived}} concerns on the safety, comfort, and practicality of choosing cycling over other modes of transportation, concerns that may be addressed by improved cycling facilities. The challenge lies in effectively quantifying the desirability of cycling facilities to assess return on investment for bicycle infrastructure decisions. In this paper an ordinal logit regression model is proposed as a potential Bicycle Comfort and Safety Prediction Model (BCSPM) to quantitatively predict a cyclist’s perceived safety and comfort. These BCSPMs were developed by conducting experiments utilizing an <b>Instrumented</b> <b>Probe</b> Bicycle (IPB). The IPB {{used in this study}} was developed using research from around the world. Many sensors were used, including: a 3 DM-GX 3 inertial sensor collecting time-stamped, position, velocity, and roll/yaw/pitch angles; and, a Microsoft Kinect sensor (still being operationalized) to record time-stamped eye/head positions, facial expressions, pulse, and ambient noise levels. Data for the BCSPM was collected from IPB sensors (numeric), field assessments (subjective numeric and categorical), and IPB rider questionnaires (categorical, Likert scales of comfort/safety). This paper outlines the potential applications of the BCSPM, the early modeling results of the study, the challenges faced, potential improvements that can be made to the IPB, and the next steps in this research.

40|$|Abstract. The second {{mission of}} the small {{expendable}} deployment system (SEDS-II) followed the successful mission of SEDS-I, which deployed freely a small <b>instrumented</b> <b>probe</b> on a 20 -km tether. Unlike SEDS-I, the deployment of SEDS-II was controlled to provide a small libration amplitude and tether velocity {{at the end of}} deployment. The preflight goal for SEDS-II was a maximum libration of less than 10 deg and a final velocity of less than 1 m/s. The control problem was made difficult by the limited capabilities of the SEDS sensors and onboard computer and the large uncertainties inherent in the response of the actuator (brake) and the plant (deployer). The nonlinear, nonautonomous control problem is divided in two parts by using a numerically formulated feedback linearization, i. e., by devising 1) a nonlinear control (reference) trajectory and 2) a linear control about the reference trajectory. An ad hoc feedback law that forces the perturbed system to follow the reference trajectory is derived by using a linearized variational model. The controller is then tested, through computer simulations, for large deviations of the model parameters on the nonlinear model. The relevant flight data are also presented and compared to the reference values to demonstrate the validity and robustness of the control law, which provided a maximum libration amplitude of less than 4 deg and a final tether velocity of less than 0. 02 m/s...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: In total knee arthroplasty, {{surgical}} navigation systems provide tibio-femoral joint (TFJ) tracking for relevant bone preparation, {{disregarding the}} patello-femoral joint (PFJ). Therefore, the important intra-operative {{assessment of the}} effect of component positioning, including the patella, on the kinematics of these two joints is not available. The objective {{of this study is to}} explore in vivo whether accurate tracking of the patella can result in a more physiological TFJ and PFJ kinematics during surgery. METHODS: Ten patients underwent navigated knee replacement with patellar resurfacing. A secondary system was used to track patellar motion and PFJ kinematics using a special tracker. Patellar resection plane position and orientation were recorded using an <b>instrumented</b> <b>probe.</b> During all surgical steps, PFJ kinematics was measured in addition to TFJ kinematics. RESULTS: Abnormal PFJ motion patterns were observed pre-operatively at the impaired knee. Patellar resection plane orientation on sagittal and transverse planes of 3. 9 ° ± 9. 0 ° and 0. 4 ° ± 4. 1 ° was found. A good restoration of both TFJ and PFJ kinematics was observed in all replaced knees after resurfacing, in particular the rotations in the three anatomical planes and medio-lateral patellar translation. CONCLUSIONS: Patella tracking results in nearly physiological TFJ and PFJ kinematics in navigated knee arthroplasty with resurfacing. The intra-operative availability also of PFJ kinematics can support the positioning not only of the patellar component in case of resurfacing, but also of femoral and tibial components. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Thermal {{diffusivity}} (TD) is {{a measure}} of the temperature response of a material to external thermal forcing. In this study, TD values for marine sediments were determined in situ at two locations on the Cascadia Margin using an instrumented sediment probe deployed by a remotely operated vehicle. TD measurements in this area of the NE Pacific Ocean are important for characterizing the upslope edge of the methane hydrate stability zone, which is the climate-sensitive boundary of a global-scale carbon reservoir. The probe was deployed on the Cascadia Margin at water depths of 552 and 1049 m for a total of 6 days at each site. The <b>instrumented</b> <b>probe</b> consisted of four thermistors aligned vertically, one sensor exposed to the bottom water and one each at 5, 10, and 15 cm within the sediment. Results from each deployment were analyzed using a thermal conduction model applying a range of TD values to obtain the best fit with the experimental data. TD values corresponding to the lowest standard deviations from the numerical model runs were selected as the best approximations. Overall TDs of Cascadia Margin sediments of 4. 33 and 1. 15 × 10 – 7 m 2 s– 1 were calculated for the two deployments. These values, the first of their kind to be determined from in situ measurements on a methane hydrate-rich continental margin, are expected to be useful in the development of models of bottom-water temperature increases and their implications on a global scale...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwo {{different}} methodologies {{for assessing}} the friction between plantar skin and sock textiles are compared in this study. The first approach uses a custom-built friction plate rig. The rig consists of sock material mounted on a test plate attached to two load cells that measure normal and shear loads at the skin-sock textile interface. With this methodology, participants are required to slide their foot over the test plate whilst maintaining a targeted normal load and a relatively consistent sliding speed. The second approach uses a pneumatically-driven foot probe loading device. The device includes an <b>instrumented</b> <b>probe</b> with sock material on its contact surface. Participants are instructed to stand on a platform whilst the probe is applied to, and then driven across, the plantar aspect of foot. The cyclic motion of the probe is displacement-controlled and normal and shear loads are measured using load cells. Both approaches allow friction coefficients to be calculated from load data collected during the sliding phase of movement. Data from both approaches was examined, collected from friction tests using the same six participants and sliding contact between the first metatarsal head (1 MTH) region and textiles from two commercially available running socks. Both approaches were capable of measuring the friction between 1 MTH skin and sock materials and good agreement was found between them.
