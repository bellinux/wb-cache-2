Poetry is one possible stage in a life process. Within the limits of man's fate, the poet's language is able to express his existence although it is not able to create it."(p5) According to Mathieu: [...] "The trouble with A Season in <b>Hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it points only one way: where it’s going is where it’s coming from.

5000|$|The Catechism of the Catholic Church (1992) {{describes}} hell as [...] "eternal death" [...] (para 1861) {{and elsewhere}} states that [...] "the chief punishment of <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of eternal separation from God" [...] (para 1035). The {{question is what}} [...] "eternal" [...] means in this context. Thomas Aquinas, following Boethius, states that [...] "eternity is the full, perfect and simultaneous possession of unending life" [...] (Summa Theologica I, question 10), so apparently eternal separation from God is a [...] "negative eternity", a complete and permanent separation from God. In the Collect (opening prayer) for the eighth Sunday after Pentecost in the Tridentine missal, we find the words [...] "qui sine te esse non possumus", meaning [...] "we who without Thee cannot be (or exist)". Putting these two citations together in a literal sense would seem to suggest annihilationism, which, however, is contrary to Catholic teaching.|$|E

Frey asked the dealer to slow down and the response was, [...] "What do you mean? It's life in the fast lane!" [...] In that same interview, Frey indicated that the song's central riff was played by Walsh while the band was warming up in rehearsals and Walsh was told to [...] "keep that; it's a song." [...] Don Henley recalled that the [...] "song actually sprang from the opening guitar riff.

[...] —Alex Kapranos, the lead singer of indie rock band Franz Ferdinand, says the song inspired the band to work with [...] "Wake Me Up" [...] producer Brian Higgins. Following a brief hiatus, Polydor Records enlisted Brian Higgins and Xenomania to produce Girls Aloud's second album in its entirety, following {{the success of their}} debut album. Higgins explained that Polydor were not going to continue with the group's contract unless he produced songs for the album. He continued, saying that his initial reaction was that he thought he would only be required to produce a couple of songs, however Polydor insisted that he produce the album in its entirety and that they thought only he understood what they wanted. The album was recorded from April to September 2004, with the lead single being released in June 2004.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{argument}} against the justice of <b>Hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> humans are not culpable for their sins, since sinning is unavoidable to them. For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; (Epistle to the Romans, 3:23) However, the statement [...] "all have sinned" [...] does not necessarily indicate that sin is unavoidable (Hebrews 4:15) Also, if God is omniscient/prescient, he {{is aware of the}} outcome before anyone enters into Heaven or Hell. From the reasoning that God created them in the first place, some {{go so far as to}} ascribe to Him the culpability for a person's eternal fate. The question is all the more burning if one states exactly this (positive reprobation, Calvinism). However, the (theoretically distinct) doctrine of negative reprobation without consideration of future demerits (Domingo Báñez) — God elects some, the others fall into sin on their own, but of necessity, and are then judged for their sins—will be felt not so much distinct [...] "in practice". If the angels and the blessed without inconvenience to their free will partake of an irresistible grace (which is thus shown possible), even who holds an at least conditional election of every human being (Molinism and, despite notable academic success of Thomist grace theology within the Catholic pale, in practice the stand of Catholics) needs to say that God could have rescued some and did not. Here, again, the discussion shades into that on the problem of evil.|$|E
