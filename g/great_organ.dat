25|$|The first organ in the Cathedral {{was built}} nearly 200 years after {{construction}} was completed. The first <b>great</b> <b>organ</b> {{was built in}} 1726–30. The town council voted to have the organ built on 5 June 1726. They hired Gottlieb Leuw from Bremgarten in September 1726. By January 1730 his work was nearly finished and the town began searching for an organist. While the main organ was finished in 1730, the ornamentation and finish work continued until 1736. This first organ had 38 organ stops, with a breast and back {{work as well as}} an echo work with pedals.|$|E
500|$|Zwingli criticised the {{practice}} of priestly chanting and monastic choirs. The criticism dates from 1523 when he attacked certain worship practices. His arguments are detailed in the Conclusions of 1525, in which, Conclusions 44, 45 and 46 are concerned with musical practices {{under the rubric of}} [...] "prayer". He associated music with images and vestments, all of which he felt diverted people's attention from true spiritual worship. It is not known what he thought of the musical practices in early Lutheran churches. Zwingli, however, eliminated instrumental music from worship in the church, stating that God had not commanded it in worship. The organist of the People's Church in Zurich is recorded as weeping upon seeing the <b>great</b> <b>organ</b> broken up. Although Zwingli did not express an opinion on congregational singing, he made no effort to encourage it. Nevertheless, scholars have found that Zwingli was supportive of a role for music in the church. Gottfried W. Locher writes, [...] "The old assertion 'Zwingli was against church singing' holds good no longer... Zwingli's polemic is concerned exclusively with the medieval Latin choral and priestly chanting and not with the hymns of evangelical congregations or choirs". Locher {{goes on to say that}} [...] "Zwingli freely allowed vernacular psalm or choral singing. In addition, he even seems to have striven for lively, antiphonal, unison recitative". Locher then summarizes his comments on Zwingli's view of church music as follows: [...] "The chief thought in his conception of worship was always 'conscious attendance and understanding'—'devotion', yet with the lively participation of all concerned".|$|E

2500|$|Musical offerings at Saint Thomas Church are {{enhanced}} {{through three}} organs. The Arents Memorial Chancel Organ was initially built as the [...] "Opus 205" [...] of the Ernest M. Skinner Company of Boston, Massachusetts in 1913. This organ, which was revised in 1945, boasted 4 manuals and 77 ranks. In 1956, the organ was rebuilt, as [...] "Opus 205-A", by the Aeolian-Skinner Company by G. Donald Harrison (d. 1956), who died before {{the work was}} completed. This rebuilding expanded the organ to comprise 172 ranks. With damage to the reredos and the organ due to construction of the Museum of Modern Art, the church's immediate neighbor on West 53rd Street, Gilbert F. Adams of Brooklyn was contracted in 1969 to repair and rebuilt the organ. This revision decreased the number of ranks to 156. Further revisions were completed in the early 1980s by Mann & Trupiano. With {{the exception of the}} Trompette-en-Chamade, located under the Rose Window above the narthex, the entire instrument of the <b>Great</b> <b>Organ</b> is located in the church's chancel. In its present form, the <b>Great</b> <b>Organ</b> features an Electro-pneumatic and electric-slider stop and chest action, a Solid-State combination action, 4 manuals, 158 ranks and 9,050 pipes.|$|E

The teacher's {{position}} and house were given to a successor, and Bruckner {{was sent to the}} Augustinian monastery in Sankt Florian to become a choirboy. In addition to choir practice, his education included violin and organ lessons. Bruckner was in awe of the monastery's <b>great</b> <b>organ,</b> which was built during the late baroque era and rebuilt in 1837, and he sometimes played it during church services. Later, the organ was to be called the [...] "Bruckner Organ". Despite his musical abilities, Bruckner's mother sent her son to a teaching seminar in Linz in 1841.|$|E
2500|$|Entrance to {{the church}} was through three large doors that opened into a high, spacious {{vestibule}} with circular stairways {{on the right and}} left that led to the upstairs gallery or balcony. [...] Directly across from the center entrance was the middle door into the high, square, well-lit sanctuary that for many years was an unpainted white. The balcony that ran around three sides of the sanctuary was supported by wooden posts with the broad center isle leading {{to the front of the}} sanctuary where the old wooden pulpit was hung. [...] The pulpit, supported by two Corinthian pillars of wood, was surmounted by a crimson cushion and was quite an imposing structure. [...] A high crimson curtain hung behind the pulpit arranged in a row of straight folds or [...] "flutes", like the pipes of a <b>great</b> <b>organ</b> topped with a straight lambrequin of the same material. [...] The pulpit had doors on either side, similar to those in the pews below, from which the minister entered. [...] Opposite the pulpit in the gallery was the choir loft, this opened from a large room that was directly over the vestibule where the choir practiced, and instruments were tuned.|$|E
2500|$|Dozens {{of experts}} such as Matthew Digby Wyatt and Owen Jones were hired {{to create a}} series of courts that {{provided}} a narrative {{of the history of}} fine art. Amongst these were Augustus Pugin's Mediaeval Court from the Great Exhibition, as well as courts illustrating Egyptian, Alhambra, Roman, Renaissance, Pompeian, and Grecian art and many others. [...] During the year of re-opening 18 handbooks were published in the Crystal Palace Library by Bradbury & Evans as guides to the new installations. Many of these were written by the specialists involved in creating and curating the new displays. So the 1854 guide to the Egyptian Court, destroyed in the 1866 fire, was entitled: 'The Egyptian Court in the Crystal Palace. Described by Owen Jones, architect, and Joseph Bonomi, sculptor'. That which included a description of the dinosaurs was entitled: 'Geology and Inhabitants of the Ancient World. Described by Richard Owen, FRS. The animals constructed by B.W.Hawkins, FGS'. In the central transept was the 4,000-piece Grand Orchestra built around the 4,500-pipe <b>Great</b> <b>Organ.</b> [...] There was a concert room with over 4,000 seats that hosted successful Handel Festivals for many years. The performance spaces hosted concerts, exhibits, and public entertainment. The Centre Transept of the Crystal Palace also once housed a circus and was the scene of daring feats by world-famous acts such as the tightrope walker Charles Blondin. Over the years many famous leaders visited the Crystal Palace, and were accorded special festivals, with extended published programs. That for Garibaldi was entitled [...] "General Garibaldi's Italian Reception and Concert Saturday April 16, 1864"; and that for the Shah: [...] "Crystal Palace. Grand Fête in [...] honour of His Majesty The Shah of Persia KG. Saturday July 6th" [...] (1889). [...] From the beginning general programs were printed, at first for the summer season, and then on a daily basis. So for instance that for the summer of 1864 [...] "Programme of arrangements for the eleventh season, commencing on the 1st May, 1864" [...] included the Shakespeare Tercentenary Festival and [...] a course by designer Christopher Dresser. The daily [...] "Programme for Monday October 6th (1873) included a harvest exhibition of fruit, and the Australasian Collection, formed by H E Pain, of materials from Tasmania, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Australia, NZ; and grand military fete was also on offer. Many of these publications were printed by Dickens and Evans, that is Charles Dickens jnr., Dickens' son working with his father-in-law Frederick Evans. [...] Another feature of the early programming were Christmas pantomimes, with published librettos, for instance Harry Lemon's 'Dick Whittington and His Wonderful Cat. Crystal Palace Christmas 1869–70' (London 1869).|$|E
