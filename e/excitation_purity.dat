All identified natural frequencies and mode shapes correlate well with corresponding ground vibration test results. The modal identification approach discussed in this report has become increasingly attractive in recent years due to the steadily declining cost and increased performance of scientific computers. As illustrated in this application modern time-domain methods can be successfully applied to data acquired using DLR's existing test equipment. Some suggestions are made for future applications of time domain modal identification in this manner...|$|R
40|$|True on-demand high-repetition-rate single-photon {{sources are}} highly sought after for quantum {{information}} processing applications. However, any coherently driven two-level quantum system suffers from finite re-excitation processes under pulsed <b>excitation,</b> limiting the <b>purity</b> of on-demand single-photon emission. Here, {{we present a}} solid-state source of on-demand single-photons yielding a raw multi-photon emission probability of g^(2) (0) =(7. 5 ± 1. 6) · 10 ^- 5 without any background subtraction nor data processing. To this date, this is the lowest value of g^(2) (0) reported for any single-photon source even compared to the previously best background subtracted values. We achieve this result on GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots embedded in a low-Q planar cavity by employing (i) a two-photon excitation process and (ii) a filtering and detection setup featuring two superconducting single-photon detectors with ultralow dark-count rates of (0. 01 ^+ 0. 02 _- 0. 01) Hz and (0. 02 ^+ 0. 04 _- 0. 02) Hz, respectively. Re-excitation processes are dramatically suppressed by (i), while (ii) removes false coincidences resulting in a negligibly low noise floor...|$|R
50|$|Chromaticity is an {{objective}} specification {{of the quality}} of a color regardless of its luminance. Chromaticity consists of two independent parameters, often specified as hue (h) and colorfulness (s), where the latter is alternatively called saturation, chroma, intensity, or <b>excitation</b> <b>purity.</b> This number of parameters follows from trichromacy of vision of most humans, which is assumed by most models in color science.|$|E

However, <b>excitation</b> <b>purity</b> did not have any significant effects on search response time or on error rates. In experiment II, search task performance was compared between ten character colours with an identical level of luminance whose <b>excitation</b> <b>purity</b> and hue differed, such as red, yellow, green, cyan and other colours.

Methods: A total of 516 healthy adults were taken as the research subjects. The brightness, dominant wavelength and <b>excitation</b> <b>purity</b> values of the supranasal point and the apex nasi during the complexion inspection of subjects were calculated. This was based on the visible reflection spectrum, and the linear correlation/regression analysis between the brightness Y value and the dominant wavelength or <b>excitation</b> <b>purity</b> value. Results: There was no correlation between the brightness Y value and the dominant wavelength of the normal supranasal point and the apex nasi; however, there was negative correlation between the brightness Y value and the <b>excitation</b> <b>purity</b> of the normal supranasal point and apex nasi. Conclusion: During the complexion inspection, the brightness Y value would not influence the dominant wavelength value, indicating that whiteness and/or blackness would not influence the normal individual complexion. However, the brightness Y value would influence the <b>excitation</b> <b>purity</b> of the supranasal point and the apex nasi, and the degree of saturation should be referred to as the brightness.

40|$|Subjective {{preference}} of text colours {{used in a}} cathode-ray tube (CRT) visual display was examined experimentally by comparing 26 text colours presented against a nearly black background. Sixteen of these colours were different in hue and saturation (<b>excitation</b> <b>purity),</b> and the remaining were presented in white with different levels of character luminance. The background luminance was fixed at 1 cd/㎡. By means of the pair comparison method, {{subjects were asked to}} rate which colour of the two text colours presented simultaneously on the screen was preferable. The replies from 32 subjects about 325 combinations indicated that among the ten white presentations, the best preferred was one with about 40 cd/㎡ incharacter luminance. It was further found that desaturated colours of yellow, yellowish green, cyan and magenta with less than O. 4 of <b>excitation</b> <b>purity</b> were preferred to white with the same character luminance. Saturated colours of red, blue, yellow and green with more than 0. 5 of <b>excitation</b> <b>purity</b> were disliked.

40|$|Groups of newborn human infants (N 180) were habituated {{to large}} 167 {{achromatic}} (‘‘white’’) lights of varying luminance (0. 35 to 1. 16 log cd/m 2) and then tested for recovery of habituation to 167 green (dominant l 545 nm), yellow (dominant l 585 nm) or red (dominant l 650 nm) lights which varied {{in the level}} of <b>excitation</b> <b>purity</b> (range 32 to 83 %). Results showed that newborns discriminated the chromatic stimuli from white only when <b>excitation</b> <b>purity</b> values exceeded at least 41 % for 545 -nm green, 47 % for 650 -nm red, and 65 % for 585 -nm yellow, limits much higher than those for adults (1 %). Taken together with the results from previous experi-ments, these saturation discrimination data (with the exception of the yellow data), provide some support for an expanded MacAdam ellipse model of early color dis-crimination (Brown, 1993; Teller & Lindsey, 1993).

40|$|A {{most common}} problem {{encountered}} in radiosterilization of solid drugs is discoloration or yellowing. By pharmacopoeia method, discoloration {{can be assessed}} by measuring absorbance of solutions of irradiated solid samples at 450  nm. We propose to evaluate discoloration of solid samples directly by recording their diffuse reflectance spectra. Further, the reflectance spectrum is used to compute various color parameters: CIE XYZ tristimulus value, CIE Lab, Δ E_ab^ * (color difference), yellowness index (YI), dominant wavelength, and <b>excitation</b> <b>purity</b> by CIE method. The investigation of difference reflectance spectra and color parameters revealed that for fluoroquinolones, e-beam was more damaging than gamma radiation, whereas for cephalosporins, trend was reversed. The quantum of discoloration with gamma radiation and e-beam {{is found to be}} nearly equal when assessed by pharmacopeia method, and it is therefore inadequate to assess small color differences. The color parameters Δ E_ab^ * and ΔYI are found to be reliable indicators of discoloration. The tolerance limits proposed in terms of /Delta E_ab^ * and ΔYI are ± 2 and ± 10  U, respectively. The dominant wavelength for all compounds has shifted to higher values indicating change in hue but defining color tolerance limit with this parameter requires adjunct <b>excitation</b> <b>purity</b> value...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In this study, {{the optical}} data of tongue color of {{different}} syndromes in primary hepatic carcinoma (PHC) were detected by optical spectrum colorimetry, and the chromaticity of tongue color was compared and analyzed. The tongue color characteristics of different syndromes in PHC {{and the relationship}} between different syndromes and tongue color were also investigated. METHODS: Tongue color data from 133 eligible PHC patients were collected by optical spectrum colorimetry and the patients were divided into 4 syndrome groups according to their clinical features. The syndrome groups were liver depression and spleen deficiency (LDSD), accumulation of damp-heat (ADH), deficiency of liver and kidney yin (DLKY), and qi stagnation and blood stasis (QSBS). The variation characteristics of chromaticity coordinates, dominant wavelength, <b>excitation</b> <b>purity</b> and the distribution in the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) LAB uniform color space were measured. At the same time, the differences of overall chromatism, clarity, chroma, saturation and hue were also calculated and analyzed. RESULTS: PHC patients in different syndrome groups exhibited differences in chromaticity coordinates. The dominant wavelength of QSBS was distinctly {{different from that of the}} other 3 syndromes. <b>Excitation</b> <b>purity</b> in the syndromes of LDSD, ADH and DLKY showed gradual increases (P＜ 0. 01). Different syndromes in the CIE LAB color three-dimensional space showed differences in tongue color distribution areas. The CIE hue-angle value of QSBS was negative, and different from that of the other 3 syndromes (P＜ 0. 01). CIE chroma in the syndromes of LDSD, ADH and DLKY showed gradual increases (P＜ 0. 01), the same as <b>excitation</b> <b>purity.</b> In the comparison of chromatism, tongue color variations in different syndromes were quantified by human observation. CONCLUSION: This study shows that tongue color diagnosis according to the syndrome classifications of traditional Chinese medicine can be quantified with optical spectrum colorimetry technology. Different syndromes in PHC exhibit distinct chromatisms of tongue color through the calculation and analysis of chromaticity parameters of CIE, combined with colorimetric system and CIE LAB color space, and these are consistent with the characteristics of clinical tongue color. Applying optical spectrum colorimetry technology to tongue color differentiation has the potential to serve as a reference point in standardizing traditional Chinese medicine syndrome classification in PHC...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In a 16 -day {{experiment}} involving 270 32 -week-old laying hens, dehydrated {{turf grass}} (DTG) and corn gluten meal (CGM) were compared as xanthophyll sources for egg yolk pigmentation. Experimental diets were formulated to contain, 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg total xan-thophyll/kg diet, provided as either DTG or CGM. Neither egg production nor feed consumption {{was affected by}} diet. Egg yolk color dominant wavelength increased slightly with increasing dietary xanthophyll and did not differ with source.

40|$|AbstractWe {{have studied}} psychophysically the {{characteristics}} of the postreceptoral stage of visual processing, using heterochromatic brightness matching (HBM) between 540 and 600 nm, and hue discrimination between 565 and 585 nm, under differing luminance flicker (0 – 30 Hz) and <b>excitation</b> <b>purity</b> (1. 0 – 0. 1) conditions. The HBM curves exhibit deeper minima around 575 nm with decreasing purity. The minimum is generally most pronounced with a 3 Hz flicker and least pronounced with a 30 Hz flicker. Hue discrimination ability is relatively insensitive to flicker and deteriorates at the lower purities.

Twenty-two participants viewed 3 images under each of the 15 CRT conditions. Participants edited color balance, brightness, and contrast of each soft-copy image.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} were conducted using 21 -day-old, commercial-strain broilers {{to determine the}} effect of various commercial pigmentation products on pigmentation and bird performance. Birds received finisher/withdrawal diets that included 8 % corn gluten meal or either a 2. 5 or 5. 0 % substitution of gluten meal with Liquid OroGlo 5, ® Dry OroglolO, ® or Cromophyl-oro. ® When birds were slaughtered at either 48 or 51 days of age there were no differences in the birds ' breast skin hue (dominant wavelength) or brightness (luminosity). Data indicated similar levels of pigmentation among birds in all treatments. Color intensity (<b>excitation</b> <b>purity)</b> values of shank and breast skin samples suggested that the liquid form of OroGlo ® was more effective than the dry form in pigmenting broiler skin when both forms were fed at equal calculated levels. Data indicated that actual xanthophyll intake was higher when the liquid source was fed. Body weight gain and feed efficiency among the treatments, in general, indicated that commercial pigment sources can be substituted for corn gluten meal without appreciably altering broiler performance.

40|$|The 'design' of {{any animal}} signal is {{affected}} by at least three selection pressures: (i) the type of information being conveyed (the message); (ii) the transmission properties of the medium; and (iii) the sensory and psychological properties of the receiver. We describe a field study of the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) and examine the 'circling' display of the male {{in the light of}} these three pressures. Analysis of videotape records of the display shows that it carries accurate information about when a spawning dash will occur. The speed with which the pectoral fins are moved increases steadily over the 10 s before spawning so that the exact time of spawning can be predicted. Dark spots (not present when the male is chasing other males) appear on the ends of the pectoral fins and may 'amplify' perception of fin movements. The colour change shown by the male when chasing other males and when courting females was measured in situ by using Munsell colour charts, and was subsequently converted to dominant wavelength and <b>excitation</b> <b>purity</b> equivalents. The circling display appears to be designed to convey information about intention to spawn to a female that is relatively close whilst not conveying this information to other males that are further away...|$|E
40|$|The goal in maxillofacial {{prosthodontics}} is {{to restore}} the patient’s appearance and protect the resection site, allowing improvement in self-esteem to help the patient lead as normal a life as possible. It is important that a prosthesis be fabricated with optimal esthetics and main-tenance of its appearance over its service lifetime. Degra-dation in appearance due to changes in color and physi-cal properties are reasons for refabrication of a facial prosthesis. Koran et al 1 evaluated the accelerated-aging testing with MDX 4 - 4210 that had been colored with dry mineral earth pigments.

40|$|Chromatic {{luminance}} (i. e., luminance of a monochromatic color) is {{the source}} of all luminance, since achromatic luminance arises only from mixing colors and their chromatic luminances. The ratio of chromatic luminance to total luminance (i. e., chromatic plus achromatic luminance) is known as colorimetric purity, and its measurement has long been problematic for nonspectral hues. Colorimetric purity (pc) is a luminance metric in contrast to <b>excitation</b> <b>purity,</b> which is a chromaticity-diagram metric approximating saturation. The CIE definition of pc contains a fallacy. CIE defines maximum (1. 0) pc for spectral stimuli as monochromatic (i. e., optimal) stimuli, and as the line between spectrum ends for nonspectrals. However, this line has < 0. 003 lm/W according to CIE colorimetric data and is therefore effectively invisible. It only represents the limit of theoretically attainable colors, and is of no practical use in color reproduction or color appearance. Required is a locus giving optimal rather than invisible nonspectral stimuli. The problem is partly semantic. CIE wisely adopted the term colorimetric purity, rather than the original spectral luminance purity, to permit an equivalent metric for spectrals and nonspectrals, but the parameter of equivalence was never clear. Since 1 pc denotes optimal aperture-color stimuli for spectrals, arguably 1 pc should denote optimal stimuli consistently for all stimuli. The problem reduces to calculating optimal aperture-color stimuli ("optimal" in energy efficiency in color-matching) for nonspectrals, shown to comprise 442 + 613 nm in all CIE illuminants. This remedy merely requires redefinition of 1 pc for nonspectrals as the line 442 - 613 nm, and gives meaningful pc values over the hue cycle allowing new research of chromatic luminance relations with color appearance. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Affective & Human Factors EngineeringThe {{purposes}} of this research are to identify relation between color perception and connotation of unrelated colors, and to develop mathematical models for color connotation. This research is significant {{in the sense that}} it provides fundamental data for color appearance and color connotation of unrelated colors on which there is a lack of research until now. To achieve these purposes, two psychophysical experiments were carried out. Experiment 1 : Color perception for unrelated colors, to investigate color perception for unrelated color using the 50 color stimuli beamed through a square hole. Twenty-two observers have answered their perceived magnitudes of three color attributes based on the magnitude estimation. Experiment 2 : Color connotation for unrelated colors, to examine color connotation for unrelated colors using the 50 color stimuli. Thirty-two observers have answered their connotation about each color stimulus using the 10 color connotation scales which consist of one aesthetic scale (i. e. “like – Dislike”) and nine non-aesthetic scales (i. e. “Warm – Cool,” “Heavy – Light,” “Modern – Classical,” “Clean – Dirty,” “Active – Passive,” “Hard – Soft,” Tense – Relaxed,” “Fresh – Stale,” and “Masculine – feminine”). Semantic differential method was used for measurement of color connotation scales. The color connotation models having brightness, colorfulness and hue obtained by CAM 97 u and the revised CIECAM 02 as input variables were developed to quantify inter-relation between the color attributes and color connotation space, and further effects of the color attributes on color connotation were visually analyzed based on conventional bubble charts. The major findings from the experiments are summarized as follows: In experiment 1 : Color perception for unrelated colors, the experimental results shows that the three perceptual attributes of unrelated colors such as brightness, colorfulness and hue can be estimated by the colorimetric properties of color stimuli (i. e. luminance, <b>excitation</b> <b>purity</b> and CIE 1976 hue-angle). It is found that the estimate values of the color attributes are positively proportional to perceived magnitudes of the color attributes. The performance comparison is made of proposed estimation model with CAM 97 u and revised CIECAM 02. The revised CIECAM 02 gives the best satisfactory estimations of brightness, colorfulness and hue under photopic vision. In experiment 2 : Color connotation for unrelated colors, the experimental results shows that color connotation of unrelated colors has a three-dimensional space, and the three axes are “Color solidity,” “Color heat,” and “Color purity. ” “Color solidity” is associated with “Hard-Soft,” “Heavy-Light,” “Tense-Relaxed,” and “Active-Passive. ” “Color heat” is correlated with “Warm-Cool” and “Feminine-Masculine”, and “Color purity” has relevance to “Clean-Dirty” and “Fresh-Stale. ” In short, color connotation for unrelated colors is a function of the three color appearance attributes. All the color connotation scales are correlated with the color attributes. Four color connotation scales, “Warm-Cool,” “Heavy-Light,” “Active-Passive” and “Hard-Soft”, were modeled. The scale “Warm-Cool” is associated with hue angle and colorfulness, while significant relation between “warm-Cool” and brightness is not found. The other scales are connected with the color difference between the test color and neutral color of which brightness are varied with the color connotation scales. This implies that “Heavy-Light,” “Active-Passive” and “Hard-Soft” have relevance to colorfulness. Furthermore, the three-dimensional color connotation space for unrelated colors is associated with the color attributes. The significant correlations between the axes of the color connotation space and color attributes are as follows: “Color solidity” with colorfulness, “Color heat” with both hue angle and colorfulness, “Color purity” with brightness. There is room for further improvement and development in this research. (1) The data sets obtained by this research need to examine repeatability, (2) relationships of color connotations between unrelated colors and related colors is required to be analyzed, and (3) the results of this research should expend into applications in association with emotional lighting. ope...|$|E
