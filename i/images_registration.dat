We extend here some results developed on a previous paper to multi-view images. For seabed characterization, we need to fuse the multi-view of sonar images to increase performances and build a complete mosaic. However, before fusion, we have to proceed to a classification of the data, and to an image registration. The proposed approach is based {{on the use of the}} conflict due to the combination as a dissimilarity measure in the classified <b>images</b> <b>registration.</b> The theory of belief functions allows an unique framework to model the imperfections and to fuse the classified images...|$|E

Here we are aiming to combine the MATLAB fminsearch optimization method with copula based alignment measure, in order to monitor the performance of copula based alignment measure in <b>image</b> <b>registration.</b> Performance of four copula functions namely, Clayton, Frank, Gaussian and Marshal-Olkin are tested in <b>image</b> <b>registration</b> algorithm. A comparison is then posited of the performance of the four copula functions in <b>image</b> <b>registration.</b> These four copula measures are then compared with the well known method of <b>image</b> <b>registration</b> alignment measure, that is the joint histogram based mutual information. The accuracy and speed of the <b>image</b> <b>registration</b> algorithm was monitored on aerial and medical (MRI) images.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. comRemote-sensing <b>images</b> <b>registration</b> is a fundamental task in image processing, which is concerned with establishment of correspondence between two or more pictures taken, for example, at different times, from different sensors, or from different viewpoints. Because of the different gray level characters in such remote-sensing images, it's difficult to match them automatically. We usually constrain the images to some particular categories, or do the job manually. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm for remote-sensing <b>images</b> <b>registration,</b> which takes {{full advantage of the}} shape information of the close-regions bounded by contours after detecting and linking the edges in images. Based on the shape-specific points of the close-regions, we match the close-regions by evaluating their matching degrees. Using the matched pairs of the close-regions, the geometric parameters for <b>images</b> <b>registration</b> are computed and this registration task can be performed automatically and accurately. This new algorithm works well for those images where the contour information is well preserved, such as the optical images from LANDSAT and SPOT satellites. Experiments verified our algorithm, and showed that the performance of executing it sequentially depends a lot {{on the size of the}} input images. The time complexity will increase exponentially as the size of images increases. So we extend the sequential algorithm to a distributed scheme and perform the registration task more efficiently.

40|$|In {{the field}} of medical imaging, <b>image</b> <b>registration</b> methods are useful for many {{applications}} such as inter- and intra-subject morphological comparisons, creation of population atlases, delivery of precision therapies, etc. A user may want to know {{which is the most}} suitable registration algorithm that would work best for the intended application, but the vastness of medical <b>image</b> <b>registration</b> applications makes evaluation and comparison of <b>image</b> <b>registration</b> performance a non-trivial task. In general, evaluating <b>image</b> <b>registration</b> performance is not straightforward because in most <b>image</b> <b>registration</b> applications there is an absence of “Gold Standard” or ground truth correspondence map to compare against. It is therefore the primary goal of this thesis work to provide a means for recommending the most appropriate registration algorithm for a given task. One of the contributions of this thesis is to examine <b>image</b> <b>registration</b> algorithm performance at the component level. Another contribution of this thesis is to catalog the benefits and limitations of many of the most commonly used <b>image</b> <b>registration</b> evaluation approaches. One incremental contribution of this thesis was to demonstrate how existing evaluation methods can be applied in the midpoint coordinate system to evaluate some symmetric <b>image</b> <b>registration</b> algorithms such as the SyN registration algorithm. Finally, a major contribution of this thesis was to develop tools to evaluate and visualize 2 D and 3 D <b>image</b> <b>registration</b> shape collapse.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} B-spline-based elastic <b>image</b> <b>registration</b> on adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AO-SLO) -assisted capillary visualization. Methods: AO-SLO videos were acquired from parafoveal areas {{in the eyes of}} healthy subjects and patients with various diseases. After nonlinear <b>image</b> <b>registration,</b> the <b>image</b> quality of capillary images constructed from AO-SLO videos using motion contrast enhancement was compared before and after B-spline-based elastic (nonlinear) <b>image</b> <b>registration</b> performed using ImageJ.
