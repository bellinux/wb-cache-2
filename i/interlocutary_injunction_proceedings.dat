Enforcing an injunction becomes problematic when other jurisdictions are involved, yet plaintiffs request such injunctions despite the potential inherent difficulties of cross-border enforcement. The author empirically analyzes the number and types of cross-border injunctions issued in the United States against foreign entities by discussing methods of enforcing injunctions abroad and the difficulties inherent in those methods. Comparing cases of cross-border injunctions issued by European courts, the author reviews the controversial pan-European injunction that covers not only the territory of other countries but also other countries 2 ̆ 7 patents. The author notes that while U. S. injunctions cross borders, they do not extend to foreign patents, whereas pan-European injunctions extend to domestic and foreign patents. Moreover, defendants may raise design-around arguments in <b>injunction</b> <b>proceedings,</b> which would require courts to decide whether the new product still infringes the patent, even though courts prefer not to interpret foreign patent claims and their scope. Recent case law suggests that courts should not adjudicate foreign patent infringements. In conclusion, the author encourages ongoing debate about international solutions that support a system for effective cross-border patent enforcement...|$|R

40|$|Prema novijoj sudskoj praksi Europskog suda za ljudska prava iz 2009. na privremene mjere, uključujući sudske zabrane, moguće je primijeniti članak 6., stavak 1. Konvencije za zaštitu ljudskih prava i temeljnih sloboda (pravo na pošteno suđenje). U presudi Micallef protiv Malte (2009.) Veliko vijeće ustanovilo je mjerila za ispitivanje suglasnosti prigovora o privremenim mjerama s člankom 6., stavkom 1. Konvencije ratione materiae. To se ispitivanje u praksi naziva provedbom testa Micallef. U radu se obrazlažu razlozi promjene sudske prakse Europskog suda u tom pitanju te se objašnjava način na koji se provodi test Micallef. In {{the case}} of Micallef v. Malta (judgment [GC], no. 17056 / 06, 15 October 2009) the European Court of Human Rights (hereinafter {{referred}} to as “the Court”) no longer finds it justified to automatically characterise <b>injunction</b> <b>proceedings</b> as non-determinative of civil rights or obligations. Nor is the Court convinced that a defect in such proceedings would necessarily be remedied at a later stage, namely, in proceedings on the merits governed by Article 6 since any prejudice suffered in the meantime may by then have become irreversible and with little realistic opportunity to redress the damage caused, except perhaps {{for the possibility of}} pecuniary compensation. In the Micallef judgment the Court thus considered that the fact that interim decisions which also determine civil rights and obligations were not protected by Article 6 under the Convention calls for a new approach, and that a change in the Court 2 ̆ 7 s case law is necessary. However, not all interim measures determine “civil rights and obligations” for the purpose of Article 6. So, the applicability of Article 6 will depend on whether certain conditions are fulfilled. First, the right at stake in both the main and the <b>injunction</b> <b>proceedings</b> should be “civil” within the autonomous meaning of that notion under Article 6 of the Convention. Second, the nature of the interim measure, its object and purpose as well as its effects on the right in question should be scrutinised. Whenever an interim measure can be considered effectively to determine civil right or obligation at stake, notwithstanding the length of time it is in force, Article 6 will be applicable. However, in exceptional cases – where, for example, the effectiveness of the measure sought depends upon a rapid decision-making process – it may not be possible immediately to comply with all of the requirements of Article 6. Thus, in such specific cases, while the independence and impartiality of the tribunal or the judge concerned is an indispensable and inalienable safeguard in such proceedings, other procedural safeguards may apply only to the extent compatible with the nature and purpose of the interim proceedings at issue. In any subsequent proceedings before the Court, it will fall to the Government to establish that, in view of the purpose of the proceedings at issue in a given case, one or more specific procedural safeguards could not be applied without unduly prejudicing the attainment of the objectives sought by the interim measure in question...|$|R

40|$|The {{insights}} from the responsive regulation literature present an intriguing model for IRS interaction with preparers, {{and provide a}} theoretical context for a more nuanced approach that the IRS could adopt when considering its return preparer strategies. To some extent, the IRS’s current emphasis on preparer education, including the significant resources expended on tax forums and other general outreach programs, reflects IRS awareness that its interaction with preparers must take a varied approach. In this paper, I propose a more personal contact paradigm with preparers, with those contacts facilitated by heightened identification requirements and a more dedicated IRS effort to mine preparer data and direct targeted communication and efforts reflective of the data it will capture. The proposed approach will contribute to greater preparer visibility, responsibility and competence, and will ultimately allow for the IRS and preparers to genuinely work together to improve the accurate reporting of information on tax returns, {{and make it more}} difficult for preparers to pass on inaccurate information to the IRS. A prerequisite for this type of approach is that the IRS must have sufficient information regarding who the good and who the bad actors are in the return preparation industry. There is a deep need for the IRS to collect information by type of preparer, and have a nuanced understanding of error rates by preparer and by issue, with a healthy dose of qualitative on the ground resources backstopping and contributing to understandings that the numbers suggest. Encouraging good behavior must start with the IRS knowing and acting on information about how certain preparers are interacting with taxpayers. Changing preparer conduct through audits, heightened penalties, and the use of civil <b>injunction</b> <b>proceedings</b> should come only after the IRS encourages more positive steps, and only after the IRS directs disapproval with what it perceives to be improper preparer conduct. Possible legislative change that would require registration and certification of preparers could also help facilitate effective oversight of the preparer community. This possible additional regulation could be the trigger for the IRS to meaningfully track information related to preparers and encourage better behavior, while at the same time keeping its powder dry for the egregious actors who need more traditional sanction-based approaches...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} {{preliminary}} injunctions (injunctive relief) in civil proceedings {{has not been}} monographically processed and published in the Czech Republic {{for more than one}} hundred years.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of interpleader {{depends upon the}} availability of <b>injunctions</b> against other <b>proceedings.</b> There is no congressional authorization of such injunctions for rule interpleader cases. If interpleader were an in rem action, {{one of the other}} exceptions to the Anti-Injunction Act might save the day, but the Supreme Court has apparently foreclosed that option. This article examines that three-sided conflict. Part II discusses the problem in greater depth, focusing first on how interpleader functions and why it depends on being “the only game in town. ” Part II next addresses the background and interpretation of the Anti-Injunction Act, exploring particularly the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s narrow interpretation the Act 2 ̆ 7 s provisions and discussing the federalism values that the Act and the Court seek to serve. Finally, Part II reviews interpleader 2 ̆ 7 s status as an in personam action. Even in setting out the problem, one can conceive of at least three potential solutions. One might simply acknowledge that injunctions are not available in rule interpleader actions. Alternatively, one might reverse the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s view of interpleader as an in personam action, recharacterizing it as in rem to get around the strictures of the Anti-Injunction Act. Finally, one might leave interpleader itself untouched but reinterpret the jurisdiction exception to the Anti-Injunction Act. Unfortunately, each of these solutions comes with an unpalatable price. Part III discusses the price of each solution. Part IV considers whether, despite the costs of each solution, Congress or the Court should adopt any of them or whether there is some other alternative. In fact, there are two alternatives. Recharacterizing interpleader as an in rem proceeding to fit it within the Anti-Injunction Act is possible, though not the best answer because it would require extended judicial effort to refine the courts 2 ̆ 7 jurisdictional treatment of in rem proceedings generally. This approach is anything but simple and easy to implement. The more elegant option is for Congress explicitly to authorize <b>injunctions</b> against state <b>proceedings</b> in rule interpleader actions, and Part IV offers language that does so...|$|R
