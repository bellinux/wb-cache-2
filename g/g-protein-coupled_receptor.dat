25|$|The G protein-coupled {{receptor}} kinases (GRKs) are protein kinases that phosphorylate only active GPCRs. <b>G-protein-coupled</b> <b>receptor</b> kinases (GRKs) are key modulators of <b>G-protein-coupled</b> <b>receptor</b> (GPCR) signaling. They {{constitute a}} family of seven mammalian serine-threonine protein kinases that phosphorylate agonist-bound receptor. GRKs-mediated receptor phosphorylation rapidly initiates profound impairment of receptor signaling and desensitization. Activity of GRKs and subcellular targeting is tightly regulated by interaction with receptor domains, G protein subunits, lipids, anchoring proteins and calcium-sensitive proteins.|$|E
25|$|Oxytocin has {{peripheral}} (hormonal) actions, {{and also}} has actions in the brain. Its actions are mediated by specific, oxytocin receptors. The oxytocin receptor is a <b>G-protein-coupled</b> <b>receptor</b> that requires magnesium and cholesterol. It belongs to the rhodopsin-type (class I) group of G-protein-coupled receptors.|$|E
40|$|<b>G-protein-coupled</b> <b>receptors</b> {{constitute}} one of {{the largest}} protein superfamilies in mammals. Since the cloning of the encoding genes, these important drug targets have been subjected to thorough biochemical and pharmacological studies. It has become clear that <b>G-protein-coupled</b> <b>receptors</b> not only transmit signals after stimulation by agonists but can also spontaneously couple to signal-transduction pathways. Recent findings show that constitutively active <b>G-protein-coupled</b> <b>receptors</b> can also be regulated in an agonist-independent manner, which has important implications for the interpretation of the actions of (inverse) agonists and the results of site-directed-mutagenesis studies.

25|$|A {{variety of}} retinal {{molecular}} pathway defects have been matched to multiple known RP gene mutations. Mutations in the rhodopsin gene, {{which is responsible}} for the majority of autosomal-dominantly inherited RP cases, disrupts the rod-opsin protein essential for translating light into decipherable electrical signals within the phototransduction cascade of the central nervous system. Defects in the activity of this <b>G-protein-coupled</b> <b>receptor</b> are classified into distinct classes that depend on the specific folding abnormality and the resulting molecular pathway defects. The Class I mutant protein's activity is compromised as specific point mutations in the protein-coding amino acid sequence affect the pigment protein's transportation into the outer segment of the eye, where the phototransduction cascade is localized. Additionally, the misfolding of Class II rhodopsin gene mutations disrupts the protein's conjunction with 11-cis-retinal to induce proper chromophore formation. Additional mutants in this pigment-encoding gene affect protein stability, disrupt mRNA integrity post-translationally, and affect the activation rates of transducin and opsin optical proteins.|$|E
2500|$|<b>G-protein-coupled</b> <b>receptor</b> oligomerisation is a {{widespread}} phenomenon. [...] One of the best-studied examples is the metabotropic GABAB receptor. This so-called constitutive receptor is formed by heterodimerization of GABABR1 and GABABR2 subunits. Expression of the GABABR1 without the GABABR2 in heterologous systems leads to retention of the subunit in the endoplasmic reticulum. [...] Expression of the GABABR2 subunit alone, meanwhile, leads to surface expression of the subunit, although with no functional activity (i.e., the receptor does not bind agonist and cannot initiate a response following exposure to agonist). Expression of the two subunits together leads to plasma membrane expression of functional receptor. [...] It {{has been shown that}} GABABR2 binding to GABABR1 causes masking of a retention signal of functional receptors.|$|E

40|$|<b>G-protein-coupled</b> <b>receptors</b> {{all share}} the seven transmembrane helix motif similar to bacteriorhodopsin. This {{similarity}} was exploited to build models for these receptors. From {{an analysis of}} a multi-sequence alignment of 225 <b>G-protein-coupled</b> <b>receptors</b> belonging to the rhodopsin-like superfamily, conclusions could be drawn about functional residues. Seven residues in the transmembrane regions are conserved throughout all aligned receptors. These residues cluster at the cytosolic side of the transmembrane helices and are for all rhodopsin-like <b>G-protein-coupled</b> <b>receptors</b> implied in signal transduction. An analysis of correlated mutations reveals a number of residues, both in the helices and in the cytosolic loops, that might be important in the signal transduction pathway in subfamilies of this receptor family.

40|$|The {{structures}} of the seven transmembrane helices of <b>G-protein-coupled</b> <b>receptors</b> are critically involved in many aspects of these receptors, such as receptor stability, ligand docking, and molecular function. Most of the previous multitemplate approaches have built a “super” template with very little merging of aligned fragments from different templates. Here, we present a parallelized multitemplate approach, patGPCR, to predict the 3 D {{structures of}} transmembrane helices of <b>G-protein-coupled</b> <b>receptors.</b> patGPCR, which employs a bundle-packing related energy function that extends on the RosettaMem energy, parallelizes eight pipelines for transmembrane helix refinement and exchanges the optimized helix structures from multiple templates. We have investigated the performance of patGPCR on a test set containing eight determined <b>G-protein-coupled</b> <b>receptors.</b> The results indicate that patGPCR improves the TM RMSD of the predicted models by 33. 64 % on average against a single-template method.
