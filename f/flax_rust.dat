A second and much greater increase in the activity of this enzyme occurred only in the susceptible host at later stages of disease development.

40|$|Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini is a hemibiotrophic fungus {{that causes}} wilt in <b>flax.</b> Along with <b>rust,</b> {{fusarium}} wilt {{has become an}} important factor in flax production worldwide. Resistant flax cultivars have been used to manage the disease, but the resistance varies, depending on the interactions between specific cultivars and isolates of the pathogen. This interaction has a strong molecular basis, but no genomic information is available on how the plant responds to attempted infection, to inform breeding programs on potential candidate genes to evaluate or improve resistance across cultivars. In the current study, disease progression in two flax cultivars (CDC Bethune and Lutea), showed earlier disease symptoms and higher susceptibility in the later cultivar. Chitinase gene expression was also divergent and demonstrated and earlier molecular response in Lutea. The most resistant cultivar (CDC Bethune) was used for a full RNA-seq transcriptome study through a time-course at 2, 4, 8 and 18 days post-inoculation (DPI). While over 100 genes were significantly differentially expressed at both 4 and 8 DPI, the broadest deployment of plant defense responses was evident at 18 DPI with transcripts of more than 1, 000 genes responding to the treatment. These genes evidenced a reception and transduction of pathogen signals, a large transcriptional reprogramming, induction of hormone signalling, activation of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, and changes in secondary metabolism. Among these several key genes, that consistently appear in studies of plant-pathogen interactions, had increased transcript abundance in our study, and constitute suitable candidates for resistance breeding programs. These included: an induced RPMI-induced protein kinase (RIPK); transcription factors WRKY 3, WRKY 70, WRKY 75, MYB 113 and MYB 108; the ethylene response factors ERF 1 and ERF 14; two genes involved in auxin/glucosinolate precursor synthesis (CYP 79 B 2 and CYP 79 B 3); the flavonoid-related enzymes chalcone synthase, dihydroflavonol reductase and multiple anthocyanidin synthases; and a peroxidase implicated in lignin formation (PRX 52). Additionally, regulation of some genes indicated potential pathogen manipulation to facilitate infection; these included four disease resistance proteins that were repressed, indole acetic acid amido/amino hydrolases which were upregulated, activated expansins and glucanases, amino acid transporters and aquaporins, and finally, repression of major latex proteins...|$|R

Resistance of flax (Linum usitatissimum) to <b>flax</b> <b>rust</b> (Melampsora lini) involves the induction of a hypersensitive cell death response at haustoria formation sites, governed by gene-for-gene recognition between host resistance and pathogen avirulence genes. We identified genes encoding haustorially expressed secreted proteins (HESPs) by screening a <b>flax</b> <b>rust</b> haustorium-specific cDNA library. Among 429 unigenes, 21 HESPs were identified, one corresponding to the AvrL 567 gene. Three other HESPs cosegregated with the independent AvrM, AvrP 4, and AvrP 123 loci. Expression of these genes in flax induced resistance gene–mediated cell death with the appropriate specificity, confirming their avirulence activity. AvrP 4 and AvrP 123 are Cys-rich proteins, and AvrP 123 contains a Kazal Ser protease inhibitor signature, whereas AvrM contains no Cys residues. AvrP 4 and AvrM induce cell death when expressed intracellularly, suggesting their translocation into plant cells during infection. However, secreted AvrM and AvrP 4 also induce necrotic responses, with secreted AvrP 4 more active than intracellular AvrP 4, possibly {{as a result of}} enhanced formation of endoplasmic reticulum–dependent disulfide bonds.

Of these fungi, the <b>flax</b> <b>rust</b> pathogen Melampsora lini {{has been developed}} extensively over the past 80 years as a model to understand the molecular mechanisms that underpin pathogenesis. During infection, M. lini secretes virulence effectors to promote disease. The number of these effectors, their function and their degree of conservation across rust fungal species is unknown. To assess this, we sequenced and assembled de novo the genome of M. lini isolate CH 5 into 21, 130 scaffolds spanning 189 Mbp (scaffold N 50 of 31 kbp). Global analysis of the DNA sequence revealed that repetitive elements, primarily retrotransposons, make up at least 45 % of the genome. Using ab initio predictions, transcriptome data and homology searches, we identified 16, 271 putative protein-coding genes. An analysis pipeline was then implemented to predict the effector complement of M. lini and compare it {{to that of the}} poplar rust, wheat stem rust and wheat stripe rust pathogens to identify conserved and species-specific effector candidates. Previous knowledge of four cloned M. lini avirulence effector proteins and two basidiomycete effectors was used to optimise parameters of the effector prediction pipeline. Markov clustering based on sequence similarity was performed to group effector candidates from all four rust pathogens. Clusters containing at least one member from M. lini were further analysed and prioritized based on features including expression in isolated haustoria and infected leaf tissue and conservation across rust species. Herein, we describe 200 of 940 clusters that ranked highest on our priority list, representing 725 <b>flax</b> <b>rust</b> candidate effectors.

However, replacement of the L 10 TIR-encoding region with the TIR-encoding region of L 2 gave rise to an allele with no detectable specificity.

Further, N-terminal sequences that were sufficient for uptake were identified for both these proteins. In light of the possibility that the internalization of fungal and oomycete effectors may require binding to specific phospholipids, the lipid binding activities of AvrM and AvrL 567 mutants with different abilities to enter cells were tested. While AvrL 567 was not found to bind to phospholipids, AvrM bound strongly to phosphatidyl inositol, phosphatidyl inositol monophosphates and phosphatidyl serine. However, a fragment of AvrM sufficient to direct uptake of a fusion protein into plant cells did not bind to these phospholipids.

40|$|The {{pioneering}} {{research of}} Harold Flor on flax and the <b>flax</b> <b>rust</b> fungus culminated in his gene-for-gene hypothesis. It took nearly 50 {{years before the}} first fungal avirulence (Avr) gene {{in support of his}} hypothesis was cloned. Initially, fungal Avr genes were identified by reverse genetics and map-based cloning from model organisms, but, currently, the availability of many sequenced fungal genomes allows their cloning from additional fungi by a combination of comparative and functional genomics. It is believed that most Avr genes encode effectors that facili-tate virulence by suppressing pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity and induce effector-triggered immu-nity in plants containing cognate resistance proteins. In resistant plants, effectors are directly or indirectly recognized by cognate resistance proteins that reside either on the plasma membrane or inside the plant cell. Indirect recognition of an effector (also known as the guard model) implies that the virulence target of an effector in the host (the guardee) is guarded by the resistance protein (the guard) that senses manipulation of the guardee, leading to activation of effector-triggered immunity. In this article, we review the literature on fungal effectors and some pathogen-associated molecular patterns, including those of some fungi for which no gene-for-gene relationship has been established. mpp_ 591 735 [...] 74...|$|E

The extremely low level of this class of R proteins found in plant tissue has precluded their biochemical and structural analysis, {{and the study of}} these proteins has been largely restricted to genetic analyses and in vivo investigations.

Expression trials with five different constructs reveals optimum levels of soluble native M protein can be obtained as an N-terminally 9 x His-tagged protein, in which the first 21 amino acids of the predicted wild-type protein are deleted. Expression was achieved using a high cell density fed-batch bioreactor culture at low temperature. M protein was purified to near homogeneity from whole-cell lysates using cation exchange, immobilised metal ion affinity chromatography and gel filtration with a final yield of approximately 3 mg of protein/ 1000 g wet weight of yeast cells lysed.

40|$|NOD-like receptors (NLRs) {{are central}} {{components}} of the plant immune system. L 6 is a Toll/interleukin- 1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing NLR from flax (Linum usitatissimum) conferring immunity to the <b>flax</b> <b>rust</b> fungus. Comparison of L 6 to the weaker allele L 7 identified two polymorphic regions in the TIR and the nucleotide binding (NB) domains that regulate both effector ligand-dependent and -independent cell death signaling as well as nucleotide binding to the receptor. This suggests that a negative functional interaction between the TIR and NB domains holds L 7 in an inactive/ADP-bound state more tightly than L 6, hence decreasing its capacity to adopt the active/ATP-bound state and explaining its weaker activity in planta. L 6 and L 7 variants with a more stable ADP-bound state failed to bind to AvrL 567 in yeast two-hybrid assays, while binding was detected to the signaling active variants. This contrasts with current models predicting that effectors bind to inactive receptors to trigger activation. Based on the correlation between nucleotide binding, effector interaction, and immune signaling properties of L 6 /L 7 variants, we propose that NLRs exist in an equilibrium between ON and OFF states and that effector binding to the ON state stabilizes this conformation, thereby shifting the equilibrium toward the active form of the receptor to trigger defense signaling...|$|E

AvrM is a secreted effector protein from <b>flax</b> <b>rust</b> (Melampsora lini) that can internalize into plant cells {{in the absence of the}} pathogen, binds to phosphoinositides (PIPs), and is recognized directly by the resistance protein M in flax (Linum usitatissimum), resulting in effector-triggered immunity. We determined the crystal structures of two naturally occurring variants of AvrM, AvrM-A and avrM, and both reveal an L-shaped fold consisting of a tandem duplicated four-helix motif, which displays similarity to the WY domain core in oomycete effectors. In the crystals, both AvrM variants form a dimer with an unusual nonglobular shape. Our functional analysis of AvrM reveals that a hydrophobic surface patch conserved between both variants is required for internalization into plant cells, whereas the C-terminal coiled-coil domain mediates interaction with M. AvrM binding to PIPs is dependent on positive surface charges, and mutations that abrogate PIP binding have no significant effect on internalization, suggesting that AvrM binding to PIPs is not essential for transport of AvrM across the plant membrane. The structure of AvrM and the identification of functionally important surface regions advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying how effectors enter plant cells and how they are detected by the plant immune system...|$|E

L 5 and L 6 are two alleles of the L locus that directly recognize variants of the fungal effector AvrL 567. In this study, we have investigated the molecular details of this recognition by site-directed mutagenesis of AvrL 567 and construction of chimeric L proteins. Single, double and triple mutations of polymorphic residues {{in a variety of}} AvrL 567 variants showed additive effects on recognition strength, suggesting that multiple contact points are involved in recognition. Domain-swap experiments between L 5 and L 6 show that specificity differences are determined by their corresponding LRR regions. Most positively selected amino acid sites occur in the N- and C-terminal LRR units, and polymorphisms in the first seven and last four LRR units contribute to recognition specificity of L 5 and L 6 respectively. This further confirms that multiple, additive contact points occur between AvrL 567 variants and either L 5 or L 6. However, we also observed that recognition of AvrL 567 is affected by co-operative polymorphisms between both adjacent and distant domains of the R protein, including the TIR, ARC and LRR domains, implying that these residues are involved in intramolecular interactions to optimize detection of the pathogen and defense signal activation.

Although indirect recognition imposes selection against Avr effector function, pathogen effector molecules recognized through direct interaction may overcome resistance through sequence diversification rather than loss of function. Here we show that the <b>flax</b> <b>rust</b> fungus AvrL 567 genes, whose products are recognized by the L 5, L 6, and L 7 R proteins of flax, are highly diverse, with 12 sequence variants identified from six rust strains. Seven AvrL 567 variants derived from Avr alleles induce necrotic responses when expressed in flax plants containing corresponding resistance genes (R genes), whereas five variants from avr alleles do not. Differences in recognition specificity between AvrL 567 variants and evidence for diversifying selection acting on these genes suggest they {{have been involved in}} a gene-specific arms race with the corresponding flax R genes. Yeast two-hybrid assays indicate that recognition is based on direct R–Avr protein interaction and recapitulate the interaction specificity observed in planta. Biochemical analysis of Escherichia coli-produced AvrL 567 proteins shows that variants that escape recognition nevertheless maintain a conserved structure and stability, suggesting that the amino acid sequence differences directly affect the R–Avr protein interaction. We suggest that direct recognition associated with high genetic diversity at corresponding R and Avr gene loci represents an alternative outcome of plant–pathogen coevolution to indirect recognition associated with simple balanced polymorphisms for functional and nonfunctional R and Avr genes...|$|E

Large-scale sequencing (454 -GS-FLEX Titanium) of mixed coffee and rust cDNAs obtained from 21 -day rust-infected leaves generated 352 146 sequences which assembled into 22 774 contigs.

About 30 % (6763) of the contigs were assigned to H. vastatrix and 61 % (13 951) to C. arabica. The majority (60 %) of the rust sequences did not show homology to any genomic database, indicating that they were potential novel fungal genes.

Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated transient expression of the mature AvrL 567 -A or AvrL 567 -B (but not AvrL 567 -C) proteins as intracellular products in L. usitatissimum and Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) induced a hypersensitive response–like necrosis that was dependent on coexpression of the L 5, L 6, or L 7 resistance gene. An F 1 seedling lethal or stunted growth phenotype also was observed when transgenic L. usitatissimum plants expressing AvrL 567 -A or AvrL 567 -B (but not AvrL 567 -C) were crossed to resistant lines containing L 5, L 6, or L 7. The AvrL 567 genes are expressed in rust haustoria and encode 127 amino acid secreted proteins. Intracellular recognition of these rust avirulence proteins implies that they are delivered into host cells across the plant membrane. Differences in the three AvrL 567 protein sequences result from diversifying selection, which is consistent with a coevolutionary arms race...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici is an obligate biotrophic {{pathogen}} {{that causes}} leaf stripe rust on wheat. Although {{it is critical}} to understand molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis in the wheat stripe rust fungus for developing novel disease management strategies, little is known about its genome and gene functions due to difficulties in molecular studies with this important pathogen. To identify genes expressed during early infection stages, in this study we constructed a cDNA library with RNA isolated from urediniospores of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici germinated for 10 h. Results A total of 4798 ESTs were sequenced from the germinated urediniospore library and assembled into 315 contigs and 803 singletons. About 23. 9 % and 13. 3 % of the resulting 1118 unisequences were homologous to functionally characterized proteins and hypothetical proteins, respectively. The rest 62. 8 % unisequences had no significant homologs in GenBank. Several of these ESTs shared significant homology with known fungal pathogenicity or virulence factors, such as HESP 767 of the <b>flax</b> <b>rust</b> and PMK 1, GAS 1, and GAS 2 of the rice blast fungus. We selected six ESTs (Ps 28, Ps 85, Ps 87, Ps 259, Ps 261, and Ps 159) for assaying their expression patterns during urediniospore germination and wheat infection by quantitative real-time PCR. All of them had the highest transcript level in germinated urediniospores and a much less transcript level in un-germinated urediniospores and infected wheat tissues (1 – 7 dpi). The transcript level of Ps 159 increased at later infection stages (6 – 7 dpi). Our data indicated that these genes were highly expressed in germinated urediniospores and may play important roles in fungal-plant interactions during early infection stages in the wheat stripe rust fungus. Conclusion Genes expressed in germinated urediniospores of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici were identified by EST analysis. Six of them were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR assays to be highly expressed in germinated urediniospores. </p...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{resurgence}} of wheat stem rust caused by new virulent races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) {{poses a threat}} to food security. These concerns have catalyzed an extensive global effort towards controlling this disease. Substantial research and breeding programs target the identification and introduction of new stem rust resistance (Sr) genes in cultivars for genetic protection against the disease. Such resistance genes typically encode immune receptor proteins that recognize specific components of the pathogen, known as avirulence (Avr) proteins. A significant drawback to deploying cultivars with single Sr genes is that they are often overcome by evolution of the pathogen to escape recognition through alterations in Avr genes. Thus, a key element in achieving durable rust control is the deployment of multiple effective Sr genes in combination, either through conventional breeding or transgenic approaches, to minimize the risk of resistance breakdown. In this situation, evolution of pathogen virulence would require simultaneous changes in multiple Avr genes in order to bypass recognition. However, choosing the optimal Sr gene combinations to deploy is a challenge that requires detailed knowledge of the pathogen Avr genes with which they interact and the virulence phenotypes of Pgt existing in nature. Identifying specific Avr genes from Pgt will provide screening tools to enhance pathogen virulence monitoring, assess heterozygosity and propensity for mutation in pathogen populations, and confirm individual Sr gene functions in crop varieties carrying multiple effective resistance genes. Towards this goal, much {{progress has been made in}} assembling a high quality reference genome sequence for Pgt, as well as a Pan-genome encompassing variation between multiple field isolates with diverse virulence spectra. In turn this has allowed prediction of Pgt effector gene candidates based on known features of Avr genes in other plant pathogens, including the related <b>flax</b> <b>rust</b> fungus. Up regulation of gene expression in haustoria and evidence for diversifying selection are two useful parameters to identify candidate Avr genes. Recently, we have also applied machine learning approaches to agnostically predict candidate effectors. Here, we review progress in stem rust pathogenomics and approaches currently underway to identify Avr genes recognized by whea...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{diseases}} {{are a major}} issue for economically important crops. Plant immunity is usually triggered by the recognition of a pathogen effector protein by a plant resistance (R) protein, leading to the activation of plant defenses and a localized cell death response. The effectors are structurally diverse {{and they have been}} shown to be involved in both virulence and suppression of basal immune responses. R proteins are structurally conserved and the majority of them have a central nucleotide binding (NB) domain, a C-terminal leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain and either a coiled coil (CC), or Toll/Interleukin-receptor like (TIR) domain at the N-terminus. The LRR domain appears to be involved in both recognition of the effector proteins and negative regulation, while the NB and TIR domains are required for R protein activation and initiation of defence signalling, respectively. The molecular and structural basis of R protein effector recognition, activation and signalling is poorly understood. In this study I have used the interaction between flax and the fungal pathogen flax-rust as a model system to characterize this process. This is a power full model system for studying the structural basis of plant disease resistance. Several flax R-genes and corresponding <b>flax</b> <b>rust</b> effector-genes have been identified, and the effector proteins AvrL 567 and AvrM have been shown to interact directly with the R proteins L 6 and M, respectively. The crystal structure of AvrL 567 has also been solved. In the first part of this study I report on structural characterization of flax R proteins. The 2 nd chapter of the thesis describes a high-throughput strategy that was employed to screen for constructs that can produce soluble R proteins and fragments in E. coli. This resulted in identification of several TIR domain constructs that yielded soluble protein in both sufficient quality and quantity required for structural studies. The 3 rd and the 4 th chapter describe crystallization, structure determination, and structural analysis of the L 6 TIR domain. The structure reveals important differences from the structures of mammalian TIR domains, and highlights three separate functionally important protein surfaces, involved in dimerisation, interaction with a downstream signalling partner, and regulatory intramolecular interactions, respectively. In the second part of the thesis I report on the structural characterization of two different variants of the secreted flax-rust effector AvrM. One of these variants AvrM-A, is recognized by the M resistance protein in flax, which results in activation of a necrotic immune response. The second variant avrM, is not detected by M and promotes disease. The 5 th chapter reveals that AvrM has a !-helical fold, exists as a dimer in solution and has a C-terminal structured domain. This chapter also describes crystallisation and structure determination of the C-terminal domain of both AvrM variants. In the 6 th chapter refined structures of the two AvrM variants are reported. Both structures have a novel L-shaped helical fold, with two chains forming an anti-parallel dimer with an unusual non-globular shape. Analysis of the two structures provides insight into the molecular basis of cell entry, and the direct interaction with flax R proteins. In summary, this thesis has made a significant contribution towards our understanding of effector recognition, and the structural mechanisms behind initiation of R protein defence signalling. Our results bring us a step closer to understanding the molecular basis for the disease resistance process in plants, which is a prerequisite for the future engineering of novel resistance specificities into commercially important crops...|$|E
40|$|Plants are {{not able}} to move or escape and have to confront {{environmental}} challenges like nutrient and water deprivation, low and high temperatures, and biotic stress imposed by pathogens like viruses, bacteria, fungi, nematodes and insects that all compete for plant nutrient sources. The outcome of a plant-pathogen interaction can vary from mild symptoms that are hardly harmful to the host to complete destruction of the host plant. Plants have evolved various mechanisms to counter-attack infections by pathogens. Mechanisms of evasion or suppression of basal host defense by pathogens on the one hand, and specific recognition of a pathogen by its host and activation of downstream defense signaling on the other hand, are complex and both organisms {{have to come up with}} sophisticated strategies to survive their encounters. In principle these encounters have two possible outcomes: (i) a pathogen successfully infects the host plant, which is also referred to as a compatible interaction (the pathogen is virulent and the host plant is susceptible), or (ii) the pathogen cannot successfully infect the host plant which stays healthy, also referred to as an incompatible interaction (the pathogen is avirulent and the host plant is resistant). Nearly 70 years ago, Harold Flor (1942) studied the genetics of the interaction between the <b>flax</b> <b>rust</b> fungus Melampsora lini and flax, Linum usitatissimum. Based on these studies he postulated the so-called gene-for-gene hypothesis (Flor 1942) which states that for each dominant resistance (R) gene in the host there is a matching dominant avirulence (Avr) gene in the pathogen. Co-occurrence and expression of both genes leads to an incompatible interaction that is often associated with a hypersensitive response (HR). The interaction between the fungus Cladosporium fulvum (syn. Passalora fulva) and the host tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is an excellent model to study plant-pathogen interactions and obeys to the gene-for-gene hypothesis. C. fulvum is a biotrophic pathogen that causes leaf mold of tomato, avoids breaching the cell wall and exclusively colonizes the tomato leaf apoplast while establishing a long-term feeding relationship with the living cells of the host. During the infection process, the fungus secretes several effector molecules, relatively small, cysteine–rich proteins. They are likely to contribute to pathogen fitness and play a role in pathogen virulence. According to the 'Zig-Zag' model that explains the evolutionary development of plant-pathogen interactions, effectors are required for ETS (effector -triggered susceptibility). Tomato plants that carry cognate Cf resistance genes recognize the effector and elicit a defense response known as the hypersensitive response (HR), nowadays known as effector-triggered immunity (ETI). In this thesis I have focused on several molecular and biochemical aspects of the Avr 2 and Cf- 2 gene pair and on an additional gene, Rcr 3 (required for Cladosporium resistance), that is required for Cf- 2 -mediated resistance with an emphasis on the role of Avr 2 in ETS and ETI in the C. fulvum-tomato interaction. The gene-for-gene hypothesis postulated by Harrold Flor has inspired many plant pathologists and initiated numerous plant-pathogen studies as discussed in chapter 1. This hypothesis has lead to the characterization of various host plant R genes and cognate pathogen Avr genes from fungi, bacteria and oomycetes. Plant resistance proteins are the basic molecules that mediate a defense reaction, triggered by cognate effectors directed against the pathogens, are found extracellularly as well as intracellularly and are divided in classes based on the composition of different subdomains that may have various functions. Particularly the LRR domain(s) are involved in recognition, regulating protein activation and signal transduction and are highly adjustable in diverse binding specificities to self and non-self molecules. The nucleotide binding (NB) domain acts a switch for activation of downstream host defenses, often resulting in HR. Inappropriate R protein folding and activation is controlled by intramolecular interactions between the various domains and by hetero-multimeric protein complexes. Studies on interactions of plants, especially Arabidopsis thaliana, with prokaryotic pathogens have resulted in major scientific breakthroughs with respect to the gene-for-gene hypothesis. Research on the bacterial Type Three Secretion System and the delivery of the effectors has indentified sophisticated mechanisms for perception and recognition of pathogens and regulation of host resistance. The functions of effectors of eukaryotic plant pathogens remain largely unknown so far. Oomycete pathogens such as Phytophthora infestans produce various types of effectors during infection of their hosts. One class of oomycete effectors localizes to, and operates in, the extracellular matrix while the other class acts inside the host plant cell. Recent studies on the interaction of the <b>flax</b> <b>rust</b> fungus Melampsora lini with flax (Linum usitatissimum) has revealed a number of direct Avr-R protein interactions in vitro. These interactions are expected to occur in the haustorial matrix which is produced by the fungus during host infection. Secreted Avr proteins of C. fulvum interact exclusively with the corresponding extracellular Cf proteins of tomato. The C. fulvum-tomato pathosystem is one of the most well-studied plant pathogen interactions and revealed important insights in perception and recognition of Avr proteins. For many years it was assumed that the interactions beween C. fulvum Avrs and tomato R proteins occurred in a direct manner, but proof for such interactions has never been obtained. Indirect interactions were more likely and obeyed to the guard hypothesis wherein the Avr protein interacts with a host target and this interaction is monitored, or guarded, by the Cf- protein. Chapter 2 reports on the avirulence function of Avr 2 in the Cf- 2 -mediated resistance that also requires the extracellular tomato cysteine protease Rcr 3. The interaction between Avr 2, Cf- 2 and Rcr 3 obeys to the guard hypothesis. Purified heterologously expressed and affinity-tagged Rcr 3 and Avr 2 were applied in co-immunoprecipitation assays and revealed a physical interaction between Avr 2 and Rcr 3 independent of additional plant and or fungal factors. It is shown that Avr 2 binds and inhibits Rcr 3, and blocking of the active site of Rcr 3 by the irreversible cysteine protease inhibitor E- 64 eliminates this interaction. The interaction with and the inhibition of Rcr 3 by Avr 2 occurs in a pH-dependent fashion and the pH optimum for Rcr 3 activity and its inhibition by Avr 2 coincides with the pH of the tomato apoplast. Cysteine protease activity profiling showed that, in addition to Rcr 3, Avr 2 inhibits several other apoplastic cysteine proteases in tomato, but this inhibition did not lead to Cf- 2 -mediated HR. Infiltration of purified active Rcr 3, or E- 64 -inactivated Rcr 3, in combination with Avr 2 in Cf- 2 /rcr 3 tomato leaves revealed that only the Avr 2 -Rcr 3 inhibition complex triggers Cf- 2 -dependent HR. It is proposed that Avr 2 modifies Rcr 3 which is recognized by Cf- 2 and initiates the HR. This study represents the first indirect fungus-plant gene-for-gene interaction that obeys to the guard hypothesis. In chapter 3 the focus is on the virulence function of Avr 2, and it is demonstrated that Avr 2 has an indisputable intrinsic biological virulence function for C. fulvum during infection of tomato. Silencing of the Avr 2 gene in C. fulvum significantly compromised fungal virulence on tomato. Heterologous expression of Avr 2 in tomato resulted in enhanced susceptibility towards natural Avr 2 -defective C. fulvum strains, but also towards Botrytis cinerea and Verticillium dahliae. In A. thaliana, Avr 2 expression resulted in enhanced susceptibility to various extracellular fungal pathogens including Botrytis cinerea and Verticillium dahliae. Microarray analysis of unchallenged A. thaliana plants showed that Avr 2 expression induced a global transcription profile that is comparable to the profile upon pathogen challenge. Cysteine protease activity profiling and LC-MS/MS analyses showed that Avr 2 inhibits multiple extracellular A. thaliana cysteine proteases. Similar results were obtained for tomato, showing that Avr 2 inhibits multiple cysteine proteases including Rcr 3 and its close relative Pip 1. This all shows that Avr 2 is a genuine virulence factor of C. fulvum that inhibits several cysteine proteases that are required for basal host defense. In chapter 4 the emphasis is on Avr 2 protein features and the mode of inhibition of Rcr 3. Like many other Avr genes, Avr 2 lacks homology with sequences deposited in public databases. The mature Avr 2 protein contains 8 cysteine residues and biochemical analyses revealed that all of these are involved in disulphide bridging, showing a unique disulphide bridge pattern. Based on a bioinformatics analysis, site-specific mutations were made in the Avr 2 protein and affinity-tagged wild-type and mutant proteins were produced by heterologous expression in the yeast Pichia pastoris. After affinity purification, all proteins were infiltrated in tomato Cf- 2 plants, and proteins with altered HR inducing activity were tested for their ability to inhibit Rcr 3. From these assays it became evident that especially the C-terminal six amino acids that also include one disulphide bridge are essential for the interaction with and inhibition of Rcr 3. All these data show that Avr 2 is a novel type of cysteine protease inhibitor. Chapter 5 is a general discussion about the role of plant cysteine proteases and cysteine protease inhibitors in plant-pathogen interactions. Microbial pathogens and host plants both employ cysteine proteases and cysteine protease inhibitors as weapons for attack and defence. This so-called arms race has led to multiple attacks and counter-attacks that have shaped co-evolution between pathogens and their host plants. Examples of some prokaryotic plant pathogens that employ cysteine proteases as effector proteins to suppress plant defense will be discussed, in addition to some eukaryotic pathogens that use cysteine protease inhibitors for the same purpose. Examples of plant cysteine proteases will be discussed that are involved in multiple processes including plant development, plant defense and processes in programmed cell death...|$|E
