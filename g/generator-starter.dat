5000|$|Power {{came from}} a , [...] split-single {{two-stroke}} motorcycle engine. The engine was started by a combination <b>generator-starter</b> known as Dynastart. A manual gearbox provided four forward speeds and reverse. A chain drive connected the gearbox to a solid rear axle {{with a pair of}} closely spaced 25 cm rear wheels. The first prototypes had one wheel at the rear, but having a single rear wheel made the car prone to roll-overs, so the rear wheel layout was changed to two wheels set 48 cm apart from each other. This narrow track eliminated the need for a differential. The front axle was a modified version of a Dubonnet independent front suspension. The Isetta took over 30 seconds to reach 50 km/h from rest. Top speed was only about 75 km/h. The fuel tank held only 13 L. However, the Isetta would get somewhere between 50 mpgimp and 70 mpgimp depending on how it was driven.In 1954, Iso entered several Isettas in the legendary Mille Miglia where they took the top three spots in the economy classification. Over a distance of 1600 km the drivers achieved an average speed of over 70 km/h. In view of its maximum speed, which was just 15 km/h higher, this was an almost incredible figure. However, despite its initial success, the Isetta was beginning to slip in popularity at home. This was mainly due to renewed competition from Fiat with its 500C model.|$|E
