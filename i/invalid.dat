5|$|On June 13, 1781, Nicola and the <b>Invalid</b> Corps {{was given}} the order by Congress to move to West Point, New York. This, however, was {{difficult}} to accomplish. On June 26, Nicola {{wrote a letter to}} George Washington that the Corps would not move until a replacement unit could take over for them. Another reason hindering the move was pay; the Corps did not receive a payment for nearly ten months. A compromise was later reached between Nicola and the Board of War that six months pay would be given to the <b>Invalid</b> Corps. After their leave to Pennsylvania, John David Woelper, a captain of the <b>Invalid</b> Corps, sent a letter to Washington on July 20, 1781 claiming Nicola was treating the Corps badly. In the note, Woelper requested Nicola's arrest. Nicola sent letters about the situation to Washington, who wanted to have it settled as soon as the Corps arrived at West Point. Washington, who did not show any favoritism to either, sent both series of letters to General Alexander McDougall and asked the court in West Point to settle the matter.|$|E

50|$|The {{regiment}} {{was raised}} by Colonel Edmund Fielding in March 1719 as Edmund Fielding's Regiment of Foot out of independent companies of <b>invalids</b> and Chelsea out-pensioners - soldiers incapable of normal service through disease, age or injury. For much of its early history the regiment undertook garrison duties at Portsmouth. It was renamed the Royal <b>Invalids</b> in 1741, and it was numbered the 41st Regiment of Foot in 1751. In 1782, when other regiments took county titles, it was denoted as the 41st (Royal <b>Invalids)</b> Regiment of Foot; in 1787 it ceased to comprise <b>invalids</b> and became a conventional line regiment, dropping the title. On 23 January 1788, Arthur Wesley, the future Duke of Wellington, joined the regiment as a young lieutenant.|$|R

5|$|The TRIM command {{also needs}} {{the support of}} the SSD. If the {{firmware}} in the SSD does not have support for the TRIM command, the LBAs received with the TRIM command will not be marked as <b>invalid</b> and the drive will continue to garbage collect the data assuming it is still valid. Only when the OS saves new data into those LBAs will the SSD know to mark the original LBA as <b>invalid.</b> SSD Manufacturers that did not originally build TRIM support into their drives can either offer a firmware upgrade to the user, or provide a separate utility that extracts the information on the <b>invalid</b> data from the OS and separately TRIMs the SSD. The benefit would be realized only after each run of that utility by the user. The user could set up that utility to run periodically in the background as an automatically scheduled task.|$|E
5|$|The court {{declared}} that Hill was not validly elected at the 1998 federal election. However, {{they did not}} declare the whole election <b>invalid,</b> acting on an earlier decision of the court, because although no effect could be given to voters' preferences for Hill, their other preferences were not <b>invalid,</b> and those {{could be used to}} determine who should be elected in Hill's stead. The court did not reach a definite decision about what action should be taken, remitting that question to a lower court. Eventually, Len Harris, the number two candidate on the One Nation ticket, was elected in Hill's stead, taking up his seat on 1 July 1999.|$|E
5|$|The {{superorder}} Selachimorpha {{is divided}} into Galea (or Galeomorphii), and Squalea (or Squalomorphii). The Galeans are the Heterodontiformes, Orectolobiformes, Lamniformes, and Carcharhiniformes. Lamnoids and Carcharhinoids are usually placed in one clade, but recent studies show the Lamnoids and Orectoloboids are a clade. Some scientists now think that Heterodontoids may be Squalean. The Squaleans are divided into Hexanchoidei and Squalomorpha. The Hexanchoidei includes the Hexanchiformes and Chlamydoselachiformes. The Squalomorpha contains the Squaliformes and the Hypnosqualea. The Hypnosqualea may be <b>invalid.</b> It includes the Squatiniformes, and the Pristorajea, which may also be <b>invalid,</b> but includes the Pristiophoriformes and the Batoidea.|$|E
