On one hand, an autoregressive moving average model, a smooth transition autoregressive model and three different neural networks architectures, namely a multi-layer perceptron, recurrent neural network and a psi sigma network are used as benchmarks for our radial basis function neural network. On the other hand, our forecast combination methods are benchmarked with a simple average and a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The statistical performance of our models is estimated throughout the period of 1972 – 2012, using the last 7  years for out-of-sample testing. The results show that the radial basis function neural network statistically outperforms all models’ individual performances. The forecast combinations are successful, since both Kalman <b>filter</b> <b>and</b> <b>support</b> vector regression techniques improve the statistical accuracy. Finally, support vector regression is found to be the superior model of the forecasting competition.

Some predic- tors use delay and throughput jointly to take advantage of the possible relationship between PPMs, while other pre- dictors consider PPMs individually.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} is to {{demonstrate}} the capability of Kalman Filter to reduce Support Vector Machine classification errors in classifying pipeline corrosion depth. In pipeline defect classification, it is important to increase the accuracy of the SVM classification so that one can avoid misclassification which can lead to greater problems in monitoring pipeline defect and prediction of pipeline leakage. In this paper, it is found that noisy data can greatly affect the performance of SVM. Hence, Kalman Filter + SVM hybrid technique has been proposed as a solution to reduce SVM classification errors. The datasets has been added with Additive White Gaussian Noise in several stages to study the effect of noise on SVM classification accuracy. Three techniques have been studied in this experiment, namely SVM, hybrid of Discrete Wavelet Transform + SVM and hybrid of Kalman Filter + SVM. Experiment results have been compared to find the most promising techniques among them.

40|$|Traditional {{metal filters}} are {{manufactured}} from perforated plate {{and one or}} more layers of woven wire mesh. The perforated plate forms the support portion of the <b>filter,</b> <b>and</b> delivers the overall strength of the filter to withstand operational pressures. The woven wire mesh forms the filter portion with the aperture size chosen to suit the required level of filtration. An ideal filter would have the maximum open area possible to minimise the filters’ resistance when in situ in the conduit. However maximising the open area decreases the overall strength of the <b>filter</b> <b>and</b> so open area must be compromised to deliver the required strength. The design freedoms and capabilities of Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology provides the opportunity to design novel filter media that are depth filters with x-, y- and z- planes with integrated <b>support</b> portion <b>and</b> <b>filter</b> portion. This filter mesh has a defined aperture size and by reducing the equivalent wire diameter, these novel filter media have a greater open area compared to the equivalent woven wire mesh. This potentially reduces the pressure drop across the <b>filter</b> <b>and</b> so reduces pumping energy requirements. In preliminary studies AM filter media have been designed using a repeating node unit to form the latticework of the AM filters. Previous test samples demonstrated that this AM integrated <b>filter</b> <b>support</b> <b>and</b> <b>filter</b> portion design decreased the pressure drop across the filter compared to conventional filter design. The aim is to develop the integrated <b>support</b> <b>and</b> <b>filter</b> AM design to incorporate different sizes of repeating nodes, with a larger node providing strength and the smaller node providing the filtration level. It has been possible to develop two node structures to deliver two latticeworks, one with a 1000 μm aperture {{and the other with}} 500 μm aperture. Filter disks comprising of 1, 2 and 3 layers of the individual nodes were tested for strength by collapse pressure. Conical <b>filters</b> were designed <b>and</b> tested for each individual node and for combination of nodes, i. e. layer of 500 μm and 1000 μm. These AM integrated <b>filter</b> <b>supports</b> <b>and</b> <b>filter</b> portion conical filters were tested for strength: collapse pressure and their pressure drop. The pressure drop across these novel AM integrated filters was largest for the AM 500 μm aperture <b>filter</b> alone <b>and</b> least in the AM 1000 μm filter. Combination of repeating nodes of both 1000 μm and 500 μm in one single filter delivered a decreased pressure drop across the filter compared to the AM 500 μm filter with 500 μm apertures alone. The integrated <b>filter</b> <b>support</b> <b>and</b> <b>filter</b> <b>support</b> portion AM design filters shown here have the potential to decrease the end users pumping energy requirements and so reduce energy costs and the end users carbon footprint...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the tuning process of flight {{simulator}} motion cueing <b>filters</b> <b>and</b> <b>support</b> the development of objective simulator motion cueing requirements, {{a better understanding of}} how multimodal pilot control behavior is affected by simulator motion fidelity is required. To this end, an experiment was performed where seven pilots performed a pitch target-following disturbance-rejection task in a simulator under four different motion cueing settings, in addition to performing the task in a real aircraft, which served as the baseline condition. Differences between the simulator and aircraft experiment setup were minimized. Small remaining differences in the display and the sidestick setup slightly affected the experiment dependent measures. However, the effects introduced by the motion cueing settings were far more apparent. When motion fidelity was increased to full aircraft motion, pilots were able to increase performance in attenuating the disturbance signal significantly. In addition, for increased motion fidelity, a change in multimodal pilot control behavior was observed by a decrease in pilot visual lead, while visual and vestibular perception delays increased.
