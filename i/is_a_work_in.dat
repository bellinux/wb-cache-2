500|$|Eve {{revolves}} around New York City fashion designer Shelly Williams (Eve), [...] "a woman whose fashion career {{is on the}} move [...] her love life <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> progress".

Hunter (Jason George), which is nearly derailed when he cries while they watch Casablanca on their first date. Both characters turn to two of their close friends for advice on the opposite sex, love, and relationships. Shelly frequently looks for advice from former model Rita Lefleur (Ali Landry) and married friend Janie Egins (Natalie Desselle-Reid), while J.T. finds support in his best friend Donovan Brink (Sean Maguire) and nightclub manager Nick Dalaney (Brian Hooks).|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{describes}} Revolver as [...] "the ultimate modern pop album". While {{noting the}} diverse musical directions adopted by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison {{in their respective}} contributions, he states: [...] "The biggest miracle of Revolver {{may be that the}} Beatles covered so much new stylistic ground and executed it perfectly on one record, or it may be that all of it holds together perfectly." [...] In his review for The Daily Telegraph, Neil McCormick says that the album shows the band at their most unified and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> which [...] "they introduce whole new vistas of sound yet still contain them within tightly structured and performed songs." [...] He also attributes an acerbic quality to the album that psychedelia lacked once the genre succumbed to [...] "the woolly politics of flower power". Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork views Revolver as a [...] "sonic landmark" [...] that, in its lyrics, [...] "matur pop from the stuff of teen dreams to a more serious pursuit that actively reflected and shaped the times in which its creators lived". He considers it to be McCartney's [...] "maturation record" [...] as a songwriter {{in the same way that}} Rubber Soul had been for Lennon.|$|E

Buildings that remained from the Meiji period were to be used.|$|E

2500|$|In summary, {{the issues}} are as follows. Navitaire contend that {{copyright}} subsists in the command set as a copyright work distinct from the source code. This claim {{has a number of}} aspects: (i) the collection of commands as a whole is entitled to copyright as a 'compilation'; (ii) each of the commands is a copyright work in its own right; (iii) alternatively, each of the 'complex' commands <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> its own right. As to the displays, Navitaire contend that (i) in respect of the VT100 screen displays, the 'template' (fixed data and layout of variable data) is a separate copyright work for each display and (ii) certain GUI screens on the separate Schedule Maintenance module are copyright works as they stand and have been copied. Then it is said (and this is a quite distinct allegation) that the similarity exhibited by eRes to OpenRes {{in the eye of the}} user is such that there has been 'non-textual copying' of the whole of the source code. This is said to be strictly analogous to taking the plot of a book: an author who takes the plot of another work and copies nothing else will still infringe copyright if a substantial part of the earlier author's work is represented by that plot, and the same goes for computer programs: John Richardson Computers v Flanders [...] FSR 497 (Ferris J).|$|E

60|$|The De Oratore <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> three divisions, {{addressed}} {{to his brother}} Quintus, {{in which it has}} undoubtedly been Cicero's object to convince the world that an orator's employment is the highest of all those given to a man to follow; and this he does by showing that, in all the matters which an orator is called upon to touch, there is nothing which he cannot adorn by the possession of some virtue or some knowledge. To us, in these days, he seems to put the cart before the horse, and to fail from the very beginning, by reason {{of the fact that the}} orator, in his eloquence, need never tell the truth. It is in the power of man so to praise--constancy, let us say--as to make it appear of all things the best. But he who sings the praise of it may be the most inconstant of mankind, and may know that he is deceiving his hearers as to his own opinions--at any rate, as to his own practice. The virtue should come first, and then the speech respecting it. Cicero seems to imply that, if the speech be there, the virtue may be assumed.|$|E

If Christendom after making a mighty effort to capture the holy sepulcher had not fallen away, the conquest which had been made with so vast an expenditure of blood {{would not have been}} lost. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> which no mere passing fervor will avail; bravery at first, endurance afterward, are needed. Many men must determine not only to assist to wrest the holy sepulcher from the hands of the infidels, but to give their lives, so long as they might last, to retaining it. It is scarce to be expected that men with wives and families will take a view like this, indeed it is not to be desired. But there are single men, men of no ties, who can devote their whole lives, as did the Knights of the Orders of the Cross, to this great object. When their life has come to an end doubtless others will take up the banner that their hands can no longer hold. But for life it is, indeed, that many of humble as well as of princely class must bind themselves to take and defend to death the holy sepulcher." ...|$|E
