25|$|Determining {{exactly what}} <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> made {{exceedingly}} difficult due to extensive destruction of documents amounting to official censorship {{that began in}} the eighteenth century by church officials and even archivists. There was a general shunning of the period that lasted well into the twentieth century, and almost no pertinent documents remain in either in the major Moravian archives in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania or Herrnhut, Germany.|$|E

25|$|The United States of America (U.S.) {{acknowledged}} the immense success of Apollo 11 {{with a national}} day of celebration on Monday, July 21, 1969.

25|$|The larger pipe was glass so the {{behaviour}} of {{the layer}} of the dyed stream could be observed, {{and at the end}} of this pipe there was a flow control valve used to vary the water velocity inside the tube.

When the velocity was increased, the layer broke up at a given point and diffused throughout the fluid's cross-section. The point at which this <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> the transition point from laminar to turbulent flow.|$|E

25|$|Streets of Fire {{began in}} the {{euphoria}} of knowing that Paramount really liked 48 {{and wanted to be}} in business with us if they could. What <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> that after we screened that cut for Paramount, Larry looked at Walter and said, “Paramount is pregnant; let’s get something and set it up right away.” Walter knew what he meant—that we were in a great position here—so he said, “We can do this two ways: present an idea now and get a deal done, or write a script on spec and get a lot more money.” Walter proudly considers himself a capitalist, so he suggested we do the latter.|$|E
25|$|Super Bowl XXXIV was an American {{football}} {{game between the}} National Football Conference (NFC) champion St. Louis Rams (now the Los Angeles Rams) and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Tennessee Titans to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1999 season. The Rams defeated the Titans by the score of 23–16, capturing their first Super Bowl win and first NFL championship since 1951. The game, played on January 30, 2000 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, was the fourth Super Bowl to be held {{a week after the}} conference championship games (the previous time this <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> Super Bowl XXVIII, and coincidentally that game was also played on January 30 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta).|$|E
25|$|He'd {{had some}} success, {{but then he}} {{had a series of}} setbacks. And there was also the scandal around The Warriors; any success had been eclipsed by the killings in the theaters. So there was that, as well as the noncommercial success of Southern Comfort and Long Riders and {{the fact that there was}} a writer's strike. All of that meant that Walter hadn't worked in a while. Meaning a year or so. And what <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> the strike ended and the studios didn't have a lot of ready scripts. So this clever colleague, Larry Gordon, dusted off a script that had been {{shuttling}} around development and got it greenlit at Paramount with his friend Michael Eisner. And that script was 48 Hrs..|$|E

25|$|Suddenly, Bernadotte heard firing in {{his rear}} at Mohrungen. He {{immediately}} called off the battle and retraced his {{steps toward the}} town. What had <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> that Russian cavalry reached the town from the east. Golitsyn, leading the cavalry of the left wing, reached the village of Alt Reichau (Boguchwały), east of Mohrungen. Though he could not hear the battle because of an acoustical quirk, he wanted to scout the territory to the west. From Alt Reichau, he sent three squadrons of cavalry under Count Peter Dolgorukov, followed by six more squadrons under General Pahlen, through the gap between Lake Narie (Narien) and Lake Marąg (Mahrung). The Russian horsemen entered Mohrungen as night fell, capturing the few defenders and pillaging the baggage trains that they found in the town.|$|E
25|$|Zeno, {{as member}} of the protectores domestici, did not {{take part in the}} {{disastrous}} expedition against the Vandals, led in 468 by Leo's brother-in-law Basiliscus. The following year, during which he held the honour of the consulate, he was appointed magister militum per Thracias and led an expedition in Thrace. The sources do not clearly state what enemy he fought there, and historians had proposed either Goths or Huns, or the rebels of Anagastes. Either way, before leaving, Leo and Zeno asked for Daniel the Stylite's opinion about the campaign, and Daniel answered that Zeno would have been the target of a conspiracy but would have escaped unharmed. What <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> that Leo sent some of his personal soldiers with Zeno to protect him, but they were bribed by Aspar to actually capture him. Zeno was informed of their intention and fled to Serdica, and because of this episode, Leo grew even more suspicious of Aspar.|$|E
25|$|The {{commissioner}} has {{the ability}} to forfeit picks the team is allotted in a draft. For example, in the 2007 NFL season, the New England Patriots were penalized for videotaping the Jets' defensive signals outside of a designated area. As a result, the Patriots forfeited their first-round pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. Similarly, the San Francisco 49ers were forced to forfeit a fifth-round pick in the same draft for tampering with a player under contract to the Chicago Bears, and were also forced to swap third-round selections with the Bears (moving the 49ers down and the Bears up six spots). Also, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell penalized the New Orleans Saints by taking away their 2nd round picks in the 2012 and 2013 NFL drafts {{in the wake of the}} New Orleans Saints bounty scandal. Another time this has <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> in the 2016 NFL Draft where the Patriots 1st round pick was taken away for Deflategate and redistribution rules should be made.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the rallies {{converging}} on Ayala Avenue {{was characterized by}} the exhaustion of the peculiar crony capitalism that evolved under Marcos' long reign. Following the assassination of Ninoy Aquino nearly a century later in 1983, the downtown area, where the rallies often <b>happened,</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the many}} places of rallies and mass demonstrations that were the basis of the People Power Revolution against the dictatorship of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos in 1986. It was that decade that witnessed the emergence of a so-called moderate opposition, with the Makati Business Club, against Marcos' ailing authoritarian regime. Established in 1980, the MBC, a union of executives from business entities operating in the district, was then a voice of opposition to the dictatorship, {{and it was one of}} the leading organizers of what was then dubbed the Confetti Revolution, so-named due to the yellow confetti from torn phone directories thrown along Ayala Avenue from the buildings in the wide road, whenever the rallies would happen.|$|E
25|$|Music scholar Martha Hume wrote:When you shake all the {{stardust}} {{off this}} tale, {{what you must}} begin with is an uneducated child {{from one of the}} most isolated cultures in the United States who was given in marriage to a man some six years her senior, a man who was a violent and sometimes brutal alcoholic, who was similarly uneducated and without any job skills to speak of. Add to that a migration to the state of Washington, where the child had no friends or relations; the arrival of four babies; regular—and reportedly mutual—domestic violence; and an income so unstable that there were times when the family had nothing to eat but dandelion greens, and you have a situation that might well have led to murder. But what actually <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> so improbable, so unimaginable, that the lives of Loretta and Mooney Lynn became one of the great legends of the twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|Martínez {{claimed the}} Interim WBC light middleweight {{championship}} on 4 October 2008, beating Alex Bunema via an eighth round retirement. On 14 February 2009 Martínez fought to a majority draw against Puerto Rican Kermit Cintron. The fight was controversial {{for a number}} of reasons; during the seventh round Martínez knocked Cintron down with a clean left hand shot and the referee reached the count of ten and waved the fight off. However, this was disputed by Cintron, who claimed that the knockdown was a result of a headbutt but actually the headbutt which Cintron claimed to have <b>happened</b> <b>was</b> actually an extremely powerful and accurate cross from Sergio Martínez. Cintron's protestations led to the referee overturning his decision and the fight continued. The fight went the twelve round distance and the scorecards revealed a draw, many ringside observers felt that the decision was a robbery and that Martínez easily outboxed Cintron and should have gained the victory.|$|E
