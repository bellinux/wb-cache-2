However, the exact compositions and functions of the tumor stroma are still largely unknown. Here, using a Lewis lung carcinoma implantation mouse model, we examined the hematopoietic compartments in tumor stroma and tumor-bearing mice. Different lineages of differentiated <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells</b> existed in tumor stroma with the percentage of myeloid cells increasing and the percentage of lymphoid and erythroid cells decreasing over time. Using bone marrow reconstitution analysis, we showed that the tumor stroma also contained functional <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells.</b> All <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells</b> in the tumor stroma originated from bone marrow. In the bone marrow and peripheral blood of tumor-bearing mice, myeloid populations increased and lymphoid and erythroid populations decreased and numbers of <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells</b> markedly increased with time. To investigate the function of <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells</b> in tumor stroma, we co-implanted various types of <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells</b> with cancer cells.

Furthermore, the growth of the primary implanted Lewis lung carcinomas and their metastasis were significantly decreased in mice reconstituted with IGF type I receptor-deficient <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells,</b> indicating that IGF signaling in the hematopoietic tumor stroma supports tumor outgrowth.

40|$|Background: Fibrodysplasia {{ossificans}} progressiva {{is a rare}} {{genetic disorder}} of ectopic skeletogenesis associated with dysregulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. <b>Hematopoietic</b> <b>cells</b> have been implicated in the ectopic skeletogenesis of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, and their replacement has been postulated as a pos-sible cure. However, the definitive contribution of <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells</b> to the pathogenesis of ectopic skeletogenesis remains obscure. Methods: We employed both careful clinical observation and in vivo murine transplantation studies to more precisely determine the contribution of <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells</b> to ectopic skeletogenesis. We identified a patient with fibrodyspla-sia ossificans progressiva who had undergone bone marrow transplantation {{for the treatment of}} intercurrent aplastic anemia twenty-five years earlier and investigated whether the clinical course of the fibrodysplasia ossificans progres-siva had been influenced by bone marrow replacement or immunosuppression, or both.

40|$|Background: Human {{bone marrow}} and {{umbilical}} cord blood are sources of allogeneic <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells</b> for transplantation, {{which is a}} life-saving treatment {{in a variety of}} diseases but is burdened by delayed T-cell reconstitution. Observational studies evaluating T-cell reconstitution in post-transplant recipients suggest that cord blood <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells</b> have a more effective capacity for T-cell reconstitution. This study focuses on the comparison of the capacity of cord blood and bone marrow <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells</b> to generate T cells in vitro. Design and Methods: <b>Hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells</b> were cultured in OP 9 -delta-like- 1 and OP 9 -green fluorescent protein co-cultures to estimate T and myeloid generation capacity, respectively. Phenotypic markers of T-lineage or myeloid differentiation were measured by flow cytometry and used to analyze their kinetics as a function of culture time. <b>Hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells</b> were labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinamidyl ester and analyzed after culture to track their phenotypic progression in consecutive generations. Mixed OP 9 -delta-like- 1 co-cultures were done with either carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinamidyl ester-labeled bone marrow and unlabeled cord blood <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells,</b> or vice versa, to evaluate their mutual influence on T-lineage differentiation. The T-cell potential of <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells</b> was addressed quantitatively by limiting dilution analysis. Results: Bulk cultures showed faster and more extensive T-cell differentiation by cord blood <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells.</b> Furthermore, the T-lymphoid differentiation capacity of cord blood and bone marrow <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells</b> can be discriminated very early based on the coordinated expression of CD 34 and CD 7. Mixing experiments with cord blood <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells</b> and bone marrow <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells</b> showed that these differences are cell intrinsic.

40|$|A major {{impediment}} to the {{effective use of}} adenovirus vectors for gene therapy {{is a lack of}} knowledge of how these vectors interact with diverse cell types in vivo. Adenovirus attachment to most human cell types is mediated by the fiber protein, which binds to an as yet unidentified cell receptor. In contrast to this, we report that adenovirus type 2 (Ad 2) attachment to <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells</b> is facilitated by interaction of the penton base protein with members of the beta 2 integrin family. Adenovirus particles were capable of binding to human monocytic cells, which lack fiber receptors, and virus binding could be blocked by a soluble penton base or by a function-blocking monoclonal antibody to integrin alphaMbeta 2. To confirm the role of alphaMbeta 2 integrins in Ad 2 binding to <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells,</b> we analyzed virus attachment and gene delivery to CHO cells expressing recombinant beta 2 integrins. alphaMbeta 2 -expressing CHO cells supported 3 - to 5 -fold-higher levels of Ad 2 binding and 5 - to 10 -fold-larger amounts of gene delivery than did nontransfected CHO cells, indicating that alphaMbeta 2 facilitates adenovirus attachment to and infection of <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells.</b> While beta 2 integrins promote Ad 2 attachment to <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells,</b> further studies demonstrated that alphav integrins were required for the next step in infection, virus internalization into cell endosomes.
