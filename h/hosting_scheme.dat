5000|$|Nucleic acid {{structures}} {{can be made}} {{to incorporate}} molecules other than nucleic acids, sometimes called heteroelements, including proteins, metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, and fullerenes. This allows the construction of materials and devices with a range of functionalities much greater than is possible with nucleic acids alone. The goal is to use the self-assembly of the nucleic acid structures to template the assembly of the nanoparticles hosted on them, controlling their position and in some cases orientation.Many of these schemes use a covalent attachment scheme, using oligonucleotides with amide or thiol functional groups as a chemical handle to bind the heteroelements. This covalent binding scheme has been used to arrange gold nanoparticles on a DX-based array,and to arrange streptavidin protein molecules into specific patterns on a DX array.A non-covalent <b>hosting</b> <b>scheme</b> using Dervan polyamides on a DX array was used to arrange streptavidin proteins in a specific pattern on a DX array.

30|$|Most {{of these}} works had the {{following}} common features: (1) the use of two-phase VN mapping, (2) the general Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) requirements, and (3) the mapping of VN request {{one at a time}} (i.e., online). Our proposal differs as follows: (1) for each accepted media cloud request, we calculate the optimal one-shot networking and <b>hosting</b> <b>scheme</b> with respect to QoS requirements (latency, bandwidth, computing, and mapping location). This guarantees a better use of MEC-DCs resources and an increased number of accepted VN requests, (2) media cloud requests are served by batch (see “Small-batch MEC mapping” section) which allows us to calculate a better mapping solution over time.|$|E

30|$|Processing, {{transmitting}} {{and storing}} media data in MEC-DCs {{can enhance the}} QoE of an end user in terms of latency, acceptance ratio, reliability and cost. The use of MEC-DCs compared to traditional DCs for media requests has known limitations: limited resource availability at a given DC, and a high resource requirement. To efficiently manage both the network and the MEC-DCs resources, we proposed a CG-based one-shot model. For each accepted request, an optimal one-shot networking and <b>hosting</b> <b>scheme</b> is calculated to ensure QoS requirements. We also analyzed the key factors that impact the network among MEC-DC locations: wavelength grooming, wavelength bandwidth capacity, the number of wavelengths per optical link, the number of MSPP transponders {{and the impact of}} network topology (UPSR vs. BLSR). Simulation results proved that the L-CG-MEC approach performed significantly better compared to the benchmark approaches from the literature.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Nowadays, more andmore {{enterprises}} and organizations are hosting their data into the cloud, {{in order to}} reduce the IT maintenance cost and enhance the data reliability. However, facing the numerous cloud vendors as well as their heterogenous pricing policies, customersmaywell be perplexed with which cloud(s) are suitable for storing their data and what hosting strategy is cheaper. The general status quo is that customers usually put their data into a single cloud (which is subject to the vendor lock-in risk) and then simply trust to luck. Based on comprehensive analysis of various state-of-the-art cloud vendors, this paper proposes a novel data <b>hosting</b> <b>scheme</b> (named CHARM) which integrates two key functions desired. The first is selecting several suitable clouds and an appropriate redundancy strategy to store data with minimizedmonetary cost and guaranteed availability. The second is triggering a transition process to re-distribute data according to the variations of data access pattern and pricing of clouds. We evaluate the performance of CHARMusing both trace-driven simulations and prototype experiments. The results show that compared with the major existing schemes, CHARMnot only saves around 20 percent of monetary cost but also exhibits sound adaptability to data and price adjustments.

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is {{a current}} prominent technology, which has contributed numerous {{development in the}} field of computing. Inaddition to all the benefits of cloud computing, it initiates the efficient monitoring of data service outsourcing. The main activity the users can perform in cloud is storing, sharing and retrieving data. Cloud act like a centralized storage system where all information are well kept and anyone can access it. So there arises a need to encrypt the data before realizing it to the public cloud. To search a data in cloud is a tedious task and to minimize the difficulty level of searching, currently Boolean search technique is adopted. But it has got so many drawbacks as it is more time consuming and produces irrelevant results. To overcome this difficulty a new model is proposed which ensures more security foruser’s data. A ranked keyword based searching over encrypted data is put forward. In this scheme users are allowed to search over encrypteddata. Whenever users take information from cloud it is produced in a ranked order. This method of ranked searching facilitates the usability of system in a great manner by finding the exact matching copy of the file in an arranged order considering important elements like keyword frequency. A privacy enabled data <b>hosting</b> <b>scheme</b> is deployed {{in the field of}} cloud computing. The facility to download and view the searched data is enabled which enhance server side ranking with no loss of data. The inefficiency of secured searching is solved in this proposed system.

The constructor take as arguments an action, list of categories, URI and MIME type of the data. All the names (such as actions, categories, <b>schemes,</b> <b>hosts</b> and MIME types) are represented using the type atom defined in the library Atom, edited from [5].

40|$|The {{deployment}} of Share Data Spaces in open, possibly hostile, environments arises {{the need of}} protecting the confidentiality of the data space content. Existing approaches focus on access control mechanisms that protect the data space from untrusted agents.

Encryption schemes {{can be used to}} protect the data space content from malicious <b>hosts.</b> However, these <b>schemes</b> do not allow searching on encrypted data. In this paper we present a novel encryption scheme that allows tuple matching on completely encrypted tuples. Since the data space does not need to decrypt tuples to perform the search, tuple confidentiality can be guaranteed even when the data space is deployed on malicious hosts (or an adversary gains access to the <b>host).</b> Our <b>scheme</b> does not require authorised agents to share keys for inserting and retrieving tuples.
