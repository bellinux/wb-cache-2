5|$|According to Packer, {{another common}} theme in Gordimer's novels is the choices {{ordinary}} {{people who live}} in oppressive regimes are forced to make. Literary critics Turgeon and Carli Coetzee explain that when she realises that whites are not always welcome in the anti-apartheid liberation movements, Rosa repudiates her father's struggle and leaves the country. Marsh-Lockett says that part of Rosa's struggle is forging her own identity, and this decision to rebel against her dead father is a bold step, although she does return later to South Africa to become a committed activist and ultimately a political prisoner. But, according to Coetzee, what Rosa achieves is what her father never could: to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> her own while still remaining politically committed.|$|E
5|$|Rarely {{will you}} find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or {{predictable}} three-chord blues progressions; {{and never will}} you find them spending much time on the usual pop album of romance, partying, or self-hype. Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging... Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often seems to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> its own... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance.|$|E
5|$|The system {{inverters}} typically provide {{power output}} at voltages {{of the order}} of 480 VAC. Electricity grids operate at much higher voltages {{of the order of}} tens or hundreds of thousands of volts, so transformers are incorporated to deliver the required output to the grid. Due to the long lead time, the Long Island Solar Farm chose to keep a spare transformer onsite, as transformer failure would have kept the solar farm offline for a long period. Transformers typically <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> 25 to 75 years, and normally do not require replacement during the life of a photovoltaic power station.|$|E

Fontaine convinces Nog that the bar is in trouble and he needs some help with the accounts; the Ferengi uses his business knowledge to help the hologram. Fontaine befriends Nog and after a while tries to convince him to return to the outside world following prompting by Ezri. Nog refuses to leave, resulting in Fontaine shutting down his program and refusing to let it restart. Fontaine appears to Nog in an otherwise empty holosuite, and Nog confesses that his injury has made him fear death and the ongoing war with the Dominion. Fontaine counsels Nog, who feels strong enough to leave the holosuite and return to duty. Shortly after he resumes his role back on the station, Nog returns to Fontaine to inform him that he has convinced Quark to leave the program running continuously to allow Vic to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> his own.|$|E

Their presence attracted crowds and Papps shouted [...] "let's have a scream from those who want Bobby and Frank to marry". The crowds went [...] "berserk" [...] and voiced their approval– which gave the go ahead for their on-screen marriage plans. The storyline played out on-screen when Frank decides that he should ask Bobby to marry him, despite still feeling hurt by Roo's actions. He picks Bobby up from school wearing a tuxedo in a Rolls-Royce and takes her to a picnic in the woods. He sets up a meal of fish and chips. Frank proposes and says; [...] "I can't offer you a Rolls-Royce lifestyle but you can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> fish and chips with me." [...] Frank also writes a song titled [...] "When Best Friends Fall in Love" [...] and this was played during the scenes.

500|$|... "Ali's Smile" [...] by William Burroughs is a {{short story}} {{originally}} published by Unicorn in 1971 and later republished in Burroughs's collection of short stories, Exterminator! (1973). At {{the opening of the}} story, Clinch Smith, a former colonial official, is living in an English town overshadowed by a giant slag heap. He is upset when he receives a letter from a Scientologist friend saying that he will [...] "disconnect" [...] from Smith, describing him as a [...] "suppressive person". A kris hanging on the wall of his room reminds Smith of Ali, whom he had met 30 years ago in Malaya. Ali had been put under a latah spell by an old woman, forcing him to dance in the marketplace. Smith rescued Ali, making the young man his houseboy. Ali returned to the market, however, and ran amok, killing several of the women with the kris. Smith was forced to shoot Ali, and kept the kris as a souvenir. Back in the present, Smith feels compelled to take the kris from the wall and goes to town, where there is a fight going on between hippies and locals, with members of Scientology's Sea Org in the crowd as well. Smith goes on a killing spree with the kris, which seems to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> its own. He stabs Lord Westfield, a Home Office official who has asked a private investigator to infiltrate a Scientology organization, a woman, and several Sea Org members, and then a bystander shoots him dead. Police and more combatants prepare to join the fight. As they do so, the slag heap collapses and buries everyone. At the end, the [...] "ghost face" [...] of Ali smiles over all.|$|E

2500|$|In this {{particular}} sonnet, the couplet {{acts as a}} summary of the basic sentiment of silent and stifled desire that fill the lines of the poem. [...] "So true a fool is love that in your will, though you do anything, he thinks no ill," [...] not only reiterates the dark romanticism that characterizes the entire sonnet, but Shakespeare also subtly establishes a connection between sonnet 57 and the succeeding 58th sonnet. Helen Vendler states, [...] "The slave of [...] reappears, rhyming for his couplet hell and well instead of their cousins will and ill of 57. The hell/well rhyme will return in the couplet of 129, and the will/ill of 57 has already been introduced into the sequence by sonnets 12 and 22. The complex will/ill/hell/well shared by sonnets 57/58 seems to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> its own, as its components add to themselves other conceptually related words". Literary editor Stephen Booth analyses the sonnet and claims, [...] "This whole poem may be described as a sustained play on 'to wait' meaning 'to serve', 'to wait on' and 'to wait' meaning 'to tarry in expectation', 'to await'". Booth also remarks upon the rhymes present throughout the sonnet and states, [...] "Note the incidental rhyme-like relationship of the very different functions performed by 'Nor think', 'think of nought' and 'thinks no ill'." [...] He also identifies the fact that Shakespeare, [...] "rhymes 'adieu' with 'you' a dozen times; {{there is no evidence that}} he ever gave 'adieu' its French pronunciation". Upon further analysis Booth also cites an undertone of forbidden love (reminiscent of Petrarch's signature poetry) and discusses the many double meanings present throughout the sonnet.|$|E
