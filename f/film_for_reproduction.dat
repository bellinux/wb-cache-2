5000|$|The next <b>film</b> {{scheduled}} <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> was Mickey's Man Friday (1935), but it {{was never}} completed. The original concept for Mickey's Revival Party was shelved and Orphan's Benefit became the only Disney film to be recreated scene for scene. It is unknown what led to the cancellation, although animation historian David Gerstein speculated that World War II or the Disney animators' strike of 1941 may have played a role, or that Walt Disney simply preferred to work on all-new films rather than [...] "extensively revisit the past." ...|$|R
50|$|The digital {{intermediate}} process uses digital {{tools to}} color grade, {{which allows for}} much finer control of individual colors and areas of the image, and allows for the adjustment of image structure (grain, sharpness, etc.). The intermediate <b>for</b> <b>film</b> <b>reproduction</b> can then be produced {{by means of a}} film recorder. The physical intermediate film that {{is a result of the}} recording process is sometimes also called a digital intermediate, and is usually recorded to internegative (IN) stock, which is inherently finer-grain than camera negative (OCN).|$|R
25|$|The <b>film</b> {{is notable}} <b>for</b> <b>reproductions</b> of 1910-era aircraft, {{including}} a triplane, monoplanes, biplanes and also Horatio Phillips's 20-winged multiplane from 1904. Wheeler insisted on authentic materials but allowed {{the use of}} modern engines and modifications necessary to ensure safety. Of 20 types built in 1964 at £5,000 each, six could fly, flown by six stunt pilots and maintained by 14 mechanics. The race take-off scene where seven aircraft are {{in the air at}} once included a composite addition of one aircraft. Flying conditions were monitored carefully, with aerial scenes filmed before 10am or in early evening when the air was least turbulent, for the replicas, true to the originals, were flimsy, and control, especially in the lateral plane, tended to be marginal. When weather conditions were poor, interiors or other incidental sequences were shot instead. Wheeler eventually served not only as the technical adviser but also as the aerial supervisor throughout the production, and, later wrote a comprehensive background account of the film and the replicas that were constructed to portray period aircraft.|$|R

50|$|One {{well known}} group of {{substances}} which are toxic <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> are teratogens - substances which cause birth defects - of which (S)-thalidomide is {{possibly the most}} notorious. Another group of substances which has received much attention (and some controversy) as possibly toxic <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> are the so-called endocrine disruptors. However, many substances which are toxic <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> do not fall into either of these groups: lead compounds, for example, {{are considered to be}} toxic <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> given their adverse effects on the normal intellectual and psychomotor development of human babies and children.|$|R

Type 8430 Duplicating Film is also used for the same purpose but for different contrasts. Their {{problem was that the}} developer and Type 8430 were not compatible and did not have a sufficiently high density or a long enough straight line. The results of this experiment have yielded a monobath formulation which when used with type 8430 film will give the desired density and straight line required...|$|R
