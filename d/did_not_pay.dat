5|$|By this time, the fortifications {{had fallen}} into {{disrepair}} because the Swedish command <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> much attention to these territories, and funds that were allotted for renovation were insignificant. In addition, the forts at Nöteborg and Nyenskans were considered sufficient to provide defense for the region. In 1702, however, some repairs were completed {{under the supervision of}} Captain L. Stobecks.|$|E
5|$|On February 19, 1904, a Baltimore and Ohio train accidentally {{crossed the}} Big Four Bridge, due to {{engineer}} Dick Foreman falling asleep and going {{the wrong way}} at Otisco, Indiana. The fireman kept shoveling coal and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> attention. It was the conductor that finally noticed the error midway across the Big Four Bridge. The wayward train had to back {{up all the way}} back to Otisco.|$|E
5|$|The Ring named Baldomir's {{victory over}} Judah the upset {{of the year}} for 2006. Judah's IBF and WBA belts were not on the line, because Baldomir <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> sanctioning fees to the IBF and WBA. Baldomir did win the lineal, WBC and The Ring titles, while the WBA (Super) title was vacated after Judah's loss (WBA (Regular) titleholder Luis Collazo became the sole WBA Champion), but the IBF still {{recognized}} him as their champion.|$|E

50|$|Interest is {{generally}} paid by offshore banks without tax being deducted. This {{is an advantage}} to individuals who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> tax on worldwide income, or who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> tax until the tax return is agreed, or who {{feel that they can}} illegally evade tax by hiding the interest incomes.|$|R

5|$|Baseball had {{for some}} time been living uneasily in the {{knowledge}} that bribes were being offered by gamblers, and that some players were accepting them. The players knew it was going on, and the owners knew it was going on. But more important, the players knew that the owners knew—and they knew the owners were doing nothing about it for fear of a scandal that might damage organized baseball. Under such conditions it quite obviously <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> to be honest.|$|E
5|$|During the 1952 Winter Olympics, Rødkleiva {{hosted the}} men's slalom and the women's slalom, {{with the other}} events taking place at Norefjell. The {{organizing}} committee had set up 15,000 tickets for the men's discipline on 19 February, but between 25,000 and 30,000 people attended the race, the surplus who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> for tickets. The large popularity was to see Norway's favoured Stein Eriksen. Although leading after the first heat, {{he came out of}} balance in the second and finished second behind Austria's Othmar Schneider. The women's race held the following day was won by the American Andrea Mead-Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|In Switzerland, Constantine I and {{his family}} found {{themselves}} isolated and without an income. The Greek government under Venizelos <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> pensions to former rulers and prohibited any contact between the exiles and King Alexander. Already in fragile health, the former king became gradually more depressed. The Russian Revolution and the National Schism deprived Olga of her immovable property and {{she was forced to}} live a much less lavish lifestyle than in the past. She did, however, enjoy spending more time with her sons and grandchildren, from whom she had been long separated by the war.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1990s, the old shop house {{buildings}} were torn down, resulting in street peddlers displaying their wares on canvas sheets along the empty {{roads in the}} area. The peddlers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> rent, but the Singapore government forbade them from selling brand-new items. To {{keep up with the}} times, some of the peddlers put up their wares to sell on websites and eBay, especially those hard to sell items such as old photographs, badges, medals and other collector's items. The market remained until its final closure by the authorities on 10 July 2017.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} wedding, Truman and Jacobson opened a {{haberdashery}} together at 104 West 12th Street in downtown Kansas City. After brief initial success, the store went bankrupt {{during the recession}} of 1921. Truman <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> off {{the last of the}} debts from that venture until 1934, when he did so {{with the aid of a}} political supporter. Jacobson and Truman remained close friends, and Jacobson's advice to Truman on Zionism later played a role in the U.S. government's decision to recognize Israel.|$|E
5|$|St. Laurent {{tried to}} project an {{image as a}} family man, and to that end often {{addressed}} schoolchildren. As he had in previous elections, he spoke to small groups of children regarding Canadian history or civics. The strategy backfired while addressing children in Port Hope, Ontario. With the children inattentive, some playing tag or sticking cameras in his face, St. Laurent angrily told them that it was their loss if they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> attention, as {{the country would be}} theirs to worry about far longer than it would be his.|$|E

5|$|The film {{features}} heavy product placement, with American Airlines, Chrysler, Hertz, Travelpro, and Hilton Hotels all featured prominently. Competing brands {{are displayed}} as blurs in scene backgrounds or are replaced with pseudonyms in dialogue. However, the brands <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> for the exposure; rather, they waived the {{fees for the}} producers to shoot on location, such as at AA's airport areas and inside Hilton hotels. Reitman expressed his desire to use actual brands as he finds them less distracting.|$|E
5|$|Winston Groom {{was paid}} $350,000 for the {{screenplay}} rights to his novel Forrest Gump and was contracted for a 3percent {{share of the}} film's net profits. However, Paramount and the film's producers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> him, using Hollywood accounting to posit that the blockbuster film lost money. Tom Hanks, by contrast, contracted for a {{percent share of the}} film's gross receipts instead of a salary, and he and director Zemeckis each received $40million. Additionally, Groom was not mentioned once in any of the film's six Oscar-winner speeches.|$|E
5|$|As {{attorney}} general, Crittenden issued {{only one}} notable opinion. The plaintiff {{in the case}} was an individual whose property had been damaged during Andrew Jackson's invasion of {{what would become the}} Florida Territory in 1818. The case was still being adjudicated in 1841. A Florida court found in favor of the plaintiff and ordered the federal government to compensate him for the damages and to pay him interest on his claim from the time the damages were incurred. Treasury Secretary Thomas Ewing asked Crittenden whether the court had the authority to award interest and whether or not it should be paid. Crittenden opined that it did not, and Ewing <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> the interest. Crittenden's opinion was used as a precedent in similar cases by future attorneys general.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{having left}} TNA in June 2007, Konnan did not wrestle for AAA until October, and only {{wrestled}} in four matches during {{the remainder of}} the year, due to his aforementioned surgeries. Konnan returned to World Wrestling Council at WWC Euphoria Tour 2008 on January 6, 2008, with Ron Killings of the 3LiveKru, losing a tag team match against Eddy and Orlando Colon. In March 2008, Konnan sued TNA for racism and discrimination, alleging that while the company said that they would help pay for his hip replacement surgery, they did not. Konnan also claimed that TNA helped pay for Scott Steiner's operation, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> for Ron Killings's surgery from around the same time.|$|E
5|$|During {{development}}, Square Enix <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> Grin {{over several}} months, and disapproved of the game's Nordic art style. Grin worked {{to bring the}} game's art style closer to the Final Fantasy series, but {{after six months of}} development was told that no funding would ever come from Square Enix, and the developer filed for bankruptcy several days later. Word of the project leaked out through art portfolios of those who worked on the project and even a tech demo surfaced. In 2011, Fortress was thought to have been in development by an undisclosed studio, but this was also suspended and the game will not be released in any form.|$|E
5|$|From 1963 to 1965, MRD was not {{directly}} involved in Formula One, and often ran works cars in other formulae. A separate company, Jack Brabham's Brabham Racing Organisation, ran the Formula One works entry. Like other customers, BRO bought its cars from MRD, initially at £3,000 per car, although it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> for development parts. Tauranac was unhappy with his distance from the Formula One operation and before the 1966 season suggested {{that he was no}} longer interested in producing cars for Formula One under this arrangement. Brabham investigated other chassis suppliers for BRO, however the two reached an agreement and from 1966 MRD was much more closely involved in this category. After Jack Brabham sold his shares in MRD to Ron Tauranac at the end of 1969, the works Formula One team was MRD.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the Spanish missionary Fray Alonso de León {{reported}} that about eighty families in San Mateo Ixtatán <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> {{tribute to the}} Spanish Crown or attend the Roman Catholic mass. He described the inhabitants as quarrelsome and complained that they had built a pagan shrine in the hills among the ruins of pre-Columbian temples, where they burnt incense and offerings and sacrificed turkeys. He reported that every March they built bonfires around wooden crosses about two leagues from the town and set them on fire. Fray de León informed the colonial authorities that the practices of the natives were such that they were Christian in name only. Eventually, Fray de León was chased out of San Mateo Ixtatán by the locals.|$|E
5|$|Natasha Falle {{grew up in}} {{a middle-class}} home in Nova Scotia; a suburb of Toronto, Ontario; and a suburb of Calgary, Alberta. Her mother managed stores in the wedding {{industry}} and her father was a police officer with a vice squad, arresting drug dealers and pimps. While she was growing up, Falle had multiple family members with addictions. When she was a young teenager, Falle's parents divorced, and she subsequently lived in a single-parent home with her mother. They moved into an apartment in downtown Toronto. Falle's father <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> her mother alimony and there was often no money for food, so Falle began stealing food to survive.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{a project}} of real estate {{developer}} and former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds, the structure was built by Walter Chrysler, {{the head of the}} Chrysler Corporation. The Chrysler Building's construction was characterized by a competition with 40 Wall Street and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. The building served as the corporation's headquarters from 1930 until the mid-1950s. Although the building was built and designed specifically for the car manufacturer, the corporation <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> for its construction and never owned it, as Walter P. Chrysler decided to pay for it himself, so that his children could inherit it.|$|E
50|$|The {{divergence}} between the marginal private interest and the marginal social interest produces two primary results. First, as already noted, the party receiving the social benefit <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> for it, {{and the one}} creating the social harm <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>pay</b> for it. Second, when the marginal social cost exceeds the private marginal benefit, the cost-creator over-produces the product. Ultimately, because non-pecuniary externalities overestimate the social value, they are over-produced.|$|R
