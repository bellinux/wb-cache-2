40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if exercise testing could expose a latent electrical substrate of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) in asymptomatic <b>gene</b> <b>carriers.</b> BackgroundManagement of asymptomatic ARVC <b>gene</b> <b>carriers</b> is challenging because of variable penetrance of disease and the recognition that sudden cardiac death may be the first clinical manifestation. MethodsExercise-induced abnormalities during exercise treadmill testing (ETT) were initially compared in 60 subjects: 30  asymptomatic ARVC <b>gene</b> <b>carriers</b> and 30 healthy controls. In phase 2 of the study, ETT results of 25 patients with ARVC with histories of sustained ventricular arrhythmia or cardiac arrest were evaluated to determine if ETT abnormalities in asymptomatic <b>gene</b> <b>carriers</b> were common to patients with a malignant electrical form of the disease. ResultsDepolarization abnormalities during ETT were found to develop more frequently in asymptomatic <b>gene</b> <b>carriers</b> compared with healthy controls: epsilon waves appeared in 4 of 28 (14 %) compared with 0 of 30 (0 %) (p = 0. 048), premature ventricular contractions in 17 of 30 (57 %) compared with 3 of 30 (10 %) (p = 0. 0003), and new QRS terminal activation duration ≥ 55 ms in 7 of 22 (32 %) compared with 2 of 29 (7 %) (p = 0. 03). Superior axis premature ventricular contractions occurred only in <b>gene</b> <b>carriers.</b> In the second phase of the study, the frequency of these abnormalities was found to be high in patients with symptomatic ARVC: new epsilon waves appeared in 3  of  18  (17 %), superior axis premature ventricular contractions in 21 of 25 (84 %), and new terminal activation duration ≥ 55 ms in 8 of 12 (67 %). ConclusionsExercise testing exposes a latent electrical substrate in asymptomatic ARVC <b>gene</b> <b>carriers</b> that is shared by patients with ARVC with histories of ventricular arrhythmia.

The small amount of xylitol integrated into XGC (3. 9 % w/w) contributed 50 % of the osmotic pressure of XGC, and enhaned the osmolysis of endosome cooperatively with the proton sponge effect, thus improving endosomal escape.

BackgroundProgressive cardiac conduction defect is a frequent disease commonly attributed to degeneration and fibrosis of the His bundle and its branches. In a French family, we have identified a splicing mutation in the SCN 5 Agene leading to hereditary progressive cardiac conduction defect. MethodsWe have extended the size of the pedigree and phenotyped and genotyped all family members, and also investigated in vitro the functional consequences of the mutation. ResultsAmong 65 potentially affected members, 25 individuals were carriers of the IVS. 22 + 2 T→C SCN 5 Amutation. In relation to aging, <b>gene</b> <b>carriers</b> exhibit various types of conduction defects. P-wave, PR, and QRS duration increased progressively with age in <b>gene</b> <b>carriers</b> and in noncarriers. Whatever the age, conduction parameters were longer in <b>gene</b> <b>carriers.</b> The widening in the QRS complex with aging was more pronounced in <b>gene</b> <b>carriers</b> older than 40 years. Functional studies show that the IVS. 22 + 2 T→C SCN 5 Amutation lead to exon 22 skipping and to a complete loss of function of the affected allele, but to a normal trafficking of the mutated gene product.

Basal and pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin were assayed using an immunoradiometric method (sensitivity less than 2 pg/ml). Calci-tonin measurement was evaluated on the basis of histopathological findings in surgical thyroid specimens. Results: We found C-cell hyperplasia or medullary thyroid carcinoma in all the 71 <b>gene</b> <b>carriers</b> – even for the youngest patients – and nodal metastases were present in four cases. Calcitonin measurement (basal or pentagastrin-stimulated) detected C-cell disease preoperatively in all patients. Six of the 71 patients were not surgically cured: one had nodal metastases, one had an advanced staged disease and four had an incomplete nodal dissection or had not undergone lymph node surgery...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA major {{challenge}} in synthetic gene delivery is to quantitatively predict the optimal design of polymer-based <b>gene</b> <b>carriers</b> (polyplexes). Here, we report a consistent, integrated, and fundamentally grounded computational methodology {{to address this}} challenge. This is achieved by accurately representing the spatio-temporal dynamics of intracellular structures and by describing the interactions between <b>gene</b> <b>carriers</b> and cellular components at a discrete, nanoscale level. This enables the applications of systems tools such as optimization and sensitivity analysis {{to search for the}} best combination of systems parameters. We validate the approach using DNA delivery by polyethylenimine as an example. We show that the cell topology (e. g., size, circularity, and dimensionality) strongly influences the spatiotemporal distribution of <b>gene</b> <b>carriers,</b> and consequently, their optimal intracellular pathways. The model shows that there exists an upper limit on polyplexes’ intracellular delivery efficiency due to their inability to protect DNA until nuclear entry. The model predicts that even for optimally designed polyethylenimine vectors, only ∼ 1 % of total DNA is delivered to the nucleus. Based on comparison with gene delivery by viruses, the model suggests possible strategies to significantly improve transfection efficiencies of synthetic gene vectors...|$|R
