5|$|This species {{appears to}} have been confounded with C.distans; and from Lightfoot's {{description}} of the green angles of the fruit, I presume it to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>what</b> he intended under that name. It is considerably larger than the real distans, the spikes black intermixed with green rather than yellowish, and the female ones often branched or compounded at their base. Its most essential and decisive character however consists in the two strong deep-green nerves or ribs which run along each side of the fruit externally near the edge. The arillus is also broader and more compressed than in C.distans.|$|E
5|$|The successors and {{offspring}} of Ramesses III constructed tombs that had straight axes. They all had similar decorations. Notable amongst these is KV2, {{the tomb of}} Ramesses IV, which has been open since antiquity, containing {{a large amount of}} hieratic graffiti. The tomb is mostly intact and is decorated with scenes from several religious texts. The joint tomb of Ramesses V and Ramesses VI, KV9 (also known as the Tomb of Memnon or La Tombe de la Métempsychose) is decorated with many sunk-relief carvings, depicting illustrated scenes from religious texts. Open since antiquity, it contains over a thousand examples of graffiti written in ancient Greek, Latin and Coptic. The spoil from the excavation and later clearance of this tomb, together with later construction of workers huts, covered the earlier burial of KV62 and seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>what</b> protected that tomb from earlier discovery and looting.|$|E

By recognising Brian's authority over Leth Moga, that is, the Southern Half, which included the Provinces of Munster and Leinster (and the Hiberno-Norse cities within them), Máel Sechnaill was simply accepting the reality that confronted him and retained control over Leth Cuinn, that is, the Northern Half, which consisted of the Provinces of Meath, Connacht, and Ulster.|$|E

25|$|Cicero’s {{case was}} divided into three parts. The first part {{detailed}} exactly the charge brought by Ericius. Cicero explained how a rustic son of a farmer, who lives off the pleasures of his own land, would not have gained anything from committing patricide because he would have eventually inherited his father's land anyway. The second part concerned the boldness and greed {{of two of the}} accusers, Magnus and Capito. Cicero told the jury that they were the more likely perpetrators of murder because the two were greedy, both for conspiring together against a fellow kinsman and, in particular, Magnus, for his boldness and for being unashamed to appear in court to support the false charges. The third part explained that Chrysogonus had immense political power, and the accusation was successfully made due to that power. Even though Chrysogonus may not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>what</b> Cicero said he was, through rhetoric Cicero successfully made him appear to be a foreign freed man who prospered by devious means {{in the aftermath of the}} civil war. Cicero surmised that it showed what kind of a person he was and that something like murder was not beneath him.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary plans {{showed an}} {{intention}} {{to create a}} square fortification with four angular, [...] "arrow-head" [...] bastions with protective orillons, with living quarters arranged around a square courtyard for the garrison in the centre. It was intended to develop the Italianate ideas first introduced in Portsmouth and Yarmouth under Henry, and would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>what</b> the historian Andrew Saunders considers to be [...] "the most advanced piece of military engineering for its date {{to be seen in}} this country". In 1554, two light artillery guns called sakers were reported installed in the fort. During the reign of Mary I, an unsuccessful attempt was made to create a garrison of 150 men on the island in 1554, partially to provide manpower to complete the project, and in 1591 proposals were again put forward to complete the work.|$|E

500|$|Virginia's {{condition}} might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>what</b> {{prompted the}} Poe family to move, {{in the hopes}} of finding a healthier environment for her. They moved several times within Philadelphia in the early 1840s and their last home in that city is now preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site in Spring Garden. In this home, Virginia was well enough to tend the flower garden and entertain visitors by playing the harp or the piano and singing. The family then moved to New York sometime in early April 1844, traveling by train and steamboat. Virginia waited on board the ship while her husband secured space at a boarding house on Greenwich Street. By early 1846, family friend Elizabeth Oakes Smith said that Virginia admitted, [...] "I know I shall die soon; I know I can't get well; but I want to be as happy as possible, and make Edgar happy." [...] She promised her husband that after her death she would be his guardian angel.|$|E
500|$|In Nappalli, the {{appellant}} {{was dismissed}} from an educational institution for {{his refusal to}} participate in the aforementioned acts. Central to his claim was the submission that these acts were religious practices that went against his belief as a Jehovah's Witness and thus infringed his constitutional right to practice and profess his religion guaranteed by Article 15. However, the Court held that since [...] "religion" [...] in Singapore under the Constitution is restricted to [...] "a citizen's faith in a personal God" [...] and does not include [...] "a system of belief in one's own country", the acts in question were not religious practices. Hence, the appellant's rights had not been contravened. The Court took the view that [...] "the appellant's interpretation of the pledge and anthem ceremony as a religious ceremony was a distortion of secular fact into religious belief". If the appellant's interpretation was correct, this would result in Article 15(1) losing operative effect, for [...] "ow can the same Constitution guarantee religious freedom if, by asking citizens to pledge their allegiance to country, it is (as the appellant suggests) coercing participation in a religious ceremony? This excruciatingly absurd interpretation cannot <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>what</b> was envisaged by the authors of the Constitution." ...|$|E
500|$|James the Fat led {{the men of}} Lennox and Argyll in open {{rebellion}} against the crown and this may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>what</b> the king needed to bring a charge of treason against the Albany Stewarts. Murdoch, his sons Walter and Alexander and Duncan, Earl of Lennox were in Stirling Castle for their trial on 18 May at a specially convened parliament. An assize of seven earls and fourteen lesser nobles were appointed {{to hear the evidence}} that linked the prisoners to the rebellion in the Lennox. [...] The four men were condemned, Walter on 24 May and the others on 25 May and immediately beheaded in 'front of the castle'. James demonstrated a ruthless and avaricious side to his nature in the destruction of his close family, the Albany Stewarts, that yielded the three forfeited earldoms of Fife, Menteith and Lennox. An enquiry set up by James in 1424 into the dispersal of crown estates since the reign of Robert I exposed legal defects in a number of transactions where the earldoms of Mar, March and Strathearn together with the Black Douglas lordships of Selkirk and Wigtown were found to be problematic. [...] Strathearn and March were forfeited in 1427 and 1435 respectively. Mar was forfeited in 1435 on the earl's death without heir which also meant that the lordships of Garioch and Badenoch reverted to the crown. James sought to boost his income further through taxation and succeeded in getting parliament to pass legislation in 1424 for a tax to go towards paying off the ransom—£26,000 was raised but James sent only £12,000 to England. By 1429, James stopped the ransom payments completely and used the remainder of the taxation on buying cannons and luxury goods from Flanders. Following a fire in the castle of Linlithgow in 1425, funds were also diverted to the building of Linlithgow Palace which continued until James's death in 1437 and absorbed an estimated one tenth of royal income.|$|E

When Barth first met her in 1924 he had already been married for 12 years and, in 1929, she moved into the Barth family household, which included his wife Nelly and five children. George Hunsinger summarizes the influence of von Kirschbaum on Barth's work: [...] "As his unique student, critic, researcher, adviser, collaborator, companion, assistant, spokesperson, and confidante, Charlotte von Kirschbaum was indispensable to him.

2500|$|The {{developers}} who followed Hitchcock's lead in Woodside were less flamboyant though similarly successful. [...] In 1863 John Mecke bought farmland from a family, the Moores, {{who had lived}} {{for more than a}} century and a half on what would become the northern part of what would become Woodside. He intended to subdivide, but became insolvent and, in 1867, died. [...] His heirs sold the property to two carpenters, Henry G. Schmidt and Emil Cuntz, who, in 1871, deeded their property to an organization known as the Bricklayers' Cooperative Building Association. [...] This organization seems not to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>what</b> its name suggests since it was a New York corporation headed by Charles Merweg who gave his occupation as [...] "speculator in real estate." [...] In any event, the Association erected a housing development in north Woodside which it called Charlotteville. [...] The name was later given the more common spelling of Charlottesville. In 1886 another speculator, Effingham H. Nichols, divided property in the eastern part of the village and called it Woodside Heights. Other 19th-century developers included Charles F. Ehrhardt who sold lots in the northern part of the village and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company which converted two properties on the west side into salable lots.|$|E
2500|$|John Stuart Mill {{was also}} an early proponent of feminism. In his article The Subjection of Women (1861, {{published}} 1869), Mill attempted {{to prove that the}} legal subjugation of women is wrong and that it should give way to perfect equality. He believed that both sexes should have equal rights under the law and that [...] "until conditions of equality exist, no one can possibly assess the natural differences between women and men, distorted as they <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> <b>What</b> is natural to the two sexes can only be found out by allowing both to develop and use their faculties freely." [...] Mill frequently spoke of this imbalance and wondered if women were able to feel the same [...] "genuine unselfishness" [...] that men did in providing for their families. This unselfishness Mill advocated is the one [...] "that motivates people {{to take into account the}} good of society as well as the good of the individual person or small family unit. Similar to Mary Wollstonecraft, Mill compared sexual inequality to slavery, arguing that their husbands are often just as abusive as masters, and that a human being controls nearly every aspect of life for another human being. In his book The Subjection of Women, Mill argues that three major parts of women’s lives are hindering them: society and gender construction, education, and marriage.|$|E
