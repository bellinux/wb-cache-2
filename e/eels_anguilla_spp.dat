50|$|Anguillicoloides crassus is a {{parasitic}} nematode worm {{that lives}} in the swimbladders of <b>eels</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> <b>spp.)</b> and appears to spread easily among eel populations after introduction to a body of water. It {{is considered to be}} one of the threats to the sustainability of populations of European eel (Anguilla anguilla). It was introduced to the European continent in the 1980s, where it was reported independently from Germany and Italy in 1982, having probably been introduced from Taiwan. It is thought to have reached England in 1987 from continental Europe. It is a natural parasite of the Japanese eel in its native range.|$|E
50|$|The American eel (Anguilla rostrata) is a facultative {{catadromous}} fish {{found on}} the eastern coast of North America. <b>Eels</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> <b>spp.)</b> are fish belonging to the elopomorph superorder, a group of phylogenetically ancient teleosts. The American eel has a slender snakelike body that {{is covered with a}} mucous layer, which makes the eel appear to be naked and slimy despite the presence of minute scales. A long dorsal fin runs {{from the middle of the}} back and is continuous with a similar ventral fin. Pelvic fins are absent, and relatively small pectoral fin can be found near the midline, followed by the head and gill-covers. Variations exist in coloration, from olive green, brown shading to greenish-yellow and light gray or white on the belly. Eels from clear water are often lighter than those from dark, tannic acid streams.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Typhoid fever {{has become}} one global health problem. Typhoid fever {{is caused by a}} Gram-negative bacterium, Salmonella typhi. <b>Eel</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> <b>spp.)</b> is a fish which lives in the sea or in freshwater. Several {{previous}} studies have found that <b>Anguilla</b> <b>spp.</b> mucus has the ability as antibacterial against Gram-positive and negative. Although the antibacterial activity of Anguilla spp. against various pathogens had been reported, very little is known about its activity against Salmonella typhi. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate antibacterial activity of <b>Anguilla</b> <b>spp.</b> mucus against Salmonella typhi bacteria. METHODS: Present study was an experimental in vitro test. Antibacterial activity assays were carried out by the disc diffusion method. Antibacterial activity was determined by the clear zone formed around the paper disc and minimum inhibitory concentration was determined by observing the lowest concentration which could inhibit the growth of Salmonella typhi. RESULTS: Result of the present study showed that the <b>Anguilla</b> <b>spp.</b> mucus has inhibitory effects against Salmonella typhi. Minimum inhibitory concentration from the <b>Anguilla</b> <b>spp.</b> mucus was 12. 5 %.

40|$|International audienceAbstract : The {{introduced}} parasite Anguillicoloides crassus {{is thought}} {{to play an important}} role in the decline of freshwater <b>eel</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> <b>spp.)</b> populations. These nematodes are known to negatively affect many fitness-related traits in eels. We used experimental infections to study the effect of A. crassus on the relative size or mass of organs, and the expression of functionally relevant genes (total of 12 parameters) that are involved in the silvering process of Anguilla anguilla. Our results showed that the liver mass, the hemoglobin α-chain, and androgen receptors α expression levels were significantly higher in infected eels, whereas the freshwater rod opsin expression level and the gut mass were significantly lower in infected eels. Our results suggested that infected eels were at a more advanced stage in the silvering process than uninfected counterparts of similar size. These results may be explained by 2 hypotheses. First, A. crassus could trigger physiological mechanisms involved in the silvering process as a side-effect of infection. Second, eels may adjust their life history traits in response to infection. The implications for eel migration and reproductive success may be either negative or positive, depending on whether the response to A. crassus infection results in an additional cost of the parasite or is due to the phenotypic plasticity of the host...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: For {{diadromous}} anguilliform fish, such as <b>eel</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> <b>spp.)</b> and lamprey (Petromyzon spp. and Lampetra spp.), conventional fishways function poorly. Often this is {{a reflection}} of their alternate life history strategies and/or poor swimming performance in comparison to subcaragiform species, for which fishways are more frequently designed. Unique behavioural strategies adopted by anguilliform fish during upstream migration (such as climbing) provide an opportunity for the development of novel, species specific solutions. For eel, synthetic bristle board passes have been developed and widely implemented. More recently, boss or studded substrates (commonly referred to as eel or lamprey tiles in the UK) have been installed oriented either horizontally (with upward facing studs) or vertically (and side mounted with studs facing the channel wall) at numerous low-head barriers. Despite implementation in the field, here we will present results from the first controlled study on the efficiency of eel/lamprey tiles. Using a large open channel flume we were able to quantify passage success, passage efficiency and observe the behaviour of yellow phase European <b>eel</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> anguilla) and upstream migrant adult river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) as they encountered a model crump weir. The weir was either unmodified or modified with horizontally or vertically oriented tiles. The addition of the tiles improved passage; however efficiencies remained low in some instances, particularly for lamprey. Potential causes for poor passage are discussed, as is the need for further research on design optimisation, which if conducted may enable eel/lamprey tiles to significantly improve the connectivity of rivers fragmented by anthropogenic barriers...|$|R
50|$|Anguillicoloides novaezelandiae is a {{parasitic}} nematode worm {{that lives}} in the swimbladders of <b>eels</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> <b>spp.),</b> particularly Anguilla australiensis, Anguilla anguilla and Anguilla dieffenbachii. Specimens have been located in Italy (where it {{is thought to have}} been introduced) and New Zealand (where it is a native species). The species is most similar to A. Australiensis. However,it differs from the latter species {{in the shape of the}} head end which is bulbously inflated, almost spherical, and followed by a marked neck constriction in A. Australiensis, whereas it is only slightly expanded in A. novaezelandiae. Also, the anterior ovary in A. australiensis females extends anteriorly to about the mid-length of the oesophagus, while it does not reach the end of the oesophagus in A. novaezelandiae. Both species differ in size and form. While the body of A. australiensis is long (30 mm to 40 mm in males and 60 mm to 70 mm in gravid females) and relatively slender (at most 1.5 mm in gravid females), that of A. novaezelandiae is much shorter (between 6 and 15 mm in males and between 10 and 31 mm in gravid females) and wider (up to 3 mm in gravid females). The shape of the posterior end of the female body is different in these two species.|$|E

40|$|For the {{distribution}} of the European <b>eel</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> anguilla), only Schmidt (1909) has conducted substantial investigations, yielding a qualitative description (Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Europe and Northern Africa). In this article, a meta-analysis of reported fishing yields is presented, showing a major concentration of glass eel yield in the Bay of Biscay (and possibly farther south) and of yellow and (or) silver eel yield in the western Mediterranean. Fisheries target the glass eel stage at highest stock density and shift to the silver eel stage at low density. Because there is no suitable habitat in the Sahara, the southern limit is, contrary to Schmidt's belief, primarily determined by continental conditions. From the centre of {{the distribution}} to the north, a long and slow decline in density occurs.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} {{with which}} estuarine habitats produce fish is poorly understood {{due to the}} complexity of life cycles. Spatial dynamics of estuarine fishes comprise retentive and dispersive behaviors which occur on seasonal and ontogenetic scales. Salinity is an important scalar in the spatial dynamics of estuarine fishes, that may affect production and dispersal. In this paper, we review investigations that used otolith strontium (Sr) to chart estuarine movements of fishes. Based upon microprobe analysis of otolith Sr, variable patterns of estuarine ingress have been shown for bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli, freshwater <b>eel</b> <b>Anguilla</b> <b>spp.,</b> Japanese sea bass Lateolabrax japonicus, and Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulatus. In anadromous fishes, striped bass Morone saxatilis American shad Alosa sapidissima, and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus, otolith Sr has been used to record emigration of juveniles and adults from freshwater and oligohaline nurseries. These same species showed seasonal cycles in otolith Sr consistent with expectations on frequency of spawning migration. A critical yet seldom evaluated issue is the relative roles of salinity, temperature, ontogenetic stage, and physiological state on otolith Sr. In {{a review of the literature}} (1982 – 1997), we found that these effects were infrequently evaluated (10 of 27 species investigated). Rarer still were studies of the interaction of these effects on otolith Sr. Only a single study had calibrated a laboratory-based salinity vs. otolith Sr relationship using field data. Based upon values obtained through the literature review, we observed a positive relationship between otolith Sr and habitat salinities among freshwater, estuarine, and marine taxa. # 2000 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Control of {{reproductive}} function in captivity {{is essential for}} the sustainability, of commercial aquaculture production, and in many fishes it can be achieved by manipulating photoperiod, water temperature or spawning substrate. The fish reproductive cycle is separated in the growth (gametogenesis) and maturation phase (oocyte maturation and spermiation), both controlled by the reproductive hormones of the brain, pituitary and gonad. Although the growth phase {{of reproductive}} development is concluded in captivity in most fishes-the major exemption being the freshwater <b>eel</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> <b>spp.),</b> oocyte maturation (OM) and ovulation in females, and spermiation in males may require exogenous hormonal therapies. in some fishes, these hormonal manipulations are used only as a management tool to enhance the efficiency of egg production and facilitate hatchery operations, but in others exogenous hormones are the only way to produce fertilized eggs reliably. Hormonal manipulations of reproductive function in cultured fishes have focused on the use of either exogenous luteinizing hormone (LH) preparations that act directly {{at the level of the}} gonad, or synthetic agonists of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRHa) that act at the level of the pituitary to induce release of the endogenous LH stores, which, in turn act at the level of the gonad to induce steroidogenesis and the process of OM and spermiation. After hormonal induction of maturation, broodstock should spawn spontaneously in their rearing enclosures, however, the natural breeding behavior followed by spontaneous spawning may be lost in aquaculture conditions. Therefore, for many species it is also necessary to employ artificial gamete collection and fertilization. Finally, a common question in regards to hormonal therapies is their effect on gamete quality, compared to naturally maturing or spawning broodfish. The main factors that may have significant consequences on gamete quality-mainly on eggs-and should be considered when choosing a spawning induction procedure include (a) the developmental stage of the gonads at the time the hormonal therapy is applied, (b) the type of hormonal therapy, (c) the possible stress induced by the manipulation necessary for the hormone administration and (d) in the case of artificial insemination, the latency period between hormonal stimulation and stripping for in vitro fertilization.

40|$|Dams are obstructing rivers worldwide, {{impairing}} {{habitat and}} migration opportunities for many freshwater fish species; however, global data linking dam and fish distributions have been limited. Here, we quantify dam obstruction at the biogeographic scale of freshwater ecoregion, which provides the spatial framework necessary {{to assess the}} risk of fish species loss due to dams and allows us to identify both ecoregions and genera at risk. Nearly 50 % of the 397 assessed freshwater ecoregions are obstructed by large- and medium-size dams, and approximately 27 % face additional downstream obstruction. A synthesis of obstruction data and fish traits indicates that taxa such as lampreys (Lampetra spp.), <b>eels</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> <b>spp.),</b> and shads (Alosa spp.) are at particular risk of species loss.

40|$|Freshwater <b>eels</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> <b>spp.)</b> {{intrigued}} scientists for centuries. Their {{life cycle}} involves for example two distinct larval stages {{and a long}} distance migration, which may cover thousands of kilometers. The farming of eels is still dependent on the influx of wild glass eels, because eels do not mature naturally in captivity due to strong neural inhibition. Since the 1980 s, the glass eel influx of several eel species drastically declined. The European eel (A. anguilla) was recently enlisted by the IUCN as a critically endangered species; therefore there is an urgent call for eel management and artificial reproduction. Artificial reproduction may contribute to restoration of the eel population by releasing the current fishing pressures on the wild stocks, and allowing a sustainable eel aquaculture in the future. Although, artificial reproduction by applying hormone treatments is possible to some extent, success ra tes are still far from creating a sustainable aquaculture. This thesis focuses on the spawning migration, maturation and reproduction of eels. New tools are developed that may improve current artificial maturation and reproduction protocols for eel aquaculture. Promotor: H. P. Spaink, Co-Promotores: G. E. E. J. M. van den Thillart, R. P.

40|$|Downstream {{passage through}} {{hydroelectric}} facilities {{is a significant}} area of concern regarding the protection of emigrating silver-phase <b>eels</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> <b>spp.)</b> because eels residing upstream of dams must emigrate to achieve their biotic potential and because their complex life history, relatively large size, and unique physiology may result in high vulnerability to injury or mortality during passage, in tum resulting in lost productivity on the species/population level Efforts {{to develop and implement}} upstream passage of juvenile American eels over {{the past decade or so}} presumably will result in significant increases in numbers of adult eels requiring downstream passage as they reach maturity. Hydroelectric projects are often hydraulically complex and they present multiple passage routes, including turbines, spill and/or deep water gates, and bypasses that pose different risks for downstream passage, as a result route selection can have significant impacts on reproductive potential. Understanding the combination of passage route selection and relative survival by passage route is necessary to evaluate the impacts of a particular project, and subsequently estimate cumulative impacts in a basin where multiple dams are present. The route of passage used by emigrating eels is dependent on physiology and behavior as well as physical processes and project operations. Biotelemetry techniques, such as PIT, radio telemetry, and acoustic tags are suited to examine the behavior of emigrating eels at hydroelectric projects and have been used at several sites. Results of biotelemetry and passage survival studies have been applied to develop short-term and permanent downstream protection measures and can assist in the design of hydro-mechanical passage measures.

40|$|<b>Eels</b> <b>Anguilla</b> <b>spp.</b> are fishes {{belonging}} to the Superorder Elopomorph, a group of phylogenetically ancient teleosts (Nelson 1994). Eels have ancestrally evolved a continental growth phase and thus migrate between marine breeding and continental feeding areas. In continental waters, eels colonize an extremely wide variety of salt (SW), brackish and freshwater (FW) habitats. Such ubiquity is almost unique among teleost fishes. However, the mechanisms controlling eel continental dispersal, i. e., distribution in different growth habitats, remain largely unknown. Dispersal is here understood in ecological terms and is thus referred to as movements leading to habitat colonization in general. Dispersal is a pivotal process for both species persistence and evolution, and involves a great diversity of ecological phenomena (Clobert et al. 2001). In the eel, dispersal in different habitats may influence survival, growth, sex differentiation, age and size at silvering [female size affects fecundity, egg-size and larval viability (Einum et al. 2004) ], swimming ability during the spawning migration, and finally capacity to reproduce. In turn, decision-makings by individual dispersers for migration to, immigration in and emigration from different habitats depend on genetic, physiological, morphological and social attributes and are affected {{by a number of}} environmental parameters (Clobert et al. 2001). In this chapter, we provide material to understand how (proximate control) and why (ultimate control) dispersal patterns by eels in continental habitats are what they are. In the first section, we describe the process of continental dispersal, focusing on the behavioural changes that occur during ontogeny. We emphasize the importance of considering separately migration, which is mainly an endogenously-controlled behaviour expressed by glass eels and elvers, from ranging, which is mainly an environmentally-controlled behaviour expressed by yellow eels. Based on this dichotomy, we review {{in the second and third}} sections the internal and external (environmental) drivers of movements. In the fourth section, we investigate the evolutionary forces acting on eel movements and we propose an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) model explaining how decision-making for movement by individual dispersers may be ultimately controlled. We further use this ESS model for qualitative predictions on the evolution of diadromy (i. e., colonisation of freshwater habitats) in response to anthropogenic changes in selective pressures. Finally, in the conclusion, we point out lack of knowledge and suggest future research directions...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to improve}} {{our understanding of how}} dams and reservoirs impact freshwater systems worldwide. The following questions were addressed specifically: 1) what are the spatial patterns and magnitudes of flow regulation and channel fragmentation by dams globally; 2) how are dam impacts distributed biogeographically, and which are the biogeographic regions and taxa most threatened by dam impacts; and 3) how can climate change and dams be expected to interact in basins, and what management actions would mitigate adverse interactions? Results show {{that the majority of the}} world’s large river systems are fragmented and have their flow altered by dams. Exceptions to this tend to lie in regions inhospitable to hydropower development, such as northern tundra, or in the least economically active regions. The biogeographic distribution of dam impact is widespread, both at terrestrial and freshwater scales, representing significant threat to global biodiversity. Relatively species-poor tundra is the world’s only terrestrial ecoregion which remains predominantly unaffected by dams. Nearly half of the world’s freshwater ecoregions are internally fragmented by dams, and ecoregional distinctions may be artifically imposed by dams in many cases. Freshwater ecoregions with the highest counts of total and endemic species remain relatively unobstructed, representing significant conservation potential. Diadromy is one of the few fish traits indicative of vulnerability to dams for which data are sufficient for global scale analysis. Lampreys (Lampetra spp.), <b>Eels</b> (<b>Anguilla</b> <b>spp.)</b> and Shad (Alosa spp.) are examples of genera particularly vulnerable to dams because their distributions coincide with the most heavily fragmented freshwater ecoregions, and a large proportion of the coincident species for each genera are diadromous. Due to changes in discharge and water stress, the area of large river basins in need of management interventions to protect ecosystems or people will be much greater for basins impacted by dams than for basins with free-flowing rivers. Proactive measures that restore the natural capacity of rivers to buffer climate-change impacts are more desirable than reactive actions since they may also lead to environmental benefits such as higher water quality and restored fish populations – benefits which may later be unattainable...|$|E

The reasons for the declines are unclear but are probably due to reductions in spawning stocks (Jansen et al. 2007; Winter et al. 2007; Clevestam et al. 2011), overfishing (Tzeng et al. 1995; Moriarty and Dekker 1997; Jellyman et al. 2000; Hoyle and Jellyman 2002; Briand et al. 2003; Chisnall et al. 2003; Dekker 2003; Lin et al. 2010), growth habitat and access reductions (Busch et al. 1998; Haro et al. 2000; McCleave 2001; McCleave and Jellyman 2004; Verreault et al. 2004; Graynoth et al. 2008), pollution (Amiard-Triquet et al. 1988; Robinet and Feunteun 2002; Palstra et al. 2006; van Ginneken et al. 2009), swim bladder and gill parasites and viral infections (Haenen et al. 2002; Szekely et al. 2002; Kirk 2003; Sures and Knopf 2004; van Ginniken et al. 2005; Han et al. 2008, 2009 a; Sasal et al. 2008; Parker et al. 2011), global climate change (Castonguay et al. 1994; Kimura et al. 2001; Casselman 2002; Knights 2003; Han et al. 2006, 2009 b; Friedland et al. 2007; August and Hicks 2008; Bonhommeau et al. 2008; Miller et al. 2009), and the solar cycle (Tzeng et al. 2012). To understand the declines, it is necessary to study the early life history of anguillid eels. The life history of eels during the continental growth phase is well documented, but knowledge of the marine larval life stage from the spawning ground to the estuary is still fragmented (McCleave 1993; Cheng and Tzeng 1996; Wang and Tzeng 2000; Tzeng 2003; Edeline et al. 2009; Miller 2009). Early life history information is very important because it is a key factor in understanding possible reasons for recruitment success or failure of anguillid eels and also for their artificial propagation.|$|E

A single Camallanus sp. male was recovered {{from one of the}} mudsuckers; Capillaria spp. from three catfish and one squeaker; philometrid nematodes from two silver barbel, 15 squeakers and a largemouthed bream; Paracamallanus cyathopharynx from one tiger-fish, 80 catfish, 28 silver barbel and one squeaker; Procamallanus laeviconchus from a single catfish; Rhabdochona esseniae from six largescaled yellowfish; Rhabdochona versterae from 14 spot-tailed robbers; Rhabdochona spp. from 20 catfish, 17 silver barbel, eight squeakers, two eels, one large-mouthed bream and two red-breasted bream; Raillietnema synodontisi from 33 squeakers; Spinitectus petterae from 37 catfish; Spinitectus zambezensis from 55 squeakers; Spinitectus spp. from one tiger-fish and four silver barbel, and Spirocamallanus daleneae and Synodontisia thelastomoides from 33 and 35 squeakers, respectively. Second- and third-stage Contracaecum spp. larvae were recovered from 26 spot-tailed robbers, five tiger-fish, one large-scaled yellowfish, 53 catfish and ten silver barbel and unidentified nematode larvae from two spottailed robbers, 57 large-scaled yellowfish, both mudsuckers, 105 catfish, 45 silver barbel, 58 squeakers, all three the eels, 29 Mozambique bream, 33 red-breasted bream and 26 large-mouthed bream. Camallanus sp. in mudsuckers, Capillaria spp. in catfish and squeakers, Rhabdochona spp. in eels, catfish, silver barbel, squeakers, large-mouthed bream and red-breasted bream, Spinitectus spp. in tiger-fish and silver barbel, Paracamallanus cyathopharynx in silver barbel, tiger-fish and squeakers, Raillietnema synodontisi and Synodontisia thelastomoides in squeakers, constitute new parasite records for the respective hosts in South Africa. With few exceptions, the fishes harboured more nematode larvae than adult nematodes but no pattern of seasonal abundance of either of the developmental stages was evident for any of the fish species examined.

The total individual fecundity of fish from 560 to 1960 g BW was between 981 x 103 and 6320 x 103 eggs, respectively. The mean relative individual fecundity equalled 2415 x 103 (± 524 x 103) per kg BW. The values of this parameter ranged from 1753 x 103 to 3224. 5 x 103 kg – 1.
