5|$|A {{number of}} other mammals, {{including}} the cat-like fossa, are <b>endemic</b> to Madagascar. Over 300 species of birds have been recorded on the island, of which over 60percent (including four families and 42 genera) are <b>endemic.</b> The few families and genera of reptile that have reached Madagascar have diversified into more than 260 species, with over 90percent of these being <b>endemic</b> (including one <b>endemic</b> family). The island is home to two-thirds of the world's chameleon species, including the smallest known, and researchers have proposed that Madagascar may be the origin of all chameleons.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 262 species of bird have been {{recorded}} living in the wild {{on the island of}} Tasmania, nearby islands and islands in Bass Strait, 182 of which are regularly recorded, while another 79 are vagrants and one is extinct. Birds of Macquarie Island are not included in this list. Twelve species are unique (<b>endemic)</b> to the island of Tasmania, and most of these are common and widespread. However, the forty-spotted pardalote is rare and restricted, while the island's two breeding <b>endemic</b> species, the world's only migratory parrots, are both threatened. Several species of penguin are late summer visitors to Tasmanian shores. Tasmania's <b>endemic</b> birds have led to it being classified as an <b>Endemic</b> Bird Area (EBA), one of 218 such areas worldwide. Priority regions for habitat-based conservation of birds around the world, they are defined by containing two or more restricted-range (<b>endemic)</b> species.|$|E
5|$|Adult Psylliodes luridipennis beetles are {{invariably}} {{found on}} the Lundy cabbage (Coincya wrightii), a species <b>endemic</b> to the island of Lundy, where they feed on the leaves. They are not found on other locally occurring plants. However, researchers were also able to lure the beetles onto other crucifers taken from gardens. Two other taxa are known only from Lundy cabbages—the true weevil Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes and an undescribed race of the flea beetle Psylliodes napi—making the plant unique to Britain as the only <b>endemic</b> species which is the exclusive host to <b>endemic</b> insect species. However, the Lundy cabbage is also host to a diverse variety of other invertebrate species.|$|E

40|$|Majella National Park {{in central}} Italy {{is known to}} be an endemic-rich area, but {{distributions}} of its <b>endemics</b> have not been comprehensively studied. <b>Endemics</b> with 10 or more records and spatial uncertainties at 0. 8. Arctic-alpine elevation, edaphic barrens and low open-vegetation, individually or in pairs, were found to be predictive for <b>endemics.</b> Forty-eight <b>endemics,</b> 10 of which exclusive, were recorded and Maxent-predicted for the Majella massif. Subsets of 38 <b>endemics</b> were recorded on other mountains in proportion to their arctic-alpine area, thus conforming to the Island Theory. Maxent confirmed its strengths also at fine resolutions and, in addition, showed to be robust across predictor layers at both resolutions. A linear species-area relationship appeared superior to the Maxent model in predicting the number of <b>endemics</b> per arctic-alpine “island”.

50|$|Oman has a {{total of}} 191 range-restricted species, {{representing}} 13.6% of the total flora (Patzelt, 2014). This high proportion of range-restricted species (<b>endemics,</b> near <b>endemics</b> and regional <b>endemics)</b> in the Sultanate {{can be explained by}} a unique combination of ecological factors that restricted the range of species in the past. <b>Endemics</b> are found in all vegetation types throughout the country. However, some habitats are particularly rich in range-restricted species and are of special interest, encompassing sites of maximum biodiversity. Significant species-rich habitats include the monsoon-affected mountains in southern Oman, the northern Hajar mountains, and the coastal areas of the central desert; these areas represent local centres of plant endemism.|$|R

5|$|New Zealand's {{geographic}} isolation for 80 million years and island biogeography has influenced {{evolution of the}} country's species of animals, fungi and plants. Physical isolation has not caused biological isolation, and this {{has resulted in a}} dynamic evolutionary ecology with examples of very distinctive plants and animals as well as populations of widespread species. About 82% of New Zealand's indigenous vascular plants are <b>endemic,</b> covering 1,944 species across 65 genera and includes a single <b>endemic</b> family. The number of fungi recorded from New Zealand, including lichen-forming species, is not known, nor is the proportion of those fungi which are <b>endemic,</b> but one estimate suggests there are about 2,300 species of lichen-forming fungi in New Zealand and 40% of these are <b>endemic.</b> The two main types of forest are those dominated by broadleaf trees with emergent podocarps, or by southern beech in cooler climates. The remaining vegetation types consist of grasslands, the majority of which are tussock.|$|E
30|$|The results {{confirm the}} botanical {{importance}} of the Kamdebooberge, with its two strict <b>endemics</b> (Acmadenia sp. nov., Faurea sp. nov.), healthy populations of five other Sneeuberg <b>endemics</b> (Erica passerinoides, Euryops dentatus, Gazania caespitosa, Haworthia marumiana var. batesiana, Psoralea margaretiflora), and the unique composition of the fynbos communities found on the upper SE-facing slopes. Further botanical exploration in these mountains may well yield more undescribed species, additional populations of local <b>endemics,</b> and additions to the Sneeuberg flora.|$|R
40|$|Eighty-one {{species of}} Columbellidae are {{recorded}} from the New Caledonia region from depths {{in excess of}} 100 meters, with a majority occurring in the 200 - 600 m interval, and none recorded from deeper than 900 m. Eight are previously known, and 73 are described as new species. Most are small to very small, with 23 species (28 %) smaller than 5 mm, the smallest measuring 1. 9 mm.

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper (Bellwood & Meyer, Journal of Biogeography, 2009, 36, 569 – 576), we {{critically}} evaluated {{the utility of}} marine <b>endemics</b> for marking the geographical origins of species. In reply, Briggs (2009) identified two issues that needed clarification: (1) whether <b>endemics</b> are assumed to mark the geographical origins of species or areas of exceptionally high rates of origination, and (2) whether our evaluation {{of the role of}} <b>endemics</b> disproves the centre of origin hypothesis. Of these two issues, the first can be clearly resolved by recourse to the original literature that explicitly states that it has been assumed that <b>endemics</b> do indeed mark the probable sites of origin of species. The second is equally clear: our evidence does not and can not disprove the centre of origin theory. We suggest, however, that the current data, and <b>endemics</b> in particular, provide limited support for centre of origin theories and that they are more consistent with some centre of accumulation theories. The Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA; Coral Triangle) therefore appears to be an area where species persist, a centre of survival, regardless of the site of origin of species...|$|R
40|$|In southeastern D. R. Congo, about 550 metallophytes grow on soils {{with high}} copper and cobalt concentrations, 57 {{of which are}} <b>endemics</b> to these metalliferous environments. About 70 % of those <b>endemics</b> are {{considered}} threatened by destruction of habitats through mining activities. To provide guidelines for future restoration programs, the edaphic ecological niches of eight copper <b>endemics</b> were studied using a pragmatic sampling method adapted for urgent conservation needs. Niches were modelled using violin plot along Cu, Co and C:N gradients representing the two main independent edaphic gradients among nine edaphic variables (C, N, C:N, K, P, pH, Co, Cu, and Mn). Copper <b>endemics</b> presented distinct edaphic niches along the copper and cobalt gradients, but differentiation was lower along the C:N gradient. In addition, edaphic elements presented covariations among them and metalliferous soils had higher nutrient and element content compared to the non-metalliferous soils of the region dominated by the Miombo woodland. The complexity of the soil composition and the edaphic niches of copper <b>endemics</b> revealed an important challenge {{in the implementation of}} the species conservation and the habitat restoration strategies of post-mining sites.
