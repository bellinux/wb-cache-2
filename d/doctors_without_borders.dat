5|$|Cyclone Kesiny struck Madagascar {{during a}} period of {{political}} strife after the Malagasy presidential election in 2001. In the election, incumbent president Didier Ratsiraka lost to Marc Ravalomanana, but rejected the results; after the election, Ratsiraka declared the city of Toamasina as the new capital of the country. The political crisis caused difficulties after the storm in distributing food, and Ratsiraka's operational center in the city was damaged. During the storm, Toamasina experienced severe flooding, forcing hundreds of residents to evacuate their homes. Emergency volunteers provided water and food to the affected residents. Workers from the World Health Organization and Médecins Sans Frontières (<b>Doctors</b> <b>Without</b> <b>Borders)</b> provided medical assistance to residents in Toamasina during the storm. Damaged roads contributed to economic contraction, after trucks were unable to use roads and bridges in the eastern portion of the country. By October, the political crisis had ended, and the government repaired most of the damaged infrastructure. The cost of repairing the roads and bridges was about $2.5million (2002 USD), which was paid by a $50million credit from the World Bank Group. Due to poor harvest related to the storm in some areas, the World Food Programme provided 18,000tonnes of food to 394,250residents, beginning in November 2002 {{at the request of the}} Malagasy government. After the storm, the government of Norway donated kr1.2million (2002Norwegian krone, 172,000 USD) for storm relief, and the government of Switzerland provided about $33,000 (USD).|$|E

40|$|Communication campaigns {{by major}} {{organizations}} {{in the field of}} development have been heavily dependent on humanitarian photography to motivate and attract donors. This genre of photography serves its purpose by informing, surprising and attracting the attention of a broad audience. It captures real life and real problems people in need have to deal with in remote areas of the world. This paper delves into the use of visual semiotics in the context of humanitarian photography and for the purpose of fund-raising by case study research of recent communication campaigns as implemented by major players in the field such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Global Fund to Fights AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, <b>Doctors</b> <b>without</b> <b>Border,</b> CARE and Save the Children. The purpose is to identify key issues which allow for the elicitation of a sign framework specific to the fund-raising genre and its idiosyncratic use of visual signs in photography based on a broad theoretical basis of semiotics. The analysis focuses on the content and methods of signification of photography in each case study. The effectiveness of humanitarian photography and important aspects of its function is discussed in the scope of its use as a communication medium for development...|$|R
50|$|The Federation Health Program of 1994 was {{implemented}} {{as part of}} the reform process. This included a set of proposals by the Ministry of Health and created two new laws, the Law on Health Care and the Law on Health Insurance. The Law on Health Care focuses on the delivery of services and the family medicine model. The Law on Health Insurance insures each person receives a basic health care package regardless of income and resources available.A program launched by the National Research Council, called “Trauma and Reconciliation in Bosnia-Herzegovina”, focused on conducting research while including cross-cultural experience for American and Bosnian experts. The program organized meetings with professionals from a variety of organizations, including NGOs, children’s homes, and women’s organizations to gain a local perspective on what should be done to help address the rising health issues due to war caused trauma. They concluded that around 18%-38% of residents suffered from PTSD during or after the war.Other programs, such as those organized by <b>Doctor’s</b> <b>without</b> <b>Borders,</b> Harvard Trauma Program for Refugees, and the International Center for Psychosocial Trauma by the University of Missouri-Columbia were all launched with an aim to help provide further education for family doctors when it came to trauma and psychological issues. The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) also led a program, “Mental Health”, to help address the trauma issues that this vulnerable population might face. This program addresses the problem by providing financial support for other projects and reforms taking place, providing additional training for experts, and helping to address the stigma in the public associated with mental health issues.
