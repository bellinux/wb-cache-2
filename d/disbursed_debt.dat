Similar analyses have been done for Latin America, Europe, and the United States, but none {{in the context of}} low-income countries. Using public financial management indicators, as measured in two recent assessments related to the Heavily-Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, this study shows that improving public financial management leads to better fiscal outcomes, as measured by the overall fiscal balance and external debt levels, after controlling for other characteristics that might alter fiscal outcomes.

The {{staff of the}} IMF and IDA considers that Guyana’s performance {{with respect to the}} conditions for reaching the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative has been satisfactory. The authorities were able to establish a track record of satisfactory policy implementation under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) -supported program, evidenced by the completion of the first program review in early September and good progress toward meeting the conditions of the second review due in February 2004.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in {{the perspective of}} sizable historical debt relief and large positive net resource flows to HIPCs. It argues that, by substantially reducing HIPCs’ debt stocks and debt service payments, the Initiative provides a solid basis for debt sustainability and room for increased social spending. For poverty reduction, HIPC relief is important but broader international support is needed. The paper maintains that, as experience has shown, external support can be effective only if it reinforces sound policies implemented by HIPCs themselves. Thus, debt relief and official development assistance are critical as “help for self-help. ”Debt relief;HIPC Initiative;Poverty reduction;debt, debt service, debt reduction, external debt, creditors, debt service payments, debt sustainability, payments, debt stocks, debt management, creditor, bilateral debt, debt forgiveness, interest, traditional debt relief, bilateral creditors, debts, commercial creditors, debt burdens, stock-of-debt operation, commercial debt, loans, debt burden, debt stock, relief mechanisms, debtors, debt service ratio, external debt sustainability, multilateral creditors, debt reduction mechanisms, obligations, amount of debt, traditional debt relief mechanisms, debt problems, multilateral debt, long-term debt, debt relief initiatives, debt relief mechanisms, balance of payments, actual debt, debt ratios, debt servicing, debtor country, debt service reduction, debt rescheduling, external debt burdens, public expenditure, debt service obligations, stock of debt, debt swaps, debt outstanding, sovereign debt, restructuring, debt overhang, debtor reporting, private creditors, evolution of debt, external borrowing, external debt burden, debtor countries, long-term external debt, debt service payment, debt cancellation, repayment, long-term debt sustainability, foreign aid, bilateral donors, external resources, public external debt, donor governments, net present value of debt, official creditors, debt-service obligations, substantial debt, ratio of debt service to exports, debtor reporting system, debt data, debt management practices, borrowing policies, current account deficits, debt service to exports, external shocks, repayment capacity, solvency, principal repayments, foreclosure, multilateral debts, short-term debt, external shock, debt level, external debt-service obligations, repayments, ratio of debt, debt management strategy, international lending, bilateral agreements, access to debt, debt management policies, external resource, sovereign debtors, deficits, terms of debt, debt sustainability analysis, debt service relief, debt-relief, government guarantee, current account, <b>debt</b> <b>disbursed,</b> external <b>debt</b> management, substantial debt relief, public and publicly guaranteed, debt burden of low-income countries, government debt, traditional debt-relief mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} Indian {{capital flight}} at US $ 88 billion (in 1997 dollars) over the 1971 - 97 period, a sum that is roughly 20 % of the US $ 448 billion real external <b>debt</b> <b>disbursed</b> {{to the country}} over the same time period. There is also evidence of a strong year-to-year correlation between debt inflows and flight-capital outflows. The paper explores {{the nature of this}} association between capital flight and external debt in the Indian economy. An analysis by Boyce (1992, World Development, 20, pp. 335 - 349) for the Philippines revealed the presence of contemporaneous bi-directional causality, in other words, a financial revolving door relationship between external debt and capital flight in that economy. The research question addressed by this paper is whether such a financial revolving door relationship exists in India, given its higher level of external indebtedness and lower debt-to-GNP ratio as compared with the Philippines. Utilizing a simultaneous equation model to examine the association between capital flight and external debt in the Indian economy, the paper confirms the existence of a financial revolving door relationship between the two endogenous variables. ...|$|R

Burkina Faso’s {{performance}} under PRGF-supported programs during 1993 – 2002 and {{in implementing}} the policy agenda {{laid out in the}} Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper adopted in 2000 was satisfactory. Real GDP recovered strongly, and inflation remained low. The economic, financial, and social situation remains fragile and difficult. The IMF staff has supported the government structural reform strategy aimed at promoting good governance, economic diversification, competitiveness, and private sector development.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Completion Point Document for consideration of Rwanda’s Enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries. The government has maintained {{the policy of}} protecting social sector budget allocations from cuts {{during the course of}} the fiscal year, and military spending has progressively been reduced, which has also enabled a reallocation of resources to priority areas. Moreover, since the 2002 budget cycle, expenditures have been classified in all ministries according to programs and sub-programs, expected outputs, activities, and inputs.
