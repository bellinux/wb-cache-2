5|$|Flanagan {{observes that}} in Tenebrae, Argento offers two {{characters}} {{who suffer from}} impaired vision. Gianni (Christian Borromeo) is an eyewitness to an axe-murder, but the trauma of seeing the killing causes him to disregard a vital clue. Returning {{to the scene of}} the crime, he suddenly remembers everything, and is murdered before being able to tell anyone. Homicide detective Giermani reveals that he is a big fan of the novels of Agatha Christie, Mickey Spillane, Rex Stout, and Ed McBain, but admits that he has never been able to guess the identity of the killer in any of the books. He is similarly unable to solve the real mystery until the last corpses are piled at his feet – he cannot see Peter Neal for what <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E
5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they sat down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware that it really is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>is,</b> she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E

25|$|After rescuing Patricia {{from the}} {{clutches}} of Marius, Templar realises that his quest for anonymity is at an end (with both Marius and Teal now aware of who <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>is)</b> and begins to make plans {{to leave the country}} (along with his compatriots if they so choose). But first he must try to convince the inventor of the electroncloud to abandon the weapon; when the scientist indicates that he not only refuses to give up his work, but might also be mad, Templar reluctantly decides the man must die to potentially save the lives of millions.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2005, Speakeasy Comics put {{out their}} sequel, The Living and the Dead, written by Todd Livingston and Robert Tinnell, with art by Micah Farritor. In it, Victor, now calling himself Hans, must {{create a new}} body for his first cousin who wants her syphilitic son to remain alive after a vicious beating, and she coerces {{him to do so}} under fear of exposing him for who <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>is.</b> Half-crazed due to the disease, the newly born monster {{proceeds}} to start a Grand Guignol theater in Ingolstadt until Victor puts him down {{with the help of the}} first monster he ever created.

25|$|Ipomadon {{travels the}} world, {{fighting}} in tournaments, becomes King of Apulia following his father's death, and hears {{one day that}} the Proud is being besieged in her city by a knight called Lyoline. This ugly knight is threatening to take her away with him to India. Ipomadon {{makes his way to}} King Maleager's court once again, just in time to witness the arrival of the Proud's messenger, begging for some assistance for her lady. But curiously, Ipomadon has chosen to arrive at King Maleager's court {{in such a way that}} he is not recognised, not even by the queen. He pretends to be a fool, and the reader (or listener) is treated to a comic scene in which the fool Ipomadon is first ridiculed and then accepted by the knights and noblemen, little knowing who <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>is.</b> Cabanus is conveniently absent from court on this occasion. The maiden who has been sent as a messenger by the Proud is mightily unimpressed that a fool should wish to take on the challenge, but since nobody else in the court seems at all inclined to offer their services, the king allows Ipomadon the fool to take it up.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>really</b> <b>was</b> {{a little}} mad on the subject; no more so, of course, {{than any other}} man with a fixed idea, but {{certainly}} no less.|$|R

25|$|There, {{they meet}} {{a woman named}} Alexandra (Mayumi Yanagisawa/Jeannie Elias). She tells them she {{is the owner of}} the Palace, and the moon-person they fought is called Sirus, and is only a child; an orphan whom Alexandra adopted. However, because of the evil inside him, he has {{forgotten}} that time. She asks them to restore the garden of the Palace to try to remind Sirus of his old life. They do so, and confront Griffon, who experiences a memory of Sirus lamenting how humans have nearly destroyed the world fighting for the atlamillia, and musing that things would be better if humans didn't exist. These memories weaken Griffon, and Max and Monica defeat him. He turns back into Sirus, and a Dark Element (Hiroshi Iwasaki/Cam Clarke) rises out of his body, calling the Star of Oblivion. The Element reveals that it was born from Sirus's hatred for humans, and plans to rule over the destroyed planet. Max and Monica defeat the Element, helped by Sirus, who is mortally wounded. Before he dies, he remembers who <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> – the Guardian of the Stars, with the power to stop the Star of Oblivion. He does so, and Alexandra appears, telling him he has done well. He thanks Max and Monica for saving him, and then dies, re-joining Alexandra in the garden. Max and Monica discuss how Griffon never really existed, but was instead an evil created in the heart of humans. At Kazarov, they say goodbye, vowing never to forget one another. Elena also says goodbye to Max as Paznos returns to its own time.|$|E

Yelchin decided to carry on Walter Koenig's speech patterns of replacing [...] "v"s with [...] "w"s, although he and Abrams felt this was a trait more common of Polish accents than Russian ones. He described Chekov as an odd character, being a Russian who was brought on to the show [...] "in the middle of the Cold War."

Jones scored his fifth goal at the Stadium of Light, with a header from the near post off a corner kick, in Sunderland's 3–1 win over Bolton Wanderers on 29 December.Chelsea captain John Terry praised Jones, saying: [...] "Jones was fantastic and I have played against him twice now.

500|$|... "Womanizer" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Britney Spears for her sixth studio album, Circus (2008). It was released on October 3, 2008 by Jive Records as the lead single of the album.

Critics also observed it was a stand-out track from its album and also deemed it as a comeback single for Spears.|$|E

Deep Blue went to sleep within his new body, leaving Masaya with no memories of who or what <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>is,</b> but retaining some of Deep Blue's disgust for the way humans were treating the environment. Despite being the primary antagonist, Deep Blue does not actually appear until the end of the sixth volume of the manga. Deep Blue is cold natured, cruel hearted, and will kill anyone who gets in his way. Upon awakening, he attacks and injures Ichigo as he does not share Masaya's love for her, and kills Quiche without any hesitation when challenged to a duel. This allows Masaya to temporarily re-emerge and release Mew Aqua inside his body, killing them both.|$|E
