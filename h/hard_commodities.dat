40|$|Operating systems {{provide a}} wide range of services, which are crucial for the {{increasingly}} high reliability and scalability demands of modern applications. Providing both reliability and scalability at the same time is <b>hard.</b> <b>Commodity</b> OS architectures simply lack the design abstractions to do so for demanding core OS services such as the network stack. For reliability and scalability guarantees, they rely almost exclusively on ensuring a high-quality implementation, rather than a reliable and scalable design. This results in complex error recovery paths and hard-to-maintain synchronization code. We demonstrate that a simple and structured design that strictly adheres to two principles, isolation and par- titioning, can yield reliable and scalable network stacks. We present NEaT, a system which partitions the stack across isolated process replicas handling independent requests. Our design principles intelligently partition the state to minimize the impact of failures (offering strong recovery guarantees) and to scale comparably to Linux without exposing the implementation to common pitfalls such as synchronization errors, poor locality, and false sharing...|$|R
50|$|Soft {{commodities}}, or softs, are commodities such as coffee, cocoa, sugar, corn, wheat, soybean, {{fruit and}} livestock.

However, using daily data of crude palm oil (CPO) spot and futures prices from January 2000 to July 2016, after {{taking into account the}} variance of the increments in a random walk as measured by variance ratio, our study finds that spot and futures prices are highly correlated during backwardation period. It is further observed that: First, investor demand on the futures market is highly correlated with spot and futures prices during backwardation, but lesser during weak contango, and the least correlated during strong contango. Second, the efficiency of the futures market is related to the degree of correlation between spot and futures price changes. High efficient information transmission in the futures market is linked to a high correlation between spot and futures markets and vice versa. Therefore, we extend the hypothesis that the preference of holding a long position in the futures market is due to the anticipation of insufficient supply of CPO which happens during the backwardation period...|$|R

Hardy argued that Ramanujan’s mathematical genius was grossly mishandled during his prime years of intellectual cultivation by the defunct education system of India at the time. Ramanujan was born in 1887 surrounded by a very normal Indian world. He was raised in southern India in a relatively poor family. His education at the lower levels was for the most part normal, except for the unusual growth he had in mathematics.

Because of his reputation, high wage demands, gigantic transfer fee, and the unserved eight game suspension, Li was a <b>hard</b> <b>commodity</b> to move despite being perceived as heads and shoulders above the rest of the Chinese defenders. But the new AFC Champions League rule came to his rescue as it allowed all tournament participants to have one foreign Asian player. Attracting heavy interest from both the Japanese and Korean leagues, Li moved to K-League side Suwon Samsung Bluewings in January 2009, signing a two-year contract for a reported $400,000 and reuniting him with another one of his former managers. Some pundits suggested that Li moved on a free transfer because Wuhan's withdrawal made all of its players free agents under FIFA's rules. However, Wuhan immediately released statements announcing its intention to obstruct the move if it was not at least partly remunerated and media reports stated that Li would pay his former club himself in order to play for the Korean outfit. In his debut appearance, he was sent off against Sparta Prague in a friendly match in Hong Kong; however, Li redeemed himself in his first official match for Suwon in an AFC Champions League match in a 4-1 win against Kashima Antlers by scoring the opening goal.|$|R

40|$|Most {{database}} systems use ARIES-like {{logging and}} recovery scheme {{to recover from}} failures and guarantee transactional consistency. ARIES relies on the Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) protocol which requires that log records be written durably prior to the corresponding data changes. In order to enforce WAL, database systems rely on the write-through capability of the storage media. While SCSI disks that are commonly deployed in enterprise servers support write-through, <b>commodity</b> <b>hard</b> drives do not. In the past, database systems were mostly limited to enterprise servers; however, today they are being heavily deployed in large-scale internet services and personal information management systems.

40|$|Using a {{structural}} VAR with block exogeneity, diagonality and identifying restrictions, this paper analyzes: first, the macroeconomic linkages among the oil price, U.

By assuming the block exogeneity of U. S. macroeconomic variables {{with respect to the}} international nonfuel commodity prices, the paper discusses how exogenous oil/macroeconomic shocks affect the international commodity prices. It finally explores which oil/macroeconomic shocks are important in explaining the variations in international commodity prices. The results show that the sources of major fluctuations in the international commodities differ greatly by <b>commodity.</b> Soft and <b>hard</b> <b>commodity</b> prices such as those of ‘seafood’, ‘industrial metals’, and ‘gold’ seem to be strongly affected by the financial factor. Moreover, for some commodities, price fluctuations are more affected by the financial factor than by the real factor, supporting the view of “financialization” of commodities. Those commodities include ‘vegetable oils and protein meals’, ‘meat’, ‘seafood’, and ‘industrial metals’. The financial factor is also an important source of fluctuations in the oil prices. Oil price shocks have effects on the volatilities of interest rates, money supply, and general price level instantly, {{as well as on the}} exchange rate instead of the general price two years after the shock. Over the whole forecasting horizon, the degree of exchange rate pass-through is low on the general price level but is positive and high on oil and nonfuel international commodity price...|$|R

Once Perestroika took hold, the barter business diminished and Rovt (along with his childhood friend and co-worker at IBE, Imre Pakh) bought IBE from Silverston and transitioned the company into a traditional fertilizer distributor eventually controlling 85-90% of the fertilizer trade in Russia and the Ukraine by 2000.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that even modern hard disks have complex failure modes that do not conform to “failstop” operation.

Commodity operating systems are required to deal with such failures as <b>commodity</b> <b>hard</b> disks are known to be failure-prone. An important operating system component that is exposed to disk failures is the virtual memory system. In this paper, we examine the failure handling policies of different virtual memory systems for different classes of partial disk errors. We use type and context aware fault injection to explore as many of the internal code paths as possible. From experiments, we find that failure handling policies in current virtual memory systems are at best simplistic, and often inconsistent or even absent. Our fault injection technique also identifies bugs in the failure handling code in these systems. The study identifies possible reasons for poor failure handling, which can help in the design of a failure-aware virtual memory system. 1...|$|R

40|$|With the {{decreasing}} {{cost and}} wide-spread use of <b>commodity</b> <b>hard</b> drives, {{it has become}} possible to create very large-scale storage systems with less expense. However, as we approach exabyte-scale storage systems, maintaining important features such as energy-efficiency, performance, reliability and usability became increasingly difficult. Despite the decreasing cost of storage systems, the energy consumption of these systems {{still needs to be}} addressed in order to retain cost-effectiveness. Any improvements in a storage system can be outweighed by high energy costs. On the other hand, large-scale storage systems can benefit more from the object storage features for improved performance and usability. One area of concern is metadata performance bottleneck of applications reading large directories or creating a large number of files. Similarly, computation on big data where data needs to be transferred between compute and storage clusters adversely affects I/O performance. As the storage systems become more complex and larger, transferring data between remote compute and storage tiers becomes impractical. Furthermore, storage systems implement reliability typically at the file system or client level. This approach might not always be practical in terms of performance. Lastly, object storage features are usually tailored to specific use cases that makes it harder to use them in various contexts. In this thesis, we are presenting several approaches to enhance energy-efficiency, performance, reliability and usability of large-scale storage systems. To begin with, we improve the energy-efficiency of storage systems by moving I/O load to a subset of the storage nodes with energy-aware node allocation methods and turn off the unused nodes, while preserving load balance on demand. To address the metadata performance issue associated with large creates and directory reads, we represent directories with object storage collections and implement lazy creation of objects. Similarly, in-situ computation on large-scale data is enabled by using object storage features to integrate a computational framework with the existing object storage layer to eliminate the need to transfer data between compute and storage silos for better performance. We then present parity-based redundancy using object storage features to achieve reliability with less performance impact. Finally, unified storage brings together the object storage features {{to meet the needs of}} distinct use cases; such as cloud storage, big data or high-performance computing to alleviate the unnecessary fragmentation of storage resources. We evaluate each proposed approach thoroughly and validate their effectiveness in terms of improving energy-efficiency, performance, reliability and usability of a large-scale storage system...|$|R
