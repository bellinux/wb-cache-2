5|$|It {{is unknown}} whether this species obtains {{all of the}} water it needs from its food or if it must also drink; however, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> both {{drinking}} and bathing in pools of water after rain storms.|$|E
5|$|Other predators {{attack the}} adults {{while they are}} {{foraging}} or traveling to satellite nests. It {{is difficult to determine}} the number of adults that are killed away from the nest because they are difficult to track. However, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> that the queen's flight to the satellite nest isn't dangerous and does not reduce its survivability.|$|E
50|$|T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), is a {{recurring}} nova {{in the constellation}} Corona Borealis. It was first discovered in outburst in 1866 by John Birmingham, although <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> earlier as a 10th magnitude star.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> {{for many}} years that strata in {{mountains}} often contained bands of sea shells. Conservative science said that these {{could be explained by}} the Great Flood described in the Bible. Leonardo's observations convinced him that this could not possibly be the case.|$|R
50|$|Mermis nigrescens is {{a species}} of {{nematode}} known commonly as the grasshopper nematode. It is distributed in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. It occurs in Tasmania, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> not <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> on mainland Australia. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> rarely <b>observed</b> in Africa. It is a parasite of insects, especially grasshoppers.|$|R
5|$|Snow in {{the city}} is so rare that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> only five times in the century-and-a-half that records have been kept. In 1949 and 1967, snow stayed {{on the ground for}} a few hours in higher {{locations}} like Point Loma and La Jolla. The other three occasions, in 1882, 1946, and 1987, involved flurries but no accumulation.|$|E
5|$|Dyspanopeus sayi lives {{predominantly}} on muddy bottoms, {{where it}} is a predator of bivalve molluscs. In its native environment, it hides among colonies of polychaetes to avoid being preyed on by the Atlantic blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. It is an important predator of the quahog, Mercenaria mercenaria, in Narragansett Bay, and of the barnacle Balanus improvisus in Delaware Bay. In the Adriatic Sea, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> to feed on the striped venus clam, Chamelea gallina, and the introduced Asian date mussel, Musculista senhousia.|$|E
5|$|P. imperialis {{crossed the}} waters between Australia and New Zealand some time between 1960 and 1972, and {{seedlings}} {{of the previously}} infertile trees of F. rubiginosa began appearing in brick and stone walls, and on other trees, particularly in parks and gardens around Auckland. They have been recorded {{as far south as}} Napier. P. imperialis has been transported to Hawaii, California and Israel, where <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> to pollinate its host.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> on {{frogs and}} toads.|$|R
25|$|In 1673 Huygens {{published}} Horologium Oscillatorium sive de motu pendulorum, {{his major}} work on pendulums and horology. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> by Mersenne {{and others that}} pendulums are not quite isochronous: their period depends on their width of swing, with wide swings taking slightly longer than narrow swings.|$|R
50|$|<b>Its</b> larvae <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> as predators of Coccoidea (Scale insects).|$|R
5|$|Sexual {{maturity}} {{is reached}} {{between the ages}} of 18 and 24 months in females, and can be reached by 17 months in males. It is polyestrous, having many periods of sexual receptivity during a year. In captivity however, there is a clear birth peak between March and May. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> that reproductive patterns of captive prosimians in the northern hemisphere are altered. The estrus cycle lasts 29–45 days, with most copulations occurring on the same day.|$|E
5|$|The debris disk around Beta Pictoris is seen edge-on by {{observers}} on Earth, and is orientated in a northeast-southwest direction. The disk is asymmetric: in {{the northeast}} direction <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> out to 1835 astronomical units from the star, while the southwest direction the extent is 1450 AU. The disk is rotating: the part to the northeast of the star is moving away from Earth, while the part to the southwest of the disc is moving towards Earth.|$|E
5|$|The tiger {{catshark}} is {{a sluggish}} predator of a {{diverse array of}} benthic organisms. Its diet is dominated by bony fishes and crustaceans, and also includes cephalopods, polychaete worms, smaller sharks, and scavenged fish offal. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> at the spawning grounds of the chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudi), feeding on squid that have descended to the bottom to mate and deposit eggs. Documented predators of this species include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) and the ragged tooth shark (Carcharias taurus).|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> only <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> twenty-six {{times over}} four oppositions.|$|R
50|$|When Bradfield {{discovered}} a comet and communicated {{it to the}} International Astronomical Union (IAU), it kicked off world-wide action. Within 14 hours of reporting his 17th comet in 1995, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> by more than 20 observers, including the European Southern Observatory (ESO) 1-meter Schmidt telescope at La Silla, Chile.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>it</b> could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> that he <b>was</b> {{not nearly}} so eager as {{when he first came}} home.|$|R
5|$|A {{very small}} {{proportion}} (those affected by SMAD4 (MADH4) mutations, see below) have multiple benign polyps {{in the large}} intestine, which may bleed or transform into colorectal cancer. A similarly small proportion experiences pulmonary hypertension, a state in which the pressure in the lung arteries is increased, exerting pressure {{on the right side}} of the heart and causing peripheral edema (swelling of the legs), fainting and attacks of chest pain. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> that the risk of thrombosis (particularly venous thrombosis, in the form of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) may be increased. There is a suspicion that those with HHT may have a mild immunodeficiency and are therefore at a slightly increased risk from infections.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{for food}} takes place mostly in fresh water, though the black stork may look for food {{on dry land}} at times. The black stork wades patiently and slowly in shallow water, often alone or in a small group if food is plentiful. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> shading the water with its wings while hunting. In India, it often forages in mixed species flocks with the white stork, woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), {{demoiselle}} crane (Grus virgo) and bar-headed goose (Anser indicus). The black stork also follows large mammals such as deer and livestock, presumably to eat the invertebrates and small animals flushed by their presence.|$|E
5|$|Galerina marginata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, obtaining nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter. It {{is known to}} have most of the major classes of secreted enzymes that dissolve plant cell wall polysaccharides, and {{has been used as a}} model saprobe in recent studies of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Because of its variety of enzymes capable of breaking down wood and other lignocellulosic materials, the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) is currently sequencing its genome. The fungus is typically reported to grow on or near the wood of conifers, although <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> to grow on hardwoods as well. Fruit bodies may grow solitarily, but more typically in groups or small clusters, and appear in the summer to autumn. Sometimes, they may grow on buried wood and thus appear to be growing on soil.|$|E

5|$|Mainly {{active at}} night, the sharptooth houndshark feeds mostly on crustaceans, bony fishes, and cephalopods. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> {{gathering}} in groups {{in shallow water}} during summertime, possibly for reproductive purposes. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the unborn young are sustained mainly by yolk. Females give birth to 6–12 pups between late May and August, on a two- or three-year cycle. The sharptooth houndshark is often hooked by recreational anglers, and some are also captured on commercial bottom longlines. Because of its small range, its low growth and reproductive rates, it is very vulnerable to overfishing. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has therefore listed this species as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|Quite common {{within its}} small range, the {{sluggish}} and reclusive puffadder shyshark {{is often seen}} lying still on the sea floor. It is gregarious and several individuals may rest together. A generalist predator with grasping dentition, the puffadder shyshark is known to take a variety of small benthic prey: crustaceans (including crabs, shrimp, crayfish, mantis shrimp, and hermit crabs), annelid worms (including polychaetes), bony fishes (including anchovies, jack macherels, and gobies), cephalopods (including squid), and fish offal. Overall, the most important component of this shark's diet is crustaceans, followed by polychaetes and then fishes. Males seem to prefer polychaetes, while females prefer crustaceans. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> attacking a common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) by tearing off an arm with a twisting motion.|$|E
5|$|Studies to {{quantify}} this theory {{have shown that}} there is an overall decreased systemic vascular resistance in hepatorenal syndrome, but that the measured femoral and kidney fractions of cardiac output are respectively increased and reduced, suggesting that splanchnic vasodilation is implicated in the kidney failure. Many vasoactive chemicals have been hypothesized as being involved in mediating the systemic hemodynamic changes, including atrial natriuretic factor, prostacyclin, thromboxane A2, and endotoxin. In addition to this, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> that the administration of medications to counteract splanchnic vasodilation (such as ornipressin, terlipressin, and octreotide) leads to improvement in glomerular filtration rate (which is a quantitative measure of kidney function) in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, providing further evidence that splanchnic vasodilation is a key feature of its pathogenesis.|$|E
5000|$|Historically there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> no overall LEA {{policy for}} {{art and design}} {{education}} in Cornwall beyond an accepted notion that Fine Art should be taught at Falmouth School of Art and [...] "applied" [...] Art at Cornwall College, and <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> on several occasions that this anomaly presented the greatest impediment {{to the development of}} a real centre of excellence for art and design education in Cornwall.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> widely <b>observed</b> that {{distributed}} {{collections of}} neurons oscillate within the gamma band of frequencies (typically between 30–80Hz).|$|R
40|$|Conceptual {{model of}} {{sustainable}} development is comprehended as consensus of human, social, economic, technological, cultural development and protection sanation and advance of environment, as well as protection initial natural inheritance and basic eco-systems. It is impossible to separate particular segments of development because sustainable (optimal) development has sensed only if <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>observe</b> as integral unit.

5|$|The {{black mamba}} {{has a wide}} and {{fragmented}} range within sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> in north east Democratic Republic of the Congo, south western Sudan to Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Kenya, eastern Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, southwards to Mozambique, Swaziland, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Botswana to KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, and Namibia; then north easterly through Angola to south eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The black mamba's distribution contains gaps within the Central African Republic, Chad, Nigeria and Mali. These gaps may lead physicians to misidentify black mamba bites and administer an inappropriate antivenom.|$|E
5|$|The city layout can be {{distinctly}} demarcated {{into two}} zones; namely the 'Old Town' before the British introduced their urban architectural styles and the British period of contemporary monuments, bridges and buildings. In {{a study of}} the architecture of Chamba, instituted by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), with the objective of conserving and restoring individual heritage buildings, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> that the urban architecture of Chamba evolved under three distinct phases. The first phase from 930, dating from the Rajput dynasty establishing the capital at Chamba until 1846, the second phase during the British period; and the third phase constituting the post independent period after its merger with the Indian Union in April 1948.|$|E
5|$|The nectar of the ﬂowers {{is sought}} after by insects, bellbirds, tūī and stitchbirds. The leaves and the rough bark provide {{excellent}} homes for insects such as caterpillars and moths, small beetles, ﬂy larvae, weta, snails and slugs. Many {{of these are}} then eaten by birds such as saddlebacks and robins. The rough bark also provides opportunities for epiphytes to cling and grow, and lizards hide amongst the dead leaves, coming out to drink the nectar and to eat the insects. Good flowering seasons occur every few years only. While {{it is said that}} they foretell dry summers, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> that they tend to follow dry seasons.|$|E
50|$|The pagan {{custom of}} burying lamps {{with the dead}} was to provide the dead with the means of obtaining light in the next world; the lamps were {{for the most part}} unlighted. It was of Asiatic origin, traces of <b>it</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> in Phoenicia and in the Punic colonies, but not in Egypt or Greece.
