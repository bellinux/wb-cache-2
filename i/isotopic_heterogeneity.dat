50|$|Nitrogen {{was a key}} {{target element}} because the extent and origin of its isotopic {{variations}} in solar system materials remain unknown. Target material showed that implanted solar wind nitrogen has a 15N/14N ratio of 2.18 × 10−3 (that is, ≈40% poorer in 15N relative to terrestrial atmosphere). The 15N/14N ratio of the protosolar nebula was 2.27 × 10−3, which is the lowest 15N/14N ratio known for solar system objects.

A series of annealing experiments that mimic mantle conditions (i. e. sub-solidus with natural, polycrystalline, texturally equilibrated olivines at low noble gas partial pressures) show that intergranular interfaces (grain boundaries) are major hosts for noble gases in the mantle, and that interfaces can dramatically fractionate noble gases from their radio-parents (U + Th and K). Therefore, noble gas <b>isotopic</b> <b>heterogeneities</b> in the mantle could result from grain size variations. Fine-grained lithologies (mylonites and ultramylonites, for example) with more grain boundaries will have lower U/ 3 He ratios (compared to a coarse grained equivalent), which, over time, will preserve higher 3 He/ 4 He ratios. As predicted by theory of points defect diffusivity, these results show that noble gas diffusion along interfaces is different {{from those in the}} grain lattice itself at low temperatures. However, for grain size relevant of the Earth's mantle, the resulting effective correlated activation energies (Ea) (Ea) and pre-exponential factors (Do/a 2) (Do/a 2) produce similar diffusivities at mantle temperatures for interface- and lattice-hosted helium. Therefore, grain boundaries do not significantly affect helium transport at mantle conditions and length scales...|$|R

The δ^ O of calcite cores {{and most}} of the calcite grain boundaries are grouped around 17 ‰ while two analyses from the calcite-phlogopite grain boundary show depletion to - 1 ‰. A corresponding δ^ C enrichment (only 0. 7 ‰) is also observed. The δ^ C of graphite does not show any heterogeneity. The homogeneity of δ^ O and δ^ C of calcite (except for the local depletion) and δ^ C of graphite indicate that the marbles evolved through prograde and peak metamorphism with possible internal fluid buffering.

The XANES spectra of these samples show a variety of minor absorbances near the C K-edge, attributable to vinyl-keto, aliphatic, carboxyl, and carbonate molecules, as well as possible damage during sample preparation. Each sample exhibits homogeneous C K-edge XANES spectra within the graphite, however, showing no correlation with <b>isotopic</b> <b>heterogeneities.</b> Gradients in the isotope ratios of C, N, O, and Al {{could be due to}} both processes during condensation, e. g., mixing in stellar ejecta and granular transport, and post-condensation effects, such as isotope dilution and exchange with isotopically normal material in the early Solar System or laboratory, the latter of which is a significant issue for high-density presolar graphite grains. It remains unknown whether the mechanisms behind isotope exchange would also affect the local chemistry and therefore the XANES spectra. Ti L-edge XANES from most Ti-rich subgrains match standard spectra for TiC and potentially TiCN. A rare rutile (TiO 2) subgrain has been identified, though it lacks the lowest energy L 3 peak typically seen in standard spectra. Ca has also been identified by EDXS in TiC subgrains, likely due to the decay of live 44 Ti at the time of formation.

The Re-Os isotope results for whole-rock komatiites and chromite separates from Alexo, Dundonald Beach and the Jeesiörova areas, all yield precisely chondritic intial Os isotopic compositions of their mantle sources (gamma-Os = - 0. 1 ± 1. 0, 0. 0 ± 0. 6 and 0. 1 ± 0. 5, respectively), consistent with that for the projected primitive upper mantle. The uniform chondritic initial Os isotopic compositions of these komatiites suggest their derivation from mantle sources that had undergone neither long-term Re-depletion nor enrichments in radiogenic Os- 187. The uniform chondritic initial Os isotopic compositions of the Ti-rich Finnish komatiites also suggest that the processes responsible for high Ti concentrations in the Finnish rocks must have either been coeval with the generation of the rocks or Re and Os were not significantly fractionated during the processes. The uniform Os isotopic compositions of the Precambrian mantle source regions for these komatiites are {{in contrast to the}} variably radiogenic Os isotopic compositions, commonly reported for the present-day ocean island basalts and modern arc-related rocks.

40|$|Measurement of the {{variation}} of the 17 O/ 16 O and 18 O/ 16 O ratios of extraterrestrial materials {{has proven to be}} a key tool in understanding the formation and evolution of the Solar System. This chapter attempts to collate the huge data set of oxygen isotopic measurements of asteroidal material, as sampled by meteorites, in order to understand some of the processes involved in the formation of these primitive bodies and how such events have affected the oxygen isotopic ratios, ultimately offering a window back to the very origin of Solar System and its primordialoxygen <b>isotopic</b> <b>heterogeneity.</b> Oxygen is generally a major element in the gas, liquid and solid phases that have interacted throughout the evolution of the Solar System, its chemical properties ensuring that there is abundant opportunity for reactions and exchange, the details of which can be recorded in the isotopic ratios of the products. Such processes can be crudely subdivided into the following six categories: • Early solar nebular <b>isotopic</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> • High-temperature modifi cation of nebular components • Metamorphism and melting in asteroids • Aqueous alteration in asteroids • Mixing of components/brecciation • Terrestrial weathering It is clear from the isotopic variation in the earliest-formed nebular components, such as refractory inclusions and chondrules, that there was considerable oxygen <b>isotopic</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> in the early solar nebula, spanning over 50 ‰, and perhaps much greater, in both δ 17 O and δ 18 O. The origin of this variation is discussed elsewhere in this volume. However, isotopic exchange between the 16 O-rich solids and 17 O- and 18 O-rich gas phase(s) resulted in a wide range of isotopic variation in these early-formed components, offering insight into the conditions of these processes and the evolution of the reservoirs with time and/or space. Once accreted onto the early planetisemals, much of the primitive nebular components experienced considerable modification. The metamorphism and melting experienced by some of these bodies, most probably the result of heating from the decay of short-lived radionuclides (e. g., 26 Al), resulted in progressive homogenization, within individual bodies, of any original <b>isotopic</b> <b>heterogeneity.</b> Complete homogenization appears to have been achieved in the HED parent body, indicating very high levels of melting and the development of a large magma ocean. The carbonaceous and ordinary chondrite parent bodies experienced more modest heating, sufficient to mobilize water ice that accreted along with the more refractory materials. The subsequent reactions between the liquid and solid phases at low temperature imparted large isotopic fractionations which record some of the conditions of this alteration, such as water:rock ratio, temperature, and isotopic signature, and thus potentially the origin of the water ice. The evolution of the asteroidal bodies has been far from simple, and an important use of oxygen isotope measurements has been in the identifi cation of the components present in some meteorites, the result of breakup, reassembly and mixing of different bodies during impact processing. The final oxygen isotopic signatures imparted into meteorite samples are those associated with terrestrial weathering. The isotopic compositions of the weathering products depend on location (primarily latitude) while the magnitude of the weathering is dependent on many factors, with some meteorites (e. g., highly reduced enstatite chondrites and the matrix-rich CO 3 s) particularly susceptible to such effects. ...|$|E

Although the geochemical characteristics of these komatiites {{have led to the}} belief that these lavas were uncontaminated, radiogenic Os isotopic compositions (?Os = + 20. 2 and + 33. 2) obtained from well-preserved komatiites and olivine separates suggest that the Alexo flow has been contaminated by crust-derived material. These data are compatible with the trace-element enrichment observed in melt inclusions trapped within olivine. Redistribution of Os and Re did occur at least at the mineral scale and most likely during the Grenville orogeny. Hydrothermal fluids were channeled along the contact between the komatiites and their basement, and were responsible for the remobilization of Re or Os (or both) within the sulfides at Alexo and Hart. Matrix and disseminated sulfides from Texmont are located within the pile of cumulates and seem to have escaped this localized alteration. Although the Abitibi sulfides have experienced various degrees of metamorphism (from prehnite–pumpellyite to low amphibolite facies), the initial Re–Os isotopic composition of the flows appears to have been preserved at the whole-rock scale.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} of Archean geochronology is to find isotopic systems that preserve an indication of a rock's primary age {{in spite of the}} effects of later metamorphism. Zircon dating has been used widely with considerable success but not without difficulty, especially in polymetamorphic terrains. Zircons in such cases commonly are found to have lost radiogenic Pb, and despite fractionizing the zircons or abrading them to remove disturbed portions; it often is not possible to define a pattern of Pb loss from which the original age can confidently be inferred. The refinement of techniques to enable extremely small samples, or even single crystals, to be analyzed has contributed greatly to solving the problem but even those techniques cannot resolve the micron scale <b>isotopic</b> <b>heterogeneities</b> within single zircons in which much of their history is recorded. That can only be done by ion microprobe. Progress reports on studies of four Archean rocks, each of which illustrates the power and potential of ion microprobe analysis in solving problems of Archean geochronology are discussed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{contribution}} {{describes the}} {{successful implementation of}} in situ Sr isotope analyses by LA-MC-ICP-MS at the CPGeo-USP. The choice for an analytical configuration using measurements of half-masses allows the accurate assessment of lanthanide interferences, permitting the determination of Sr isotopes in important REE-rich accessory phases, such as apatite. Likewise, the on-peak-zero method effectively corrects the background contribution (both from Kr and residual Sr contributions from previous ablations) to the signals of the unknown samples. The analytical campaigns resulted in an accuracy, in respect to reference TIMS values, better than 57 ppm (~ ± 0. 000057 2 &# 963; SD) for a modern coral and the Batjberg clinopyroxene which impart significant quality to our data. Similarly, {{the majority of the}} stable Sr isotope ratios are close to the accepted values, which also confirms the effectiveness of the method. The achieved accuracy allows the identification and investigation of spatially-controlled <b>isotopic</b> <b>heterogeneities</b> on the micrometric scale in several Sr-rich minerals (apatite, carbonates, plagioclase, and clinopyroxene) with important implications to the understanding of relevant geochemical processes, particularly AFC, source geochemical heterogeneities and magma-mixing...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{examine the}} iron (Fe) <b>isotopic</b> <b>heterogeneities</b> of CI and {{ordinary}} chondrites, we have analyzed several large chips (approximately 1 g) from three CI chondrites and three ordinary chondrites (LL 5, L 5, and H 5). The Fe isotope compositions of five different samples of Orgueil, one from Ivuna {{and one from}} Alais (CI chondrites), are highly homogeneous. This new dataset provides a δ 56 Fe average of 0. 02 ± 0. 04 ‰ (2 SE, n = 7), which represents the best available value for the Fe isotopic composition of CI chondrites and probably the best estimate of the bulk solar system. We conclude that the homogeneity of CI chondrites reflects the initial Fe isotopic homogeneity of the well-mixed solar nebula. In contrast, larger (up to 0. 26 ‰ in δ 56 Fe) isotopic variations have been found between separate approximately 1 g pieces of the same ordinary chondrite sample. The Fe isotope heterogeneities in ordinary chondrites appear {{to be controlled by}} the abundances of chondritic components, specifically chondrules, whose Fe isotope compositions have been fractionated by evaporation and recondensation during multiple heating events...|$|R
