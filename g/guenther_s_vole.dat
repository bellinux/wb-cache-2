40|$|The Martino 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>vole</b> is an {{endangered}} rodent endemic {{to the western}} Balkan Peninsula. Its range is fragmented, and populations are small due to high habitat specificity. The level of genetic variation within such populations is often low, and genetic differentiation between patchily dispersed populations is high. By scoring eight microsatellite loci in 110 individual Martino 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>voles</b> originating from 27 locations throughout the species range, we analysed genetic variation at both the intra- and interpopulation level. Factorial correspondence analysis, Bayesian analyses, and allele sharing distances divided individuals into three phylogroups (Northwestern, Central, and Southeastern), thus providing independent support for phylogeographic structuring, a pattern that has been described in previous studies based on mitochondrial DNA. Spatial genetic analyses showed that populations are highly fragmented, even in those areas with the highest population densities. The highest intrapopulation genetic variability and stable effective population sizes were found in Mount Zelengora (Bosnia and Herzegovina), which harbours a relatively large population of Martino 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>voles.</b> Populations in the Central and Southeastern lineages exhibited a significant isolation-by-distance pattern, indicating limited gene flow between them. Contrary to previous opinion, low effective population size and very limited gene flow between remaining populations suggest that the long-term existence of the Martino 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>vole</b> might not be secure, even in populations that live in optimal habitats. The only threat to the Martino 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>vole</b> identified thus far is competitive exclusion by the European snow vole. However, our results suggest that conservation problems associated with this paleoendemic rodent are more comple...|$|R

40|$|In February, 1953, Dr. Mitoshi Tokuda {{attempted}} {{a collection of}} murine mammals in the neighbourhood of Bochu situated in the submontane zone of Mt. Aso and got 4 individuals of the field mouse, Apodemus speciosus, 3 of the long-tailed field mouse, A. geisha, 2 of the harvest-mouse, Micromys minutus, and 1 of the Smith 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>vole,</b> Clethrionomys smithii, using 50 traps. In the end of June nothern Kyushu was attacked by heavy rains and enormous floods were followed. In the submontane area of Mt. Aso the rainfall was very remarkable and the mass of water flowed over Kumamoto City, causing a great damage on her. Bochu {{was one of the}} centers of maximum rainfall, that of four days being over 900 millimetres. Therefore we went to Bochu area early in December to investigate how was the effect of heavy rains on the murine animals in the submontane zone of Mt. Aso. Using 300 traps we got 10 individuals of A. speciosus, 1 of A. geisha and 1 of C. smithii. And moreover two shrew-moles were trapped. Except the harvest-mouse, all kinds of the murids which Dr. Tokuda got in the same area before the heavy rains, in February, were taken, though our result of collection was not so good owing to our inexperience. The trapped animals were almost adult and considered to have been born before the heavy rains. Judging from the abundant tunnels of the animals distributed over whole area, the total number of the inhabiting murids is thought to be enormous. Though we can say nothing about C. smithii and A. geisha on account of the scarceness of the individuals we got, at least A. speciosus is considered to have almost entirely survived the heavy rains, not receiving any effect of those. 昭和 28 年 6 月末, 九州が襲われた大水害に際して土着の動物が如何なる影響を受けたかは生態学上極めて興味ある問題であるが, われわれはその内特に鼠類に及ぼした影響につき調査を試みた. われわれ人類の住所に侵入し共に暮す住家性鼠類であるクマネズミとドブネズミについては, さきに浸水地である遠賀川と筑後川の流域の農村に於いて調査した所(第 1 報), 興味あることには屋内に棲むクマネズミは天井などの高所に逃れて無事だつたのに対し, 戸外に棲むドブネズミはほとんど全滅に近い打撃を受けているのをみた. 熊本県の内牧から坊中にかけての阿蘇由麓地方は先般の豪雨の時最も降水量の多かつた地域の一つで 4 日間の量が 900 ミリ以上に上つたと云われる. この様な事態に際会してその地域に棲息する野鼠類は如何なる影響を受けたかをみる為, われわれは洪水後約 6 ヶ月を経た去る 12 月の初旬現地に赴いて調査を行つた. 尚, 調査を冬季に行つたのは, 野外に食物の豊富な春・夏・秋の候には野鼠はトラツプにかかりにくいからである...|$|R
40|$|Dinarska voluharica, Dinaromys bogdanovi, je paleoendemični glodavec Balkana in filogenetski relikt. Kljub majhnemu arealu se deli na tri evolucijske linije, ki so geografsko ločene z rekami in v alopatriji ţe pribliţno 1, 3 oz. 0, 3 milijona let. Naš namen je bil analizirati morfološko variabilnost ventralne strani lobanje med spoloma, ontogenetskim razvojem in filogenetskimi skupinami. Zanimalo nas je ali je vzorec morfološke variabilnosti enak filogenetskemu ter ali imajo filogenetske skupine enaka ali različna vzorca spolnega dimorfizma in ontogenetske alometrije. Uporabili smo metode geometrijske morfometrije, s katerimi smo lahko velikost in obliko lobanje obravnavali ločeno. V raziskavo smo vključili 184 lobanj s celotnega območja poselitve, ki smo jih {{a priori}} razvrstili v tri filogenetske in pet starostnih skupin. Z analizo morfološke variabilnosti med spoloma nismo zaznali sekundarnega spolnega dimorfizma v velikosti ali obliki lobanje pri nobeni starosti ali filogenetski skupini. Iz tega sklepamo, da med osebki istega spola ni izrazite kompeticije za parjenje z nasprotnim spolom in da sta spola pod vplivom podobnih okoljskih selekcijskih pritiskov. Z raziskavo ontogenetske alometrije smo ugotovili tesno povezanost oblike in velikosti lobanje. Odnos oblike in velikosti je bil pri vseh starostih linearen. Oblika lobanje se med ontogenetskim razvojem pri vseh treh filogenetskih linijah spreminja enako hitro. Alometrija torej nima pomembnega vpliva na nastanek razlik v obliki lobanje med filogenetskimi skupinami, saj le-te nastanejo ţe v prenatalnem obdobju. Vzorec morfološke variabilnosti se je skladal s filogenetskim. Najbolj se je od ostalih dveh skupin razlikovala severozahodna skupina, ki je v alopatriji z ostalima skupinama ţe pribliţno 1, 3 milijona let. Osebki iz te skupine so imeli najširši gobčni del lobanje in moţganski del lobanje, najdaljšo in na stran pomaknjeno nebno odprtino, navzven ukrivljen niz meljakov in največjo zatilnično odprtino. Ugotovili smo, da ima ventralna stran lobanje dinarske voluharice determinacijsko vrednost, saj omogoča zanesljivo klasifikacijo v filogenetske skupine. Ker med filogenetskimi skupinami v velikosti lobanje ni bilo razlik in ker je bila morfološka variabilnost lobanje kljub alopatriji majhna, sklepamo, da je lobanja dinarske voluharice pod vplivom stabilizirajoče selekcije, razlike v obliki pa so nastale kot posledica procesov nevtralne evolucije. Martino 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>vole,</b> Dinaromys bogdanovi, is a Balkan paleoendemic rodent and a phylogenetic relict. Despite its small area of {{occupancy}} it {{is divided into three}} evolutionary lineages that are geographically separated by rivers and in allopatry for approximately 1. 3 or 0. 3 million years. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze morphological variability of the ventral side of the skull between the sexes, during the ontogenetic development and among phylogenetic groups. We were interested in whether the pattern of morphological variability is the same as the phylogenetic. As well as, whether different phylogenetic groups have the same or a different pattern of sexual dimorphism and ontogenetic allometry. We employed the geometric morphometric methods, which allowed us to analyze the size and shape of the skull separately. The study included 184 skulls from the entire range of the species classified a priori into three phylogenetic groups and five age groups. The analysis of morphological variability between the sexes did not detect the secondary sexual dimorphism in size or shape of the skull at any age or phylogenetic group. We could therefore conclude that the competition between the individuals of the same sex for mating with the opposite sex is not pronounced and that the sexes are under similar ecological selection pressures. The study of ontogenetic allometry showed a close relation between the skull shape and size. The relationship was linear at all ages. During the ontogenetic development, the shape of the skull changed at the same rate in all three phylogenetic lineages. Allometry therefore does not have a significant influence on the development of the skull shape differences among the phylogenetic groupsskull shape differences are probably produced prenatally. A pattern of the morphological variability was the same as the phylogenetic. The Northwestern group, which has been in allopatry for approximately 1. 3 million years, was the most different from the other two groups. Specimens of the Northwestern group had the widest rostrum and neurocranium, the longest and laterally moved incisive foramen, laterally bent row of molars, and the largest foramen magnum. We found out that the identified morphological characteristics have a determinating value and allow reliable classification into phylogenetic groups. Because there were no differences in skull size among the phylogenetic groups and the morphological variability was despite the allopatry small, we believe that the skull of the Martino 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>vole</b> was subjected to a stabilizing selection and shape differences are the result of a neutral evolution...|$|R
40|$|Northern voles and lemmings {{are famous}} for their {{spectacular}} multiannual population cycles with high amplitudes. Such cyclic vole populations in Scandinavia have shown an unexpected and marked long-term decline in density since the early 1970 s, particularly with a marked shift to lower spring densities in the early 1980 <b>s.</b> The <b>vole</b> decline, mainly characterized by a strongly decreased rate of change in numbers over winter, is {{associated with an increased}} occurrence of mild and wet winters brought about by a recent change in the North Atlantic Oscillation. This has led to a decrease in winter stability and has shortened the period with protective snow cover, the latter considered as an important prerequisite for the occurrence of multiannual, high-amplitude cycles in vole populations. Although the vole decline is predicted to be negative for predators' reproduction and abundance, empirical data showing this are rare. Here we show that the dynamics of a predator–prey system (Tengmalm's owl, Aegolius funereus, and voles), have in recent years gradually changed from 3 – 4 yr, high-amplitude cycles towards more or less annual fluctuations only...|$|R

40|$|Some rodents {{specialize}} {{in their use}} of habitats while others occur in a variety of habitats. Although cover density is correlated with habitat use by some species, whether structure affects choice by rodents is unknown. The preferences of habitat specialists and generalists were determined by their time allocation among differing structural variables. Variables included horizontal and vertical density, height of horizontal, and vertical versus horizontal cover. Preference of a mouse was assessed by the percent of time spent with a structural type. The habitat specialists, Gapper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> red-backed <b>voles</b> (Clethrionomys gapperi) preferred greater densities of both vertical and horizontal cover. Clethrionomys showed no preference for height of cover, nor for equal densities of horizontal versus vertical cover. Preferences for the greater density of horizontal cover were similar for the high height of horizontal cover at standard low-light intensity and at no light. Laboratory-reared Clethrionomys, without field experience, expressed stronger preferences than did the wild-reared Clethrionomys. The preferences of a habitat generalist, deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), were tested for height, and densities of horizontal and vertical cover. Wild Peromyscus did not prefer the different heights of horizontal cover nor the different densities of vertical cover. Wild Peromyscus preferred the greater density of horizontal cover. Laboratory-reared Peromyscus preferred the greater density of vertical and horizontal cover. Preferences of Peromyscus were neither as strong nor as consistent as the preferences of Clethrionomys. Vulnerabilities of red-backed voles and deer mice to domestic ferrets werw tested at two densities of vertical cover. Red-backed voles were more vulnerable with less vertical cover. Vulnerability of deer mice did not differ between the different vertical cover densities. Vertical and horizontal cover may reduce the vole 2 ̆ 7 s vulnerability to both mammalian and avian predators respectively. Reduced vulnerability is one explanation for Clethrionomys 2 ̆ 7 inherent preferences for greater cover. Deer mice may use other strategies to evade predators which allow them to use a wider variety of habitats...|$|R
40|$|Breeding {{success for}} {{specialist}} avian predators in northern Fennoscandia is {{highly dependent on}} cyclic vole populations. The 3 - 4 year high amplitude vole cycles once regular to this region have shown significant long term declines in abundance since the 1970 <b>s.</b> The <b>vole</b> decline in Sweden, detected by the National Environmental Monitoring Program, is suggested to have negative consequences on breeding performance for specialist raptors. Complete, long term monitoring data to show this on particularly northern owls are scarce. I compared Tengmalm’s owl to the European kestrel, an increasing generalist, in northern Sweden, and used these as model species for comparing with other northern raptors. Diet compilation for 15 raptors revealed the snowy, great grey, hawk, long and short-eared owls are also small mammal specialists and were placed together with Tengmalm’s owl in an ‘owl’ predator category; the hen harrier, common buzzard, kestrel, and eagle, tawny, Ural, and pygmy owls are generalists and were placed in a ‘kestrel’ predator category; and the rough-legged buzzard is an intermediate placed in a combined owl/kestrel category. I predicted trends for species based on degree of small mammal specialization and model predator category. I suggested those in the owl category should decline, those in the kestrel category should not decline, and rough-legged buzzard should probably decline. Population data for raptors from Sweden, including migration counts from Falsterbo and breeding density of Tengmalm’s owl and kestrel in Västerbotten County, were analyzed against the spring and previous autumn vole food supply indices from Västerbotten County. Migration counts of the common and rough-legged buzzards showed a significant positive relationship with the spring vole index. Breeding density of Tengmalm’s owl and kestrel showed significant positive relationships with the previous autumn vole index (and also spring for Tengmalm’s owl), while mean annual brood size for kestrels was only dependent on the spring vole index. For species with data available from Sweden, only the kestrel showed an increasing population trend. However, breeding density of Tengmalm’s owl, a vole specialist, has declined in northern Sweden since the 1980 s. The specialists placed in the owl category are predicted show similar patterns as Tengmalm’s owl and {{are the most likely}} species that have been {{and will continue to be}} adversely affected by significant declines in vole abundance...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUsing bird song as a {{model to}} {{understand}} generalization in motor learning, Hoffman and Sober recently found that adaptation to pitch-shift of birds’ vocal output transfered {{to the production of}} the same sounds embedded in a different serial context (J. Neurosc 2014). In humans, speech learning has been found to transfer {{as a function of the}} acoustical similarity between the training and the testing utterances (Cai et al. 2010, Rochet-Capellan et al. 2011) but it is unclear if transfer of learning is sensitive to serial order. We investigate the effects of serial order on transfer of speech motor learning using non-words sequences of CV syllables. Three groups of native speakers of French were trained to produce the syllable /be/ repetitively while their auditory feedback was altered in real time toward /ba/. They were then tested for transfer toward /be/ (control), /bepe/ or /pebe/ under normal feedback conditions. The training utterance was then produced again to test for after-effects. The auditory shift was achieved in real time using Audapter software (Cai et al. 2008). Adaptation and transfer effects were quantified in terms of changes in formants frequencies of the vowel /e/, as a function of its position and the preceding consonant in the utterance. Changes in formant frequencies in a direction opposite to the shift were significant for ~ 80 % of the participants. Adaptation was still significant for the three groups in the after-effect block. Transfer effects in the /bepe/ and /pebe/ groups were globally smaller than that of the control group, particularly when the vowel /e/ came after /p/ and/or was in second position in the utterance. Taken together, the results suggest that transfer of speech motor learning is not homogenous and as observed by Hoffman and Sober, depends on the serial context of a sound within the utterance.
