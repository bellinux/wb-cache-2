40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{processing}} may induce changes in the mechanical properties of polymers. These changes are most commonly effects of induced thermal stresses, physical aging, frozen-in strains and molecular orientation. In this work two different <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> <b>polystyrenes</b> processed by thermoforming were considered. The main effect induced by thermoforming was molecular orientation. The degree of orientation was measured on the thermoformed product considered and its effect on the environmental stress cracking behaviour in sunflower oil was studied. The fracture mechanics approach was applied.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to extend the use of P-wave and S-wave ultrasonic wave reflection (UWR) to monitor stiffening and setting of portland cement paste. The research focuses especially on the very early hydration period, during the first hours after mixing. For such purpose, it is necessary to obtain higher measurement sensitivity, in this case by employing a buffer (<b>high</b> <b>impact</b> resistance <b>polystyrene</b> or HIPS) with acoustic impedance that is close to that of cement paste. The use of the HIPS buffer together with a new signal compensating method provide sensitive, accurate and reliable measurements on the stiffening and setting of early-age cement paste. In order to study the stability of the HIPS buffer, UWR responses from various chemical solutions are tested. The ability to characterize solution properties, such as solution concentration and density, with P-wave UWR is reported. UWR responses from dispersed and flocculated alumina suspensions are measured in order to provide deeper understanding of the UWR response from cement paste. P-wave UWR is affected by amount of segregation, and S-wave UWR is affected by extent of flocculation. Based on the findings of these fundamental experiments, P- and S-wave UWR responses from hydrating Portland cement paste are interpreted. Criteria to define set conditions based on UWR are proposed: initial set is defined as the time at which S-wave acoustic impedance of 0. 09 MRayls occurs, and final set by the time at which minimum of the first time derivative of S-wave UWR curve occurs. S-wave UWR is also applied to characterize premature stiffening of cement paste, where premature stiffening is indicated by the rapid linear drop in S-wave UWR in the first hour after mixing. Finally, novel applications of P-wave UWR are proposed for cement paste, including sensing differences in paste w/c, resulting from changes in the solid content (density), and detection of the onset of partial debonding, most likely resulting from autogenous shrinkage of the paste...|$|R

50|$|Cavitation {{is common}} in epoxy resins and other craze {{resistant}} toughened polymers, and is prerequisite to shearing in Izod impact strength testing. During the deformation and fracture of a toughened polymer, cavitation of the strained rubber particles occurs in crazing-prone and non-crazing-prone plastics, including, ABS, PVC, nylon, <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> <b>polystyrene,</b> and CTBN toughened epoxies. Engineers use an energy-balance approach to model how particle size and rubber modulus factors influence material toughness. Both particle size and modulus show positive correlation with brittle-tough transition temperatures. They are both shown to affect the cavitation process occurring at the crack tip process zone early in deformation, preceding large-scale crazing and shear yielding.|$|E

HIPS is a low cost, plastic material that is easy to fabricate and often used for low strength structural applications when impact resistance, machinability, and low cost are required. Its major applications include machined prototypes, low-strength structural components, housings, and covers. In order to produce the graft polymer, polybutadiene (rubber) or any similar elastomeric polymer is dissolved in styrene and polymerized. This reaction allows for two simultaneous polymerizations, that of styrene to polystyrene {{and that of the}} graft polymerization of styrene-rubber. During commercial use, it can be prepared by graft copolymerization with additional polymer to give the product specific characteristics.The advantages of HIPS includes: ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:The damping {{behaviour}} {{of several}} vinyl polymers-poly(methy 1 methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(viny 1 chloride) (PVC), <b>polystyrene</b> (PS) and <b>impact</b> <b>polystyrene</b> (Psi) -was studied {{both as a}} funtion of temperature and strain amplitude. The measurements were performed from room temperature up to the glass transition temperature and shows amplitude dependence at frequencies {{of the order of}} 50 kHz. The data are interpreted in terms of a hyperbolic sine stress dependence of the strain rate, including an effective stress. The activation volume was found to depend on temperature, with values much larger than those given by the usual mechanical tests (tensile, creep and stress relaxation). It is suggested that the nonlinear effects are related to the a relaxation in these materials, since the activation enthalpy is quite similar to the one obtained from the maxima of this relaxation. ...|$|R
50|$|Polystyrene {{generally}} has stiffness, transparency, processibility, and dielectric qualities {{that make it}} useful. However, its low impact resistance at low temperatures makes catastrophic fracture failure when cold more likely. The most widely used version of toughened polystyrene is called <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> <b>polystyrene</b> or HIPS. Being cheap and easy to thermoform (see thermoforming), it is utilized for many everyday uses. HIPS is made by polymerizing styrene in a polybutadiene rubber solution. After the polymerization reaction begins, the polystyrene and rubber phases separate. When  phase separation begins, the two phases compete for volume until phase inversion occurs and the rubber can distribute throughout the matrix. The alternative emulsion polymerization with styrene-butadiene-styrene or styrene-butadiene copolymers allows fine-tuned manipulation of particle size distribution. This method makes use of the core-shell architecture.|$|E

In general, the polymer {{is in the form of}} a filament fabricated from virgin resins. There are multiple projects in the open-sourced community aimed at processing post-consumer plastic waste into filament. These involve machines used to shred and extrude the plastic material into filament. Additionally, fluoropolymers such as PTFE tubing are used in the process due to the material's ability to withstand high temperatures. This ability is especially useful in transferring filaments.Metal and glass may both be used as well, though they are much more expensive and generally used for works of art.|$|E
50|$|In-situ {{aggregate}} formation: Many micro-composites {{form their}} aggregate particles {{by a process}} of self-assembly. For example, in <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> <b>polystyrene,</b> two immiscible phases of polymer (including brittle polystyrene and rubbery polybutadiene) are mixed together. Special molecules (graft copolymers) include separate portions which are soluble in each phase, and so are only stable at the interface between them, {{in the manner of}} a detergent. Since the number of this type of molecule determines the interfacial area, and since spheres naturally form to minimize surface tension, synthetic chemists can control the size of polybutadiene droplets in the molten mix, which harden to form rubbery aggregates in a hard matrix. Dispersion strengthening is a similar example from the field of metallurgy. In glass-ceramics, the aggregate is often chosen to have a negative coefficient of thermal expansion, and the proportion of aggregate to matrix adjusted so that the overall expansion is very near zero. Aggregate size can be reduced so that the material is transparent to infrared light.|$|E

Clipboards generally come in two different designs—single or folding.

Folding clipboards are usually constructed from a single piece of flexible PVC with two rigid materials enclosed within. A folding hinge connects the two sections to allow the front to be folded over the content to provide protection and often to allow some sort of promotional print or instructions. Folding clipboards also provide additional benefits because of the extra space available, allowing the incorporation of pen holders and pockets for storage. The arrival of the microprocessor and Internet age gave rise to high-tech variants of the traditional clipboard, the first being the Ferranti Market Research Terminal that retained a clip, to hold A4 paper sheets (looking like a large clipboard) but recording answers to questions in its electronic memory.|$|E
