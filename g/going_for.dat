5|$|Johnson and the Lions {{faced the}} Atlanta Falcons {{on the road}} on September 7, 2008, in the season opener at the Georgia Dome. As the {{official}} starting wide receiver behind Roy Williams, Johnson led the team in receptions and yards, collecting 7catches for 107yards, which included one 38-yard catch-and-run in the Lions' 34–21 loss. During Week2 versus the Green Bay Packers, he had two key touchdowns late in the game, which sparked a large comeback, though the Lions eventually lost the game, 4825. Both touchdowns catches included a run after the catch (the first catch <b>going</b> <b>for</b> 38yards and the second <b>going</b> <b>for</b> 47yards, both over the middle) displaying Johnson's speed and breakaway ability. He ended the game with 6receptions for 129yards and 2touchdowns. In the following two games, losses to San Francisco and Chicago, Johnson failed to score a touchdown or gain over 50yards receiving. However, against the Minnesota Vikings, Johnson had 4receptions for 85yards and his third touchdown of the season.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{were grouped}} with England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Healy took one catch to dismiss Danielle Hazell from the bowling of Sthalekar.

Three wickets had fallen {{in the space of}} 16 balls, during which only three runs had been added, and England had the momentum, and 42 runs were needed from 34 balls for victory.

In the first match against England, Poulton ran out Laura Marsh, {{triggering}} {{the loss of}} the last four wickets without the addition of a run, in six balls, leaving 15 deliveries unused.

5|$|Things were {{different}} in the county matches. As Bradman wanted to keep Lindwall and Miller fresh for the Tests, he generally gave them a lighter workload against the weaker opposition in the county matches, and the three spinners Ring, Johnson and McCool did more of the work, especially as the 55-over rule did not apply outside the Tests. Ring did the second-most bowling outside the Tests, despite not being in Bradman's first-choice team. Bradman even used Hamence, a reserve batsman, to open the bowling at times, in order to rest his bowlers, {{and in the second}} match against Yorkshire, decided to bat for an extended period instead of <b>going</b> <b>for</b> a win, so that his bowlers could recuperate.|$|E
