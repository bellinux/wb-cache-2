25|$|The {{most common}} poly{{histidine}} tags are formed of six histidine (6xHis tag) residues - which are added at the N-terminus preceded by Methionine or C-terminus before a stop codon, in the coding {{sequence of the}} protein of interest. The choice of the end where His-tag is added will depend mainly {{on the characteristics of}} the protein and the methods chosen to remove the tag. Some ends are buried inside the protein core and others are important for the protein function or structure. In those cases the choice is limited to the other end. On the other hand, most available exopeptidases can only remove the His-tag from the N-terminus; removing the tag from the C-terminus will require the use of other techniques. It is important to take into account that the computer simulation (by molecular dynamic) will <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> choose between options, for example, whether the His-tag must be digested or engineered to the N- or C-terminal.|$|E

500|$|In Chicago, {{he founded}} the Mutual Newspaper Publishing Company in 1886 which {{provided}} advertisements and articles to over 200 newspapers. In 1887, he established the weekly [...] "Saturday Blade", an illustrated newspaper aimed at rural audiences and sold by thousands of newsboys—an innovation at the time. By 1892, the Saturday Blade had the largest circulation of any weekly newspaper in the United States. Boyce's detailed reports of his foreign travels provided articles for the [...] "Saturday Blade" [...] and were reprinted in books by atlas/map publisher Rand McNally. The success of the [...] "Saturday Blade" [...] spawned the W. D. Boyce Publishing Company, which Boyce used to buy or start several newspapers and magazines. In 1892, Boyce bought out the [...] "Chicago Ledger", a fiction weekly publication. In January 1903 {{he founded the}} international [...] "Boyce's Weekly", which advocated worker's rights. Boyce's prominence as a supporter of labor attracted labor/union [...] leaders such as John Mitchell of the United Mine Workers and Henry Demarest Lloyd as writers and editors for [...] "Boyce's Weekly". Eight months later, [...] "Boyce's Weekly" [...] was consolidated with the [...] "Saturday Blade." [...] Boyce also established the selected subject/topical newspapers [...] "Farm Business" [...] in 1914 and [...] "Home Folks Magazine" [...] in 1922. Dwindling sales led to the 1925 merger of the [...] "Blade" [...] and [...] "Ledger" [...] into the monthly [...] "Chicago Blade & Ledger", which was published until 1937. As Boyce's enterprises grew, he insisted on looking after the welfare of about 30,000 delivery boys, who were key to his financial success. Working with them may have helped him {{gain an understanding of}} America's youth. Boyce felt that delivering and selling newspapers taught a youth important responsibilities such as being polite, reading human nature, and handling money. Boyce's focused determination was evident in the advice he gave to young men: [...] "There are many obstacles to overcome, but toil, grit and endurance will <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> overcome them all. Help yourself and others will help you." [...] and [...] "whatever trade you have selected; never swerve from that purpose a single moment until it is accomplished".|$|E

2500|$|A {{technique}} {{attributed to}} Sigmund Freud {{to help in}} making difficult decisions is to toss a coin not actually to determine the decision, but to clarify the decision-maker's feelings.

2500|$|I {{have had}} a most happy life and I want each one of {{you to have a}} happy life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being {{successful}} in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. [...] "Be prepared" [...] in this way, to live happy and to die happy– stick to your Scout Promise always– even after you have ceased to be a boy– and God <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do it.|$|E
