5|$|Intravenous {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for procedural sedation (often {{in combination with}} an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation {{of people who are}} ventilated in critical care units. Midazolam is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but propofol has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> care unit (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action, and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used in the ICU for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} of {{head trauma}} {{is thought to}} be influenced in part by the location and amount of subarachnoid bleeding. It is difficult to isolate the effects of SAH from those of other aspects of traumatic brain injury; it is unknown whether the presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens the prognosis or whether it is merely a sign that a significant trauma has occurred. People with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury who have SAH when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice the risk of dying as those who do not. They also have a higher risk of severe disability and persistent vegetative state, and traumatic SAH has been correlated with other markers of poor outcome such as post traumatic epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and longer stays <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> care unit. However, more than 90 percent of people with traumatic subarachnoid bleeding and a Glasgow Coma Score over 12 have a good outcome.|$|E

Later in the month, he notched his first shutout with the Canucks, stopping 32 shots in a 5–0 {{win over the}} Chicago Blackhawks on October 25. On January 9, 2007, Luongo was voted in as a starting goaltender {{for the first time}} in his career for the Western Conference All-Stars. Six days after the announcement, he was hospitalized after taking a puck to the throat in practice. He spent the night <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> care unit for fears his windpipe would swell shut. Discharged from the hospital on game day, Luongo {{recorded a}} shutout that night against the Montreal Canadiens on January 16, 2007. During the 2007 NHL All-Star Game in Dallas, Luongo was named the Skills Competition's top goaltender and helped the West to a 12–9 win over the East. Late in the season, Luongo recorded his franchise record-setting 39th win in a 2–1 overtime victory on March 9. He surpassed Kirk McLean's 38-win mark set in 1991–92. He went on to finish with a career-high 47 wins, one shy of league-leader Martin Brodeur, who broke Bernie Parent's thirty-three-year-old NHL record of wins in a season. Luongo and Brodeur are considered, however, to have been given an advantage to Parent with the inauguration of the shootout that season by the NHL, allowing more games to be decided with wins, as opposed to ties.|$|E

40|$|Lately, {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} sleep problems. Poor quality sleep, insomnia or intentional sleep shortening are risk factors for cardiovascular disease development, overweight, diabetes and mental disorders. During hospitalization <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ICU <b>the</b> sleep quality <b>in</b> patients usually worsens not only because the disease itself but also owing to other factors, such as fear, anxiety, lack of information on the disease, unfamiliar environment or noisy monitors. The theoretical part is divided into five basic chapters as follows: sleep characteristics, the issue of sleep, cardiovascular disease, meeting sleep needs <b>in</b> patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cardiologic <b>Intensive</b> Care Unit and the intervention of a nurse in meeting sleep needs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sleep laboratory. I set two objectives <b>in</b> my thesis: <b>The</b> first objective: to learn if sleep needs <b>in</b> patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cardiologic <b>Intensive</b> Care Unit are met. The second objective: to identify factors influencing the fulfilment of sleep needs <b>in</b> patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cardiologic <b>Intensive</b> Care Unit. Two hypotheses were suggested: The hypothesis I: sleep needs in patients hospitalized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cardiologic <b>Intensive</b> Care Unit are not met, The hypothesis II: the most percieved factor influencing sleep <b>in</b> patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cardiologic <b>Intensive</b> Care Unit was the change of environment. To achieve the objectives I used the questionnaire method. The research set included patients hospitalized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cardiologic <b>Intensive</b> Care Unit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> České Budějovice hospital, Inc. The obtained data analysis shows that sleep needs in patients hospitalized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cardiologic <b>Intensive</b> Care Unit are not met. The most stressful factors are: the change of environment, monitor noisiness, lights switched on at night, uncomfortable beds and anxiety. The hypotheses were confirmed. The objectives of my thesis were accomplished. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> closing part of my thesis I suggest some solutions to improve patients´ feelings and meet their sleep needs, such as dim lights at night, turned down monitoring apparatuses alarm, patients activation during the day, a calming dialogue with the patient, bed making and airing the room before night. I also enclose some attachments treating the issue of sleep needs...|$|R

25|$|Because ALF often {{involves}} the rapid deterioration of mental {{status and the}} potential for multiorgan failure, patients should be managed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> care unit.

Accordingly, plans for transfer to a transplant center should begin in patients with any abnormal mentation.

Measures appropriate for specific causes of ALF are described in detail later in this chapter.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To analyze {{whether the}} {{patients}} with severe infections, admitted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pediatric <b>Intensive</b> Care Unit of the Hospital de Clínicas of the Universidade Federal de Uberlândia, underwent the active screening for primary immunodeficiencies (PID). Methods: Retrospective study that assessed the data records {{of patients with}} any severe infections admitted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pediatric <b>Intensive</b> Care Unit, covering a period from January 2011 to January 2012, in order to confirm if they performed an initial investigation for PID with blood count and immunoglobulin dosage. Results: <b>In</b> <b>the</b> studied period, 53 children were hospitalized with severe infections <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pediatric <b>Intensive</b> Care Unit, and only in seven (13. 2 %) the initial investigation of PID was performed. Among these patients, 3 / 7 (42. 8 %) showed quantitative alterations in immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, 1 / 7 (14. 3 %) had the diagnosis of cyclic neutropenia, and 1 / 7 (14. 3 %) presented thrombocytopenia and a final diagnosis of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Therefore, the PID diagnosis was confirmed in 5 / 7 (71. 4 %) of the patients. Conclusions: The investigation of PID in patients with severe infections has not been routinely performed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pediatric <b>Intensive</b> Care Unit. Our findings suggest the necessity of performing PID investigation in this group of patients...|$|R

25|$|Cryoablation: Cryoablation is a {{technique}} used to destroy tissue using cold temperature. The tumor is not removed and the destroyed cancer is left to be reabsorbed by the body. Initial results in properly selected patients with unresectable liver tumors are equivalent to those of resection. Cryosurgery involves the placement of a stainless steel probe {{into the center of}} the tumor. Liquid nitrogen is circulated through the end of this device. The tumor and a half inch margin of normal liver are frozen to -190nbsp&°C for 15 minutes, which is lethal to all tissues. The area is thawed for 10 minutes and then re-frozen to -190nbsp&°C for another 15 minutes. After the tumor has thawed, the probe is removed, bleeding is controlled, and the procedure is complete. The patient will spend the first post-operative night <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> care unit and typically is discharged in 3 – 5 days. Proper selection of patients and attention to detail in performing the cryosurgical procedure are mandatory in order to achieve good results and outcomes. Frequently, cryosurgery is used in conjunction with liver resection as some of the tumors are removed while others are treated with cryosurgery.|$|E
