5|$|On September 24, 2014, Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), {{launched}} by the Indian Space Research Organisation, reached Mars orbit. ISRO launched MOM on November 5, 2013, {{with the aim of}} analyzing the Martian atmosphere and topography. The Mars Orbiter Mission used a <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfer</b> orbit to escape Earth's gravitational influence and catapult into a nine-month-long voyage to Mars. The mission is the first successful Asian interplanetary mission.|$|E
25|$|A bi-elliptic {{transfer}} {{can require}} less energy than the <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfer,</b> {{if the ratio}} of orbits is 11.94 or greater, but comes {{at the cost of}} increased trip time over the <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfer.</b>|$|E

40|$|The true optimal transfers, {{including}} {{the effects of}} the inclination and eccentricity of the planets' orbits, between earth and Venus are presented as functions of the corresponding idealized <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfers.</b> The method of determining the optimal transfers using the calculus of variations is presented. For every possible Hohmann window, specified as a continuous function of the longitude of perihelion of the Hohmann trajectory, the corresponding numerically exact optimal two-impulse transfers are given in graphical form. The cases for which the optimal two-impulse transfer is the absolute optimal, and those for which a three-impulse transfer provides the absolute optimal transfer are indicated. This information furnishes everything necessary for quick and accurate orbit calculations for preliminary Venus mission analysis. This makes it possible to use the actual optimal transfers for advanced planning in place of the standard <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfers...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Several {{technologies}} {{have been proposed}} which both save fuel and provide significantly faster travel than the traditional methodology of using <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfers.</b> Some are still just theoretical, but over time, several of the theoretical approaches have been tested on spaceflight missions. For example, the Deep Space 1 mission was a successful test of an ion drive. These improved technologies typically focus on one or more of: ...|$|R
50|$|Some {{celestial}} {{bodies have}} atmospheres of varying heights and densities, affecting {{the impact of}} drag on wings and parachutes. The simulations are accurate enough that real-world techniques such as <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfers</b> and aerobraking are viable methods of navigating the solar system. Aerobraking, however, has become {{a much more difficult}} method of velocity reduction since the full 1.0 release due to improved aerodynamics and optional heating during atmospheric entry. In-game atmospheres thin out into space, but have finite heights, unlike real atmospheres.|$|R
25|$|The {{space agency}} had planned the launch on 28 October 2013 but was {{postponed}} to 5 November following {{the delay in}} ISRO's spacecraft tracking ships to take up pre-determined positions due to poor weather in the Pacific Ocean. Launch opportunities for a fuel-saving <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfer</b> orbit occur every 26 months, {{in this case the}} next two would be in 2016 and 2018.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfer</b> orbit: An orbit {{that moves}} a {{spacecraft}} from one approximately circular orbit, usually {{the orbit of}} a planet, to another, using two engine impulses. The perihelion of the transfer orbit {{is at the same}} distance from the Sun as the radius of one planet's orbit, and the aphelion is at the other. The two rocket burns change the spacecraft's path from one circular orbit to the transfer orbit, and later to the other circular orbit. This maneuver was named after Walter Hohmann.|$|E
25|$|At this time, von Braun {{also worked}} out {{preliminary}} concepts for a manned mission to Mars that used {{the space station}} as a staging point. His initial plans, published in The Mars Project (1952), had envisaged a fleet of 10 spacecraft (each with a mass of 3,720 metric tons), three of them unmanned and each carrying one 200-ton winged lander in addition to cargo, and nine crew vehicles transporting a total of 70astronauts. Gigantic as this mission plan was, its engineering and astronautical parameters were thoroughly calculated. A later project was much more modest, using only one purely orbital cargo ship and one crewed craft. In each case, the expedition would use minimum-energy <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfer</b> orbits for its trips to Mars and back to Earth.|$|E
50|$|For <b>Hohmann</b> <b>{{transfer}}s,</b> {{the initial}} orbit {{and the final}} orbit are 180 degrees apart. Because the transfer orbital plane has to include the central body, such as the Sun, and the initial and final nodes, this can require two 90 degree plane changes to reach and leave the transfer plane. In such cases it is often more efficient to use a broken plane maneuver where an additional burn is done so that plane change only occurs {{at the intersection of}} the initial and final orbital planes, rather than at the ends.|$|R
40|$|We {{define a}} new class of “rapid round trip ” interplanetary {{missions}} for which the principal characteristic is a total mission duration that is 1 or more years shorter than the traditional round trip using <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfers.</b> Round trip missions using <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfers</b> to near-Earth asteroids or other nearby interplanetary objects may require many years. (For example, 8 years for a round trip to a Near-Earth Asteroid at 1. 1 AU.) Consequently, rapid round trips are the only practical means for human space travel to these objects. The Hohmann round trip mission to Mars typically requires about 2. 7 years. Rapid round trips to Mars can be as short as 5 months in total mission duration, but these trips require delta V’s 5 times or more greater than for Hohmann round trips. This paper explores rapid round trip missions that are intermediate in terms of both total mission duration and total delta V required. These are significantly faster and take a greater delta V than Hohmann round trips, but are not as fast and use less delta V than the very rapid missions. For example, an intermediate round trip mission to Mars can have a total duration of 14 to 15 months, stay on the surface of Mars of 2 to 3 months, and a total applied delta V of around 14 km/sec if direct entry is used...|$|R
50|$|To {{get to the}} sun, it is {{actually}} not necessary to use a Δv of 24 km/s. One can use 8.8 km/s to go very {{far away from the}} sun, then use a negligible Δv to bring the angular momentum to zero, and then fall into the sun. This can be considered a sequence of two <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfers,</b> one up and one down. Also, the table does not give the values that would apply when using the moon for a gravity assist. There are also possibilities of using one planet, like Venus which is the easiest to get to, to assist getting to other planets or the sun.|$|R
25|$|Reaching Mercury from Earth poses {{significant}} technical challenges, {{because the}} planet orbits so {{much closer to}} the Sun than does the Earth. A Mercury-bound spacecraft launched from Earth must travel 91 million kilometers into the Sun’s gravitational potential well. Starting from the Earth’s orbital speed of 30km/s, the change in velocity (delta-v) the spacecraft must make to enter into a <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfer</b> orbit that passes near Mercury is large compared to other planetary missions. The potential energy liberated by moving down the Sun's potential well becomes kinetic energy; requiring another large delta-v to do anything other than rapidly pass by Mercury. In order to land safely or enter a stable orbit the spacecraft must rely entirely on rocket motors because Mercury has negligible atmosphere. A direct trip to Mercury actually requires more rocket fuel than that required to escape the Solar System completely. As a result, only two space probes, Mariner 10 and MESSENGER, both by NASA, have visited Mercury so far.|$|E
500|$|Since 1973 {{a number}} of {{automated}} spacecraft have visited Jupiter, most notably the Pioneer 10 space probe, the first spacecraft to {{get close enough to}} Jupiter to send back revelations about the properties and phenomena of the Solar System's largest planet. Flights to other planets within the Solar System are accomplished at a cost in energy, which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft, or delta-v. [...] Entering a <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfer</b> orbit from Earth to Jupiter from low Earth orbit requires a delta-v of 6.3km/s which is comparable to the 9.7km/s delta-v needed to reach low Earth orbit. [...] Fortunately, gravity assists through planetary flybys can be used to reduce the energy required to reach Jupiter, albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} a {{spacecraft}} launched from Earth towards Mars following a <b>Hohmann</b> minimum energy <b>transfer</b> trajectory has a strong tendency to remain well-connected magnetically to Earth, in the early phase of the transfer, or to Mars in the late phase, via the Parker spiral magnetic field. On the return trip, the spacecraft would remain reasonably well-connected magnetically first to Mars and later to Earth. Moreover, good magnetic connectivity occurs on all <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfers</b> between neighboring planets in {{the inner solar system}} out to Mars. We call this hitherto unnamed circumstance the Hohmann-Parker effect. We show consequences of the effect by means of simultaneous cosmic radiation proxy observations made near Earth, near Mars, and at the Mars Science Laboratory on the transfer from Earth to Mars in 2011 / 2012. We support the observations with simulations of the large-scale magnetic field of the inner heliosphere during this period and compare the results with our predictions. The implications of the Hohmann-Parker effect are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The Space Station {{will bring}} a great {{increase}} in rendezvous traffic. Formerly, rendezvous has been expensive {{in terms of time}} and crew involvement. Multiple trajectory adjustments on separate orbits have been required to meet safety, lighting, and geometry requirements. This paper describes a new guidance technique in which the approach trajectory is shaped by a sequence of velocity increments in order to satisfy multiple constraints within a single orbit. The approach phase is planned before the mission, leaving a group of free parameters that are optimized by onboard guidance. Fuel penalties are typically a few percent, compared to unshaped <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfers,</b> and total fuel costs can be less than those of more time-consuming ways of meeting the same requirements...|$|R

2500|$|The <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfer</b> orbit {{alone is}} a poor {{approximation}} for interplanetary trajectories because it neglects the planets' own gravity. [...] Planetary gravity dominates the behaviour of the spacecraft {{in the vicinity of}} a planet and in most cases Hohmann severely overestimates delta-v, and produces highly inaccurate prescriptions for burn timings.|$|E
2500|$|Kerbal Space Program (KSP) is a {{space flight}} {{simulation}} video game developed {{and published by}} Squad for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

The game features a realistic orbital physics engine, allowing for various real-life orbital maneuvers such as <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfer</b> orbits and bi-elliptic transfer orbits.|$|E
2500|$|For interplanetary travel, a {{spacecraft}} must use its engines to leave Earth orbit. [...] Once {{it has done}} so, it must somehow make its way to its destination. [...] Current interplanetary spacecraft do this {{with a series of}} short-term trajectory adjustments. In between these adjustments, the spacecraft simply falls freely along its trajectory. [...] The most fuel-efficient means to move from one circular orbit to another is with a <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfer</b> orbit: the spacecraft begins in a roughly circular orbit around the Sun. [...] A short period of thrust in the direction of motion accelerates or decelerates the spacecraft into an elliptical orbit around the Sun which is tangential to its previous orbit and also to the orbit of its destination. [...] The spacecraft falls freely along this elliptical orbit until it reaches its destination, where another short period of thrust accelerates or decelerates it to match the orbit of its destination. [...] Special methods such as aerobraking or aerocapture are sometimes used for this final orbital adjustment.|$|E

The 4 th worker is a single instance worker that identifies the top ranked objects according to collision probability (and other physical characteristics), normally around 10 pieces of debris. This table of debris is consumed by the 5 th multiple instance worker, which computes the delta-v required by each solid rocket motor to de-orbit a selected target object, the optimum route between target objects, and the delta-v required to transfer between these objects. In our preliminary implementation, the TPP is solved using a ‘brute force’ approach whereby the delta-v s required for every route permutation are calculated by the 6 th worker, and we assume <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfers</b> are employed. The 7 th and final worker outputs a list of problematic debris as well as the removal order which requires the lowest energy.|$|R

Firstly, a high-thrust, low-Isp impulse {{is used to}} place the spacecraft onto an Earth-escape trajectory, possibly performing a lunar swingby. Then, an heliocentric rendezvous with Mars is achieved via low-thrust, high-Isp propulsion, followed by a ballistic capture leading to a final, low-altitude orbit around Mars. Hybrid propulsion transfers outperform chemical <b>transfers</b> (<b>Hohmann)</b> in terms of propellant consumption. Furthermore, a few considerations at system level are also proposed...|$|R
40|$|Weak capture in the {{restricted}} problem of three bodies refers to transitory motion between the primaries. Such behavior has interesting applications in space mission design, notably, in finding optimal transfer trajectories that surpass {{the performance of}} traditional <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfers.</b> The Weak Stability Boundary (WSB) is a mathematical set that describes the collection of points in phase space that support such motion. Two definitions exist for the WSB region: a numerical algorithmic definition and an analytical definition. The numerical algorithmic definition is the most accurate description of the WSB region; however it cumbersome to use in practice and does not {{provide insight into the}} underlying dynamics of the 3 -Body Problem (3 BP). An analytical definition has recently been developed to circumvent the need to integrate trajectories to establish the WSB region in phase space. This definition consists of intersections of a number of different mathematical sets. Though this definition can be implemented easily, it is inaccurate in describing the WSB region: it overestimates the region in phase space and includes regions consisting of invariant tori around the two primaries that do not permit transit. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate a possible improvement of the analytical definition and to visualize the internal structure of the WSB region. The internal structure of the WSB region is probed by using extended-Poincarections, which are Poincarections with an additional dimension indicating orbital stability with respect to one of the primaries. The WSB region is investigated in the Planar Circular Restricted 3 -Body Problem (PCR 3 BP), which is a simplified 3 BP model. The existence of the WSB region and its internal structure are sketched for a number of different Jacobi energy values. From these results, a number of poignant conclusions can be drawn about the underlying dynamics of the PCR 3 BP. The methodology presented to visualize the internal structure of the WSB region is proposed as a robust framework to study other dynamical systems in astrodynamics, such as the three-dimensional Circular Restricted 3 -Body Problem (CR 3 BP) and the Elliptic Restricted 3 -Body Problem (ER 3 BP), which are interesting for space mission design.

40|$|Today, humans explore deep-space {{locations}} such as Mars, asteroids, and beyond, vicariously here on Earth, with noteworthy success. However, {{to achieve}} the revolutionary breakthroughs that have punctuated {{the history of science}} since the dawn of the Space Age has always required humans as "the discoverers," as Daniel Boorstin contends in this book of the same name. During Apollo 17, human explorers on the lunar surface discovered the "genesis rock," orange glass, and humans in space revamped the optically crippled Hubble Space Telescope to enable some of the greatest astronomical discoveries of all time. Science-driven human exploration is about developing the opportunities for such events, perhaps associated with challenging problems such as whether we can identify life beyond Earth within the universe. At issue, however, is how to safely insert humans and the spaceflight systems required to allow humans to operate as they do best in the hostile environment of deep space. The first issue is minimizing the problems associated with human adaptation to the most challenging aspects of deep space space radiation and microgravity (or non-Earth gravity). One solution path is to develop technologies that allow for minimization of the exposure time of people to deep space, as was accomplished in Apollo. For a mission to the planet Mars, this might entail new technological solutions for in-space propulsion that would make possible time-minimized transfers to and from Mars. The problem of rapid, reliable in-space transportation is challenged by the celestial mechanics of moving in space and the so-called "rocket equation. " To travel to Mars from Earth in less than the time fuel-minimizing trajectories allow (i. e., <b>Hohmann</b> <b>transfers)</b> requires an exponential increase in the amount of fuel. Thus, month-long transits would require a mass of fuel as large as the dry mass of the ISS, assuming the existence of continuous acceleration engines. This raises the largest technological stumbling block to moving humans on site as deep-space explorers, delivering the masses required for human spaceflight systems to LEO or other Earth orbital vantage points using the existing or projected fleet of Earth-to-orbit (ETO) launch vehicles. Without a return to Saturn V-class boosters or an alternate path, one cannot imagine emplacing the masses that would be required for any deep-space voyage without a prohibitive number of Shuttle-class launches. One futurist solution might involve mass launch systems {{that could be used to}} move the consumables, including fuel, water, food, and building materials, to LEO in pieces rather than launching integrated systems. This approach would necessitate the development of robotic assembly and fuel-storage systems in Earth orbit, but could provide for a natural separation of low-value cargo (e. g., fuel, water) ...|$|R
