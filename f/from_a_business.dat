5|$|His first wife, Edith Linda Druce, {{died from}} lymphoid leukaemia in 1973, after a {{four-year}} struggle. During her final years, Burnet refused all offers of lectures overseas {{to spend more}} time nursing his ailing wife. For a period after this he became very lethargic and reclusive, numbed by his wife's death. He then moved into Ormond College for company, and resumed beetle collecting, but for a year after her death, Burnet tried to alleviate his grief by writing mock letters to her once a week. Gradually he regained his enthusiasm and began writing again. In 1975, he travelled to California to deliver a series of lectures. In 1976 he married Hazel G. Jenkins, a widowed former singer <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> family in her 70s who was working in the microbiology department as a librarian, and moved out of Ormond College.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 2009â€“10 season, Jovanovski missed ten {{games with}} a lower-body injury in November and December 2009. Shortly after {{returning}} to the Coyotes lineup, he was suspended for two games by the NHL for a hit {{to the head of}} Minnesota Wild forward Andrew Ebbett with his forearm on December 7, 2009. The following month, he received another two-game suspension for elbowing New York Islanders rookie forward John Tavares in the head. Over 66 games during the season, he notched 10 goals and 34 points. He was overtaken as the team's top-scoring defenceman by Keith Yandle, who had scored 41 points. While the season was marked with an uncertain future for the Coyotes <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> perspective, as the franchise had filed for bankruptcy in May 2009 and was taken over by the NHL, the team performed well and recorded their best season in history. With 50 wins and 107 points (a 28-point improval from the previous season), they finished with the third best record in the West and came within five points of a Pacific Division and Conference title, trailing only the San Jose Sharks. Facing the Detroit Red Wings in the opening round, the Coyotes were eliminated in seven games. Jovanovski had one goal and no assists in his first NHL playoffs since 2004.|$|E

5|$|On {{a flight}} home <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> trip, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden, a soap {{salesman}} {{with whom he}} begins to converse after noticing the two share {{the same kind of}} briefcase. After the flight, the Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. With no one else to contact, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. After a conversation about consumerism, outside the bar, Tyler chastises the Narrator for his timidity about needing a place to stay. Tyler requests that the Narrator hit him, which leads the two to engage in a fistfight. The Narrator moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house in an industrial area of their city. They have further fights outside the bar on subsequent nights, and these fights attract growing crowds of men. The fighting eventually moves to the bar's basement where the men form a club ("Fight Club") which routinely meets only to provide an opportunity for the men to fight recreationally.|$|E
25|$|Should {{confidential}} {{information about a}} business' customers or finances or new product line {{fall into the hands}} of a competitor or a black hat hacker, a business and its customers could suffer widespread, irreparable financial loss, as well as damage to the company's reputation. <b>From</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> perspective, information security must be balanced against cost; the Gordon-Loeb Model provides a mathematical economic approach for addressing this concern.|$|E

25|$|Corporate magic {{or trade}} show magic uses magic as a {{communication}} and sales tool, {{as opposed to just}} straightforward entertainment.

Uthman thus {{became one of the}} earliest converts to Islam, following Ali, Zayd, Abu Bakr and a few others. His conversion to Islam angered his clan, the Banu Ummayyah, who strongly opposed Muhammad's teachings.|$|E
50|$|Revenues <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>business's</b> primary {{activities}} are reported as sales, sales revenue or net sales. This includes product returns and discounts for early payment of invoices.

50|$|A {{drawback}} to supplier convergence <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>business's</b> perspective can occur {{when a company}} applies convergence {{in such a way}} that makes it inconvenient for customers, and thus backfires on the company. For example, Belgian telecom company Belgacom decided in the late 1990s to combine fixed and mobile phone services into a single subscription. The plan failed, however, when customers wanted to keep these services separate and the company had technical difficulties in producing a single bill for two services (Shankar 2003).|$|R
25|$|Western astrology {{is based}} mainly upon the {{construction}} of a horoscope, which is a map or chart of the heavens at a particular moment. The moment chosen {{is the beginning of the}} existence of the subject of the horoscope, as it is believed that the subject will carry with it the pattern of the heavens from that moment throughout its life. The most common form of horoscope is the natal chart based on the moment of a person's birth; though in theory a horoscope can be drawn up for the beginning of anything, <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> enterprise to the foundation of a nation state.|$|E

25|$|The Grands Magasins Dufayel {{was a huge}} {{department}} store with inexpensive prices built in 1890 {{in the northern part}} of Paris, where it reached a very large new customer base in the working class. In a neighborhood with few public spaces, it provided a consumer version of the public square. It educated workers to approach shopping as an exciting social activity, not just a routine exercise in obtaining necessities, in the same way as the bourgeoisie did at the famous {{department store}}s in the central city. Like the bourgeois stores, it helped transform consumption <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> transaction into a direct relationship between consumer and sought-after goods. Its advertisements promised the opportunity to participate in the newest, most fashionable consumerism at reasonable cost. The latest technology was featured, such as cinemas and exhibits of inventions such as X-ray machines (that could be used to fit shoes) and the gramophone.|$|E

25|$|Northeast Airlines Flight 946 was a {{domestic}} U.S. flight from Boston, Massachusetts, to Montpelier, Vermont, with a refueling stop in Lebanon, New Hampshire, operated by Northeast Airlines. On October 25, 1968, some {{time during the}} evening, the Fairchild Hiller FH-227 aircraft crashed on Moose Mountain while descending on approach. The crash killed 32 of 42 passengers and crew. Of the fatalities, four were employees from the National Life Insurance Company who were returning <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> trip. The fatalities also included {{a reporter for the}} Barre Daily Times and six social workers of the Vermont Head Start Supplementary Training Program on a conference trip, including Abraham H. Blum, Doctorate of Child Development. Ten passengers survived the crash with minor or moderate injuries. After the crash, Northeast Airlines continued flight service until its merger with Delta Air Lines in the early 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Flight 434 {{landed in}} Cebu at 6:50 a.m., after a flight time of 1 hour 15 minutes. At 8:38 a.m., after a 38-minute delay, due to airport congestion, the plane {{took off with}} a total of 273 {{passengers}} on board, among them, 24-year-old , a Japanese industrial sewing machine maker returning <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> trip to Cebu, occupying seat 26K. At 11:43 a.m., 4 hours after Yousef planted his bomb, the device exploded underneath Ikegami, killing him and injuring an additional 10 passengers in adjacent seats in front of and behind seat 26K. The blast blew off a two-square-foot (0.2mÂ²) portion of the cabin floor, and the cabin's rapid expansion from the explosion severed several control cables in the ceiling that controlled the plane's right aileron, as well as cables that connected to both the Captain and First Officer's steering controls.|$|E
25|$|The novel then flashes back {{to before}} the explosion, taking the {{perspective}} of Winnie Verloc and her mother. At home, Mrs. Verloc's mother informs the family that she intends {{to move out of}} the house. Mrs. Verloc's mother and Stevie use a hansom which is driven by a man with a hook in the place of his hand. The journey greatly upsets Stevie, as the driver's tales of hardship, whipping of his horse, and menacing hook scare Stevie to the point where Mrs. Verloc must calm him down. On Verloc's return <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> trip to the continent, his wife tells him of the high regard that Stevie has for him and she implores her husband to spend more time with Stevie. Verloc eventually agrees to go for a walk with Stevie. After this walk, Mrs. Verloc notes that her husband's relationship with her brother has improved. Verloc then tells his wife that he has taken Stevie to go and visit Michaelis, and that Stevie would stay with him in the countryside for a few days.|$|E

25|$|When {{specifically}} {{questioned about}} Robert Piest, Gacy confessed to strangling the youth {{at his house}} {{on the evening of}} December 11 after luring him there, adding that he had been interrupted by a phone call <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> colleague while doing so; he also admitted to having slept alongside the youth's body that evening before disposing of the corpse in the Des Plaines River the following evening. The reason he had arrived at the Des Plaines police station in a dirty and disheveled manner {{in the early hours of}} December 13 was that he had been in a minor traffic accident after disposing of Piest's body, en route to his appointment with Des Plaines officers. In this accident, his vehicle had slid off an ice-covered road, and he had unsuccessfully attempted to free the vehicle himself before the vehicle had to be towed from its location. He also confessed to police he had buried the body of John Butkovitch in his garage. To assist officers in their search for the victims buried in his house, Gacy drew a diagram of his basement to show where the bodies were buried.|$|E
25|$|The IRA's attack {{involved}} two teams. One {{team would}} drive a digger with {{a bomb in}} its bucket through the base's perimeter fence and light the fuse. At the same time, the other team would arrive in a van and open fire on the base, {{with the goal of}} killing three RUC officers as they came off duty. Both teams would then leave the area in the van. To avoid security checkpoints, the bomb was ferried by boat across Lough Neagh, from Ardboe to Maghery. The van and digger that would be used were hijacked in the hours leading up to the attack. The van, a blue Toyota HiAce, was stolen by masked men <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> in Dungannon. At about the same time, the unit's commander Jim Lynagh was spotted in the town, suggesting the van may be used in the attack. The digger (a backhoe loader) was taken from a farm at Lislasly Road, about two miles west of Loughgall. Two IRA members stayed at the farm to stop the owners raising the alarm. IRA member Declan Arthurs drove the digger, while two others drove ahead of him in a scout car. The rest of the unit travelled in the van from another location, presumably also with a scout car. When a covert observation post monitoring the digger reported that it was being moved, the SAS took up its positions.|$|E
