5000|$|In 2014, {{writing for}} CNN, <b>Kelly</b> <b>Wallace</b> {{suggested}} that Davis' accomplishments will affect both girls and boys, women and men. In Wallace's view, she will inspire girls {{who want to}} play baseball in the future. To support this view, Wallace cited the case of Stephanie Tuck, who, as a girl, played on a Little League team. Tuck, recounting the experience of Little league play, said [...] "I was heckled by the dads: 'Get that girl off the field.' I used to literally pray the ball would not come to me in right field, as the pressure was so intense." [...] Wallace also wrote that Davis' play will remove the [...] "specialness" [...] of girls playing {{at the level of}} boys. In the future, fans will look at how good a player is, and gender will not be important. For men and boys, Wallace argued that Davis' performance will reduce gender biases about the roles of boys and girls. [...] For example, [...] "Throwing like a girl", according to Wallace, now has a completely different and positive meaning. Melissa Isaacson, writing for ABC News, expressed similar views. [...] Wallace also speculated that the more attention female athletes such as Davis receive from girls, boys, men, and women, the more popular women's sports will become. Finally, Wallace suggested that the tremendous interest that Davis has piqued in the Little League World Series might lead to increased participation of both boys and girls in baseball, which has suffered from major league [...] "performance-enhancing drug scandals".|$|E

5000|$|The two {{different}} debates received rather different analyses {{in terms of}} the performances of the candidates. In the lower tier debate with only 7 candidates, Carly Fiorina was overwhelmingly considered the best debater, while Perry and Jindal were also praised, and Gilmore, Graham, Pataki, and Santorum were criticized. In the primetime debate, frontrunner Donald Trump’s overall performance was criticized as rude and erratic by many pundits, while others said his comments were popular and his criticisms were overdue, including his criticism of Bush's description of illegal immigration as an [...] "act of love." [...] Cruz, Rubio, Christie, and Huckabee received praise. Notable conflicts between candidates included Rand Paul vs. Christie over the NSA surveillance program, Paul vs. Trump on the latter's possible third-party run, Paul vs. Trump on healthcare, and Christie vs. Huckabee on the issue of welfare reform.

Because of a rule-change announced by FOX one week before the debate-invitations went out, Graham, Pataki, and Gilmore were allowed to participate at 5 p.m. despite averaging below 1% in the five selected polls. (Former IRS Commissioner Mark Everson was excluded from the 5 p.m. tier, along with other relatively unknown candidates who did not meet the updated invitation-criteria of [...] "consistently being offered to respondents in major national polls as recognized by Fox News.") The five selected polls were conducted by Fox News, Bloomberg, CBS News, Monmouth University, and Quinnipiac University.|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to the hegemony of metafictional and self-conscious irony in contemporary fiction, writer David Foster Wallace predicted, in his 1993 essay [...] "E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction", a new literary movement which would espouse something like the New Sincerity ethos:"The next real literary “rebels” in this country might well emerge as some weird bunch of anti-rebels, born oglers who dare somehow {{to back away from}} ironic watching, who have the childish gall actually to endorse and instantiate single-entendre principles. Who treat of plain old untrendy human troubles and emotions in U.S. life with reverence and conviction. Who eschew self-consciousness and hip fatigue. These anti-rebels would be outdated, of course, before they even started. Dead on the page. Too sincere. Clearly repressed. Backward, quaint, naive, anachronistic. Maybe that’ll be the point. Maybe that’s why they’ll be the next real rebels. Real rebels, as far as I can see, risk disapproval. The old postmodern insurgents risked the gasp and squeal: shock, disgust, outrage, censorship, accusations of socialism, anarchism, nihilism. Today’s risks are different. The new rebels might be artists willing to risk the yawn, the rolled eyes, the cool smile, the nudged ribs, the parody of gifted ironists, the “Oh how banal”. To risk accusations of sentimentality, melodrama. Of overcredulity. Of softness. Of willingness to be suckered by a world of lurkers and starers who fear gaze and ridicule above imprisonment without law. Who knows."This was further examined on the blog Fiction Advocate:"The theory is this: Infinite Jest is Wallace’s attempt to both manifest and dramatize a revolutionary fiction style that he called for in his essay “E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction.” The style is one in which a new sincerity will overturn the ironic detachment that hollowed out contemporary fiction {{towards the end of the}} 20th century. Wallace was trying to write an antidote to the cynicism that had pervaded and saddened so much of American culture in his lifetime. He was trying to create an entertainment that would get us talking again."In his 2010 essay [...] "David Foster Wallace and the New Sincerity in American Fiction", Adam <b>Kelly</b> argues that <b>Wallace's</b> fiction, and that of his generation, is marked by a revival and theoretical reconception of sincerity, challenging the emphasis on authenticity that dominated twentieth-century literature and conceptions of the self. Additionally, numerous authors have been described as contributors to the New Sincerity movement, including Jonathan Franzen, Zadie Smith, Dave Eggers, Stephen Graham Jones, and Michael Chabon.|$|R
