50|$|Quite a {{few players}} in this process are conserved across all the plants studied.

For example, rice is a short-day plant, while Arabidopsis thaliana is a long-day plant. Now, in both plants, the proteins CO and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) are present. But, in Arabidopsis thaliana, CO enhances FT production, while in rice, the CO homolog represses FT production, resulting in completely opposite downstream effects.|$|E

50|$|Serratia is a genus of Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, endosporeforming, {{rod-shaped}} bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family. The {{most common}} and pathogenic of the species in the genus, S. marcescens, is normally the only pathogen and usually causes nosocomial infections. However, rare strains of S. plymuthica, S. liquefaciens, S. rubidaea, and S. odoriferae have caused diseases through infection. S. marcescens is typically found in showers, toilet bowls, and around wetted tiles.Members of this genus produce characteristic red pigment, prodigiosin, and can be distinguished from {{other members of the}} Enterobacteriaceae family by their unique production of three enzymes: DNase, lipase, and gelatinase. A pan-genome analysis of the genus Serratia revealed that it does not depict exceptional <b>genetic</b> <b>conservation</b> or diversity as compared to other bacterial genera.|$|E

The current state of plant <b>genetic</b> resources <b>conservation</b> was analyzed {{in the context of}} the threat of gene­tic erosion. The importance of DNA banks was shown which function is to store DNA samples and associated products and disseminate them for research purposes. The main DNA banks in the world were described, including the Republican DNA Bank of Human, Animals, Plants and Microorganisms at the Institute of Genetics and Cytology of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus. Stages of DNA banking were considered: tissue sampling (usually from leaves), cell destruction, DNA extraction, DNA storage. Different methods of tissue sampling, extraction and DNA storage were compared. The need for Plant DNA Bank creation in Ukraine was highlighted. Conclusions. DNA collections is an important resource in the global effort to overcome the crisis in biodiversity, for managing world genetic resources and maximi­zing their potential...|$|R
