50|$|The conifer <b>swift</b> <b>moth</b> (Korscheltellus gracilis) is a <b>swift</b> <b>moth</b> {{considered}} a forest pest in {{eastern and central}} North America, from Canada south to North Carolina. Larvae feed primarily on roots of evergreen trees, and are weakly polyphagous, able to survive on deciduous trees (e.g. birches, Betula) but preferring balsam fir and red spruce. They penetrate bark, but lesions on roots are shallow. These wounds may, however, provide easy entry for pathogenic fungi and nematodes. K. gracilis {{has been shown to}} reduce survival on saplings, but adult trees have been found with more than 30 feeding scars on their roots. But trees that are weakened by air pollution or changes in soil chemistry may invite K. gracilis infestation. Adults can be found in woody areas between June and August. They are cryptically colored, but are active for 20-40 minutes each dawn and twilight, and occasionally come to light. In the conifer <b>swift</b> <b>moth,</b> courtship, mating, and egg laying occur during evening hours; only oviposition occurs in the morning. They are Exoporia, and females scatter eggs while in flight. It takes two years for the larvae to mature, so populations tend towards two-year cycles. Females emit pheromones to attract males, from organs on their hind wings.|$|R
50|$|Heteroneura is {{a natural}} group (or clade) in the insect order Lepidoptera that {{comprises}} over 99% of all butterflies and moths. This is the sister group of the infraorder Exoporia (<b>swift</b> <b>moths</b> and their relatives), and is characterised by wing venation which is not similar or homoneurous in both pairs of wings.|$|R

5|$|Abantiades latipennis, {{known as}} the Pindi moth, is a species of moth in the Hepialidae family. It may also be {{referred}} to as a <b>swift</b> <b>moth</b> or a ghost moth, as this is a common name associated with Hepialidae. Endemic to Australia and identified in 1932, it is most populous in temperate rainforest where eucalypti are prevalent, as the larvae feed primarily on the roots of these trees. Females lay eggs during flight in a scattering fashion. The larvae live for over eighteen months underground, while adult moths survive for approximately one week, as they have no mouthparts with which to feed. The moths are preyed upon by a number of predators, including bats and owls. Brown in colour overall, males are paler and the identifying silver bars of the male's wings are more prominent than those of the female's, with dark margins. Male adults are generally smaller.|$|R

40|$|Gene duplications {{within the}} conserved Hox cluster are rare in animal evolution, but in Lepidoptera {{an array of}} {{divergent}} Hox-related genes (Shx genes) has been reported between pb and zen. Here, we use genome sequencing of five lepidopteran species (Polygonia c-album, Pararge aegeria, Callimorpha dominula, Cameraria ohridella, Hepialus sylvina) plus a caddisfly outgroup (Glyphotaelius pellucidus) to trace {{the evolution of the}} lepidopteran Shx genes. We demonstrate that Shx genes originated by tandem duplication of zen early in the evolution of large clade Ditrysia; Shx are not found in a caddisfly {{and a member of the}} basally diverging Hepialidae (<b>swift</b> <b>moths).</b> Four distinct Shx genes were generated early in ditrysian evolution, and were stably retained in all descendent Lepidoptera except the silkmoth which has additional duplications. Despite extensive sequence divergence, molecular modelling indicates that all four Shx genes have the potential to encode stable homeodomains. The four Shx genes have distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns in early development of the Speckled Wood butterfly (Pararge aegeria), with ShxC demarcating the future sites of extraembryonic tissue formation via strikingly localised maternal RNA in the oocyte. All four genes are also expressed in presumptive serosal cells, prior to the onset of zen expression.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the timing of}} the crepuscular lekking flight of male ghost <b>swift</b> <b>moths</b> in southern Sweden with respect to variations in: (i) the quality of the visual mating signal; and (ii) the behaviour of potential vertebrate predators (mainly bats). The moths' display flights started ca. 57 min after sunset, and occurred during 20 – 30 min at incident light intensities between 10. 0 and 2. 0 lux. Owing to the falling and more shortwave ambient light after sunset, the brightness contrast between the moth wings and the background (grass) increased steeply at the time of display onset. The silvery white male wing colour thereby seems to maximize conspicuousness, and may be a secondary adaptation that facilitates visibility at low light intensities. The display timing itself is probably determined by other factors, possibly predation. By displaying only for a short period at dusk, the moths seem to avoid most birds, which normally do not forage at these light levels, and gleaning bats, which typically do not start to feed until the light intensity has fallen even further. Nevertheless, aerial-hawking bats were often (54 % of the evenings, n = 22) seen at the leks, and one species (Eptesicus nilssonii) frequently fed on the displaying moths (22 % of the moths observed, n = 83). H. humuli represents an ancient clade among the Lepidoptera. By restricting its sexual behaviour to a short time window at dusk, when predation risk may be minimized (but still high), it may to some extent compensate for the lack of sophisticated predator defence systems such as aposematic or mimetic coloration, manoeuvrable flight, and ultrasonic hearing, which predominate among the more recent Lepidopteran clades. However, the time window solution restricts the moths' activities considerably and the lack of defence still carries a considerable cost in terms of predation...|$|R

40|$|Leptographium {{have been}} known since {{the early part of}} the 20 th Century and include of many species causing blue stain of timber. Among these species are several species known or {{believed}} to be involved in causing diseases of trees. Leptographium spp. occur mainly on conifers and many species are recognized as anamorphs of Ophiostoma. Similar to Ophiostoma, Leptographium spp. are closely associated with insects. Their morphology thus reflects this association, and they thus have upright conidiophores with slimy masses that are produced in beetle galleries. Leptographium spp. are morphologically very similar to each other and this makes their accurate identification difficult. The first part of this thesis, presents dichotomous, as well as synoptic keys for the identification of these species. These keys are supported by comprehensive descriptions accompanied by both photographs and line drawings. The second part of this thesis. deals with several key taxonomic questions pertaining to Leptographium. Chapter one represents a phylogenetic study of the majority of species in Leptographium. Morphological characters were coded and analyzed. The results of the molecular and the morphological analyses are compared to determine whether any morphological characters might be used to infer phylogeny. The results indicate that morphology does not infer phylogenetic relatedness. Chapter two represents a comparison between Leptographium abietinum and L. engelmannii. These species are morphologically similar, and various authors have suggested that they are synonyms. Based on morphology, L. engelmanni was synonomised with L. abietinum. Furthermore, examination of various atypical isolates led to the description of the new species, L. hughesii. In chapter three, Ophiostoma europhioides, O. piceaperdum and Ceratocystis pseudoeurophioides are compared. These species have Leptographium anamorphs and are morphologically identical. Both O. europhioides and C. pseudoeurophioides are synonymised with O. piceaperdum, and a name is provided for the anamorph of O. piceaperdum. Chapter four represents a re-evaluation of Phialocepha/a phycomyces. The inconspicuous collarettes, characteristic of this fungus, are unlike the deep¬seated collarettes of the type species of Phialocepha/a (P. dimorphospora). Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed that conidiogenesis in P. phycomyces is phialidic, placing this species among other Phialocephala spp. However, P. phycomyces is able to tolerate high concentrations of cycloheximide, characteristic of Leptographium spp. DNA analysis indicates that this species does not belong in either Phialocepha/a or Leptographium. A new genus Kendrickiella is described to accommodate this species. In chapter five, a new species of Leptographium, L. eucalyptophilum, is described. This species is unique in that it occurs on Eucalyptus, which is an unusual host for this species. In addition, this species is one of several described from tropical regions and it is apparently adapted to this habitat. Chapter six represents a critical re-evaluation of isolates identified as L. procerum. Morphological comparison of these isolates revealed that L. procerum sensu lato, represents more than one taxon. From this study, three new species of Leptographium were described. These are L. alethinum, L. pityophilum and L. euphyes. These species can easily be distinguished from L. procerum s. str. and their incorrect identification is probably as a result of their shared habitat. In chapter seven, I describe an additional three species of Leptographium. Like most other Leptographium spp., these were isolated from conifers. The first of these, L. pineti, originates from Indonesia. The other two species is found in high elevation sites in Eastern North America. These are L. abicolens and L. peucophilum. These species are unique in that they are associated with the conifer <b>swift</b> <b>moth,</b> which is an unusual insect associate of Leptographium. Chapter eighth presents a description of a new species of Leptographium from Russia. This species, L. sibiricum, is associated with staining and mortality in siberian fir (Abies sibirica). The role of the fungus in the disease complex is still unknown, and awaits further study. This thesis represents a comprehensive review of all known, as well as newly described species. It should greatly facilitate plant pathologists and mycologists in the identification of Leptographium spp. This should lead to extensive pathogenicity tests, to determine the economic impact of species in this genus as blue-stain fungi and pathogens. It is my sincere wish that it will renew interest in this group of fungi, and will lead to the description of many more species in this genus. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

White explained, [...] "Well, I think I really wanted this video to kind of be an evolution for Taylor [...] I actually said to her, 'I don't think we should shoot in a high school.' And I don't think she wanted to either." [...] White conceptualized the video's setting by taking into account the literal meaning of the song and transforming into something new. He conceptualized the setting to be new world where Swift could revisit her memories, as they manifest around her. [...] "Let's take the literal meaning of this song and watch it evolve in front of us ... almost as a memory in your head. And create this world, somewhere you walk in on this desolate desert and you start to sing about all these great memories you have... of everything you love blooming around you, and so we literally grew this garden around her", White said. [...] The world moved from one situation to the next. White decided to annex surreal elements to create a cross between a garden and the heart of the memories. He intertwined Swift's emotions with the growth of the garden.
