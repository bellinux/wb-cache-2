40|$|Stenosis of the {{subclavian artery}} {{proximal}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{origin of the}} internal mammary artery (IMA) used for coronary artery bypass grafting may produce flow reversal (steal syndrome) and cause myocardial ischemia. We present three cases of subclavian artery stenosis proximal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>IMA</b> before and after CABG. The first case developed symptomatic myocardial ischemia resulting from a variant of coronary-subclavian steal syndrome. The second case had asymptomatic subclavian artery stenosis proximal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>IMA</b> used for CABG. In the third case we planned to perform CABG using <b>the</b> left <b>IMA</b> <b>to</b> treat cardiac ischemia. All of the patients were successfully treated by stent placement {{without the use of}} a protection device. In the first and second cases, cardiac ischemia did not appear during balloon inflation of the subclavian artery and no embolic complication occurred. In the third case, CABG was performed six months after stenting. Subclavian artery stenting is a valid alternative to surgical treatment <b>to</b> restore <b>the</b> flow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>IMA</b> before or after CABG...|$|R

40|$|Internal mammary arteries (IMA) as {{conduits}} in {{coronary artery}} bypass grafting are superior to saphenous vein grafts. If there is subclavian artery stenosis (SAS) proximal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>IMA</b> graft, impairment of flow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>IMA</b> may occur. If the stenosis is severe, retrograde flow from the grafted coronary artery <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brachial artery may lead <b>to</b> angina. Following <b>the</b> identification of 2 cases of angina secondary to subclavian artery stenosis at their institution, the authors prospectively performed arch angiography in a cohort of patients with manifestations of periph-eral vascular disease undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography <b>to</b> assess <b>the</b> prevalence of subclavian stenosis. Fifty-two patients {{were enrolled in the}} protocol, with 48 patients having technically acceptable studies. Of these 48, 41. 6 % had measurable stenosis of {{at least one of the}} brachiocephalic arteries, with 35 % of patients with at least a 30 % stenosis of the left subclavian artery and 18. 7 % with more than 50 % stenosis. They conclude that patients with significant peripheral vascular disease undergoing coronary angiography who are potential candidates for revascularization may benefit from arch angiography as part of their initial evaluation...|$|R

The Niblack family had acquired it when Admiral Albert Parker Niblack, Eliza's brother, was stationed in Gibraltar in 1917. His discerning eye led to a collection of 2,500 Moroccan, European, and Indonesian textiles, all of which {{found their way into}} <b>the</b> <b>IMA's</b> collection. <b>The</b> family's generosity means the museum holds {{one of the most important}} collections of Moroccan textiles in the United States, since most institutions focus on Turkish and Persian textiles.|$|R

Another important exhibit <b>to</b> travel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>IMA</b> was Roman Art from the Louvre, which attracted 106,002 visitors during its 2008 run. The exhibition featured 184 mosaics, frescoes, statues, marble reliefs, and vessels loaned from the permanent collection of the Louvre in Paris, France.

40|$|Objective/BackgroundTo {{report on}} our {{experience}} of the treatment of aortic aneurysms by custom-made, branched stent-grafts with an additional inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) side branch to preserve IMA perfusion in patients at risk for colon ischemia. MethodsThree male patients (mean age 60 years) with a thoracoabdominal, pararenal, and infrarenal aortic aneurysm (AA), respectively, were treated by endovascular aneurysm exclusion using custom-made, branched stent-grafts with a side branch <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>IMA</b> for prevention of colon ischemia. Indications for selective IMA side branch perfusion were occlusions or high-grade stenosis of the visceral or hypogastric arteries. ResultsNo colon ischemia and no neurological deficit were observed. All three IMA side branches were perfused and patent, as documented by computed tomography scan and duplex ultrasound postoperatively and after 12 months. Patency after 24 months was documented as 2 / 3. ConclusionCustom-made, branched stent-grafts are an endovascular option <b>to</b> preserve <b>the</b> <b>IMA</b> perfusion in selected, electively treated patients with an increased risk for insufficient colon perfusion due to stenosis or occlusions of visceral or hypogastric arteries...|$|R
