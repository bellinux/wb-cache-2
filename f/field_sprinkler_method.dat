40|$|A four-season {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in the North China Plain (NCP) to evaluate crop yield and water productivity of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under sprinkler and surface irrigation. Results show that leaf area index (LAI) of winter wheat was greater and active leaf area lasted for longer in the sprinkler than in the surface irrigated field. Above-ground biomass at harvest was 4 similar to 22. 1 % greater in the sprinkler than in the surface irrigated field, similarly the yield was greater by 11. 5 similar to 50. 9 %. The greater yield was mainly due to the greater weight of 1000 kernels in the <b>sprinkler</b> irrigated <b>field.</b> Seasonal crop evapotranspiration (ET) was lower by 4 similar to 23 %, water productivity (WP) was higher by 18 similar to 57 % and irrigation water productivity (IWP) was higher by 21 similar to 81 % in the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>field</b> than in the surface irrigated field. Statistical analysis of four-season data by using a generalized linear model showed that the <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation <b>method</b> significantly increased crop yield, WP and IWP, and significantly decreased crop ET.

40|$|A {{potential}} {{scenario for}} retrieving saltcake from single shell tanks is the ''Rainbird{reg_sign} sprinkler'' method. Water is distributed evenly {{across the surface}} of the saltcake and allowed to percolate by gravity through the waste. The salt dissolves in the water, forming a saturated solution. The saturated liquid is removed by a saltwell pump situated near the bottom of the tank. By this method, there is never a large inventory of liquid in the tank that could pose a threat of leakage. There are many variables or factors that can influence the hydrodynamics of this retrieval process. They include saltcake porosity; saltwell pumping rate; salt dissolution chemistry; factors that could promote flow channeling (e. g. tank walls, dry wells, inclusions or discontinuities in the saltcake); method of water distribution; plug formation due to crystal formations or accumulation of insoluble solids. A brief literature search indicates that very little experimental data exist on these aspects of saltcake dissolution (Wiersma 1996, 1997).

40|$|Efficient use {{of water}} in {{irrigated}} agriculture is as important in areas of plentiful water supply {{as it is in}} water-short areas. Much of the water delivered to the farm for irrigation is lost while applying it to the land because of the system management practices followed. Field-water application efficiency is the precentage of water delivered to a field that is stored in the soil within the root zone of the growing crop. Factors affecting field-water application efficiency in irrigation are climate, soil, crop, water supply, topography, method of irrigation, irrigation system design, and irrigation system operation. Water is applied to the land by four general methods: flooding, furrows, sprinkler, and subirrigation. Each of these methods has charactersitic water losses, but all losses can be classified under evaporation, deep percolation, or runoff.

For pad-and-fan ventilation rates less than 0. 034 m 3 m- 2 s- 1, total greenhouse WUE (20 - 33 kg m- 3) was similar to field drip irrigation. For the temperature-controlled high-pressure-fog system, total greenhouse WUE (14 - 17 kg m- 3) was similar to <b>field</b> <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation. For the 6 -month crop cycle, combining water use by closed irrigation and pad-and-fan systems produced a total WUE of 15 kg m- 3. Pad-and-fan WUE increased during monsoon conditions due to lower water use rates. Evaporative cooling water use and air temperature were well-predicted by the energy balance model. Predictions of air temperature improved when outside climate the measured conditions at one greenhouse location. Wind tunnel and full-scale studies of natural ventilation demonstrated the value of knowing airflow patterns when designing and operating a high-pressure-fog systemIt is possible for greenhouse tomato production to have a higher WUE than field production, if ventilation rates are not excessive, if closed irrigation is used, and if control methodologies are improved. Water use can be minimized by knowing how the evaporative cooling system affects greenhouse climate and plant responses...|$|R
40|$|Studies of {{physiological}} parameters associated with crop performance and growth in {{different groups of}} upland rice (Oryza sativa L.) may support plant breeding programs. We evaluated the role of gas exchange rates and dry matter accumulation (DMA) as traits responsible for yields in a traditional (cv. &# 8216;Caiap&# 243;&# 8217;), intermediate (cv. &# 8216;Primavera&# 8217;) and modern (cv. &# 8216;Maravilha&# 8217;) upland rice cultivars. Leaf gas exchange rates, DMA, leaf area index (LAI), harvest indexes (HI) and yield components were measured on these genotypes in the <b>field,</b> under <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation. Panicles per m 2 and DMA at flowering (FL) and heading, as well as CO 2 assimilation rates (A) were similar across these cultivars. The highest yield was found in &# 8216;Primavera&# 8217;, which {{may be explained by}} (i) a two-fold higher HI compared to the other cultivars, (ii) greater rates of DMA during spikelet formation and grain-filling, as well as (iii) a slow natural decrease of A in this cultivar, {{at the end of the}} season (between FL and maturation) ...|$|R
40|$|Various studies {{conducted}} {{to process the}} vast solar energy is abundant in the world, especially in Indonesia, which is a tropical country. Now this {{is the use of}} solar panels was developed as an alternative source of electrical energy generation. Researchers {{are looking for ways to}} utilize solar panels as a tool that can ease and useful for society as garden sprinklers work automatically by considering the soil moisture. This research aims to design an automatic garden sprinklers solar power refers to soil moisture. In the automatic garden <b>sprinkler</b> <b>methods</b> of solar power does is to design a place to put solar panels at a height of 2 meters above the ground at an angle of 300, the installation of sprinklers in the area of the plant so that the plant can pour water thoroughly, and installation of soil moisture sensor in the ground at a distance of 1 meter in hopes sensor can work in accordance with the value of soil moisture. How to observations made related to data capture voltage and current generated by solar panels, water discharge, variations in water bursts and the length of time to supply water pumps. The equipment used for these measurements, among others: luxmeter, used to measure the intensity of light. Ammeters, used to measure DC current. Multitester, used for measuring voltage and AC current. Stopwatch, used to calculate long time. The results showed that, the aquarium water pump can be switched on and off automatically without human intermediaries, it is because the soil moisture sensor, if the sensor shows values above 700 then the Arduino Uno will be channeled towards the output power relay circuit that turns on the water pump. Conversely, if the humidity sensor indicates a value less than 700 then the Arduino Uno does not provide power to the relay output so that the source DC circuit the battery can not be transmitted to the water pump. Testing the water pump without the use of solar panels capable of changing the water pump tank for 25 minutes. This is because it is full of energy supplied by the battery (batteries). Meanwhile, when the use of solar panels for the highest intensity obtained when this study is 102, 000 lux, able to turn the water pump tank for 55 minutes. Aquarium water pump can operate longer with a distance of 30 minutes compared to using solar panels...|$|R
5000|$|Sprinklers {{can also}} be mounted on moving {{platforms}} connected to the water source by a hose. Automatically moving wheeled systems known as traveling sprinklers may irrigate areas such as small farms, sports fields, parks, pastures, and cemeteries unattended. Most of these utilize a length of polyethylene tubing wound on a steel drum. As the tubing is wound on the drum powered by the irrigation water or a small gas engine, the sprinkler is pulled across the <b>field.</b> When the <b>sprinkler</b> arrives back at the reel the system shuts off. This type of system is known to most people as a [...] "waterreel" [...] traveling irrigation sprinkler and they are used extensively for dust suppression, irrigation, and land application of waste water.|$|R
