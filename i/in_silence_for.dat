5|$|During this time, Overton {{was known}} to sit in his bases' chapel <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> {{extended}} periods of time, not praying, to calm his nerves. He also began to grow a mustache, though he professes not to be superstitious. Overton would continue to grow this mustache until immediately before his final flight, when he shaved it off. He also believed any number with a three in it, including the number 13, was lucky.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after being}} hired {{he was taken}} aside by the news {{producer}} and asked to read the on-air bulletin for the nightly broadcast. He read the news for three months until one night when he condensed a six-minute bulletin into three minutes. He attributed this to stage fright, which caused him to speak too fast. The rest of the production crew were not {{ready to move on}} to the next news items, leaving Harries standing <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> several minutes. Harries recalled in a 2007 interview that Steve Morrison, the producer of the bulletin, called him into his office and berated him, telling him he did not deserve to be on television and that he would no longer be reading the news. Morrison's remarks angered Harries to such a point that he assaulted the man. Aware that he was going to lose his job, he contacted a Granada colleague who got him a new job at Granada's London centre, which he took up at the age of 23.|$|E

25|$|On {{the next}} day, the players wore black armbands. Before {{the start of}} play, the teams {{assembled}} in the ground. The players and the crowd stood bareheaded and <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> two minutes before the match resumed at 11:30. Five Durham cricketers acted as his pall-bearers. At the inquest his death was put down to heart disease, following double pneumonia two years earlier. A post-mortem examination disclosed an abnormally large heart that the doctor said made it almost unbelievable that Nichol lived such a long active life. Nichol was {{engaged to be married}} to Dorothy Ayers.|$|E
25|$|On 26 March, in {{an event}} {{organised}} by Women's March on London, roughly 100 women, including many Muslims, joined hands {{to form a}} chain along Westminster Bridge and stood <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> five minutes {{to pay tribute to}} the victims of the attack. Amber Rudd appeared on BBC's The Andrew Marr Show to call for government backdoor access to encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp, which Masood used to send a message shortly before the attack. She announced a meeting with similar technology industry leaders for 30 March, where she would persuade them to voluntarily co-operate with the government. She refused to rule out passing new legislation to this end if the companies do not comply.|$|E
500|$|On May 18 of {{the same}} year, Alexander Berkman was {{released}} from prison. Carrying a bouquet of roses, Goldman met him on the train platform and found herself [...] "seized by terror and pity" [...] as she beheld his gaunt, pale form. Neither was able to speak; they returned to her home <b>in</b> <b>silence.</b> <b>For</b> weeks, he struggled to readjust to life on the outside; an abortive speaking tour ended in failure, and in Cleveland he purchased a revolver {{with the intent of}} killing himself. [...] He returned to New York, however, and learned that Goldman had been arrested with a group of activists meeting to reflect on Czolgosz. Invigorated anew by this violation of freedom of assembly, he declared, [...] "My resurrection has come!" [...] and set about securing their release.|$|E
50|$|These methods {{defeat the}} purpose of {{intentional}} spacing between tracks. Not all albums are mix albums; perhaps more typically, there is an aesthetic pause between unrelated tracks.

500|$|... "Cry" [...] was {{promoted}} by a music video, or [...] "short film," [...] as Jackson would refer to it. The video {{was directed by}} Nicholas Brandt, who had previously directed [...] "Earth Song" [...] (1995), [...] "Childhood" [...] (1995) and [...] "Stranger in Moscow" [...] (1996), {{all of which were}} featured on Jackson's [...] album. The video was filmed in six different locations, all were filmed in California. People featured in the video included members of a real life gospel group. The video begins with dozens of people of different ages, ethnicities and races holding hands. Long lines of people were stretched over mountains, across highways, in a forest and on the beach. Everyone stands <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> a majority of the video. Following the bridge, everyone begins singing the chorus. Towards the final chorus, the group collectively clap their hands along with the song, taking hands once more as the song ends.|$|E
500|$|In April 2000, filming {{began on}} the Michael Bay film Pearl Harbor. [...] Before the filming, {{the cast and crew}} {{gathered}} on the USS Arizona memorial for a wreath-laying by a representative of Touchstone Pictures, Jerry Bruckheimer and Bay. The producers brought fifteen vintage planes to Ford Island, placing them in one hangar for the filming. In addition, they brought fifteen ships back to Pearl Harbor for live bombardment (without sinking them). [...] The operations room of the control tower was converted into a barracks for the filming. The Pacific Aviation Museum hoped that the film would increase public awareness of the tower and spur support for its restoration. Bay reflected on the historic significance of Ford Island: [...] "I have a vivid memory of showing the crew around Ford Island during pre-production. We came upon a plaque directly across from the sunken Arizona, marking the spot where a torpedo hit nearly six decades ago. My crew stood <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> three minutes at the sight of this small monument. It was a solemn moment for all of us, and I think it helped the crew appreciate the undertaking were [...] about to begin." [...] During filming, a Vultee BT-13 Valiant used as a torpedo bomber crashed on the island.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} Sherlock Holmes story, A Study in Scarlet (1887), Doctor Watson compares Holmes to Dupin, to which Holmes replies: [...] "No doubt {{you think you}} are complimenting me ... In my opinion, Dupin was a very {{inferior}} fellow... He had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appears to imagine". Alluding to an episode in [...] "The Murders in the Rue Morgue", where Dupin deduces what his friend is thinking despite their having walked together <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> a quarter of an hour, [...] Holmes remarks: [...] "That trick of his breaking in on his friend's thoughts with an apropos remark... is really very showy and superficial"; nevertheless, Holmes later performs the same 'trick' on Watson in [...] "The Adventure of the Cardboard Box".|$|E
2500|$|After George Balanchine {{was hired}} by the Ballet Russe, he was {{attracted}} to Tallchief professionally and personally. She, however, was unaware of his attraction: [...] "It {{never occurred to me that}} there was anything more than dancing on his mind... It would have been preposterous to think there was anything personal." [...] Although their relationship became more personal, it was a shock to Tallchief when Balanchine asked her to marry him. During the summer of 1945, he asked her to meet him after a Los Angeles performance. Balanchine opened the car door for her; when she got in he sat <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> a moment before saying, [...] "Maria, I would like you to become my wife". [...] "I almost fell out of my seat and was unable to respond", she recalled. [...] She eventually replied, [...] "But, George, I'm not sure I love you. I feel that I hardly know you." [...] He answered that it did not matter, and if the marriage only lasted a few years that was all right with him. After a day to think it over, Tallchief accepted his proposal.|$|E
2500|$|One Friday {{evening in}} March, 1980, Bonin offered a 17-year-old named William Ray Pugh {{a ride home}} as the pair left the house of Everett Fraser. Within minutes of {{accepting}} the ride, Bonin asked Pugh whether {{he would like to}} engage in sex with him. Pugh later stated he panicked and stuttered upon hearing this question and, after sitting <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> several minutes, attempted to leave the vehicle once Bonin had slowed the van at a stoplight. In response, Bonin wordlessly leaned across and grabbed Pugh by the collar, dragging him back into the passenger seat. According to Pugh, Bonin then confided in him that he enjoyed abducting young male hitchhikers on Friday and Saturday nights, whom he then restrained and abused before strangling them to death with their own T-shirts. In a matter-of-fact tone, Bonin then informed Pugh: [...] "If you want to kill somebody, you should make a plan and find a place to dump the body before you even pick a victim." [...] Bonin then informed Pugh he had not chosen to refrain from assaulting and killing him out of sentiment; he'd been spared because the pair had been seen leaving Fraser's party together.|$|E

2500|$|The concert {{opens and}} closes {{with a giant}} storybook {{containing}} a massive LED video screen, among the first technology of its kind at the time. The book opens, revealing a frontispiece consisting of stars and planets before its covers split, floating backward and lit up into dual video screens. Jackson emerges between the screens in a top hat and velvet suit, resembling a [...] "19th century British merchant", along with eight dancers to perform opening number [...] "Velvet Rope", using a refrain of The Exorcist theme. After transitioning into [...] "If", Jackson stares at the audience <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> several minutes to cheering and applause before performing [...] "You." [...] Jackson is backed by dancers strutting alongside her wearing dual-sided masks, representing an isolated persona. Jackson then takes to a center stage stool to perform unplugged versions of [...] "Let's Wait Awhile" [...] and [...] "Again" [...] with an acoustic guitarist. A [...] "frenzied" [...] medley of hits from Control succeeds the ballads, including [...] "Control", [...] "The Pleasure Principle", [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", and [...] "Nasty", as well as janet.'s erotic house number [...] "Throb." [...] The red velvet curtain closes the stage while a [...] "hidden light-and sound show" [...] likened to extraterrestrial film Close Encounters entertains the crowd during set changes. The stage reveals the [...] "deranged madness" [...] of the following [...] "hallucinatory" [...] segment, featuring Jackson in a jester's headdress and satin bustier, with dancers dressed as [...] "flowers, Mad Hatters, and horny gnomes" [...] in a [...] "Wonderland" [...] setting. Jackson performs an upbeat medley of [...] "Escapade", [...] "When I Think of You", [...] "Miss You Much", [...] "Runaway", and [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)" [...] across a [...] "blindingly bright, poppy-induced set design" [...] with varied props, which include a smiling clock tower, inflatable moons, mammoth chaise, vases, and books.|$|E
2500|$|Unprogrammed worship (also {{known as}} waiting worship, [...] "silent worship", or holy communion {{in the manner}} of Friends) is based on the {{practices}} of George Fox and the Early Friends, who based their religious beliefs and practices on their interpretation of how the early Christians worshipped God their Heavenly Father. Friends gather together in [...] "expectant waiting upon God" [...] to experience his still small voice leading them from within. There is no plan on how the meeting will proceed, and actual practice varies widely between Meetings and individual worship services. Friends believe that God plans what will happen, with his spirit leading people to speak. When a participant feels led to speak, he or she will stand and share a spoken message of ("vocal ministry") in front of others. When this happens, Quakers believe that the spirit of God is speaking through the speaker. After someone has spoken, it is customary to allow a few minutes pass <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> reflection on what has been said, before further vocal ministry is given. Sometimes a meeting is entirely silent, sometimes many speak. These meetings lasted for several hours in George Fox's day. Modern meetings are often limited to an hour, ending when two people (usually the elders) exchange the sign of peace by handshake. This handshake is often shared by the others. This style of worship is the norm in Great Britain, Ireland, the continent of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Southern Africa, Canada, and parts of the United States (particularly yearly meetings associated with Friends General Conference and Beanite Quakerism)—constituting about 11% of Quakers. Those who worship in this style hold each person to be equal before God and capable of knowing the light of God directly. Anyone present may speak if they feel led to do so. Traditionally, Recorded Ministers were recognised for their particular gift in vocal ministry. This religious practice continues among Conservative Friends and Liberal Friends (e.g. New York Yearly Meeting). Many meetings where Liberal Friends predominate abolished this religious practice. London Yearly Meeting of Friends abolished the acknowledging and recording of Recorded Ministers in 1924.|$|E
