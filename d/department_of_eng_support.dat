40|$|The {{problem of}} {{estimating}} continuous [...] time stochastic models from discrete [...] time data is addressed. The presented approach {{is based on}} discrete [...] time models parametrized with the continuous [...] time parameters using discrete [...] time approximations of the derivative operator. It is shown that the parameters in these models, in general, cannot be estimated with the standard least squares method (this in contrast to deterministic models). Instead an instrumental variable method is suggested and analyzed. The approach is numerically illustrated for both uniformly and nonuniformly sampled data.

40|$|We {{describe}} a parallelizable block-cipher {{mode of operation}} that simultaneously provides privacy and authenticity. OCB encrypts-and-authenticates a nonempty string M # { 0, 1 } # using #|M |/n# + 2 block-cipher invocations, where n is the block length of the underlying block cipher. Additional overhead is small. OCB refines a scheme, IAPM, suggested by Jutla [20]. Desirable properties of OCB include: the ability to encrypt a bit string of arbitrary length into a ciphertext of minimal length; cheap o#set calculations; cheap session setup, a single underlying cryptographic key; no extended-precision addition; a nearly optimal number of block-cipher calls; and no requirement for a random IV. We prove OCB secure, quantifying the adversary's ability to violate privacy or authenticity {{in terms of the}} quality of the block cipher as a pseudorandom permutation (PRP) or as a strong PRP, respectively.

40|$|Endoglin (ENG) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a candidate tumor-suppressor gene in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Earlier microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT) studies of chromosome 9 in ESCC narrowed down a tumor-suppressive critical region to 9 q 33 - 34. ENG maps to 9 q 34 -qter and encodes a transformation growth factor beta (TGFb) superfamily auxiliary receptor. This study aims to identify the potential role for ENG in ESCC development. Significant downregulation <b>of</b> <b>ENG</b> was detected at frequencies of 87. 5 % in 16 ESCC cell lines, 39. 1 % directly in 23 ESCC tumor specimens from Hong Kong, and 33. 4 % in 18 ESCC tumor specimens from the high-risk ESCC region of Henan, China. By methylation-specific PCR, methylated sequences were detected in an ESCC cell line panel and in clinical specimens. Following demethylation treatment in 9 ESCC cell lines, ENG expression was obviously restored. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in a 4. 7 Mb region on 9 q 32 -q 34, where ENG maps, was observed directly in ESCC tumor tissues. Both epigenetic methylation and allelic loss appear to contribute to ENG downregulation in tumor cells. In vitro and in vivo functional studies such as colony formation, Matrigel culture, invasion and tumorigenicity assays were performed. Colony formation efficiency was significantly reduced by overexpression <b>of</b> <b>ENG.</b> In addition, significantly smaller colonies <b>of</b> <b>ENG</b> stable transfectants were formed in Matrigel culture. Significant suppression of invasion efficiency and tumorigenicity were also observed, when comparing the ENG stable transfectants with the vector-alone transfectants.

40|$|Many {{academic}} libraries {{partner with}} English composition {{in order to}} teach first year students skills related to academic research and writing.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the impact of two factors on student information literacy skill development: library instruction and section theme—defined here as class sections of the English 102 (ENG 102) program developed around a central topic selected by the instructor. A random sample of annotated bibliographies from 95 sections <b>of</b> <b>ENG</b> 102 were scored with two information literacy rubrics in order to find out if scores differed between sections based on the variables of library instruction and theme. The results of this study indicate that sections <b>of</b> the <b>ENG</b> 102 program that attended an information literacy instruction session scored significantly higher on the annotated bibliography assignment than sections that did not attend. We also found that themed sections <b>of</b> <b>ENG</b> 102 scored marginally higher on the annotated bibliography than non-themed sections <b>of</b> <b>ENG</b> 102.
