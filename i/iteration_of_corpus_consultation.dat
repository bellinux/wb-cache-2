40|$|Alongside {{developments}} in language research, the potential <b>of</b> <b>corpora</b> {{as a resource}} in language learning and teaching has been evident to researchers and teachers since the late 1960 s. Despite publications which emphasise the benefits <b>of</b> <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> for language learners (Bernardini, 2002; Kennedy & Miceli, 2001), {{there is little evidence}} to suggest that direct <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> is coming {{to be seen as a}} complement or alternative to consultation of a dictionary, course book, or grammar by the majority of learners. There is thus a need for research to underpin the integration <b>of</b> <b>corpora</b> and concordancing in the language-learning environment. This study begins with an account of published research relating to course design and structure in the area <b>of</b> <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> by language learners. The focus then narrows to the initial training <b>of</b> learners in <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation,</b> using as an example a course involving undergraduate students on several language degree programmes. The results of the students 2 ̆ 7 <b>consultation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>corpora</b> are examined, including choice of search word(s), analytical skills, the problems encountered, and their evaluation of the activity.

40|$|Although many {{researchers}} {{have shown the}} positive effects of teacher feedback on second language (L 2) writing, it is still unclear to what extent L 2 learners are able to self-correct their errors accurately in their revisions responding to indirect teacher feedback. Likewise, potential application <b>of</b> electronic <b>corpora</b> that improves L 2 writers 2 ̆ 7 writing skills has been explored over the past decade. However, there are only few empirical studies examining the effect <b>of</b> <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> by L 2 learners on improved learning outcomes. ^ The present study investigated the role that <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> plays in the correction of errors via four types of indirect feedback (uncoded indirect feedback only, coded indirect feedback only, uncoded indirect feedback with <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation,</b> and coded indirect feedback with <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation)</b> for lower level Japanese as Foreign Language (JFL) learners. It also examined whether the use of concordance program enhanced accuracy in writing, and whether any effects of indirect feedback with <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> could be retained over a long-term period. Additionally, their perceptions and attitudes toward the <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> were investigated. ^ The results indicated that, in terms of accuracy gain, uncoded/coded indirect feedback with the <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> led to more accurate error correction than uncoded indirect feedback only. Likewise, from the short-term perspective, uncoded feedback with the <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> was significantly more effective than uncoded/coded indirect feedback only. As to long-term effect, however, <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> had a significant positive effect when uncoded indirect feedback was provided on the students 2 ̆ 7 writings. Overall, the JFL learners expressed positive attitudes toward the use <b>of</b> <b>corpus</b> and agreed that it was beneficial to improve their writing skills.

40|$|In {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} environment of language learning and teaching, electronic literacies have {{an increasingly important}} role to play. While much research on new literacies focuses on the World Wide Web, the aim {{in this study is}} to investigate the importance <b>of</b> <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> as a new type of literacy which is of particular relevance in the context of language learning and teaching. After briefly situating the theoretical and pedagogical context of the study in relation to authenticity and learner autonomy, the paper describes an empirical study involving eight postgraduate students of French. As part of a Masters course they write a short text and subsequently attempt to improve it by using concordancing software to consult a small corpus containing texts on a similar subject. The analysis of the results reveals a significant number of changes made by the learners which may be classified as follows in order of frequency: grammatical errors (gender and agreement, prepositions, verb forms/mood, negation and syntax); misspellings, accents and hyphens; lexico- grammatical patterning (native language interference, choice of verb and inappropriate vocabulary); and capitalisation. The conclusion notes that the situation in which these students found themselves (i. e. faced with a text on which the teacher had indicated phrases which could be improved) is replicated in many cases every day, and suggests that <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> may have a useful role to play in the context of interactive feedback, particularly in cases where traditional language learning resources are of little use.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> on the {{accuracy}} of learner written error revisions. It examines the conditions which cause a learner to consult the corpus in correcting errors and whether these revisions are more effective than those made using other corrections methods. Claims have been made for the potential usefulness <b>of</b> <b>corpora</b> in encouraging {{a better understanding of}} language through inductive learning (Johns, 1991; Benson, 2001; Watson Todd, 2003). The opportunity for learners to interact with the authentic language used to compile corpora has also been cited as a possible benefit (Thurstun and Candlin, 1998). However, theoretical advantages <b>of</b> using <b>corpus</b> data have not always translated into actual benefits in real learning contexts. Learners frequently encounter difficulties in dealing with the volume of information available to them in concordances and can reject corpus use because it adds to their learning load (Yoon and Hirvela, 2004; Frankenberg Garcia, 2005; Lee and Swales, 2006). This has meant that practical employment <b>of</b> <b>corpus</b> data has sometimes been difficult to implement. In this experiment, learners on a six week pre-sessional English for Academic Purposes (EAP) course were shown how to use the BYU (Brigham Young University) website to access the BNC (British National Corpus) to address written errors. Through a draft/feedback/revision process using meta-linguistic error coding, the frequency, context and effectiveness <b>of</b> the <b>corpus</b> being used as a reference tool was measured. Use <b>of</b> the <b>corpus</b> was found to be limited to a small range of error types which largely involved queries of a pragmatic nature. In these contexts, the corpus was found to be a potentially more effective correction tool than dictionary reference or recourse to previous knowledge and it may have a beneficial effect in encouraging top-down processing skills. However, its frequency of use over the course was low and accounted for only a small proportion of accurate error revisions as a whole. Learner response to the corpus corroborated the negative perception already noted in previous studies. These findings prompt recommendations for further investigation into effective mediation <b>of</b> <b>corpus</b> data within the classroom and continued technological developments in order to make corpus data more accessible to non-specialists...|$|R
40|$|Collaborative {{learning}} has been increasingly incorporated into learners' <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> {{as a type}} of pedagogic mediation. However, studies found that collaborative {{learning has}} negative aspects as it may cause conflicts and power inequality among members. Given the two sides of collaboration, this study provides a critical investigation on the functions of collaboration in learners' <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation.</b> Through two collaborative corpus analysis sessions, three students of different L 2 proficiency levels assisted each other’s understanding <b>of</b> <b>corpus</b> data to complete group activities. The students’ verbal and nonverbal behaviors during corpus analysis became the main source of investigation, complemented by the results of pre-/post-interviews and the researcher's direct observations. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} collaboration creates significant power inequality among the participants by gradually marginalizing the less capable student in the group from the learning process and increasing the psychological burden for the most capable student. In addition, collaborative work during <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> could impede critical learning opportunities for individual students to pursue personal queries during collaboration. Despite some limitations, the findings of this study provide a realistic picture of collaboration in learners’ <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> and suggest pedagogical implications to corpus-based instruction...|$|R
30|$|Complexity {{is another}} {{significant}} aspect that can reveal a learner’s writing competence, {{thus it is}} also measured in case that some learners are reluctant to try to produce more complex words or sentences for fear of making errors. The results reveal that the group adopting a DDL approach didn’t make obvious improvement in both of the vocabulary complexity and grammatical complexity. Furthermore, according to some interviewees, Baidu seems to help them better in improving writing complexity since students can usually {{get a lot of}} relevant complex sentences or even excellent essays just by simply typing in the topic of the essay in Baidu in the process of revising essays. However, they often have to do complex query in BNCweb for getting the desirable sentences. In reality, many students just use the simple query function by simply typing in some phrases, but rarely use POS tags offered to them while consulting corpora. This is consistent with Pérez-Paredes et al.’s (2012) discovery that learners just used BNC as if they were using Google without using POS tags or regular expressions. Therefore, the lack <b>of</b> <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> skills is an important factor that may influence learners’ improvement in complexity. Just as stated by Sabti and Chaichan’s (2014) that computer skill is the biggest barrier that impedes the use of computer technologies in language learning. Thus more training or instruction about consultation skills should be provided to students. With good consultation skills, students will exploit corpora better thus they may easily get the complex sentence structure that they want from BNCweb while revising sentences. Then in the writing test {{they may be able to}} produce complex sentences. In addition, it usually takes a rather long time for one to significantly improve one’s productive use of vocabulary and grammatical knowledge. Thus it is suggested that teachers continue the DDL activities in writing for a longer time period, and then evaluate their writing complexity again. Moreover, EFL learners should be encouraged to take risks to produce more complex words or structures and not to be afraid of making errors in regular writing assignments. In the process of dealing with complex expressions or structures, their language proficiency will be improved, which may result in their better performance in complexity in writing test.|$|R

40|$|Corpus {{linguistics}} {{has contributed}} considerably to the arsenal of tools available for language description, with methodologies applicable to virtually any area of language study. Yet like most academic disciplines, corpus linguistics is generally limited to researchers and other professionals; {{in the fields}} of foreign/second language teaching and learning, this involves considerable mediation upstream before the results filter down to the end users - teachers and learners. An alternative would be for corpus data to feature directly in the learning process, with learners acting as "researchers" to explore the language themselves. This is commonly referred to as "data-driven learning" (DDL), an idea particularly associated with the seminal collection of papers edited by Johns and King (1991). The last 20 years has seen substantial research interest in DDL, with countless scholarly articles arguing its various merits, though it is frequently remarked that empirical research is disturbingly lacking. However, Boulton (forthcoming) lists over 70 studies which seek to evaluate some aspect <b>of</b> L 2 <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation.</b> This suggests that the research exists, but is fragmented and lacking in visibility and accessibility to a wider community. The aim of the present paper is to bring together the DDL research in ESP, where Gavioli (2005) argues convincingly that the learners represent a major population who stand to gain from DDL. An overview is presented <b>of</b> the tools, <b>corpora,</b> methodologies and research questions covered in 20 empirical DDL studies for ESP. The overwhelming majority show that learners are able to work with corpora in many contexts and for many purposes, and respond positively to the approach. In terms of learning outcomes, the results are generally promising, though not perhaps as conclusive as one might hope. Reasons for this are discussed, but it is argued that there are grounds for cautious optimism regarding corpus use in ESP {{in a wide variety of}} contexts...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{studies the}} {{activity}} of lay interpreters (LI) in bilingual (Yucatec Maya and Spanish) medical consultations. It focuses in particular on the interpreter’s correction of responses that patients give to doctors. The occurrence of such correcting sequences reveals some trouble in the patient’s response to questions in Spanish, or in understanding the LI’s translation of the prior question. It also reveals the LI’s understanding of the doctor’s questions, as well as her/his orientation towards {{the production of the}} appropriate in- formation needed to match such questions. Central in this study are cases in which the doctor seeks to quantify an undetermined value (related to time, intensity, frequency of a symptom or trouble). The analysis shows that the LIs intervene recurrently to specify the patients’ response to this type of question, pursuing a deﬁnite and translatable quantita-tive ﬁgure that could be delivered to the physician. Such practice also allows us to have ac-cess to the LIs’ local understanding of their speciﬁc role in the current activity.

40|$|Much {{discussion}} in language {{learning and teaching}} revolves around two main questions: what to learn and how to learn it. Corpus linguistics has {{had a significant impact}} on the former, as publishers use the findings to inform the language content of their syllabuses. On the other hand, and despite significant output in terms of research articles and publications, few teachers and still fewer learners have had any direct contact with language corpora per se. For such awareness to filter down to the end users, the major players upstream (publishers, software developers, politicians, schools, teacher trainers, etc.) have to be convinced that corpora have something to offer. While well-developed theoretical arguments show the potential is considerable, empirical evidence is surprisingly lacking (Chambers 2007). This paper looks at nearly 50 studies which provide some form of evaluation of the use <b>of</b> <b>corpora</b> in language learning. Many are essentially qualitative, bringing useful insights but remaining by definition rather subjective; quantitative evidence, however, remains scarce. Furthermore, the focus is often on learners' and teachers' attitudes to the use <b>of</b> <b>corpora,</b> or on their ability to use corpus techniques, rather than on the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>corpus</b> use. Finally, the remaining studies tend to divide into two main categories: those which are concerned with the use <b>of</b> <b>corpora</b> as a reference tool, especially in written production (including error-correction) and translation; and those few which actually look at whether corpora contribute to language learning itself – “data-driven learning”, to use Johns' term (e. g. 1991). This paper synthesises the research findings to date on all these questions, and argues that there is an urgent need for considerably more empirical evaluation of data-driven language learning, taking into account the large number of variables involved. Only then can we expect to see such techniques become part of mainstream language teaching and learning practices. Chambers, A. 2007.

Nonetheless, the multiple affordances <b>of</b> a <b>corpus</b> approach provide reason to think the investment might have larger pay-offs than often realised: familiarity with corpora can be applied across sub-disciplines in many if not all courses in a typical university degree in language. Further, learners can start using corpora productively even with minimal training in distance education, quickly going beyond simple concordancing. The students in this study are enrolled in a translation course in the third year of a degree in English at a French distance education centre. While corpora are widely used in translation teaching, this often involves the compilation <b>of</b> specific parallel <b>corpora</b> by the students. In this course, students have no prior experience <b>of</b> <b>corpus</b> use and are expected only to work only with freely available on-line monolingual <b>corpora</b> <b>of</b> contemporary English, thus enabling them to work immediately. The simple interface provided by Mark Davies ([URL] to large <b>corpora</b> <b>of</b> British (100 million words) and American (400 million words) English is widely used for such purposes, with over two thirds of all users declaring their primary interest as language learning, teaching or translation. The sites are easy for novice users to navigate and are accompanied by tutorials and help features: this is highly desirable in the distance teaching context where face-to-face input is not an option, and means that the course itself can keep the introduction to the basic concepts and techniques to a minimum. After that, the constraints of the distance context play to the strengths of constructivism as the students explore the corpora on their own; though email contact with the teacher is possible, and there are discussion forums to facilitate peer-to-peer collaboration, these are generally under-used.

These data are backed up by questionnaires submitted after each exam session to gain feedback from both successful and less successful students.

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{number of studies have}} looked at the value of corpus-based data-driven learning (DDL) for second language (L 2) written error correction, with generally positive results. However, a potential conundrum for language teachers involved in the process is how to provide feedback on students’ written production for DDL. The study looks at DDL-mediated error correction across 61 written samples submitted by 32 tertiary students during a series of short DDL courses. Teachers provided feedback on errors present in the samples, and students highlighted corrections made with or without the corpus. The results suggest that students used corpora to correct errors of word choice, word form, collocations and phrasing, but were less likely to use corpora to correct errors of deletion or morphosyntax. When the corpus was used, students were likely to successfully correct errors of collocation but were less successful for errors of morphosyntax. Post-course questionnaires suggested that perception of the usefulness of DDL for grammar learning was less than that for vocabulary and the learning of phrases, and that time and effort spent on analyzing concordance data and understanding the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s feedback on their writing were perceived as difficulties. To explore these findings further, a qualitative analysis of the feedback teachers provided suggests significant difficulties devising appropriate feedback that promotes autonomous, inductive language acquisition for all error types on the one hand, {{and at the same time}} does not eliminate the need for <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> nor is too vague for students to formulate appropriate corpus queries.

They are useful to construct a simple algorithm to find the continuous <b>iteration</b> <b>of</b> various functions and to deduce trivially, from the already known <b>iteration</b> <b>of</b> a function, the continuous <b>iteration</b> <b>of</b> a whole family of functions. It is pointed out how one can find <b>iterations</b> <b>of</b> functions which do not satisfy the perturbative boundary condition. The algorithm has been implemented in REDUCE and several examples are discussed...|$|R
