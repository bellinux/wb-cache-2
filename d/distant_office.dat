5|$|After Diocletian's {{reform of}} the provinces, {{governors}} were called iudex, or judge. The governor became responsible for his decisions first to his immediate superiors, {{as well as to}} the more <b>distant</b> <b>office</b> of the emperor. It was most likely at this time that judicial records became verbatim accounts of what was said in trial, making it easier to determine bias or improper conduct on the part of the governor. With these records and the Empire's universal right of appeal, Imperial authorities probably had a great deal of power to enforce behavior standards for their judges. In spite of Diocletian's attempts at reform, the provincial restructuring was far from clear, especially when citizens appealed the decisions of their governors. Proconsuls, for example, were often both judges of first instance and appeal, and the governors of some provinces took appellant cases from their neighbors. It soon became impossible to avoid taking some cases to the emperor for arbitration and judgment. Diocletian's reign marks the end of the classical period of Roman law. Where Diocletian's system of rescripts shows an adherence to classical tradition, Constantine's law is full of Greek and eastern influences.|$|E
50|$|Ferrods were {{mounted in}} pairs, usually with {{different}} control windings, so one could supervise a switchward {{side of a}} trunk and the other the <b>distant</b> <b>office.</b> Components inside the trunk pack, including diodes, determined for example, whether it performed reverse battery signaling as an incoming trunk, or detected reverse battery from a distant trunk; i.e. was an outgoing trunk.|$|E
50|$|In several cases, overlay {{plans were}} {{implemented}} {{on a special}} case basis to implement specialised dialing plans. In some areas, a party in one area code could dial an office prefix which was local, but in a different area code, with only 7 digits. If they were calling a <b>distant</b> <b>office</b> prefix {{in the same area}} code, they would either have to dial 1 and the number or 1+area code+number.|$|E

30|$|The {{leaders of}} the {{integrated}} development project described herein are an ecologist and conservation biologist (Foggin) and a consultant paediatrician with speciality in community child health (Torrance-Foggin). The project provided the basic context in which more community-oriented approaches to the provisioning of social services and environmental protection in pastoral environments were trialled, {{in contrast to the}} more top-down, blueprint approaches oft developed in <b>distant</b> <b>offices.</b>|$|R
50|$|Other test {{equipment}} includes a line insulation tester and an automatic trunk tester, for items whose numerosity and simplicity lent themselves to automatic testing. An automated AMA translator tester checked for miswiring that could bill one line to another. A nonautomated outgoing trunk test panel allows voltmeter checks on trunks to <b>distant</b> <b>offices,</b> freeing the MTF from this tedious job. Each outgoing trunk {{is represented by}} two jacks: one for test access for the voltmeter {{and one for the}} make-busy operation. MTF was able to override Make Busy when necessary.|$|R

Much to his sad dismay, his mother is immensely enjoying it and shown to have absolutely no remorse about cheating on her husband. It then flashes forward to the present day, and Yusuke's father has been transferred to a <b>distant</b> <b>office.</b> Before he left, he married a new wife on paper but not in ceremony; Yusuke now lives only with his stepmother Misako and her daughter Shiina from a previous marriage.|$|E
5000|$|In special cases, calls {{through a}} tandem office also used PCI signaling. This {{originated}} with manual operator tandems, {{and was later}} carried on to machine-based tandems as well. For this special tandem class, all seven dialed digits {{were sent to the}} <b>distant</b> <b>office.</b> In the case of a manual tandem, operators had a special seven segment display which displayed the entire telephone number. In later mechanical tandems, PCI was used because it was a faster than revertive pulse signaling, and would thus allow for quicker call completion times.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} PSTN lines it {{does not}} have a telephone number, each side of the line being permanently connected and dedicated to the other. Leased lines can be used for telephone, Internet, or other data services. Some are ringdown services, and some connect to a private branch exchange or router. Typically, leased lines are used by businesses to connect geographically <b>distant</b> <b>offices.</b> Unlike dial-up connections, a leased line is always active. The fee for the connection is a fixed monthly rate. The primary factors affecting the monthly fee are distance between end points and the speed of the circuit. Because the connection does not carry anybody else's communications, the carrier can assure a given level of quality.|$|R
25|$|The {{incoming}} {{section of}} the office, being fixed {{to the structure of}} the last four digits of the telephone number, had a limit of 10,000 phone numbers. In some of the urban areas where Panel was used, even a single square mile might have three or five times that many. Thus the incoming selectors of several separate switching entities shared floor space and staff, but required separate incoming trunk groups from <b>distant</b> <b>offices.</b> Sometimes an Office Select Tandem was used to distribute incoming traffic among the offices. This was a Panel office with no senders or other common control equipment; just one stage of selectors and accepting only the Office Brush and Office Group parameters. Panel Sender Tandems were also used when their greater capabilities were worth their additional cost.|$|R

40|$|By classic methodology, {{designing}} footwear is a {{very complex}} and laborious activity. That is because classic methodology requires many graphic executions using manual means, which consume lot of the producer's time. Moreover, the results of this classical methodology may contain many inaccuracies with the most unpleasant consequences for the footwear producer. The decisive step in this way has been made some time ago, when, as a result of powerful technical development and massive implementation of electronic calculus systems and informatics, CAD (Computer Assisted Design). This paper presents how the CRISPIN Dynamics Engineer can be used in designing of footwear products. This is a part of application CRISPIN Dynamics CAD Suite. It is a range of quality software products to give you the shoemaker a major advantage in shoe making. With CRISPIN Dynamics you can visualize a range of designs on-screen, work out the costs of a new style and even cut out sample shoe components. Reliance on manual skills are largely eliminated, so your staff can work creatively, but with increased accuracy and productivity. You can even send designs to a <b>distant</b> <b>office</b> or manufacturing centre in a matter of minutes. The Engineer program is broken into a series of 'tasks'. Each 'task' has a 'tool tray' that contains a number of separate functions to achieve the task. This are:- Drawing Menu is used for digitize the flattened half shell and develop into a full shell- Grade Menu is used for grading main shell - Assess Menu is used to develop various template placement and estimate resources consumption...|$|E

The system was implemented in the USA beginning in 1946 and was gradually superseded by Direct Distance Dialing (DDD) by 1965.|$|R
50|$|Much {{support for}} the {{introduction}} of a nationwide rural mail delivery service came from The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, the nation's oldest agricultural organization. Formerly, residents of rural areas had to either travel to a <b>distant</b> Post <b>office</b> to pick up their mail, or else pay for delivery by a private carrier. Free mail delivery began in American cities in 1863 with a limited scope. Shortly afterwards, rural citizens began petitioning for equal consideration. Postmaster General John Wanamaker first suggested rural free deliver (RFD) of mail in the United States in his annual report for fiscal year 1891.|$|R
50|$|A {{loop line}} or loop around is a {{telephone}} company test circuit. The circuit has two associated phone numbers. When {{one side of}} the loop is called (side A), the caller receives a test tone of approximately 1000 Hz (milliwatt test). When the second number (side B) is called, it produces dead silence, but the party on side A hears the milliwatt test tone drop, and is connected to the person on side B. The purpose of the loop around test is to allow circuit testing to a <b>distant</b> central <b>office</b> without needing a person at the far end. The technician can send a tone down either line and measure the response tone on the second line to determine the path loss parameters.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{globalization}} {{in the world}} economy, most multinational organizations have changed the way they conduct business. This change also influenced the structure and working of IT services-providing companies. Due to the contemporary phenomenon of the world being seen as a global village, today organizations {{have access to a}} wider talent pool. Different multinational IT services-providing companies follow global software development models, while some of these also call people onshore from <b>distant</b> <b>offices</b> to work on different projects. In this scenario, cross-cultural teams are formed to work together and to fulfill clients’ requirements. The objective {{of this study is to}} identify cultural differences that affect the knowledge sharing process in IT services-providing companies. In this study, we present the case of a Swedish IT services-providing company that has extended operations into India. Our intention is to understand employees’ views about their work experience in a cross-cultural team. In this context, the study employs a qualitative approach, which helps to elucidate the role of national culture dimensions on an individual’s behavior within the workplace, as well as the impact national culture dimensions have on knowledge sharing processes. Six cross-cultural team members, who have the experience of working in a cross-cultural environment, were interviewed utilizing a semi-structured interview model. Data collection also includes two and half days of data collected during the observation of a cross-cultural team. The collected data helps to effectively clarify in-depth views about the concerns employees have while working within cross-cultural teams. The data collected was analyzed by applying hermeneutics, through which we mapped the answers to the theory of Hofstede on culture. The latter served as the indicator to focus on cultural dimensions that have decisive influence on knowledge sharing in cross-cultural environments. We conclude by highlighting several specific cultural factors that may affect knowledge sharing in cross-cultural environments. ...|$|R
5000|$|Each pair of plugs {{was part}} of a cord circuit with a switch {{associated}} that let the operator participate in the call. Each jack had a light above it that lit when the telephone receiver was lifted (the earliest systems required a generator on the phone to be cranked by hand). Lines from the central office were usually arranged along the bottom row. Before the advent of operator distance dialing and customer Direct Dial (DDD) calling, switchboard operators would work with their counterparts in the <b>distant</b> central <b>office</b> to complete long distance calls. With the development of computerized telephone dialing systems, many telephone calls which previously required a live operator can be placed automatically by the calling party without additional human intervention. Switchboard operators are typically required to have very strong communication skills.|$|R

50|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, {{residents}} of rural areas had to either travel to a <b>distant</b> post <b>office</b> {{to pick up}} their mail, or else pay for delivery by a private carrier. Postmaster General John Wanamaker, owner of a major department store, was ardently in favor of Rural Free Delivery (RFD), with many thousands of Americans living in rural communities who wanted to send and receive retail orders inexpensively. However, the adoption of a nationwide RFD system had many opponents. Some were simply opposed to the cost of the service. Private express carriers thought inexpensive rural mail delivery would eliminate their business, and many town merchants worried the service would reduce farm families' weekly visits to town to obtain goods and merchandise, or that mail order merchants selling through catalogs, such as Sears, Roebuck and Company might present significant competition.|$|R

5000|$|Watson, {{though a}} member of a {{minority}} faction in Congress, was nonetheless effective in passing landmark legislation. The most significant was a law to require the Post Office to deliver mail to remote farm families. Rural Free Delivery (RFD), legislation that Watson pushed through Congress in 1893, eliminated the need for individuals living in more remote homesteads to pick up mail, sometimes at <b>distant</b> post <b>offices,</b> or to pay private carriers for delivery. The legislation was opposed by private carriers, and by many small-town merchants who worried the service would reduce farm families' weekly visits to town to obtain goods and merchandise, or that mail order merchants selling through catalogs, such as Sears, Roebuck and Company might present significant competition. RFD became an official service in 1896. That year, 82 rural routes were put into operation. A massive undertaking, nationwide RFD service took several years to implement, and remains the [...] "biggest and most expensive endeavor" [...] ever instituted by the U.S. postal service.|$|R
50|$|An {{outgoing}} marker, being {{a complex}} control instrument {{with a short}} holding time, had the additional task of decoding the first three digits of the seven-digit telephone number to determine the routing to a distant exchange. A cross connect field had a terminal for each office code, which was cross connected to the coil of a route relay. When the office code point was grounded, it operated the route relay, whose contacts were wired in another cross connect or data field. Thus, the outgoing marker could select two office frames to search for idle trunks to the destination, and had pulsing information for the sender. The sender sent the telephone number to the <b>distant</b> terminating <b>office.</b> When one office was constructed, retired, or changed, staff in other offices received a Routing Letter, ordering the cross connect fields to be changed at a particular date and time, usually after midnight, to accommodate {{the change in the}} network. Translation cross connect fields such as these {{were among the first to}} be converted from soldered terminals to wire wrap.|$|R
50|$|Rural Free Delivery (RFD) is {{a service}} {{which began in}} the United States in the late 19th century, to deliver mail {{directly}} to rural farm families. Prior to RFD, individuals living in more remote homesteads had to pick up mail themselves at sometimes <b>distant</b> post <b>offices</b> or pay private carriers for delivery. RFD became a political football, with politicians promising it to voters and using it themselves to reach voters. The proposal to offer free rural delivery was not universally embraced. Private carriers and local shopkeepers feared a loss of business. The United States Post Office Department began experiments with Rural Free Delivery as early as 1890. However, it was not until 1893, when Georgia Congressman Thomas E. Watson pushed through legislation, that the practice was mandated. However, universal implementation was slow; RFD was not adopted generally in the United States Post Office until 1902. The rural delivery service uses a network of rural routes traveled by carriers to deliver and pick up mail to and from roadside mailboxes.|$|R

The views expressed here {{are those of}} the authors, not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis or the Federal Reserve System. Reducing the Risk at Community Banks: Is It Size or Geographic Diversification that Matters? Most community banks face relatively high levels of credit risk because they have relatively few loan customers (idiosyncratic risk) and are not geographically diversified (local market risk). We focus on merger strategies that community banks might pursue to improve their risk-return tradeoff, identifying in the process which type of risk is more important. We find that the greatest risk-reduction benefits are achieved by increasing a community bank’s size, regardless of where the merger partner is located. We interpret this result as evidence that idiosyncratic risk dominates local market risk, especially at rural banks. Community banks face enormous pressure to grow, yet the pressure to geographically diversify is limited. As a consequence, larger community banks are likely to replace smaller community banks, but their focus on relationship lending will not disappear. Banks will be able to serve the businesses and households in their communities without being forced to acquire and manage <b>offices</b> <b>distant</b> from their community roots...|$|R
