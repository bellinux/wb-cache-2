40|$|EDOARD (Electrodynamic De-Orbiting And Re-entry Device) {{exploits}} {{the basic}} concepts of electrodynamic drag on conductive tethers to de-boost LEO spacecraft efficiently and reliably. The system is jointly developed by Alenia Spazio and by University "La Sapienza" {{in view of}} potential commercial exploitation. An innovative engineering approach has tackled four critical issues: 1) the deployment mechanism, which ensures a purely passive extension of the tether under extremely small gravity gradients; 2) the tether structure and configuration, which guarantees a very high survivability to impacts from artificial and natural debris; 3) the inflatable passive electron collector, which increases {{the efficiency of the}} system while reducing the tether length to 4 - 5 km and 4) the <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>control</b> of the tether librations, which limits the effects of inherent dynamical system instability, while preserving high de-orbiting efficiencies. The configuration ensures de-orbiting times per unit mass of about 0. 09 day/kg from a circular, 1500 km altitude, 55 degree inclination...|$|E

50|$|The {{advantage}} of grid-friendly frequency response is that frequency is ubiquitous on an electric system. When a generator shuts {{down in one}} part of the system, all the loads everywhere in the system can simultaneously detect the change and respond instantly and appropriately without the need for a control system to detect the problem, a control center to make a decision, or a telecommunications network to deliver commands to millions of devices. This type of behavior changes frequency from a simple <b>electrodynamic</b> and <b>control</b> systems input to an emergent property. While there is still some controversy on the subject, it is believed that complex systems utilizing self-regulation through emergence are generally more resilient and flexible than are simpler top-down command and control systems.|$|R
40|$|Hollow cathodes {{have been}} used as a plasma-based {{electron}} source for many years in space applications ranging from active spacecraft potential <b>control,</b> <b>electrodynamic</b> tethers, and electric propulsion systems. Hollow cathodes currently available are adequate in regard to emission current level, lifetime, heater power level, and overall reliability; however, they are not adequate in regard to the time required to prepare them for operation (of order hours) and the time required to bring them to a temperature where they can be started with ease at moderate flow rate and reasonable voltage (~ 3 to 6 minutes). This is especially true when hollow cathodes are considered for sounding rocket missions with duration of only tens of minutes that are intended t...|$|R

40|$|Photonic crystal {{membranes}} (PCM) {{provide a}} versatile planar platform for on-chip implementations of photonic quantum circuits. One prominent quantum element is a coupled system {{consisting of a}} nanocavity and a single quantum dot (QD) which forms a fundamental building block for elaborate quantum information networks and a cavity quantum <b>electrodynamic</b> (cQED) system <b>controlled</b> by single photons. So far no fast tuning mechanism is available to achieve control within the system coherence time. Here we demonstrate dynamic tuning by monochromatic coherent acoustic phonons formed by a surface acoustic wave (SAW) with frequencies exceeding 1. 7 gigahertz, one order of magnitude faster than alternative approaches. We resolve a periodic modulation of the optical mode exceeding eight times its linewidth, preserving both the spatial mode profile and a high quality factor. Since PCMs confine photonic and phononic excitations, coupling optical to acoustic frequencies, our technique opens ways towards coherent acoustic control of optomechanical crystals.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{configuration}} for a tethered satellite system, named the &# 039;clustered electrodynamic tether system. &# 039; This configuration consists of multi-electrodynamic tethered satellite systems {{located in a}} record disk orbit, which is a useful orbit for formation flight of multisatellite. The main difference of the clustered electrodynamic tether system from usual constellation flight configurations is that the clustered electrodynamic tether system uses tethers. This new configuration, thus, {{can be interpreted as}} constellation flight both toward out-of-plane direction using a record disk orbit, and in-plane direction using tethers. If librational motion of the clustered electrodynamic tether system is synchronized, the clustered electrodynamic tether system can serve as a platform system to periodically capture launched payloads and to move them to higher altitude, or a system to periodically observe the atmosphere at different altitudes at the same time. To synchronize the librational motion of the clustered <b>electrodynamic</b> tether system, <b>control</b> methods based on the Kuramoto model are proposed. The Kuramoto model is a mathematical model {{that can be used to}} describe synchronized behavior of a large set of coupled oscillators. In this paper, the proposed control methods are validated by numerical simulations...|$|R
40|$|A French-Brazilian micro {{satellite}} (FBM) {{is scheduled}} to be launched in 2004. It will be placed in a low inclination (about 6 degrees) equatorial circular orbit at a height of 700 km. Among other French and Brazilian experiments, it will carry a Plasma Diagnostics Package (PDP) consisting of three experiments. A High Frequency Capacitance probe (HFC) to measure the absolute electron density along the satellite trajectory; a Langmuir Probe (LP) to measure the relative variation and the spectral distribution of electron density, and an Electron Temperature Probe (ETP) to measure the variations in the electron temperature and the space potential. The main objective of the PDP experiments is to make global observations of the characteristic features of low-latitude plasma bubbles, and to study the dynamic and <b>electrodynamic</b> processes that <b>control</b> the generation, development and decay of plasma bubbles. These satellite observations will be complemented by observations from a network of Ionosondes, Digisondes, Polarimeters, and VHF radars operated simultaneously from selected ground stations in Brazil and in other collaborating countries. The Brazilian experiments on board FBM will be controlled by the Brazilian Payload Computer (BPC), linked with the main computer that controls the functioning and operations of the satellite. Data from the LP experiment can be processed on board to save data memory...|$|R
40|$|Field {{measurements}} {{indicating that}} atmospheric secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles can {{be present in}} a highly viscous, glassy state have spurred numerous studies addressing low diffusivities of water in glassy aerosols. The focus of these studies is on kinetic limitations of hygroscopic growth and the plasticizing effect of water. In contrast, much less is known about diffusion limitations of organic molecules and oxidants in viscous matrices. These may affect atmospheric chemistry and gas–particle partitioning of complex mixtures with constituents of different volatility. In this study, we quantify the diffusivity of a volatile organic in a viscous matrix. Evaporation of single particles generated from an aqueous solution of sucrose and small amounts of volatile tetraethylene glycol (PEG- 4) is investigated in an <b>electrodynamic</b> balance at <b>controlled</b> relative humidity (RH) and temperature. The evaporative loss of PEG- 4 as determined by Mie resonance spectroscopy is {{used in conjunction with}} a radially resolved diffusion model to retrieve translational diffusion coefficients of PEG- 4. Comparison of the experimentally derived diffusivities with viscosity estimates for the ternary system reveals a breakdown of the Stokes–Einstein relationship, which has often been invoked to infer diffusivity from viscosity. The evaporation of PEG- 4 shows pronounced RH and temperature dependencies and is severely depressed for RH  ≲   30  %, corresponding to diffusivities <  10 − 14  cm 2  s − 1 at temperatures <  15  °C. The temperature dependence is strong, suggesting a diffusion activation energy of about 300  kJ mol − 1. We conclude that atmospheric volatile organic compounds can be subject to severe diffusion limitations in viscous organic aerosol particles. This may enable an important long-range transport mechanism for organic material, including pollutant molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) ...|$|R
