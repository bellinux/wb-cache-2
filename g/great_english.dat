5|$|John Parkinson (15671650; buried 6 August 1650) was {{the last}} of the <b>great</b> <b>English</b> {{herbalists}} {{and one of the first}} of the <b>great</b> <b>English</b> botanists. He was apothecary to James I and a founding member of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries in December 1617, and was later Royal Botanist to Charles I. He is known for two monumental works, Paradisi in Sole Paradisus Terrestris (Park-in-Sun's Terrestrial Paradise, 1629), which generally describes the proper cultivation of plants; and Theatrum Botanicum (The Botanical Theatre or Theatre of Plants, 1640), the most complete and beautifully presented English treatise on plants of its time. One of the most eminent gardeners of his day, he kept a botanical garden at Long Acre in Covent Garden, today close to Trafalgar Square, and maintained close relations with other important English and Continental botanists, herbalists and plantsmen.|$|E

Together with the Committee, Marden was responsible for organising the curriculum and hiring the appropriate staff.|$|E
5|$|Between 1818 and 1820, she absorbed a {{considerable}} amount of drama, reading many of William Shakespeare's plays, some with Percy. Percy believed that Mary had a talent for dramatic writing, and convinced her to study the <b>great</b> <b>English,</b> French, Latin, and Italian plays as well as dramatic theory. He even sought her advice on his play The Cenci, and she transcribed the manuscript of his drama Prometheus Unbound. The Shelleys also attended operas, ballets, and plays. Percy also encouraged Mary to translate Vittorio Alfieri's play Mirra (1785), a tragedy about father-daughter incest which influenced her own novel Mathilda.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{overwhelming}} grief {{caused by the}} death of her two children, Mary Shelley continued to study and read as she had throughout her life. Between 1818 and 1820, she exposed herself to quite a bit of drama. She read many of William Shakespeare's plays, some with Percy Shelley. Percy believed that Mary had a talent for drama and convinced her to study the <b>great</b> <b>English,</b> French, Latin, and Italian plays as well as drama theory. He even sought her advice regarding his play The Cenci. Less glamorously, Mary transcribed the manuscript of Percy's drama Prometheus Unbound.

5|$|In 1333 he {{took part}} in Edward's Scottish campaign, though {{it is unclear whether}} he was present at the <b>great</b> <b>English</b> victory at the Battle of Halidon Hill. After further service in the north, he was {{appointed}} the King's lieutenant in Scotland in 1336. The next year {{he was one of the}} six men Edward III promoted to the higher levels of the peerage. One of his father's lesser titles, that of Earl of Derby, was bestowed upon Grosmont.|$|E
5|$|Cricket {{has been}} played in Hadspen, at Entally and grounds nearer the town's centre, {{since at least}} the 1860s.

During his side's 1874 tour of Australia the <b>great</b> <b>English</b> cricketer W. G. Grace played on the ground. Aside from cricket Entally's grounds were often open for picnics and grand annual events. The Hadspen Chieftains cricket club was formed in the 1987–88 season and plays as part of the Northern Tasmania Cricket Association.

5|$|Henry's son, {{also called}} Henry, {{was born at}} the castle of Grosmont in Monmouthshire between 1299 and 1314. According to the younger Henry's memoirs, he was better at martial arts than {{academic}} subjects and did not learn to read until later in life. Henry was coeval with Edward III and was pivotal to his reign, becoming his best friend and most trusted commander. Henry was knighted in 1330, represented his father in parliament and fought in Edward's Scottish campaign. After {{the outbreak of the}} Hundred Years' War, Henry took part in several diplomatic missions and minor campaigns and was present at the <b>great</b> <b>English</b> victory in the naval Battle of Sluys in 1340. Later, he was required to commit himself as hostage in the Low Countries for Edward’s considerable debts. He remained hostage for a year and had to pay a large ransom for his own release.|$|E
5|$|Increasingly, Edward {{began to}} rely on his sons for the {{leadership}} of military operations. The king's second son, Lionel of Antwerp, attempted to subdue by force the largely autonomous Anglo-Irish lords in Ireland. The venture failed, and the only lasting mark he left were the suppressive Statutes of Kilkenny in 1366. In France, meanwhile, the decade following the Treaty of Brétigny was one of relative tranquillity, but on 8 April 1364 JohnII died in captivity in England, after unsuccessfully trying to raise his own ransom at home. He {{was followed by the}} vigorous CharlesV, who enlisted the help of the capable Constable Bertrand du Guesclin. In 1369, the French war started anew, and Edward's younger son John of Gaunt was given the responsibility of a military campaign. The effort failed, and with the Treaty of Bruges in 1375, the <b>great</b> <b>English</b> possessions in France were reduced to only the coastal towns of Calais, Bordeaux, and Bayonne.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Hundred Years' War in 1337, Grosmont's attention was turned towards France. He took part in several diplomatic missions and minor campaigns and was present at the <b>great</b> <b>English</b> victory in the naval Battle of Sluys in 1340. Later the same year, he was required to commit himself as hostage in the Low Countries for the king's considerable debts. He remained hostage until the next year and had to pay a large ransom for his own release. On his return he was made the king's lieutenant in the north and stayed at Roxburgh until 1342. The next years he spent in diplomatic negotiations in the Low Countries, Castile and Avignon.|$|E

25|$|Ramsgate is a {{seaside town}} in the {{district}} of Thanet in east Kent, England. It was one of the <b>great</b> <b>English</b> seaside towns of the 19th century. In 2001 it had a population of around 40,000. Ramsgate’s main attraction is its coastline, and its main industries are tourism and fishing. The town has one of the largest marinas on the English south coast, and the Port of Ramsgate has provided cross-channel ferries for many years.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>great</b> <b>English</b> {{translation}} was the Wycliffe Bible (c. 1382), {{which showed}} {{the weaknesses of}} an underdeveloped English prose. Only {{at the end of}} the 15th century did the great age of English prose translation begin with Thomas Malory's Le Morte Darthur—an adaptation of Arthurian romances so free that it can, in fact, hardly be called a true translation. The first great Tudor translations are, accordingly, the Tyndale New Testament (1525), which influenced the Authorized Version (1611), and Lord Berners' version of Jean Froissart's Chronicles (1523–25).|$|E

25|$|While recuperating in England and {{receiving}} treatment from Sir William Gull, Muybridge {{took up the}} new field of professional photography sometime between 1861 and 1866. Muybridge later stated that he had changed his vocation {{at the suggestion of}} his physician. He learned the wet-plate collodion process in England, and may have been influenced by some of the <b>great</b> <b>English</b> photographers of those years, such as Julia Margaret Cameron. Also during this period, Muybridge secured at least two British patents for his inventions, including the design of a high speed electrical shutter and electro-timer, to be used alongside a battery of up to 24 cameras.|$|E
25|$|Whoever the architect, {{nevertheless}} a great mansion arose. Today {{only one}} {{other part of the}} Tudor mansion survives: the great tower in the centre of the east facade (see illustration above). With its central arch (once giving access to the court beyond) and three floors of oriel windows above, the tower is slightly reminiscent of the entrance at Hampton Court. Flanked today by two wings in a loose Georgian style – each topped by an Italianate pavilion tower, this Tudor centrepiece of the facade appears not in the least incongruous, merely displaying the accepted appearance of a <b>great</b> <b>English</b> country house, which has evolved over the centuries.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>great</b> <b>English</b> {{sides have}} been built around Scottish players. The double winning Spurs team of 1961 {{included}} Bill Brown, Dave Mackay and John White. Denis Law is the second greatest goalscorer {{in the history of}} Manchester United. The great Liverpool teams of the 1970s and 1980s were built around Kenny Dalglish, Graeme Souness and Alan Hansen, while Nottingham Forest's double European Cup-winning side included Archie Gemmill, John McGovern, John Robertson, and FWA Footballer of the Year Kenny Burns. Manchester United and Liverpool became the most successful clubs in English football, largely due to the efforts of Scottish managers Matt Busby and Bill Shankly, respectively.|$|E

It was a period bristling with violent political and religious prejudices, provocative of strife that amounted to revolution. Its social life ran the gamut from the severity of the Commonwealth Puritan to the unbridled debauchery of the Restoration Courtier. In literature it experienced a remarkable transformation in poetry, and developed modern prose, watched the production of the <b>greatest</b> <b>English</b> epics, smarted under the lash of the <b>greatest</b> <b>English</b> satires, blushed at the brilliant wit of unspeakable comedies, and applauded the beginnings of English criticism.|$|R
