40|$|ABSTRACT. Based on the {{qualitative}} considerations that the flow durability in the combustor {{plays an important}} role not only in combustion enhancement but also in heat transfer enhancement, the main attention is paid on the flow durability in the cooling period after the pressure attains maximum. Four types of constant-volume combustors are used; a cylindrical combustor with a hemi-sphere-shaped <b>divided</b> <b>chamber,</b> one with a pan-cake-shaped <b>divided</b> <b>chamber,</b> a fan-stirred combustorand a simple cylindrical combustor. The latter is used for getting standard combustion properties. Enhancement behavior of combustion and heat transfer is examined by analysing pressure histories after the spark ignition. Flow visualization in the fan-stirred combustoris made using a cold water flow. It is found that the fan-stirred combustor can realize and maintain a complex flow pattern in the cooling period and realizesimultaneously strong heat transfer enhancement and moderate combustion enhancement...|$|E
40|$|A {{heat release}} {{analysis}} of experimental pressure diagrams, appropriate. for <b>divided</b> <b>chamber</b> diesel engines, is developed {{and used to}} obtain heat release rate profiles during the combustion process {{in each of the}} two combustion chambers. Attention is paid to the correct processing of the data, due to the inherent complexity of the mass interchange between the two chambers. The analysis refers to a turbocharged, indirect injection (<b>divided</b> <b>chamber)</b> diesel engine, located at the authors' laboratory, which has a small pre-chamber and a very narrow connecting passageway. The experimental indicator diagrams obtained from both chambers are processed in connection with the pertinent application of the energy and state equations. From the analysis results, plots of the history in the two chambers of the heat release rates, temperatures, heat fluxes, equivalence ratios, etc. reveal some very interesting features, which aid the interpretation of the associated combustion mechanism.

40|$|Biophysical and {{numerical}} analysis methods {{were used to}} characterize and model the transport protein that {{gives rise to the}} acid and alkaline regions of Chara. A measuring system that permits the detection of area-specific current-voltage curves was used. These current-voltage curves, obtained from the inward current regions of Chara, underwent a parallel shift when the alkaline region was inverted by means of an acid pH treatment. In this situation the reversal potential of this area shifted from - 120 mV to - 340 mV. Together with data obtained from experiments using a <b>divided</b> <b>chamber</b> system, these results suggest that a common transport protein generates inward and outward current regions of Chara. On the basis of these experimental findings, a reaction kinetic model is proposed that assigns two operational modes to the proposed transport protein. Switching between these modes generates either acid or alkaline behavior. Since the observed pH dependence of the postulated transporter is rather complex, a reaction kinetic saturation mechanism had to be incorporated into the model. This final 10 -state reaction kinetic model provides an appropriate set of mathematical relations to fit the measured current-voltage curves by computer...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a computer simulation of the exhaust nitric oxide and soot emission histories from a four stroke, naturally aspirated, Diesel engine with a swirl prechamber (<b>divided</b> <b>chamber).</b> The simulation {{is based on}} a thermodynamic analysis, which was validated successfully concerning the performance of the engine (load, fuel consumption, maximum pressures, etc). The analysis includes the calculation of the heat exchange between gas and walls in both the main chamber and (swirl) prechamber, after computing the relevant characteristic velocities and lengths, while combustion in both the main chamber and the swirl prechamber is attacked by proposing a two-zone combustion model. The concentration of the constituents in the exhaust gases is calculated by incorporating a complete chemical equilibrium scheme for the C-H-O system of the eleven species considered, together with chemical rate equations for the calculation of nitric oxide (NO). A model for the evaluation of soot formation and oxidation rates is also included, in order to compute the net soot concentration. The contribution of each chamber to the formation of NO and soot is given by presenting time (crank angle) diagrams of the net NO and soot formation inside each chamber (histories of formation). To validate the analysis, an extensive experimental investigation is undertaken at the authors' laboratory on a Diesel engine of this type by evaluating its exhaust emission characteristics {{in a wide range of}} operating conditions. The experimental results are found to be in good agreement with the theoretical results obtained from the computer program implementing the analysis, while the detailed NO and soot net formation histories provide insight into the mechanisms involved. © 1990 VDI Verlag GmbH...|$|E

40|$|Aluminum (Al) {{toxicity}} {{and phosphorus}} (P) deficiency often coexist in acid soils that severely limit crop growth and production, including soybean (Glycine max). Understanding the physiological mechanisms relating to plant Al and P interactions should help facilitate {{the development of}} more Al-tolerant and/or P-efficient crops. In this study, both homogeneous and heterogeneous nutrient solution experiments were conducted to study the effects of Al and P interactions on soybean root growth and root organic acid exudation. In the homogenous solution experiments with a uniform Al and P distribution in the bulk solution, P addition significantly increased Al tolerance in four soybean genotypes differing in P efficiency. The two P-efficient genotypes appeared to be more Al tolerant than the two P-inefficient genotypes under these high-P conditions. Analysis of root exudates indicated Al toxicity induced citrate exudation, P deficiency triggered oxalate exudation, and malate release was induced by both treatments. To more closely mimic low-P acid soils where P deficiency and Al toxicity are often much greater in the lower soil horizons, a divided root chamber/nutrient solution approach was employed to impose elevated P conditions in the simulated upper soil horizon, and Al toxicity/P deficiency in the lower horizon. Under these conditions, we found that the two P-efficient genotypes were more Al tolerant during {{the early stages of the}} experiment than the P-inefficient lines. Although the same three organic acids were exuded by roots in the <b>divided</b> <b>chamber</b> experiments, their exudation patterns were different from those in the homogeneous solution system. The two P-efficient genotypes secreted more malate from the taproot tip, suggesting that improved P nutrition may enhance exudation of organic acids in the root regions dealing with the greatest Al toxicity, thus enhancing Al tolerance. These findings demonstrate that P efficiency may play a role in Al tolerance in soybean. Phosphorus-efficient genotypes may be able to enhance Al tolerance not only through direct Al-P interactions but also through indirect interactions associated with stimulated exudation of different Al-chelating organic acids in specific roots and root regions...|$|E
40|$|Described in {{this thesis}} are {{the results of an}} {{experimental}} and theoretical study of the effects of turbulence on combustion in single and dual chamber spark ignition engines. The techniques adopted in the experimental study included the use of high speed cine photography, and the collection of simultaneous cylinder pressure records using an on-line computer. The experimental results confirmed the potential of the dual chamber design for increasing burning rate, and for controlling the level of turbulence within an engine cylinder. High speed photographs were filmed through a perspex window in the engine cylinder head. These showed that flame propagation was much faster when the engine was fitted with a <b>divided</b> <b>chamber</b> cylinder head than when equipped with a disc shaped single chamber head. The acceleration of combustion rate {{has been shown to be}} a function of flow velocity through the interconnecting orifice during the compression stroke. At very high flow velocities the nozzle became choked, and engine performance was impaired. In the theoretical work, a computer model for the thermodynamic cycle of an engine was developed. The use in this model of empirical laws to describe combustion rate was shown to be inadequate; this was primarily because of uncertainty in the length of the combustion period, which one needs to specify when using this method. When burning velocity data (derived from work by colleagues using a turbulent combustion bomb) were incorporated into the model, good qualitative results were possible. The use of an empirical law to describe the effect of turbulence on the burning velocity of a developing flame was, however, shown to be inaccurate. The turbulent flame front in an engine is a thick reaction zone containing pockets of unbumt charge. Analysis o f data for flame projected area (derived from high speed photographs) and simultaneous cylinder pressure data, revealed that a considerable quantity of unburnt charge was present behind the visible flame front. There was some evidence that a greater proportion of unburnt charge was present behind the flame when the mixture was lean than when it was stoichiometric. Modelling of this effect by assuming that mass, once entrained, would burn at an exponential rate, was shown to produce reasonable results...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of Al exposure on long-distance Ca 2 + translocation from specific root zones (root apex or mature root) to the shoot was studied in intact seedlings of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars (Al-tolerant Atlas 66 and Al-sensitive Scout 66). Seedlings were grown in 100 [mu]M CaCl 2 solution (pH 4. 5) for 3 d. Subsequently, a <b>divided</b> <b>chamber</b> technique using 45 Ca 2 +-labeled solutions (100 [mu]M CaCl 2 {{with or without}} 5 or 20 [mu]M AlCl 3, pH 4. 5) was used to study Ca 2 + translocation from either the terminal 5 to 10 mm of the root or a 10 -mm region of intact root approximately 50 mm behind the root apex. The Al concentrations used, which were toxic to Scout 66, caused a significant inhibition of Ca 2 + translocation from the apical region of Scout 66 roots. The same Al exposures had a much smaller effect on root apical Ca 2 + translocation in Atlas 66. When a 10 -mm region of the mature root was exposed to 45 Ca 2 +, smaller genotypic differences in the Al effects effects on Ca 2 + translocation were observed, because the degree of Al-induced inhibition of Ca 2 + translocation was less than that at the root apex. Exposure of the root apex to Al inhibited root elongation by 70 to 99 % in Scout 66 but had a lesser effect (less than 40 % inhibition) in Atlas 66. When a mature root region was exposed to Al, root elongation was not significantly affected in either cultivar. These results demonstrate that genotypic differences in Al-induced inhibition of Ca 2 + translocation and root growth are localized primarily in the root apex. The pattern of Ca 2 + translocation within the intact root was mainly basipetal, {{with most of the}} absorbed Ca 2 + translocated toward the shoot. A small amount of acropetal Ca 2 + translocation from the mature root regions to the apex was also observed, which accounted for less than 5 % of the total Ca 2 + translocation within the entire root. Because Ca 2 + translocation toward the root apex is limited, most of the Ca 2 + needed for normal cellular function in the apex must be absorbed from the external solution. Thus, continuous Al disruption of Ca 2 + absorption into cells of the root apex could alter Ca 2 + nutrition and homeostasis in these cells and could play a pivotal role in the mechanisms of Al toxicity in Al-sensitive wheat cultivars...|$|E
