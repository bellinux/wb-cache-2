40|$|The article {{considers}} quality impact {{influence of}} surface on aircraft take-off. It considers the IL- 114 takeoff {{with all the}} operating engines. The goal {{of this research is}} to conduct calculating experiment to determine quality influence of surface on alteration of IL- 114 takeoff characteristics during operation. Researches were carried out using the system of mathematical modeling of a flight dynamics. The main part of the system is a unit for calculating increments of aerodynam- ic coefficients caused with changing of technical condition of the surface of the airframe (roughness, waviness, available protruding elements on the airframe surface, etc.) and residual deformation of the wing, fuselage, vertical and horizontal tail, as well as the difference between the rods symmetrically operating engines. In order to compute loss of rod and an increase in engine fuel consumption due to engine operation time during operation, an integral factor of thrust loss and increase in fuel consumption coefficient were introduced. Research proved that the individual characteristics of the aircraft, due to loss of engine power and increase in drag do not affect the assigned level of flight safety. The plane has a considera- ble reserve as for unsafe takeoff speed and the full <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb,</b> that ensures safety of operation...|$|E

The average <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> the total <b>climb</b> and also the average gradients per kilometre differ slightly, depending on the source of the information.

50|$|Mount Buffalo is {{a popular}} {{destination}} for road cyclists due to the challenging yet scenic {{climb to the top}} of the mountain. From the now defunct tollbooth at the base of the mountain to the Mount Buffalo Chalet it's a 20.9 km climb at an average <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> 4.8%.

40|$|Data {{presented}} {{indicate that}} the wing-mounted spline is a effective vortex-attenuating device. A comparison of the vortex induced rolling moment results at a separation scale distance of 0. 70 km with those measured in full scale flight indicate good agreement for the unattenuated vortex configuration. The comparison also indicates that the spline effectiveness in flight was greater than in the ground facility test. The results of an applications study show that, for the heavy commercial jet aircraft studied, use of the splines does result in some degradation <b>of</b> the <b>climb</b> <b>gradient</b> and rate <b>of</b> <b>climb,</b> but the aircraft should meet certification requirements...|$|R
500|$|The {{second stage}} started {{where the first}} had finished, in Markina-Xemein, and headed {{south-west}} towards the finish in Amurrio. It began with a second-category climb {{very early in the}} stage; after a flat section came two more climbs, one third-category and one second-category. After a long plateau and a descent, the riders arrived in Amurrio for the first time. Another third-category ascent followed; at the summit there were [...] to the finish. Most of this was over fairly flat roads as the riders looped around Amurrio, but the final part of the race was a steep climb, the [...] Alto de Garrastatxu, with an average <b>gradient</b> <b>of</b> 11.7%.

2500|$|The last stage {{before the}} second and final rest day of the race, the sixteenth stage of the race was set up as the toughest day <b>of</b> <b>climbing</b> in the entire race, and as a result, was deemed the queen stage of the race.
