A total of 170 HIV-seropositive adults presenting with herpes zoster (confirmed by direct fluorescent-antigen testing and/or viral culture) were enrolled and randomized to receive a 10 -day course of orally administered sorivudine (40 mg once daily plus acyclovir placebos) or acyclovir (800 mg five times daily plus sorivudine placebo). Patients were monitored daily to document the events of cutaneous healing, pain, zoster-related complications, and drug-related adverse events. Patients were reassessed on days 21 and 28 and then once monthly for 1 year. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to the cessation of new vesicle formation. Secondary efficacy endpoints included times to other events of cutaneous healing, resolution of pain, and <b>frequency</b> of <b>dissemination</b> and zoster recurrence. In a multivariate analysis, sorivudine was superior to acyclovir for reducing the times to the cessation of new vesicle formation (relative risk [RR] = 1. 54, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 00 to 2. 36; P = 0. 049) and total lesion crusting (RR = 1. 48, 95 % CI = 1. 07 to 2. 04; P = 0. 017).

This conflict can be solved by the implementation of modern noise reduction techniques like Active Structural Acoustic Control (ASAC) in aircraft. In this paper an approach for the reduction of noise transmission through a section of a fuselage is presented. The experimental aircraft Dornier 728 of the DLR is equipped with an ASAC system. The system is mounted on a side panel including two windows and covers an area of 1000 x 1500 mm^ 2. Sensors on the inner fuselage measure the normal acceleration in specified points of the structure. A narrow-band robust controller calculates the desired actuator signals to reduce the sound transmission at the specific CROR bands in the bandwidth from 1 to 500 Hz. Since the Dornier 728 aircraft has no CROR engines, their acoustic excitations have to be synthesized. A 112 -channel loudspeaker array is placed close to the fuselage. The loudspeakers are driven with synthesized signals and produce a complex CROR sound pressure field on the outer side of the fuselage. The synthesized excitation gives the opportunity to test the ASAC system with realistic loads.

We prospectively evaluated the diagnostic value of PCR {{in comparison with}} CSF cytomorphology and MRI for diagnosing meningeal dissemination in PCNSL. METHODS: We evaluated 282 patients from a multicenter therapy study for PCNSL {{for the presence of}} meningeal dissemination: 205 with CSF cytomorphology, 171 with PCR of the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes in CSF, and 217 with cranial MRI. RESULTS: Meningeal dissemination was found in 33 of 205 patients (16 %) by cytomorphology, in 19 of 171 (11 %) patients evaluated by PCR, and in 8 of 217 patients (4 %) by MRI. Considering either of these methods, the relative <b>frequency</b> of meningeal <b>dissemination</b> was 17. 4 % (49 of 282 patients). PCR was monoclonal in 6 of 19 (32 %) samples with positive cytomorphology, 1 of 13 samples (8 %) with suspicious cytology, and in 10 of 105 (10 %) cytologically negative samples. In 11 samples with positive and 12 with suspicious cytology, PCR showed only a polyclonal pattern. The probability of meningeal dissemination detection was higher in cases with CSF pleocytosis (> 5 /microL) with an OR of 2. 48 (95 % CI 1. 15 - 5. 34, p = 0. 018). CSF protein had no predictive value for meningeal dissemination detection. CONCLUSIONS: We found a low rate of meningeal dissemination in primary CNS lymphoma in this large prospective study.

40|$|Borrelia burgdorferi, the {{etiologic}} agent of Lyme disease, is genetically heterogeneous. Previous {{studies have shown}} a significant association between the <b>frequency</b> of hematogenous <b>dissemination</b> in Lyme disease patients and the genotype of the infecting B. burgdorferi strain. Comparative transcriptional profiling of two representative clinical isolates with distinct genotypes (BL 206 and B 356) was undertaken. A total of 78 open reading frames (ORFs) had expression levels that differed significantly between the two isolates. A number of genes with potential involvement in nutrient uptake (BB 0603, BBA 74, BB 0329, BB 0330, and BBB 29) have significantly higher expression levels in isolate B 356. Moreover, nearly 25 % of the differentially expressed genes are predicted to be localized on the cell surface, implying that these two isolates have cell surface properties that differ considerably. One of these genes, BBA 74, encodes a protein of 257 amino acid residues that {{has been shown to}} possess porin activity. BBA 74 transcript level was > 20 -fold higher in B 356 than in BL 206, and strain B 356 contained three- to fivefold more BBA 74 protein. BBA 74 was disrupted by the insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette into the coding region. The growth rates of both wild-type and mutant strains were essentially identical, and cultures reached the same final cell densities. However, the mutant strains consistently showed prolonged lags of 2 to 5 days prior to the induction of log-phase growth compared to wild-type strains. It is tempting to speculate that the absence of BBA 74 interferes with the enhanced nutrient uptake that may be required for the entry of cells into log-phase growth. These studies demonstrate the value of comparative transcriptional profiling for identifying differences in the transcriptomes of B. burgdorferi clinical isolates that may provide clues to pathogenesis. The 78 ORFs identified here are a good starting point for the investigation of factors involved in the hematogenous dissemination of B. burgdorferi...|$|R
