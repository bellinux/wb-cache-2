40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>faith-based</b> <b>organisations</b> in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and Philadelphia, USA. It was prompted by debates about the persistence of religion in seemingly secular societies and contexts and related questions about the role and relationship of <b>faith-based</b> <b>organisations</b> to the neighbourhood and non-faith community. Some scholars have suggested that increasingly the rhetorical moves of neoliberalism create specific spaces for <b>faith-based</b> <b>organisations</b> encouraging a kind of marketization in non-economic spheres. This study suggests that while the neoliberalizing urban carved out a niche for <b>faith-based</b> <b>organisations,</b> declining participation in conventional religious spaces and rites led these organisations to search for new meanings and roles for themselves. The forces that allowed these <b>faith-based</b> <b>organisations</b> a particular and meaningful role in the city were not religion versus secularity, but rather an unexpected interplay of neo-liberalism and secularism {{that can be seen}} the ways they attempt to create local and national ties through enhancing resident connections to neighbourhood and community The process of constant comparison has been central to this study and in doing so, it has enhanced our understanding of <b>faith-based</b> <b>organisations</b> by offering a new comparative perspective that recognises the significance of the interplay between neoliberalism and secularism. In adopting a comparative perspective that specifically juxtaposes a putatively secular nation (the Netherlands) against a putatively religious one (the U. S. A), it has been possible to discern common threads that have encouraged and facilitated these organisations in very different national contexts. ...|$|R

Second, different types of <b>faith-based</b> <b>organisation</b> {{play an active role}} in the lives of the poor and in the political contests that affect them.

The strategic and operational branches of WVSA demonstrate significant variation in their conceptualisations of ‘transformational development’, highlighting both the complexity of translating theory into practice, and the negotiation of the differing interests inherent to this process. A predominantly secular discourse of dependency is identified as operating implicitly throughout WVSA. This discourse is seen to inform key conceptualisations within WVSA’s ‘transformational development’ approach, with a significant and potentially deleterious impact on the transformative potential of its practice...|$|E

Following an {{introductory}} chapter in which the research methodology and modus operandi are being explained, Chapter 2 is devoted to a discussion, in the light of recent literature, of the concept of unemployment and the effect of unemployment on the individual, the family and society. In Chapter 3 the discussion focuses on the involvement of faith-based organisations in addressing unemployment as part of social development. In Chapter 4 the empirical survey, conducted by means of semi structured interviews with church leaders in the Paarl-Wellington-area, is described. The interpreted results are discussed in Chapter 5 according to main themes, sub themes and categories. A literature control is carried out simultaneously. Based upon the literature study and the findings of the empirical survey, certain conclusions are drawn and recommendations are made in chapter 6. These recommendations are specifically aimed at activating the church in the form of local congregations to get actively involved in dealing with unemployment in their environment and community.

This study aimed to examine the complex experiences of NGO-employed HIV caregivers in peri-urban informal settlements. This study provides an overview of the literature pertaining to NGO-employed HIV caregivers. Due {{to the fact that the}} caregivers who participated in this study worked for a <b>faith-based</b> <b>organisation,</b> this study examined the possible role of religiosity in influencing the experiences of the caregivers. Twelve in depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with NGO-employed HIV caregivers who worked for a faith-based (Christian) organisation. Thematic content analysis was used to analyse data generated by the interviews. Religiosity is common to the majority of the themes identified, and seems to play an important role in the way in which the caregivers cope with stress, the way that they treat their patients, the way that caregivers perveive people in informal settlements to think about HIV, as well as the way in which they feel that communities within informal settlements think about and deal with HIV. The results of this study have various implications for future research, theory and policy regarding HIV caregivers, home-based care in South Africa, as well as the possible role of faith-based organisations in assisting with the HIV pandemic...|$|E
40|$|MM 2013 ABSTRACT There is {{a growing}} social role Faith-based Organisations (FBOs) are playing. Various stake holders like {{sponsors}} and donors insist on proper governance and efficiency in these organisations, sometimes {{as a condition for}} receiving grants. Knowledge Management (KM) has been lauded as one of the managerial tools that can help any organisation enhance the execution of its strategy and render it competitive. KM has generally been applied in the public as well as the private sector (business) to drastically improve their efficiency and effectiveness. The concept has also been tried in the Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) with much success. However there is scarcity of literature on KM in Faith Based Organization (FBOs). In this research paper, the researcher uses a <b>faith-based</b> <b>organisation,</b> the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) as a unit of analysis in a case study based research. Through a triangulation of interviews, questionnaires and document analysis as well as an extensive literature review, the researcher comes to a conclusion {{that it is possible to}} apply Knowledge Management (KM) also to FBOs in order to bolster their efficiency in the delivery of social services. FBOs have unique organisational links with the religious entities to which they affiliate but offer the same structural composition that is open to the application of many modern managerial concepts including KM...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} articulates a dialectical {{theory of}} the border. It argues that the border {{should be viewed as}} a ‘concrete abstraction’ that is at once reified as an ideal object, and extends both spatially and temporally to bear down on the concrete experience of day-to-day life in divisive and often malign ways. The research explores the tragedy of the border for those on whom it bears down and pushes in to destitution, and attempts to challenge this injustice. This is an ethnographic study, and particular focus is given to the experiences of destitute asylum seekers making use of a network of night shelters provided by the Boaz Trust in Manchester, UK. The Boaz Trust is a <b>faith-based</b> <b>organisation</b> that provides accommodation, support, and advocacy to refused asylum seekers in the city and aims to ‘end asylum destitution’. Based on participant observation working in the shelters as a volunteer, time spent living in the shelters, and time alongside destitute asylum seekers on the streets of Manchester, I explore the simultaneous experience of inclusion and exclusion that characterises ‘spaces of asylum’ in the city, and of a ‘weaponised time’ marked by a bifurcated ‘waiting’; where individuals see out each day without the right to work, access public funds, or remain in the UK while also caught up in a longer term, antagonistic, and dysfunctional bureaucratic temporality. I also examine the attempts of volunteers working in the shelters to press against such injustices, exploring these attempts within an understanding of justice as coming in to being through repetitive, arduous and often banal practices of care, and as speculative, fragile and always incomplete...|$|E

Objectives: To identify {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} FBOs in terms of HIV prevention. The questions posed were, (1) ‘What is the influence of religion on sexual behaviour in Africa?’, and (2) ‘What are the factors that enable religion to have an influence on sexual behaviour?’. Method: A literature search of Medline, SABINET, Africa Wide NIPAD and Google Scholar was conducted. Results: The potential for <b>Faith-based</b> <b>organisations</b> to be important role-players in HIV prevention is undermined by the church’s difficulties with discussing sexuality, avoiding stigma, gender issues and acceptance of condoms. It appears that, in contrast with high-income countries, religiosity does not have an overall positive impact on risky sexual behaviour in Africa. Churches may, however, have a positive impact on alcohol use and its associated risky behaviour, as well as self-efficacy. The influence of the church on sexual behaviour may also be associated with the degree of social engagement and control within the church culture. Conclusion: <b>Faith-based</b> <b>organisations</b> have the potential to be an important role player in terms of HIV prevention. However, in order to be more effective, the church needs to take up the challenge of empowering young women, recognising the need for their sexually-active youth to use protection, reducing judgemental attitudes and changing the didactical methods used.

In South Africa {{there are}} great {{polarities}} in terms of needs in resource–poor communities versus communities with available resources. This is evident during visits to Sir Lowry's Pass Village and when available statistics on trends in the community are taken into account. A potentially valuable resource in resource–poor communities is outreach programmes by a <b>faith–based</b> <b>organisation</b> (FBO) such as Jabulani Africa Ministries (JAM). JAM is a Christian FBO with a strong community focus. This study focuses on the resource–poor community of Sir Lowry's Pass Village, situated in the Helderberg Basin in the Western Cape. Sir Lowry's Pass Village {{is just one of}} a few resource–poor communities to whom JAM reaches out on a weekly basis since through their outreach programme aimed at middle–childhood children. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore and describe the content of this outreach programme of JAM in Sir Lowry's Pass Village aimed at middle–childhood children in order to provide guidelines to more specifically target the needs of the particular group of children. Data were collected from various sources according to principles of participatory action research. Data were organised through thematic data analysis to identify themes. Two core themes emerged; one theme is a mutual lack of understanding of the broader field by JAM members and the target of their interventions, middle–childhood children. The other theme centred on the moral value system of the particular group of children. The central theoretical argument of this study is that outreach programmes by faith–based organisations (such as JAM) in resource–poor communities should be directed as effectively as possible to meet the needs of middle–childhood children.

Among the programs is a church-based Inclusive Community Program aimed at revitalising {{the family unit}} and the community through series of training workshops covering community related skills, knowledge and attitudes. This paper describes {{the involvement of the}} Anglican Church of Melanesia in a peacebuilding and community development program in Solomon Islands. The aim {{of this paper is to}} report the initiation and the first stages of the implementation of the program, and includes a case study of how a <b>faith-based</b> <b>organisation</b> engaged in peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction in a conflict society. The church’s post-conflict community development program is still being implemented and therefore, this paper is not intended to provide a rigorous evaluation of the program or an assessment of tangible impacts on the community. As a narrative case study, it describes the peacebuilding initiatives undertaken by the State during the conflict and provides insights into why the State’s peace activities failed to restore peace. It is the inability of the State to broker peace, which urged the Anglican Church of Melanesia to become involved in the country’s efforts to restore peace. After the conflict, the church saw the need to empower the community so that every family would rebuild their lives through an initiative called ‘Inclusive Community Program. ’ Although it is too early to judge the success of the Program, there is evidence in the case study stories that change is taking shape in the community. Thus, the church is envisaging that communities will have families that have improved skills, knowledge and attitudes about healthy lifestyles and sustainable livelihoods...|$|E
40|$|Faith {{can be a}} {{powerful}} force for positive development and social change, but as James (2011) notes, it is a highly flammable fuel that can also easily result in negative outcomes. The pervasive influence of religion in the lives of many gives it a unique ability to shape both individual and communal identities (perceptions of self and others). While religious identities can be an extremely positive force, they can also be used as a source for exclusive and intolerant attitudes, with a potential to feed nationalisms that become motivators or justifications for conflict. This is particularly true in tense multi-religious contexts where competing ethnoreligious nationalistic identities and historical claims are forced to coexist – especially for faith-based development agencies that relate to one of those identities. This chapter explores the work of a small local Christian <b>faith-based</b> <b>organisation</b> (FBO) working in Buddhist communities in a region of significant Buddhist–Muslim tension and recent violent communal conflict, as a case study of development across complex faith boundaries. Local FBO Bethel works in partnership with the international FBO GraceWorks Myanmar (GWM). Making this case particularly interesting, Bethel has evolved out of a related religious organisation that still maintains a mandate for preaching a contextual Christian message to Buddhists, and most of the local workers are converts from Buddhism. Given the most inflammatory religious sparks for worsening conflicts are widely regarded to be discriminatory practices and proselytism – or perceptions of proselytism (e. g. Clarke and Jennings 2008; Flanigan 2010) – this case study is interesting for the way these issues are handled. This chapter includes new research examining whether and how this FBO has been able to avoid inflaming tensions and has been broadly granted a social mandate to operate in Buddhist communities, even though it constitutes a third religious actor in a context of vitriolic interreligious conflict...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Pap screening, an {{effective}} method for cervical cancer prevention, is now supported by molecular human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. Recently commercialised preventive vaccines also provide new tools {{for the primary}} prevention of cervical cancer. To determine appropriate prevention strategies, the Health General Direction, Lombardy Region, funded a project that aims to characterize and monitor HPV infections and related cervical diseases in high-risk women. Methods/design VALHIDATE is a 5 -year multicentre open prospective cohort study. It will recruit 7000 consenting women aged 13 – 65 [*]years {{to provide information about}} the local biomolecular epidemiology of HPV infection and cervical diseases in high-risk women recruited from nine clinical centres and one <b>faith-based</b> <b>organisation.</b> The study will estimate the overall and type-specific prevalence of HPV infection and cervical abnormalities. It also aims to compare standard Pap screening with biomolecular screening, and to assist in the design of targeted regional prevention programs directed specifically at high-risk groups. Three groups of high-risk women: 1000 HIV-infected women (aged 26 – 65 [*]years), 1000 recent migrant women (aged 26 – 65 [*]years) and 3000 young women (aged 13 – 26 [*]years) and 1 control group: 2000 women (aged 26 – 45 [*]years) attending a spontaneous screening program, will be recruited. Sample sizes will be revised after the first year. Adult participants will undergo conventional cervical cytology, HPV DNA screening and genotyping. Paediatric participants will undergo HPV DNA testing and genotyping of urine samples. HPV DNA, cytological abnormalities and HPV types will be analysed according to demographic, epidemiological, behavioural, and clinical data collected in an electronic case report form. Overall and stratified prevalences will be estimated to analyse the associations between HPV infection and selected characteristics. Logistic regression models will be used to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios. Cox proportional hazard models will be used to estimate hazard ratios over time and between groups.

40|$|There is {{continuing}} interest in religion and spirituality in Britain, although membership of mainstream churches is declining. Perceived secularisation of contemporary British society, together with increasing competition from ‘New Age’ movements, is causing many churches to review {{their approach to}} mission. This study considers {{the impact of the}} Scottish Episcopal Church’s strategy, Mission 21, during 1999 - 2004, initially under the controversial leadership of Primus Richard Holloway. Its explicit aim was to create a ‘postmodern’ church, attractive to those ‘on the margins of faith’. The research discovered that managerial and sociological approaches alone are insufficient to understand meaning and change in organisations, and that unique insights into the cultural change process may be gained from understanding of psychological individual differences, both of organisations and their members. In this case the instrument used was the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and derived Keirsey Temperament Sorter (KTS). A case study approach was adopted to develop theory grounded in the data, collected from grass roots congregations in the shape of MBTI profiles of clergy and key players, and a repertory grid analysis of the clergy role; and at strategic level with a participant observation study. Clergy were expected to be spiritual enactors of worship, leaders and managers of resources, and, most importantly for congregational key stakeholders of all personality types, to minister to congregations’ emotional needs. This tended to inhibit their ability to drive through culture change. The Church’s culture appeared predominantly traditionalist, although there was also evidence of a more liberal and mystical strain. However, the aim by Holloway to attract the interest of ultra-liberals was seen to extend the Church’s ‘market niche’ further than could be sustained even in a relatively heterogeneous culture. The research indicated that change in a <b>faith-based</b> <b>organisation,</b> concerned with people’s deepest emotions and anxieties, cannot ignore individual differences at the expense of managerial factors when understanding of the former provides a unique insight into the change process.

40|$|Background: In 2007, the Tanzanian {{government}} {{called for}} improvements in its {{primary health care}} services. Part of this initiative was to accelerate the training rate for nurses qualified to work in rural areas. The {{aim of this study}} was to reflect on the issues experienced whilst establishing and implementing a <b>faith-based</b> <b>organisation</b> (FBO) nursing school and make recommendations for other similar initiatives. Design: This paper describes an auto-ethnographic case study design to identify the key difficulties involved with establishing and implementing a new nursing school, and which factors helped the project achieve its goals. Results: Six themes emerged from the experiences that shaped the course of the project: 1) Motivation can be sustained if the rationale of the project is in line with its aims. Indeed, the project's primary health care focus was to strengthen the nursing workforce and build a public–private partnership with an FBO. All these were strengths, which helped in the midst of all the uncertainties. 2) Communication was an important and often underrated factor for all types of development projects. 3) Managing the unknown and 4) managing expectations characterised the project inception. Almost all themes had to do with 5) handling conflicts. With so many participants having their own agendas, tensions were unavoidable. A final theme was 6) the need to adjust to ever-changing targets. Conclusions: This retrospective auto-ethnographic manuscript serves as a small-scale case study, to illustrate how issues that can be generalised to other settings can be deconstructed to demonstrate how they influence health development projects in developing countries. From this narrative of experiences, key recommendations include the following: 1) Find the right ratio of stakeholders, participants, and agendas, and do not overload the project; 2) Be alert and communicate as much as possible with staff and do not ignore issues hoping they will solve themselves; 3) Think flexibly and do not stubbornly stick to original plans that might not be working; 4) Be realistic and do not romanticise. Embarking on such a project was a timely response to the Tanzanian's government call for strengthening Primary Health Care and for rapidly accelerating the training of nurses able to work in rural areas...|$|E
