The result of the survey showed that 95. 7 % of caregivers followed instructions provided at the point of dispensing or as on label of product. Survey result showed that 56 % of the oral medicinal products have specific direction for usage while 73 % have the inscription “as directed by the physician”, either alone or in combination with specific <b>direction</b> <b>for</b> <b>use.</b> Medicines with delivery device as cup were 80. 94 % and those with teaspoons were 1. 79 %, while 17. 28 % do not have any form of delivery device. 53. 11 % of the medicinal products provided instruction for delivery of the medicines in “teaspoonful”, though they did not contain teaspoon or cups graduated in “teaspoonful” format.

40|$|The {{submitted}} diploma thesis undertakes {{problems of}} the entrance of Fire Rescue Service forces to the closed areas and objects. The theoretical part of the diploma thesis focuses on problems of Integrated Rescue System, shows its units cooperated during the actions with the necessity of {{the entrance to the}} closed areas and specifies legislation focused to this type of incidents. It names the ways of entrance to the closed areas according to possible fire-fighting accesses, admission port to the objects and their technical provision in case of defalt in rescue of people. The main part of the diploma thesis in theoretical part is shot to the specification of fire-fighting technics, technical and material means, used for emergency entrance to the closed areas at Fire Rescue Service Moravian-Silesian Region, Regional Fire Rescue Service Karviná. At the conclusion of the theoretical part there are the most important aspects of tactics of Fire Rescue Service forces in actions described, where they are obliged to open closed obstructions for the entrance and to enter the closed areas regarding to solve technical help, fires or rescue of people. Because Police of the Czech Republic is the component of the Integrated Rescue System it takes part in most cases of Fire Rescue Service´s actions. That is the reason why I introduced the tactics in the actions of Fire Rescue Service force relating to the Fire Protection, very interesting methods of entrance to the closed areas used by special Police force. In the practical part of the diploma thesis there are methods and ways of emergency entrance to the closed areas using modern methods and technical support. To explain described methods of entrance and making obstructions up, I used the experiences obtained during my professional Fire Rescue Service. After the analysis of the separate methods there is an evaluation of their implementation and risks or complications during the actions. All methods and ways of emergency entrance are illustrated by photos. Then there is a summary of events from 2007 to 2012 when I was included to Regional Fire Rescue Service in Karviná. This summary shows frequency of actions in entrance to the closed areas in Moravian-Silesian Region in 2012. Next there is an analysis of means of Regional Fire Rescue Service in Karviná, used for opening and entrance to the closed areas. The effect of the analysis is to detect facilities for effective implementation of actions. On the basis of results the optimalisation was suggested to guarantee preparedness for these actions. In conclusion a ?door and window opener? is designed, including the verification of functionality. The technical documentation and <b>direction</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> are in enclosures. In conclusion of the practical part of the diploma thesis there is a discussion and evaluation of all aims of the work as practical processes of emergency entrance of Fire Rescue Service (FRS) forces to closed areas, evaluation of different types of rescuing people, FRS data processing and designing of the ?door and window opener?. At the end of the discussion the exploratory question was confirmed which evaluated facilities of FRS for emergency entrance to the closed areas, their insufficiency or necesity of inovation and, of course, if the door and window opener suggested in this work will improve the entrance to the closed areas and the action standard...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I apply paleomagnetic {{techniques}} to paleoseismological problems. I investigate {{the use of}} secular-variation magnetostratigraphy to date prehistoric earthquakes; I identify liquefaction remanent magnetization (LRM), and I quantify coseismic deformation within a fault zone by measuring the rotation of paleomagnetic vectors. In Chapter 2 I construct a secular-variation reference curve for southern California. For this curve I measure three new well-constrained paleomagnetic directions: two from the Pallett Creek paleoseismological site at A. D. 1397 - 1480 and A. D. 1465 - 1495, and one from Panum Crater at A. D. 1325 - 1365. To these three directions I add the best nine data points from the Sternberg secular-variation curve, five data points from Champion, and one point from the A. D. 1480 eruption of Mt. St. Helens. I derive the error due to the non-dipole field that is added to these data by the geographical correction to southern California. Combining these yields a secular variation curve for southern California covering the period A. D. 670 to 1910, with the best coverage in the range A. D. 1064 to 1505. In Chapter 3 I apply this curve to a problem in southern California. Two paleoseismological sites in the Salton trough of southern California have sediments deposited by prehistoric Lake Cahuilla. At the Salt Creek site I sampled sediments from three different lakes, and at the Indio site I sampled sediments from four different lakes. Based upon the coinciding paleomagnetic directions I correlate the oldest lake sampled at Salt Creek with the oldest lake sampled at Indio. Furthermore, the penultimate lake at Indio {{does not appear to}} be present at Salt Creek. Using the secular variation curve I can assign the lakes at Salt Creek to broad age ranges of A. D. 800 to 1100, A. D. 1100 to 1300, and A. D. 1300 to 1500. This example demonstrates the large uncertainties in the secular variation curve and the need to construct curves from a limited geographical area. Chapter 4 demonstrates that seismically induced liquefaction can cause resetting of detrital remanent magnetization and acquisition of a liquefaction remanent magnetization (LRM). I sampled three different liquefaction features, a sandbody formed in the Elsinore fault zone, diapirs from sediments of Mono Lake, and a sandblow in these same sediments. In every case the liquefaction features showed stable magnetization despite substantial physical disruption. In addition, in the case of the sandblow and the sandbody, the intensity of the natural remanent magnetization increased by up to an order of magnitude. In Chapter 5 I apply paleomagnetics to measuring the tectonic rotations in a 52 meter long transect across the San Andreas fault zone at the Pallett Creek paleoseismological site. This site has presented a significant problem because the brittle long-term average slip-rate across the fault is significantly less than the slip-rate from other nearby sites. I find sections adjacent to the fault with tectonic rotations of up to 30 °. If interpreted as block rotations, the non-brittle offset was 14. 0 + 2. 8, - 2. 1 meters in the last three earthquakes and 8. 5 + 1. 0, - 0. 9 meters in the last two. Combined with the brittle offset in these events, the last three events all had about 6 meters of total fault offset, even though the intervals between them were markedly different. In Appendix 1 I present a detailed description of my standard sampling and demagnetization procedure. In Appendix 2 I present a detailed discussion of the study at Panum Crater that yielded the well-constrained paleomagnetic <b>direction</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in developing secular variation curve in Chapter 2. In addition, from sampling two distinctly different clast types in a block-and-ash flow deposit from Panum Crater, I find that this flow had a complex emplacement and cooling history. Angular, glassy "lithic" blocks were emplaced at temperatures above 600 ° C. Some of these had cooled nearly completely, whereas others had cooled only to 450 ° C, when settling in the flow rotated the blocks slightly. The partially cooled blocks then finished cooling without further settling. Highly vesicular, breadcrusted pumiceous clasts had not yet cooled to 600 ° C at the time of these rotations, because they show a stable, well clustered, unidirectional magnetic vector. </p...|$|E
