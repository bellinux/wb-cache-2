5|$|From 1350 to 1400—the {{period in}} which the poem is thought to have been written—Wales {{experienced}} several raids {{at the hands of the}} English, who were attempting to colonise the area. The Gawain poet uses a North West Midlands dialect common on the Welsh–English border, potentially placing him in the midst of this conflict. Patricia Clare Ingham is credited with first viewing the poem through the lens of postcolonialism, and since then a great deal of dispute has emerged over the extent to which colonial differences play a role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b> Most critics agree that gender plays a role, but differ about whether gender supports the colonial ideals or replaces them as English and Welsh cultures interact <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} the reason that there is a close relationship between psychology and <b>the</b> phenomena <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poems.</b> Therefore <b>the</b> {{research is}} intended to study the relationship between the psychological phenomena namely the layers of personality that happen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poems.</b> <b>The</b> study is also intended to find its contribution to character education in teaching reading to students of SMA. To focus the research, three basic problem statements are put forward, they are: 1) What are the causes of conflicts between the id and superego reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poems?,</b> 2) How are the conflicts between the id and superego reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poems?,</b> 3) How are the contributions of conflicts between the id and superego which are reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> to character education in teaching reading? Grounded on the problem statements, the objectives of the study are: 1) To find the causes of conflicts between the id and superego as reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poems,</b> 2) To find the reflection of conflicts between the id and superego <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poems,</b> 3) To find the contribution of conflicts between the id and superego as reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> to character education in teaching reading. This research is a type of descriptive qualitative research which is intended to analyze the clash between the id and <b>the</b> superego <b>in</b> Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening by Robert Frost, as experienced by a horse rider, and in Poor Soul by William Shakespeare, as experienced by a Christian. This study uses psychological approach and takes the psychoanalysis theory from Sigmund Freud. In this theory, there are three layers of personality, namely the id, the ego, and the superego. This theory is used to guide the analysis of conflicts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poems.</b> <b>In</b> this research, <b>the</b> researcher only uses sample which is taken purposively. The primary data of this study are taken from <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> based on <b>the</b> theory of the id and the superego. This research does not use the secondary data because this study only uses making conceptual coherence to ascertain the quality of the data. The instrument that is used in this study is <b>the</b> researcher. <b>In</b> this research, <b>the</b> process of analyzing the data uses interactive model proposed by Miles and Huberman. The research findings consist three results. First, the id and <b>the</b> superego <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> are represented by the speaker of <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> themselves, which is <b>the</b> horse rider <b>in</b> Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening, and <b>the</b> Christian <b>in</b> Poor soul. Second, the conflict between the id and superego in each poem is reflected in one event and in one character. <b>In</b> both of <b>the</b> <b>poems,</b> <b>the</b> superego becomes <b>the</b> winner <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conflicts against the id. Third, there are some values of character which are reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poems,</b> namely discipline, curiosity, friendly/ communicative, and responsibility in Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening, while in Poor Soul are religious, friendly/communicative, social care, and responsibility. The result of the study can be used by English teachers in their teaching literary research concentrating on the psychological phenomenon of poetry, also to instill the character education to the students through psychological phenomenon as reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poems.</b> It can also be used as a reference to other researchers who carry out a study on the psychological aspects of other <b>poems</b> using <b>the</b> same perspective and to other researchers who concern on the character education...|$|R

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> Hyndluljóð, Óttar's ancestry is recounted and {{information}} is provided about the gods.

5|$|Many modern {{scholars}} {{contend that}} the seemingly Christian nature of the poem is due to Virgil referencing Eastern oracles, {{which may have been}} influenced by Jewish texts and prophecies. For instance, Robin Nisbet, after carefully analyzing the work, ultimately concluded that Virgil probably appropriated some elements used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> from Jewish mythology by means of Eastern oracles, and later adapted them towards Western (which is to say, Roman) modes of thought.|$|E

5|$|A {{centre of}} {{religious}} discussions called Anubhava Mantapa ("Hall of experience") in Kalyani became the conclave where devotees gathered {{to discuss their}} mystic experiences. Here, they expressed their devotion to Shiva in simple poems called Vachanas. These were spontaneous utterances of rhythmic, epigrammatical and satirical prose emphasising the worthlessness of riches, rituals and book learning. Many of these poems are anonymous, but the authors are identifiable by the unique divine name of the god Shiva that is invoked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the {{relevant}} words are of slightly uncertain meaning, it seems fairly clear that Völundr {{is described as}} one of the elves in Völundarkviða. As his most prominent deed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> is to rape Böðvildr, the poem associates elves with being a sexual threat to maidens. The same idea is present in two post-classical Eddaic poems, which are also influenced by chivalric romance or Breton lais, Kötludraumur and Gullkársljóð. The idea also occurs in later traditions in Scandinavia and beyond, so may be an early attestation of a prominent tradition. Elves also appear in a couple of verse spells, including the Bergen rune-charm from among the Bryggen inscriptions.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem,</b> Eliot used terza rima rhyme {{in a manner}} similar to Dante. In a 1950 lecture, he {{discussed}} how he imitated Dante within Little Gidding and the challenges that this presented. The lecture also dwelt on keeping to a set form and how Dante's poetry is the model for religious poetry and poetry in general. Besides Dante, many of the images used in Little Gidding were allusions to Eliot's earlier poems, especially the other poems of the Four Quartets.|$|E

5|$|Dejection was a {{response}} to Wordsworth's Immortality Ode. It conveys feelings of dejection, expressed through an inability to write or appreciate nature. Wordsworth is introduced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> as a counterbalance to Coleridge; Wordsworth is able to turn his darkness to benefit and accept comfort. However, Coleridge cannot find any positive aspect to his despair, and is paralyzed by his emotions. The poem captures many of the feelings expressed in his earlier works, including his exploration of a problematic childhood and thoughts on his religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Family {{and family}} history also plays an {{important}} role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b> Eliot found information on his family from Sketch of the Eliot Family, which described how Eliot's family lived in East Coker for 200 years. When Andrew Eliott left, he disrupted the family history. Similarly, Eliot broke from his own family when he travelled away from his family, a family that he saw was declining. Within the poem, Eliot emphasizes the need for a journey and the need for inward change.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{literary}} critics see the poem as portraying women's ultimate power over men. Morgan le Fay and Bertilak's wife, for example, {{are the most}} powerful characters in the poem—Morgan especially, as she begins the game by enchanting the Green Knight. The girdle and Gawain's scar {{can be seen as}} symbols of feminine power, each of them diminishing Gawain's masculinity. Gawain's misogynist passage, in which he blames all of his troubles on women and lists the many men who have fallen prey to women's wiles, further supports the feminist view of ultimate female power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the comedic poem Þrymskviða, Thor again plays {{a central}} role. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem,</b> Thor wakes and finds that his {{powerful}} hammer, Mjöllnir, is missing. Thor turns to Loki, {{and tells him}} that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen. The two go to the dwelling of the goddess Freyja, and so that he may attempt to find Mjöllnir, Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak. Freyja agrees, and says she would lend it to Thor {{even if it were}} made of silver or gold, and Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> Gawain, {{when the}} Knight is beheaded, he tells Gawain {{to meet him}} at the Green Chapel, saying that all nearby know where it is. Indeed, the guide which is to bring Gawain there from Bertilak's castle grows very fearful as they near it and begs Gawain to turn back. The final meeting at the Green Chapel has caused many {{scholars}} to draw religious connections, with the Knight fulfilling a priestly role with Gawain as a penitent. The Green Knight ultimately, in this interpretation, judges Gawain to be a worthy knight, and lets him live, playing a priest, God, and judge all at once.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> Lokasenna, the half-god Loki angrily flyts {{with the}} gods {{in the sea}} entity Ægir's hall. Thor does not attend the event, however, as he is away in the east for {{unspecified}} purposes. Towards {{the end of the}} poem, the flyting turns to Sif, Thor's wife, whom Loki then claims to have slept with. The god Freyr's servant Beyla interjects, and says that, since all of the mountains are shaking, she thinks that Thor is on his way home. Beyla adds that Thor will bring peace to the quarrel, to which Loki responds with insults.|$|E
