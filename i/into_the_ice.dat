5|$|Historians have divided {{views on}} Stefansson's {{decision}} to leave the ship. Some of the voyage's survivors were critical of his seeming indifference to their ordeal {{and the loss of}} their comrades. He escaped official censure, and was publicly honoured for his later work on the expedition despite the Canadian government's reservations about its overall management. Although Bartlett was criticised by an admiralty commission for taking Karluk <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> he was hailed as a hero by the public and by his former Karluk shipmates.|$|E
5|$|Nafash was a zerg broodmother, {{and leader}} of the Nafash Brood. Hoping to make the Swarm {{stronger}} by evolving {{a way to deal with}} extreme cold, Sarah Kerrigan sent Nafash and her brood to infest Kaldir. After Kerrigan's deinfestation, Nafash sought to create her own Swarm. Shortly after setting up a hive, Nafash moved off <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> valleys. When the protoss struck, Nafash fell back to prepared positions. The protoss hunted her down and killed her.|$|E
5|$|Subglacial eruptions are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption characterized by interactions between lava and ice, often under a glacier. The nature of glaciovolcanism dictates that it occurs at areas of high latitude and high altitude. It {{has been suggested that}} subglacial volcanoes that are not actively erupting often dump heat <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> covering them, producing meltwater. This meltwater mix means that subglacial eruptions often generate dangerous jökulhlaups (floods) and lahars.|$|E
50|$|Eisriesenwelt {{was formed}} by the Salzach river, which eroded passageways <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mountain. <b>The</b> <b>ice</b> {{formations}} in <b>the</b> cave were formed by thawing snow which drained <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cave and froze during winter.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} of Antarctica receives very little precipitation, {{and that in}} the form of snow, and the continent is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. Therefore, Antarctica is not generally considered to have a continental divide. The Transantarctic Mountains divide <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> streams draining West Antarctica <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Ronne <b>Ice</b> Shelf, toward <b>the</b> Pacific and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Ross <b>Ice</b> Shelf, from those draining East Antarctica toward the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.|$|R

5|$|The babies {{discover}} a tiny lizard in Tommy Pickles' backyard {{that they are}} convinced is the offspring of Reptar, a fictitious green dinosaur and main character of many action movies of which the Rugrats are fond. After learning about the extinction of the dinosaurs, Tommy decides to return the lizard to Reptar just as his family has purchased tickets for a musical ice show based on the character. After Tommy's parents and grandfather have fallen asleep, the babies sneak <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> rink and present the lizard to Leo, the actor portraying Reptar, who coincidentally happens to possess a phobia of lizards. Stu Pickles, Tommy's father, sees the rugrats and must retrieve them from the ice rink.|$|E
5|$|The {{ranges of}} the American and Chinese {{alligator}} extend into regions that sometimes experience periods of frost in winter. Being ectothermic, the internal body temperature of crocodilians falls {{as the temperature}} drops, and they become sluggish. They may become more active on warm days, but do not usually feed at all during the winter. In cold weather, they remain submerged with their tails in deeper, less cold water and their nostrils just projecting through the surface. If ice forms on the water, they maintain ice-free breathing holes, {{and there have been}} occasions when their snouts have become frozen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> Temperature sensing probes implanted in wild American alligators have found that their core body temperatures can descend to around , but as long as they remain able to breathe they show no ill effects when the weather warms up.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 173, the Iazyges {{launched}} a raid across the frozen Danube, but the Romans were ready for pursuit and followed {{them back to the}} Danube. The Iazyges prepared an ambush, planning to attack and scatter them as they tried to cross the frozen Danube, knowing that the Roman legionaries were not trained to fight on ice, and that their own horses had been trained to fight on ice without slipping. However the Roman army formed a solid square and dug <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> with their shields, so that they would not slip. When the Iazyges could not break the Roman lines, the Romans counterattacked, pulling the Iazyges off of their horses by grabbing on to their spears, clothing and shields. Soon both armies were in disarray after having slipped on the ice, and the battle was reduced to many brawls between the two sides, literally tooth and nail battles, which the Romans won. After this battle the Iazyges, and presumably the Sarmatians in general, were declared the primary enemy of Rome.|$|E

25|$|The diver can use {{a weight}} harness, {{integrated}} weight buoyancy control device, or a weight belt with two buckles on it so the weights can not be accidentally released which would cause a run-away ascent <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> sheet.|$|E
25|$|Early human {{occupants}} of the archipelago when the land was locked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> age looked to the sea for their sustenance. At that time, Kodiak Natives (Alutiiqs) occasionally hunted bears, using their meat for food, hides for clothing and bedding, and teeth for adornment. Traditional stories often revolved around the similarity between bears and humans, and around the mystical nature of bears because of their proximity to the spirit world.|$|E
25|$|As glaciers flow over bedrock, they soften {{and lift}} blocks of rock <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice.</b> This process, called plucking, {{is caused by}} {{subglacial}} water that penetrates fractures in the bedrock and subsequently freezes and expands. This expansion causes the ice {{to act as a}} lever that loosens the rock by lifting it. Thus, sediments of all sizes become part of the glacier's load. If a retreating glacier gains enough debris, it may become a rock glacier, like the Timpanogos Glacier in Utah.|$|E

50|$|Research {{published}} in September 2009, demonstrated that some new craters on Mars show exposed, pure water ice.

25|$|Satellite radar {{altimeter}} measurements show that between 1992 and 2001 the Larsen Ice Shelf lowered {{by up to}} 0.27 ± 0.11 meters per year. In 2004, a report concluded that although the remaining Larsen C region appeared to be relatively stable, continued warming could lead to its breakup within the following decade. A large iceberg broke away in July 2017 but, although noteworthy, is most likely part of a natural calving process that balances inflow of ice from glaciers <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> sheet.|$|E
25|$|The first ICE trains {{were the}} {{trainsets}} of ICE 1 (power cars: Class401), which came into service in 1989. The first regularly scheduled ICE trains ran from 2 June 1991 from Hamburg-Altona via Hamburg Hbf – Hannover Hbf – Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe – Fulda – Frankfurt Hbf – Mannheim Hbf and Stuttgart Hbf toward München Hbf at hourly intervals {{on the new}} ICE line 6. The Hanover-Würzburg line and the Mannheim-Stuttgart line, which had both opened the same year, were hence integrated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ICE</b> network from the very beginning.|$|E
25|$|The Alpini, as well {{as their}} Austrian counterparts: Kaiserschützen, Standschützen and Landeschützen {{occupied}} every hill and mountain top around the whole year. Huge underground bases were drilled and blown into the mountainsides and even deep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> of glaciers such as the Marmolada. Guns were dragged by hundreds of troops on mountains up to 3,890 m (12,760 feet) high. Roads, cable cars, mountain railroads and walkways were built up, through and along the steepest of cliffs. Many of these walkways and roads are still visible today, and many are maintained as Via Ferrata for climbing enthusiasts. In addition, along the former frontline it is still possible to see what is left of hundreds of kilometers of barbed wire.|$|E

25|$|The {{ship has}} a massively built wooden hull {{designed}} to withstand being frozen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> and resist crushing. At {{the time of}} her launch Discovery was widely held to be the strongest wooden ship ever built. The hull frames, placed much closer together than was normal, were made of solid sections of oak up to 11inches (27.9cm) thick. The outer hull was formed from two layers - one 6inches (15.2cm) thick and an outer skin some 5inches (12.7cm) thick. A third lining was laid inside the frames, forming a double bottom and skin around almost the entire hull. This meant that in places the hull was over 2feet (60cm) thick, providing not only formidable strength but excellent insulation against the cold. The construction meant {{that it was impossible to}} install portholes (and fitting them would have weakened the hull) so the crew relied on 'mushroom vents' on the deck to allow air and light into the interior.|$|E
25|$|Riou {{positioned}} himself near the iceberg, and despatched boats {{to collect the}} ice. By the time the last boats had been recovered night had fallen, when a sudden fogbank descended, hiding the iceberg from view. Riou {{found himself in a}} dangerous situation. Somewhere to leeward lay a large mass of ice, concealed in the darkness and fog. He posted lookouts in the bows and rigging, and began to edge slowly forward. After sometime the danger seemed to be past, and the iceberg left behind, when at 9 o'clock a strange pale glow was reported by the lookout in the bows. Riou ordered the helm to turn hard a starboard, turning into the wind as a wall of ice higher than the ship's masts slid by along the side. It briefly appeared that the danger had been avoided, but as she passed by the Guardian struck an underwater projection with a sudden crash. Caught in a sudden gust of wind the ship reared up and swung about, driving the stern <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> smashing away the rudder, shattering her stern frame and tearing a large gash in the hull. Despite the seriousness of the situation Riou remained calm, using the sails to pull clear of the ice, and then taking stock of the damage.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{makes her}} {{debut in the}} first season episode [...] "Evicted!" [...] and initially functions as an trickster antagonist, forcing Finn and Jake from their home. However, as the series progresses, Marceline becomes a close friend to Finn and Jake. Several backstory episodes have established that she was born to an unnamed human mother (voiced by Rebecca Sugar) and the demon Hunson Abadeer (voiced by Olivia's real-life father, Martin Olson).

500|$|The {{prevailing}} {{public reaction}} to the disaster was one of shock and outrage, directed against {{a number of issues}} and people: why were there so few lifeboats? Why had Ismay saved his own life when so many others died? Why did Titanic proceed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> field at full speed? The outrage was driven not least by the survivors themselves; even while they were aboard Carpathia on their way to New York, Beesley and other survivors determined to [...] "awaken public opinion to safeguard ocean travel in the future" [...] and wrote a public letter to The Times urging changes to maritime safety laws.|$|E

500|$|Bartlett, {{celebrated as}} a hero by press and public, was honoured for [...] "outstanding bravery" [...] by the Royal Geographical Society. However, he was later censured by an {{admiralty}} commission for taking Karluk <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> and for allowing Mackay's party to leave the main group—despite the letter that Mackay and the others had signed, absolving the captain from responsibility. Stefansson, too, was privately critical of Bartlett's conduct. Bartlett resumed his career at sea, {{and over the next}} 30 years led many more excursions to the Arctic. During the Second World War he carried out surveying and supply work for the Allies; he died, aged 70, in April 1946. His account of the Karluk disaster, published in 1916, makes no direct criticism of Stefansson or anyone else; Niven records, however, that to his friends Bartlett was highly uncomplimentary about his former leader.|$|E
