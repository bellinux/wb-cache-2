25|$|The NEMA 5-15 plug has two flat {{parallel}} blades like NEMA 1-15, {{but also}} adds a ground (<b>earth)</b> <b>pin.</b> It is rated 15A at 125 volts. The ground (<b>earth)</b> <b>pin</b> {{is longer than}} the line and neutral blades, so the device is grounded before the power is connected. Both current-carrying blades on grounding plugs are normally narrow, since the ground (<b>earth)</b> <b>pin</b> enforces polarity. NEMA 1-15 plugs are also compatible with NEMA 5-15 sockets.|$|E
25|$|The {{plug and}} socket are rated 16 A 250 V a.c. and are {{intended}} for use only on systems having nominal voltages between 200 V and 250 V a.c. The plug pins are 4.5mm in diameter, line and neutral are on centres 19mm apart. The <b>earth</b> <b>pin</b> is offset 3.0mm. The line pin {{is on the left}} when looking at a receptacle with the <b>earth</b> <b>pin</b> offset down. Shutters over the line and neutral pins are mandatory.|$|E
25|$|The {{unearthed}} type 21 plug has two rectangular pins, with centres 19mm apart. The type 23 plug adds {{a central}} rectangular <b>earth</b> <b>pin,</b> offset by 5mm.|$|E
25|$|This Danish {{standard}} plug {{is described}} in the Danish Plug Equipment Section 107-2-D1 Standard sheet (SRAF1962/DB 16/87 DN10A-R). Unlike the French CEE7/6 plug, the <b>earthing</b> <b>pin</b> is on the plug, not in the socket. The Danish socket need not be recessed to protect the <b>earthing</b> <b>pin.</b> The Danish standard provides for sockets to have child-resistant shutters.|$|R
25|$|CEE7/2 and 7/4 plugs are not {{compatible}} with the CEE7/5 socket because of the round <b>earthing</b> <b>pin</b> permanently mounted in the socket.|$|R
2500|$|The plug used in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga, Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea has an <b>earthing</b> <b>pin</b> and two flat {{current-carrying}} pins {{forming an}} upside down V-shape. The flat blades measure [...] and are set at 30° to the vertical at a nominal pitch of [...] Australian and New Zealand wall sockets almost always have switches {{on them for}} extra safety, as in the UK. An unearthed version of this plug with two angled power <b>pins</b> but no <b>earthing</b> <b>pin</b> is used with small double-insulated appliances, but the sockets always include an earth contact.|$|R
25|$|January 1957: BS1363:1947 Amendment 5, added clause {{permitting}} {{operation of}} shutters by simultaneous insertion {{of two or}} more pins (in addition to original method using only <b>earth</b> <b>pin).</b>|$|E
25|$|The type 11 plug is unearthed, {{with two}} 4mm {{diameter}} round pins spaced 19mm apart. The type 12 plug adds a central 4mm diameter round <b>earth</b> <b>pin,</b> offset by 5mm.|$|E
25|$|Another {{obsolete}} socket, made by Bryant, 125V 15A and 250V 10A rating. A NEMA 5‐20 125 V 20 A or 6‐20 250 V 20 A plug with {{a missing}} <b>earth</b> <b>pin</b> would fit this socket, but a NEMA 2‐20 plug is slightly {{too big to}} fit.|$|E
25|$|A third {{contact for}} a {{connection}} to earth is intended to protect against insulation failure of the connected device. Early unearthed plug and socket types were revised to include an <b>earthing</b> <b>pin</b> or phased {{out in favor of}} new earthed types.|$|R

From left to right, {{the metal}} disks are the {{insulated}} charge receiver A, the insulated charge transferrer B, the insulated charge accumulator C, and the earthed disk D. An <b>earthing</b> <b>pin</b> E makes {{contact with a}} wire F connected to B.|$|R
25|$|It has {{earthing}} clips on {{both sides}} {{to connect with the}} CEE7/3 socket and a female contact to accept the <b>earthing</b> <b>pin</b> of the CEE7/5 socket. Currently, appliances in many countries are sold with non-rewireable CEE7/7 plugs attached, enabling use in all countries whose socket standards are based on either CEE7/3 or CEE7/5.|$|R
25|$|Before the {{introduction}} of BS317, GH Scholes Ltd (Wylex) introduced (in 1926) an alternative three-pin plug. in three sizes, 5A, 10A and 15A with a round <b>earth</b> <b>pin</b> and rectangular live pins, a fused 13A version of this continued to be available after {{the introduction}} of BS1363, illustrating that BS546 was not used exclusively at any time.|$|E
25|$|The female XLR {{connectors}} {{are designed}} to first connect pin 1 (the <b>earth</b> <b>pin),</b> before the other pins make contact, when a male XLR connector is inserted. With the ground connection established before the signal lines are connected, the insertion (and removal) of XLR connectors in live equipment is possible without picking up external signals (as usually happens with, for example, RCA connectors).|$|E
25|$|NEMA 7 {{devices are}} 2-pole and ground {{connectors}} rated at 277V. The 15A 7-15 plug has the crowsfoot current carrying pins of the Type I plug, {{but with a}} U-shaped <b>earth</b> <b>pin.</b> The 7-20 version has an enlarged neutral pin. 7-30 is a larger diameter connector, with an L-shaped neutral, while the 7-50 has an enlarged neutral pin, compared with the hot.|$|E
50|$|It has {{earthing}} clips on {{both sides}} {{to connect with the}} CEE 7/3 socket and a female contact to accept the <b>earthing</b> <b>pin</b> of the CEE 7/5 socket. Currently, appliances in many countries are sold with non-rewireable CEE 7/7 plugs attached, enabling use in all countries whose socket standards are based on either CEE 7/3 or CEE 7/5.|$|R
25|$|Some {{of these}} sockets {{have one or}} more earth holes to allow 3-pin plugs. On {{properly}} wired circuits, the earth contact will be connected to earth. However, they cannot provide earthing to all types of plugs, {{as is the case}} of Schuko (which requires recessed sockets containing side earthing contacts) and French plugs (which require an <b>earthing</b> <b>pin</b> projecting from the socket).|$|R
50|$|There are {{unearthed}} {{versions of}} the plug used with this outlet having only the two flat inverted V-aligned <b>pins,</b> without the <b>Earthing</b> <b>pin.</b> Such plugs are only {{to be used for}} devices where other safety standards are in use (e.g. double insulation) and these plugs are rated at a maximum of only 7.5 amps. They are not available separately but only integrally with power cords specifically designed for the purpose.|$|R
25|$|Few private {{houses in}} Brazil have an earthed supply, {{so even if}} a three-pin socket is present it is not {{safe to assume that}} all three {{terminals}} are actually connected. Most large domestic appliances were sold with the option to fit a flying earth tail to be locally earthed, but many consumers were unsure how to use this and so didn't connect it. The new standard has an <b>earth</b> <b>pin,</b> which in theory eliminates the need for the flying earth tail.|$|E
25|$|Several {{manufacturers}} have made deliberately incompatible variants for use where connection with standard plugs is not acceptable. Common uses include filtered supplies for computer equipment and cleaners' supplies in public buildings and areas (to prevent visitors plugging in unauthorised equipment). Examples are one design made by MK {{which has a}} T-shaped <b>earth</b> <b>pin,</b> and the Walsall Gauge 13A plug, which has each pin rotated 90°, the latter being in use on parts of the London Underground for 110V AC supply. and also in some British Rail offices for filtered computer supplies.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{standard}} BS1363 plugs {{found in the}} UK, the <b>earth</b> <b>pin</b> is on a horizontal axis and the line and neutral pins on a vertical axis. This style of plug/socket was used by university laboratories (from batteries) and the BBC, and is still in use on parts of the London Underground for 110 V AC voltage supply. In the 1960s they were used for 240 V DC in the Power laboratory of the Electrical Engineering department of what was then University College, Cardiff. Power was supplied by the public 240 V DC mains which remained available {{in addition to the}} 240 V AC mains until circa 1969, and thereafter from in-house rectifiers. They were also used in the Ministry of Defence Main Building on circuits powered from the standby generators to stop staff from plugging in unauthorised devices, e.g. kettles. They were also known to be used in some British Rail offices for the same reason.|$|E
2500|$|The {{plug and}} socket used in Class1 {{applications}} in Argentina is defined by IRAM. The applicable standards are: IRAM 2073 [...] "Two pole plugs with earthing contact for domestic and similar purposes, rated 10 A and 20 A, 250 V AC" [...] and IRAM 2071 [...] "Two pole socket—outlets with earthing contact for 10 A and 20 A, 250 V AC., for fixed installations." [...] It is similar in appearance to the Australasian and Chinese plugs. It has an <b>earthing</b> <b>pin</b> and two flat current-carrying pins forming an upside down V-shape (120°). The flat blades for the 10 A version measure [...] and [...] for the 20 A version, and are set at 30° to the vertical at a nominal pitch of [...] The pin length {{is the same as}} in the Chinese version. The <b>earthing</b> <b>pin</b> length is [...] for the 10 A version and [...] for the 20 A version. The poles plugs length is [...] for the 10 A version and [...] for the 20 A version. The most important difference from the Australian plug is that the Argentinian plug is wired with the line and neutral contacts reversed.|$|R
2500|$|BS 546, [...] "Two-pole and earthing-pin plugs, {{socket-outlet}}s and socket-outlet adaptors for AC (50-60Hz) circuits up to 250V" [...] describes four {{sizes of}} plug rated at 2A, 5A (Type D), 15A (Type M) and 30A. The plugs have three round pins {{arranged in a}} triangle, with the larger top <b>pin</b> being the <b>earthing</b> <b>pin.</b> The plugs are polarized and unfused. Plugs are non-interchangeable between current ratings. Introduced in 1934, the BS 546 type has mostly been displaced in the UK by plugs and sockets to the BS 1363 standard. According to the IEC some 40 countries use Type D and 15 countries use Type M. Some, such as India and South Africa, use standards based on BS 546.|$|R

25|$|The {{standard}} for Chinese {{plugs and sockets}} (excluding Hong Kong and Macau) is set out in GB2099.1‐2008 and GB1002‐2008. As part of China's commitment for entry into the WTO, the new CPCS (Compulsory Product Certification System) has been introduced, and compliant Chinese plugs have been awarded the CCC Mark by this system. The plug is three wire, earthed, rated at 10A, 250V and used for Class 1 applications; a slightly larger 16A version also exists. The nominal pin dimensions of the 10A version are: 1.5mm thick by 6.4mm wide, the line & neutral are 18mm long, and the earth is 21mm long. It {{is similar to the}} Australian plug. Many 3 pin sockets in China include a physical lockout preventing access to the active and neutral terminals unless an <b>earth</b> <b>pin</b> (which is slightly longer than the other 2 pins) is entered first. China also uses American/Japanese NEMA 1‐15 sockets and plugs for Class-II appliances. The voltage at a Chinese socket of any type is 220V.|$|E
25|$|Thai Industrial Standard (TIS) 166-2547 and its {{subsequent}} update TIS 166-2549 replaced prior standards which {{were based on}} NEMA 1-15 and 5-15, as Thailand uses 220 V electricity. The plug has two round power pins 4.8mm in diameter and 19mm in length, insulated for 10mm and spaced 19mm apart, with an earthing pin of the same diameter and 21.4mm in length, located 11.89mm from the line connecting the two power pins. The <b>earth</b> <b>pin</b> spacing corresponds to that of NEMA 5 and provides compatibility with prior hybrid three-pin sockets, which accept NEMA 1-15, NEMA 5-15 and Europlugs, {{all of which have}} been variably used in Thailand. The hybrid socket is also defined in TIS 166-2547, in addition to a plain three-round-pin socket, with plans to replace the former and phase out support for NEMA-compatible plugs. Sockets are polarised (as in NEMA 5-15). The plug is similar to, but not interchangeable with, the Israeli SI32 plug. The Thai plug has not been designated with a letter code at IEC World Plugs.|$|E
2500|$|A BS1363 plug has two horizontal, {{rectangular}} pins for [...] and neutral, {{and above}} these pins, a larger, vertical pin for an earth connection. [...] Note, both line and neutral carry current and {{are defined as}} live parts. [...] The <b>earth</b> <b>pin</b> also serves to operate the basic shutter mechanism used in many sockets. [...] Correct polarity is established by {{the position of the}} <b>earth</b> <b>pin</b> relative to the other two pins, ensuring that the [...] pin is connected to the correct terminal in the socket-outlet.

2500|$|Design {{features}} of {{plugs and sockets}} have gradually developed {{to reduce the risk}} of electric shock and fire. Safety measures may include pin and slot dimensions and layout that permit only proper insertion of plug into socket, and <b>earth</b> <b>pins</b> designed such that the device becomes earthed before power is connected. Shutters that open only for the correct plug prevent foreign objects from contacting live slots. According to British author John Mellanby the first shuttered socket was introduced by British manufacturer Crompton in 1893. [...] Electrical insulation of the pin shanks was added to some designs, to reduce live contact exposure when a plug is partially inserted in a socket, Mellanby shows such a plug from British manufacturer Diamond [...] "H" [...] dated 1905.

40|$|In {{yet another}} {{approach}} to Paleozoic platforms, this study takes a restricted time slice and compares the cycle patterns {{in two different}} platforms: the Middle Appala-chians of Eastern North America, and the Great Basin on the Western side. Shoal-water emergence cycles and ramp cycles are dif-ferentiated, and time-subsidence plots provide a way of comparing the histories. Forward computer-modelling can be designed to produce somewhat similar sequences. The facies patterns and cycle patterns of these platforms differ markedly {{from those of the}} Early Carboniferous and those of the Triassic. The periodicities have not been established owing to the great uncertainties of stage durations. In addition, frequency ratios, so helpful in the Mesozoic, are not readi-ly applicable to these early Paleozoic times inasmuch as the precessional nd obliquity frequencies were probably considerably higher than those prevailing now, whereas the eccentricity frequencies have probably not changed. Such differences might in the future allow a better ap-proach to the problem of deceleration of the <b>earth's</b> <b>pin</b> rate, but this will require cleaner cyclicity data than are now available...|$|R
