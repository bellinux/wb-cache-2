40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Language and Literacy Education, Washington State UniversityTo {{respond to}} market demand, many {{universities}} in Taiwan offer online English courses. The literature indicates that students' satisfaction with online {{learning is a}} predictor of course dropout rate and intention to enroll in future online courses. This study identified factors that influence <b>EFL</b> online <b>learner</b> satisfaction, including flow experience, need satisfaction, perceptual learning style preferences, and EFL self-efficacy, and determined whether flow experience serves as a mediator between online learner satisfaction and need satisfaction, perceptual learning style preferences, and EFL self-efficacy. A total of 498 students at a university in Taiwan completed a questionnaire that consisted of Flow Experience Scale, Need Satisfaction Scale, Perceptual Learning Style Preference Questionnaire, EFL Self-Efficacy Scale, and Online Learner Satisfaction Questionnaire. Simple and multiple regression were employed in the analysis. Results indicated that (a) participants' flow experience had {{a positive effect on}} <b>EFL</b> online <b>learner</b> satisfaction, (b) participants with the highest levels of <b>EFL</b> online <b>learner</b> satisfaction tended to have high levels of {{at least one of the}} following characteristics: competence, autonomy, or relatedness need satisfaction; (c) participants with the highest levels of <b>EFL</b> online <b>learner</b> satisfaction also tended to have high levels of at least one of the following characteristics: group, individual, auditory, visual, or tactile learning style preference; (d) participants with high levels of listening or reading self-efficacy were more likely to have high levels of <b>EFL</b> online <b>learner</b> satisfaction; (e) flow experience and need satisfaction appear to be more important than are learning styles and language self-efficacy in determining <b>EFL</b> online <b>learner</b> satisfaction; and (f) flow experience is a partial mediator of five links: autonomy and <b>EFL</b> online <b>learner</b> satisfaction, competence and <b>EFL</b> online <b>learner</b> satisfaction, relatedness and <b>EFL</b> online <b>learner</b> satisfaction, auditory preference and <b>EFL</b> online <b>learner</b> satisfaction, and listening self-efficacy and <b>EFL</b> online <b>learner</b> satisfaction.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to investigate}} the relationship between L 2 acquisition and {{the involvement of the}} principles of Universal Grammar (UG) by Japanese <b>EFL</b> <b>learners.</b> In previous studies, there are three hypotheses on the relationship between them; (i) the No UG Access Hypothesis, (ii) the Full UG Access Hypothesis, and (iii) the Transfer Hypothesis. To investigate which hypothesis is supported by data from Japanese <b>EFL</b> <b>learners,</b> I focused on the wh-movement operation in English, which Japanese does not have overtly. There are two research questions. One is to investigate whether syntactic asymmetries affect the acquisition of the wh-movement operation by Japanese <b>EFL</b> <b>learners.</b> The other is to investigate whether the UG principles are active for the wh-movement operation by Japanese <b>EFL</b> <b>learners.</b> To address these research questions, I conducted (i) an interrogative formation test, (ii) a translation test, and (iii) a grammaticality judgment test, to Japanese <b>EFL</b> <b>learners,</b> and obtained the following results. First, I focused on junior high school <b>EFL</b> <b>learners,</b> who typically learn the wh-movement operation for the first time, and examined the acquisition of the wh-interrogative construction with short distance wh-movement. I found that the Japanese <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> showed (i) two types of argument/adjunct asymmetries and (ii) two types of subject/object asymmetries in the level of acquisition. Second, I verified whether these asymmetries are a general tendency for Japanese <b>EFL</b> <b>learners,</b> using Japanese college and university <b>EFL</b> <b>learners.</b> I found that the Japanese <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> showed (i) an argument/adjunct asymmetry and (ii) two types of subject/object asymmetries in the level of acquisition of the short distance wh-movement operation. Third, I focused on the wh-interrogative construction with long distance wh-movement, and investigated whether Japanese <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> would show the that-trace effect. I found that only advanced level learners showed this effect. Thus, for the advanced level learners, theEmpty Category Principle (ECP), which is assumed to be part of UG, is active in the acquisition of wh-interrogatives with long distance wh-movement. Fourth, I compared the result of the Japanese <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> with other Asian (Chinese, Korean, and Mongolian) <b>EFL</b> <b>learners.</b> These Asian <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> showed the same tendency as Japanese <b>EFL</b> <b>learners.</b> Thus, part of the UG principles is in operation for the advanced Asian <b>EFL</b> <b>learners.</b> Furthermore, I pointed out surprising that-trace effects by native speakers of English. There are three types of surprising that-trace effect: (i) the that-object trace effect, (ii) the that-adjunct trace effect, and (iii) the that-adverb-trace effect in English. Fifth, and finally, I focused on another type of wh-interrogatives, namely, multiple wh-interrogatives, and investigated whether Japanese <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> would show the superiority effect. I found that only advanced level learners showed this effect. Thus, for the advanced level learners, Attract-F, which is part of UG, is active in the acquisition of multiple wh-interrogatives. These results suggest that (i) Japanese <b>EFL</b> <b>learners</b> showed some asymmetries in their acquisition of the wh-movement operation, and (ii) part of the UG principles is active for the advanced Japanese <b>EFL</b> <b>learners,</b> while it is not for the beginner and the intermediate Japanese <b>EFL</b> <b>learners.</b> Given these facts, I conclude that L 2 grammar regarding the wh-movement operation in English by Japanese <b>EFL</b> <b>learners,</b> is constrained not only by L 1 knowledge, but also by UG. Therefore, the results of my dissertation support the Transfer Hypothesis rather than the No UG Access Hypothesis or the Full Access Hypothesis...|$|E

Subjects of the study included 50 novice male middle school teachers of English as a foreign language teaching in twelve middle public schools in Qassim region. Data were gathered using task-based self-assessment of classroom assessment knowledge and skills, thinking aloud protocol, and assessment training needs questionnaire. Besides, 150 language quizzes and assessment activities were analyzed in terms of a language test evaluation scale. Results revealed that training in <b>EFL</b> <b>learner</b> assessment at the graduate level appeared to be inadequate {{to meet the needs of}} novice EFL teachers who seem to acquire most of their knowledge of testing and assessment through the on-the-job experience, not through pre-service education at the university level.

The learner was exposed {{to a series of}} English sentences containing the target structures through listen-and-do activities. These activities required that the learner select different items based on the instructions given by the researcher. The exposure took place between 40 and 60 minutes in total spread over 3 days. In the fourth day, the learner was asked to give instructions (in English) to the researcher to select particular items. The learner’s task performance was then transcribed and analyzed using complexity and accuracy measures. The results indicated that comprehension-based lessons were effective in facilitating incidental acquisition the target structures for the learner...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of L 1 (Vietnamese) on L 2 (English) with a {{specific}} reference to rhythm. The transfer of L 1 rhythm to the L 2 rhythm is considered as a potential factor in reducing <b>EFL</b> <b>learner’s</b> intelligibility.   The findings of this quantitative research show that Vietnamese adult EFL learners’ oral output is significantly unintelligible due to the application the mid-level tone of their first language, part of Vietnamese rhythm to produce English rhythm in a pronunciation test, making their utterance monotonous. This paper aims at presenting findings gained from an examination into how the Vietnamese rhythm, the mid-level tone, affects 50 Vietnamese adult EFL learners’ intelligibility in a pronunciation test assessed by ten judges...|$|R
40|$|Many {{linguists}} {{agree that}} reading {{can have a}} positive effect on language learning, which has been demonstrated by a number of studies. This paper presents a case study in which the participant, a 14 -year-old <b>EFL</b> <b>learner,</b> read 15 graded readers of her choice in the course of two months. In order to measure the effect of reading, tests on reading comprehension, grammar and vocabulary knowledge were administered before and after the treatment. The results of the posttests showed that there was improvement in all three areas. Since the items of the tests were not taken from the books she read, the results show general improvement in these areas, which indicates that reading can contribute to learning different aspects of language and developing language skills...|$|R
