40|$|AIM:To {{measure the}} {{thickness}} of the normal levator palpebrae muscle by using ultrasound biomicroscopy(UBM) and to provide clinical guidance for the surgical treatment of blephamptosis. METHODS:Seventy-five cases(150 eyes) with normal levator palpebrae muscle were collected in our hospital. The normal levator palpebrae muscle was categorized into youth <b>group(aged</b> 20 ～ 39), middle-aged <b>group(aged</b> 40 ～ 59) and older <b>group(aged</b> > 60), 25 cases with 50 eyes in every group. The number of male was 30 (60 eyes) and the number of female was 45 (90 eyes). UBM was applied to measure {{the thickness of}} levator palpebrae muscle of each eye. The results were analyzed statistically and to see if the thickness might be effected by age or gender. RESULTS:The mean thickness of levator palpebrae muscle in youth group, middle-aged group and older group were 0. 833 ± 0. 054, 0. 723 ± 0. 021 and 0. 644 ± 0. 037 mm respectively. The mean thickness was 0. 748 ± 0. 100 mm in females and 0. 734 ± 0. 078 mm in males. By one-way ANOVA, the thicknesses of levator palpebrae muscle among the three different groups were different, and the differences were statistically significant(P CONCLUSION:UBM is a covenient,non-invasive test which can be used to measure {{the thickness of the}} levator palpebrae muscle. The levator palpebrae muscle becomes thinner gradually as aging, even without senile blepharoptosis, and the gender {{has nothing to do with}} the thicknesses of levator palpebrae muscle...|$|R

40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} the short-term effectiveness of orthokeratology(ortho-k) on controlling low-to-moderate myopic in Chinese children. METHODS: There were 271 subjects(271 eyes) enrolled in this study. In total, there were 141 cases aged 9. 43 ± 1. 10 in the ortho-k {{group and the}} spherical equivalent refractive errors(SER) were - 2. 74 ± 1. 15 D. The patients were examined at 1, 7, 30, and 90 d after they started wearing the ortho-k lenses. There were 130 cases aged 9. 37 ± 1. 00 enrolled in the control group, with the SER - 2. 88 ± 1. 39 D, and the examinations occurred at 6, 12 mo after they started wearing single-vision spectacles. Myopic progression was estimated from changes of axial length in both groups. The chi-square test, independent samples t -tests, paired t -tests, Spearman analysis were {{used to compare the}} data of the two groups. RESULTS: The axial elongation was 0. 27 ± 0. 17 mm in the ortho-k group after 1 a which was significantly longer than that before wearing(P P P t -test). There was significant negative correlation between axial elongation and initial age in both groups during the one-year period(ortho-k group: r s =- 0. 309, P r s =- 0. 472, P 0. 36 mm in 1 a) were 38 % in the ortho-k group and 76. 5 % in the control group, respectively; whereas those of the older <b>group(aged</b> 9. 4 ～ 12. 0) were lower, reaching 24. 3 % and 12. 9 % in the ortho-k and control groups. In patients with SER 5. 00 ～ 6. 00 D, the axial elongation in ortho-k group was 57. 1 % lower than that in control group. CONCLUSION: Ortho-k lens is effective to control myopic progression in children with low-to-moderate myopia. In particular, it reduces the percentage of younger children with fast progression and has a better effect of controlling myopic progression with higher degrees of myopia...|$|R

5000|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, Vienna was a {{metropolis}} in a country at the heart of Europe, where ten languages were being used actively. Starting from Vienna, the company opened up markets within and without the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. In rapid succession, Gottfried Schenker founded branches in Budapest, Trieste, Prague, Belgrade, Sofia, Salonika, and Constantinople. At that time, the distribution within the cities and individual regions was still carried out by horse-drawn coaches. Impressive warehouses, like the one in Vienna, acted as trade hubs. Consignments for longer distances were transported by rail. However, <b>groupage</b> transports across the entire continent or the transport of bulk cargo also required transport by sea. Anticipating further developments, Gottfried Schenker acquired interests in shipping lines. Starting from Trieste, he organized transports across the Mediterranean Sea, to Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and the UK, {{as well as to the}} United States. The company's ships with his own name, [...] "Gottfried Schenker" [...] and that of his wife, [...] "Betty", werecrossing the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the age of}} 30, Schenker {{together}} with two partners founded the freight forwarding company Schenker & Co on 1 July 1872 in Vienna. The managerial ingenuity of the Swiss-born entrepreneur was the introduction of <b>groupage</b> consignments by train. The idea to consolidate small shipments into larger units led to a completely new, reasonably priced and fast transport system by rail, road, sea, and inland waterways. The network of branches was expanding rapidly. At {{the end of the}} 19th century, Schenker already was the only enterprise offering tariffs calculated through from London to Istanbul. His successful approach—"house to house transport with one single forwarder"—soon made him market leader, as he was able to meet the requirements of his customers better and faster than all the competitors. The company has maintained this approach until today. A present-day historian wrote about Gottfried Schenker, who died in 1901, [...] "He {{was one of the great}} economic pioneers of the 19th century and became renowned far outside the borders of the Austro-Hungarian empire".|$|E
50|$|Currently, about 80% {{of cargo}} is {{deemed to be}} transshipment, while 20% is gateway (such as fuel, {{construction}} materials, agriculture products and so on). This percentage split is likely to change with the start of FTZ, envisioned {{to be similar to}} the Jebel Ali Free Zone (Jafza), UAE. With it, the new Port of Baku will act as a major logistics hub in Central Eurasia, serving both European and Asian markets, as well as being part of an extensive international logistics network linking Europe and Asia. In particular, Port of Baku will trade & become the major centre for consolidation, concentration and distribution, providing a wide range of value-added services in the region to the markets of the South Caucasus, Central Asia, Iran, southern Russia and Turkey. There are a significant number of activities that can be classified as value-added services in the field of logistics. Generally, they fall into two categories:• General Logistics Services, including storage, loading and unloading, stripping, unstuffing, <b>groupage,</b> consolidation and distribution.• Value-Added Logistics (VAL), including repackaging, customizing, assembly, quality control, testing, repair, on-terminal, auto-accessorizing, grain storage and fumigating, news print storage, storage of commodities and transfer and in-container garment assembly.General value-added services include services such as the maintenance, renting and leasing of equipment, cleaning facilities, tanking, safety, security services, offices and information and communication services of various kinds. VAL activities, in particular, are growing in importance as producers concentrate on meeting the demands of customers for high quality specialized products. New players in this field of third party logistics services providers will be attracted to the Port of Baku at Alat to take over parts of the production chain (assembly, quality control, customizing, packaging and others) and of the after-sales services (including repair and re-use).FTZ would be in a natural position to participate in this logistics niche. It will be linked to other Caspian ports via high quality maritime connections through the New Port of Baku at Alat, and intermodal road and rail transport services from Alat to Georgia, Iran, Turkey, Russia and southeast Europe, while also providing air freight services from Baku International Airport.The activity in FTZ will create an additional volume of cargo aimed at exports. The majority of these cargoes is likely to be transported in containers via the various intermodal forms of transport.|$|E

30|$|Logistics {{facilities}} that only deliver facilities belonging {{to their own}} groups: this is for example the case of <b>groupage</b> networks’ hubs (CLASS B), used as transshipment centers that link the different terminals of a same <b>groupage</b> network (though other <b>groupage</b> terminals can deliver both the network’s facilities and other economic activities and households), and of the retail distribution centers (CLASS Q and CLASS T), that only deliver the retail facilities of their groups (which {{is not the case}} of wholesalers’ logistics facilities and the distribution).|$|E
30|$|The {{location}} of hubs follows {{a totally different}} logic. The {{location of}} hubs is linked not to areas of delivery and pick-up but to the hubs’ position in the transport network. When observing the dispersion of the <b>groupage</b> transport hubs compared to the dispersion of the other logistics activities, {{we can see that}} hubs are the type of logistics facility that is the most concentrated but also furthest from the center of gravity of the City of Paris (Fig. 3). Half the <b>groupage</b> transport hubs of the Paris region are concentrated around the Roissy-Charles-de-Gaulle airport (in the north-east of Paris agglomeration), which is Europe’s busiest airport in terms of cargo traffic. 4 These hubs are used to link French (or European) road <b>groupage</b> terminals to all the other European (or Global) hubs of their networks, but also European (and Global) hubs with each other (this is the case for the FedEx facility, located within Roissy-Charles-de-Gaulle airport, and the biggest transshipment hub in Europe). With the notable exception of two hubs in the Gennevilliers river port (where large logistics facilities can be located close to Paris), all the other <b>groupage</b> transport hubs of the Paris region are located in the east and south limits of Paris agglomeration, next to the major highway interchanges, because of the location of the Paris region within the West-European highway network. These hubs are used to link Paris road <b>groupage</b> terminals (and international hubs) to all the French (and West-European) <b>groupage</b> terminals in their networks.|$|E

30|$|The {{location}} of a <b>groupage</b> transport facility depends {{on the kind of}} shipments it processes, and on its place in its network. While a small transport terminal delivering the outer suburbs of the Paris region and an international hub in Roissy-Charles-de-Gaulle airport may be operated by the same company, share the same NACE code and have essentially the same activity (transshipment), their roles in their respective transport networks are completely different, as are their potential for relocation, and the flows of goods they are generating. Considering the prominent place of this activity in urban logistics, public policy seeking to ensure the sustainability of parcels and isolated pallet deliveries at the local scale should consider the structures of the <b>groupage</b> networks that enable the sustainability of parcels and isolated pallets transportation at a regional, continental, or global scale. Given the concentration of activities in Paris (the localization of facilities delivering Paris and up to 20 [*]km in its suburbs), the size of Paris region (several transport terminals for each <b>groupage</b> network), Paris’s place in the French highway network (presence of regional hubs) and the European airport network (presence of global hubs), understanding the deployment of <b>groupage</b> transport networks in the Paris region requires taking account of all geographic scales, from the global to the local.|$|E

30|$|The {{structure}} of the French’s <b>groupage</b> service market has never stopped evolving since the late 80 s, following the changes in production and distribution patterns in Western Europe ([40 – 42]). In this paper, we divide the French <b>groupage</b> service market into two segments, according to size of shipment ([43, 44]): the small parcels segment, and the larger shipments segment. This segmentation is commercial (transport services are billed by parcel in the first segment and by shipment in the second) and operational (standardized parcels allow the automation of transshipment operations; furthermore, standardized parcels and pallets means easier handling of goods during transport and storage operations). <b>Groupage</b> transport companies are therefore specialized in either parcels transportation or larger LTL shipment transportation, and the facilities used for small parcel transshipments (here called “Parcels’ terminals”) {{are not the same}} as the ones used for larger parcel or pallet transshipments (here called “Groupage transport terminals”). At the same time, we chose to differentiate terminals from facilities used as hubs (here called “Groupage transport hubs”). Hubs are not linked with an area of delivery and pick-up but with a range of other transport facilities in their network.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{complexity}} and dynamics in <b>groupage</b> traffic requires flexible, efficient, and adaptive planning and controlling processes. While the general problem {{refers to the}} Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), additional requirements have to be fulfilled in application. Individual properties and priorities of orders, a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles, dynamically incoming orders, unexpected events etc. require a proactive and reactive system behavior. To enable automated dispatching processes, we have implemented a multiagent system where the decision making is shifted from a central system to autonomous, interacting, intelligent agents. To evaluate the approach we used multiagent-based simulation and modeled several scenarios on real world infrastructures with orders provided by our industrial partner. The results reveal that agent-based dispatching meets the in-creasing requirements in <b>groupage</b> traffic while supporting the combination of pickup and delivery tours and accommodating request priorities, time-windows, as well as capacity constraints.

40|$|Nowadays, freight <b>groupage</b> is {{a common}} practice, since it {{represents}} an effective method for achieving cost savings in collecting or delivering large product varieties in low quantities, by consolidating multiple consignments into one large transport load. Studying problems related to freight <b>groupage</b> is certainly a complex task, since it is influenced by many variables. Costs, for instance, are frequently linked to unplanned operational decisions made by operators on a daily basis, due to the constant presence of unscheduled requests or order changes. In this context, costs are difficult to control and manage. Authors propose a new approach for estimating costs, performances and resource utilizations by presenting a computation method capable of calculating transportation costs per delivery point. Cost allocation is achieved through a method of computation easily applicable to real world contests. Model results may also lead to create a dynamic system, enabling operators {{to be aware of}} the effects of their activity in real time. This way, they are constantly alerted and supported in their activities and in real-time decision making, gradually becoming aware of situations capable of creating additional costs and bad service. Thus, the model may both quantitatively assess the effects of the adopted transportation decisions and support in solving daily routing problems. Moreover, applying this approach, companies have major opportunities to improve margins and design new efficient distribution strategies...|$|E
30|$|<b>Groupage</b> {{transportation}} {{is defined by}} the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) 3 as the segment of the transport industry that deals with less-than-truckload shipments (less than 3 tons) in which transport services are divided in at least three transport operations, separated by at least two cross-docking operations. Shipments are collected at the sender’s facility and dropped in transport terminals by pick-up tours. In the transport terminals, they are consolidated into full-truck-load shipments for line-haul transport to another transport terminal, in which they are unconsolidated to be delivered to the receiver by delivery tours.|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis is devoted to traffic grooming, which is a central problem in optical networks. It refers to packing low-rate signals into higher-speed streams, in order to improve {{bandwidth}} utilization and reduce the network cost. The objective is to minimize the number of Add-Drop Multiplexers (ADMs), which are devices that insert/extract low-rate traffic to/from a high-speed stream. In graph-theoretical terms, the problem can be translated into finding a partition of the edges of a request graph into subgraphs with bounded number of edges, the objective being to minimize the total number of vertices of the partition. We first focus in Chapter 1 on a general request graph when the topology is a ring or a path. We provide the first inapproximability result for traffic grooming for fixed values of the grooming factor C, answering affirmatively to a conjecture in the literature. We also provide a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for traffic grooming in rings and paths, with an approximation ratio independent of C. We introduce in Chapter 2 a new model of traffic grooming in unidirectional rings, in order to design networks being able to support any request graph with bounded maximum degree. We show that the problem is essentially equivalent to finding the least integer M(C,D) such that the edges of any graph with maximum degree at most D can be partitioned into subgraphs with at most C edges and each vertex appears in at most M(C,D) subgraphs, and we establish the value of M(C,D) for almost all values of C and D. In Chapter 3 we focus on traffic grooming in bidirectional rings with symmetric shortest path routing and all-to-all unitary requests, providing general lower bounds and infinite families of optimal solutions for C= 1, 2, 3 and C of the form k(k+ 1) / 2. In Chapter 4 we study traffic grooming for two-period optical networks, a variation of the traffic grooming problem for WDM unidirectional ring networks with two grooming factors C and C' that allows some dynamism on the traffic. Using tools of graph decompositions, we determine the minimum number of ADMs for C= 4, and C'= 1, 2, 3. The study of the traffic grooming problem leads naturally to the study of a family of graph-theoretical problems dealing with general constraints on the degree. This is the topic of the second part of this thesis. We begin in Chapter 5 by studying the computational complexity of several families of degree-constrained problems, giving hardness results and polynomial-time approximation algorithms. We then study in Chapter 6 the parameterized complexity of finding degree-constrained subgraphs, when the parameter is the size of the subgraphs. We prove hardness results in general graphs and provide explicit fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for minor-free graphs. We obtain in Chapter 7 subexponential parameterized and exact algorithms for several families of degree-constrained subgraph problems on planar graphs, using bidimensionality theory combined with novel dynamic programming techniques. Finally, we provide in Chapter 8 a framework for the design of dynamic programming algorithms for surface-embedded graphs with single exponential dependence on branchwidth. Our approach is based on a new type of branch decomposition called surface cut decomposition, which generalizes sphere cut decompositions for planar graphs. The existence of such algorithms is proved using diverse techniques from topological graph theory and analytic combinatorics. La première partie de cette thèse s'intéresse au <b>groupage</b> de trafic dans les réseaux de télécommunications. La notion de <b>groupage</b> de trafic correspond à l'agrégation de flux de faible débit dans des conduits de plus gros débit. Cependant, à chaque insertion ou extraction de trafic sur une longueur d'onde il faut placer dans le noeud du réseau un multiplexeur à insertion/extraction (ADM). De plus il faut un ADM pour chaque longueur d'onde utilisée dans le noeud, ce qui représente un coût d'équipements important. Les objectifs du <b>groupage</b> de trafic sont d'une part le partage efficace de la bande passante et d'autre part la réduction du coût des équipements de routage. Nous présentons des résultats d'inapproximabilité, des algorithmes d'approximation, un nouveau modèle qui permet au réseau de pouvoir router n'importe quel graphe de requêtes de degré borné, ainsi que des solutions optimales pour deux scénarios avec trafic all-to-all: l'anneau bidirectionnel et l'anneau unidirectionnel avec un facteur de <b>groupage</b> qui change de manière dynamique. La deuxième partie de la thèse s'intéresse aux problèmes consistant à trouver des sous-graphes avec contraintes sur le degré. Cette classe de problèmes est plus générale que le <b>groupage</b> de trafic, qui est un cas particulier. Il s'agit de trouver des sous-graphes d'un graphe donné avec contraintes sur le degré, tout en optimisant un paramètre du graphe (très souvent, le nombre de sommets ou d'arêtes).

30|$|In the {{existing}} literature, investigations {{on the subject}} of the location of logistics facilities use various databases according to the scope of the analysis. Two kinds of data give us information on logistics facilities.

They usually rely on datasets that are built specifically for the research at hand (e.g. Dablanc, Andriankaja, (2011) for parcel’s delivery facilities in the Paris Region [7], or Verhetsel and al.
