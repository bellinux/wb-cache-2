40|$|This chapter aims at {{reviewing}} complex networks {{models and}} methods that were either developed for or applied to socioeconomic issues, and {{pertinent to the}} theme of New Economic Geography. After an introduction to the foundations of the field of complex networks, the present summary adds insights on the statistical mechanical approach, and on the most relevant computational aspects for the treatment of these systems. As the most frequently used model for interacting agent-based systems, {{a brief description of the}} statistical mechanics of the classical Ising model on regular lattices, together with recent extensions of the same model on small-world Watts-Strogatz and scale-free Albert-Barabasi complex networks is included. Other sections of the chapter are devoted to applications of complex networks to economics, finance, spreading of innovations, and regional trade and developments. The chapter also reviews results involving applications of complex networks to other relevant socioeconomic issues, including results for opinion and citation networks. Finally, some avenues for future research are introduced before summarizing the main conclusions of the chapter.

40|$|In {{the working}} {{paper we address}} the {{question}} whether the upsurge in <b>geographical</b> <b>economics</b> {{is related to the}} early works {{of the founders of the}} German school of regional economics. More specifically we examine why the German geographical economists were an exception of being a successful school in international mainstream economics, and why there was little competition between alternative schools of regional economics. We argue that the answer lies in the difficulties to combine <b>geographical</b> <b>economics</b> and the dominant economic theory of perfect competition. Much of the recent success of the New <b>Geographical</b> <b>Economics</b> lies in the fact that it is based on a model of monopolistic competition which sidesteps the problems that were posed by geography for the economics of perfect competition. The basis of this model of monopolistic competition provides, however, limited opportunity to pursue the research objectives of the German School of regional economics. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Geographical</b> <b>{{economic}}s</b> (also {{known as}} the new economic geography) is a recent approach developed within economics. It aims to provide a unified framework {{for the study of}} spatial agglomeration: the spatial concentration of economic activity. This search for unity stands in sharp contrast with the present plurality of approaches which seek to explain the same phenomenon across a variety of disciplines such as urban and regional economics, economic geography, and strategic management. More than any of the existing approaches, <b>geographical</b> <b>economics</b> has been contested by proponents of alternative theories. This dissertation investigates the general issues of unity, plurality and explanation by analysing them in relation to the case of <b>geographical</b> <b>economics</b> and its neighbours. Insights from the philosophy of science are employed to reveal the heretofore-unanalyzed rivalries and complementarities and to assess their potential for contributing to a unified theor! y of spatial agglomeration. The thesis is comprised of four independent essays that address these issues from diverse perspectives. In addition, a fifth introductory essay maps the common philosophical premises and outlines the overarching philosophical framework. In particular, insights concerning the partial and approximate nature of theories and the contrastive approach to explanation are brought together so as to individuate grounds for a realism-based pluralism. The contribution of this dissertation is twofold. First, the elucidation of inter-theoretic relations among <b>geographical</b> <b>economics</b> and its neighbours can foster enhanced communication among proponents of alternative approaches, and thereby theoretical progress. Second, in line with the current trend in the philosophy of science, the analysis of detailed cases of actual scientific practice carried out here is used to improve the adequacy of the selected philosophical accounts...|$|R

40|$|<b>Geographical</b> <b>economics</b> is {{a recent}} {{approach}} in economics aiming at introducing the 'role of space' {{into the mainstream of}} the discipline. Though interested in similar issues, economic geographers strongly criticise <b>geographical</b> <b>economics.</b> This paper puts such criticisms under scrutiny, taking Ron Martin's 1999 influential contribution as representative. A philosophically informed analysis of these criticisms brings forth possible misunderstandings in the dispute and hence assists both parties by making criticism and responses more incisive. If, as it seems at least in some geographers' view, economic geographers are concerned with mechanisms and processes different from the abstract general economic mechanisms analysed by geographical economists, then complementarity between the two approaches {{turns out to be a}} possibility. This challenges both economic geographers and geographical economists because it asks them to go beyond methodological differences and establish whether the general and abstract mechanisms identified by the latter are compatible with those identified by the former. If so, further investigation on how they combine as to bring about real-world agglomeration is needed. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{sets out}} to inspect empirically whether {{existing}} theory in <b>Geographical</b> <b>Economics</b> (GE) is able to provide a rationale for the controversial and much debated structure of the highly knowledge- and research-intensive biotechnology industry in Finland. In addition to providing evidence of GE in action, we integrate the effects that active public technology policy might have on geographic structures of industries into our analysis as a novel discourse. The results provide evidence of a theory based rationale that is able to deepen {{our understanding of the}} roles that different regions have enacted {{in the development of the}} case industry. Simultaneously, however, the rationale also reveals several challenges that different types of regions still have to overcome in order to steer on a track of sustainable economic development in the future. Based on the results we argue that public sector funding has enabled certain regions to develop in ways that otherwise would not be sustainable. <b>geographical</b> <b>economics,</b> regional agglomeration, regional specialisation, regional integration...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{key issues}} {{surrounding}} <b>geographical</b> <b>economics</b> is whether the theory can be made operational, so that proper investigations can {{be made of the}} basic theoretical assumptions and practical use can be made of the model's predictions at a detailed spatial level. In this paper the model formalized by Fujita et al. (1999) is developed in the context of 36 regions of Great Britain, enabling direct comparisons with observed wage rate data that are used to calibrate the model. Iceberg transport costs are {{in the form of an}} exponential function and a power function. For the range of parameters considered, the power function gives a better fit between model and data, suggesting scale economies in transportation. The paper shows that, in spite of the assumptions that have to be made, quite realistic distributions of relative wages, income and prices are attainable. However, caution is required in the interpretation of these simulations, which in no way provide proof of New Economic Geography theory, which clearly has limitations. Nonetheless it is hoped that the work reported in this paper does help to advance the progress of <b>geographical</b> <b>economics</b> theory towards empirical verification. ...|$|R

50|$|The term {{business}} cluster, {{also known}} as an industry cluster, competitive cluster, or Porterian cluster, was introduced and popularized by Michael Porter in The Competitive Advantage of Nations (1990). The importance of economic geography, or more correctly <b>geographical</b> <b>economics,</b> was also brought to attention by Paul Krugman in Geography and Trade (1991). Cluster development has since become a focus for many government programs. The underlying concept, which economists have referred to as agglomeration economies, dates back to 1890, {{and the work of}} Alfred Marshall.|$|R
40|$|This highly {{preliminary}} work attempts {{to study the}} multiple drivers of agglomeration phenomena in contemporary economies.

Third, we propose a simple model of firm agglomeration which is estimated on Italian data.

Moreover, we provide a simple necessary and sufficient condition for the spreading of economic activity to become more attractive, and thus more likely.

40|$|The paper {{opens with}} a {{statement}} on the social embeddedness of knowledge. The disciplinary situation and practices of economic geographers are reviewed {{in the light of}} this statement. The rise of a new <b>geographical</b> <b>economics</b> is noted, and its main thrust is summarized in terms of a description of the core model as formulated by Krugman. The geographers' reception of the new <b>geographical</b> <b>economics</b> is described, and some key aspects of this reception are assessed. I then subject the core model itself to critical evaluation. Its claims about pecuniary externalities in the context of Chamberlinian competition provide a number of useful insights. However, I argue that the model is deficient overall {{in the manner in which}} it tackles the central problem of agglomeration. The discussion then moves on to consideration of the recent interest shown by many economic geographers in issues of culture. After a brief exposition of what this means for economic geography, I offer the verdict that this shift of emphasis has much to recommend it, but that in some of its more extreme versions it is strongly susceptible to the temptations of philosophical idealism and political voluntarism. In the final part of the paper, I attempt to pinpoint some of the major tasks ahead for economic geography in the phase of post-'late capitalism'. I suggest, in particular, that a new cognitive map of capitalist society as a whole is urgently needed, and I offer some brief remarks about how its basic specifications might be identified.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a general equilibrium <b>geographical</b> <b>economics</b> model which uses matching frictions on {{the labor market}} to generate regional unemployment disparities alongside the usual core-periphery pattern of industrial agglomeration. In the model, regional wage differentials do not only influence migration decisions of mobile workers, but also affect the bargaining process on local labor markets, leading to differences in vacancies and unemployment as well. In a setting with two regions, both higher or lower unemployment rates in the core region are possible equilibrium outcomes, depending on transport costs and the elasticity of substitution. Stylized facts suggest that both patterns are of empirical relevance. Regional labor markets; New Economic Geography; job matching; unemployment...|$|R

40|$|Peaks and troughs in {{the spatial}} {{distributions}} of population, employment and wealth are a universal phenomenon {{in search of}} a general theory. Such spatial imbalances have two possible explanations. In the first one, uneven economic development {{can be seen as the}} result of the uneven distribution of natural resources. This is sometimes called "first nature" and refers to exogenously given characteristics of different sites. However, it falls short of providing a reasonable explanation of many other clusters of activities, which are much less dependent on natural advantage. The aim of <b>geographical</b> <b>economics</b> is precisely to understand what are the economic forces that, after controlling for first nature, account for "second nature", which emerges as the outcome of human beings' actions to improve upon the first one. Specifically, <b>geographical</b> <b>economics</b> asks what are the economic forces that can sustain a large permanent imbalance in the distributions of economic activities. In this paper, we focus on the so-called "new economic geography" approach. After having described some of the main results developed in standard location theory, we use a unified framework to survey the home market effect as well as core-periphery models. These models have been criticized by geographers because they accounts for some spatial costs while putting others aside without saying why. Furthermore, core-periphery models also exhibit some extreme features that are reffected in their bang-bang outcomes. We thus move on by investigating what the outcomes of core-periphery models become when we account for a more complete and richer description of the spatial aspects that these models aim at describing. We conclude by suggesting new lines of research...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{considers}} the ways geographers (proper) and (geographical) economists approach {{the study of}} economic geography. It argues {{that there are two}} areas where the approach of the latter is more robust than the former. First, formal models both enforce internal consistency and allow one to move from micro to macro behaviour. Second, empirical work tends to be more rigorous, emphasising the importance of getting representative samples, testing whether findings are significant, identifying and testing empirical predictions from theory and dealing with issues of observational equivalence. But any approach can be improved and so the paper also identifies ways in which geographical economists could learn from the direction taken by economic geographers proper.

40|$|Since {{its very}} appearance, {{probably}} due to its provocative name, New Economic Geography has stirred a debate on whether it is economic geography proper or rather <b>geographical</b> <b>economics.</b> In both cases, its real novelty has been questioned. We focus on this last issue. In particular, we argue {{that many of the}} NEG ideas have {{been around for a long}} time in the works of economic geographers and location theorists. However, NEG has the fundamental merit of having framed those ideas within a general equilibrium model encompassing most of these ideas. This has drawn economic geography and location theory from the periphery to the center of mainstream economic theory. More importantly, it has made already existing ideas more amenable to empirical scrutiny and policy analysis. ...|$|R

The {{thesis is}} above all {{an attempt to}} reconcile the latest in quantitative regional <b>economics</b> and theoretical <b>geographical</b> <b>economics</b> with qualitative methods of regional studies and economic geography. The research seeks a triangulation whereby the merits of both quantitative and qualitative methodologies can be appreciated within both theoretical and empirical contexts, without claims of the superiority of one approach being made. This is an ambitious objective and means that the research must {{be divided into two}} streams, one exploring each methodology and advancing research in those fields. Further, each methodology must be applied to the same area of study so that the results produced can be evaluated and compared. The thesis thus has three self-contained objectives that are part of this overarching aim. The first aim is to advance the scenario analysis methodology of considering the future to regional economic planning, and more generally to test the reliability and resilience of qualitative data in a rapidly changing economy. The second is to advance <b>geographical</b> <b>economics</b> (Krugman, 1991) in its discussion of the public sector as provider of public services and jobs, and to advance policy recommendations from the theory. The third aim is to use the geographical economic policy discussion and the scenario analysis to build a resilient economic policy for NorthWestWales from 2009, with resilient policy defined as a set of policies that can be applied in any foreseeable circumstance, so that policymakers can move seamlessly between individual policies within the policy framework depending on events.
