The card was sent all across the United States, as part of Wal-Mart's plan to rejuvenate the baseball card market. On February 24 of the following year, the 122nd anniversary of Wagner's birthday, the grand prize drawing for the card was held on CNN's Larry <b>King</b> <b>Weekend.</b> At around 9:00 P.M., Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson, one of King's guests on the show, pulled out {{the name of one}} Patricia Gibbs, a postal worker living in Hollywood, Florida. After spending hours unsuccessfully trying to contact Gibbs, King's staff finally got through to her phone, and informed Gibbs of her prize. Treat Entertainment and Wal-Mart gave the card to Gibbs a few weeks later at a Wal-Mart store in Miramar, Florida. Gibbs could not afford the taxes on the card, so she decided to consign the card to an auction later on.

50|$|The {{film was}} {{projected}} to earn around $20 {{million in its}} four-day Martin Luther <b>King</b> <b>weekend</b> debut. It faced competition from fellow newcomer Ride Along 2, as well as holdovers The Revenant and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Other films {{in a similar vein}} that had opened on the MLK weekend in previous years, American Sniper ($107.2 million in 2015) and Lone Survivor ($37.8 million in 2014), found success, although they had faced weaker competition, and were considered less politically divisive. However, The Hollywood Reporter noted that the film could outperform expectations if it was buoyed by waves of patriotism. The film made $900,000 from 1,995 theaters during its Thursday previews and $16.2 million in its opening weekend, finishing fourth at the box office.|$|E

5000|$|The album's lyrics deal {{mostly with}} birth and {{especially}} death. The opening track, [...] "Darkness", {{is a song}} about overcoming fears. [...] "Growing Up" [...] is a summation of life put to a pulsating beat. [...] "Sky Blue" [...] is a track Gabriel {{claimed to have been}} working on for 10 years before finishing it. The track [...] "No Way Out" [...] is the first track to deal with death solely, though death is a common theme across the entire album. [...] "I Grieve" [...] was conceived after Gabriel looked over his catalogue of music {{as if it were a}} catalogue of emotional tools. He found one major missing tool to be one to cope with death and therefore [...] "I Grieve" [...] was born. Gabriel performed the song live on the television show Larry <b>King</b> <b>Weekend</b> on the one-year anniversary of September 11 attacks in the U.S., during which Gabriel said that his two daughters were living in New York City and he could not contact them for some time, and that this song was for people who did not hear anything from their relatives then. It was not, however, written specifically for 9/11, having appeared on the City of Angels soundtrack in 1998 (in an earlier version) and performed live prior to 9/11.|$|E

5000|$|Despite being heavily {{associated}} with firearms in his Westerns and police movies, Eastwood has publicly endorsed gun control {{since at least}} 1973. In the April 24, 1973, edition of The Washington Post, the star said, [...] "Im for gun legislation myself. I dont hunt." [...] Two years later, in 1975, Eastwood told People magazine that he favors [...] "gun control to some degree." [...] About a year later, Eastwood remarked that [...] "All guns should be registered. I dont think legitimate gun owners would mind that kind of legislation. Right now the furor against a gun law is by gun owners who are overreacting. Theyre worried that all guns {{are going to be}} recalled. Its impossible to take guns out of circulation, and thats why firearms should be registered and mail-order delivery of guns halted." [...] In 1993, he noted that he [...] "...was always a backer" [...] of the Brady Bill, with its federally mandated waiting period. In 1995, Eastwood questioned the purpose of assault weapons. Larry King, the television host and newspaper columnist, wrote in the May 22, 1995, edition of USA Today that [...] "my interview with Eastwood will air on Larry <b>King</b> <b>Weekend</b> ... I asked him his thoughts on the NRA and gun control and he said that while people think of him as pro-gun, he has always been in favor of controls. Why would anyone need or want an assault weapon? he said." ...|$|E
