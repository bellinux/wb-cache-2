2500|$|The author went on {{to relate}} an {{incident}} in which he once heard [...] "a well known strain of music," [...] finding to his surprise that it was being sung by Black men rowing canoes. He claimed they were singing, [...] "Heigh Jim along, Jim along Josey, <b>Heigh</b> Jim along, Jim along Jo!" [...] The implication is that this song was similar to a sailor song, probably the well-known shanty, [...] "Haul Away, Joe" [...] or [...] "Haul Away for Rosie," [...] viz.: [...] "Way, haul away; O, haul away, my Rosey; Way, haul away; O, haul away, Joe." [...] The writer {{did not make a}} further connection to the minstrel song [...] "Jim Along Josey," [...] a relationship to which is obvious, although it is unknown whether this was the inspiration for the shanty or vice versa.|$|E

40|$|This {{data set}} {{contains}} measurements of plant height: vegetative height (<b>heighest</b> leaf) and regenerative height (<b>heighest</b> flower) in 2005 from the Main Experiment plots {{of a large}} grassland biodiversity experiment (the Jena Experiment; see further details below). In the Main Experiment, 82 grassland plots of 20 x 20 m were established {{from a pool of}} 60 species belonging to four functional groups (grasses, legumes, tall and small herbs). In May 2002, varying numbers of plant species from this species pool were sown into the plots to create a gradient of plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 60 species) and functional richness (1, 2, 3, 4 functional groups). Plots were maintained by bi-annual weeding and mowing. In 2005, plant height was recorded twice a year just before biomass harvest (during peak standing biomass in late May and in late August). For target plant individuals at 10 points separated by 1 m each along a transect in the central area in the plots, vegetative height (<b>heighest</b> leaf) and regenerative height (<b>heighest</b> flower) were measured as standing height (without stretching the plant). Provided are the individual measurements and the mean over the measured plants...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates windwave {{characteristics}} {{around the}} Ryukyu Islands (20 °N～ 35 °N, 120 °E～ 140 °E), using three different databases of wind velocity and windwave height; climatological dataset, ocean surface buoy dataset and satellite altimetory dataset. The yearly and monthly mean of windwave fields show the following characteristics. In winter the <b>heigher</b> wave height is observed due to strong winter northly monsoon. It brings that wave height {{in the west}} cost side of the Ryukyu Islands (East China Sea) is <b>heigher</b> than in the east cost side (Pacific Ocean). In summer the wave height of Pacific Ocean side is <b>heigher</b> than in the East China Sea side due to a long fetch from south along with sea swells. Along the satellite orbit (30 °N, 126 °E～ 24 °N, 129 °E) crossing the Okinawa Main Island we can examine more detailed wave height distribution changing with seasons. Wind and windwave fields derived from three databases are basically consistent with each other. Climatological wind velocities from spring to autumn, however, show slightly <b>heigher</b> value than the others. Climatological wave heights from autumn to winter show slightly smaller value than those of satellite. These facts will be caused by the difference of observational methods and data sampling conditions...|$|R
