5|$|Although <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> an ethnoreligious group, {{they were}} {{defined by the}} Nazis on purely racial grounds. The Nazi Party viewed the Jewish {{religion}} as irrelevant, persecuting Jews in accordance with antisemitic stereotypes of an alleged biologically determined heritage. Defining Jews as the chief enemy, Nazi racial ideology was also used to persecute other minorities.|$|E
5|$|Jerusalem bagels, {{unlike the}} round, boiled and baked bagels popularized by Ashkenazi <b>Jews,</b> <b>are</b> long and oblong-shaped, made from bread dough, covered in za’atar or sesame seeds, and are soft, chewy and sweet.

50|$|At Auschwitz-Birkenau over 1,000,000 {{people were}} killed. At Treblinka 870,000 to 925,000 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> murdered. At Bełżec, between 434,000 and 600,000 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> slaughtered. At Chełmno, between 152,000 and 320,000 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> executed. At Sobibór, between 170,000 and 250,000 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> killed. At Majdanek, {{depending}} on the various sources, between 79,000 and 235,000 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> murdered. For the death camps, 80-90% of the victims are estimated to <b>be</b> <b>Jews.</b> They accounted for half {{the total number of}} Jews killed in the entire Holocaust.|$|R
25|$|Throughout the 1860s, the <b>Jews</b> of Libya <b>were</b> {{subjected}} to what Gilbert calls punitive taxation. In 1864, around 500 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> killed in Marrakech and Fezin Morocco. In 1869, 18 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> killed in Tunis, and an Arab mob looted Jewish homes and stores, and burned synagogues, on Jerba Island. In 1875, 20 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> {{killed by a}} mob in Demnat, Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight. In 1891, the leading Muslims in Jerusalem asked the Ottoman authorities in Constantinople to prohibit the entry of Jews arriving from Russia. In 1897, synagogues <b>were</b> ransacked and <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> murdered in Tripolitania.|$|R
5|$|After {{some initial}} resistance, the Duke yields to Süß's {{request for the}} repeal of the law prohibiting Jews from living in Württemberg; a horde of dirty, disreputable <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> then shown moving into the city. Süß enables them to enrich {{themselves}} {{at the expense of the}} populace. The aged Rabbi Loew (Werner Krauss) criticizes Süß for his excessively opulent lifestyle as the Duke's finance minister and warns that it could be his downfall, warning that, “The Lord punishes Jews who forget who they are!” but Süß pays him no heed.|$|E
5|$|As the Allies {{prepared}} for the liberation of Europe, the mass deportations began {{at a rate of}} four trains a day from Hungary to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, each train carrying around 3,000 people. Between 15 May and 8 July 1944, 437,402 Hungarian <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> recorded as having been sent there on 147 trains, most gassed on arrival. The transports comprised most of the Jewish population outside Budapest, the Hungarian capital.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} bottom right corner, two Polish <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> {{on the edge of}} the scene; the younger (36) one is usually {{described}} as enthralled by the events, watching them with hope, but most analysis focuses on the older man (37), whose hand is making a Sy, git ("that's good") gesture. Interpretation of this figure varies; while some suggest that he express his interest and support for the Constitution, which he sees as a promise of further reforms that will improve the situation of the Jews—the Constitution had not addressed them in any significant way—others put him, or both of the Jews, among the opponents of the Constitution, describing them as frowning and disturbed, gleefully anticipating the end of the Commonwealth, or at least concerned with the liberal reforms. The latter interpretation can be also supported by the fact that Matejko tended to portray Jews in his paintings in negative roles.|$|E
50|$|According to the 1939 census, 102 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> {{living in}} Dukhovshchina. The <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> {{forced to work}} after the German invasion. The <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> {{gathered}} in a ghetto, which was liquidated {{in the summer of}} 1942. During this time, 300 Jews perished in mass executions perpetrated by an Einsatzgruppen.|$|R
5000|$|... 25 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> {{assigned}} to the unit as supernumerary policemen, all of them Haganah members.

Later, 50 more <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> {{assigned to}} the SNS, also from Haganah cadres.|$|R
50|$|During {{the third}} action, 1,000 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> sent to Belzec {{extermination}} camp {{and during the}} fourth action, 460 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> sent to Belzec. During the four actions which were perpetrated from August to October 1942, 5000 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> sent from Sambir to Belzec. The open ghetto became a closed ghetto in December 1942. Several actions {{took place in the}} ghetto from February to June 1943. During the first action, on February 13, 1943, 500 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> executed in the forest of Ralivka. On April 14, 1943, a second action was carried out during which 1,200 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> selected and 900 were shot in the cemetery.|$|R
5|$|Greater Manchester {{is home to}} {{a diverse}} {{population}} and is a multicultural agglomeration with an ethnic minority population comprising 8.5% of the total population in 2001. In 2008, there were over 66refugee nationalities in the county. At the 2001 UK census, 74.2% of Greater Manchester's residents were Christian, 5.0% Muslim, 0.9% Jewish, 0.7% Hindu, 0.2% Buddhist, and 0.1% Sikh. 11.4% had no religion, 0.2% had an alternative religion and 7.4% did not state their religion. This is similar {{to the rest of the}} country, although the proportions of Muslims and <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> nearly twice the national average. It contains the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation, a large Ashkenazi Orthodox synagogue located in North Manchester. Greater Manchester is covered by the Roman Catholic Dioceses of Salford and Shrewsbury, and the Archdiocese of Liverpool. Most of Greater Manchester is part of the Anglican Diocese of Manchester, apart from Wigan which lies within the Diocese of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann, later President of the World Zionist Organisation, {{moved from}} Switzerland to the UK in 1904 and met Arthur Balfour – {{who had just}} {{launched}} his 1905–1906 election campaign after resigning as Prime Minister – in a session arranged by Charles Dreyfus, his Jewish constituency representative. Earlier that year, Balfour had successfully driven the Aliens Act through Parliament with impassioned speeches regarding the need to restrict the wave of immigration into Britain from Jews fleeing the Russian Empire. During this meeting, he asked what Weizmann's objections {{had been to the}} 1903 Uganda Scheme that Herzl had supported to provide a portion of British East Africa to the Jewish people as a homeland. The scheme, which had been proposed to Herzl by Joseph Chamberlain, Colonial Secretary in Balfour's Cabinet, following his trip to East Africa earlier in the year, had been subsequently voted down following Herzl's death by the Seventh Zionist Congress in 1905 after two years of heated debate in the Zionist Organization. Weizmann responded that he believed the English are to London as the <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> to Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|The Western Wall is {{considered}} holy {{due to its}} connection to the Temple Mount. Because of the Temple Mount entry restrictions, the Wall is the holiest place where <b>Jews</b> <b>are</b> permitted to pray, {{though it is not}} the holiest site in the Jewish faith, which lies behind it. The original, natural and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger Temple compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by Herod, who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support extensive substructures and earth fills needed to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved esplanade which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one {{is considered}} to be closest to the former Temple, which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount esplanade. Just over half the wall's total height, including its 17 courses located below street level, dates {{from the end of the}} Second Temple period, and is commonly believed to have been built around 19 BCE by Herod the Great, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the Umayyad era, while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.|$|E

5000|$|In April 1942, the <b>Jews</b> of Osijek <b>were</b> {{forced to}} build a [...] "Jewish settlement" [...] at Tenja, into which they were herded along with Jews from the {{surrounding}} region. Approximately 3,000 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> moved to Tenja in June and July 1942. From Tenja, 200 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> transported to the Jasenovac concentration camp and 2,800 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp.|$|R
50|$|In {{frequent}} {{cases of}} blood libel, <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> said {{to hunt for}} children to murder before Passover {{so that they could}} use their blood to make the unleavened matzah. Anti-Jewish attitudes sparked numerous riots in which many <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> murdered, most notably in 1190, when over 100 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> massacred in York.|$|R

5000|$|There has {{not been}} a {{political}} unity of Jewish society since the united monarchy. Since then Israelite populations were always geographically dispersed (see Jewish diaspora), so that by the 19th century the Ashkenazi <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> mainly in Eastern and Central Europe; the Sephardi <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> largely spread among various communities in the Mediterranean region; Mizrahi <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> primarily spread throughout Western Asia; and other populations of <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> in Central Asia, Ethiopia, the Caucasus, and India.

5000|$|In 1840, the <b>Jews</b> of Damascus <b>were</b> {{falsely accused}} of having murdered a Christian monk and his Muslim servant and of having used their blood to bake Passover bread.

50|$|In January 1939, there <b>were</b> 1,693 <b>Jews</b> in the village. There was a Yiddish {{school until}} 1938. The {{majority}} of the <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> merchants.

The second execution took place on November 6, 1941. Some <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> sent to work and the remaining <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> gathered in a garage near the hospital. Germans took their valuables. The <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> then displaced near the airport, {{not far from the}} village of Dolgaya Gora and were shot by Germans and local policemen. On the same day, the <b>Jews</b> who <b>were</b> sent to work were shot at the same location. According to some sources, between 750 and 900 <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> killed on that day. After this massacre, 80 Jews remained alive. They were concentrated in one house. At the end of November 1941, these <b>Jews</b> <b>were</b> forced to walk to Melovaya Gora and were shot.
