5|$|The first metagenomic studies {{conducted}} using high-throughput sequencing used massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing. Three other technologies commonly applied to environmental sampling are the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine, the Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq and the Applied Biosystems SOLiD system. These techniques <b>for</b> <b>sequencing</b> DNA generate shorter fragments than Sanger sequencing; Ion Torrent PGM System and 454 pyrosequencing typically produces ~400bp reads, Illumina MiSeq produces 400-700bp reads (depending on whether paired end options are used), and SOLiD produce 25-75bp reads. Historically, these read lengths were significantly {{shorter than the}} typical Sanger sequencing read length of ~750bp, however the Illumina technology is quickly coming close to this benchmark. However, this limitation is compensated for by the much larger number of sequence reads. In 2009, pyrosequenced metagenomes generate 200–500megabases, and Illumina platforms generate around 20–50gigabases, but these outputs have increased by orders of magnitude in recent years. An additional advantage to high throughput sequencing is that this technique does not require cloning the DNA before sequencing, removing {{one of the main}} biases and bottlenecks in environmental sampling.|$|E

25|$|The Edman {{degradation}} is a {{very important}} reaction for protein sequencing, because it allows the ordered amino acid composition of a protein to be discovered.

25|$|Oxford Nanopore's MinION {{was used}} in 2015 for {{real-time}} metagenomic detection of pathogens in complex, high-background clinical samples. The first Ebola virus (EBV) read was sequenced 44 seconds after data acquisition. There was uniform mapping of reads to genome; at least one read mapped to >88% of the genome. The relatively long reads allowed <b>for</b> <b>sequencing</b> of a near-complete viral genome to high accuracy (97–99% identity) directly from a primary clinical sample.|$|E
25|$|The parking {{strategy}} <b>for</b> <b>sequencing</b> {{resembles the}} process of parking cars along a curb. Each car is a sequenced clone, and the curb is the genomic target. Each clone sequenced is screened to ensure that subsequently sequenced clones do not overlap any previously sequenced clone. No sequencing effort is redundant in this strategy. However, much like the gaps between parked cars, unsequenced gaps less than {{the length of a}} clone accumulate between sequenced clones. There can be considerable cost to close such gaps.|$|E
30|$|In recent years, {{some work}} has been done on the strong limit theorems <b>for</b> {{arbitrary}} stochastic <b>sequences.</b> Liu and Yang [3] established two strong limit theorems <b>for</b> arbitrary stochastic <b>sequences,</b> which generalized Chung's [4] strong law of large numbers <b>for</b> <b>sequence</b> of independent random variables as well as Chow's [5] strong law of large numbers <b>for</b> <b>sequence</b> of martingale differences. Then, Yang [6] established two more general strong limit theorems in 2007, which generalized a result by Jardas et al. [7] <b>for</b> <b>sequences</b> of independent random variables and the results by Liu and Yang [3] <b>for</b> arbitrary stochastic <b>sequences</b> in 2003. In 2008, W. Yang and X. Yang [8] proved two strong limit theorems <b>for</b> stochastic <b>sequences,</b> which generalized results by Freedman [9], Isaac, [10] and Petrov [2]. Qiu and Yang [11] established another type strong limit theorem <b>for</b> stochastic <b>sequence</b> in 1999. Then, Wang and Guo [12] extended the main result of Qiu and Yang in 2009. In addition, Wang and Yang [13] established a strong limit theorem <b>for</b> arbitrary stochastic <b>sequences</b> in 2005, which generalized Chow's [5] series convergence theorem <b>for</b> <b>sequence</b> of martingale differences.

The major carbohydrate sequence linked to glycodelin-A also profusely coats the surface of schistosomes. The profile of the major oligosaccharides linked to CA125 and the major surface glycoprotein of HIV-1 (gp120) almost perfectly overlap. More persistent pathogens linked to the eu-FEDS model may be identified as mass spectrometry methods <b>for</b> <b>sequencing</b> oligosaccharides become more sensitive.|$|E
25|$|PCR has {{a number}} of advantages. It is fairly simple to {{understand}} and to use, and produces results rapidly. The technique is highly sensitive with the potential to produce millions to billions of copies of a specific product <b>for</b> <b>sequencing,</b> cloning, and analysis. qRT-PCR shares the same advantages as the PCR, with an added advantage of quantification of the synthesized product. Therefore, it has its uses to analyze alterations of gene expression levels in tumors, microbes, or other disease states.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{sequencing}} methods usually sequence {{both ends}} of a larger fragment, which provides linking information for de novo assembly and improved probabilities for alignment to reference sequence. Researchers generally believe that longer lengths of data (read lengths) enhance performance for very large DNA targets, an idea consistent with predictions from distribution models. However, Wendl showed that smaller fragments provide better coverage on small, linear targets because they reduce the edge effect in linear molecules. These findings have implications <b>for</b> <b>sequencing</b> the products of DNA filtering procedures. Read-pairing and fragment size evidently have negligible influence for large, whole-genome class targets.|$|E

25|$|Developed in 1983 by Kary Mullis, PCR is now {{a common}} and often {{indispensable}} technique used in clinical and research laboratories for a broad variety of applications. These include DNA cloning <b>for</b> <b>sequencing,</b> gene cloning and manipulation, gene mutagenesis; construction of DNA-based phylogenies, or functional analysis of genes; diagnosis and monitoring of hereditary diseases; amplification of ancient DNA; analysis of genetic fingerprints for DNA profiling (for example, in forensic science and parentage testing); and detection of pathogens in nucleic acid tests for the diagnosis of infectious diseases.

25|$|The {{public sector}} effort {{continues}} {{with the goal}} to create a high-quality, draft genome sequence from reads generated by all sources. The public-sector effort has generated Sanger reads of BACs, fosmids, and plasmids as well as 454 reads. These later types of reads will be instrumental in assembling an initial draft of the D genome. In 2010, two companies (Monsanto and Illumina), completed enough Illumina sequencing to cover the D genome of G. raimondii about 50x. They announced that they would donate their raw reads to the public. This public relations effort gave them some recognition <b>for</b> <b>sequencing</b> the cotton genome. Once the D genome is assembled {{from all of this}} raw material, it will undoubtedly assist in the assembly of the AD genomes of cultivated varieties of cotton, but {{a lot of hard work}} remains.|$|E
25|$|During {{preparation}} <b>for</b> <b>sequencing,</b> cDNA {{copies of}} transcripts may be amplified by PCR to enrich for fragments that contain the expected 5’ and 3’ adapter sequences. Amplification {{is also used}} to allow sequencing of very low input amounts of RNA, down to as little as 50 pg, in extreme applications. Spike-in controls can be used to provide quality control assessment of library preparation and sequencing, in terms of GC-content, fragment length, as well as the bias due to fragment position within a transcript. Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) are short random sequences that are used to individually tag sequence fragments during library preparation, so that every tagged fragment is unique. UMIs provide an absolute scale for quantification and the opportunity to correct for subsequent amplification bias introduced during library construction, and accurately estimate the initial sample size. UMIs are particularly well suited to single-cell RNA-Seq transcriptomics, where the amount of input RNA is restricted and extended amplification of the sample is required.|$|E

25|$|Motor {{planning}} {{is an important}} component of becoming a fluent semantic compaction user. Icon sequencing should be the initial focus of learning to use semantic compaction devices. A beginner needs to be fluent in a given icon set before progressing to a more advanced level. The Language Acquisition through Motor Planning (LAMP) strategy aids individuals in developing motor plans <b>for</b> <b>sequencing</b> icons for messages. Minspeak relies upon the motor-based learning principles that when motor patterns are repeated, these processes become automatic and simplified. Common automated motor patterns include typing on a keyboard without looking, riding a bicycle, or swallowing food and drink. Increased automaticity and simplification with the production of language allows experienced Minspeak users to delegate cognitive attention to their intended message (language) instead of to the formulation of their message. This allows users to focus on communicating a specific message rather than focus on how to build the message by searching for icons across different pages and or screens. The use of LAMP strategies has been associated with increased natural expression through unique combinations of words in non-verbal children with autism. Ideally, once the system of Minspeak is mastered, productions of communication should take less time and effort across communication contexts.|$|E
