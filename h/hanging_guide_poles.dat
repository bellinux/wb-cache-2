5000|$|The rocket had a [...] "cylindro-conoidal" [...] warhead {{and were}} {{launched}} in pairs from half troughs on simple metal A-frames. The original rocket design had the <b>guide</b> <b>pole</b> side-mounted on the warhead, this was improved in 1815 with {{a base plate}} with a threaded hole. They could be fired up to two miles, the range being set by the degree of elevation of the launching frame, although at any range they were fairly inaccurate and had a tendency for premature explosion. They were as much a psychological weapon as a physical one, and they were rarely or never used except alongside other types of artillery. Congreve designed several different warhead sizes from 3 to 24 lb. The 24 lb type with a [...] <b>guide</b> <b>pole</b> was {{the most widely used}} variant. Different warheads were used, including explosive, shrapnel and incendiary. They were manufactured at a special facility near the Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills beside the River Lea in Essex.|$|R

40|$|Although 14 - 3 - 3 {{proteins}} {{participate in}} multiple biological processes, isoform-specific specialized functions, {{as well as}} functional redundancy are emerging with tissue and developmental stage-specificity. Accordingly, the two 14 - 3 - 3 e proteins in Drosophila exhibit functional specificity and redundancy. Homozygotes for loss of function alleles of D 14 - 3 - 3 e contain significantly fewer germ line cells (pole cells) in their gonads, a phenotype not shared by mutants in the other 14 - 3 - 3 gene leo. We show that although D 14 - 3 - 3 e is enriched within pole cells it is required in mesodermal somatic gonad precursor cells which <b>guide</b> <b>pole</b> cells in their migration through the mesoderm and coalesce with them to form the embryonic gonad. Loss of D 14 - 3 - 3 e results in defective pole cell migration, reduced pole cell number. We present evidence that D 14 - 3 - 3 e loss results in reduction or loss of the transcription factor Zfh- 1, {{one of the main}} regulatory molecules of the pole cell migration, from the somatic gonad precursor cells...|$|R

For crash tests a modified protection barrier SP- 04, composed of <b>guide</b> <b>poles,</b> type B, and bridge posts IPE 140, was chosen. The road barrier modification lies in using additional panels absorbing the impact energy. The protective panels, subjected to examina tion, consisted of a metal or a composite (laminate, glass-polyester) shield in which the foamed aluminium or polyurethane foam was a filling. The Suzuki Swift cars were prepared for the crash tests. Tests were carried out at the Au tomotive Industry Institute (PIMOT) in Warsaw, {{with the use of}} a test sample of the road barrier. For the safety sa ke the car's speed during the experimen tal examinations was limited to 50 km/h. Moreover, the vehicle hits perpe ndicularly in a properly modi fied road barrier's sector. During the test a reg istration of acceleration was carried out by the acceleration sensors placed in the car (among others in the centre of gravity and over the rear axle of a car).

50|$|The bow {{collector}} {{has fewer}} moving parts than the trolley pole, but is heavier and sometimes more complicated to construct. The construction of overhead wires for bow collectors is simpler than trolley pole wiring. As bow collectors {{do not have}} revolving mountings, the collector cannot jump off the wire or follow the wrong one at intersections, as trolley poles sometimes do. Thus overhead 'frogs' and <b>guides</b> for trolley <b>poles</b> are not necessary with bow collectors. Bow collectors are, however, much noisier than trolley poles.|$|R

In the early twentieth century, these ideas led Kristian Birkeland to build a terella, or laboratory device which simulates the Earth's magnetic field in a vacuum chamber, and which uses a cathode ray tube to simulate the energetic particles which compose the solar wind. A theory began to be formulated about the interaction between the Earth's magnetic field and the solar wind.|$|R

40|$|Abstract An {{absolute}} plate motion (APM) {{model is}} required to address {{issues such as the}} thermochemical evolution of Earth’s mantle. All APM models have to rely on indirect inferences, including those based on hot spots and seismic anisotropy, each with their own set of uncertainties. Here, we explore a seafloor spreading-aligned reference frame. We show that this reference frame fits azimuthal seismic anisotropy in the uppermost mantle very well. The corresponding Euler pole is close to those of hot spot reference frames, ridge motion minimizing models, and geodynamic estimates of net rotation and predicts clear trench motion patterns. We conclude that a net rotation <b>pole</b> <b>guided</b> by the spreading-aligned model (at 64 ∘E, 61 ∘S, with moderate rotation of ∼ 0. 2 … 0. 3 ∘/Myr) could indeed represent a standard, comprehensive reference frame for present-day plate motions with respect to the deep mantle. 1...|$|R
50|$|Starting {{the second}} half of his journey at Cape Horn, Palin views the end of the {{continent}} of South America. He travels through the southern islands of Chile to the town of Punta Arenas. He renews acquaintances with his <b>guide</b> from <b>Pole</b> to Pole and the statue of Ferdinand Magellan with the Indian whose toe he kissed to ensure a safe journey. Venturing through the islands, he views the Torres del Paine National Park and the grave of an English explorer who committed suicide in the area. At Chiloe Island, he chats with an American transplant who discusses the possible existence of witches on the island. Then he attends a local barbecue that included dancing and Palin attempting to play the horse's jawbone. North to Santiago, he observes a memorial to victims of the 1973 coup d'état. Driving through the Atacama Desert, Palin reaches the highest elevation of his life thus far. At the world's largest copper mine in Chuquicamata, Palin does the honours of counting down to the detonation of a mining blast. In the northern town of Arica, he catches a one-car train to La Paz in Bolivia. Things go smoothly until, as they are within striking distance of La Paz, the train has a freakish derailment. After several attempts to get the train back on line, they are successful and eventually reach the Bolivian capital in the black of night.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the propagation of electromagnetic waves through circular cylindrical waveguide having perfectly conducting walls. A finite difference approximation method is used to evaluate the propagation constant of the waves. The method is one of great generality. It may be used for any coaxial configuration of media inside the waveguide. In particular, the effects on propagating electromagnetic waves of a transversely magnetised ferrite tube adjacent to the waveguide wall are studied. Ferrite material is taken to have a permeability tensor of the form [image] when it is subjected to a static magnetic field along its third coordinate axis. The ferrite tube is subject to a static magnetic field formed by four magnetic poles at the corners of a square centred on the axis of the <b>guide,</b> like <b>poles</b> being at opposite corners. In the ferrite, this field leads to a permeability tensor which is dependent upon the angle in cylindrical polar coordinates when the z-axis is taken along the guide and Maxwell's equations reduce to two simultaneous second order partial differential equations with non-constant coefficients in the EZ and HZ components of the propagating electromagnetic wave. The finite difference approximation method reduces the problem to one of solving the condition for consistency {{of a large number of}} difference equations. Values of the propagation constant which satisfy this condition are found by a trial method which involves evaluating a determinant of very high order. This evaluation is carried out by computer and use is made of the banded nature of the determinant to prevent the amount of computer store required becoming prohibitive. The validity of the method is tested by applying it to several special cases with known results and its limitations and accuracy are discussed. A hypothesis is suggested to explain the numerical results...|$|R
40|$|A {{confirming}} {{check was}} performed to verify that the fuel assembly structural integrity is not impacted by the TPBARs. The structural adequacy of Westinghouse fuel assembly design is evaluated using NRC requirements for combined seismic and LOCA loads per Appendix A to the SRP 4. 2 and the approved methodology (Reference 1). The grid load results for the fuel assembly design in Watts Bar Unit 1 were reviewed. Based on the combined seismic and LOCA grid load there is a sufficient amount of grid load margin. The total weight for 24 TPBARs plus the holddown assembly is approximately 62 lbs, which is approximately 4 % {{of the weight of}} a typical fuel assembly. Because the TPBAR assembly is a hanging structure supported by the top nozzle adapter plate of the fuel assembly and the rodlets are <b>hanging</b> in the <b>guide</b> thimble tubes, the added weight can be considered {{to be a part of}} the fuel assembly nozzle support. The added TPBAR assembly weight, together with the rodlet stiffness, has an insignificant effect on the fuel assembly's dynamic characteristics. Therefore, the design basis analyses/evaluations performed for the fuel assembly structural integrity assessment for Watts Bar remain applicable. Furthermore, it is concluded that the LOCA and seismic combined loads will not be affected for Watts Bar Unit 1 containing TPBARs...|$|R
40|$|Protozoa and {{bacteria}} can easily cause disease in humans, specifically E. coli, Plasmodium falciparum, and Cryptosporidium parvum. These three pathogens {{are associated with}} large public health concerns that span the globe. The variety of locations in which these can be found is extremely high. Cryptosporidium spp. are extremely resilient when in oocyst form, P. falciparum is in the Anopheles spp. mosquito, while E. coli {{can be found on}} anything from food and water, to the skin and gut. The diverse range of locations these can be found in means that a portable sensor for their detection is necessary. In detecting Cryptosporidium, microscopy is the preferred method of identification currently. This requires a trained lab technician as well as calibrated and expensive optical equipment. Technician error can lead to false negative or positive diagnoses as well as sample destruction. A method to remove this technician interaction is thus necessary. This method must allow for objective results that are not open to interpretation. Particle immunoagglutination assays with Mie scatter allow for such an approach using inexpensive components. Particle immunoagglutination relies on the principles of antibody-antigen interaction and antibody conjugated latex particles. Using highly carboxylated latex particles, it is possible to attach IgG antibodies that are specific to a target antigen. Mie scatter is governed by particle size rather than wavelength as other forms of scatter. These two combined allow for an increase in light scatter based on particle size. This is correlated in a linear manner as long as the number of antibody-conjugated particles is higher than the number of antigens. Microfluidics is an ever growing field in the field of lab-on-a-chip that works very well with particle immunoagglutination. In this paper, a method to rapidly identify the presence of Cryptosporidium using microfluidics and particle immunoagglutination is discussed and analyzed. This method allows for a low detection limit of 1 - 10 oocysts/sample and an assay time of approximately 10 minutes. Results are displayed on a computer screen as the value of light scatter intensity and, when compared to a standard curve, is an objective way to identify the concentration and presence of oocysts in a diverse range of samples. These samples include PBS, pool water, and sump water. This system also works with P. falciparum, which causes malaria in rural and urban poor regions of the world. With the low income and remote nature of these locations, a portable microfluidic device is necessary. Smartphones allow for a portable microfluidic device that can detect P. falciparum antigens in 10 % whole blood. This system is capable of detecting as little as 1 pg/mL antigen. The microfluidic chip is inexpensive and disposable, allowing for a portable and inexpensive system. Using a single smartphone, a lab technique requiring a spectrometer, light source, and laptop can be made portable and less expensive, while maintaining sensitivity and specificity. In order to identify biological agents, there are commonly 3 methods for doing so: PCR, culturing, and ELISA. Culturing can take more than 24 hours, but results in a high signal to initial target ratio, while ELISA has poor sensitivity due to a 1 : 1 signal to target ratio, though is much quicker than culturing at usually 3 hours or less. PCR manages to solve both these problems by exponentially increasing the number of copies of target genetic material in a relatively short time frame of 1 - 3 hours. PCR relies on 4 basic components: target genetic material, primers to set a start and end location for duplication, polymerase to add base pairs to the strand beginning at the primers, and heat. PCR has worked very well during the past 31 years. It has worked so well that it is often the gold standard. However, there are flaws built into today's systems. These largely {{come in the form of}} inefficient heat transfer via conduction and large sample volumes due to unnecessary additions of nuclease free water (NFW). Both of these can be easily overcome by droplet PCR. Droplet PCR relies on small sample volumes of between 8 and 12 μL and convection in oil rather than conduction through plastic. In this study, it was found that droplet PCR could be performed on genomic E. coli DNA in as little as 15 minutes for 30 cycles. Sensitivity was also analyzed and found to be 2. 62 pg DNA/μL or about 5 x 10 ² cfu/sample. PCR has a theoretical lower limit of 1 copy of genetic material and this is only 2 orders of magnitude above that. The system was also tested for portability and resistance to shock and vibration. It was found that the surface heated, thermocouple guided system is more shock and vibration resistant than standard wire <b>guided,</b> <b>hanging</b> droplet PCR systems. It was also found that the use of coconut oil allows for the system to be transported without fear of the contents spilling out and contaminating other samples. This is because of coconut oil's high melting temperature...|$|R
