40|$|Learning by {{multimodal}} {{observation of}} vision and language offers a potentially powerful paradigm for robot learning. Recent experiments have shown that ‘mirror ’ neurons are activated when an action is being performed, perceived, or verbally referred to. Different input modalities are processed by distributed cortical neuron ensembles for leg, arm and head actions. In this overview paper we consider this evidence from mirror neurons by <b>integrating</b> <b>motor,</b> vision and language representations in a learning robot. © 2004 Elsevier B. V.

It focuses on the behavioural and kinematic effects of imagery following neurologic disorders. It explains how to select groups of patients that could benefit from a therapeutic approach using motor imagery and why motor imagery may be helpful during the different stages of the rehabilitation process. It details the process of <b>integrating</b> <b>motor</b> imagery into classical rehabilitation programmes, as well as data regarding the appropriate delivery and dosing of mental practice, in order to ascertain the efficiency of this technique during the rehabilitation process...|$|E
40|$|Children with autistic {{spectrum}} disorders {{have difficulties}} <b>integrating</b> <b>motor</b> and sensory experiences. It {{is important to}} address therapeutic interventions for these children. However, there are some limitations of the sensory integration therapy {{and the application of}} virtual reality for autistic children. SIT based on VR-TIS (VR-SIT) has three components: measurement of coordination ability, social skills training, sensory integration therapy. These components all originated from sensory integration therapy. A total of 12 autistic children and 20 healthy controls, all aged between five and six years, participated in this study. There are significant differences in autistic children and healthy controls for coordination ability measurement and social skill training. We found {{that it is possible to}} apply our system to the assessment of, and the therapy for, autistic children...|$|E

40|$|An ambitious goal in {{the area}} of physics-based {{computer}} animation is the creation of virtual actors that autonomously synthesize realistic human motions and possess a broad repertoire of lifelike motor skills. To this end, the control of dynamic, anthropomorphic figures subject to gravity and contact forces remains a difficult open problem. In this paper, we report on our ongoing development of a virtual stuntman, a dynamic graphical character that possesses a nontrivial repertoire of lifelike motor skills. The repertoire includes basic actions such as balance, protective stepping when balance is disturbed, protective arm reactions when falling, multiple ways of rising upright after a fall, and several more vigorously dynamic motor skills. Our virtual stuntman {{is the product of a}} recently proposed framework for <b>integrating</b> <b>motor</b> controllers, which includes among other ingredients an explicit model of pre-conditions; i. e., those regions of a dynamic figure's state space within which a given motor controller is applicable and expected to work properly...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} Clay, {{an evolutionary}} architecture for autonomous robots <b>integrating</b> <b>motor</b> schema-based control and reinforcement learning. Robots utilizing this system {{benefit from the}} real-time performance of motor schemas in continuous and dynamic environments while taking advantage of adaptive reinforcement learning. Clay coordinates assemblages (groups of motor schemas) using embedded reinforcement learning modules. The coordination modules activate specific assemblages based on the presently perceived situation. Learning occurs as the robot selects assemblages and samples a reinforcement signal over time. Clay was used by Georgia Tech in the configuration of a soccer team for the RoboCup- 97 simulator competition [Kitano et al., 1997]. A simple robot soccer strategy is used to to illustrate {{the utility of the}} system. Motor schemas are the reactive component of Arkin's Autonomous Robot Architecture (AuRA) [Arkin and Balch, 1997]. AuRA's design integrates deliberative planning at a top level with behavior-based motor control at the bottom. The lower levels, concerned with executing the reactive behaviors are incorporated in this research. Individual motor schemas, or primitive behaviors, express separate goals or constraints for a task. As an example, important schemas for a navigational task would include avoid obstacles and move to goal. Since schemas are independent, they can run concurrently, providing parallelism and speed. Sensor input is processed by perceptual schemas embedded in the motor behaviors. Perceptual processing is minimal and provides just the information pertinent to the motor schema. For instance, a find obstacles perceptual schema which provides a list of sensed obstacles is embedded in th...|$|E
40|$|The {{cerebellum}} {{has been}} considered only as a classical subcortical center for motor control. However, accumulating experimental and clinical evidences have revealed that the cerebellum also {{plays an important role}} in cognition, for instance, in learning and memory, as well as in emotional behavior and in nonsomatic activities, such as visceral and immunological responses. Although it is not yet clear through which pathways such cerebellar nonsomatic functions are mediated, the direct bidirectional connections between the cerebellum and the hypothalamus, a high autonomic center, have recently been demonstrated in a series of neuroanatomical investigations on a variety of mammals and indicated to be potential pathways underlying the cerebellar autonomic modulation. The direct hypothalamocerebellar projections originate from the widespread hypothalamic nuclei/areas and terminate in both the cerebellar cortex as multilayered fibers and the cerebellar nuclei. Immunohistochemistry studies have offered fairly convincing evidence that some of these projecting fibers are histaminergic. It has been suggested that through their excitatory effects on cerebellar cortical and nuclear cells mediated by metabotropic histamine H 2 and/or H 1 receptors, the hypothalamocerebellar histaminergic fibers participate in cerebellar modulation of somatic motor as well as non-motor responses. On the other hand, the direct cerebellohypothalamic projections arise from all cerebellar nuclei (fastigial, anterior and posterior interpositus, and dentate nuclei) and reach almost all hypothalamic nuclei/areas. Neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that these connections may be involved in feeding, cardiovascular, osmotic, respiratory, micturition, immune, emotion, and other nonsomatic regulation. These observations provide support for the hypothesis that the cerebellum is an essential modulator and coordinator for <b>integrating</b> <b>motor,</b> visceral and behavioral responses, and that such somatic-visceral integration through the cerebellar circuitry may be fulfilled by means of the cerebellar-hypothalamic circuits. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

It was first designed for the Honda Insight in 1999, which combined the electric motor with a smaller displacement VTEC engine and a lightweight aluminum body with improved aerodynamics.
