5|$|Life <b>for</b> <b>Sarah</b> {{during the}} reign of William and Mary was difficult. Although the new King and Queen had awarded Sarah’s husband the title Earl of Marlborough, Sarah and John enjoyed {{considerably}} less favour than they had {{during the reign}} of James II. The new Earl of Marlborough had supported the now exiled James; and by this time Sarah’s influence on Anne, and her cultivation of high members of the government to promote Anne’s interests, was widely known. Mary II responded to this by demanding that Anne dismiss Sarah. However, Anne refused. This created a rift between Mary and Anne that never healed.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Sarah-Jane and K9 {{returning}} to Doctor Who was {{an idea of}} Russell T Davies from pitching the show in 2003.

It was Davies' full intention <b>for</b> <b>Sarah</b> Jane to be used for this, and while Sladen originally declined a request, thinking her role would not be important, she changed her mind when she realised she would be {{the focal point of the}} adventure. After production of the episode was finished, Sladen was approached about a full spin-off series, The Sarah Jane Adventures, which was formally announced on 14 September 2006.|$|E

5|$|Davis fell in {{love with}} Sarah Knox Taylor, {{daughter}} of his commanding officer, future president Zachary Taylor. Both Sarah and Davis sought Taylor's permission to marry.

He consulted with his older brother Joseph, and they both began to question the value of an Army career. Davis hesitated to leave, but his desire <b>for</b> <b>Sarah</b> overcame this, and he resigned his commission in a letter dated April 20, 1835.
