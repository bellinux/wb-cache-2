40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of the catalytic core of murine terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) at 2. 35  Å resolution reveals a typical DNA polymerase β-like <b>fold</b> <b>locked</b> in a closed form. In addition, the structures of two different binary complexes, one with an oligonucleotide primer {{and the other with}} an incoming ddATP-Co 2 + complex, show that the substrates and the two divalent ions in the catalytic site are positioned in TdT {{in a manner similar to}} that described for the human DNA polymerase β ternary complex, suggesting a common two metal ions mechanism of nucleotidyl transfer in these two proteins. The inability of TdT to accommodate a template strand can be explained by steric hindrance at the catalytic site caused by a long lariat-like loop, which is absent in DNA polymerase β. However, displacement of this discriminating loop would be sufficient to unmask a number of evolutionarily conserved residues, which could then interact with a template DNA strand. The present structure can be used to model the recently discovered human polymerase µ, with which it shares 43 % sequence identity...|$|R

5000|$|Toggle {{mechanisms}} are four-bar linkages that are dimensioned {{so that they}} can <b>fold</b> and <b>lock.</b> The toggle positions are determined by the colinearity of two of the moving links. The linkage is dimensioned so that the linkage reaches a toggle position just before it folds. The high mechanical advantage allows the input crank to deform the linkage just enough to push it beyond the toggle position. This locks the input in place. Toggle {{mechanisms are}} used as clamps.|$|R
5000|$|In early 1978 {{preparations}} for the exchange of the F-4C for F-4Es were underway with the first two aircraft landing on 21 March. These aircraft were better equipped than the C models, with solid state radios and tactical navigation equipment, lead computing optical gunsight and ILS. Twelve aircraft arrived between April and July, and the last F-4Cs left on 14 June. On 1 August, one of the squadron's F-4Es was taking off for a training mission to practice interceptions for the William Tell interceptor weapons meet as the number two ship in a formation. After a very long takeoff roll followed by difficulty in controlling pitch, the crew found the plane's outer wing panels were in the folded position.

50|$|A switchblade (also {{known as}} an {{automatic}} knife, pushbutton knife, ejector knife, switch, Sprenger, Springer, flick knife, or flick blade) {{is a type of}} knife with a folding or sliding blade contained in the handle which is opened automatically by a spring when a button, lever, or switch on the handle or bolster is activated. Most switchblade designs incorporate a locking blade, in which the blade is locked against closure when the spring extends the blade to the fully opened position. The blade is unlocked by manually operating a mechanism that unlocks the blade and allows it to be <b>folded</b> and <b>locked</b> in the closed position.|$|R

5000|$|After July 1943, the appliqué armor bosses on {{the hull}} {{side of the}} M10A1 were deleted as the armor kits were never manufactured. This meant that some M36s had the {{redundant}} bosses, while others did not. The M36 initially retained the M10A1's [...] "stirrup" [...] gun rest on the rear hull; crews were unhappy {{about the lack of}} a proper travel lock for the 90 mm gun, and many improvised their own from travel locks taken from tanks. As the massive muzzle blast of the 90 mm gun obscured the crew's vision and reduced the rate of fire, a double-baffle muzzle brake was fitted to all vehicles after the first 600, beginning in early November 1944. A proper <b>folding</b> travel <b>lock</b> better-suited to the 90 mm gun was added to the rear hull at about this time. The gun itself was also modified with a better equilibrator and more powerful elevating mechanism.|$|R

50|$|It was a {{development}} of the Arisaka Type 38 Cavalry Rifle, the main difference being the bayonet is a needle type {{and it can be}} <b>folded</b> backwards and <b>locks</b> underneath the barrel. A hook was located directly below the front sight {{on the right side of}} the rifle, replicating the hooked quillon of the Type 30 bayonet for use in the bayonet fencing techniques taught to Japanese soldiers of the period. The Type 44 also included a compartment in the buttstock for which to store a unique two-piece cleaning rod. The cleaning rod storage compartment was accessed via an ingenious rotating door. It fired the 6.5×50mm Arisaka round, and capacity was an internal five-round box magazine, it was fed via five-round chargers.|$|R

As the rover was let down from the bay, most of the deployment was automatic. The rear wheels <b>folded</b> out and <b>locked</b> in place. When they touched the ground, the front of the rover could be unfolded, the wheels deployed, and the entire frame let down to the surface by pulleys.|$|R
50|$|The {{portable}} charcoal grill normally {{falls into}} either the brazier or kettle grill category. Some are rectangular in shape. A portable charcoal grill is usually quite compact and has features {{that make it}} easier to transport, making it a popular grill for tailgating. Often the legs <b>fold</b> up and <b>lock</b> into place so the grill will fit into a car trunk more easily. Most portable charcoal grills have venting, legs, and lids, though some models do not have lids (making them, technically, braziers.) There are also grills designed without venting to prevent ash fallout for use in locations which ash may damage ground surfaces. Some portable grills are designed to replicate the function of a larger more traditional grill/brazier and may include spit roasting as well as a hood and additional grill areas under the hood area.|$|R
5000|$|In Australia, the CB {{series was}} {{launched}} in December 1978.

The Deluxe model added cloth-inserted seats, push button radio, bumper rubber inserts, rubber body side protection mouldings, intermittent wipers, chrome wheel rings, map reading lights, and seat back map pockets. The Super Deluxe added halogen headlamps, window tint, FM radio, bumper overriders, and electronic safety check panel. For the facelift model from 1980 in Australia, the base [...] "Standard" [...] model was renamed [...] "Special", while the sedan and hardtop Super Deluxe trims each receiving unique (to trim level and body variant) wheel trims.

5000|$|The Telstar 28 has {{a number}} of {{distinguishing}} features, when comparing to the earlier versions as well as other foldable trimarans. Most notable is the folding mechanism for the amas. The amas fold in, by swiveling in and out alongside the main hull, reducing the beam from 18 ft to 8 ft 6 in, without extending the boat's overall length. The amas submerse approximately an additional four inches when retracted but retain their orientation to the main hull, so no additional surface is exposed to fouling if the amas were painted for the retracted waterline. This allows the boat to be berthed in a standard marina slip for extended period of time, eliminating one of the main problems facing trimaran owners. The <b>folding</b> mechanism is <b>locked</b> in the in or out position by a pair of line clutches in each cockpit locker, where one line controls the tension of the trampolines and the other actually locks the ama in position.|$|R
5000|$|Local or city {{ordinances}} {{are sometimes}} drafted to include specific classes of people {{not covered by}} the state criminal codes, such as individuals carrying <b>folding</b> knives with <b>locking</b> blades primarily for use as weapons. [...] For example, a San Antonio, Texas city ordinance makes it unlawful for anyone to knowingly carry within city limits [...] "on or about his person" [...] any folding knife with a blade less than 5.5 inches long with a lock mechanism that locks the blade upon opening. [...] This ordinance is designed to work in tandem with the Texas state statute making illegal the carrying of knives with blades longer than 5.5 inches. [...] The San Antonio ordinance allows police to charge persons carrying most types of lock blade knives without good cause with a criminal misdemeanor violation, allowing police to remove the knife from the possession of the offender, while providing exemptions from the ordinance designed to protect certain classes of people the city assumes to pose no threat to public order. [...] Occasionally, city and county ordinances conflict with state law. In one example, the city of Portland, Oregon initially passed a city ordinance banning all pocket knives, [...] until the measure was overturned by the Oregon Supreme Court as conflicting with state criminal statutes.|$|R
40|$|The Navachab Gold mine, an orogenic lode gold deposit, {{is located}} in the Karibib region of the Pan-African (ca. 550 - 500) Damara belt of central Namibia. Gold {{mineralisation}} is developed within the steeply NW dipping limb of the Karibib dome. Here, ore envelopes trend along three main orientations: a) trends shallowly towards the NE (the down plunge extent), b) trends sub-vertically in and along the down plunge extent and c) trends sub-horizontally across the down plunge extent. The down plunge extent represents the bulk of the gold mineralisation, hosting the only high grade ores mined at Navachab. As such, past work primarily focused on establishing the controls to the mineralisation observed here. The sub-vertical and sub–horizontal ore trends are seen as secondary, lower grade, being hosted in the footwall. By cutting pushbacks into the footwall, in an effort to regain access to high grade pit bottom, future gold production almost exclusively relies upon optimally mining these ores. This underlines the importance to investigate and outline the mineralising controls to the secondary ore trends. This study identified the following prevailing quartz vein sets developed within the footwall, set (1) dips shallowly towards the NE (conjugate vein set), (2) steeply towards the NW (bedding parallel veins) and (3) steeply towards the SE (S 2 foliation parallel). The NW and SE dipping sets contain high average gold grades, occurring at an infrequent vein density. The NE dipping veins, as a result of occurrence density alone, was highlighted as the dominant gold hosting set. Veining occurred during the late stages of the NW-SE directed, sub-horizontal shortening (D 2) event and is associated with top-to-the-NW thrusting and NW-verging folds. Re-Os molybdenite dating from auriferous quartz veins indicates mineralisation occurred at 525 - 520 Ma. As crustal shortening amplified the Karibib dome, flexural flow developed fractures along bedding planes, providing the control to bedding parallel veins (NW dipping). With continued crustal compression the dome later experienced <b>fold</b> <b>lock</b> up associated with reduced mean rock stress and sub-horizontal extension occurred along the steeply NW dipping limb. Horizontal extensional gashes sucked in fluids to form the shallowly NE dipping conjugate vein set. These features suggest the regional D 2 strain as the first-order control to quartz vein development, down plunge and within the footwall ores. To further define the secondary ores, lithological and structural controls were evaluated on a more detailed local scale. With equal amounts of biotite schist and calc-silicate host rock (bulk of the footwall lithology) material analysed, the biotite schist units were found to contain a larger volume amount of quartz veins. The mineralisation incurred is also developed at higher average gold grades compared to that of the calc-silicates, demonstrating biotite schist having the optimal rheology for quartz vein emplacement. Normal faulting and thrusting occurs widespread, at all scale levels, across the footwall. These were primarily observed along bedding foliations and secondly at higher angles cutting across foliation. The study did not constrain the extent of these, but can conclude faulting plays a very prominent role in re-distributing the secondary ores parallel to bedding along sub-vertical trend planes. Great care should be placed in properly modelling these with 3 D software such as Leapfrog. The Navachab gold mineralisation came about as a result of convergent and collisional tectonics activating metamorphic dehydration of the crustal metapelites. As these fluids ascended they absorbed gold from the crust, emplaced by either a magmatic or paleo-placer source. The gold enriched hydrothermal fluids amalgamated in large scale 1 ste order structures (shearing of the steep NW limb of the Karibib Dome, the Mon Repos Thrust Zone) that acted as primary active fluid path ways. In the case of Navachab the gold enriched fluid fluxed along these pathways while interacting with fluid sinks related to a physical throttle (brittle schist, folding, bedding parallel shears) and/or a chemical trap (marbles). By summarising and detailing the fluid sinks and active fluid pathways identified by this and previous works, it is strongly recommended that a mineral approach system be designed and implemented as targeting model to lead future exploration endeavours...|$|R
40|$|Systematic Monte Carlo {{simulations}} of simple lattice models {{show that the}} final stage of protein folding is an ordered process where native contacts get locked (i. e., the residues come into contact and remain in contact {{for the duration of the}} folding process) in a well-defined order. The detailed study of the folding dynamics of protein-like sequences designed as to exhibit different contact energy distributions, as well as different degrees of sequence optimization (i. e., participation of non-native interactions in the folding process), reveals significant differences in the corresponding locking scenarios—the collection of native contacts and their average locking times, which are largely ascribable to the dynamics of non-native contacts. Furthermore, strong evidence for a positive role played by non-native contacts at an early folding stage was also found. Interestingly, for topologically simple target structures, a positive interplay between native and non-native contacts is observed also toward the end of the folding process, suggesting that non-native contacts may indeed affect the overall folding process. For target models exhibiting clear two-state kinetics, the relation between the nucleation mechanism of <b>folding</b> and the <b>locking</b> scenario is investigated. Our results suggest that the stabilization of the folding transition state can be achieved through the establishment of a very small network of native contacts that are the first to <b>lock</b> during the <b>folding</b> process...|$|R

5000|$|The Sarpac was {{developed}} by the company Hotchkiss-Brandt, and it was primarily designed as an anti-tank weapon, but it is also useful against fortified positions constructed of concrete. The Sarpac comprises a launcher that can fire 68mm anti-tank, dual-purpose anti-armour/personnel or illuminating rocket projectiles. Sarpac {{is one of the few}} light antitank rocket launchers offered in the 1960s and 1970s that offered both a high penetration anti-tank round and a general purpose round, which has a smaller HEAT warhead than the anti-tank round, and in addition has two metal fragmentation collars located around the body of the warhead, and while its penetration is not effective against heavily armoured MBTs it does have sufficient penetration to be effective in the light anti-armour, anti-vehicle and anti-personnel and is considered superior for almost all combat firing missions other than antitank and concrete bunkers. And due to the size and weight of general purpose round there is almost double the effective range of the anti-tank round. [...] The launcher consists of two telescoping tube sections with the inner one extending forward, a trigger mechanism, a sighting unit, a folding shoulder support and a strap for carrying. The sighting mechanism while considered unusual is robust and has the shape of a parallelogram when in firing position. On the front of the sight there is both a ranging scale and a grid which enables the operator to fire at moving targets. The projectile is fin stabilized with eight forward <b>folding</b> fins which <b>lock</b> into position after leaving the tube. The rocket motor burns completely before leaving the tube, so as not to injure the gunner. The Sarpac launcher weighs approximately 1.9 kg empty and was originally meant to be disposable, however tests showed that the improved launcher introduced later could be reloaded for up to 20 firings. And although developed and manufactured in France, the Sarpac was never adopted by the French Army, however it has been exported to a number of countries. The unit cost of the projectile and launcher is reported to be extremely low.|$|R
