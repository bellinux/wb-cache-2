The MLI system consisted of two blankets, each blanket made up of alternate layers of double silk net (16 layers) and double aluminized Mylar radiation shields (15 layers) contained between two cover sheets of Dacron scrim reinforced Mylar. The insulation system was designed for and installed on a 87. 6 in diameter liquid hydrogen tank. Nominal layer density of the insulation blankets is 45 layers/in. The insulation system contained penetrations for structural support, plumbing, and electrical wiring that would be representative of a cryogenic spacecraft. The total steady state heat transfer rates into the test tank for shroud temperatures of 630, 530, 152 R were 164. 4, 95. 8, and 15. 9 BTU/hr respectively. The noninsulation heat leaks into the tank (12 fiberglass support struts, tank plumbing, and <b>instrumentation</b> <b>lines)</b> represent between 13 to 17 pct. of the total heat input.

The in situ measurement of the Optical Module time response yields a resolution better than 0. 5 ns. The performance of the acoustic positioning system, which enables the spatial reconstruction of the ANTARES detector with a precision of about 10 cm, is verified.

40|$|In {{the extreme}} {{environment}} of Antarctica at the South Pole, the IceCube experiment, the world's first kilometer-scale neutrino telescope, collects cosmic ray events. IceCube consists of over 5000 digital optical sensor modules (DOMs) deployed on 86 <b>instrumentation</b> <b>lines</b> each extending 2. 5 km {{deep in the}} antarctic ice. The array of optical modules monitors the Cherenkov light emitted by passing radiation, which, when digitized and timestamped to nanosecond precision, is used as input to sophisticated reconstruction algorithms that determine the direction, energy, and type of the incident cosmic ray event. In order to achieve this goal, the IceCube data acquisition system merges the digital data streams from each photodetector into a single time-ordered list which is presented to online triggers that determine, in realtime, {{whether or not a}} given pattern of hits is noise or signal. At the present time, the data provided to the triggers is limited by the performance of sorting and merging algorithms: the 500 Hz raw data rate from each sensor (2. 5 MHz array aggregate rate) is beyond the capability of the central sort and merge. The current solution adopted by the IceCube detector is to impose a hardware-based pretrigger coincidence on hits emanating from the DOMs which reduces the rate by a factor of 20. While this pretrigger coincidence has negligible impact on the detector sensitivity for the principal goal of high-energy neutrinos from galactic or extragalactic sources, other low-energy physics searches are affected. This presentation details work done to develop and implement a system, TESS, which is capable of merging the full raw data stream being produced by the IceCube DOMs. TESS is designed as a pipelined architecture with three major modules: server, selector and the client glued together by circular buffers. The three modules runs in only three threads and since the architecture is self synchronizing and uses no data copying maximum performance can be achieved for global sorting of payloads. The TESS sorting architecture was originally designed to provide a globally sorted data stream for triggers targeting low-energy events from annihilation of hypothesized dark-matter particles, however its utility is generalizable to any IceCube trigger which requires inspection of the full data stream. The IceCube online supernova detection system is a notable example. Moreover, the algorithm is generic to any system involving multiple, independently sorted data streams which must be merged into a single sorted data stream. © 1963 - 2012 IEEE.

The vacuum heads were not on at this time but the vacuum shell was on covering the piping penetrating into the inner vessel. Signal boxes with all feed through boards, the instrumentation box, and high voltage boxes were all installed with their pump outs capped. All 1 / 4 -inch <b>instrumentation</b> <b>lines</b> were terminated at their respective shutoff valves. All vacuum piping used for pumping down the inner vessel was isolated using o-ring sealed blind flanges. PV 215 A (VAT Series 12), the 4 -inch VRC gate valve isolating the cyropump, and the rupture disk {{had to be removed}} and replaced with blind flanges before pressurizing due to their pressure limitations. Stresses in plates used as blind flanges were checked using Code calcualtions. Before the CC test, vacuum style blanks and clamps were hydrostatically pressure tested to 150 % of the maximum test pressure, 60 psig. The Code inspector and Research Division Safety had all given their approval to the test pressure and procedure prior to filling the vessel with argon. The test was a major success. Based on the lack of any distinguishable pressure drop indicated on the pressure gages, the vessel appeared to be structurally sound throughout the duration of the test (approx. 3 hrs.). A major leak in the instrumentation tubing was discovered at half of the maximum test pressure and was quickly isolated by crimping and capping with a compression fitting. There were some slight deviations in the actual procedure used. The 44 psig relief valve located just outside the cleanroom had to be capped until the pressure in the vessel indicated 38 psi. This was to allow higher supply pressures and hence, higher flows through the pressurizing line. Also, in order to get pressure readings at the cryostat without exposing any personnel to the potentially dangerous stored energy near the maximum test pressure, a camera was installed {{at the top of the}} vessel to view the indicator mounted there. The monitor was viewed at the ante room adjacent to the cleanroom. The holding pressure of 32 psig (4 / 5 of the maximum test pressure) was only maintained for about 20 minutes instead of the half hour recommendation in the procedure. We felt that this was sufficient time to Snoop test and perform the pressure drop test.

After stripping the tritium from the water stream, the tritium will be further purified into a fully reusable form. The by-product streams, both liquid and gaseous, will be within applicable standards and can be released directly to the environment. The major components of the system consist of the following: an organic cleanup unit for the incoming waste stream, to be located inside a new glovebox in SW 149 B; catalytic exchange columns and electrolysis cells, and a hydrogen recombiner to be located inside new gloveboxes in T- 57; hydride storage beds and a cryogenic distillation unit to be located inside new gloveboxes in T- 16; control <b>instrumentation,</b> and tie-in <b>lines</b> to utilities as required. All major components of this system have been tested and successfully operated in a small pilot plant...|$|R
