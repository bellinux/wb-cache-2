5|$|Demolition {{began in}} August 1967. The {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Nordman Construction after an unsuccessful tender process. The company brought in the Magnus II, a <b>floating</b> <b>crane</b> with a lifting capacity of 400tons, which could remove {{all but two of}} the spans. These longer spans were pulled sideways off the piers, expecting that they would break into manageable pieces under their own weight. They proved stronger than this and remained intact, needing to be broken up in the river, with much sinking into the bed instead of being recovered.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{damage was}} found by the diver's {{preliminary}} examination of the ship, including tearing and inch-sized gaps in Astrids hull, as well as popped rivets and spread plates. The salvage company Blue Ocean, of Castletownbere, were appointed to recover the ship. The plans for the salvage operation consisted of removing around 3.5 tonnes of diesel fuel from the ship's fuel tanks, pumping {{water out of the}} ship and cutting away equipment including the rigging and masts, before a <b>floating</b> <b>crane</b> lifted the vessel from the rocks. The ship would then be taken to a nearby port to be handed over to the insurers. As of the end of July 2013 it was thought that the ship will never sail again, and that she would be written off as a total constructive loss. A month after sinking, Astrid was still under water.|$|E
5|$|Five sets of sluices and two weirs {{are used}} to control the canal's depth. The sluices, located at Mode Wheel Locks, Barton Locks, Irlam Locks, Latchford Locks and Weaver Sluices, are {{designed}} to allow water entering the canal to flow along its length in a controlled manner. Each consists {{of a set of}} mechanically driven vertical steel roller gates, supported by masonry piers. Originally, manually operated Stoney Sluices were used; these were replaced in the 1950s by electrically driven units, with automation technology introduced from the late 1980s. The sluices are protected against damage from drifting vessels by large concrete barriers. Stop logs can be inserted by roving cranes, installed upstream of each sluice; at Weaver Sluices, accessed by boat, this task is performed by a <b>floating</b> <b>crane.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>cranes</b> {{are used}} mainly in bridge {{building}} and port construction, {{but they are}} also used for occasional loading and unloading of especially heavy or awkward loads on and off ships. Some <b>floating</b> <b>cranes</b> are mounted on pontoons, others are specialized crane barges with a lifting capacity exceeding 10000 ST and have been used to transport entire bridge sections. <b>Floating</b> <b>cranes</b> have also been used to salvage sunken ships.|$|R

5|$|Development of Lae as a port, on {{the other}} hand, was envisaged from the start; but when the town was captured, the port was blocked by sunken barges and debris. The only {{discharge}} facilities were two rickety jetties unable to hold trucks. The first cargo was delivered by LST, and brought ashore over the beach by DUKWs, LCMs and lighters. Australian and American DUKWs were operated as a common pool. Initially, the US Navy would only allow the LSTs to arrive at night, {{and they had to}} shove off before daybreak. Only in November did it allow them to operate in daylight. Sunken Japanese barges were cleared away by a 150-ton <b>floating</b> <b>crane.</b> American engineers then installed a floating dock, which was towed to Lae in sections. It opened on 20 October, and a Type C1 ship, the Cape Kreig, discharged there that day. A new dock was completed on 23 November, although it was used to unload the Liberty ship Fremont Older on 15 November. A fuel jetty was built, along with a bulk petroleum storage facility, and the first tanker discharged there on 20 November. A 4-inch pipeline was run through to Nadzab.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of the fixed link became the biggest building project {{in the history of}} Denmark. In order to connect Halsskov on Zealand with Knudshoved on Funen, 18 kilometres to its west, a two-track railway and a four-lane motorway had to be built, via the small island of Sprogø {{in the middle of the}} Great Belt. The project comprised three different tasks: the East Bridge for road transport, the East Tunnel for rail transport and the West Bridge for road and rail transport combined. The construction work was carried out by Sundlink Contractors, a consortium of Skanska, Hochtief, Højgaard & Schultz (which built the West Bridge) and Monberg & Thorsen (which built the eight-kilometre section under the Great Belt). The work of lifting and placing the elements was carried out by Ballast Nedam using a <b>floating</b> <b>crane.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sydney {{paid off}} at Sydney on 8 May 1928 {{and arrived at}} Cockatoo Island in 1929, where she was broken up. The ship's {{foremast}} was retained, and in 1934, it was erected at Bradleys Head by the <b>floating</b> <b>crane</b> Titan. This initially served as {{a monument to the}} engagement against Emden, but was rededicated in 1964 as a monument for all Australian ships lost and all sailors killed in the line of duty. Part of the bow, including the stem head, jackstaff, and fairleads, was set into the seawall at Milsons Point, under the Sydney Harbour Bridge. One of the cruiser's derricks is on display in the Victory Memorial Gardens in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, and a compass stand is located at Port Macquarie, New South Wales. The main top-mast was erected at Environa, New South Wales, but rotted at the base and collapsed. It was later moved to Jervis Bay.|$|E
500|$|On 20 July 1870, Admiral Chichagov {{struck a}} {{sandbank}} near Koivisto at full speed. While not damaged in the incident, {{she was very}} firmly stuck and, {{an attempt by the}} armored frigate [...] pull her off failed two days later when the hawser snapped. The Russians started to off-load coal and equipment onto the low deck of the [...] in preparation for another attempt. While rigging another hawser aboard Strelets, it moved unexpectedly, badly injuring the ship's executive officer and a bosun, who later died of his injuries. The subsequent attempt by Sevastopol also failed, so several barges and a <b>floating</b> <b>crane</b> were summoned from Kronstadt the next day. As much weight as possible was transferred to the barges, including her forward guns, and she was successfully pulled free on 25 July. Admiral Chichagov was not damaged in the incident.|$|E

500|$|Cyclop {{remained}} out {{of service}} until 22 March 1869, when she was reactivated for service first as a guard ship in Kiel. She conducted a survey off Hörup Haff and Alsen for a shooting range for the old frigate , then assigned to the artillery school. In mid-June, Cyclop and two tugboats towed a [...] <b>floating</b> <b>crane</b> from the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin to the Königliche Werft in Kiel. She then {{took part in the}} annual fleet maneuvers in August and September, after which her crew was reduced in Kiel {{for the remainder of the}} year. In early 1870, Cyclop helped pull the armored frigate [...] free after she ran aground off the island of Langeland and towed her to Kiel for repairs. The damage proved to be too extensive for the Königliche Werft to complete, and so Friedrich Carl had to be towed to Britain; Cyclop escorted the ship through the Skagerrak.|$|E
500|$|Massachusetts, {{the third}} ship of the class, was laid down on 20 July 1939 at the Fore River Shipyard of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation in Quincy, Massachusetts. She was {{launched}} on 23 September 1941 and commissioned on 12 May 1942. After a shakedown cruise, the battleship departed Casco Bay, Maine on 24 October 1942 {{to support the}} Allied invasion of Africa, Operation Torch, as flagship of the Western Naval Task Force. Along with the heavy cruisers [...] and [...] and four destroyers, Massachusetts sailed to Casablanca {{on the evening of}} 7 November. The incomplete French battleship , missing one of her quadruple 380mm/45 caliber gun turrets, was in the harbor, having traveled there in 1940 to escape the German invasion of France. American planes were fired upon and two French submarines were spotted leaving the harbor; at 07:03 the coastal battery at El Hank opened fire on Massachusetts. It was mistakenly assumed that the gunfire had come from Jean Bart, so the order to neutralize the battleship was given. Massachusetts hit Jean Bart five times, and in the process disabled the one active main battery turret. Massachusetts also severely damaged the destroyer , which subsequently had to be beached. Four merchant ships and a <b>floating</b> <b>crane</b> were also destroyed.|$|E
500|$|On 22 February 1918, Rheinland and {{her sister}} [...] were tasked with a mission to Finland to support German army units to be {{deployed}} there. The ship arrived in the Åland Islands on 6 March, where her commander became the Senior Naval Commander, a position he held until 10 April. On 11 April, the ship departed the Ålands for Helsinki, {{with the intention of}} proceeding to Danzig to refuel. However, she encountered heavy fog while en route and ran aground on Lagskär Island at 07:30. Two men were killed in the incident and the ship was badly damaged. Three boiler rooms were flooded and the inner hull was pierced. Refloating efforts on 18–20 April proved unsuccessful. The crew was removed temporarily, to bring the pre-dreadnought [...] back into service. On 8 May, a <b>floating</b> <b>crane</b> was brought in from Danzig; the main guns, some of the turret armor, and the bow and citadel armor were all removed. The ship was lightened by —more than a third of her normal displacement—and with the aid of pontoons, eventually refloated by 9 July. The ship was towed to Mariehamn where some limited repairs were effected. On 24 July the ship departed for Kiel with the assistance of two tug boats; she arrived there three days later. It was determined that repair work was impractical and instead the ship was decommissioned on 4 October and placed into service as a barracks ship in Kiel.|$|E
