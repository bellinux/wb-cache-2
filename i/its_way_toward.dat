5|$|NY9L {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US9 and NY32 in downtown Glens Falls. It heads north, intersecting with local roads as it exits {{the city and}} enters the town of Queensbury. At the city line, maintenance of the route shifts {{from the city of}} Glens Falls to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Just north of the city limits, NY9L intersects NY254. The route continues northward through Queensbury, passing Floyd Bennett Memorial Airport and running parallel to the Washington County line on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> and eventually across the Blue Line into Adirondack Park. NY9L intersects NY149, an east–west arterial connecting Interstate87 (I-87) to Vermont, just north of the park limits.|$|E
5|$|Past Richburg, NY275 {{continues}} on a northeasterly track through the rural town of Wirt, {{running along the}} base of a narrow, largely undeveloped valley surrounding Little Genesee Creek as East Notch Road. The highway slowly increases in elevation for about , intersecting with the western terminus of CR8 (Inavale Road) and passing a handful of farms on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> East Notch, a gap between two large hills that serves as Little Genesee Creek's source. It eventually turns north to traverse the pass before winding its way down the opposite side. A short distance later, NY275 intersects with the northern terminus of CR8 as it curves to take a northwesterly track into the town of Friendship.|$|E

25|$|Although the United States of America was not allied to France, {{war broke}} out between America and Britain ostensibly over issues of trade embargoes and impressment of American sailors into the Royal Navy, {{both of which were}} {{directly}} or indirectly linked to the Napoleonic wars (the latter of which was not even brought up during the Treaty of Ghent). For {{the first two years of}} the war, a small number of British regular units formed the hard core around which the Canadian militia rallied. Multiple US invasions north of the border were repulsed; such an example can be seen at the Battle of Crysler's Farm in which battalions of 89th and 49th Regiments attacked and routed a significantly larger American force making <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> Montreal.|$|E
25|$|The {{route and}} the creek follow loosely {{parallel}} alignments {{to a point}} just outside the village limits of both New York Mills and the adjacent village of Yorkville, where NY5A connects to NY69 (Oriskany Boulevard) {{by way of a}} trumpet interchange. NY69 ends here while NY5A merges with the four-lane Oriskany Boulevard and heads east into Yorkville. Here, the route traverses several blocks of businesses and homes before crossing into the city of Utica. Within the city limits, NY5A closely parallels the CSX Transportation-owned Mohawk Subdivision as it heads along the northern fringe of the city. It continues to serve a mix of residential and commercial areas on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> downtown Utica, crossing the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad to reach an interchange with the NorthSouth Arterial (I-790, NY5, NY8, and NY12). NY5A becomes NY5S at the midpoint of the interchange.|$|E
25|$|Just {{east of the}} Stony Brook bridge, the Pine Meadow Trail {{begins on}} the {{southeast}} side of the highway. The road loosely parallels Stony Brook as it heads deeper into the park and serves the Reeves Meadow Visitor Center. The center is also a trailhead for the Reeves Brook Trail, with the Pine Meadow Trail passing the facility on its southeast side. Past the visitor center, the parallel alignments of Seven Lakes Drive and Johnsontown Road {{come to an end}} as the latter ends at a cul-de-sac adjacent to the former. The dead end serves as the trailhead for two hiking trails: the Blue Disc Trail, which starts just before the cul-de-sac; and the White Bar Trail, which begins at the cul-de-sac's northern end. Not far from this point, the Kakiat Trail crosses Seven Lakes Drive on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> Kakiat County Park.|$|E

25|$|I-490 {{continues}} {{to run in}} the former bed until exit21, where I-490 connects to NY590 and I-590 at an interchange known locally as the Can of Worms. At this point, the former Erie Canal route (now part of I-590) curves southward while I-490 continues eastward into the eastern suburbs of Rochester. Between exits21 and24, I-490 parallels the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision rail line, intersecting NY441, a four-lane divided highway in the process. South of exit25, I-490 traverses the southeastern suburbs of Rochester, passing close to East Rochester, Pittsford and Bushnell's Basin and closely paralleling NY96 on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> the Ontario County line. The freeway meets NY96 twice in Perinton and a third time in the Ontario County town of Victor, where I-490 passes along the western fringe of Eastview Mall. I-490 ends a short distance southeast of the third NY96 interchange at Thruway exit45.|$|E
25|$|MD 667 {{begins at}} the eastern Crisfield city limit. The road {{continues}} west as Chesapeake Avenue, which intersects Somerset Avenue on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> downtown Crisfield. MD 667 heads east as two-lane Old State Road. The highway curves north, then veers northeast parallel to MD 413 through the village of Hopewell. MD 667 veers north and intersects MD 413 (Crisfield Highway), where its name changes to Crisfield Marion Road. The highway leaves the suburban area surrounding Crisfield and enters a rural area as it continues northeast past St. Peter's Church Road, which leads toward St. Peter's Methodist Episcopal Church and Crisfield Municipal Airport. MD 667 curves east and intersects MD 413 again, then turns northeast and closely parallels the main highway to Marion Station. In {{the center of the}} village, the highway intersects Tulls Corner Road and its name changes to Hudson Corner Road.|$|E

500|$|Almost simultaneously, at 14:25 a Japanese scout {{aircraft}} {{from the}} cruiser [...] sighted the U.S. carriers. Although the aircraft was shot down, its report was transmitted in time, and Nagumo immediately ordered his strike force launched from Shōkaku and Zuikaku. The {{first wave of}} aircraft (27 Aichi D3A2 [...] "Val" [...] dive bombers and 15 Zeros) was off by 14:50 and on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> Enterprise and Saratoga. Coincidentally about this same time, two U.S. scout aircraft finally sighted the main Japanese force. However, due to communication problems, these sighting reports never reached Fletcher. Before leaving the area, the two U.S. scout aircraft attacked Shōkaku, causing negligible damage.|$|E
500|$|In {{the middle}} of March, once again at Fortress Monroe, the 29th {{witnessed}} {{the arrival of the}} Army of the Potomac, commanded by Major General George B. McClellan. [...] McClellan intended to use Fortress Monroe as his base of operations for an assault on the Confederate capital of Richmond. [...] The effort would be known as the Peninsular Campaign. [...] Over the course of March 1862, the men of the 29th watched as roughly 100,000 Union soldiers and 15,000 mules and horses debarked from Fortress Monroe. [...] The 29th was to remain at Fortress Monroe as the Army of the Potomac made <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> Richmond. [...] As the campaign became bogged down outside the Confederate capital, additional troops were called for and the 29th Massachusetts departed Hampton Roads on June 7, 1862.|$|E
500|$|MD194 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD26 (Liberty Road) in Ceresville. The roadway continues south as MD26, which crosses the Monocacy River on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> Frederick. [...] MD26 heads east from the intersection as a two-lane road toward Libertytown. MD194 heads north as Woodsboro Pike, which starts as a four-lane divided highway but reduces to two lanes as the highway {{passes through the}} suburban communities of Discovery and Spring Garden, where the state highway passes the historic Woodsboro and Frederick Turnpike Company Tollhouse. At Walkersville High School, the state highway enters the town of Walkersville and the highway's old alignment, Frederick Street, splits to the north. MD194 collects {{the other end of}} Frederick Street and passes between residential subdivisions before leaving the town at the highway's intersection with Devilbiss Bridge Road and Daysville Road. The former road heads west toward the historic Harris Farm; the latter highway leads to the 19th century Crum Road Bridge.|$|E

500|$|NY75 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY39 in Collins Center, a small hamlet {{in the town}} of Collins. It initially heads northeastward as the two-lane Sisson Highway, serving a handful of homes on the northern edge of the community prior to entering an open area dominated by farmland. About [...] from NY39, the road curves northward, taking on a due north alignment as it heads across the rolling terrain that comprises most of northern Collins. The highway serves just one community, the hamlet of Whites Corners, on its way into the adjacent town of North Collins. Here, development along NY75 remains limited at first, consisting {{of only a handful of}} isolated farms situated among fields or one of several forested areas. It quickly passes through Marshfield, located just past the town line, on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> Langford. A brief stretch of homes begins about [...] into the town as the route enters Langford, located [...] north of Collins Center.|$|E
2500|$|Flushing was {{the site}} of the first {{commercial}} tree nurseries in North America, the most prominent being the Prince, Bloodgood, and Parsons nurseries. Much of the northern section of Kissena Park, former site of the Parsons nursery, still contains a wide variety of exotic trees. The naming of streets intersecting Kissena Boulevard on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> Kissena Park celebrates this fact (Ash Avenue, Beech, Cherry ...Poplar, Quince, Rose). Flushing also supplied trees to the Greensward project, now known as Central Park in Manhattan.|$|E
2500|$|VT279 {{begins at}} the New YorkVermont state line, where the road {{continues}} west to NY7 in Hoosick, New York, as NY915G, a reference route signed as [...] "To VT279" [...] eastbound and [...] "To NY7" [...] westbound. As VT279, the highway heads northeast from the state line, passing through rural northwest Bennington as a three-lane road. It bypasses William H.

For a few miles the road was good, and they made rapid progress, but {{suddenly}} it became only a waste of sand, into which the horses sank fetlock deep at nearly every step. In addition to Tarzan, Abdul, the sheik, and his daughter were four of the wild plainsmen of the sheik's tribe who had accompanied him upon the trip to Sidi Aissa. Thus, seven guns strong, they entertained little fear of attack by day, and if all went well they should reach Bou Saada before nightfall.|$|R
