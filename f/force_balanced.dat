40|$|A shaking <b>force</b> <b>balanced</b> {{mechanism}} is a mechanism {{that does not}} exert dynamic re-action forces to its base and to its surrounding for any motion. For mobile mechanisms such as exoskeletons, humanoid robots, drones, and anthropomorphic hands force balance is an important property for, among others, their dynamic behavior, stability, safety, control, and low energy consumption. For the design of <b>force</b> <b>balanced</b> mechanisms with multiple closed loops {{it can be a}} significant challenge to obtain the balance conditions, especially when the mechanism consists of closed loops that depend on other closed loops. In this paper it is shown how with mass equivalent modeling the force balance conditions can be derived of a complex multi-degree-of-freedom parallel mechanism with multiple closed loops of which one or more depend on other closed loops. It is shown how such a mechanism can be divided in mass equivalent linkages such as mass equivalent dyads and mass equivalent triads for which each can be analyzed individually with principal vectors and linear momentum equations...|$|E

The shaking moment balancing is gained based on the angular momentum principle. This technique can be used for balancing of n-bar planar linkages which have a revolute input kinetic pair.

30|$|The {{strong motion}} seismographs in DMG and KKA Geo-SIG AC 23 have {{accelerometer}}s {{that are not}} the <b>force</b> <b>balanced</b> type. This accelerometer {{is based on a}} geophone mass-spring system (i.e., velocity transducer of the natural frequency 4.5 Â Hz) with electronic corrector that over-damps the geophone by applying a voltage with opposite polarity over the geophone and then the output response will be flat and proportional to the acceleration in the frequency range from 0.1 to 100 Â Hz, and an amplifier is applied to this voltage difference to regulate the gain (GeoSIG Ltd. 2015). Therefore, for these two accelerometric stations, an attention is required on S/N for very small amplitude signal at the low-frequency range. However, a quantitative discussion related to PKIN is possible within the target frequency range of this study, i.e., over 0.5 Â Hz and also the consideration is possible on the relation of DMG with KKA over 0.3 Â Hz as explained below.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program was}} initiated in the High Speed Water Tunnel to measure force coefficients for hydrofoils under cavitating conditions. This program necessitated either a new <b>force</b> <b>balance</b> or a major {{modification of the}} existing one. Various balance configurations and pressure seal designs which were considered are described. A balance modification design was selected which consists of an appendage bolted between the existing balance and the water tunnel working section. This appendage alters the basic geometry of the <b>force</b> <b>balance</b> so that the model is now mounted on a parallelogram linkage instead of on a simple pivoted lever. The addition of the parallelogram force table suspension to the old balance renders the modified balance unresponsive to moments which in the old <b>balance,</b> interacted with <b>forces</b> and resulted in errors in the force readings. This modification which is described in detail was accomplished and resulted in a successful <b>force</b> <b>balance</b> capable of accurate measurement of forces on cavitating and noncavitating hydrofoils; and, in fact, {{it is expected to}} replace the old <b>force</b> <b>balance</b> for all <b>force</b> measurement work in the High Speed Water Tunnel.

40|$|AbstractâUsing a <b>force</b> <b>balanced</b> translational-radial dynamics, phase {{space of}} the moving single bubble {{sonoluminescence}} (m-SBSL) in 85 % wt sulfuric acid has been numerically calculated. This phase space is {{compared with that of}} single bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL) in pure water which has been calculated by using the mere radial dynamics. It is shown that in 85 % wt sulfuric acid, in a general agreement with experiment, the bubbleâs positional instability threshold lays under the shape instability threshold. At the onset of spatial instability of moving sonoluminescing (SL) bubble in 85 % wt sulfuric acid, temporal effects of the hydrodynamic force on the bubble translational-radial dynamics have been investigated. The appearance of non-zero history force on the moving SL bubble is because of proper condition which was produced by high viscosity of acid. Around the moving bubble collapse due to the rapid contraction of the bubble wall, the inertial based added mass force overcomes the viscous based history force and induces acceleration on the bubble translational motion...|$|E

The FPG 8601 measurement range spans {{the gap between the}} traditional measurement regimes of âpressure â and âvacuumâ, a range where other primary pressure standards either do not exist or do not have uncertainties sufficient to support the FPG 8601 traceability.

40|$|Vibration {{in moving}} {{mechanisms}} and manipulators {{is almost always}} present due to manufacturing tolerances, as-sembly errors and non-uniform density of materials. Small errors in parameters such as mass and length {{may result in a}} non-balanced mechanism producing shaking forces. Normally a mechanism would be balanced using a trial and error method, which repeats the use of trial weights and measurements until the mechanism is balanced, however this method is time consuming and therefore costly. This report presents a method that detects, locates and quantifies the error(s) in a <b>force</b> <b>balanced</b> mechanism, after just one test run. An adjustable 1 -DoF rotating mechanism is developed and a sensitivity analysis is performed to obtain the shaking force response of each parameter error. Comparing the shaking force response with the theoretical values shows the effectiveness of the adjustable 1 -DoF rotating mechanism. Then the inversed relations of these shaking force responses are plotted in a design chart which can trace back the parameters that need adjusting. The method demonstrates that a 1 -DoF mechanism can be balanced after just one test run. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractâLeveraging {{techniques}} {{pioneered by}} the SLAM com-munity, {{we present a}} new filtering approach called simultaneous compliance and registration estimation or CARE. CARE is like SLAM in that it simultaneously determines the pose of a surgical robot while creating a map, but in this case, the map is a compliance map associated with a preoperative model of an organ {{as opposed to just}} positional information like landmark locations. The problem assumes that the robot is forcefully contacting and deforming the environment. This palpation has a dual purpose: 1) it provides the necessary geometric information to align or register the robot to a priori models, and 2) with palpation at varying forces, the stiffness/compliance of the environment can be computed. By allowing the robot to palpate its environment with varying forces, we create a <b>force</b> <b>balanced</b> spring model within a Kalman filter framework to estimate both tissue and robot posi-tion. The probabilistic framework allows for information fusion and computational efficiency. The algorithm is experimentally evaluated using a continuum robot interacting with two bench-top flexible structures. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{synthesis}} of {{the motion of the}} center of mass (CoM) of linkages as being a stationary or invariant point at one of its links. This is of importance for the design of inherently shaking <b>force</b> <b>balanced</b> mechanisms, static balancing, and other branches of mechanical synthesis. For this purpose Fischer's mechanism is investigated as being a composition of pantographs. It can be shown that linkages that are composed of pantographs and of which all links have an arbitrary CoM can be inherently balanced for which Fischer's method is a useful tool. To calculate the principal dimensions for which linkages have their CoM at an invariant link point, an approach based on linear momentum is proposed. With this approach it is possible to investigate each degree-of-freedom individually. Equivalent Linear Momentum Systems are proposed to facilitate the calculations in order to use different convenient reference frames. The method is applied to planar linkages with revolute joints, however it also applies to linkages with other types of joints. As a practical example a shaking force and shaking moment balanced 2 -DoF grasper mechanism is derived. [...] -...|$|E
