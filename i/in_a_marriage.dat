5|$|Although Michael VIII Palaiologos engaged him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>marriage</b> {{alliance}} and awarded {{him with the}} high title of sebastokratōr, John remained the foremost of Palaiologos' Greek opponents throughout the latter's reign. A staunch opponent of the Union of the Churches promoted by Palaiologos for political reasons, he provided refuge to several political opponents of the emperor, and even convoked synods that anathematized Palaiologos and the supporters of the Union. He resisted several attempts by Byzantine armies to conquer Thessaly, and allied himself with Palaiologos' Latin enemies, including the Duchy of Athens and Charles of Anjou. He died in 1289, leaving the rule of Thessaly to his sons, Constantine and Theodore.|$|E
5|$|The two brothers' good {{relationship}} deteriorated after King Andrew had the child Solomon crowned king in 1057 or 1058. The coronation was {{the consequence of}} the peace negotiations with the Holy Roman Empire, because the Germans did not acquiesce <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>marriage</b> between Solomon and Judiththe sister of the young German monarch, Henry IVuntil Solomon's right to succeed his father was declared and publicly confirmed. Thereafter Andrew was determined to secure the throne for his son. He invited Béla to his manor in Tiszavárkony, where the King offered his brother a seemingly free choice between a crown and a sword (which were the symbols of the royal and ducal power, respectively). However, he had ordered that Béla be murdered if he chose the crown. Having been informed of his brother's secret plan {{by one of his}} own partisans in the royal court, Béla opted for the sword, but he departed for Poland after the meeting.|$|E
25|$|Some scholars, {{such as the}} {{historian}} Jan Drijvers, assert that Constantius and Helena were joined <b>in</b> <b>a</b> common-law <b>marriage,</b> <b>a</b> cohabitation recognized <b>in</b> fact but not in law. Others, like Timothy Barnes, assert that Constantius and Helena were joined <b>in</b> <b>an</b> official <b>marriage,</b> {{on the grounds that}} the sources claiming <b>an</b> official <b>marriage</b> are more reliable.|$|R

30|$|The intuition {{underlying}} Lemma  1 is straightforward. A man who marries polygynously provides less marital interaction {{to each of}} {{his wives}} compared to <b>a</b> man <b>in</b> <b>a</b> monogamous <b>marriage.</b> Hence, the man <b>in</b> <b>a</b> polygynous <b>marriage</b> has to compensate for each of his wives’ forgone utility that results from sharing him with co-wives. There are two ways he can do this. He could offer a higher income transfer to his wife or a higher amount of bequest to her son than she would receive <b>in</b> <b>a</b> monogamous <b>marriage.</b> The difference {{can be interpreted as}} the cost of polygynous mating for men.|$|R

25|$|At Chiang Mai, King Kue Na was interested.

While the peace with Mohnyin did not last—Ava and Mohnyin were to fight another war just three years later—the marriage between Swe and Mi-Nauk lasted. The couple had four children at Pyinzi: Minye Kyawswa, Saw Pyei Chantha, Thihathu and Minye Kyawhtin.|$|E

25|$|Genealogies and archaeological {{evidence}} {{suggest that the}} Gowa dynasty was founded around 1300 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>marriage</b> between a local woman and a chieftain of the Bajau, a nomadic maritime people. The establishment of Gowa {{was part of a}} radical restructuring of South Sulawesi society by which wet rice cultivation intensified rapidly. Likewise, early Gowa was a largely agrarian polity with no direct access to the coastline. Talloq was founded two centuries later when a Gowa prince fled to the coast after his defeat in a succession dispute. The coastal location of the new polity allowed it to exploit maritime trade to a greater degree than Gowa.|$|E
25|$|Marie de' Medici {{became the}} second wife to King Henry IV of France <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>marriage</b> by proxy on 5 October 1600 {{by the power}} {{invested}} in her uncle, Grand Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany. When Henry was assassinated in 1610, Louis XIII, his son and successor to the throne, was only eight years old. Louis' mother, Marie, acted as his regent as commanded by the Frankish Salic law {{in case of an}} infant ruler. However, even after Louis came of age at thirteen in 1614, the queen continued ruling in his stead. In 1617, Louis XIII finally decided to take governing matters in his own hands at the age of fifteen and the queen was exiled to Blois.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, it is {{possible}} that individuals in a de facto relationship can be treated substantively different to a person <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>marriage.</b> In the event of an unexpected end to a de facto relationship (such as death of a partner), the surviving partner must often prove the existence of a relationship in order to be registered as the next of kin on a death certificate and receive government bereavement payments and access to a partner's superannuation. These requirements vary on a state by state basis. Given that same-sex couples do not have the option to marry, as heterosexual couples do, these discrepancies can have a particularly discriminatory impact on same-sex couples. The rights of a de facto partner may be poorly understood by government departments, resulting in occasions where said couples have not had their rights upheld.|$|E

25|$|Despite his {{dependence}} on Syriam's revenues, Minye Thihathu did nothing when other rulers {{tried to take}} over the port. In 1601, the Syriam garrison repulsed two separate attacks by Yan Naing, the lord of Prome, and Binnya Law, a Mon lord. Later in the year, the garrison came under siege by Binnya Dala, the Siamese appointed viceroy of Martaban, for seven months until May 1602. Binnya Dala then made peace with De Brito <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>marriage</b> of alliance between his daughter and De Brito's son Simon. All the while, Minye Thihathu kept a series of garrisons near Syriam and Martaban to prevent the warfare from spilling over but nothing else. By then, even the authority of the Arakanese king over the Portuguese led garrison was nominal. De Brito had been in contact with Aires de Saldanha, Viceroy of Goa, to make Syriam a Portuguese colony.|$|E
25|$|In marriage, {{there are}} three types of assets: those of the husband, those of the wife, and the common assets that pertain to both. Land and houses <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>marriage</b> {{continue}} to be the property of the person who brought them to the marriage, but in order to sell them, both the husband and wife must sign. In the case of divorce, both the man and woman are entitled to ownership of the marital home. In the case of the death of a spouse, the surviving spouse, regardless of gender, has equal inheritance rights to the marital home. If there is no will when the husband dies, the wife is given an equal category as the children for inheritance. Before marriage, a couple can sign a legal document separating all assets so that the woman and man each administer her or his own; in this case, the husband cannot control his wife's assets.|$|E
25|$|Brandt was in Germany from September to December 1936, {{disguised}} as a Norwegian student named Gunnar Gaasland. The real Gunnar Gaasland was married to Gertrud Meyer from Lübeck <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>marriage</b> of convenience {{to protect her from}} deportation. Meyer had joined Brandt in Norway in July 1933. In 1937, during the Civil War, Brandt worked in Spain as a journalist. In 1938, the German government revoked his citizenship, so he applied for Norwegian citizenship. In 1940, he was arrested in Norway by occupying German forces, but was not identified as he wore a Norwegian uniform. On his release, he escaped to neutral Sweden. In August 1940, he became a Norwegian citizen, receiving his passport from the Norwegian legation in Stockholm, where he lived {{until the end of the}} war. Willy Brandt lectured in Sweden on 1 December 1940 at Bommersvik College about problems experienced by the social democrats in Nazi Germany and the occupied countries at the start of the Second World War. In exile in Norway and Sweden Brandt learned Norwegian and Swedish. Brandt spoke Norwegian fluently, and retained a close relationship with Norway.|$|E
