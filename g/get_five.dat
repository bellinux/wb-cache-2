Nevertheless, Morkel was picked for the Africa squad to play Asia in the 2005 Afro-Asia Cup, but withdrew due to injury. He appeared however for Africa the following series, in 2007, and made history in the second game when he opened the bowling with his brother Morné, the first time two brothers have done so in ODI cricket.|$|E
25|$|Fernandez started wrestling in 1981, mainly {{performing}} in the Florida and Texas territories, as ”Hercules” Hernandez. In 1982, {{he joined the}} NWA Central States territory (which ran out of Kansas City and promoted shows in Kansas, Missouri, and Iowa). While in Central States, Hercules teamed up with Dewey Robertson, and the two won the Central States tag team championship on two occasions; they beat Mike George and Mark Romero both times. He also held the Central States Television title for a little over six months, winning it from, and losing it back to, his main rival, Romero. His two other notable feuds in the Central States territory were with Manny Fernandez and Harley Race. His feud with Race garnered Hernandez significant attention in the national wrestling scene, due to Race's stature as a former NWA World Champion. This feud began because Race had an issue with Oliver Humperdink’s House of Humperdink stable, which Hernandez had {{become a part of}} soon after joining the promotion. One match between the two had the stipulation that if Race won, he would <b>get</b> <b>five</b> minutes inside a steel cage with Humperdink. Hercules was caught using brass knuckles and disqualified, which meant that the cage match was on. When the match was about to start, Hernandez ran to ringside, knocked Race out and threw him into the ring with Humperdink. In the end, Race recovered and delivered a piledriver to Humperdink onto a steel chair injuring (kayfabe) Humperdink and causing him to leave the territory. After losing his manager, Hernandez did not stay in the Central States territory for long but instead signed up with Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP).|$|E

500|$|Jason and SOPHIA have {{separate}} power meters, and they decrease whenever they sustain damage by an enemy {{or any other}} hazardous object or whenever Jason falls from a high place. Players can replenish these power meters by collecting power capsules that appear throughout the game. [...] Also, the player can replenish Jason's health to full at any time by re-entering SOPHIA. The player loses a life if either power meter runs out, and the game ends when all lives are lost. Players <b>get</b> <b>five</b> continues {{that allow them to}} restart the game at the same level in which they have lost all their lives.

The game ends when players lose all their lives, but they can continue and resume play at the beginning of the Act in which they have lost all their lives.

[...] However, new or inexperienced players should buy it. Fleming added that it was odd that the PSP games were included as downloads, {{and would like to}} have seen content migrate over to the PlayStation Vita. Jeffrey L. Wilson of PC Magazine gave the collection a 4 out of 5 and called it [...] "an excellent purchase for anyone looking for cinematic, blood-drenched action–especially newcomers who <b>get</b> <b>five</b> titles for the price of one", but added that long time fans may not find much value in the collection.|$|E

500|$|Following the 1899 season, the Senators {{franchise}} ceased operations, {{which resulted}} in Padden's sale, along with O'Brien, to the Detroit Tigers of the American League, which was a minor league at the time. [...] However, before the [...] season began, he joined the Chicago White Sox, also a minor league team, as their player-manager instead. On May 16, {{he was involved in}} a physical altercation with Ducky Holmes and another Detroit player. While playing a doubleheader on September16, against Connie Mack and his Milwaukee team, Padden suggested to Mack that the second game be shortened to five innings {{due to the fact that}} the first game lasted just over three hours, and they might not finish the second game before darkness. [...] Mack, who estimated that he could <b>get</b> <b>five</b> more good innings from his game one starting pitcher, Rube Waddell, quickly agreed. [...] Padden's suggestion backfired, and turned into a successful strategy for Mack, whose team, with Waddell pitching, won the game. Despite that incident, Padden and his leadership skills led the White Sox to the American League championship that season.|$|E
500|$|For one of {{his side}} projects, Chris Thile {{knew he wanted to}} form a string quintet {{composed}} of mandolin, violin, banjo, guitar, and bass with childhood friend and fiddler Gabe Witcher, but didn’t know which direction he wanted to take the band. At the Telluride Bluegrass Festival in Telluride, Colorado, Thile met banjoist Noam Pikelny and later commented that “every note he played was something I wish I’d played”. It was then that Thile realized that he wanted to “put [...] stamp on the traditional bluegrass ensemble”. Thile wanted to <b>get</b> <b>five</b> musicians together for a Nashville jam session in 2005, after he found talented bluegrass musicians that could fill the positions. The bassist Thile was searching for, Greg Garrison, was recommended to Thile by Pikelny, who had performed alongside Garrison in the Cajun jam band Leftover Salmon. The guitar position was filled by Chris Eldridge, from the bluegrass band the Infamous Stringdusters. The five musicians met up in Nashville one day in 2005 and decided that they needed to “do something musical together”. A few nights later, the group met again “just to drop a ton of money, drink too much wine, eat steaks, and commiserate about our failed relationships”. That night, they came to an agreement and formed a bluegrass band.|$|E
