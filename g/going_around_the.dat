Now, at last, I {{can tell you that}} we are going on the voyage which all submariners have dreamed of ever since they possessed the means of doing so. We have the ship and we have the crew. We’re <b>going</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world, nonstop. And we’re going to do it entirely submerged.|$|E

The highway returns to a more due-east orientation as it passes north of the village, then gradually curves to the northeast again as it passes through a heavily farmed area.|$|E

25|$|The Silesian tram {{network in}} Poland has two tram roundabouts. In the city centre of Katowice, the tram line {{passes through the}} middle of the Ziętka Roundabout in a north-south alignment, with a tram stop {{in the middle of the}} circle. In Będzin, unusually, the tram {{junction}} itself forms a circular roundabout, with trams <b>going</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> circle; there are tram stops immediately outside the roundabout on each branch.|$|E

The wearer can still be heard, but it renders their speech completely unintelligible, distorts their facial features, and causes drooling if the wearer attempts to talk.|$|E
25|$|In December 2009 the Circle {{line was}} {{extended}} to include the Hammersmith & City route from Edgware Road to Hammersmith. Rather than continuously running around the circle, trains now travel from Hammersmith to Edgware Road, generally <b>going</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> circle once before terminating at Edgware Road, and returning via the same route; occasionally, trains may also continue clockwise through Edgware Road to additional stations. The change was made to improve reliability and increase the service frequency on the Hammersmith branch.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the experiment, the most {{prevalent}} model for describing the atom was the Bohr model, which described electrons as <b>going</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> positively charged nucleus only in certain discrete atomic orbitals or energy levels. Since the electron was quantized to be only in certain positions in space, the separation into distinct orbits was referred to as space quantization. The Stern–Gerlach experiment was meant to test the Bohr–Sommerfeld hypothesis that the direction of the angular momentum of a silver atom is quantized.|$|E
25|$|The Siwanoy Trail {{consists}} of a trail system that originates in the Central Woodlands section of the park. Originating at City Island Road, it bears to the northeast before splitting into two spurs, one going east to the Rodman's Neck meadow and the other going north around Bartow Circle. At the circle's eastern side, the trail splits again. One spur goes northeast in a self-closing loop to the Bartow-Pell Mansion, and the other goes northwest to connect to Split Rock Trail before <b>going</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Hutchinson River Parkway's interchange with Orchard Beach Road.|$|E
25|$|In an automobile, Shaft A is {{connected}} to the engine (through the transmission), and Shafts B and C are connected to two road wheels, one {{on each side of the}} vehicle. When the vehicle turns, the wheel <b>going</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> outside of the turning curve has to roll further and rotate faster than the wheel on the inside. The differential permits this to happen while both wheels are being driven by the engine. If the sum of the speeds of the wheels is constant, the speed of the engine does not change.|$|E

25|$|A {{skipping}} rope (British English) or jump rope (American English) {{is a tool}} used in the sport of jump rope where one or more participants jump over a rope swung so that it passes under their feet and over their heads. There are multiple subsets of jump rope including: single freestyle, single speed, pairs, three person speed (double dutch), and three person freestyle (double dutch freestyle). The events are often separated by gender and age. There are hundreds of competitive teams all around the world. There are a few major organisations that support jump rope as a sport as seen below, schools rarely have jump rope teams, and states do not sanction official events for high school or elementary school. In freestyle events, jumpers {{use a variety of}} basic and advanced techniques in a routine of one minute, which is judged by a head judge, content judges, and performance judges. In speed events, a jumper alternates their feet with the rope <b>going</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> jumper every time one of their feet hit the ground for 30 seconds, one minute, or three minutes. The jumper is judged on the number of times the right foot touches the ground in those times.|$|E
25|$|Massa at {{this point}} was twelve seconds in arrears and Hamilton was granted {{permission}} by Bonnington to attack earlier than planned. Rosberg's front brake temperatures went beyond their optimum operating window and {{in his attempt to}} conserve his rear tyre life by moving his brake bias towards the front of his car, he compromised his brakes as a result. Hamilton used DRS and as Rosberg applied his brakes, he drove straight into the Rettifilo chicane's run-off area, slalomed his way through the obstacles, enabling Hamilton to gain the lead. Alonso's energy recovery system failed which triggered a complete electrical shutdown half a minute later and pulled {{over to the side of}} the track, and into Rettifilo's run-off area to retire for the first time in the season. Button feigned an overtaking attempt at Pérez driving into the Rettifilo chicane but was unable to get ahead and both drivers narrowly avoided contact. Bottas made an passing attempt on Magnussen entering the same turn but Magnussen drove defensively, forcing Bottas to cut the chicane on lap 32. On the 33rd lap, Ricciardo overtook Räikkönen for ninth by <b>going</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> inside of the latter entering the Rettifilo chicane and braked later than he did.|$|E
25|$|Fassler {{extended}} his lead to 1.5 seconds over Jarvis while both Toyota cars were lapping one second {{slower than the}} leader's place, and the No. 4 ByKolles car moved in front of Rebellion Racing's No. 13 vehicle. Bernard lost control of his car while lapping one of the Ford GT entrants, allowing Jarvis to close up to the Porsche driver. Bernard attempted to pass Fässler around the outside at turn one for first position but the latter defended his line and narrowly avoided going wide off the track. It allowed Jarvis and Jani to again close the gap {{and made it a}} four-car battle for first place while lapping slower traffic. Bruni battled Mücke for third in LMGTE Pro and had Harry Tincknell in the second Ford close behind him. Bernard caught Fässler, who was held up by one of the Aston Martin cars in the final turn, and temporarily claimed the lead in the first corner before running wide. Bernhard avoided hitting the KCMG car, allowing the No. 7 Audi to retake the position at the turn's exit. Jani attempted to move in front by <b>going</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> inside of Jarvis, but after driving back onto the racing line heading into the first turn, he locked his tyres. This caused Jani to drive straight, and Mücke's front-end made contact with the Porsche's left-rear corner, causing Jani to spin off into the run-off area.|$|E

[...] "The way we behave, to treat one another the way we're treating one another, to maintain this level of intolerance and discriminatory prejudice... hateful behavior towards other human beings who are different than you are," [...] Madonna concluded.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{breakout}} of World War II in Europe in 1939, missionary {{efforts in}} Tonga continued. At the time, mission president Dunn encouraged {{the people to}} maintain gardens and extra food supplies. Within a year of the war starting, LDS Church president Heber J. Grant sent a telegram to Dunn directing that all foreign missionaries return to the United States. Dunn arranged for those missionaries to go to Hawaii. In an effort {{to explain why the}} missionaries needed to return to America, Dunn stated that Grant was [...] "inspired to call them back". However, this explanation did not quell the rumors of the church being discontinued that were <b>going</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> islands. By 1942, missionaries returned to Tonga. Dunn ensured there were at least 15 missionaries in the mission field from 1942 to 1945.|$|E
