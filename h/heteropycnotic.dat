40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of cytological observations on microsporogenesis in the self-sterile species Coffea canephora. It was found difficult to study chromosome structure in the first stages of meiosis because the chromosomes do not stain well with aceto carmine and could be seen only as long faintly threads with some <b>heteropycnotic</b> regions. In many observations of the pachytene stage it was possible to observe and study a chromosome attached to the nucleolus. This chromosome characteristically had a visible centromere which divided it into two arms of different sizes. The short arm was attached to the nucleolus and had several <b>heteropycnotic</b> regions. In the long arm the <b>heteropycnotic</b> regions were observed to be close to the centromere; the distal portion of this arm was only faintly stained. Other chromosomes in the pachytene stage were found to have a conspicuous centromere located between two highly <b>heteropycnotic</b> regions. The <b>heteropycnotic</b> regions in some chromosomes were located near the centromere while in others they were observed to be scattered throughout the chromosome. In diakinesis the chiasmata were counted and there were found seven chromosomes with one chiasma, three chromosomes with two chiasmata and one chromosome with three chiasmata. The average number of chiasmata per cell was 15. 88. In metaphase the average number of chiasmata per cell was found to be 14. 57, which is less than the average per cell in diakinesis. Anaphase I appeared normal as did all subsequent phases of meiosis, that resulted finally in the development of four microspores with eleven chromosomes each. Very few pollen mother cells with abnormal numbers of chromosomes were observed. On the basis of this study, it is concluded that microsporogenesis in Coffea canephora is normal...|$|E
40|$|Pentatomidae is {{a family}} of Heteroptera which {{includes}} several agriculture pests that have had different aspects of their meiosis and spermiogenesis analyzed. In the present study we analyzed the morphological patterns of the <b>heteropycnotic</b> chromatin and the nucleolar material of Mormidea v-luteum, Oebalus poecilus and Oebalus ypsilongriseus. The three species presented multilobate testes, with three lobes in M. v-luteum and four in the Oebalus species. A karyotype with 2 n = 14 chromosomes (12 A + XY) was observed in the three species. Several characteristics were common to the three species, such as {{the absence of a}} testicular harlequin lobe (a lobe which produces different types of spermatozoa, previously considered a general characteristic of this family), late migration of the sex chromosomes and semi-persistence of the nucleolus. The three species also shared some characteristics regarding the patterns of the <b>heteropycnotic</b> chromatin and nucleolar material, but differed in others mainly related to the location of the <b>heteropycnotic</b> chromatin in the spermatids and the morphology and distribution of the nucleolar material at zygotene.

Spittlebugs are an important biotic constraint to forage production {{and there is a}} lack of cytogenetic data for this group of insects. For these reasons, we conducted this work, in which the spermatogenesis and nucleolar behavior of Deois flavopicta, Mahanarva fimbriolata and Notozulia entreriana were studied. The males possessed testes in the shape of a "bunch of grapes"; a variable number of testicular lobes per individual and polyploid nuclei composed of several <b>heteropycnotic</b> bodies. A <b>heteropycnotic</b> area was located in the periphery of the nucleus (prophase I); the chiasmata were terminal or interstitial; metaphases I were circular or linear and anaphase showed late migration of the sex chromosome. The chromosome complement had 2 n = 19, except for N. entreriana (2 n = 15); the spermatids were round with <b>heteropycnotic</b> material in the center and elongated with conspicuos chromatin. The analysis of testes after silver nitrate staining showed polyploid nuclei with three large and three smaller nucleolar bodies. Early prophase cells had an intensely stained nucleolar body located close to the chromatin and another less evident body located away from the chromatin. The nucleolar bodies disintegrated during diplotene. Silver staining occurred in two autosomes, in terminal and subterminal locations, the latter probably corresponding to the nucleolus organizer regions (NORs). The spermatids were round with a round nucleolar body and silver staining was observed in the medial and posterior region of the elongated part of the spermatid head...|$|E

40|$|The spatial {{reconstruction}} of the XY pair of chromosomes from human spermatocytes has {{been made by the}} study of serial sections 1000 A in thickness.

During early pachytene both cores have a common ending region, about 0. 4 – 0. 8 µ long. This common end is a synaptonemal complex, and each of the cores forms a lateral element of that complex. The cores become more convoluted during middle pachytene forming "ringlike bodies.

40|$|Anopheles atroparvus has {{two pairs}} of autosomes similar in length and {{morphology}} and two sex chromosomes with equal, heterochromatic, late replicating long arms with homologous C, G, and Q bands.

During mitosis there is a high grade of somatic pairing but X and Y, which form a <b>heteropycnotic</b> mass in the interphase nucleus, have a differential behavior. The chronology of DNA replication was studied in spermatogonia and brain cells by autoradiography. It is hypothesized that the present sex chromosomes of A. atroparvus evolved by accumulation of sex determining factors and gene deterioration resulting in heterochromatinization of the long arms, followed by structural rearrangements. The homology of the two sex chromosomes requires limited dosage compensation which is achieved either as in Drosophila by modifier genes or by accumulation on the short arm of the X, only of female determining factors which do not require dosage compensation. ...|$|E

40|$|Isolated testes of the locust Schistocerca gregaria were {{immersed}} in solutions of tritiated thymidine, cytidine, uridine, or arginine {{for short periods}} to study nucleic acid and protein synthesis during spermatogenesis. DNA synthesis in this tissue is completed prior to initiation of meiosis. Protein synthesis continues throughout the whole meiotic cycle as well as during spermatid development. Meiotic cells, except those in metaphase through early telophase, and early spermatids are also actively synthesizing RNA. The <b>heteropycnotic</b> X-chromosome does not produce RNA at any stage of spermatogenesis. The rates of protein and particularly RNA synthesis decrease as chromosome condensation progresses. Depression of RNA synthesis, however, is not always accompanied by cytologically detectable condensation of chromatin, since very little or no RNA is synthesized in spermatids in which chromatin condensation has barely begun.

40|$|SUMMARY 1. The {{present study}} {{considers}} the parthenogenesis and {{the occurrence of}} males and masculinized females in the totally parthenogenetic phasmid species Carausius morosus Br. The analysis {{was carried out by}} investigating the karyotype and meiosis of females and males of C. morosus and of the bisexual phasmid species Orxines macklotti De Haan and by inducing males and masculinized females of C. morosus. 2. The somatic chromosome number of the female C. morosus appears to be 66. Four chromosomes are long and V-shaped, two of these (X) are slightly longer than the other two (X'). The chromosome number of the male differs from that of the female by the occurrence of only one of the longer (X) V-shaped chromosomes. This chromosome is <b>heteropycnotic</b> during spermatogenesis and may be considered a sex chromosome. C. morosus can be considered to be a tetraploid and may be an amphidiploid. The sex chromosome mechanism is then of the $ = XXX'X', S == XOX'X' type. The male genotype arises probably by elimination of one X-chromosome before the first cleav- age division. 3. In the end chamber ofC. morosus the oogenesis proceeds up to, and including, pachytene when despiralization takes place in the fotmation of the germinal vesicle. The pachytene chromosomes are probably a mixture ofunivalents and bivalents. During despiralization approximately the same number of chromosomal structures as the somatic number may be seen. Meiosis develops without reduction division and the parthenogenesis is thus apomictic. 4. The spermatogenesis of C. morosus is aberrant particularly because of univalent formation during the first meiotic division and bridge formation during the second. The <b>heteropycnotic</b> chromosome (X) behaves like the sex chromosome of bisexual species and the two shorter V-shaped chromosomes (X') behave like the autosomes. 5. The chromosome number of the female 0. macklotti is 38 including two sex chromosomes and that of the male is 37 with one sex chromosome, which is <b>heteropycnotic</b> during spermatogenesis. The sex chromosome mechanism is of the XO-XX type. 6. In the end chamber of 0. macklotti the oogenesis develops normally up to, and including, pachytene when despiralization takes place {{in the formation of the}} germinal vesicle. During despiralization separation of the homologous chromosomes was not observed. 7. The spermatogenesis of 0. macklotti follows the pattern typical of bisexual species. 8. A temperature shock (2 hours, > 40 @ C) applied to eggs of C. morosus induces intersexuality. The first third of embryonic development period is most sensitive. The temperature shock appears to have no influence upon the sex of the progeny of individuals heat shocked during embryonic life. 9. X-irradiation (1000, 2000 r) applied to eggs ofC morosus induces morphological intersexes which are probably gynandromorphs. The first quarter of embryonic development period is most sensitive. These gynandromorphs probably arise through somatic elimination of one X-chromosome. The progeny of individuals irradiated during the second half of embryonic development showed an increased number of males. These males presumably arise through X-ray induced elimination of one X-chromosome in the primordial and oogonial cells. 10. Masculinized females of C. morosus of spontaneous origin maybe either intersexes and/or gynandromorphs. 11. C. morosus may be assumed to be a tetraploid species and parthenogenesis has presumably evolved in a way dependent upon the manner of origin of the polyploidy. If an autopolyploid, C. morosus may have (i) become polyploid and later adopted the parthenogenetic habit or more probably (ii) as a tycho-parthenogenetic species became polyploid and isolated from the sexually reproducing line. If an allopolyploid the course of evolution would probably have been hybridization between two closely related forms with subsequent doubling of chromosomes and adoption of parthenogenesis. These hypotheses are all extremely speculative but the evidence we have concerning the morphology and behaviour of the sex chromosomes makes the allopolyploidy hypothesis more likely. ...|$|E

Although Y chromosomes were decondensed within root meristem in vivo, they became condensed and <b>heteropycnotic</b> in roots cultured in vitro. 5 -azacytidine (5 -azaC) treatment of cultured roots caused transitional dispersion of their Y chromosome bodies, but 7 days after {{removal of the}} drug from the culture medium, Y heterochromatin recondensed and again became visible. The response of Rumex sex chromatin to 5 -azaC was {{compared with that of}} condensed segments of pericentromeric heterochromatin in Rhoeo spathacea (Sw.) Stearn roots. It was shown that Rhoeo chromocentres, composed of AT-rich constitutive heterochromatin, did not undergo decondensation after 5 -azaC treatment. The Y-bodies observed within male nuclei of R. acetosa were globally enriched with H 3 histone, demethylated at lysine 4 and methylated at lysine 9. This is the first report of histone tail-modification in condensed sex chromatin in plants. Our results suggest that the interphase condensation of Y chromosomes in Rumex is facultative rather than constitutive. Furthermore, the observed response of Y-bodies to 5 -azaC may result indirectly from demethylation and the subsequent altered expression of unknown genes controlling tissue-specific Y-inactivation as opposed to the global demethylation of Y-chromosome DNA...|$|E

(Ephippiochthonius) Beier, 1930 and C. (Globochthonius) Beier, 1931 inhabiting this region. The {{results show that the}} male diploid number of chromosomes ranges from 21 – 35. The sex chromosome system X 0 has been detected in all male specimens. The X sex chromosome is always metacentric and represents the largest chromosome in the nucleus. Achiasmatic meiosis, already known from the family Chthoniidae, was further confirmed in males of Chthonius. C-banding corroborated the localization of constitutive heterochromatin in the centromere region, which corresponds to <b>heteropycnotic</b> knobs on the standard chromosome preparations. Morphological types and size differentiation of chromosomes in the karyotype suggest that the main chromosomal rearrangements in the evolution of Chthonius are centric or tandem fusions resulting in a {{decrease in the number of}} chromosomes. Pericentric inversions, inducing the change of acrocentric chromosomes into biarmed chromosomes, could also be expected. Variability in chromosome morphology and number was detected in several species: C. (C.) ischnocheles (Hermann, 1804), C. (C.) raridentatus, C. (C.) rhodochelatus Hadži, 1930, and C. (C.) tenuis L. Koch, 1873. We discuss the intraspecific variability within these species and the potential existence of cryptic species...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{represents}} the first molecular cytogenetic {{characterization of the}} strictly dioecious pistachio tree (Pistacia vera L.). The karyotype was characterized by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes for 5 S and 45 S rDNAs, and the pistachio specific satellite DNAs PIVE- 40, and PIVE- 180, together with DAPI-staining. PIVE- 180 has a monomeric unit of 176 - 178 bp and high sequence homology between family members; PIVE- 40 has a 43 bp consensus monomeric unit, and is most likely arranged in higher order repeats (HORs) of two units. The P. vera genome is highly heterochromatic, and prominent DAPI positive blocks are detected in most chromosomes. Despite the difficulty in classifying chromosomes according to morphology, 10 out of 15 pairs (2 n = 30) could be distinguished by their unique banding patterns {{using a combination of}} FISH probes. Significantly, the largest pair, designated HC 1, is strongly <b>heteropycnotic,</b> shows differential condensation, and has massive enrichment in PIVE- 40 repeats. There are two types of HC 1 chromosomes (type-I and type-II) with differing PIVE- 40 hybridization signal. Only type-I/II heterozygotes and type-I homozygotes individuals were found. We speculate that the differentiation between the two HC 1 chromosomes is due to suppression of homologous recombination at meiosis, reinforced by the presence of PIVE- 40 HORs and differences in PIVE- 40 abundance. This would be compatible with a ZW sex-determination system in the pistachio tree...|$|E
40|$|We have {{characterized}} the meiosis of Olla v-nigrum by standard analysis, performed a NOR study using NOR banding, FISH of rDNA genes and sequential FISH/AgNOR analysis, and adapted the FISH methodology to Coccinellidae. The chromosome number determined at metaphase I was n = 9 + Xyp. At zygotene {{it was possible}} to identify the sex vesicle which presented a deeply stained <b>heteropycnotic</b> block. Chromosome X is much larger than the y and the two combine, forming a >parachute> in metaphase I. FISH analysis using a probe of rDNA genes 18 S, 28 S and 5. 8 S of D. melanogaster was used to map the genes in the sex vesicle. The NOR band showed high gene activity in this region. These results were confirmed using sequential FISH/Ag NOR analysis. The data obtained for Olla v-nigrum agree with the classical hypothesis raised to explain the type of sex chromosome association in a parachute format (Xyp) as being due to the presence of nucleolar material. The chromosome number and parachute configuration during metaphase I in this species agree with the basic karyotype of most Coleopterans. The major adaptation of the FISH method was the simultaneous denaturation and hybridization that permitted preservation of chromosome morphology, an essential factor when the chromosomes are small.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} mitotic and meiotic chromosomes of Cycloneda sanguinea using C-banding, flourescent in situ hybridization (FISH) rDNA probes, and sequential FISH/Ag-NOR staining. The chromosome number was 2 n = 18 + XX for females and 2 n = 18 + Xy for males. The X chromosome was metacentric and the Y chromosome was very small. During meiosis, the karyotypic meioformula was n = 9 + Xyp, and sex chromosomes configured a parachute at metaphase I. At the beginning of pachytene, bivalents were still individualized, and sex chromosomes were associated end-to-end through the <b>heteropycnotic</b> region of the X chromosome. Later in pachytene, further condensation led to the formation of a pseudo-ring by the sex bivalent. All chromosomes showed pericentromeric heterochromatin. FISH and sequential FISH/Ag-NOR staining evidenced the location of the nucleolar organizer region in one pair of autosomes (at spermatogonial metaphase). During meiosis, these genes were mapped to a region outside the sex vesicle by FISH, although Xyp was deeply stained with silver at metaphase I. These results suggest that these argyrophilic substances are of a nucleolar protein nature, and seem to be synthesized by a pair of autosomes and imported during meiosis (prophase I) to the sex pair, during the association of the sex chromosomes.

40|$|Insects of the {{suborder}} Heteroptera {{are known}} for their odor, for being pests, or for being disease carriers. To gain better insight into the cytogenetic characteristics of heteropterans, 18 species of terrestrial Heteroptera belonging to eight families were studied. The presence of <b>heteropycnotic</b> corpuscles during prophase I, terminal or interstitial chiasmas, telomeric associations between chromosomes, ring disposals of autosomes during metaphase, and late migrations of the sex chromosomes during anaphase were analyzed. These features showed identical patterns to other species of Heteroptera previously described in the literature. Another studied characteristic was chromosome complements. The male chromosome complements observed were 2 n[*]=[*] 12 chromosomes [10 A[*]+[*]XY, Galgupha sidae (Amyot & Serville) (Corimelaenidae) and Pachycoris torridus (Scopoli) (Scutelleridae) ]; 2 n[*]=[*] 13 [10 A[*]+[*] 2 m[*]+[*]X 0, Harmostes serratus (Fabricius), Harmostes apicatus (Stål), Jadera haematoloma (Herrich-Schaeffer), Jadera sanguinolenta (Fabricius), Jadera sp.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies {{investigating}} the chronology of DNA synthesis in human chromosomes have indicated a degree of asynchrony {{among the members of}} the complement. The most striking asynchrony of DNA synthesis demonstrated within pairs of human chromosomes is the late replication of one of the X chromosomes shown by pulse labeling with tritiated thymidine in cultures of leucocytes (3, 4, 7, 8). Morishima et al. (8), have presented evidence that this late replicating X chromosome is the same chromosome which produces the sex chromatin body in interphase somatic nuclei of females. Their study covered the late S phase and did not determine whether the asynchrony occurred also at the beginning of replication of these chromosomes in the early S phase. In order to observe chromosomal synchrony or asynchrony in early S phase, it was useful to have a greater degree of synchrony of cell division than ordinarily is found in cultures of human leucocytes, and to know when a large number of cells in a culture could be labeled for autoradiography of the very beginning of DNA synthesis. It is known that aminopterin, a folic acid analog, acts as an antagonist of tetrahydrofolic acid in the biosynthesis of thymidylic acid, and thus inhibits DNA synthesis and subsequent mitosis (5). In the present study, using leucocytes from normal human females, the degree of parasynchrony of DNA synthesis in the culture was enhanced by a period of aminopterin inhibition followed by simultaneous release from inhibition and pulse labeling of DNA with tritiated thymidine in what is presumed to be, for most of the cells, the early S phase. A period of incubation allowed cells thus labeled to complete the S phase and G~ phase and proceed into mitosis. A high proportion of metaphases of such cells was found to have all chromosomes labeled except one, which by size and morphology was found to be in the 6 - 12 +X group (2), and is presumed to be the <b>heteropycnotic</b> X chromosome...|$|E
40|$|Several {{techniques}} including C-banding, fluorochromes {{and silver}} staining {{were used to}} obtain information about heterochromatin patterns in the grasshopper B. coccineipes. Conventional staining showed a karyotype with 2 n = 23 chromosomes in males and 2 n = 24 in females, as well as XO:XX sex determination and acrotelocentric chromosomes. The medium-sized X chromosome was <b>heteropycnotic</b> positive {{at the beginning of}} prophase I and negative in metaphase I. C-banding revealed heterochromatic blocks in the pericentromeric regions of all chromosomes. Silver nitrate staining in this species showed three small bivalents (S 9 -S 11) as nucleolar organizers with NORs located in the pericentromeric regions. CMA 3 -positive blocks were seen in pericentromeric regions of pairs M 6, S 9, S 10 and S 11. Sequential staining with CMA 3 /AgNO 3 revealed homology between the CMA 3 -positive bands and NORs of the bivalents S 9, S 10 and S 11. The CMA 3 -positive block of the bivalent M 6 could represent a latent secondary NOR. The results obtained permit us to distinguish two categories of the constitutive heterochromatin in B. coccineipes. Algumas técnicas incluindo bandeamento C, fluorocromos e coloração com nitrato de prata foram utilizadas visando obter informações sobre os padrões de heterocromatina no gafanhoto B. coccineipes. A análise convencional mostrou um cariótipo com 2 n = 23 cromossomos nos machos e 2 n = 24 nas fêmeas, sistema XO de determinação do sexo e cromossomos acro-telocêntricos. O cromossomo X de tamanho médio mostrou-se heteropicnótico positivo no início da prófase I e negativo em metáfase I. O bandeamento C revelou blocos positivos nas regiões pericentroméricas de todos os cromossomos. A coloração com nitrato de prata nesta espécie evidenciou 3 bivalentes pequenos (S 9 -S 11) portadores de nucléolos com as NORs localizadas nas regiões pericentroméricas. Blocos CMA 3 -positivos foram visualizados nas regiões pericentroméricas dos pares M 6, S 9, S 10 e S 11. Pela coloração seqüencial CMA 3 /AgNO 3 observamos homologia entre as bandas CMA 3 -positivas e as NORs dos bivalentes S 9, S 10 e S 11. A marcação CMA 3 -positiva do bivalente M 6 poderia representar uma NOR secundária latente.

40|$|In this {{investigation}} toxins of the venom {{of the sea}} anemone Anthothoe chilensis (Lesson, 1830) have been studied, from the tentacles and bodies of alive animals collected between 8 and 10 meters of depth in the Island Cabinza-San Lorenzo. Three precipitated fractions with ammonium sulfate and three precipitated fractions with acetone were used to make assays in vitro and one assay in vivo. It was observed that the proteins contained in the venom of A. chilensis have a molecular weight between 14 and 94 kDa. The presence of carbohydrates was evidenced in all the evaluated fractions and by stain PAS of gels SDS-PAGE the glycoproteins presence were detected. All the fractions showed to have hemolytic, phospholipase and proteolytic activities. The acetonic fraction I had the higher hemolytic activity, the acetonic fraction III had the greater phospholipasic activity. When the fractions were assayed on the sea urchin eggs embryonic development, they showed to have morphologic effects like lisated blastules, early exogastrulation, and abnormal prisms and pluteus larvae. Cytological effects like gastrulaes with less mitotic configurations, <b>heteropycnotic</b> nuclei, karyorrhexis and giant nuclei were observed. The evaluated fractions showed to produce hypersensitivity type I in mice, without getting to trigger anaphylactic shock. En esta investigación se han estudiado las toxinas del veneno de la anémona de mar Anthothoe chilensis (Lesson, 1830), a partir de los tentáculos y cuerpos de animales vivos recolectados entre 8 y 10 metros de profundidad en las Isla Cabinza-San Lorenzo. Se utilizaron tres fracciones precipitadas con sulfato de amonio y tres fracciones precipitadas con acetona para realizar ensayos in vitro y un ensayo in vivo. Se observó que las proteínas contenidas en el veneno de A. chilensis tienen un peso molecular entre 14 y 94 kDa. Se evidenció la presencia de carbohidratos en todas las fracciones evaluadas y mediante tinción PAS de geles PAGE-SDS se detectó la presencia de glicoproteínas. Todas las fracciones mostraron tener actividad hemolítica, fosfolipásica y proteolítica. La fracción Ach 1 at tuvo la actividad hemolítica más alta, la fracción acetónica Ach 3 at tuvo la mayor actividad fosfolipásica. Cuando las fracciones se probaron sobre el desarrollo embrionario de huevos de erizo de mar, éstas mostraron efectos en la morfología tales como blástulas lisadas, exogastrulación, prismas y larvas pluteus anormales. Entre los efectos citológicos se observaron gástrulas con menos configuraciones mitóticas, núcleos heteropicnóticos, cariorresis y núcleos gigantes.
