Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{improved}} as a blocker in {{his second}} season with the Eagles. At the start of training camp in 1992, Davis vowed to refuse all requests for interviews by the media in an attempt to focus on <b>getting</b> <b>better.</b> In the season-opener against the New Orleans Saints, Davis helped the Eagles lead the NFC in rushing for the week with 186yards. Against the Washington Redskins in week seven on October 18, 1992, he suffered a knee sprain after quarterback Randall Cunningham ran into him. He was listed as doubtful before the following game against the Phoenix Cardinals, and did not play in the game. He was listed as doubtful again before the game against the Dallas Cowboys in week nine. Otho Davis, the team's head athletic trainer, said Davis was not working hard enough to rehabilitate his knee. Antone Davis was upgraded to questionable two days before the game, and started against the Cowboys on November 1. In the wild card playoff game against the Saints on January 3, 1993, Davis gave up a sack against Rickey Jackson, which caused a Cunningham fumble. Davis started in all 15 games he played during the regular season, and started in both of the team's playoff games. Pro Football Weekly rated Davis as the 26th-best offensive tackle in the league for the season.|$|E

25|$|Groups {{of human}} beings, left free to each {{regulate}} themselves, tend to produce spontaneous order, {{rather than the}} meaningless chaos often feared.

25|$|The {{situation}} kept <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> for Pittsburgh in {{the second}} half. Humphries was intercepted by cornerback Rod Woodson on the third play of the quarter, and O'Donnell's 33-yard aerial strike to tight end Eric Green set up Anderson's 23-yard field goal, increasing their lead to 13–3. But on the fifth play of the Chargers ensuing drive, quarterback Stan Humphries faked a handoff, fooling the Steelers defensive backs long enough to find tight end Alfred Pupunu wide open to complete a 43-yard touchdown. The score was cut to 13–10 and would remain so going into the fourth quarter.|$|E

25|$|The {{clinical}} research on REBT {{has been criticized}} both from within and by others. For instance, originator Albert Ellis has on occasions emphasized the difficulty and complexity of measuring psychotherapeutic effectiveness, because many studies only tend to measure whether clients merely feel better after therapy instead of them <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> and staying better. Ellis has also criticized studies for having limited focus primarily to cognitive restructuring aspects, {{as opposed to the}} combination of cognitive, emotive and behavioral aspects of REBT. As REBT has been subject to criticisms during its existence, especially in its early years, REBT theorists {{have a long history of}} publishing and addressing those concerns. It has also been argued by Ellis and by other clinicians that REBT theory on numerous occasions has been misunderstood and misconstrued both in research and in general.|$|E

Lynn's research also found that [...] "blondes <b>get</b> <b>better</b> tips than brunettes. Slender women <b>get</b> <b>better</b> tips than heavier women.

A woman server interviewed for the blog stated that she [...] "lost my job because my manager said that I didn’t fit {{the look of the}} company, or the restaurant.

25|$|Roosevelt {{was able}} to {{convince}} many people that he was <b>getting</b> <b>better,</b> which he believed was essential if he was to run for public office again. In private he used a wheelchair, but {{was careful not to}} be seen in it in public, although he sometimes appeared on crutches. He usually appeared in public standing upright, while being supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons. For major speaking occasions, an especially solid lectern was placed on the stage so that he could support himself on it; as a result, in films of his speeches Roosevelt can be observed using his head to make gestures, because his hands were gripping the lectern. He might raise one hand to gesture, but his other hand held the lectern.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
25|$|In 211, Cao Cao {{embarked}} on a campaign to attack a coalition of northwestern warlords led by Ma Chao and Han Sui, leading to the Battle of Tong Pass and the subsequent battles. Cao Cao's wife Lady Bian followed her husband and stayed at Meng Ford (孟津; present-day Mengjin County, Henan), while Cao Pi remained in Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei). Lady Bian fell ill during that time. Lady Zhen became worried when she heard about it and she cried day and night. She constantly sent messengers to inquire her mother-in-law's condition, but refused to believe them when they reported that Lady Bian was <b>getting</b> <b>better,</b> and she became filled with greater anxiety. Lady Bian later {{wrote a letter to}} her, telling her that she had fully recovered, and only then did Lady Zhen's worries disappear. About a year later, when Lady Bian returned to Ye, Lady Zhen rushed to see her mother-in-law and displayed mixed expressions of sadness and joy. Those who were present were all deeply moved by the scene before them. Lady Bian assured Lady Zhen that her illness was not serious and praised her for her filial piety.|$|E
40|$|After {{a series}} of gay teen suicides were {{publicly}} reported as resulting from homophobic peer bullying in 2010, Dan Savage and Terry Miller created a You Tube video in which they spoke out against bullying and encouraged LGBT teens to persevere through their high school years. The video went viral, and since 2010 over 50, 000 It <b>Gets</b> <b>Better</b> videos have been created. In this paper, I examine how the It <b>Gets</b> <b>Better</b> Project discourse has opened a space for the participation of heterosexual individuals in a movement directed at LGBT youth. I ask how heterosexual It <b>Gets</b> <b>Better</b> Project video contributors participate in, appropriate, and expand upon the movement discourse in order to include their voices and stories {{in spite of the}} absence of the commonality of experience of belonging to a marginalized sexual identity category. I present a discourse analysis of a non-random sample of It <b>Gets</b> <b>Better</b> videos contributed by heterosexual individuals, utilizing a social constructionist perspective in examining how individuals are narrating meaning into their experiences through their It <b>Gets</b> <b>Better</b> videos...|$|R

25|$|On , John {{returned}} from the Hieronymites Monastery where he had lunched and retired to Bemposta Palace feeling poorly. He was racked for several days by symptoms including vomiting and convulsions. He appeared to be <b>getting</b> <b>better,</b> but by way of prudence designated his daughter, the infanta Isabel Maria, as regent. On the night of 9 March, he took {{a turn for the}} worse and died at approximately 5 a.m. on the 10th. The infanta immediately assumed the internal government of Portugal, and Pedro was recognized as the legitimate heir as Dom Pedro IV of Portugal. Doctors could not definitively determine a cause of death, but it was suspected that he had been poisoned. His body was embalmed and buried in the mausoleum of the kings of Portugal, the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza, in the Monastery of São Vicente de Fora. In the 1990s, a team of investigators exhumed the Chinese ceramic pot that contained his bowels. Fragments of his heart were rehydrated and submitted to an analysis that detected enough arsenic to kill two people, confirming longstanding suspicions of assassination by poison.|$|E
25|$|In {{the hope}} of <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> {{co-ordination}} between his infantry and armour, Ritchie transferred 7th Armoured Division to XIII Corps and directed XXX Corps HQ to take South African 2nd Division under command and conduct a siege of the border fortresses. He also sent forward to XIII Corps the 4th Indian Infantry Division and 5th NZ Infantry Brigade. The Eighth Army launched its attack on the Gazala line on 13 December. 5th NZ Brigade attacked along an eight-mile front from the coast while 5th Indian Infantry Brigade made a flanking attack at Alem Hamza. Although the Trieste Division successfully held Alem Hamza, 1st battalion The Buffs from 5th Indian Infantry succeeded in taking point 204, some miles west of Alem Hamza. They were thus left in a vulnerable salient and 7th Indian Infantry Brigade to their left were ordered to send northwards 4th battalion 11th Sikh Regiment, supported by guns from 25th Field Regiment and 12 Valentine tanks from 8th Royal Tank Regiment, to ease their position. This force found itself confronted by the Afrika Korps fielding 39 tanks together with 300 lorries of infantry and guns. Once again the 7th Armoured Division were not in place to intervene and {{it was left to}} the force's artillery and supporting tanks to face the threat. Taking heavy casualties, they nevertheless managed to knock out fifteen German tanks and stall the counterattack.|$|E
25|$|On July 1, 2012, {{the team}} signed free agent {{veterans}} Ray Whitney, Aaron Rome and future Hockey Hall of Famer Jaromir Jagr. The next day, the Stars traded fan-favorite Steve Ott and Adam Pardy to the Buffalo Sabres for center Derek Roy. When 2012–13 NHL lockout ended, the Stars began an up-and-down season, although {{staying in the}} race for one of the eight playoff spots in the shortened season, which had only 48 games. In mid-season, forward Michael Ryder was traded to his former team, the Montreal Canadiens, for Erik Cole. This shocked many Stars fans, as Ryder was a fan-favorite to Stars fans and had been producing good stats for the Stars throughout the shortened season. Before the trade deadline in early April, the Stars began to falter, and the team's captain, Brenden Morrow, was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins; Roy was traded to the Vancouver Canucks; Jagr to the Boston Bruins; and Tomas Vincour to the Colorado Avalanche to close out the trade deadline, all in exchange for draft picks and prospects. After all of the trades at the NHL trade deadline, many counted the Stars out, as it seemed they were beginning to rebuild and throw in the towel during the season. However, the Stars' remaining young players pulled together to win six of their next eight games, thus propelling the Stars back into the 2013 playoff race. The Stars soon became the new Cinderella team and were <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> as their new-found success went on. However, the Stars dropped their final five games, losing all of them and gaining only one point in their final five games, which eliminated them from playoff contention. The Stars had now missed the playoffs for five-straight seasons, continuing to set the all-time record in the franchise (dating back to the Minnesota days) for most consecutive seasons without a playoff appearance.|$|E
