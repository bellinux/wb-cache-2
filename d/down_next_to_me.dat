I wish Fan, {{that you}} could come here and sit <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{for half an hour}} and read out a chapter from Alice in Wonderland, and then tell me what it all means. It was Sir Isaac Newton, I think, who said of poetry that it was a 'beautiful kind of nonsense'; at all events, if he did not say it he thought it, being a {{scientific}} man. And that is the best description I can give of Merton's talk. That's his merit, his one art, which he has cultivated and is proficient in. He reminds me of those street performers who swallow match-boxes and tie themselves up with fifty knots and then wriggle out of the rope, and keep a dozen plates, balls, and knives and forks all flying about at one time in the air. The mystery is how a woman like his wife--who is certainly clever, judging from the sketches I have read, and beautiful, as I have good reason to remember--should have thrown herself away on such a charlatan. Love is blind, they say, but I never imagined it to be quite so blind as that!" ...|$|E

The kid, the perfect kid would be cold and ruined. Both fire and candle were burning low. Someone {{had been out}} for a new candle, but there was evidently no means of replenishing the fire. The mate still crouched on the hearth, the dull red fire-glow on his handsome face, patiently trying to roast the kid and poking it against the embers. He had heavy, strong limbs in his khaki clothes, but his hand that held the spit was brown and tender and sensitive, a real Mediterranean hand.

In the background were four or five other men, of whom I had distinguished none but a stout soldier, probably chief carabiniere.|$|R

And one day I saw her walk <b>down</b> the path <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and I thought - now where did SHE come from? She didn't know it was me. It was a few years later and I looked a lot different. Then we played a school disco with The Executive and she saw me singing and decided she fancied me. By this time she was that much older and a big buxom thing - and eventually I started seeing her. She invited me in one day when I was waiting for my lift and I was...in heaven." ...|$|R

Speaking about what motivated her {{to record the}} song, Hudson said: [...] "It's unexpected from me, but it still is me. I love how Thicke allowed me to be me but introduced another side. He introduced a more vulnerable side vocally, but yet he put it with the ballad side of Jennifer." [...] In an interview with E! Online, Thicke also elaborated on the recording process, stating: [...] "Luckily, her voice {{is ready to go}} at all times. She showed up, I had this great little song in the spirit of Whitney Houston, and she sat <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and I started singing it for her, and she loved it right off the bat.

Three days later, after a disastrous performance at Whisky A Go Go in Los Angeles, and after a dispute with Liam, Noel went to Lim's apartment in Nob Hill. [...] "He was very upset," [...] said Lim. [...] "I took him in, fed him and tried to calm him down. He wanted to break up the band. We went to Huntington Park to clear his mind. We listened to music. We went record shopping". After bringing back magazines and Snapple Strawberry Lemonade, Lim then convinced Noel to return to Oasis, [...] "San Francisco has a reputation of being a place where bands come to die, like The Band and the Sex Pistols," [...] says Lim. [...] "I wasn't going to let it happen on my watch. I told him, 'You can't leave the band — you're on the verge of something big.'" ...|$|E
40|$|William Vickrey's Agenda for Progressive {{taxation}} {{is perhaps}} his best-known work. It stands roughly half way between Edgeworth and Mirrlees, both historically and intellectually. Edgeworth {{argued that the}} optimal tax (and transfer) system equalized incomes by taxing above-average incomes at 100 percent and transferring the proceeds to those below average. Mirrlees argued optimality {{in the presence of}} disincentive effects, which Edgeworth ignored, placing severe limits on high tax rates. Vickrey proposed 21 tax reforms to make a practical system of personal progressive taxation workable. The two most famous were cumulative lifetime averaging and decreasing power succession taxes. paper reviews the proposals in light of subsequent intellectual and historical developments. Many of the issues Vickrey explored are relevant today whether the tax system is flat or progressive and whether the base is income or consumption. I am honored to be here today to present the Vickrey Lecture. Usually the honoree discusses his or her own research. However, for reasons that will become self-evident, I have decided to discuss Bill Vickrey's work on progressive taxation. I first met Bill Vickrey in 1971. 1 was attending the National Tax Association meetings in Kansas City to accept their first outstanding doctoral dissertation award. The day before that presentation, we attended a rodeo. Who should sit <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> but Bill Vickrey...|$|E
