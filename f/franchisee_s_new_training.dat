50|$|The American Flyer {{brand name}} survives today under the {{guidance}} of Lionel, LLC, although Lionel's advertising and marketing emphasis seems to remain locked on promoting its own O and O27 gauge product lines. True American Flyer aficionados claim this narrow focus is a conflict of interest and prevents the growth of <b>S</b> Gauge among <b>new</b> <b>train</b> operators. Most of the American Flyer-branded product sold by Lionel, LLC today is reissues of 1950s designs utilizing refurbished old Gilbert tooling, decorated in traditional road names and paint schemes used by Gilbert, as well as an influx of some of today's modern railroad heralds. One complaint by longtime American Flyer devotees is that Lionel isn't creating Flyer products that appeal to the toy train masses—rather, focusing instead on a small market of Flyer collectors.|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} autism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) cases has surged in the U. S. educational system since the mid- 2000 s.

To address paraprofessional 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> inadequate <b>training,</b> <b>new</b> behavioral treatments have surfaced, including Video Self-Modeling (VSM). VSM is an effective intervention tool derived heavily from Bandura 2 ̆ 7 s social learning theory. VSM uses edited video clips in which paraprofessionals view him or herself correctly performing target skills. This study used a single-subject, modified multiple baseline design to evaluate whether VSM could improve the accuracy of procedural integrity when implementing DTI.

5000|$|Chalfont & Latimer {{station was}} {{formerly}} served by steam hauled Metropolitan line trains from Aylesbury to London, with a changeover to an electric locomotive at Rickmansworth. The electrification north of Rickmansworth (to Amersham {{as well as}} the Chesham branch) was completed in 1960, with steam trains being finally withdrawn in 1961. British Railways took over the operation of the service north of Amersham at the same time, using Class 115 diesel multiple unit trains. The station had a goods yard, which closed on 14 November 1966.From 1961 Metropolitan line trains at Chalfont & Latimer were formed of A60 and A62 Stock. Up till 11 December 2010 the [...] branch was served by a single four car unit (using Chalfont & Latimer station's bay platform), except for two through trains in either direction during peak-periods. From 12 December 2010, the Chesham service was formed of eight cars with <b>new</b> <b>S</b> Stock <b>trains</b> being introduced.

40|$|Most legal {{educators}} {{reject the}} premise that the primary mission of the law school is to train law students to practice law. Rather, most law professors claim that their primary function is to teach students to think like lawyers. To many commentators, however, the academic community 2 ̆ 7 s antipractice attitude has spawned an unhealthy dichotomy between theory and practice, a division within the academic community, and a chasm between law schools and the practicing bar. Moreover, this dissonance or gap between law school and practice significantly contributes to the fact that most law graduates are substantially unprepared to function as lawyers when they enter the profession. The 1992 MacCrate Report reflects a serious effort by some concerned members of the legal community to grapple with the problems of the legal profession and to narrow the gap between law schools and the profession. The article begins by briefly exploring the reality of this perceived gap between law school and practice. Next, the article describes our study of the DPA 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>New</b> Attorney <b>Training</b> Program and discusses what we have learned from listening to and observing these new graduates struggle to gain competency. The article also compares the preparedness of new graduates in the Kentucky public defender program with that of new graduates who participated in a live-client clinic at the University of Wisconsin Law School or the University of Oklahoma College of Law. In addition, the article focuses {{on the extent to which}} the practical skills and fundamental values identified in the MacCrate Report can be readily acquired in a training program such as that offered by the DPA or in a law school clinical program. Based upon the DPA study and our professional experiences, the article concludes that law students and new graduates, if provided a quality, intensive, educational experience, can achieve minimal competence in a reasonable time frame. Finally, the Article examines Barnhizer 2 ̆ 7 s proposed changes to legal education and his suggested new institutional approaches. The DPA study and professional experiences convince us that Barnhizer 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations are sound and do, in fact, merit serious consideration...|$|R
40|$|M. Ed. Transformation in {{education}} and training in South Africa resulted in a move to a single national education system that focused on outcomes based education. Within Telkom the strategic equity partners, who had joined Telkom from America and Malaysia, insisted that training be provided in specialised 'paths'. This demand, {{as well as the}} demand for transformation from the education department, resulted in old training models being discarded and <b>new</b> <b>training</b> models being designed and implemented. The frustrations of line management as well as operational staff towards candidates who had recently completed the <b>new</b> <b>training</b> model reflected ineffectiveness within the <b>new</b> <b>training</b> model. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the perception stakeholders have of the <b>new</b> <b>training</b> model. A qualitative research approach was used to carry out this study. It included interviews with purposively selected participants, field notes, and was supported by a literature review. The constant comparative method of data analysis was used and provided five categories of information that reflected the perceptions the participants had of the <b>new</b> <b>training</b> model. The perceptions and concerns expressed by the participants were found to reflect an underlying problem with regard to the manner in which Telkom South Africa-Center for Learning develop <b>new</b> <b>training</b> programs. The fact that stakeholders were not consulted when developing these training programs was considered to be the fundamental cause of this underlying problem. The recommendation made in regard to this underlying problem is that proper program planning principles be applied when developing <b>new</b> <b>training</b> programs...|$|R
