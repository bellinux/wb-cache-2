5|$|In 1950 Hicks {{and other}} women based on the East coast of the United States began meeting in an organization, the goal of which was to advance female <b>engineers</b> and {{increase}} female participation in engineering. The organization was incorporated as the Society of Women <b>Engineers</b> two years later. Hicks served {{as the president of}} the organization for two consecutive terms, from 1950 to 1952. In 1963 the Society of Women <b>Engineers</b> presented their highest honor, the Society of Women <b>Engineers</b> Achievement Award, to Hicks. Hicks toured the United States, championing the cause of female <b>engineers</b> through outreach and speaking engagements. She believed that while female <b>engineers</b> would initially be closely watched, they would also be quickly accepted.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{approached}} Sony in late 1989 {{because it}} did not have enough <b>engineers</b> to handle the number of new products that were planned for delivery in 1991. Using a basic blueprint from Apple, including a list of chips and other components, and the Portable's architecture, the 100 was miniaturized and manufactured by Sony in San Diego, California, and Japan. Sony <b>engineers</b> had little experience building personal computers but nonetheless completed Apple's smallest and lightest machine in under 13months, cancelling other projects and giving the PowerBook100 top priority. Sony president Norio Ohga gave project manager Kihey Yamamoto permission to recruit <b>engineers</b> from any Sony division.|$|E
