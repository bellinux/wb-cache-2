Meanwhile, Gruntilda's sisters Mingella and Blobbelda arrive in a large digging machine, the Hag 1, and destroy the boulder trapping Gruntilda with a magical spell. Unfortunately Gruntilda's time spent underground has rotted her flesh away and reduced her to a skeleton. Seeking revenge, Gruntilda destroys Banjo's house before fleeing with her sisters. Banjo, Kazooie, and Mumbo escape the house, but Bottles, who stays behind believing it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>a</b> joke, gets caught in the blast and is killed. The three remaining friends swear to track Gruntilda down {{and put an end}} to her plans.|$|E

25|$|In Trinidad and Tobago the Latin American-derived {{seasonal}} Christmas music called Parang {{is about}} more than just Christmas carols. Parang is about general merrymaking and festivities around Christmas time and the food, dancing and music <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>a</b> part of the parang. The singers of parang visit the homes of family and friends and sing Christmas-themed songs in Spanish accompanied by instruments, usually the guitar, cuatro, maracas (known as chac-chacs on the islands), mandolin, bandolin, violin, bandola and sometimes the cello. Parang is mostly performed during the Christmas season but is also used at other festivals throughout the year, including the Santa Rosa Festival, the velorio del cruz, and the Sebucan festival. Parang includes both religious and non-religious songs and melodies set against the parang instrumentation. Parang festivities typically involve dancing and there are two primary dance styles, the slower castillian waltz and a quicker gavilan style.|$|E
25|$|The {{first season}} of Stand Alone Complex {{focuses on the}} Laughing Man incident, wherein a hacker {{ultimately}} reveals to the Major that he had discovered that several micromachine manufacturing corporations, {{in association with the}} Japanese government, suppressed information on an inexpensive cure to a debilitating cyberization disease in order to profit from the more expensive micromachine treatment. He abducted one of the owners of the company and attempted to force him to reveal the truth on live television, resulting in the hacker live-hacking everyone's vision and cameras at the event to cover his face with the stylized laughing face logo that became synonymous with his image. His popularity spawned several genuine imitators, resulting in the series' titular Stand Alone Complex. When Section 9 discovers that these companies and several Japanese politicians later used the Laughing Man's image to garner public support and profit, they begin a campaign to disseminate the truth, ultimately leading to the Cabinet labeling them as domestic terrorists and forcibly disbanding them, resulting in the capture of several members and the apparent death of Motoko Kusanagi. However, it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>a</b> ruse to deceive the government, and the very alive and well members of Section 9 regroup to bring the micromachine corporations and corrupt politicians to justice, resulting in the dissolution of the current Japanese government.|$|E
25|$|Many teams {{attempt to}} build a {{complete}} team with players with ball control, others with strength, others with speed and others with vision. Traditionally these skill sets are associated with different regions; ball control {{is regarded as a}} South American trait, speed is typically associated with African players and strength is typically seen as the European way. Therefore, prominent clubs scout these regions heavily for rising talent and advise them to have a trial with the club. Football has become a global sport where spectators from around the world can enjoy many different leagues. It has created international rivalries as well as community rivalries; {{yet at the same time}} it has the power to bring communities together. The FIFA World Cup brings the world of football together for an entire month. Through triumph and defeat it is a modern example of nationalism fused with globalisation. In Franklin Foer's How Soccer Explains the World, he explains that national teams create a tribal sense of nationalism amongst fans. This nationalism is shown in wearing football shirts, scarves and flying flags to express pride. When tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup, the African Cup of Nations and the UEFA European Championship bring in supporters from nations around the world, this national pride is a part of globalism. This complex system <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>a</b> part of the global community of football. Football brings players, fans, coaches and clubs together from every part of the world. A prime example of the unifying power of football is the African nation of Ghana. It gained independence from British imperial rule in 1957 and used football to unite the nation. The Black Stars as the national team became known as, hosted the first African Cup of Nations. Ghana has become one of the most passionate footballing nations in both Africa and the world, thanks the unifying power of the sport.|$|E

[...] SpongeBob sings it, bringing back the residents' Christmas spirit. Unfortunately, it was too late when Santa arrives and states that everyone is on his naughty list, except for Plankton, who is the only nice person there is, which has earned him the Krabby Patty formula, much to Mr. Krabs shock. SpongeBob tries to convince Santa that this <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>a</b> mistake, but Santa refuses to believe him, saying he's the worst of all, being blamed for his robot doppelganger's deeds.
