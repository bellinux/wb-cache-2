5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1953–54 season, Plante was well-entrenched {{within the}} NHL. In the spring of 1954, he {{underwent}} surgery to correct his left hand, which he had broken in his childhood. He could not move the hand well <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> high shots and compensated by using the rest of his body. The operation was successful.|$|E
5|$|Although dragonflies are {{swift and}} agile fliers, some predators are fast <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> them. These include falcons {{such as the}} American kestrel, the merlin, and the hobby; nighthawks, swifts, flycatchers and {{swallows}} also take some adults; some species of wasps, too, prey on dragonflies, using them to provision their nests, laying an egg on each captured insect. In the water, various species of ducks and herons eat dragonfly larvae and they are also preyed on by newts, frogs, fish, and water spiders. Amur falcons, which migrate over the Indian Ocean at a period that coincides with the migration of the globe skimmer dragonfly, Pantala flavescens, may actually be feeding on them while on the wing.|$|E
5|$|The {{center field}} fence at Cleveland's Dunn Field was 460 feet from home plate {{until it was}} {{shortened}} to 420 feet in 1920. Even so, Speaker played so shallow in the outfield {{that he was able}} to execute six career unassisted double plays at second base, catching low line drives on the run and then beating baserunners to the bag. At least once he was credited as the pivot man in a routine double play. He was often shallow <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> pickoff throws at second base. At one point, Speaker's signature move was to come in behind second base on a bunt and make a tag play on a baserunner who had passed the bag.|$|E

5|$|L'Hermite's {{three other}} ships all survived the {{hurricane}} relatively intact {{and were able}} to continue their journey to Europe unimpeded, the British squadrons in the area also dispersed by the summer storms. In late September the squadron broke up, Régulus sailing for Brest and arriving on 5 October, the only French ship of the line to enter or leave the port all year. Président was less successful: at 03:30 on 27 September, while sailing in the Bay of Biscay at , Captain Labrosse sighted six ships of the line. This overwhelming force was a squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Louis, which had been sent to the Bay of Biscay to await the return of Willaumez from the Caribbean. Immediately giving chase, Louis found that his ships of the line were not fast <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> the French frigate, which began to outdistance {{the main body of the}} squadron. However one of the small 18-gun sloops attached to the squadron, HMS Despatch under Captain Edward Hawkins was able to keep pace with the frigate, coming within firing range at 18:45.|$|E

The pieces were sold exclusively at its stores; the line almost instantly sold out. The line's second season was equally, if not more successful, with Fred Segal re-ordering its stock midway through the season.|$|E

25|$|This {{effect is}} {{sometimes}} exploited by particle detectors to detect radiation. A single particle of radiation, with thousands or millions of electron volts of energy, generates many charge carrier pairs, as its energy is {{deposited in the}} semiconductor material. If the depletion layer is large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> the whole shower or to stop a heavy particle, a fairly accurate measurement of the particle's energy can be made, simply by measuring the charge conducted and without the complexity of a magnetic spectrometer, etc.|$|E
25|$|Nearly {{twice the}} size of an {{ordinary}} grizzly, Bigfoot for years has levied his tribute of prime steers and no one has been found brave enough or clever <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> or kill him. With a single blow of his giant paw he kills the largest and best animal he can find and he usually takes the pick of a herd. He makes a single meal of the animal, and it is usually a meal that would provide a camp full of men for a week, and disappears, never to return to that locality again that season.|$|E
25|$|Black widow spiders {{typically}} prey on {{a variety}} of insects, but occasionally they do feed on woodlice, diplopods, chilopods and other arachnids. The spider's web is even strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> animals as large as mice. When the prey is entangled by the web, Latrodectus mactans quickly comes out of its retreat, wraps the prey securely in its strong web, then bites and envenoms its prey. The venom takes about ten minutes to take effect; in the meantime, the prey is held tightly by the spider. When movements of the prey cease, digestive enzymes are released into the wound. The black widow spider then carries its prey back to its retreat before feeding.|$|E
50|$|The {{alcoholic}} beverage must be heated before lighting it on fire. This is because at room temperature, the liquid is still below the flash point, {{and there are}} not <b>enough</b> alcoholic vapors <b>to</b> ignite.

25|$|Louis's {{squadron}} had {{sailed to}} the Bay of Biscay {{to await the}} return of Admiral Willaumez from the Caribbean. On spotting the Président, the squadron gave chase but the ships of the line were not fast <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> her. However, Dispatch {{was able to get}} within firing range. Dispatch proceeded to harry Président with her forward guns, forcing Président to turn towards Blanche. Seeing Président turn, Louis ordered Canopus to fire, even though the range was extreme. Realizing {{that the rest of the}} British squadron would arrive shortly, Président struck, surrendering to Dispatch. Président had suffered only minor damage and neither side suffered any casualties. The Royal Navy took her into service as HMS President. Hawkins had been made post-captain two days prior to the action.|$|E
25|$|Sailors might hope to {{supplement}} their meager diets with fish if they were lucky <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> them. The islands frequented were plentiful with potential foods, such as turtle, seafowl, shellfish, and fish. Sea turtle was considered {{some of the best}} meat possible. While at sea, when supplies were low, fresh fish such like snapper, shark, catfish, grouper, albacore were caught and often barbecued, though one would have to be certain not to let the deck on fire. When food was scarce, a rationing system may be put in place similar to legal sailors. In some cases, the only items there were requested of the looted victim from pirates was food and drink. When gold or silver was found, food was a popular item to barter for when bartering was easier than fighting.|$|E
25|$|From {{the end of}} June 1942, the Fw 190 A-3/U3 Jabo (Jagdbomber, fighter-bomber) {{equipped}} 10.(Jabo)/JG 2 and 10.(Jabo)/JG 26, which operated {{with considerable}} success attacking shipping and port towns around the south-eastern coasts of England. These high-speed, low-altitude attacks were almost impossible to defend against, as the Fw 190s came in below effective radar coverage and were often gone before RAF fighters could intercept them. The most successful of these fighter-bomber operations was carried out on 31 October 1942 on Canterbury in retaliation for RAF bombing raids over Germany. In the largest daylight raid mounted by the Luftwaffe since the Battle of Britain, about 70 Fw 190s unloaded 30 bombs on the city, killing 32 people and injuring 116, as well as causing {{a lot of damage}} to residential properties and shops. Only one Fw 190 was lost over England. The most successful RAF fighters used to intercept these attacks were the Hawker Typhoons and the Griffon-engine Spitfire Mk XIIs, which were both fast <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> the Fw 190, especially at low altitudes.|$|E
50|$|According to Melanesian mythology the Abaia {{is a type}} {{of large}} eel which dwells at the bottom of {{freshwater}} lakes in the Fiji, Solomon and Vanuatu Islands.

It is said that those who are foolish <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> the fish from a lake containing the Abaia are immediately overwhelmed by a large wave caused by the thrashing of the Abaia’s powerful tail.|$|R

500|$|Danish {{losses were}} six killed and sixteen wounded, {{all on the}} frigate Sjælland. The Prussian ships {{suffered}} lighter casualties; three men were killed aboard Arcona, and three more were wounded. Two men were killed and four were injured aboard Nymphe, and just a single man was wounded aboard Loreley. Nymphe was the most damaged vessel of either side, having been hit nineteen times in her hull, four times on her superstructure, and fifty times on her masts and rigging. On the night of 17 March, the screw frigate [...] joined the Danish blockade force, and she was fast <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> Jachmann's corvettes. Danish naval supremacy in the Baltic was further cemented with the arrival on 30 March of Dannebrog, which was impervious to any weapon the Prussians then possessed. As a result, the Prussian fleet remained in port {{for the remainder of}} the war; Jasmund proved to be the only naval action of consequence in the Baltic.|$|E
500|$|For {{their first}} few years of service, the Invincibles entirely {{fulfilled}} Fisher's vision of being able to sink any ship fast <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> them, and run from any ship capable of sinking them. An Invincible would also, in many circumstances, be able to take on an enemy pre-dreadnought battleship. Naval circles concurred that the armoured cruiser in its current form had come to the logical end of its development and the Invincibles were so far ahead of any enemy armoured cruiser in firepower and speed that it proved difficult to justify building more or bigger cruisers. This lead was extended by the surprise both Dreadnought and Invincible produced by having been built in secret; this prompted most other navies to delay their building programmes and radically revise their designs. This was particularly true for cruisers, because the details of the Invincible class were kept secret for longer; this meant that the last German armoured cruiser, , was armed with only [...] guns, and was no match for the new battlecruisers.|$|E
