5|$|The {{origins of}} the club stem {{from a variety of}} groups that came {{together}} in 1876.

5|$|Hale {{had spent}} many {{hundreds}} of hours searching for comets without success, and was tracking known comets from his driveway in New Mexico when he chanced upon Hale–Bopp just after midnight. The comet had an apparent magnitude of 10.5 and lay near the globular cluster M70 in the constellation of Sagittarius. Hale first established {{that there was no}} other deep-sky object near M70, and then consulted a <b>directory</b> <b>of</b> known comets, finding that none were known to be in this area of the sky. Once he had established that the object was moving relative to the background stars, he emailed the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, the clearing house for astronomical discoveries.|$|E

5|$|In 1817, a steam packet service {{started to}} run between Driffield and Hull. Three return trips each week were made, but the journey times were too long, and an {{advertisement}} in 1825 indicated that the engine had been altered and an express steam packet service would commence. Three boats were recorded as trading between Driffield and Hull every other day in a <b>directory</b> <b>of</b> Yorkshire published in 1823. Traffic for 1832 included 7,394 chaldrons of coal, 18,173 quarters of wheat, 7,745 quarters of oats, 19,396 quarters of barley and 4,555 sacks of flour. An additional 1,564 quarters of wheat and 8,194 sacks of flour were carried to or from Foston Mill, reached from Frodingham Beck. A regular carrier also operated between the Leven Canal and Hull once a week.|$|E
5|$|The {{date that}} the {{building}} was first constructed is uncertain, with best estimates putting the build date during the Georgian era around the late 17th century as a timber-framed house; this {{is determined by the}} chamfered beams and the rectangular lobby entrance with the front door centrally-located, opening to back-to-back fireplaces with main rooms to the left and right, known as a 'baffle-entry' layout. It transitioned into use as a public house by 1754, which is a common origin of country pubs. It was mentioned in the Melville's <b>Directory</b> <b>of</b> 1858, with Joseph Charlton as the licensee. In 1895 William Sayer, a former landlord of the pub, was killed in a collapse at a nearby chalk mine. It appears on historical maps from 1867, 1897 and various others since, and was labelled as the Royal Oak Public House on all but the first. A number of brickworks were located adjacent to the pub in the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{political}} institutions which hold {{the executive and}} legislative power of the Union. The Council of the European Union represents governments, the Parliament represents citizens and the Commission represents the European interest. Essentially, the Council of the European Union, Parliament or another party place a request for legislation to the Commission. The Commission then drafts this and presents it to the Parliament and the Council of the European Union, where in most cases both must give their assent. Although {{the exact nature of}} this depends upon the legislative procedure in use, once it is approved and signed by both bodies it becomes law. The Commission's duty is to ensure it is implemented by dealing with the day-to-day running of the Union and taking others to Court if they fail to comply. According to the 2014 edition of The Official <b>Directory</b> <b>of</b> the European Union, women account for 33% of higher-ranking officials.|$|E

5|$|Belle's yellow ballgown was {{inspired}} by a similar costume Hepburn had worn in the film Roman Holiday (1953). Hahn and a team of male filmmakers designed the ballgown while consuming pizza and alcohol. Originally, the marketing department ordered that Belles' dress be pink to cater to the female audience, but art director Brian McEntee convinced studio to make the dress gold in order to make her to distinguish her from other Disney Princess, specifically Aurora's from Sleeping Beauty (1950). Art director Brian McEntee suggested that Belle be the only character in her village to wear blue in order emphasize {{the fact that she is}} different and an outcast. The colors Belle wears also mimic her emotions, blue being associated with sadness and loneliness. Blue was also used to symbolize good, while Gaston's red represented evil. According to the <b>Directory</b> <b>of</b> World Cinema: American Hollywood by Lincoln Geraghty, Belle {{was inspired}} by actress Judy Garland's role as Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Julie Andrews' performance as Maria von Trapp in The Sound of Music (1965).|$|E
5|$|UST is Asia's only {{remaining}} Pontifical university. Annuario Pontificio, the annual official <b>directory</b> <b>of</b> the Holy See, in its edition {{for the year}} 2000, lists all the Catholic and or Pontifical institutes of higher learning, grouping them into two categories: Roman Ateneums and Catholic Universities. Only 24 are called Pontifical, and of these 24, six are located in Rome (Gregorian University, Lateran University, Urbanian University, University of Santo Tomas (known as The Angelicum), Salisian University and Holy Cross University); three are in Europe; fourteen in Latin America; and one in Asia, this one being the University of Santo Tomas of Manila. The oldest university to be denominated by the Holy See as Pontifical is the Jesuit Gregorian University in Rome. Although founded in 1551, it was Pope Pius IX who, in 1873, permitted the school to assume the title of ‘Pontifical University.’” All the other abovementioned 23 universities received the title of Pontifical in the 20th century. The University of Santo Tomas of Manila, the oldest of them, {{is second only to}} the Gregorian University to be declared Pontifical by the apostolic constitution Quae Mari Sinico in 1902.|$|E
