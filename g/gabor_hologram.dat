The object estimation algorithm minimizes a convex quadratic problem using total variation (TV) regularization for 3 D object estimation. We compare object reconstructions using linear backpropagation and TV minimization, and we present simulated and experimental reconstructions from both compressive measurement strategies.

30|$|This paper {{describes}} a digital holographic microscope using Zernike’s phase contrast observation method [4] using a hard X-ray <b>Gabor</b> <b>hologram,</b> which is recorded in a computer. In Gabor holograms, {{the most important}} aspect is to reduce the effect of conjugate images. Good quality high-resolution images were obtained after some numerical processing.|$|E

40|$|In {{numerical}} hologram reconstruction like in optical holography, {{there exist}} different diffraction orders, which many times produce difficulties for the image visualizations. In numerical reconstruction, the filtering of the DC term, or zero order diffraction, provides an improved {{utilization of the}} dynamic range of the visualization systems, which is needed for the right displaying purposes of reconstructed images. In {{the case of the}} in-line set-ups, the zero diffraction order has even more devastating effects because it does not allow reconstructing the images itself as in <b>Gabor's</b> <b>holograms,</b> so it is necessary to attempt a filtering of this DC term. In this work is shown a qualitative assessment of different techniques of DC term filtering applied to numerical reconstruction of Fresnel's holograms recorded by means of off-line set-ups.

50|$|Holography {{requires}} temporally and spatially coherent light. Its inventor, Dennis <b>Gabor,</b> produced successful <b>holograms</b> {{more than}} ten years before lasers were invented. To produce coherent light he passed the monochromatic light from an emission line of a mercury-vapor lamp through a pinhole spatial filter.|$|R
30|$|The hard X-ray <b>Gabor</b> <b>hologram</b> is reconstructed by a {{collimated}} beam {{parallel to the}} axis, so the hologram intensity distribution is multiplied by unity. This means that the intensity distribution itself {{can be regarded as}} the complex amplitude and transformed from the hologram plane to the object plane. For this transformation, the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction formula was used. The image wavefront is produced at a long distance from the hologram.|$|E
30|$|We {{proposed}} a microscope using Zernike’s phase contrast observation method {{and a hard}} X-ray <b>Gabor</b> <b>hologram</b> recorded in a computer. Two different sample types were used for demonstration purposes: polystyrene sphere beads with an 8 -μm diameter, and dried HeLa cells. Recording the hologram in a computer {{makes it possible to}} perform computational experiments on coherent X-ray processing. This is very important, because X-ray resources are limited. Moreover, coherent numerical processing becomes easy and simple; creating a perfect phase delay of π/ 2, for example, is trivially produced numerically. Even though a small 0.1259 nm wavelength was used, there is no influence of the external vibrations in image reconstruction. It is also pointed out that the use of holography with the exception of an image hologram can produce images with high resolution, since the pixel size of the CCD detector does not have influence on resolution, but its diameter has.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{application}} of Fresnel based numerical algorithms for the reconstruction of <b>Gabor</b> in-line <b>holograms.</b> We focus on the two most widely used Fresnel approximation algorithms, the direct method and the angular spectrum method. Both algorithms involve calculating a Fresnel integral, but they accomplish it in fundamentally different ways. The algorithms perform differently for different physical parameters such as distance, CCD pixel size, and so on. We investigate the constraints for the algorithms when applied to in-line Gabor digital holographic microscopy. We show why the algorithms fail in some instances and how to alter {{them in order to}} obtain useful images of the microscopic specimen. We verify the altered algorithms using an optically captured digital hologram...|$|R

40|$|We {{overview}} {{an approach}} to providing automated three-dimensional (3 D) sensing and recognition of biological micro/nanoorganisms integrating Gabor digital holographic microscopy and statistical sampling methods. For 3 D data acquisition of biological specimens, a coherent beam propagates through the specimen and its transversely and longitudinally magnified diffraction pattern observed by the microscope objective is optically recorded with an image sensor array interfaced with a computer. 3 D visualization of the biological specimen from the magnified diffraction pattern is accomplished by using the computational Fresnel propagation algorithm. For 3 D recognition of the biological specimen, a watershed image segmentation algorithm is applied to automatically remove the unnecessary background parts in the reconstructed holographic image. Statistical estimation and inference algorithms are developed to the automatically segmented holographic image. Overviews of preliminary experimental results illustrate how the holographic image reconstructed from the <b>Gabor</b> digital <b>hologram</b> of biological specimen contains important information for microbial recognition...|$|R
50|$|In 1946 Dennis <b>Gabor</b> {{invented the}} <b>hologram</b> mathematically, {{describing}} {{a system where}} an image can be reconstructed through information that is stored throughout the hologram. He demonstrated that the information pattern of a three-dimensional object can be encoded in a beam of light, which is more-or-less two-dimensional. Gabor also developed a mathematical model for demonstrating a holographic associative memory. One of Gabor's colleagues, Pieter Jacobus Van Heerden, also developed a related holographic mathematical memory model in 1963. This model contained the key aspect of non-locality, which became important years later when, in 1967, experiments by both Braitenberg and Kirschfield showed that exact localization of memory in the brain was false.|$|R
40|$|Since their {{invention}} in 1948 by Dennis <b>Gabor,</b> <b>holograms</b> {{have demonstrated}} {{to be important}} components {{of a variety of}} optical systems and their implementation in new fields and methods is expected to continue growing. Their ability to encode 3 D optical fields on a 2 D plane opened the possibility of novel applications for imaging and lithography. In the traditional form, holograms are produced by the interference of a reference and object waves recording the phase and amplitude of the complex field. The holographic process has been extended to include different recording materials and methods. The increasing demand for holographic-based systems is followed by a need for efficient optimization tools designed for maximizing the performance of the optical system. In this thesis, a variety of multi-domain optimization tools designed to improve the performance of holographic optical systems are proposed. These tools are designed to be robust, computationally efficient and sufficiently general to be applied when designing various holographic systems. All the major forms of holographic elements are studied: computer generated holograms, thin and thick conventional holograms, numerically simulated holograms and digital holograms. Novel holographic optical systems for imaging and lithography are proposed. In the case of lithography, a high-resolution system based on Fresnel domain computer generated holograms (CGHs) is presented. The holograms are numerically designed using a reduced complexity hybrid optimization algorithm (HOA) based on genetic algorithms (GAs) and the modified error reduction (MER) method. The algorithm is efficiently implemented on a graphic processing unit. Simulations as well as experimental results for CGHs fabricated using electron-beam lithography are presented. A method for extending the system's depth of focus is proposed. The HOA is extended for the design and optimization of multispectral CGHs applied for high efficiency solar concentration and spectral splitting. A second lithographic system based on optically recorded total internal reflection (TIR) holograms is studied. A comparative analysis between scalar and (cont.) vector diffraction theories for the modeling and simulation of the system is performed. A complete numerical model of the system is conducted including the photoresist response and first order models for shrinkage of the holographic emulsion. A novel block-stitching algorithm is introduced for the calculation of large diffraction patterns that allows overcoming current computational limitations of memory and processing time. The numerical model is implemented for optimizing the system's performance as well as redesigning the mask to account for potential fabrication errors. The simulation results are compared to experimentally measured data. In the case of imaging, a segmented aperture thin imager based on holographically corrected gradient index lenses (GRIN) is proposed. The compound system is constrained to a maximum thickness of 5 mm and utilizes an optically recorded hologram for correcting high-order optical aberrations of the GRIN lens array. The imager is analyzed using system and information theories. A multi-domain optimization approach is implemented based on GAs for maximizing the system's channel capacity and hence improving the information extraction or encoding process. A decoding or reconstruction strategy is implemented using the superresolution algorithm. Experimental results for the optimization of the hologram's recording process and the tomographic measurement of the system's space-variant point spread function are presented. A second imaging system for the measurement of complex fluid flows by tracking micron sized particles using digital holography is studied. A stochastic theoretical model based on a stability metric similar to the channel capacity for a Gaussian channel is presented and used to optimize the system. The theoretical model is first derived for the extreme case of point source particles using Rayleigh scattering and scalar diffraction theory formulations. The model is then extended to account for particles of variable sizes using Mie theory for the scattering of homogeneous dielectric spherical particles. The influence and statistics of the particle density dependent cross-talk noise are studied. Simulation and experimental results for finding the optimum particle density based on the stability metric are presented. For all the studied systems, a sensitivity analysis is performed to predict and assist in the correction of potential fabrication or calibration errors. by José Antonio Domínguez-Caballero.
