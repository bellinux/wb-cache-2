5|$|Inspiration for {{the book}} came from a Douglas-fir tree with a curve in its trunk. While sitting by the tree, at his home on Quadra Island, near Vancouver, David Suzuki {{realized}} that even though his family had played on it for years, {{he did not know}} how old it was or how its uncharacteristic curve had developed. Suzuki, a science writer and broadcaster, and former zoologist, speculated that the soil might have slid when the tree was young or that another plant might have blocked the sunlight. He thought that the tree must have endured much hardship throughout its life and made a connection between biographies of people and the story of this tree's life. It also reminded him of an idea he had for a children's book about <b>interconnectivity</b> of life, especially within plants. Along with a research assistant, he studied the topic. Suzuki started to write a draft but a busy schedule interfered so he sought a collaborator. Science writer and former Harrowsmith editor Wayne Grady agreed to participate. Suzuki provided the research, framework, and some original writing and Grady did most of the writing. Together, Grady in Ontario and Suzuki in Vancouver, went through five drafts. Wildlife artist Robert Bateman was brought into the project through social connections between the wives of Bateman and Suzuki. In creating the book, their intention was to illustrate the complexity and <b>interconnectivity</b> of this ecosystem by focusing on one tree's role over time.|$|E

Andreas Dombret of the Executive Board of Deutsche Bundesbank has noted a difficulty in identifying institutions that constitute systemic importance via their size, complexity, {{and degree of}} <b>interconnectivity</b> within the global financial system, and that efforts {{should be made to}} identify a group of 25 to 30 indisputable globally systemic institutions. He has suggested they be held to standards higher than those mandated by Basel III, and that despite the inevitability of institutional failures, such failures should not drag with them the financial systems in which they participate. Dombret has advocated for regulatory reform that extends beyond banking regulations and has argued in favor of greater transparency through increased public disclosure and increased regulation of the shadow banking system.|$|E
5|$|The {{surge of}} air travellers, catalyzed by {{low-cost}} carriers {{and the rise}} of air-transport demands among Indonesia's rising middle class, has put intense stress on Indonesia's aging airports. Nevertheless, there has been some efforts to improve and upgrade airport facilities, such as the construction of Medan's brand-new Kuala Namu Airport to replace the overwhelmed, aging, and accident-prone Polonia Airport. Other newly built airports include Lombok Airport, replacing the old Selaparang Airport in Lombok; and Minangkabau Airport, replacing the old Tabing Airport in Padang. Existing airports that have undergone massive expansion and upgrades include Ngurah Rai Airport in Bali, Juanda Airport in Surabaya, and Sultan Hasanuddin Airport in Makassar. There are plans to build a second Bali airport in Kubu Tambahan near Singaraja, northern Bali, a new larger airport in Kulon Progo near Yogyakarta to replace the crowded and overwhelmed Adisutjipto Airport, and Kertajati Airport in Kertajati, Majalengka, to replace Bandung's Husein Sastranegara Airport and also to serve the vicinity of Cirebon. To improve transportation <b>interconnectivity,</b> the government plans to build railways connecting airports all over Indonesia with nearby city centers. Currently, only Kuala Namu and Adisutjipto airports have a railway connection to the city center, while airport railways are currently under construction in Soekarno–Hatta and Minangkabau airports.|$|E
40|$|In {{cooperative}} software systems, the interconnection {{relationships between}} components are often dynamic and unpredictable and therefore connectors {{have to be}} created dynamically. In this paper, we bring forward the concept of dynamic architectural connector to provide dynamic <b>interconnectivities</b> for components. This paper proposes an automated approach based on software agents to generate dynamic connectors. In the approach, dynamic interaction relationships are established via negotiations and dynamic connectors are generated automatically as high-order entities via taking the behavior specifications and the ontologies of components as arguments. Based on the formal study on the <b>interconnectivities</b> of components, the approach is proved competent for generating dynamic connectors that can satisfy the requirements for providing correct dynamic <b>interconnectivities</b> for components...|$|R

40|$|Naturally-fractured {{carbonate}} karst reservoirs {{are characterized}} by various-sized solution caves that are connected via fracture networks at multiple scales. These complex geologic features {{can not be fully}} resolved in reservoir simulations due to the underlying uncertainty in geologic models and the large computational resource requirement. They also bring in multiple flow physics which adds to the modeling difficulties. It is thus necessary to develop a method to accurately represent the effect of caves, fractures and their <b>interconnectivities</b> in coarse-scale simulation models. In this paper, we present a procedure based on our previously proposed Stokes-Brinkman model (SPE 125593) and the discrete fracture network method for accurate and efficient upscaling of naturally fractured carbonate karst reservoirs...|$|R

25|$|Thus, the Internet {{of things}} creates an {{opportunity}} to measure, collect and analyse an ever-increasing variety of behavioural statistics. Cross-correlation of this data could revolutionise the targeted marketing of products and services. For example, as noted by Danny Meadows-Klue, the combination of analytics for conversion tracking with behavioural targeting has unlocked {{a new level of}} precision that enables display advertising to be focused on the devices of people with relevant interests. Big data and the IoT work in conjunction. From a media perspective, data is the key derivative of device <b>interconnectivity,</b> whilst being pivotal in allowing clearer accuracy in targeting. The Internet of things, therefore, transforms the media industry, companies and even governments, opening up a new era of economic growth and competitiveness. The wealth of data generated by this industry will allow practitioners in advertising and media to gain an elaborate layer on the present targeting mechanisms used by the industry.|$|E

It's like he knows {{what he needs to do}} but can't focus on the task at hand. TV certainly isn't immune to that problem, but shows that get caught up in high-concept premises and big-picture thinking before doing the necessary legwork to establish characters and their relationships tend to be canceled." [...] Subsequently, in May 2016, Warner Bros. gave oversight of the DCEU to Johns and executive Jon Berg in an attempt to [...] "unify the disparate elements of the DC movies" [...] and emulate Marvel's success. The two were made producers on the Justice League films, on top of Johns' involvement in several [...] "solo" [...] films, such as the post-production process of Suicide Squad or the writing process of a standalone Batman film. After the successful release of Wonder Woman in June 2017, DC decided to begin deemphasizing the shared nature of their films, with DC Entertainment president Diane Nelson stating, [...] "Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn’t make sense, but there’s no insistence upon an overall story line or <b>interconnectivity</b> in that universe...

Hybridization of complementary DNA sequences enabled the assembly of multicellular structures with defined cell–cell contacts. We demonstrated that the kinetic parameters of the assembly process depend on DNA sequence complexity, density, and total cell concentration. Thus, cell assembly can be highly controlled, enabling the design of microtissues with defined cell composition and stoichiometry. We used this strategy to construct a paracrine signaling network in isolated 3 -dimensional microtissues...|$|R

These inequalities are manifest at different scales, from the very local spaces of everyday life to global spaces of accelerated mobilities. Mobile spaces, however distant, are connected through common everyday practices and the socio-cultural contexts in which they are produced. In this paper we argue that researching these <b>interconnectivities</b> and commonalities requires a particular methodological approach that accounts for the situatedness of experience. Our focus is on the ways in which inequalities according to gender and generation are generated through urban designed spaces. We suggest that drawing in to a shared material and ‘border’ object, the urban bench, provides a point of reflection on these distant yet parallel expressions of mobile inequality...|$|R
2500|$|One {{particularly}} fascinating {{aspect is}} determining how lexical structures {{are represented in}} the brains of bilinguals versus monolinguals, as bilinguals must map two different languages.

Specifically, the corresponding category centers (examples of typical category exemplars) were closer together for bilinguals than monolinguals. Additionally, bilinguals showed a pattern of having [...] "less complex category boundaries" [...] (p.270), which is where atypical exemplars would be placed, and [...] "more similar centers of corresponding categories" [...] (p.288) than monolinguals.

Also, there is no well-known method to test the accuracy of inferred GRNs. Given these drawbacks, characterizing the effectiveness of different techniques to uncover gene networks remains a challenge.

The bubble network consists of mono- or few-layered graphitic membranes that are tightly glued, rigidly fixed and spatially scaffolded by micrometre-scale graphitic struts. Such a topological configuration provides intimate structural <b>interconnectivities,</b> freeway for electron/phonon transports, huge accessible surface area, as well as robust mechanical properties.

2500|$|Current {{usage of}} the term [...] "complexity" [...] {{in the field of}} {{sociology}} typically refers specifically to theories of society as a complex adaptive system. However, social complexity and its emergent properties are central recurring themes throughout the historical development of social thought and the study of social change. The early founders of sociological theory, such as Ferdinand Tönnies, Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, Vilfredo Pareto, and Georg Simmel, all examined the exponential growth and increasing interrelatedness of social encounters and exchanges. This emphasis on <b>interconnectivity</b> in social relationships and the emergence of new properties within society is found in theoretical thinking in multiple areas of sociology. As a theoretical tool, social complexity theory serves as a basis for the connection of micro- and macro-level social phenomena, providing a level or middle-range theoretical platform for hypothesis formation. Methodologically, the concept of social complexity is theory-neutral, meaning that it accommodates both local (micro) and global (macro) phenomena in sociological research.|$|E

Despite acknowledgement of the <b>interconnectivities</b> between age and gender, accounts of ageing masculinity have been relatively overlooked, particularly in relation to younger and middle-aged men’s perceptions of ageing. However, some evidence suggests that despite a general trend towards increasing longevity, anxiety about ageing is occurring at ever younger ages. Drawing on data from a qualitative longitudinal study, this issue is considered here through a parenting lens in light of the wider social trend towards delayed fatherhood. The article focuses on the experiences of men aged 29 – 54 whose accounts indicate widespread concern about ageing, regardless of their actual chronological age. The analysis foregrounds how these concerns are linked to the continuing association between fathering and physical activity, which highlights the need to consider the implications of advanced paternal age for father–child relationships...|$|R
