30|$|Joining a {{titanium}} alloy to a copper alloy {{has been investigated}} for various processes, for instance, mechanical, solid state, fusion, and brazing joining. For example, Shiue et al. (2004 a, b) reported the microstructure and properties of joints between commercial pure titanium plate and oxygen-free copper plate by <b>infrared</b> <b>brazing.</b> The joint was primarily composed of Cu 4 Ti and Cu 2 Ti phases, and three interface reaction layers, CuTi 2, CuTi, and Cu 4 Ti 3, were observed after <b>infrared</b> <b>brazing.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Infrared heating is {{featured}} {{with a high}} heating rate up to 50 oC/s. It {{is a very powerful}} tool applied in <b>brazing</b> application, so <b>infrared</b> heating has been used to study the kinetics of brazing process in recent years. The importance of brazing Ti alloys has been increased in past twenty years due to the strong demand from chemical and aerospace industry. Based on the previous studies, the use of Ti-based brazes alloyed with Cu and Ni contents is considered {{as one of the best}} alloys in brazing Ti and its alloys due to their high bonding strength. However, the presence of Ti-Cu-Ni intermetallics in the brazed joint has a strong effect on the joint strength, and the reaction kinetics of the joint is still unclear. The purpose of this investigation is concentrated on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study of the <b>infrared</b> <b>brazed</b> CP-Ti using Ti- 15 Cu- 15 Ni filler, and microstructural evolution of the <b>infrared</b> <b>brazed</b> joint is unveiled. It is helpful for industrial applications of Ti-based alloys...|$|R
40|$|This {{work has}} {{developed}} new brazing alloys for joining mild steel to mild steel (SAE 1018) {{at a lower}} temperature. The alloys blends and error analysis were done by experimental design software (Design Expert 8. 0. 7. 1). Design of experiments was done by Scheffe quadratic mixture method. The liquidus temperatures were predicted by calculation of phase diagrams of the alloying metals. The brazing alloys were produced by gravity technique and melted using silicon carbide graphite crucible. The quality of the brazing alloys was analyzed by optical microscopy (OM), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and fourier transform <b>infrared</b> spectroscopy (FT-IR). <b>Brazed</b> joints were produced by torch method with a commercial flux. Brazing temperatures (liquidus) were tracked by a digital infrared/laser pyrometer. Some mechanical properties studied were tensile strength and hardness. Finally, brazed joints produced from the developed brazing alloys were compared to that produced from muntz brass. Six (6) brazing alloys were successfully developed. Zinc and manganese were the main components, to which were added; 3 to 4 %wt silver and 11 to 15 %wt modifying element. The microstructure showed a typical eutectic structure with zinc-rich phase distributed uniformly in the matrix {{with a combination of}} different sizes of dendrite, rounded blocks of compounds and hypoeutectic structures. AAS results indicated minimal out-gassing of zinc and FT-IR results indicated very low presence of atmospheric gas. The range of brazing temperature for best results was recorded from 690. 90 to 735. 10 0 C. The joints produced from the developed brazing alloys had acceptable strengths with improved stress-strain behaviour compared to muntz brass...|$|R
