40|$|With recent {{developments}} in spintronics, {{it is now possible}} to envision "spin-driven" devices with magnets and interconnects that require a new class of transport models using generalized <b>Fermi</b> <b>functions</b> and currents, each with four components: one for charge and three for spin. The corresponding impedance elements are not pure numbers but 4 × 4 matrices. Starting from the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism in the elastic, phase-coherent transport regime, we develop spin generalized Landauer-Büttiker formulas involving such 4 × 4 conductances. In addition to usual "terminal" conductances describing currents at the contacts, we provide "spin-transfer torque" conductances describing the spin currents absorbed by ferromagnetic (FM) regions inside the conductor, specifying both of these currents in terms of <b>Fermi</b> <b>functions</b> at the terminals. These conductances analytically satisfy universal sum rules as well as the spin generalized Onsager's reciprocity relations and can be represented in a generic 4 -component circuit to be used in SPICE-like simulators.

The nucleons (n,p) {{are supposed to}} be non-relativistic and non-degenerate, while the electrons and positrons are ultra-relativistic due to high temperature (T> 6 · 10 ^ 9 K), or high density (ρ>μ 10 ^ 6 g/cm^ 3), or both, where μ is a number of nucleons per one electron. The consideration is simplified because of the analytic connection of the density with the electron chemical potential in the ultra-relativistic plasma, and Gauss representation of <b>Fermi</b> <b>functions.</b> Electron chemical potential and number of nucleons per one initial electron are calculated as functions of ρ and T.
