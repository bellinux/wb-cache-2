You know how, in spite of your care and warnings, it worked on me, though I had more advantages than that poor little man. Dear Honor, it is not you, but myself that I blame.

2500|$|Just to {{the west}} of Old Town is the city's oldest planned {{residential}} expansion. Called by its creators Rosemont in honor of a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania neighborhood of the same name, Rosemont was developed between 1900 and 1920. Rosemont extends from the foot of Shuter's Hill, crowned by the George Washington National Masonic Memorial, away to the north for a dozen blocks to the edge of Del Ray. Originally intended as a [...] "streetcar suburb" [...] connected to Washington, D.C. and George Washington's home at Mount Vernon by electric railroad, Rosemont, instead, became closely integrated into the life of the core of Alexandria. Much of Rosemont is included in a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places that was intended to focus attention on the neighborhood's role as a showcase of early 20th century home building styles. Television weatherman Willard Scott <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{immigration}} waves from eastern Europe {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th century, the Lower East Side became known as having been a center of Jewish immigrant culture.

Vestiges of the area's Jewish heritage exist in shops on Hester and Essex Streets, and on Grand Street near Allen Street. An Orthodox Jewish community is based in the area, operating [...] yeshiva day schools and a mikvah. A few Judaica shops can be found along Essex Street and a few Jewish scribes and variety stores. Some kosher delis and bakeries, as well as a few [...] "kosher style" [...] delis, including the famous Katz's Deli, are located in the neighborhood. Second Avenue in the Lower East Side was home to many Yiddish theatre productions in the Yiddish Theater District during {{the early part of the}} 20th century, and Second Avenue came to be known as [...] "Yiddish Broadway," [...] though most of the theaters are gone.

40|$|Twin studies {{allow us}} to {{estimate}} the relative contributions of nature and nurture to human phenotypes by comparing the resemblance of identical and fraternal twins. Variation in complex traits is a balance of genetic and environmental influences; these influences are typically estimated at a population level. However, what if the balance of nature and nurture varies depending on where we <b>grow</b> <b>up?</b> <b>Here</b> we use statistical and visual analysis of geocoded data from over 6700 families to show that genetic and environmental contributions to 45 childhood cognitive and behavioral phenotypes vary geographically in the United Kingdom. This has implications for detecting environmental exposures that may interact with the genetic influences on complex traits, and for the statistical power of samples recruited for genetic association studies. More broadly, our experience demonstrates the potential for collaborative exploratory visualization {{to act as a}} lingua franca for large-scale interdisciplinary research...|$|R

6000|$|For my part, I find so much {{wisdom in}} the bible--so {{profound}} {{a knowledge of}} human nature, and of its tendencies--counsel so comprehensive and so safe, and this solely {{in reference to the}} things of this life, that I do not believe everything is progress in the right direction because it sets us in motion on paths that are not two thousand years old!
