25|$|In September 2000, Prima Vera {{returned}} to the stage with the show Prima Vera (a)Live, and performed 26 sold-out shows at Sentrum Scene in Oslo, followed by a short tour in early 2001. With {{the exception of a}} sketch featuring Falsk's Ante Valente character, the <b>guys</b> <b>did</b> not write any new material for the reunion show, but performed their most popular material from the old days. Prima Vera also reunited for a one-off Christmas show at Oslo Spektrum in November 2001.|$|E
500|$|The live finale for {{the first}} season saw the {{historic}} bout of Forrest Griffin vs. Stephan Bonnar. Now {{widely regarded as the}} most influential fight in MMA history, the bout took place in what was the first ever MMA event on live and free television. The bout ended in a unanimous decision victory for Griffin and led to the show's renewal on Spike TV. Regarding the success of the show, UFC president Dana White said, [...] "It's amazing to think.... how close we came to not being here today. If it weren't for what these <b>guys</b> <b>did,</b> I don't know if there would even be a UFC. I'll never forget these guys. Ever." ...|$|E
500|$|Mof Gimmers of TV Scoop was {{positive}} towards the episode, calling it [...] "a tense week for Section D" [...] and added [...] "our <b>guys</b> <b>did</b> {{a pretty good}} job." [...] Gimmers also thought Ben [...] "did well on his first undercover mission too, didn't you think? Apart from verging on sympathy for the young brainwashed bombers. Still, he's young. He'll get over it." [...] On Ros' role in the episode, Gimmers said [...] "I don't think I'll {{ever be able to}} say I'm [...] "warming" [...] to such an ice queen as Ros, but I will admit to a growing admiration." [...] Scott Matthewman of The Stage stated [...] "the seventh series of the spy show continues apace," [...] and praised the episode for [...] "the superb performance of Hermione Norris as Ros Myers, fast becoming the twisted moral centre of the show. Both she and Peter Firth's Harry Pearce get some great dialogue every week, so it's a shame {{that the rest of the}} cast aren’t afforded the same luxury." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{referenced}} project {{pulled together}} fluid experts, including some who were {{expert in the}} numeric modeling related to computational fluid dynamics, in a team with computer scientists. Essentially, {{it turned out that}} the computer <b>guys</b> <b>did</b> not know enough to weigh in as much as they would have liked. Thus, their role, to their chagrin, many times was [...] "mere" [...] programmer.|$|E
2500|$|Gregory {{recalled}} of {{his performance}} in the game, [...] "It {{was a good one}} for me today. Some of it was just the ball popping out and being {{in the right place at}} the right time.

[...] Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said of Gregory's recovery of the fumble, [...] "it was just a good scoop-and-score play." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hughes {{suggested}} to Columbus that they cast Macaulay Culkin {{in the main}} role because of his experience with the child actor while shooting Uncle Buck. Columbus met with other actors for the part, by his count [...] "hundreds and hundreds", as {{he felt it was}} his [...] "directorial responsibility". Columbus finally met with Culkin and agreed he was the right choice for the role. Due to Culkin's age, he could only work until 10 PM which created shooting problems for the crew because of the movie's many night-time scenes. The film's stunts also created tension for the crew during shooting. Columbus said, [...] "Every time the stunt <b>guys</b> <b>did</b> one of those stunts it wasn’t funny. We’d watch it, and I would just pray that the guys were alive." [...] Stunts were originally prepared with safety harnesses, but because of their visibility on camera, the film's final stunts were performed without them.|$|E

2500|$|Dale Earnhardt, Jr. {{took the}} lead from Tony Stewart with four laps to go and held off a hard {{charging}} Jeff Gordon to score his first career win at Martinsville Speedway. “Oh, man, been trying to win here for so many years,” Earnhardt said. “Real emotional win. I can’t believe we won here. We’re going to {{drink a lot of}} beer tonight. It’s a real emotional win. This team on pit road was great and Steve (Letarte, crew chief) and the <b>guys</b> <b>did</b> a real good job all day. They gave me a great shot at it there with the call at the end to take tires. I can’t believe we won here. This means so much to all of us. It’s just real emotional.” [...] "That means so much to Hendrick Motorsports," [...] Gordon said. [...] "That's the best way you can possibly pay tribute to those that we lost 10 years ago. To have a 1-2 finish, that's pretty awesome. I {{would have loved to have}} gotten that win to move on to Homestead, but this is certainly a great start for us." [...] "I thought we had the car to beat," [...] Gordon said. [...] "Those last couple of laps were just wild. This means so much to Hendrick Motorsports. It's the best way to pay tribute to everyone we lost 10 years ago. I would have loved to get that win to move on to Homestead. But I'm real happy for Dale. I know this means so much to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The former {{trend in}} Disney's {{hand-drawn}} features where {{the characters and}} cinematography were influenced by a CGI-look has been abandoned. Andreas Deja, a veteran Disney animator who supervised the character of Mama Odie, says [...] "I always thought that maybe we should distinguish ourselves {{to go back to}} what 2D is good at, which is focusing on what the line can do rather than volume, which is a CG kind of thing. So we are doing less extravagant Treasure Planet kind of treatments. You have to create a world but [...] What we're trying to do with Princess and the Frog is hook up with things that the old <b>guys</b> <b>did</b> earlier. It's not going to be graphic...". Deja also mentions that Lasseter was aiming for the Disney sculptural and dimensional look of the 1950s: [...] "All those things that were non-graphic, which means go easy on the straight lines and have one volume flow into the other– an organic feel to the drawing." [...] Lasseter also felt that traditional animation created more character believability. For example, with Louis the alligator, created by Eric Goldberg, Lasseter said: [...] "It's the believability of this large character being able to move around quite like that." [...] Choreographer Betsy Baytos was brought by the directors to lead a team of eccentric dancers that gave reference to make each character a different style of movement. The character design tried to create beautiful drawings through subtle shapes, particularly for most characters being human. For the frog versions of Tiana and Naveen, while the animators started with realistic designs, they eventually went for cutesy characters [...] "removing all that is unappealing in frogs", similar to Pinocchios Jiminy Cricket.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>guys</b> <b>did</b> a live {{show called}} [...] "Live in NYC - The Lost Scripts" [...] {{in which they}} {{performed}} scripts they had written based on Gilmore Girls characters. The scripts featured many inside jokes from the TV show and the podcast.|$|E

5000|$|Finishing fourth, Kenseth said he [...] "had a good day, not a {{great day}}. The <b>guy</b> <b>doing</b> a great day is the <b>guy</b> <b>doing</b> a burnout. We had a great car, we just got a caution when we didn’t need one - we were on pit road {{and then at the}} end when we needed a caution, I saw a car hit the wall and a car smoking so I was hoping to get another yellow and get a shot at it, but just didn’t get it.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Regarding {{performance}} enhancing drugs, Da Silva {{has stated}} he decided [...] "not to take PED's and lose {{because it was}} a matter of character and dignity".

5000|$|Carl Edwards {{scored the}} pole {{for the race}} {{with a time of}} 14.991 and a speed of 127.997 mph. He said {{afterwards}} that winning the pole was [...] "just awesome. This place is really complicated and my <b>guys</b> <b>did</b> a good job making the car drive well on all different segments.” Matt Kenseth, who qualified second, said that he was [...] "just a little off. These <b>guys</b> <b>did</b> a great job with our Dollar General Camry today. Obviously, all of the JGR cars were fast again so thanks to everyone who’s building these things and TRD (Toyota Racing Development) with the engines. In the first round we were pretty good we thought and then the second round we tried something and we were too tight and then the third round we were a little too loose really. We were just that much off, but overall it was a great day and we’ll still get a good pit stop and {{a good place to start}} and hopefully we’ll get it driving good tomorrow and we can race them on Sunday.” During round 1, Ty Dillon got loose exiting turn 3 and slammed into the back of Landon Cassill.|$|E

5000|$|If we {{had wanted}} {{we could have}} gone a bit faster {{but there is no}} point to push it when you don't need to.

It was a good day [...] - [...] everything was brilliant. I am happy that Heikki Kovalainenseems to be okay after his accident. I cannot ask anything more as the <b>guys</b> <b>did</b> perfect work. Kimi Räikkönen, speaking after the race.|$|E
5000|$|Due {{to heavy}} rain, {{qualifying}} was cancelled and thus, Busch won the pole {{based on the}} session's times. He stated that the practice session had [...] "started out slow, but the <b>guys</b> <b>did</b> a real nice job on the M&M's Camry today {{to get us to}} where we needed to be".

In the end that's what you want to do on a day like today, and we made a really good day out of it. Obviously you want to win, but with so many guys having trouble you want to capitalize on a top five run, too.” ...|$|E
