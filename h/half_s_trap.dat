40|$|Furan, a {{possibly}} carcinogenic compound to humans, and furfural, {{a naturally}} occurring aroma compound, {{can be produced}} in heat - processed foods [1, 2]. Therefore, their simultaneous determination is important for food safety and quality purposes. Headspace techniques coupled to gas chromatography - mass spectro metr y (G C - M S) are often used to analyze process - induced compounds. Although headspace <b>trap</b> (H <b>S</b> <b>Trap)</b> extraction has been recently used for furan quantitation in bread crust [3], this technique has not been used for the simultaneous determination of furan and furfural before. This work presents an optimal design of experiments (O - D O E) approach using random blocks for the multicriteria optimization of H <b>S</b> <b>Trap</b> extraction of furan and furfural from sponge cake for their quantification by G C - M S. A bias related to sample preservation was observed during preliminary tests and eliminated in further assays by considering it as a blocking factor. A tailor - made experimental plan including four instrumental factors (i. e. thermostatting temperature and time, dry purge time, pressurization cycles) and two sample preparation variables (i. e. ratio of water and sample weight [dry basis] and total amount [dry basis]), considering the blocking factor was designed. Response surface models (P - value < 0. 0001; R 2 0. 974 for a ll mode ls) resulted in the identification o f most linear and so me quadratic terms and a few second order interactions as influencing the extraction of furan, furfural and their internal standards, d 4 - furan and d 4 - furfura l. Interestingly, one of the samp e preparation variables, namely the ratio of water and samp le weight (dry basis), showed no effect on furfural extraction, while different profiles for furan and d 4 - furan were observed regarding this factor.

40|$|AbstractThe KCNE 1 {{auxiliary}} subunit coassembles {{with the}} Kv 7. 1 channel and modulates its properties {{to generate the}} cardiac IKs current. Recent biophysical evidence suggests that KCNE 1 interacts with the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) of Kv 7. 1. To investigate the mechanism of how KCNE 1 affects the VSD to alter the voltage dependence of channel activation, we perturbed the VSD of Kv 7. 1 by mutagenesis and chemical modification in the absence and presence of KCNE 1. Mutagenesis of S 4 in Kv 7. 1 indicates that basic residues in the N-terminal <b>half</b> (<b>S</b> 4 -N) and C-terminal <b>half</b> (<b>S</b> 4 -C) of S 4 are important for stabilizing the resting and activated states of the channel, respectively. KCNE 1 disrupts electrostatic interactions involving S 4 -C, specifically with the lower conserved glutamate in S 2 (Glu 170 or E 2). Likewise, Trp scanning of S 4 shows that mutations to a cluster of residues in S 4 -C eliminate current {{in the presence of}} KCNE 1. In addition, KCNE 1 affects S 4 -N by enhancing MTS accessibility {{to the top of the}} VSD. Consistent with the structure of Kv channels and previous studies on the KCNE 1 -Kv 7. 1 interaction, these results suggest that KCNE 1 alters the interactions of S 4 residues with the surrounding protein environment, possibly by changing the protein packing around S 4, thereby affecting the voltage dependence of Kv 7. 1...|$|R
