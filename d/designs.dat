5|$|A {{small number}} of pillboxes had been {{constructed}} in the First World War and where possible these were integrated into the defence plans. Some pillboxes may pre-date {{the publication of the}} FW3 <b>designs,</b> but in any case some local commanders introduced modifications to the standard FW3 <b>designs</b> or introduced <b>designs</b> of their own. These non-standard design pillboxes may be produced in some numbers or completely ad hoc <b>designs</b> suited to local conditions. Other <b>designs</b> were produced as commercial ventures.|$|E
5|$|Although flat <b>designs</b> {{have the}} benefit of simplicity, other <b>designs</b> such as {{inverted}} pyramids and cones can be significantly more effective. This is probably because the <b>designs</b> shield the condensing surfaces from unwanted heat radiated by the lower atmosphere, and, being symmetrical, they are not sensitive to wind direction.|$|E
5|$|Broadside {{armament}} {{also had}} disadvantages, which became more serious as ironclad technology developed. Heavier guns to penetrate ever-thicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried. Furthermore, {{the adoption of}} ramming as an important tactic meant the need for ahead and all-round fire. These problems led to broadside <b>designs</b> being superseded by <b>designs</b> that gave greater all-round fire, which included central-battery, turret, and barbette <b>designs.</b>|$|E

5|$|By {{this time}} similar {{political}} and economic concerns in France had led to their own SST plans. In the late 1950s the government requested <b>designs</b> from both the government-owned Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation, as well as Dassault. All three returned <b>designs</b> based on Küchemann and Weber's slender delta; Nord suggested a ramjet powered design flying at Mach 3, {{the other two were}} jet powered Mach 2 <b>designs</b> that were similar to each other. Of the three, the Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle won the design contest with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US <b>designs</b> they assumed were already on the drawing board.|$|E

5|$|Following on {{from the}} site selection, the Scottish Office {{announced}} that an international competition would be held to find a designer for a new building to house the Parliament.

Twelve <b>designs</b> were selected in March 1998, which were whittled down to five by the following May. The five final <b>designs</b> were put on public display throughout Scotland in June 1998. Feedback from the public displays showed that the <b>designs</b> of the Spanish architect Enric Miralles were amongst the most popular.

5|$|The {{architectural}} <b>designs</b> {{of these}} projects have reflected not only the style currents of their time, but the societal debate over the purpose they were intended to serve.

To a great extent, Norwegian architects have found {{the opportunity to develop}} their signature styles through these projects, and thereby also a Norwegian architectural dialect.|$|E
