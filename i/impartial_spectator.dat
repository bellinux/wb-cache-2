Principles of distributive justice and rules of procedural justice form the theoretical framework of the analysis.

The empirical analysis accounts for the different points of views of implicated stakeholders and <b>impartial</b> <b>spectators.</b> Key findings are: (1) The management of a company can increase the acceptance of layoffs if the employees get some participation rights. (2) For <b>impartial</b> <b>spectators</b> generous compensation for those made redundant leads to a higher degree of perceived fairness. But job alliances are not even preferred to layoffs without measures to soften the blow of job loss. (3) Implicated stakeholders accept job alliances and perceive wage cuts as more fair than layoffs.

It is called The Way into Print, but it does not treat, as the reader might rashly suppose, of the best method of getting your name into the newspapers, either as a lady who is giving a dinner to thirteen otherwise unknown persons, or is making a coming-out tea for her débutante daughter, or had a box full of expensively confectioned friends at the opera or the vaudeville, or is going to read a paper at a woman's club, or is in any sort figuring in the thousand and one modern phases of publicity; it does not even advise her guests or hearers how to appear among those present, or those who were invited and did not come, or those who would not have come if they had been invited. Its scope is far more restricted, yet its plane is infinitely higher, its reach incomparably further. The Print which it proposes to lead the Way into is that print where the elect, who were once few and are now many, are making the corridors of time resound to their footsteps, as poets, essayists, humorists, or other literary forms of immortality. Their procession, which from the point of the <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator</b> has been looking more and more like a cake-walk in these later years, is so increasingly the attraction of young-eyed ambition that nothing interests a very large class of people more than advice for the means of joining it, and it is this advice which the publication in point supplies: supplies, we must say, with as much good sense and good feeling as is consistent with an office which does not seem so dignified as we could wish.|$|E
60|$|It {{was always}} on her conscience, in the meantime, to give {{some of the first}} moments of her {{recovery}} to going with Maxwell and thanking Mrs. Harley for the kindness she had shown her in her accident. She was the more strenuous in this intention because the duty was so distasteful, and she insisted upon Maxwell's company, though he argued that he had already done enough himself in thanking her preserver, because she wished to punish a certain reluctance of her own in having him go. She promised herself that she would do everything that was right by the creature; and perhaps she repaired to her presence in rather overwhelming virtue. If this was so, Mrs. Harley showed herself equal to the demand upon her, and was overwhelming in her kind. She not only made nothing of what she had done for Louise, but she made nothing of Louise, and contrived with a few well-directed strokes to give her distinctly the sense of being a chit, a thing Louise was not at all used to. She was apparently one of those women who have no use for persons of their own sex; but few women, even of that sort, could have so promptly relegated Louise to the outside of their interest, or so frankly devoted themselves to Maxwell. The <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator</b> might easily have imagined that it was his ankle which had been strained, and that Louise was at best an intrusive sympathizer. Sometimes Mrs. Harley did not hear what she said; at other times, if she began a response to her, she ended it in a question to him; even when she talked to Louise, her eyes were smouldering upon Maxwell. If this had all or any of it been helpless or ignorant rudeness, it could have been borne and forgiven; but Louise was aware of intention, of perfect intelligence in it; she was sensible of being even more disliked than disliking, and of finally being put to flight with a patronizing benevolence for her complete recovery that was intolerable. What was worse was that, while the woman had been so offensive, she could not wholly rid herself of the feeling that her punishment was in a measure merited, though it was not justice that had dealt with her.|$|E

Absorption was experimentally manipulated using 2 different sets of test session instructions.

The second, spectator-oriented, instruction set directed participants to observe and assess the erotic film excerpt as <b>impartial</b> <b>spectators.</b> The participant-oriented instruction set was found to elicit greater subjective absorption in women than the spectator-oriented instruction set, and women reported greater subjective sexual arousal in the former set compared with the latter. Thus, {{it appears that the}} degree to which a woman becomes absorbed in an erotic stimulus may affect her subsequent subjective sexual arousal. Also, women reported greater degrees of positive affect when they took a participant-oriented perspective than when they viewed the erotic materials as <b>impartial</b> <b>spectators.</b> Thus, participants who were highly absorbed in the erotic film excerpt were more likely to view the stimulus favorably. By contrast, the degree to which women became absorbed in the stimulus had no effect on their reported negative affect.

The common point of view is inadequate because it is subjective and unreflective. In The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Adam Smith offers an account of moral judgment that has an adequate standard for distinguishing between proper and improper moral judgments.

6000|$|It {{was plain}} {{that the enemy}} had retreated to Corinth. The arrival of our fresh troops and their {{successful}} passage of the river had disheartened him. Three or four of his gray cavalry videttes moving amongst {{the trees on the}} crest of a hill in our front, and galloping out of sight at the crack of our skirmishers' rifles, confirmed us in the belief; an army face to face with its enemy does not employ cavalry to watch its front. True, they might be a general and his staff. Crowning this rise we found a level field, {{a quarter of a mile}} in width; beyond it a gentle acclivity, covered with an undergrowth of young oaks, impervious to sight. We pushed on into the open, but the division halted at the edge. Having orders to conform to its movements, we halted too; but that did not suit; we received an intimation to proceed. I had performed this sort of service before, and in the exercise of my discretion deployed my platoon, pushing it forward at a run, with trailed arms, to strengthen the skirmish line, which I overtook some thirty or forty yards from the wood. Then--I can't describe it--the forest seemed all at once to flame up and disappear with a crash like that of a great wave upon the beach--a crash that expired in hot hissings, and the sickening [...] "spat" [...] of lead against flesh. A dozen of my brave fellows tumbled over like ten-pins. Some struggled to their feet, only to go down again, and yet again. Those who stood fired into the smoking brush and doggedly retired. We had expected to find, at most, a line of skirmishers similar to our own; it was with a view to overcoming them by a sudden coup at the moment of collision that I had thrown forward my little reserve. What we had found was a line of battle, coolly holding its fire till it could count our teeth. There was no more to be done but get back across the open ground, every superficial yard of which was throwing up its little jet of mud provoked by an impinging bullet. We got back, most of us, and I shall never forget the ludicrous incident of a young officer who had taken part in the affair walking up to his colonel, who had been a calm and apparently <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator,</b> and gravely reporting: [...] "The enemy is in force just beyond this field, sir." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{consensus}} {{seems to}} be emerging in economics that at least three motives are at work in many strategic decisions: distributive preferences, reciprocal preferences and self-interest. An important obstacle to this research, however, has been moral biases, i. e., the distortions created by self-interest that can obscure our measures of social preferences.

This paper describes a simple experiment that decomposes behavior into these three forces.

For example, stakeholders are less inclined to respond to the generosity of others than are spectators acting on their behalf. This experiment also helps clarify a result in previous research (e. g., Offerman, 2002) that stakeholders tend to punish unkindness more than they reward kindness.

Second, we find that, among the participants who redistribute ex post, a substantial share make a distinction between ex post inequalities that reflect differences in luck and ex post inequalities that reflect differences in choices. Third, we show that the appeal of the ex ante view is independent of how costly it is to avoid exposure to risk. Fourth, we find that the choices of stakeholders and <b>impartial</b> <b>spectators</b> reflect the same set of fairness considerations. Risk-taking; fairness; luck; equal opportunities. ...|$|R

50|$|The <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator</b> sympathizes {{with the}} {{offended}} {{person in a}} manner, as emphasized previously, such that the greatest sympathy occurs when the offended person expresses anger or resentment in a temperate manner. Specifically, if the offended person seems just and temperate in coping with the offense, then this magnifies the misdeed done to the offended {{in the mind of}} the spectator, increasing sympathy. Although excess anger does not beget sympathy, neither does too little anger, as this may signal fear or uncaring on the part of the offended. This lack of response is just as despicable to the <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator</b> as is the excesses of anger.|$|E
5000|$|Adam Smith wrote: [...] "We Conceive {{ourselves}} as {{acting in the}} presence of a person quite candid and equitable, of one who...is meerly a man in general, an <b>impartial</b> <b>Spectator</b> who considers our conduct with the same indifference with which we regard that of other people".|$|E
5000|$|The social {{emotions}} such as [...] "generosity, humanity, kindness, compassion, mutual {{friendship and}} esteem" [...] are considered overwhelmingly with approbation by the <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator.</b> The agreeableness of the [...] "benevolent" [...] sentiments leads to full sympathy {{on the part}} of the spectator with both the person concerned and the object of these emotions and are not felt as aversive to the spectator if they are in excess.|$|E
5000|$|Smith {{also puts}} forth that anger, hatred, and resentment are disagreeable to the {{offended}} {{mostly because of}} the idea of being offended rather than the actual offense itself. He remarks that we are likely able to do without what was taken from us, but it is the imagination which angers us at the thought of having something taken. Smith closes this section by remarking that the <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator</b> will not sympathize with us unless we are willing to endure harms, with the goal of maintaining positive social relations and humanity, with equanimity, {{as long as it does}} not put us in a situation of being [...] "exposed to perpetual insults" [...] (p. 59). It is only [...] "with reluctance, from necessity, and in consequence of great and repeated provocations" [...] (p. 60) that we should take revenge on others. Smith makes clear that we should take very good care to not act on the passions of anger, hatred, resentment, for purely social reasons, and instead imagine what the <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator</b> would deem appropriate, and base our action solely on a cold calculation.|$|E
5000|$|Instead of inspiring love in ourselves, {{and thus}} sympathy, love makes the <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator</b> {{sensitive}} to the situation and emotions that may arise from the gain or loss of love. Again this is because {{it is easy to}} imagine hoping for love or dreading loss of love but not the actual experience of it, and that the [...] "happy passion, upon this account, interests us much less than the fearful and the melancholy" [...] of losing happiness (p. 49). Thus, love inspires sympathy for not for love itself but for the anticipation of emotions from gaining or losing it.|$|E
5000|$|Smith {{talks of}} hatred and resentment next, as [...] "unsocial passions." [...] According to Smith these are passions of imagination, but sympathy is only likely to be evoked in the <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator</b> when they are {{expressed}} in moderate tones. Because these passions regard two people, namely the offended (resentful or angry person) and the offender, our sympathies are naturally drawn between these two. Specifically, although we sympathize with the offended person, we fear that the offended person may do harm to the offender, and thus also fear for and sympathize with the danger that faces the offender.|$|E
5000|$|The {{final set}} of passions, or [...] "selfish passions", are grief and joy, which Smith {{considers}} to be not so aversive as the unsocial passions of anger and resentment, but not so benevolent as the social passions such as generosity and humanity. Smith makes clear in this passage that the <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator</b> is unsympathetic to the unsocial emotions because they put the offended and the offender in opposition to each other, sympathetic to the social emotions because they join the lover and beloved in unison, and feels somewhere in between with the selfish passions as they are either good or bad for only one person and are not disagreeable but not so magnificent as the social emotions.|$|E
50|$|Art critics, such as Lucy Lippard, {{began to}} {{recognize}} Marisol {{in terms of}} Pop art in 1965. At this time, her sculpture was recognized relative to certain pop objectives. Yet, Lippard primarily spoke {{of the ways in}} which Marisol’s work differentiated from the intentions of Pop figureheads such as Andy Warhol, Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, and Donald Judd. Lippard defined a Pop artist as an <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator</b> of mass culture depicting modernity through parody, humor, and/or social commentary. Through an objective attitude, she claimed an artist could maintain a position of ‘masculine’ detachment from the subjects being depicted. As a female artist of color, critics distinguished Marisol from Pop as a ‘wise primitive’ due to the folk and childlike qualities within her sculptures.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{it is not}} {{possible}} to sympathize with bodily states or [...] "appetites which take their origin in the body" [...] it is improper to display them to others, according to Smith. One example is [...] "eating voraciously" [...] when hungry, as the <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator</b> can sympathize a little bit if there is a vivid description and good cause for this hunger, but not to a great extent as hunger itself cannot be induced from mere description. Smith also includes sex as a passion of the body that is considered indecent in the expression of others, although he does make note that to fail to treat a woman with more [...] "gaiety, pleasantry, and attention" [...] would also be improper of a man (p. 39). To express pain is also considered unbecoming.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, Sen {{published}} a book called The Idea of Justice. Based on his previous work in welfare economics and social choice theory, but also on his philosophical thoughts, he presented his own theory of justice that he meant to be {{an alternative to the}} influential modern theories of justice of John Rawls or John Harsanyi. In opposition to Rawls but also earlier justice theoreticians Immanuel Kant, Jean-Jacques Rousseau or David Hume, and inspired by the philosophical works of Adam Smith and Mary Wollstonecraft, Sen developed a theory that is both comparative and realizations-oriented (instead of being transcendental and institutional). However, he still regards institutions and processes as being important. As an alternative to Rawls's veil of ignorance, Sen chose the thought experiment of an <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator</b> as the basis of his theory of justice. He also stressed the importance of public discussion (understanding democracy in the sense of John Stuart Mill) and a focus on people's capabilities (an approach that he had co-developed), including the notion of universal human rights, in evaluating various states with regard to justice.|$|E
5000|$|However, in general, any {{expression}} of anger is improper {{in the presence}} of others. This is because the [...] "immediate effects anger are disagreeable" [...] just as the knives of surgery are disagreeable for art, as the immediate effect of surgery is unpleasant even though long-term effect is justified. Likewise, even when anger is justly provoked, it is disagreeable. According to Smith, this explains why we reserve sympathy until we know the cause of the anger or resentment, since, if the emotion is not justified by the action of another person, then the immediate disagreeableness and threat to the other person (and by sympathy to ourselves) overwhelm any sympathy that the spectator may have for the offended. In response to expressions of anger, hatred, or resentment, {{it is likely that the}} <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator</b> will not feel anger in sympathy with the offended but instead anger toward the offended for expressing such an aversive. Smith believes that there is some form of natural optimality to the aversiveness of these emotions, as it reduces the propagation of ill will among people, and thus increases the probability of functional societies.|$|E
5000|$|Of {{grief and}} joy, Smith notes that small joys and great grief are assured to be {{returned}} with sympathy from the <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator,</b> but not other degrees of these emotions. Great joy {{is likely to be}} met with envy, so modesty is prudent for someone who has come upon great fortune or else suffer the consequences of envy and disapprobation. This is appropriate as the spectator appreciates the lucky individual's [...] "sympathy with our envy and aversion to his happiness" [...] especially because this shows concern for the inability of the spectator to reciprocate the sympathy toward the happiness of the lucky individual. According to Smith, this modesty wears on the sympathy of both the lucky individual and the old friends of the lucky individual and they soon part ways; likewise, the lucky individual may acquire new friends of higher rank to whom he must also be modest, apologizing for the [...] "mortification" [...] of now being their equal:He generally grows weary too soon, and is provoked, by the sullen and suspicious pride of the one, and by the saucy contempt of the other, to treat the first with neglect, and the second with petulance, till at last he grows habitually insolent, and forfeits the esteem of them all... those sudden changes of fortune seldom contribute much to happiness (p. 66).The solution is to ascend social rank by gradual steps, with the path cleared for one by approbation before one takes the next step, giving people time to adjust, and thus avoiding any [...] "jealousy in those he overtakes, or any envy in those he leaves behind" [...] (p. 66).|$|E
40|$|For Amartya Sen, Adam Smith’s {{notion of}} the <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator</b> is a device that brings “distant voices” into our moral {{deliberations}} {{in order to prevent}} us from the parochialism that can limit our views on particular issues.

Tensions arise around issues relating to his interpretation of Smith, a one-sided and undialectical understanding of the operation of the <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator,</b> an ambivalence in Sen’s approach between essentialism and cultural relativism, the capacity for people to carry out the demands of the <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator</b> and its efficacy in relation to real moral problems such as Smith’s case of infanticide.

40|$|This paper aims at {{questioning}} what Sen (2009) presents as {{a theory}} of justice derived from Smith’s idea of the “impartial spectator”. Sen’s tribute to Smith’s pioneering concept of the <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator</b> already {{gave rise to a}} set of criticisms that we divide in two kinds: 1) Sen’s reading is unfaithful with regard to the original Smithian concept (Forman-Barzilai, 2010; Gilardone, 2010; Bruni, 2011; Alean, 2014; Shapiro, 2011; Ege, Igersheim & Le Chapelain, 2012) and 2) Sen’s reading is a weak point of his theory of justice (Shapiro, 2011; Ege, Igersheim & Le Chapelain, 2012). In the paper, we try to address both kinds of criticism. Firstly, we shed a new light on Sen’s reading of Smith and provide a path of reconciliation between Sen’s analysis and Smith’s one. For us, Sen’s <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator</b> is somewhat reminiscent of another figure from Smith’s moral philosophy: “the man without”. Secondly, we show that, in Smith’s analysis, “the man without” is pointless without his genuine concept of the <b>impartial</b> <b>spectator,</b> called “the man within”. We conclude by arguing that Smith’s “man within” could constitute the missing piece in Sen’s analysis of the process which must lead public reasoning towards more justice. Introducing a missing touch of Smith could thus strengthen Sen’s idea of open impartiality in public reasoning for challenging Rawls’ contractualist theory of justice...|$|E

Exploring this theatrical component may shed new light on the debate whether juries are a "good" way of finding legal settlements.
