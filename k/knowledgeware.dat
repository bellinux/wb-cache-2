5000|$|In the 1990s ObjectView was a Windows {{client-server}} {{development tool}} for database access from Matesyslike Borland's ObjectVision, Gupta Technologies's SQLWindows, and Powersoft's PowerBuilder. It {{was bought by}} <b>KnowledgeWare</b> in 1993. In 1994 <b>Knowledgeware</b> released ObjectView Desktop, a scaled-down version.|$|E
50|$|<b>KnowledgeWare</b> was a {{software}} company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia co-founded by James Martin {{and run by}} Fran Tarkenton. It produced a Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool called IEW (Information Engineering Workbench). <b>KnowledgeWare</b> was sold to Sterling Software in 1994, which was in its turn acquired by Computer Associates.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, Synon, {{along with}} Bachman, Intersolv, <b>KnowledgeWare</b> and Systematica, {{was chosen by}} IBM {{to be at the}} heart of AD/Cycle, its {{framework}} for application development and CASE. IBM later acquired an equity stake in Synon.|$|E
50|$|Tarkenton, Don Addington {{and other}} {{executives}} were eventually involved in legal actions {{brought by the}} SEC for engaging in a fraudulent scheme to inflate <b>KnowledgeWare's</b> financial results to meet sales and earnings projections.|$|R
50|$|The second {{alternative}} to developing KBE {{is illustrated by}} the CATIA product suite. CATIA started with products for CAD and other traditional industrial engineering applications and added knowledge-based capabilities on to them; for example, their <b>KnowledgeWare</b> module.|$|E
5000|$|Acquired Atlanta-based <b>KnowledgeWare</b> in a stock-for-stock {{transaction}} worth $74 {{million in}} 1994, {{in the process}} eliminating about 250 jobs in the combined companies. [...] KnowledgeWare's founder Fran Tarkenton joined the Sterling Software board of directors {{as part of the}} deal.|$|E
50|$|SAA did {{not define}} new standards, but {{selected}} from among IBM's existing guidelines and software. IBM also purchased some third party software from developers such as Bachman Information Systems, Index Technology, Inc., and <b>KnowledgeWare,</b> Inc. These {{were intended to}} be implemented uniformly across all SAA compliant environments.|$|E
50|$|Martin {{himself had}} {{significant}} stakes {{in at least}} four CASE tool vendors—InTech (Excelerator), Higher Order Software, <b>KnowledgeWare,</b> originally Database Design Inc, (Information Engineering Workbench) and James Martin Associates, originally DMW and now Headstrong (the original designers of the Texas Instruments’ Information Engineering Facility and the principal developers of the methodology).|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} development tools can be from several sources: from IBM, from vendors, {{and from the}} customers themselves. IBM has entered into relationships with Bachman Information Systems, Index Technology Corporation, and <b>Knowledgeware</b> wherein selected products from these vendors will be marketed through an IBM complementary marketing program to provide offerings that will help to achieve complete life-cycle coverage.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to his football career, Tarkenton served as a commentator on Monday Night Football and a co-host of That's Incredible!. He also founded Tarkenton Software, a computer-program generator company, and he toured the U.S. promoting CASE (computer-aided software engineering) with Albert F. Case Jr. of Nastec Corporation. Tarkenton Software later merged with <b>KnowledgeWare</b> (with Tarkenton as president), until selling the company to Sterling Software in 1994.|$|E
50|$|Prompt and Samuelson found {{success in}} their {{previous}} U.S.-based company, Matesys Corp., which they founded in 1991. It {{was the first}} company to offer Microsoft Windows-based client/server solutions to database application developers. The company introduced {{one of the first}} visual programming tools under Windows 3.0 for the client/server market, ObjectView. In 1993 Matesys was acquired by Atlanta software firm <b>KnowledgeWare,</b> now a part of CA Technologies.|$|E
50|$|In July 2002, OutStart {{acquired}} Concentric Visions Inc., {{a developer}} of enterprise-class content management software.In October 2002, OutStart acquired Trainersoft.com Corp, {{a maker of}} e-learning tools.In November 2004, OutStart acquired Chicago-based Participate Systems Inc., a maker of social business software.In July 2008, OutStart merged with Eedo <b>Knowledgeware</b> Corporation, a provider of learning and knowledge management software.In June 2009, OutStart merged with the world's leader in mobile learning software solutions Hot Lava Software, a company with applications for reaching mobile cellular subscribers.|$|E
50|$|Case {{was among}} the most {{prolific}} public speakers on the subject of CASE during the 1980s, helping launch, among other events, the Computer-Aided Software Engineering Symposium as its keynote speaker for its first two years. Case toured the country, promoting the integration of upper CASE and lower CASE with pro-football great and code-generation pioneer Fran Tarkenton, founder of Tarkenton Software. When Tarkenton Software and Nastec Corporation agreed not to merge, Tarkenton teamed up with James Martin and merged Tarkenton Software into <b>KnowledgeWare,</b> a direct competitor to Nastec.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999, Tarkenton {{was fined}} by federal {{regulators}} {{as part of}} a securities fraud sweep. According to the LA Times, [...] "In Tarkenton's case, the Hall of Fame quarterback and 10 other former executives of his computer software and consulting firm, <b>KnowledgeWare</b> Inc., were accused of inflating by millions of dollars the company's earnings in reports for its fiscal year ended June 30, 1994. The former Minnesota Vikings quarterback agreed to pay a $100,000 fine and $54,187 in restitution. He did not admit any wrongdoing".|$|E
5000|$|Mark McCormack helped Tarkenton invest, {{making him}} wealthy enough to [...] "retire this week {{if he wanted}} to", as New York {{magazine}} wrote in 1971. Tarkenton was a pioneer in computer software, and founder of Tarkenton Software, a program generator company. He toured the United States promoting CASE or [...] "computer-aided software engineering" [...] with Albert F. Case, Jr. of Nastec Corporation, but ultimately merged his software firm with James Martin's <b>KnowledgeWare,</b> of which Tarkenton was president until selling the company to Sterling Software in 1994.|$|E
50|$|The ICAD {{system was}} very expensive, relatively, {{and was in}} the price range of {{high-end}} systems. Market dynamics couldn't support this as there may not have been sufficient differentiating factors between ICAD and the lower-end systems (or the promises from Dassault). KTI was absorbed by Dassault Systemes and ICAD is no longer considered the go-forward tool for knowledge-based engineering (KBE) applications by that company. Dassault Systemes is promoting a suite of tools oriented around version 5 of their popular CATIA CAD application, with <b>Knowledgeware</b> the replacement for ICAD.|$|E
50|$|Martin joined IBM in 1959, {{and since}} the 1980s {{established}} several IT consultancy firms. Starting in 1981 with Dixon Doll and Tony Carter he established DMW (Doll Martin Worldwide) in London, UK, which was later renamed James Martin Associates (JMA), which was (partly) bought by Texas Instruments Software in 1991. He later co-founded Database Design Inc. (DDI), in Ann Arbor, Michigan, to promulgate his database design techniques and to develop tools to help implement them. After becoming the market leader in Information Engineering software, DDI was renamed <b>KnowledgeWare</b> and eventually purchased by Fran Tarkenton, who took it public.|$|E
50|$|The next entrant {{into the}} market was Excelerator from Index Technology in Cambridge, Mass. While DesignAid ran on Convergent Technologies and later Burroughs Ngen {{networked}} microcomputers, Index launched Excelerator on the IBM PC/AT platform. While, {{at the time of}} launch, and for several years, the IBM platform did not support networking or a centralized database as did the Convergent Technologies or Burroughs machines, the allure of IBM was strong, and Excelerator came to prominence. Hot on the heels of Excelerator were a rash of offerings from companies such as <b>Knowledgeware</b> (James Martin, Fran Tarkenton and Don Addington), Texas Instrument's IEF and Andersen Consulting's FOUNDATION toolset (DESIGN/1, INSTALL/1, FCP).|$|E
50|$|The Martin thread was {{database}} design-driven {{from the}} outset and from 1983 {{was focused on the}} possibility of automating the development process through the provision of techniques for business description {{that could be used to}} populate a data dictionary or encyclopedia that could in turn be used as source material for code generation. The Martin methodology provided a foundation for the CASE (computer-aided software engineering) tool industry. Martin himself had significant stakes in at least four CASE tool vendors - InTech (Excelerator), Higher Order Software, <b>KnowledgeWare,</b> originally Database Design Inc, (Information Engineering Workbench) and James Martin Associates, originally DMW and now Headstrong (the original designers of the Texas Instruments' Information Engineering Facility and the principal developers of the methodology).|$|E
5000|$|Kiyoko was {{discovered}} {{at the age}} of 5 when she went with her friend to a photo shoot. The director asked her to step in front of the camera, and she ended up in a national print ad for <b>KnowledgeWare.</b> Nickelodeon spotted her at the Culver City Ice Rink, and she ended up featured in and narrating a short piece about children in sports called, [...] "I'm Hayley, a Skater". Kiyoko continued to hone her skills in middle school plays, and in 7th grade she, after seeing Eurasian girls like herself act in J. C. Penney commercials, asked for an agent. She got her commercial agent and booked her first audition, claiming acting was always just something she did on the side to make money for college and music equipment. Formed in November 2007 and named after her grandfather, Kiyoko created the garage band Hede and released five songs on Myspace and a music video for [...] "Warehouse". The band performed locally on several occasions and split in 2008.|$|E
40|$|Based on {{requirements}} for a next-generation rocket test facility, {{elements of a}} prototype Intelligent Rocket Test Facility (IRTF) have been implemented. A key component is distributed smart sensor elements integrated using a <b>knowledgeware</b> environment. One of the specific goals is to imbue sensors with the intelligence needed to perform self diagnosis of health {{and to participate in}} a hierarchy of health determination at sensor, process, and system levels. The preliminary results provide the basis for future advanced development and validation using rocket test stand facilities at Stennis Space Center (SSC). We have identified issues important to further development of health-enabled networks, which should be of interest to others working with smart sensors and intelligent health management systems...|$|E
40|$|The paper present {{comparison}} of methods for implementing VBA for creation of KBE application in CATIA system. The usage of VBA {{is one of}} the methods of automation of Generative Model creation in CATIA system. Creation of KBE Package forms one of the last phases of the whole process of KBE creation which consists of capturing knowledge necessary for KBE system, formal representation of knowledge, and transferring and implementing knowledge in KBE package. While creating KBE application, Generative Model is being formed and for the purpose of formalization of creation process of that model CATIA <b>Knowledgeware</b> tools are used. In order to have automation of that process it is necessary to ensure programming techniques, including VBA. The suggested 4 methods of implementing VBA for automation of Generative Model creation guarantee greater stability and repeatability of the model...|$|E
40|$|Features {{related to}} shaft faults are {{extracted}} from vibration signals to effectively identify the corresponding fault condition. Feature extraction is accomplished using Fourier Transform, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and multi-scale entropy (MSE). Through the EMD method, the model uses characteristics of intrinsic mode functions (such as zero-crossing rate and energy, to represent shaft condition features. MSE {{is used to}} calculate the entropy of multi-scale of the signal. At a larger MSE scale, the MSE result can be used to clearly identify some shaft defect types. The conventional approach to monitoring of a machine’s health online based on linear time-frequency analysis is subject to limitations, as the mechanical vibration signal is nonlinear and non-stationary in nature. Thus this research develops a diagnostic system based on the implementation of Fourier, EMD and MSE-based methods. In the buildup stage a <b>knowledgeware</b> is created from a database of existing defect types. Finally, the automatic intelligent monitoring system is implemented in a machine tool manufacturing company to verify its performance...|$|E
40|$|At present, {{simulation}} is at {{the heart}} of product development cycle. The simulation is currently used indesign and dimensioning of the mechanical parts. We focusing on the dynamics of the microscopic world and on realizing simulations that capture maximum complicity using minimum computation time and cost. FEM becomes the most useful approach in simulation of mechanical behaviour. For that it requires initial CAD model. It is not easy to analyse complex models. So, it is necessary to simplify the models before simulation. In this paper presents an automatic CAD model simplification approaches. First part of this paper deals with a Rule based approach to simplify the features for that the rules are generated with help of expert’s knowledge and simplification has obtained in <b>Knowledgeware</b> a special tool available in CATIA V 5. Second part presents a Hybrid method approach to simplify CAD model. The implementation of algorithm on Open Cascade Platform is also presented. Finally estimate the effect of using this approach on CAD model. It shows that computational time is reduced with minimal changing the exactitude of results...|$|E
