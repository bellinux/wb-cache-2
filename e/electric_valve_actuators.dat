40|$|Abstract: Camless Engine Valve Actuation (CEVA) {{technologies}} {{have been known}} for improving fuel efficiency, enhancing power output, and reducing emissions of Internal Combustion(IC) engine. Electro-Hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>actuators</b> are used to eliminate the camshaft of an existing Internal Combustion(IC) engine and to control the valve timing of intake and exhaust valves, valve duration independently. This paper presents a research activity like hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>actuator</b> design, dynamic simulations, analysis and adaptive valve timing control of Camless Engine <b>Valve</b> <b>Actuator.</b> Electro-Hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>actuator’s</b> main function is to provide fully variable open/close valve timing. The Camless Engine <b>Valve</b> <b>Actuator</b> (CEVA) system has been modeled {{by means of a}} powerful hydraulic simulation tool, AMESim, which is useful for the dynamic simulations and analysis of hydraulic systems. The designed model has been validated through comparison with mathematical model and experimental results obtained in a prototype test bench. This research is focused on Adaptive valve timing control of Camless Engine <b>Valve</b> <b>Actuator</b> (CEVA) system. A proposed valve timing control in this paper is used to robustly control opening timing, duration, closing timing regardless of fluid temperature variations without high-cost sensors. Test bench data and simulation results indicate that a Camless Engine <b>Valve</b> <b>Actuator</b> (CEVA) system would verify the effectiveness and feasibility of a fully variable valve timing technology...|$|R

Manually operated valves require someone in attendance to adjust them using a direct or geared mechanism attached to the <b>valve</b> stem.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{need for}} more energy {{in the world is}} making the oil companies search for hydrocarbons in deeper water and with longer distances between the well and platform(step-out) never experienced before. Current systems are designed to operate in deepwater with relatively short step-outs. Since the search now is starting to exceed this, the operational conditions are changed and the electro-hydraulic system is closing in on its operational limits. Hence, the increasing need for a system that supports the long step-outs and the deeper water. Aker Kvaerner has started looking into the development for an All Electric Subsea Production system. In co-operation with Aker Kvaerner Subsea, a functional design specification for an <b>electric</b> subsea gate <b>valve</b> <b>actuator</b> has been developed and included in this thesis. This functional design specification will include all the requirements that a subsea electric actuator must conform to. This includes the operational requirements, size limitations, failsafe needs etc. Based on this specification, a design for a electric actuator and including motor driver control system layout on the all electric x-mas tree is proposed {{as a part of the}} All Electric Subsea Production system. The actuator will be used to operate the gate valves on a x-mas tree which controls the flow of hydrocarbons through the valves into the pipelines. Most of the existing subsea gate <b>valve</b> <b>actuators</b> are currently using hydraulic oil to operate the valves linearly. Here a concept is being suggested in replacement of the hydraulic fluid, while still complying with the necessary design specification. A number of electrical machines for potential use in this application are presented and evaluated. A Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine is being investigated further. These machines can be custom made, and can also be made with built in redundancy. Calculation of size for the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine has been done, to determine suitability within the space limitation of the apparatus. Two layouts for controlling the actuators on the all electric x-mas tree are proposed. These two are also evaluated against the standards made for subsea production systems and the no 'single point failure' requirement made by the industry. The chosen solution proposed for controlling the electrical actuators is an integrated design, where all actuators have their own motor driver inside. This thesis conclude that an electrical actuator will be technically and mechanically possible to build(from an electrical perspective), using the design and control layout proposed. </p...|$|R

5000|$|As the {{pneumatic}} operation of valves, compared to motorised operation, has cost and reliability advantages, pneumatic actuation {{is still an}} industry standard. To allow the construction of hybrid systems, where the 4-20 mA is generated by the controller, but {{enables the use of}} pneumatic valves, a range of current to pressure (I to P) converters are available from manufacturers. These are usually located locally to the control valve and convert 4-20 mA to 3-15 psi (or (0.2 - 1.0 bar).This signal is then fed to the <b>valve</b> <b>actuator</b> or more commonly, a pneumatic positioner. This is a dedicated controller with a pneumatic nozzle and flapper arrangement and a mechanical linkage to sense the <b>valve</b> <b>actuator</b> movement. This ensures that problems of friction are overcome and the valve control element moves to the desired position, by comparing the actual valve regulating element position against the desired value; hence the name [...] "positioner". As a mechanical linkage is used for this, the positioner has to be mounted on the valve body. A positioner also allows the use of higher air pressures for valve actuation, which is particularly useful with cylinder type <b>valve</b> <b>actuators.</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of performances of <b>electric</b> <b>actuators</b> for control <b>valves</b> in industrial control loops. The objective of the recent collaboration between University of Pisa and CLUI AS is to assess potentials and benefits of control <b>valve</b> <b>electric</b> <b>actuators,</b> by testing and comparing devices of different typologies and manufacturers. As a premise, {{it should be noted}} that pneumatic actuators still represent the most commonly used actuation devices in the process industry, mainly because of high performance and fast response. In recent years, electric actuators, as a result of their enhanced features, are finding increasing applications in the area of process control. Anyway, some practical aspects, such as the degradation of the valve seat, an excessive tightening of the seal, and an expansion of metallic components due to high temperature operation, can cause malfunctions, and in particular, phenomena of wear and friction within a control valve regardless of the type of actuator. In fact, pneumatic and <b>electric</b> <b>valves</b> differ only in the actuation system; while the valve body, subject to most of the friction forces, is absolutely the same. In detail, the present work has been focused on the analysis of a recent electric actuator installed on an rotary control valve, and tested in the last biennium in an pilot plant, owned by ENEL in Livorno (Italy). Specific experimental tests were carried out, by collecting operating data in open-loop and closed-loop mode. The validity and effectiveness of the performance was verified in nominal and faulty conditions, in particular, by introducing a dead-band. Furthermore, performances of this electric actuator was compared with that of a conventional pneumatic actuator with positioner, coupled to the same valve, installed on the same plant line, and tested in equivalent experimental conditions. In general terms, it has been confirmed that the <b>electric</b> <b>actuator</b> for control <b>valve</b> is a promising technology, and its performance are fully comparable - if not superior - to those of the pneumatic actuator. In particular, some simple performance indices assume similar numerical values, and also the time trends of the positional error and the limit cycles registered on polar diagram between valve input and output signals are similar...|$|R
