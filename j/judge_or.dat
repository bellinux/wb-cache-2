5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} a statute {{is an attempt}} by the {{legislature}} to prevent an act or decision by a public authority from being challenged before the courts. Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage. One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause, which is inserted into a statute to indicate that the decision of a particular <b>judge</b> <b>or</b> tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E
5|$|In a book {{he wrote}} in the 1970s, Audisio argued that the {{decision}} to execute Mussolini taken at the meeting in Dongo of the partisan leaders on 28 April constituted a valid judgment of a tribunal under Article 15 of the CNLAI's ordinance on the Constitution of Courts of War. However, the lack of a <b>judge</b> <b>or</b> a Commissario di Guerra (required by the ordinance to be present) casts doubt on this assertion.|$|E

5|$|Section 4 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 had {{provided}} that two judges or justices {{would constitute a}} quorum. The practice of sending a single circuit rider was explicitly authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1793, but was already common before 1793. Under the Judicial Act of 1802, a single judge (either the district <b>judge</b> <b>or</b> the circuit rider) could preside alone.|$|E
5|$|The only court {{shows that}} outnumber Judge Judys seasons are The People's Court and Divorce Court—both {{of which have}} {{suffered}} cancellation(s) and gone through multiple judges or arbitrators, whereas Judge Judy has not. Thus, Judge Judy boasts the longest individual production life of any court show. Moreover, Sheindlin is the longest serving <b>judge</b> <b>or</b> arbitrator in courtroom-themed programming history—a distinction that rewarded Sheindlin {{a place in the}} Guinness World Records in September 2015 as part of the program's 20th anniversary season.|$|E
5|$|Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, the United States circuit {{courts were}} {{composed}} of a stationary United States district court judge and any two Supreme Court justices riding circuit. If one <b>judge</b> <b>or</b> justice disagreed with the other two, the majority prevailed. If only one Supreme Court justice could attend (as was authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1793), and a division arose between the district judge and the Supreme Court justice, the practice was to hold the case over until the next term. If a one-to-one division persisted with a different circuit riding justice, {{the opinion of the}} previous circuit rider broke the tie. Following a brief intermezzo with the soon-repealed Midnight Judges Act of 1801 (which briefly abolished circuit riding), under the Judiciary Act of 1802, the circuit courts were {{composed of a}} stationary district judge and one Supreme Court justice assigned to the circuit. But, a single judge (either the district <b>judge</b> <b>or</b> the circuit rider) could preside alone. In cases where both judges sat, though, one-to-one divisions {{were less likely to be}} resolved by continuing the case until the next term because the circuit riding justice would be the same (barring a change in membership on the Court).|$|E

If one <b>judge</b> <b>or</b> justice {{disagreed}} with the other two, the majority prevailed. If only one Supreme Court justice could attend, and a division arose between the district judge and the Supreme Court justice, the practiceas required by the Judiciary Act of 1793was to hold the case over until the next term. If a one-to-one division persisted with a different circuit riding justice, {{the opinion of the}} previous circuit rider broke the tie. After 1802, in cases where both judges sat, though, one-to-one divisions {{were less likely to be}} resolved by continuing the case until the next term because the circuit-riding justice would be the same (barring a change in membership on the Court).|$|E
