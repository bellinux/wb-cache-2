40|$|The {{following}} {{paper is}} {{an analysis of}} the decorated ceramics associated with site 15 SP 202, a Mississippi Period site in Spencer County, Kentucky. The ceramics were then used to determine whether the site had been classified correctly by its original investigator, due to the ambiguity often associated with assigning temporal and cultural affiliation to late prehistoric sites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ohio River region. After the initial analysis, the author compared and contrasted 15 SP 202 with other known and more fully excavated Mississippian sites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region, <b>in</b> an attempt to integrate <b>the</b> site <b>in</b> question into a wider regional context. Ultimately, the author posits that site 15 SP 202 adds to the growing body of archaeological work that supports a sustained, substantial, and unique Mississippian occupation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ohio River region...|$|R
