The hydrogen plant at Vemork was the first mass producer of heavy water, and in 1939 IG Farben, who owned 25% of Norsk Hydro at the time, asked to import five liters of heavy water, but was denied {{due to lack of}} an <b>export</b> <b>license.</b> In 1939–40 production at Vemork was 20 kilograms, by 1942 production had increased to five kilograms per day.|$|E
5|$|Stelae {{have become}} {{threatened}} {{in modern times}} by plundering for sale on the international art market. Many stelae are found in remote areas and their size and weight prevents them from being removed intact. Various methods are used to cut or break a stela for easier transport, including power saws, chisels, acid and heat. When a monument is well preserved, the looters attempt to cut off its face for transport. Even when successful, this results in damage to inscriptions {{on the sides of}} the stela. At worst, this method results in complete fragmentation of the stela face with any recoverable sculpture removed for sale. Traceable fragments of well known monuments have been purchased by American museums and private collectors in the past. When such monuments are removed from their original context, their historical meaning is lost. Although museums have justified their acquisition of stelae fragments with the argument that such objects are better preserved in an institution, no stela has been sold in as good a condition as it was in its original location. After 1970 there was a sharp drop in Maya stelae available on the New York art market due to the ratification of a treaty with Mexico that guarantees the return of stolen pre-Columbian sculpture that was removed from the country after the ratification date. In the early 1970s some museums, such as that of the University of Pennsylvania, responded to international criticism by no longer purchasing archaeological artefacts that lack a legally documented history, including place of origin, previous owners and an <b>export</b> <b>license.</b> Harvard University also instituted a similar policy in the early 1970s.|$|E

25|$|The {{loss of the}} D-LZ 129 Hindenburg at Lakehurst on 6 May 1937 {{shattered}} public {{faith in}} the safety of hydrogen-filled airships making the continuation of their commercial passenger operations unsustainable unless the Graf Zeppelin and the still under construction LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin II could convert to non-flammable helium, the only alternative lifting gas for airships. Unlike the relatively inexpensive and universally available hydrogen, however, {{the vast majority of the}} world's available supplies of the much more costly, less buoyant, and harder to produce helium (which is an extracted byproduct of mined natural gas) were controlled by the United States. Since 1925, the exportation of helium had also been tightly restricted by Congress, although there is no record that the German Government had ever applied for an <b>export</b> <b>license</b> for helium to use in its airships prior to the Hindenburg's crash and fire.|$|E
25|$|The {{geological}} {{wealth of}} the island lay in its rich deposits of rutile, ilmenite, zircon and monazite. Sand mining leases were first granted in 1950, and mining continued until 1977. Without public knowledge the Queensland Government granted mining leases to the American mining company Dillingham-Murphyores in the 1960s. In 1971, the Fraser Island Defense Organisation (FIDO) opposed the granting of more leases to the company. Despite more than 1,300 submissions that {{were made to the}} local mining warden objecting to new leases, the submission was granted. FIDO took the case to the High Court of Australia which overruled the decision noting that the public interest was not being upheld. Dillingham-Murphyores continued mining. The Whitlam Government established Australia's first environmental impact inquiry which recommended that mining cease. Eventually Malcolm Fraser canceled the company's mineral <b>export</b> <b>license</b> which halted mining on the island. This represented a significant win for the conservation movement in Australia. Fraser Island then became the first place {{to be included in the}} Australian Heritage Commission's Register of the National Estate.|$|E
25|$|The missing {{double eagle}} was {{acquired}} by King Farouk of Egypt, who was a voracious collector of many things, including imperial Fabergé eggs, antique aspirin bottles, paperweights, postage stamps—and coins, {{of which he had}} a collection of over 8,500. In 1944 Farouk purchased a 1933 double eagle, and in strict adherence with the law, his ministers applied to the United States Treasury Department for an <b>export</b> <b>license</b> for the coin. Mistakenly, just days before the mint theft was discovered, the license was granted. The Treasury Department attempted to work through diplomatic channels to request the return of the coin from Egypt, but World War II delayed their efforts for several years. In 1952, King Farouk was deposed in a coup d'etat, and many of his possessions were made available for public auction (run by Sotheby's) – including the double eagle coin. The United States government requested the return of the coin, and the Egyptian government stated that it would comply with the request. However, the coin disappeared and was not seen again in Egypt.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Spain looked towards its European neighbors {{for a new}} tank. The Spanish {{government}} first approached Krauss-Maffei, the German manufacturer of the Leopard 1, and the company applied for an <b>export</b> <b>license</b> from the German Economics Ministry. Spain's status as a non-NATO country meant {{that the decision to}} grant the <b>export</b> <b>license</b> had to be reviewed by the Bundessicherheitsrat (Federal Security Council), or the BSR, which was responsible for the coordination of the national defense policy. [...] Ultimately, the council ruled that Krauss-Maffei could sign an export contract with Spain.

Contemporary reports state that the agreement was based on assurances that the core of the engine, the part that GE was developing from the military F101, would be built in the U.S. and then transported to France {{in order to protect the}} sensitive technologies. The joint venture also agreed to pay the U.S. an $80million royalty fee (calculated at $20,000 per engine predicted to be built) as repayment for the development money provided by the government for the F101 engine core.

500|$|A {{major reason}} for GE's {{interest}} in the collaboration, rather than building a 10-ton engine on their own, was that the SNECMA project was {{the only source of}} development funds for an engine in this class at this particular time. GE was initially considering only contributing technology from its CF6 engine rather than its much more advanced F101 engine, developed for the B-1 Lancer supersonic bomber. The company was faced with a dilemma when the United States Air Force (USAF) announced its Advanced Medium STOL Transport (AMST) project in 1972 which included funding {{for the development of a}} 10-ton engine – either to build a [...] "limited" [...] technology 10-ton engine with SNECMA, or a similar engine with [...] "advanced" [...] technology on their own.
