It depicts the growth of organized crime in the Cidade de Deus suburb of Rio de Janeiro, between the end of the 1960s {{and the beginning of the}} 1980s, with the closure of the film depicting the war between the drug dealer Li'l Zé and vigilante-turned-criminal Knockout Ned.

I think his report is outstanding, and certainly leaves no doubt in one's mind about the demand for rhino horn and the need for some clear thinking on the whole subject. My own view remains the same which is the position of the Wilderness Foundation and that there should be limited regulated trade in the horns that have been gathered through natural mortality.|$|R

40|$|Women in Local Politics: The Reflection of Master Suppression Techniques The {{causes of}} the low {{political}} participation {{of women in the}} Czech local politics have to be viewed as a complex and interdisciplinary problem. This thesis sums up basic findings about the political participation of women on local level as well as the newest data and examples from the Czech context. Special attention is paid to specific gender barriers faced by local politicians during their public agency. The theory of master suppression techniques by Norwegian social psychologict Berit Ås forms the base of the thesis and is interpreted through Nancy Fraser's and Iris Marion Young's concepts. The theory of master suppression techniques is further examined in the Czech context and confronted with the experience of local female politicians. The particular aim of the thesis is to outline the actual strategies used by local female politicians to cope with gender specific barriers.

40|$|ABSTRACT Navigating {{systems of}} {{leadership}} in Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs) in higher education as a Queer Woman of Color can be a challenging and complex process [...] one that integrates identity, experience, expertise, knowledge, patience, and most importantly the ability to risk; while remaining authentic and professional. It is a balance, which in my own experience and expertise requires constant reflection, evaluation, and adaptation. A negotiation of owning that one has power and agency, while realizing that the many intersecting identities that one holds influences how dominant culture perceives that power and agency. To reach authentic reflection and evaluation in leadership {{it is critical to}} examine and investigate one 2 ̆ 7 s own vocation to lead and to ask, what leads us and sustains us in that leadership? This dissertation will offer a counter-narrative {{of leadership in}} prose-poetry through a lens of intersectionality outside of the hegemonic or dominant ways that define the parameters of leadership. Through the use of personal narratives reinforced by scholarship using the methodology of Scholarly Personal Narrative (SPN), I explore my own experiences of trauma throughout my life that led to agency and inevitably to leadership. I additionally examine the overarching tenants and themes that continue to inform, sustain and strengthen my leadership. 2 ̆ 2 <b>Damned</b> <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> [...] Damned If You Don 2 ̆ 7 t 2 ̆ 2 represents a phrase often used amongst marginalized communities that signifies the challenges of navigating one 2 ̆ 7 s own power and agency within oppressive dominant systems. This SPN dissertation will be supported by the paradigms of Critical Race Theory (CRT) with a specific focus on Counter-Narrative/Storytelling and Critical Race Gendered Epistemology or Feminist Black/Latino Theory, while also incorporating aspects of positive psychology. It will offer a counter-narrative in leadership that highlights how my multiple intersecting identities, coupled with my life experiences, create meaning and go on to further shape my approach to trauma, agency, and leadership. As a Queer woman of color in leadership, I find that by honoring and examining my own stories of trauma and agency, and how it led me to leadership. I am better equipped as a professional to honor the narratives, identities, and experiences of those that I serve...|$|E
5000|$|The protagonist is Major Dan Ridgeway, {{the leader}} of a USMC Rapid Assault Team, or RAT squad. Ridgeway carries a heavy {{personal}} burden from a [...] "damned <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't" [...] decision that won him official acclaim early in his military career. Ridgeway's squad is deployed to a distant planet where workers at a lucrative and strategically critical mining operation have seceded and aligned with an opposing government. The key to reclaiming the facility intact lies in a surgical strike against a deep-underground reactor that powers the ground-based defense systems. Employing an unorthodox means of infiltrating the outer defenses, the RAT squad's powered armor allows them to carve a straight line to the reactor and affix explosives to its hull. Their egress is impeded by stiff resistance and as time runs out, Ridgeway opts for a last-ditch means of survival {{in the face of the}} reactor's imminent detonation.|$|R

5000|$|Known in English as City of God, Cidade de Deus is the eponymous {{name of a}} 1997 semi-autobiographical {{novel by}} Paulo Lins, about three young men and their lives of petty crime during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s in the favela where Lins grew up. An English {{translation}} by Alison Entrekin was published in 2006. The novel was filmed by Fernando Meirelles (director of The Constant Gardener) in 2002 under the same title City of God, {{with most of the}} cast from real-life favelas and in some cases, from Cidade de Deus itself. After filming, the producers set up help groups promising to help those involved to build more promising futures. In 2004 the film received four Academy Award nominations for cinematography, for director Meirelles, for editing and for adapted screenplay by Mantovani. In 2005 TIME chose it as one of the 100 greatest films of all time.

40|$|One {{main and}} {{accelerating}} demographic movement {{the world over}} is from low-density rural communities to high-density urban and suburban concentrations, from outlying archipelagos to central island towns and cities, from smaller islands to larger islands, and from islands to mainlands. Policy-makers laud the benefits of clusters and mega-cities and question the wisdom and sustainability of scattered communities (Courchene, 2005; Porter, 1990). Peripheral locations – particularly remote rural and island communities – are among the hardest hit by these contemporary mobilities, risking outright depopulation. Their communities lobby frantically for some sustained attention by distant policy-makers, and for investment in employment, educational services, health care, or transportation infrastructure {{to stem the tide}} of outward migration. Meanwhile, residents tend to vote with their feet: to the “unemployed, underpaid, or under-appreciated”, going away just makes “a lot of sense” (The Economist, 2005). Meanwhile, and in stark contrast to this scenario, other similarly peripheral locations find themselves attractive to visitors, secondary residents, and mainland retirees, resulting in large spikes in their seasonal (typically summer) populations, strained infrastructure, property price increases, and increasingly gentrified communities (Boissevain & Selwyn, 2004; Clark, Johnson, Lundholm, & Malmberg, 2007; Mu¨ller, 2007).

40|$|While the SAFE-T {{model of}} {{decision}} making emphasizes naturalistic decision making, its potential for cross-comparative analysis of incidents with global implications remains underutilized, which the current paper aims to address. To this end, it draws upon open-source reports from unclassified American, British and Russian intelligence reports to explore the management of three types of 10 high-profile geopolitically sensitive threats from across the globe (verifying potential terrorist identity, hostage rescue and national/international security). Defining features of such incidents include decision makers’ ability to prospectively model competing scenarios in which they must select between options and where every outcome looks aversive and high risk (‘damned <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> or <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don’t decisions’). A frequent consequence of such calculations is ‘decision inertia’ (a failure to execute an important, irrevocable decision resulting in non-optimal consequences), or ‘implementation failure’ (a failure to make a choice). Combining {{the benefit of the}} theoretical framework and hindsight knowledge of the analyzed incidents, the paper facilitates theoretical understanding of decision inertia and failures to act. Encouraging the consideration of multiple scenario endings contingent on a wide spectrum of factors and unique cultural-historical context, it also helps identify past decision errors in order to inform assessment and management of similar geopolitical threats in the future...|$|R
