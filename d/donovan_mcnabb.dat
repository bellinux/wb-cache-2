5|$|Kolb {{was drafted}} by the Philadelphia Eagles {{in the second round}} (36th overall) of the 2007 NFL Draft. He was the third quarterback taken in the draft behind JaMarcus Russell (1st overall) and Brady Quinn (22nd overall). He signed a four-year, $4.285 million {{contract}} with the team on July 25, 2007. Kolb spent 2007 as the third-string quarterback behind <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb</b> and A. J. Feeley.|$|E
5|$|Pittsburgh's first inter-conference {{opponent}} of the season was the Philadelphia Eagles. The Steelers scored on their first drive, with a Jeff Reed field goal. The Eagles offense drove 85yards {{to take the lead}} on a touchdown pass from <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb</b> to Correll Buckhalter. The Eagles defense sacked Ben Roethlisberger eight times throughout the game, two of which resulted in fumbles. Bryant McFadden intercepted his second pass of the season which allowed Reed to add his second field goal of the day—this one from 53-yards. The field goal brought the half time score to 10–6.|$|E
5|$|Vick {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with the Philadelphia Eagles on August 13, 2009. The contract was worth $1.6 million, with no money guaranteed. It contained a team option for the 2010 season worth $5 million. Vick was allowed to participate in all team practices and meetings {{as well as the}} Eagles' last two preseason games. He was eligible to play in the third week of the regular season. Starting quarterback <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb</b> told reporters he gave coach Andy Reid the idea to sign Vick.|$|E
50|$|This {{would be}} <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb's</b> last game as an Eagle.|$|R
50|$|On <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb's</b> {{first play}} back, he {{scrambled}} 13 yards, {{and on the}} very next play, he found wide receiver Jeremy Maclin deep {{in the end zone}} for a 51-yard touchdown.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{retirement}} of Chad Lewis and suspension of Terrell Owens, Smith became one of <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb's</b> top targets; between 2005 and 2006, Smith led the Eagles in receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns. Troy Aikman called Smith [...] "arguably the most underrated player in the NFL." ...|$|R
5|$|Kolb's first NFL start was a 48-22 loss {{against the}} New Orleans Saints {{at home on}} September 20, 2009 due to an injury to <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb.</b> His first career {{touchdown}} was recorded {{in the first quarter}} of that game on a 71-yard pass to DeSean Jackson; he threw for 391yards on 31 completions. On September 27, 2009, Kolb made his second start in place of McNabb, throwing for 327yards and two touchdowns in a 34-14 win against the Kansas City Chiefs. Kolb became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for more than 300yards in each of his first two career starts. He was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week after his efforts against the Chiefs.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell {{was drafted}} by the Eagles with the 25th {{selection}} {{in the first round}} of the 2001 NFL Draft. He began the 2001 season as the fourth wide receiver, but surpassed Na Brown to become the team's slot receiver in week eight. Mitchell became the fourth receiver again after the Eagles signed Antonio Freeman before the 2002 season and caught only twelve passes the entire year. Mitchell became the slot receiver once again during the 2003 season, after Freeman left. In the NFC Divisional Playoff Game against the Green Bay Packers, with the Eagles facing a 4th and 26 situation, he caught a 28-yard pass from <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb</b> to help led the team to a win in overtime. He finished the 2003 season with a career-high 35 catches for 498yards and two touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Giants {{made the}} playoffs for the third {{consecutive}} season. In a September game against the Eagles, they tied the NFL record for most sacks in a game by sacking Philadelphia quarterback <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb</b> 12 times, with Osi Umenyiora recording six of those sacks. They became the third NFL franchise to win 600 games when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 31–10 in October. That same month, they also played in the NFL's first regular season game outside of North America, in London's Wembley Stadium, where they beat Miami 13–10. They ended the regular season 10–6 and defeated Tampa Bay 24–14 {{in the first round of}} the playoffs, earning Manning and Coughlin their first playoff victories with the Giants. The next week, the Giants won their ninth consecutive road game by beating the top-seeded Dallas Cowboys 21–17. In the NFC championship game, Lawrence Tynes kicked an overtime field goal to give them a 23–20 road victory over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
50|$|After a {{scoreless}} third quarter, the Eagles {{would increase}} their {{lead in the}} fourth quarter with quarterback <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabbs</b> 71-yard touchdown pass to running back Brian Westbrook, followed by an Akers 45-yard field goal. Try as they might, the Vikings were unable to build any momentum to mount a rally.|$|R
50|$|Early in {{the first}} quarter, Jacksons 62-yard punt return set up a field goal from Akers. Then after a punt, <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabbs</b> 27-yard {{completion}} to Correll Buckhalter set up a 51-yard field goal by Akers on the last play of the quarter, making it 6-0. But Minnesota took the lead on their next drive with a 40-yard touchdown run from Adrian Peterson.|$|R
50|$|This was <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb's</b> {{first full}} year as {{starting}} quarterback after seeing limited action during his rookie season. With McNabb, the team posted an 11-5 record. For his efforts, McNabb {{was named to the}} Pro Bowl following the season. He would make several more Pro Bowl appearances during his time in Philadelphia. The Eagles played in five NFC Championship games and a Super Bowl (2004) during the McNabb era.|$|R
5|$|In the National Football League (NFL), a tied game {{occurs when}} a regular season game ends with both teams having an equal score. Since the National Hockey League {{eliminated}} ties by adopting the shootout following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the NFL {{is the only one}} of the four major professional sports leagues in North America to have tied games in regular-season play, as Major League Baseball (in the modern era since 1900) and the National Basketball Association have historically played until there is a winner. Unlike soccer (association football), in which teams routinely play for a draw (for the benefit of a point in the standings), NFL teams rarely play for ties. In general, tied games in the NFL are frowned upon by both teams and fans. Because tied games are rare, some players have not known they were allowed in the NFL, such as former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb,</b> who said after a tie game against the Cincinnati Bengals that he did not know a tie was a possible result.|$|E
5|$|Kolb {{attended}} Stephenville High School in Stephenville, Texas, {{where he}} was a three-year starter at quarterback. He moved on to the University of Houston where he earned Conference USA Offensive Most Valuable Player of the Year honors in 2006. Kolb started for two games in place of the injured <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb</b> during the 2009 NFL season for the Eagles, and earned NFC Player of the Week honors following his week 3 performance against the Kansas City Chiefs. Following McNabb's trade to the Washington Redskins in April 2010, Kolb became the starting quarterback for the Eagles. However, after suffering a concussion in week 1 against the Green Bay Packers, Kolb was replaced at quarterback by Michael Vick. Vick suffered a rib cartilage injury in week four and Kolb was named the starter. When Vick returned after week eight, Kolb was relegated to a backup role. Kolb was traded to the Arizona Cardinals {{prior to the start of}} the 2011 season. Kolb was released by the Cardinals on March 15, 2013.|$|E

2500|$|On May 11, 2011, Hopkins {{questioned}} Minnesota Vikings quarterback <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb's</b> racial credentials in a Philadelphia Daily News online article. [...] Marcus Hayes of The Philadelphia Inquirer {{reported that}} according to Hopkins, McNabb had a privileged childhood in suburban Chicago and, as a result, is not black enough or tough enough, at least compared with, say, himself, Michael Vick and Terrell Owens. Hopkins said, [...] "He's got a suntan. That's all... McNabb is {{the guy in the}} house, while everybody else is on the field... He's the one who got the extra coat. The extra servings... He thought he was one of them." ...|$|R
25|$|The hyped quarterback duel between <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb</b> and Michael Vick never materialized, as the Eagles' defense sacked Vick {{three times}} and intercepted him twice, {{including}} Bobby Taylor's 39-yard return for a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|Since retirement, Dungy {{has become}} an {{informal}} mentor to the formerly suspended NFL player Michael Vick, counseling him during his incarceration and, {{with the help of}} <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb,</b> convincing Eagles owner Jeff Lurie and head coach Andy Reid to consider signing him to the team's roster.|$|E
25|$|After Eagles' quarterback <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb</b> {{suffered}} a fractured rib in week one, the Eagles signed Garcia to {{a one-year contract}} on September 14, 2009.

50|$|New York trailed {{greatly in}} the first quarter as Eagles fullback Leonard Weaver got a 41-yard {{touchdown}} run, followed by quarterback <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb's</b> 17-yard touchdown pass to tight end Brent Celek (with a blocked PAT). Philadelphia would add onto their lead in the second quarter with a 30-yard field goal from kicker David Akers. The Giants would get on the board as quarterback Eli Manning found tight end Kevin Boss on an 18-yard touchdown pass, but the Eagles continued their scoring as McNabb completed a 54-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver DeSean Jackson and a 23-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jeremy Maclin.|$|R

5000|$|In June 2008, {{longtime}} fan-favorite {{and newly}} inducted Baseball Hall of Fame sportswriter Bill Conlin drew {{the ire of}} many viewers when he made questionable comments with racial implications after an e-mail regarding a question posed to coach Andy Reid about then Eagles quarterback <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb's</b> shoulder injury was read aloud by host Michael Barkann. The question from Raul was: [...] "Are you serious? It was a stupid question. It's tendinitis. Way to go Philly media. You guys {{do a great job}} over-analyzing everything." [...] Conlin turned to Barkann and said, [...] "surprising that guy would leave the blueberry harvest to send that off." [...] Barkann laughed and then said [...] "don't insult the blueberry harvest, mister." ...|$|R
25|$|Derrick Brooks {{recovered}} and returned a <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb</b> fumble {{for a touchdown}} (his fourth defensive score of the season), but Tampa Bay could not prevail over the Eagles at Veterans Stadium, falling 20–10. It marked the third straight loss at Veterans Stadium for the Buccaneers, and the fourth straight loss overall to the Eagles.|$|E
25|$|Eagles quarterback <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb</b> {{threw for}} 194 {{yards and two}} touchdowns, while also rushing for 54 yards, as Philadelphia {{dominated}} Tampa Bay from start to finish. Bucs quarterback Brad Johnson was intercepted four times, twice by Damon Moore. It was the second consecutive season in which Philadelphia eliminated Tampa Bay from the playoffs during the wild card round, and two days later, Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy was fired.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} quarter, Minnesota took the early lead as Holcomb {{completed}} a 9-yard TD pass to TE Visanthe Shiancoe. The Eagles would respond with kicker David Akers getting a 20-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Vikings trailed as Philadelphia RB Brian Westbrook caught a 6-yard TD pass from QB <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb,</b> along with getting a 1-yard TD run. Minnesota's only response {{for the period}} was kicker Ryan Longwell getting a 39-yard field goal.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} six drives of the game ended in punts, Buccaneers fullback Mike Alstott rushed for 18 yards and caught a pass for eight yards as the team drove 58 yards in eight plays to score on Martín Gramática's 29-yard field goal {{early in the second}} quarter. But late in the quarter, Eagles {{defensive}} lineman Hugh Douglas forced Tampa Bay quarterback Shaun King to fumble, and the ball was recovered by linebacker Mike Mamula at the Buccaneers 15-yard line, setting up Philadelphia quarterback <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb's</b> 5-yard touchdown run. Tampa Bay punted on their next possession and the Eagles marched 69 yards on eight plays to take a 14–3 lead on Na Brown's 5-yard touchdown reception with 12 seconds left in the half.|$|R
2500|$|The Panthers {{then went}} {{on the road again}} to {{eliminate}} the Eagles in the NFC Championship Game, 14–3. Philadelphia was coming off of a 20–17 overtime win over the Green Bay Packers, that included quarterback <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb's</b> 28-yard pass to Freddie Mitchell on a famous play known as [...] "4th and 26". This was the third consecutive NFC Championship Game appearance for Philadelphia, and thus they were heavily favored to win. But Carolina's defense only allowed a field goal and held McNabb to just 10 of 22 completions for 100 yards. Ricky Manning also intercepted McNabb 3 times. Although Carolina's offense only scored 14 points, it was more than enough for the team to earn their first trip to the Super Bowl with a 14–3 win.|$|R

25|$|Syracuse University {{sports are}} by far the most {{attended}} sporting events in the Syracuse area. Basketball games often draw over 30,000 fans, and football games over 40,000. The university has bred dozens of famous professional players since starting an athletics program in the late nineteenth century, including all-time greats Jim Brown, Larry Csonka and Dave Bing, and present professional stars Marvin Harrison, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Freeney, Jason Hart, and <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb.</b> Both teams play in the Carrier Dome.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{scouting}} combine, some scouts questioned {{the strength of}} his throwing arm. McNown, along with Akili Smith, Daunte Culpepper, and <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb,</b> appeared on the cover of ESPN The Magazine in the issue highlighting the draft. He was selected by the Chicago Bears with the twelfth overall pick {{in the first round of}} the 1999 NFL Draft, following a draft pick trade with the Washington Redskins. He was the highest-drafted Bears quarterback since Jim McMahon.|$|E
25|$|On March 15, 2006, after {{consecutive}} frustrating {{seasons with}} the Browns and Lions, Garcia signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles {{to serve as the}} primary backup to <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb</b> in 2006. McNabb had been lost to injury the previous season, and the Eagles went 1-6 without him and missed the playoffs just a year removed from their Super Bowl appearance. Because McNabb was already wearing number 5, Garcia had his jersey number changed to 7, previously worn in Philadelphia by Ron Jaworski.|$|E
50|$|Pasqualoni was an {{assistant}} at Syracuse from 1987 until 1991, when {{he was promoted to}} head coach after the position was vacated by Dick MacPherson, who left for the NFL to coach the New England Patriots. The Orange (then known as the Orangemen) enjoyed a number of successful years with Pasqualoni at the helm. The team won the Fiesta Bowl over Colorado in 1992 and defeated Clemson 41-0 in Gator Bowl in 1995, <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb's</b> freshman year. The team had a 6-3 record in bowl games under Pasqualoni. Pasqualoni's 14-year record with Syracuse was 107-59-1. His only losing season was in 2002 with a 4-8 record. Most seasons of his tenure saw Syracuse competing in the Top 25 in the country.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} quarter, Detroit trailed early as Eagles RB Brian Westbrook ran 25 {{yards for a}} TD. The Lions tied the game on a Kevin Jones 2-yard TD run, but Philadelphia regained the lead with a Westbrook 5 yard TD run, along with QB <b>Donovan</b> <b>McNabb's</b> 68-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Curtis. In the second quarter, the points bonanza {{continued}} as McNabb and Curtis hooked up with each other again on a 12-yard TD pass and a 43-yard TD pass to increase the Eagles' lead. Detroit responded with QB Jon Kitna completing TD passes of 11 yards to WR Shaun McDonald and 91 yards to WR Roy Williams.
