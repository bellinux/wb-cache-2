500|$|In March 2016, Sana Amanat {{introduced}} President Barack Obama at {{a reception}} for Women's History Month in the White House. In his opening remarks Obama replied, [...] "Ms. Marvel {{may be your}} comic book creation, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> lot of young boys and girls, Sana's a real superhero." ...|$|E
2500|$|Laura Ricketts is {{a former}} {{corporate}} lawyer. She lives with her partner on the North Side of Chicago. Ricketts received her Bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1994, and her Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 1998. Laura talks of her own struggle to come out; [...] "I came out to my family I would say early to mid 90s. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time I wasn't really out to myself, growing up in Omaha, Neb., to a Catholic conservative family. It {{took me a while}} to come out to myself and not long after that I came out to them. I think that it really couldn't have been a better experience. They were all immediately supportive. ... I have been really really fortunate in that regard." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "American {{money in}} the shape of dollar bills; but they have all been sent by Irish people. The United States is a large place, and there is room there, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> honest man." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{instant she}} had been frightened at her own words. She was now quite angry and short of breath. She had {{contrived}} a rapid indignation against Mary and myself.|$|R

6000|$|... "Thank you, dear Joseph," [...] said Amelia, {{quite ready}} to kiss her brother, if he were so minded. (And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> kiss from such a dear {{creature}} as Amelia, I would purchase all Mr. Lee's conservatories out of hand.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Her ladyship is {{unconscious}} now," [...] he announced. [...] "Perhaps {{that is a}} good sign. I {{never liked}} that unnatural calm. She'll be unconscious, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> great many hours. For God's sake, come and get a whisky and soda and give me one!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pretty well, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> beginner,' remarked Mr. Bolter complacently. 'The pots I {{took off}} airy railings, and the milk-can was {{standing}} by itself outside a public-house. I thought it might get rusty with the rain, or catch cold, yer know. Eh? Ha! ha! ha!' ...|$|E
500|$|Avnet and Conran {{spent two}} years working on the screenplay, which {{included}} numerous genre-related references and homages, and developing a working relationship. Then, the producer took the script and the trailer and began approaching actors. In order to protect Conran's vision, Avnet decided to shoot the movie independently {{with a lot of}} his own money. The producer realized that [...] "the very thing that made this film potentially so exciting <b>for</b> me, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> audience, which was the personal nature of it and the singularity of the vision, would never succeed and never survive the development process within a studio." ...|$|R
6000|$|In the {{presence}} of such <b>a</b> tremendous possibility <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant <b>I</b> felt anxious only about myself. What I should do; how dispose of the body; how explain the circumstance of his taking off; how evade the ubiquitous reporter and the coroner's inquest; how a suspicion might arise that I had in some way, through negligence or for some dark purpose, unknown to the jury, precipitated the catastrophe, all flashed before me. Even the note, with its darkly suggestive offer of [...] "good material" [...] for me, looked diabolically significant. What might not an intelligent lawyer make of it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I've {{felt any}} surprise, deacon, {{it is that}} a man of your taste and {{judgment}} should have held aloof so long from the only employment that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> fit <b>for</b> <b>a</b> man of real energy and character." ...|$|R
60|$|It is impossible, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{drawing to}} be made on this method unless the artist had a clear image in his mind's eye of what he was about to draw, and was able, in some degree, to project it on the paper or slate.|$|E
6000|$|... "You have become" [...] he continued, leaning {{his head}} upon his bony fingers, [...] "a man of letters, I believe. I congratulate you. You have {{stepped into the}} {{whirlpool}} from which no man can retrace his steps. Yet even this is better, is it not, than the Methodism? You were not cut out, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> parson." ...|$|E
60|$|My 'Trepida' {{will do well}} enough, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Latin {{rendering}} of Grebe, and will include the whole group of them,--'stagnarum' remaining for this species only, and the others being called Tippeted Trepids, or Muffed Trepids, Eared Trepids or Majestic Trepids, as I {{find out what they}} wear, and how they behave. Gr√®be is used by Buffon only for the larger ones, and Castagneux for the smaller, which is absurd enough, unless the smaller are also the browner.|$|E
60|$|I {{must confess}} {{that after this}} my nerve, which is {{generally}} pretty good, gave out {{to such an extent}} that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> fainted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few minutes. During that faint I seemed to be carrying on a conversation with Mavovo, though whether it ever took place or I only imagined it I am not sure, since I always forgot to ask him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed it is," [...] {{agreed the}} Scarecrow. [...] "It may prove our best {{means of escape}} from our difficulties. I believe <b>I</b> will <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few minutes; so I will thank you, friend Tip, to get out your knife and rip this heavy crown from my forehead." ...|$|R
60|$|Jack. Well, really, Gwendolen, I {{must say}} that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{there are lots of}} other much nicer names. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Jack, <b>for</b> instance, <b>a</b> charming name.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then he is baser {{than even}} I conceived. Mr. Grey, I {{am a man}} spare of my speech to those with whom I am unacquainted, and the world tails me a soured, {{malicious}} man. And yet, when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment that one so young as you are, endowed as I must suppose with no ordinary talents, and actuated as I will believe with a pure and honourable spirit, should be the dupe, or tool, or even present friend of such a creature as this perjured Peer, it gives me pang." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{rose to the}} surface," [...] he said, slowly [...] "and saw {{the ship}} drawing away in the {{darkness}} and heard the cries on board, I swam as strongly as I could towards it. I was weighed down by my clothes, and I had also struck my head going overboard, and I felt that every moment was my last, when I suddenly bumped up against the life-belt. I had just strength to put that on and give one faint hail, and then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time I lost my senses." ...|$|E
60|$|I feel {{exceedingly}} surreptitious {{in coming}} down here without an announcement of any kind. I {{do not want}} to see any advertisements around, for the reason that I'm not a lecturer any longer. I reformed long ago, and I break over and commit this sin only just one time this year: and that is moderate, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> person of my disposition. It is not my purpose to lecture any more as long as I live. I never intend to stand up on a platform any more--unless by the request of a sheriff or something like that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{will do what}} I can," [...] Anna promised. [...] "I {{believe that}} you are quite safe. He has had brain fever since, and, as you say, I am more like what you were then than you {{yourself}} are now. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment that he would recognize you." ...|$|R
5000|$|After the New Life Church shooting, Assam later {{stated that}} [...] "God guided me and {{protected}} me <b>I</b> did not <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute to run away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They are? <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> now, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{professional}} man, {{you know}} but {{little of the}} terms of your art," [...] observed Borroughcliffe, with an affectation of irony; [...] "I never have seen a youth of your years who knew less. What names, now, would you affix to this, and this, and this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|It is eleven, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> clock struck. O Lord, {{there has}} been a deal of time through our hands since I went down to supper! All this has come from my own folly; I somehow could not think the gulf so impassable, and I read him some notes on the Duke of Argyll[8]--I thought he would agree so far, and that we might have some {{rational}} discussion on the rest. And now--after some hours--he has told me that he is a weak man, and that I am driving him too far, and that I know not what I am doing. O dear God, this is bad work! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment of}} the {{documents}} in my pocket, my passport chequered with visas and addressed in my commendation and {{in the name of}} her late Majesty by We, Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoigne Cecil, Marquess of Salisbury, Earl of Salisbury, Viscount Cranborne, Baron Cecil, and so forth, to all whom it may concern, my Carte d'Identite (useful on minor occasions) of the Touring Club de France, my green ticket to the Reading Room of the British Museum, and my Lettre d'Indication from the London and County Bank. A foolish humour prompts me to unfold all these, hand them to her and take the consequences, but I resist.|$|E
60|$|From the 19th January to the 2d February {{inclusive}} {{is exactly}} fifteen days, during which time, with {{the intervention of}} some days' idleness, to let imagination brood on the task a little, I have written a volume. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bet, I {{could have done it}} in ten days. Then I must have had no Court of Session to take me up two or three hours every morning, and dissipate my attention and powers of working {{for the rest of the}} day. A volume, at cheapest, is worth ¬£1000. This is working at the rate of ¬£24,000 a year; but then we must not bake buns faster than people have appetite to eat them. They are not essential to the market, like potatoes.|$|E
40|$|The postcolonial {{condition}} (or what I shall {{refer to}} as "postcoloniality", as distinct from "postcolonialism" which is better reserved, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> intellectual movement {{with a number of}} distinguishing traits ultimately traceable to certain specific historical conditions) is but another name for the politics of translation as it plays out today (RAJAGOPALAN 2002 a). It lays bare the multiplicity of vested interests that have underpinned the history of translation through the ages. Furthermore, it forces us to rethink some of the time-honoured conceptual distinctions such intra-lingual vs. inter-lingual translation by problematising the very notion of "a language" (i. e. language in its individuating sense, as opposed to the generic or abstract senses). The main objective {{of this paper is to}} address the phenomenon of increasing hybridisation of the world's languages and its implications for the way we theorise about translation...|$|R
6000|$|... "Saul of my body, man," [...] {{said the}} king, [...] "it {{is a curious}} piece, and, as <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> fit <b>for</b> <b>a</b> king's chalmer; and the subject, as you say, Master George, vera {{adequate}} and beseeming--being, as I see, the judgment of Solomon--a prince in whose paths it weel becomes a' leeving monarchs to walk with emulation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do for me? Hang me," [...] said Mr. Hayes, flourishing a stick, and {{perfectly}} pot-valiant, [...] "do you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> care <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bastard and a--?" ...|$|R
60|$|What {{were the}} woes of {{humanity}} to the heathen? If a man {{fell in the}} race of life, so much the worse for him. So much the better for them, for {{there was one more}} competitor out of the way. One of the greatest Roman poets, indeed, talks of the pleasure which men have in seeing others in trouble, just as, when the storm is tossing up the sea, it is sweet to sit on the shore, and watch the ships labouring in the waves. Not, he says, that one takes actual pleasure in seeing a man in trouble, but in the thought that one is not in the trouble oneself. A rather lame excuse, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> rather inhuman sentiment.|$|E
60|$|The clergy acted this disgraceful {{part because}} they hoped to get the nonconformists, or dissenters, {{thoroughly}} put down in this reign, and to have but one prayer-book and one service {{for all kinds of}} people, no matter what their private opinions were. This was pretty well, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Protestant Church, which had displaced the Romish Church because people had a right to their own opinions in religious matters. However, they carried it with a high hand, and a prayer-book was agreed upon, in which the extremest opinions of Archbishop Laud were not forgotten. An Act was passed, too, preventing any dissenter from holding any office under any corporation. So, the regular clergy in their triumph were soon as merry as the King. The army being by this time disbanded, and the King crowned, everything was to go on easily for evermore.|$|E
6000|$|... "I!--I glad of {{anything}} of the sort! No, indeed, my child; I should be sorry enough did <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, you would not marry as soon as is prudent, now {{that the war is}} over. As for the children, I dote on them; and I have ever thought it a misfortune that the Littlepages have had so few, especially sons. Your grandfather, my general, was an only son; your father was an only son; and you are an only son; that is, so far as coming to men's estates are, or were concerned. No, Mordaunt, my child, it is the warmest wish of my heart to see you properly married, and to hold the Littlepages of the next generation in my arms. Two of you I have had there already, and I shall have lived the life of the blessed to be able to hold the third." ...|$|E
