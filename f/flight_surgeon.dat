In addition, he was the Air Force Surgeon during operations Allied Force and Shining Hope in the Balkans. He served as the Command Surgeon for Air Combat Command where he molded the Air Force medical support for the response to the attacks of September 11, 2001, and for Operation Noble Eagle and Operation Enduring Freedom.

The crew warded off boredom by reading, playing cards, sleeping in bunks mounted over the fuel tanks, and writing letters. After the existing endurance record was surpassed on Thursday evening, January 3, the support crew sent up cheese, figs, olives and five jars of caviar for an in-flight celebration.|$|E

25|$|With an {{appreciation}} that {{both men were}} {{to blame for the}} altercation, Banner gives Bond the assignment he craves: the rocket-powered X-2, which is designed to fly to the edge of outer space. The general insists, however, on piloting the first test flight at full power, despite strong pressure from his superior, Lieutenant General Bryan Shelby (Paul Fix), to let a younger man take on the dangerous job. When Bond is assigned to fly the last half-power test before the main flight, he goes to full power without authorization and barely survives a high-altitude bailout when the aircraft goes out of control. The base <b>flight</b> <b>surgeon</b> tells Banner that only a young, fit person could have survived, leading the general to accept a promotion and transfer. He recommends Colonel McKee as his successor. Although Banner offers to take Connie with him to his new assignment, she decides to stay with Bond.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} intent {{was for the}} military and the Surgeon General to understand what was causing the high flight mishap rate. Shortly after the appointment of the first <b>flight</b> <b>surgeons,</b> research and experience led to a dramatic improvement in aircrew health as well as a significant raising of the entry medical standards for all aircrew. The early <b>flight</b> <b>surgeons</b> found that the Army's practice of assigning officers to flight duty who were not physically qualified for infantry or cavalry duty was improper. Because of the G-forces, risk of spatial disorientation, and risk of hypoxia encountered in the aviation environment, among other challenges, early <b>flight</b> <b>surgeons</b> found that aviation personnel must be scrupulously healthy and well trained in the basics of aerospace physiology.|$|R
