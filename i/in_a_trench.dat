5|$|Blackadder Goes Forth is {{the fourth}} and final series of the BBC sitcom Blackadder, written by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, which aired from 28 September to 2 November 1989 on BBC One. The series placed the {{recurring}} characters of Blackadder, Baldrick and George <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> in Flanders during World War I, and followed their various doomed attempts {{to escape from the}} trenches to avoid certain death under the misguided command of General Melchett. The series is particularly noted for its criticism of the British Army leadership during the campaign, and also refers to a number of famous figures of the age. In addition, the series is remembered for the poignant ending of the final episode.|$|E
5|$|Bleak then {{returned}} to the patrol and attempted to treat more wounded members, but soon thereafter a Chinese hand grenade bounced off the helmet of the soldier standing next to him and landed nearby. Bleak tackled the soldier over and covered him with his larger frame to protect him from the grenade, but neither was injured in the ensuing blast. The patrol then continued on its mission, and was successful in capturing several Chinese prisoners. However, as it descended Hill 499 to return to UN lines, they were ambushed by another group of Chinese hidden <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> with an automatic weapon. Three of the other soldiers were wounded in the attack, and as Bleak attempted to run to them, he was hit in the leg. Bleak dressed all four wounds, but one of the men had been hit too critically to move. In spite of continued Chinese fire and his own injury, Bleak picked up the wounded soldier and began to carry him down the hill.|$|E

5|$|The grenade did possess several {{problems}} with its design. Users were urged to actually {{run up to}} the tank and place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then {{be placed in the}} unenviable situation of attempting to pry the grenade loose whilst still holding onto the lever. It was also discovered that as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable, which made it even more difficult to use. As the grenade was a short-range weapon, users were trained to hide <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> or other place of concealment until the tank went past them, and then to stick the grenade {{to the rear of the}} tank, where its armour was thinnest. Users were relatively safe from a few yards away, as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated. The Mark II design used a plastic casing instead of glass, and a detonator instead of a cap.|$|E
5|$|The 48th Battalion {{returned}} to its former positions on the railway embankment {{on the night of}} 3 April, in their absence the line had been subjected to two more German attacks which had been beaten off fairly easily. On this occasion, despite his usual reticence to congest his forward positions with troops, Leane asked for permission to use two companies forward on the railway embankment, and another forward in a series of posts on the extreme left of the battalion sector. These posts were on either side of a gully just south of the Albert–Amiens road. He held his fourth company <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> called Pioneer Trench, that had been dug on the high ground overlooking the embankment. He was also given a company of the 46th Battalion which he held in reserve near his headquarters. On 4 April, the commander of the 4th Division, Major General Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan decided the main line of defence would be the railway embankment, rather than the high ground behind it. While this did not change the dispositions of the 48th Battalion, it caused Gellibrand to issue an order that the embankment must be held at all costs, which had significant consequences for the coming battle. On the same day, word was received that a German attack was to be expected the next morning.|$|E

25|$|On November 17, after a {{few days}} of heavy {{artillery}} and mortar fire exchanges between the rebels and the military, the rebels took control of Rwindi, the headquarters of Virunga National Park. Soldiers were reported to be in full retreat and disarray while the rebels marched into the town and continued further north toward Kanyabayonga in a single-file organised column. During the bombardments, prior to the fall of the town, an Indian peacekeeper was wounded in the head by shrapnel while taking shelter <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench.</b>|$|E
25|$|Small parties {{from the}} Guards Division {{advanced}} on Lesbœufs and eventually took cover <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> for several hours, before falling back during a German counter-attack. For several hours the village had been unoccupied but no British reserves were left, {{after the great}} number of casualties inflicted on the 56th, 6th and Guards divisions earlier in the day, many caused by a decision to leave tank lanes in the British barrage, which left several German machine-gun nests undamaged. Few lanes were used by the tanks, most of which broke down early or were knocked out. The Guards Division eventually dug in short of the final objective, west of the Gird Trenches in front of Lesbœufs.|$|E

25|$|The executions {{were carried}} out at the Floriana Parade Ground in the {{presence}} of the rest of the Froberg Regiment, which was now imprisoned. The first fifteen mutineers were divided into three groups of five: each group was hanged by the following group. The last group was not hanged, but instead executed by firing squad with the remaining prisoners. Some did not die immediately and tried to escape, and although most were recaptured and executed, two ran away and died after jumping off the bastions. Meanwhile, the mutineers' leader Caro Mitro together with his friend Nicola d'Anastasi had managed to escape, but they were captured on 25 or 26 April by Maltese soldiers near Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq. They were hanged on the same day and were buried <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> beneath the Bastioni della Salnitriera.|$|E
25|$|On 29 August {{a battle}} took place, {{that is usually}} named the Battle of Schoterzijl. Of course, in 1396 Schoterzijl did not exist yet, {{but it is clear}} this battle took place somewhere between the stronghold of Kuinre and the village of Oosterzee. The Frisians were drawn up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> they had dug, behind an earthen wall. The Hollanders stormed the wall and a group of Hainautian nobles, among them John of Werchin, the seneschal of Hainaut, and John, Lord of Ligne and Barbençon, managed to get into the trench and break through the Frisian line, then attack it from the rear. At this, the Frisians broke and fled; numbers of {{casualties}} on their side range from 3,000 to 400. Most chronicles name Juw Juwinga ("Yves Joncre") as among the Frisian dead.|$|E
25|$|Workers plan to pump {{water into}} turbine condensers, but need to pump {{water out of}} them first. Work to {{transfer}} water from the unit 2 and unit 1 condensers to a central storage tank was completed on 9 and 10 April. Workers have also knocked holes through the turbine hall buildings of units 2 and 4 to accommodate hoses for the water transfer. At unit 3, work continues to make space for water in the turbine condenser by pumping existing water into other tanks. Japanese news wire NHK reports that workers are laying hoses to transfer water to an LLW waste processing facility, which continues to be inspected. TEPCO says that it cannot start work switching on emergency systems on site until the turbine hall is dry. NHK also reported that radioactive water filling a tunnel near unit 2 has risen 12cm since a leak <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> was stopped on Wednesday 6 April.|$|E

The fire, which would eventually burn 1,548 acre, was ultimately controlled on May 17.

25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1944 Ahmedov fought in Operation Bagration. On 23 June, his platoon and three others {{reportedly}} ambushed and destroyed a column of German infantry. On 24 June during the storming of German fortifications near Parichi village, Ahmedov reportedly killed more than ten German soldiers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench.</b> He was wounded but continued to lead the platoon. On 25 June, his platoon crossed the Tremlia ahead of the main forces. The platoon reportedly supported the crossing with its fire for ten hours. Ahmadov was wounded a second time and reportedly refused to leave the battlefield. On 26 June during {{the attack on the}} village of Malyn Ahmadov was wounded in the thigh. He reportedly was carried from the battlefield when he lost consciousness from blood loss. He was awarded the Order of Alexander Nevsky on 27 July. On 2 September, Ahmadov died of his wounds at Stare in Gmina Nieporęt.|$|E
25|$|The Brooklyn, Flatbush, and Coney Island Railway, or Brighton Line, was {{incorporated}} in 1877 {{in order to}} connect Downtown Brooklyn with the hotels and resorts at Coney Island, Manhattan Beach, and Brighton Beach. The line opened on June 2, 1878, originally running from the entrance of Prospect Park to the Brighton Beach Hotel. However, the railroad desired to get the line closer to downtown Brooklyn. There was a problem–the line could not pass through Prospect Park as this was before subway started {{to be built in}} New York, and therefore the line was to be built <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> through the hill at Crown Heights, connecting with the Long Island Rail Road tracks at Atlantic Avenue. The route, was built on the surface between Atlantic Avenue (Bedford Terminal) and Park Place. The line was then built in an open cut {{to the rest of the}} line at Prospect Park in order to avoid grade crossings and anger from the local community. This portion of the Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railway's mainline would become the Franklin Avenue Line. Later on, in order to accommodate larger locomotives for LIRR through service, the open cut had to be dug deeper.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{residents}} lived in circular or rectangular houses which they built between {{the river and the}} eastern secondary wall. The placement of the structures suggests that the layout was planned. The dwellings were built around a central ceremonial plaza likely used for rituals and public gatherings, as has been found at other similar locations. Posts for the house frames were placed either in individual holes, or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> dug slightly narrower than the posts. Walls were completed with wattle and daub, a plaster mixture of grass and clay, and the roof covered with bark or thatch. The doorway usually faced south to keep out the winter's north winds. Inside, a single family slept on pole-frame beds, covered with tamarack boughs, deer skins, and furs. Sometimes a fire was kept {{in the middle of the}} house and a hole in the roof let out the smoke. Pits dug in the earthen floor of the house held stored foods such as corn, nuts, and seeds in woven bags. Perishable foods like meat were probably stored outside prior to cooking. Pits outside were also used for garbage and community resources.|$|E

500|$|The International Union of Operating Engineers (called Operators for short) {{represented}} {{the men and}} women who sat at the controls of the heavy equipment used on the construction of the pipeline. This equipment included bulldozers, cranes, drilling rigs, and sidebooms—a cross between a bulldozer and a crane that could lay a section of pipe <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> parallel to its tracks. Because most of the heavy equipment was unheated, six operators were typically assigned to each piece of equipment, allowing for frequent breaks. A popular joke on the pipeline was that the sole qualification to be an Operator was, [...] "Must be able to sit on a sideboom at 40 below and not freeze up." [...] More seriously, one laborer wrote, was that there was nothing more terrifying than to be <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> and have a drunken or unskilled Operator handling the pipe that was being laid in the trench.|$|E
