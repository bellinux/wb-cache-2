40|$|The Netherlands {{contains}} more than 400 hydraulic structures, of which 120 are locks. Inspections carried out since 2010 by Rijkswaterstaat revealed {{that a number of}} cracks per <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> have been found. Based on experience and an evaluation of the photos made during the inspections it is assumed that the cracks occur due to fatigue. At this moment there is no good insight in the fatigue calculation of steel <b>lock</b> <b>gates.</b> The standard EUROCODE 3 used at the moment, has a part dedicated to fatigue strength, but describes that it is only applicable to structures in atmospheric conditions. As <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> function in (sea) water conditions, it is questionable whether this standard can be used. Another aspect {{is that there is no}} guideline how to determine a load spectrum of forces on <b>lock</b> <b>gates.</b> The following topics are covered: a description of the forces on <b>lock</b> <b>gates,</b> a summation of the observations where cracks have been found, which part of the <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> should be investigated and the standard that should be used and it’s limitations. Two calculations of fatigue damage based on a simplified model of the forces on <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> are made. The first investigated case is the West lock of Sambeek and the second is the East lock of Terneuzen. For these <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> the waterlevel spectrum is determined based on the waterlevel measurements of Rijkswaterstaat. From this spectrum a fatigue damage calculation is made. The results of the fatigue damage calculation based on the simplified schematisation of forces on <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> did not match the fatigue cracks that have been found during the investigations. Some aspects causing this disparity might be that the schematisation of the <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> is too simplified and the influence of waves is neglected. Another aspect that could influence the fatigue damage is the maintenance. A poor state of the wooden sealing at the back post, the coating layer and/or the cathodic protection system, could result in lower fatigue damage values. All these aspects have a negative influence on the S-N curve. The fatigue damage calculated with a simplified model cannot determine correct fatigue damage values. Therefore a FEM-model should be used to determine the stresses in the <b>lock</b> <b>gate.</b> The stresses in the <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> itself should be monitored. A <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> could be fitted with strain gauges to determine the real stresses in the <b>lock</b> <b>gate.</b> These real stresses could be compared with the result of the FEM-model and confirm the reliability of the FEM-model. Research on the influence of the salt and fresh water condition with or without cathodic protection should be done and rules included in the EUROCODE 3 on the influence of salt and fresh water.

40|$|<b>Lock</b> <b>gates</b> are an {{important}} part of the transportation infrastructure within the United States (US), having many economic, safety, and environmental benefits over rail and highway transportation systems. Unfortunately, many existing <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> throughout the US have reached or exceeded their initial design life and require frequent repairs to remain in service. Unscheduled repairs often increase as gates age, having a local economic impact on freight transport which can create economic ripples throughout the nation. Fatigue and corrosion are key causes of unscheduled service interruptions, degrading <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> components over time. Additionally, because <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> are submerged during operation, crack detection prior to component failure can be difficult, and repair costs can be high. This thesis presents an analytical and experimental investigation into fatigue damage within common <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> geometries, and develops fatigue mitigation strategies capable of extending gate service-life. The goal of the research program is to identify critical fatigue regions and locally extend gate component fatigue life. Detailed finite element analyses are combined with fatigue and fracture mechanics theories to predict critical fatigue regions within common gate details and develop retrofit strategies for mitigating fatigue cracking. Full-scale experimental fatigue testing of a critical <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> component is conducted to provide a baseline for evaluation of retrofit strategies. Retrofit strategies using carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates having optimized pre-stress levels are discussed...|$|R

The design and optimization process of the gate was realized with the LBR 5 <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> optimization software considering the cost and weight aspects of the structure. This method led to an optimized solution of the <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> on which further studies were concentrated. After a brief overview of the state of art of ship impact analysis on <b>lock</b> <b>gates,</b> it was decided to perform a quasi-static analysis by finite elements. The non linear finite elements software FINELG was used to conduct a non linear numerical analysis of the effect of a boat impact on the gate. Several analyses were performed that highlighted the influence of the stiffener dimensions and the influence of the impact zone on the gate structural behavior submitted to impact. Finally, two different behaviors have been distinguished, a ductile one and a fragile one. The results showed the importance of the development of a global plastic mechanism, thanks to a ductile behavior, with the purpose of dissipating a large amount of energy. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Functioning <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> are essential for this mode of transportation because they control water levels and provide access through dams for ships. Fatigue cracking is caused by cyclic loading and corrosion. Cyclic loading on a <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> was imitated using a finite element model. This model was used to calculate stress ranges for a cycle so {{that the number of}} cycles to failure could be calculated. The proportion of cycles to cycles to failure is known as the fatigue capacity. A linear fatigue damage accumulation rule (Miner’s Rule) helped determine the fatigue critical regions within the gate. Twenty-seven sections of high stress were identified and analyzed. A section {{at the base of the}} <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> sustained the most damage and was determined to be the most fatigue susceptible location. Further analysis and experimentation will validate these results so that retrofits become a possibility in preventing damage due to fatigue caused by cyclic loading...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Constrained by the {{physical}} environments, the long-thin topology has recently been promoted for many practical deployments of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In general, a long-thin topology is composed {{of a number of}} long branches of sensor nodes, where along a branch each sensor node has only one potential parent node toward the sink node. Although data aggregation may alleviate excessive packet contention, the maximum payload size of a packet and the dynamically changing traffic loads may severely affect the amount of sensor readings that may be collected along a long branch of sensor nodes. In addition, many practical applications of long-thin WSNs demand the exact sensor readings at each location along the deployment areas for monitoring and analysis purposes, so sensor readings may not be aggregated when they are collected. This paper proposes a lightweight, self-adaptive scheme that designates multiple collection nodes, termed <b>lock</b> <b>gates,</b> along a long-thin network to collect sensor readings sent from their respective upstream sensor nodes. The self-adaptive <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> designation scheme balances between the responsiveness and the congestion of data collection while mitigating the funneling effect. The scheme also dynamically adapts the designation of <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> to accommodate the time-varying sensor reading generation rates of different sensor nodes. A testbed of 100 Jennic sensor nodes is developed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> designation scheme.

Finally, several ship impact analyses are conducted on the reinforced gate and they highlight the influence of the stiffener dimensions and the impact zone on the structural behavior of the gate. The results of the numerical analyses underline the importance of the development of a global plastic mechanism with the purpose of dissipating a large amount of energy...|$|R
