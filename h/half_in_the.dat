5|$|At {{its final}} {{landfall}} in Guangdong, Imbudo produced strong winds, with a peak gust of 200km/h (124mph) measured at Shangchuan Island. At Yangjiang, gusts reached 159km/h (99mph), causing eleven boats to sink. There, over 10,000trees fell {{due to the}} strong winds, more than <b>half</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city, and 7,649homes were damaged or destroyed. In Zhanjiang, the storm damaged power lines and water pumps, leaving residents without access to water. Imbudo spawned tornadoes in Luoding and Zhanjiang, damaging dozens of houses and killing 6,000chickens. Throughout Guangdong, Imbudo destroyed 595,000houses and caused ¥1.9billion (CNY, $230million USD). There were at least eight deaths in the province.|$|E
5|$|Banded sea kraits are semiaquatic. Juveniles stay {{in water}} and on {{adjacent}} coast, but adults are able to move further inland and spend half their time on land and <b>half</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ocean. Adult males are more terrestrially active during mating and hunt in shallower water, requiring more terrestrial locomotive ability. On the other hand, adult females are less active on land during mating and hunt in deeper water, requiring more aquatic locomotive ability. Because males are smaller, they crawl and swim faster than females.|$|E

After the match, Diarra apologized again for the incident. He was supported by his former coach Laurent Blanc who stated that Diarra made a simple mistake that he immediately regretted as soon as he realized what he did. Diarra was initially suspended for three matches, however, following a November tribunal by the Ligue de Football Professionnel, his suspension was upgraded to six matches.
