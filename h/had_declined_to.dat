5|$|The farm invasions {{severely}} impacted agricultural development. Zimbabwe {{had produced}} over two {{million tons of}} maize in 2000; by 2008 this <b>had</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> approximately 450,000. By October 2003, Human Rights Watch reported {{that half of the}} country's population were food insecure, lacking enough food to meet basic needs. By 2009, 75% of Zimbabwe's population were relying on food aid, the highest proportion of any country at that time. Zimbabwe faced continuing economic decline. In 2000, the country's GDP was US $7.4 billion; by 2005 this <b>had</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> US $3.4 billion. Inflation resulted in economic crisis. By 2007, Zimbabwe had the highest inflation rate in the world, at 7600%. By 2008, inflation exceeded 100,000% and a loaf of bread cost a third of the average daily wage. Increasing numbers of Zimbabweans relied on remittances from relatives abroad.|$|E
5|$|After the Four Freedoms series ran in The Saturday Evening Post, the {{magazine}} made sets of reproductions {{available to the}} public and received 25,000 orders. Additionally the OWI, which six months earlier <b>had</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> employ Rockwell to promote the Four Freedoms, requested 2.5 million sets of posters featuring the Four Freedoms for its war-bond drive in early 1943.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its dis-incorporation, the {{population}} of East Redmond <b>had</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> 185. An unofficial population count by the Washington Secretary of State in 1956 estimated that the town had 516 residents, but after the 1957 dis-incorporation vote, the town's population was reduced to 225 by 1958. The town was the smallest incorporated place in King County for most of its existence.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, {{while still}} married to Marianne, Gingrich began {{an affair with}} House of Representatives staffer Callista Bisek, {{more than two decades}} his junior. Gingrich and his second wife were {{divorced}} in 2000. The marriage produced no children. On January 19, 2012, Marianne Ginther Gingrich alleged in an interview on ABC's Nightline that she <b>had</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> accept Gingrich's suggestion of an open marriage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century the {{population}} of Gigha peaked at over 600, but <b>had</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> just under 400 by {{the close of the}} 19th century. After half of millennium of association, the MacNeills sold the isle for £49,000 to James Williams Scarlett, a nephew of James Scarlett, 1st Baron Abinger in 1865. His son, Lieutenant-Colonel William James Scarlett built the mansion house of Achamore and Gigha remained in the family's hands until 1919.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} and summer of 1944, the SDS <b>had</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> a {{strength}} of around 24,000–25,000 men. With the return of the Partisans to Serbia proper, the SDS began to incur serious casualties. For example, between 15 March and 15 August 1944, the SDS lost 157 men killed, 107 wounded and 26 missing. By August 1944, SDS units were responding to Mihailović's call for a general mobilisation by defecting openly to his Chetniks.|$|E

5|$|Route X53 took a {{different}} route between Burnley and Rawtenstall, via Water and Waterfoot in the upper Irwell Valley. In the early 1960s these journeys were 4-hourly and started/ended at Burnley. By the 1970s frequency <b>had</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> a southbound morning and northbound evening peak working, but it survived to be renumbered 753 when X43 became 743. It was withdrawn along with the 743.|$|E
5|$|Social {{tensions}} were {{exacerbated by}} {{the revival of the}} Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, $1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan <b>had</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> negligible influence within the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} the station's output {{continued}} to fall, coupled with increased operating costs, such as flue gas cleaning, led to Battersea's demise. On 17 March 1975, the A Station was closed after being in operation for 40 years. By this time the A Station was co-firing oil and its generating capacity <b>had</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> 228MW.|$|E

5|$|With {{increasing}} industrialisation, London's {{population grew}} rapidly throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, {{and it was}} for {{some time in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries the most populous city in the world. Its population peaked at 8,615,245 in 1939 immediately before the outbreak of the Second World War, but <b>had</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> 7,192,091 at the 2001 Census. However, the population then grew by just over a million between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, to reach 8,173,941 in the latter enumeration.|$|E
5|$|By 1988, Searchlight {{reported}} that the party's membership <b>had</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> around 1,000. Tyndall responded by trying to raise finances, calling for greater sales of their newspaper and increasing the price of membership by 50%. He also promised {{that he would make}} the BNP the largest extreme-right group in the UK and that he would establish a professional headquarters for the party. This was achieved in 1989, as a party headquarters was opened in Welling, Southeast London, an area chosen because it was a recipient of significant 'white flight' from inner London. That year also witnessed the BNP become the most prominent force on the British far-right as the NF collapsed amid internal arguments and schisms.|$|E
5|$|Following Houston's loss to Utah, McGrady {{underwent}} {{arthroscopic surgery}} on both {{his left shoulder}} and left knee. Early in the 2008–09 season, he missed 18 games, including a two-week stretch in January as his knee was not fully healed from his offseason surgery. On February 24, he had microfracture surgery in Chicago, forcing him to miss {{the remainder of the}} year. By then, his averages <b>had</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> 15.6 points and 4.4 rebounds per game. In a surprise turn of events, the Rockets qualified for the playoffs without McGrady and advanced to the second round, pushing the eventual-champion Los Angeles Lakers to seven games.|$|E

5|$|Fox {{alleged that}} it {{contacted}} Warner Bros. before production began in 2005, {{and told the}} studio that it had violated Fox's 1991 and 1994 deals with Gordon. Warner Bros. claimed that it was originally unaware of either deal, and that in 2005 Fox <b>had</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> produce the Hayter screenplay that {{formed the basis of}} the production. Warner Bros. also claimed that the 1994 deal did not cover distribution rights and had conferred upon Gordon all the rights he needed to take the film to Warner Bros. The studio's motion to dismiss the case in August 2008 was rejected by the judge.|$|E
5|$|Numismatist Bruce C. Goldstein {{indicated}} that several factors combined {{to keep the}} nickel three-cent piece in decline {{after the passage of}} the 1873 act. Less and less fractional currency was being redeemed, as almost a decade had passed since the issuance of three-cent notes. Rich silver strikes in the West lowered the price of that metal to the point where old silver coins emerged from hoarding and circulated again. These factors, combined with ample stocks of cents and nickels, made the three-cent nickel, a non-silver coin of odd denomination, less desirable. By 1876, the mintage for circulation <b>had</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> 162,000. None were struck for circulation in 1877 and 1878, though some proof coins were minted for sale to the public.|$|E
5|$|The 56th Academy Award {{nominations}} {{were announced}} about ten months after Tender Mercies was released. Little {{had been done}} to promote its candidacy: only four Oscar campaign advertisements were purchased; all of them appeared in the trade journal Variety, and Duvall <b>had</b> <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> campaign for himself or the film. Beresford and studio executives were surprised when the film was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Harper was believed by some to be a strong contender for either Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress, but ultimately she was nominated in neither category.|$|E
