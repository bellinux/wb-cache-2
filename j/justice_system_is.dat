25|$|Excessive {{intervention}} by a tribunal is {{a breach of}} the fair hearing requirement. The principle behind this rule was elucidated succinctly by Justice Yong Pung How. He stated that since Singapore's <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> adversarial and not inquisitorial, when hearing evidence a tribunal may seek clarification on points in the evidence which are not clear, but must at all times avoid descending into the arena and joining in the fray. The tribunal is there to judge as best it can and is not there to supplement the prosecution.|$|E
25|$|During the Qing dynasty, {{criminal}} justice {{was based on}} extremely detailed Great Qing Legal Code. One element of the traditional Chinese criminal <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> the notion that criminal law has a moral purpose, {{one of which is}} to get the convicted to repent and see the error of his ways. In the traditional Chinese legal system, a person could not be convicted of a crime unless he has confessed. This often led to the use of torture, in order to extract the necessary confession. These elements still influence modern Chinese views toward law. All capital offenses were reported to the capital and required the personal approval of the emperor.|$|E
25|$|The <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> {{independent}} of the other branches of government, and {{is made up of}} a hierarchical system of courts culminating in the High Court of Cassation and Justice, which is the supreme court of Romania. There are also courts of appeal, county courts and local courts. The Romanian judicial system is strongly influenced by the French model, considering that it is based on civil law and is inquisitorial in nature. The Constitutional Court (Curtea Constituțională) is responsible for judging the compliance of laws and other state regulations to the constitution, which is the fundamental law of the country and can only be amended through a public referendum. The 2007 entry into the EU has been a significant influence on its domestic policy, and including judicial reforms, increased judicial cooperation with other member states, and measures to combat corruption.|$|E

25|$|The {{first contact}} a {{defendant}} has {{with the criminal}} <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> usually with the police (or law enforcement) who investigate the suspected wrongdoing and make an arrest, but if the suspect is dangerous to the whole nation, a national level law enforcement agency is called in. When warranted, law enforcement agencies or police officers are empowered to use force {{and other forms of}} legal coercion and means to effect public and social order. The term is most commonly associated with police departments of a state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. The word comes from the Latin politia ("civil administration"), which itself derives from the Ancient Greek πόλις, for polis ("city"). The first police force comparable to the present-day police was established in 1667 under King Louis XIV in France, although modern police usually trace their origins to the 1800 establishment of the Marine Police in London, the Glasgow Police, and the Napoleonic police of Paris.|$|E

500|$|MacCallum {{credits the}} Xeer with [...] "Somalia's success without a central government, since it {{provides}} an authentic rule of law to support trade and economic development." [...] In the Xeer, law and crime are {{defined in terms of}} property rights; consequently the criminal <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> compensatory rather than the punitive system of the majority of states, and the Xeer is [...] "unequivocal in its opposition" [...] to any form of taxation. Powell et al. (2006) find that the existence of the common law dispute resolution system in Somalia makes possible basic economic order. MacCallum compares the Xeer to the common law in 6th century Scotland, and notes that there is no monopoly of either police nor judicial services, a condition of polycentric law. However, a weakness of such a system is that it proves ineffective at handling disputes and enforcing resolutions that cross clan boundaries. For example, in a dispute involving telecommunications company Aerolite, the plaintiff from the weaker clan was unable to collect the [...] "unfairly" [...] small settlement they had been awarded.|$|E

2500|$|Critics of nonsubordination theory {{complain}} that it offers no {{solutions to the}} problems it points out. [...] For example, proponents of nonsubordination theory criticize certain approaches that have been taken to address domestic violence in the legal system, such as mandatory arrest or prosecution policies. [...] These policies take discretion away from law enforcement by forcing police officers to arrest suspected domestic violence offenders and prosecutors to prosecute those cases. There is a lot of discourse surrounding mandatory arrest. Opponents argue that it undermines a victim's autonomy, discourages the empowerment of women by discounting other resources available and puts victims at more risk for domestic abuse. States that have implemented mandatory arrest laws have 60% higher homicide rates which {{have been shown to be}} consistent with the decline in reporting rates. Advocates of these policies contend that the criminal <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> sometimes the only way to reach victims of domestic violence, and that if an offender knows he will be arrested, it will deter future domestic violence conduct. [...] People who endorse nonsubordination theory argue that these policies only serve to further subordinate women by forcing them to take a certain course of action, thus compounding the trauma they experienced during the abuse. [...] However, nonsubordination theory itself offers no better or more appropriate solutions, which is why some scholars argue that other forms of feminist legal theory are more appropriate to address issues of domestic and sexual violence.|$|E
2500|$|Senegal {{people are}} not prosecuted for their sexual {{orientation}}. Sexual orientation in Senegal is a purely private matter. It is a private matter, nothing more. For many years now, we have seen homosexuality in our country and that has never lead to situations where homosexuals are harassed, persecuted, or prosecuted. What {{has happened is that}} there have been sutiations where shocking behavior which ran counter to our religious beliefs and morality which [...] punishes unnatural sexual relations. I would ask you to understand the social realities of our country. This is an issue which is very complex. It is a very complicated issue in Senegal. Let me say once again in Senegal homosexuals lead freely ... we even had a federal republic to authorize a homosexual to have their name changed to a woman's name in order to emphasize their feminine side. No one was shocked when the president authorized the man to adopt the woman's name. But when homosexuality becomes blatantly public, it leads to embarrassing situations. You have to understand that we are a country with a particularly tolerant form of Islam. And that is why we must avoid, we must avoid the development of fundamentalism. We must ensure social cohesion. We must also take measures to protect the lives of homosexuals. That is why I ask you to bear in mind our society, our sociological realities. This is a perfectly complicated issue for us where there are some problems but we are aware of them. ... I would like {{to go back to a}} very important issue. We are all struggling for the independence of our judges, for the independence of our justice system. If the courts hand down a decision, you cannot say the government is responsible for that court decision. The ... independent justice system which hands down a decision. And that is what the courts did in the case of the trials of these homosexuals. And I must say ... for 25 years I was a lawyer at the bar. I know the Senegalese justice system from the inside. ... Over those years there have been three cases where homosexuals were brought before the courts. The first case was an organized homosexual marriage with a lot of fuss, a lot of publicity. The police arrested them and the court case led to an acquittal. The second case of homosexuals related to a foreign national who was already rather elderly who married a young Senegalese boy. And I would like to warn you ... that if an elderly man marries a young boy, the young boy does it so that he can emigrate and go in live in France or some other country abroad, that is the interest of the young person in getting married. This led to a conviction and an appeal was made against the conviction and ... the foreigner was able to leave the country after they were acquitted on appeal. And the third case ... is the case of homosexuals who joined together again with a great deal of fuss, carried out activities which led to disturbances in the neighborhood. The neighbors complained and the police acted. This has already been tried in the first instance, and an appeal has been made against that judgment, and the <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> now dealing with this case independently on appeal.|$|E

40|$|Children {{in foster}} care and youth {{involved}} in the juvenile <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> <b>are</b> prescribed psychotropic medications at alarmingly high rates. Foster children are given psychotropic medications at a rate nine times higher than children not {{in foster care}}.

Additionally, the side effects of over-medication are endless. They can range from, but are not limited to, the less severe to the most extreme – anxiety, dizziness, confusion, and changes in behavior, to excessive weight gain, seizures, and death from liver failure. Children in foster care and youth in the juvenile <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> <b>are</b> overmedicated because they are often prescribed psychotropic medication: (1) without informed consent by the child, his/her parent, or the court-appointed guardian; (2) without the review of a full medical history and diagnostic assessment, without record keeping by the agency who has custody of the child, without protocols to monitor and review medication use on a short or long-term basis, and with inadequate court oversight; (3) to control behavior, often concomitantly with other psychotropic medication, in dosages exceeding the maximum recommendation, and for off-label use; and (4) without previous or concurrent use of any alternate therapies or psychosocial treatments.
