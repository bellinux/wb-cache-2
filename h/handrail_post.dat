40|$|This project {{conveys the}} {{processes}} and research efforts employed {{in order to}} eliminate the frequent cyclical repair of handrail anchorages affixed to coastal concrete balconies through a building code modification. This report also recognizes the benefits experienced through industry and professional partnerships, which helped expedite the code modification process by avoiding the bureaucratic and institutional barriers that have allowed the problem to continue. Typical coastal balcony corrosion issues stem from design and construction practices that increase the exposure of dissimilar metals to an environment containing abnormally high levels of moisture and chloride. Eliminating or reducing the ability for the galvanic reaction that occurs in this environment will significantly {{reduce the likelihood of}} aggressive and rapid corrosion within the balcony. x To do this, care should be taken to use the materials and methods described in this report to prevent chlorides from penetrating into grout at the <b>handrail</b> <b>posts</b> and to prevent the effect chlorides have on embedded metals, should intrusion occur. The code modification suggests two less-conductive handrail anchoring methods. Both methods forbid the use of the core-drilling method and cementitious grout. Instead, the builder is instructed to either: 1. Surface mount the <b>handrail</b> <b>posts</b> to the concrete slab 2. Pre-form handrail post-holes before concrete is placed using the ???block-out??? method and use an epoxy-based grout or equivalent material to anchor the handrails to the balcony slab. Both of these alternative methods reduce the conductive environment that perpetuates this corrosive cycle. CSU, Chic...|$|R
50|$|In 2010, the St. Simons Island {{lighthouse}} {{underwent a}} major renovation. It {{was closed to}} the public for several months while all interior and exterior paint was sandblasted off, and then repainted. Eight iron <b>handrail</b> <b>posts</b> {{at the top of the}} tower were replaced, having been recast from one of the originals. All ironwork was sandblasted and repaired as needed. Great lengths were taken to protect the valuable Fresnel lens during the restoration. It was bubble wrapped, shrink wrapped, and then finally enclosed in a plywood box. A temporary spotlight attached to the galley of the lighthouse continued to guide ships into the Sound while the main light was out of operation.|$|R
25|$|The front, {{or south}} elevation, has a center hipped wooden porch with steps. The porch has a {{spindled}} <b>handrail,</b> wooden <b>posts</b> and deck, and small brackets under the eave. The main entrance is centered {{with a single}} transom and has a Greek Revival feature of a wide trim piece over the doorway. The house has five bays on each floor. The windows on the house are all double-hung sash except for the third floor which has small lozenge windows of three vertical lights in the frieze section. With pine sills and brick lintelsthe first floor windows are 6/9 sash and reach {{to the floor in}} the front two rooms. The second floor windows are 6/6 sash.|$|R
50|$|Extending {{outward from}} the central open office space are two passageways which lead to {{stairways}} located in the side wings. The staircases and lower ground landings are intact and display terrazo flooring and steps with decorative rectangular cast-iron balustrade panels of a modern design consisting of three upright bars, the cental bar being a barley-twist. The <b>handrails</b> and upright <b>posts</b> are of timber. The ground floor landings also give access to Wharf Street via a double set of doors, the inner doors being French doors with six-panelled glass panes and the outer door of solid timber with surmounting fanlight. These landings also display original timber directory boards with glass panes.|$|R
50|$|Several early {{photographs}} {{show the}} Synod Hall {{from the early}} 1900s. The land between the hall and the cathedral was level, {{with access to the}} hall via a driveway rising up between the buildings. The north- western verandah has changed little, but there was a <b>handrail</b> between the <b>posts</b> with blinds behind. The south-eastern verandah was similar to the other, being open at the front with some infill panels of boarding between posts towards the rear. This confirms that the present Green Room was a later addition, perhaps between the wars. At the front is a decorative fretwork panel above the gable tie. On the flat land between the two buildings, photographs from the inter-war period show a structure which appears to be a tennis court.|$|R
5000|$|A stair, or a stairstep is {{one step}} in a flight of stairs. [...] In buildings, stairs is a term applied to a {{complete}} flight of steps between two floors. A stair flight is a run of stairs or steps between landings. A staircase or stairway is one or more flights of stairs leading from one floor to another, and includes landings, newel <b>posts,</b> <b>handrails,</b> balustrades and additional parts. A stairwell is a compartment extending vertically through a building in which stairs are placed. A stair hall is the stairs, landings, hallways, or other portions of the public hall through which {{it is necessary to}} pass when going from the entrance floor to the other floors of a building. Box stairs are stairs built between walls, usually with no support except the wall strings.|$|R
50|$|The two storey {{house is}} {{constructed}} of timber with an exposed stud frame {{which has been}} used to decorative effect and has a complex gabled roof clad in corrugated iron. The wide verandahs on both levels have ornate cast iron balustrading and timber <b>handrails.</b> The supporting <b>posts</b> are timber with timber capitals and brackets. There is a deep valancing between the floors. The front of the house has a bay in the verandah at both levels next to the main entrance. This is marked by a square porch which extends beyond the verandah and rises through the upper storey, so that it resembles a tower. The front door, surmounted by a large semicircular fanlight, opens into an entrance foyer; a large area with a chequerboard black and white Italian marble floor, a turned timber staircase and panelled ceiling.|$|R
50|$|The sixth bridge (No 6) is a {{pedestrian}} footbridge {{located on the}} western side of Lissner Park opposite the intersection of Jane Street. The footbridge is a beam bridge that spans the Deane Street drain. It comprises a pair of steel girders on two concrete piers and supports a timber deck (timber slabs are approximately 20 cm wide x 127 cm long x 5 cm thick) on top of which has been laid a 15 cm thick concrete slab. The bridge is 5.5 m long x 1.3 m wide and is orientated east-west. There is a round iron <b>post</b> <b>handrail</b> {{on both sides of the}} bridge. They have been painted dark green and are an extension of the railing that is evident along the western boundary of Lissner Park, which is constructed of the same type and style of material and is also painted dark green.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the age of}} 58, George Gooding {{appeared}} to be prospering as a farmer. The addition of railroad transportation to Orange Station in 1850, {{the construction of the}} east-west connecting Gooding Road, now Orange Road, in the 1840s and early 1850s, and the continuing use of the building as a tavern (a [...] "license to keep tavern" [...] was issued to George Gooding in 1853) all contributed to the ability of George Gooding to make improvements to his property. The change from Flemish bond pattern brick on the first story to common bond pattern brick on the second story provides evidence that the second floor was built after the Federal period. Early Italianate characteristics include the wide eaves with carved brackets, the segmental arch windows with six-over-six sash; and the front entry enframement. On the interior, the front stair <b>handrail</b> and newel <b>post</b> appear to date from the mid-19th century, as does the heavily-molded woodwork on the second floor.|$|R
5000|$|Alterations {{were made}} to Devonshire House by James Wyatt, over a long period, 1776-90, and later by Decimus Burton, who {{constructed}} a new portico, entrance hall and grand stair for the 6th Duke, in 1843. At this time, the external double staircase was swept away, allowing formal entrance {{to be made to}} the ground floor through the new portico. Hitherto, the ground floor had contained only secondary rooms and in 18th century fashion been the domain of servants. The new staircase conveyed guests directly to the piano nobile, from a low entrance hall, in a newly created recess formed by creating a bow at the centre of the rear garden facade. Known as the [...] "Crystal Staircase", it had a glass <b>handrail</b> and newel <b>posts.</b> Burton amalgamated several of the principal rooms; he created a vast heavily gilded ballroom from two former drawing rooms and often created double height rooms {{at the expense of the}} bedrooms above, causing the house to become even more of a place for display and entertaining rather than for living.|$|R
