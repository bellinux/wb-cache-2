5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which a polyubiquitinated protein is targeted to the proteasome is not fully understood. Ubiquitin-receptor proteins have an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and one or more ubiquitin-associated (UBA) <b>domains.</b> The UBL <b>domains</b> are recognized by the 19S proteasome caps and the UBA <b>domains</b> bind ubiquitin via three-helix bundles. These receptor proteins may escort polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome, though the specifics of this interaction and its regulation are unclear.|$|E

5|$|Following {{activation}} with antigen, B cells {{begin to}} proliferate rapidly. In these rapidly dividing cells, the genes encoding the variable <b>domains</b> {{of the heavy}} and light chains undergo {{a high rate of}} point mutation, by a process called somatic hypermutation (SHM). SHM results in approximately one nucleotide change per variable gene, per cell division. As a consequence, any daughter B cells will acquire slight amino acid differences in the variable <b>domains</b> of their antibody chains.|$|E

5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are composed}} of several protein <b>domains,</b> i.e. segments of a protein that fold into distinct structural units. <b>Domains</b> usually also have specific functions, such as enzymatic activities (e.g. kinase) or they serve as binding modules (e.g. the SH3 domain binds to proline-rich sequences in other proteins).|$|E

50|$|<b>Domain</b> {{analysis}} {{is used to}} define the <b>domain,</b> collect information about the <b>domain,</b> and produce a <b>domain</b> model.

5|$|RAFA <b>domains,</b> or {{polymorphic}} interphase karyosomal associations, {{were first}} described in microscopy studies in 1991. Their function remains unclear, {{though they were}} not thought {{to be associated with}} active DNA replication, transcription, or RNA processing.

5|$|Research into fungal prions {{has given}} strong {{support to the}} protein-only concept, since {{purified}} protein extracted from cells with a prion state has been demonstrated to convert the normal form of the protein into a misfolded form in vitro, and in the process, preserve the information corresponding to different strains of the prion state. It has also {{shed some light on}} prion <b>domains,</b> which are regions in a protein that promote the conversion into a prion. Fungal prions have helped to suggest mechanisms of conversion that may apply to all prions, though fungal prions appear distinct from infectious mammalian prions in the lack of cofactor required for propagation. The characteristic prion <b>domains</b> may vary between species—e.g., characteristic fungal prion <b>domains</b> are not found in mammalian prions.|$|E

5|$|The {{chromosomal}} region that encodes an antibody {{is large and}} contains several distinct gene loci for each domain of the antibody—the chromosome region containing heavy chain genes (IGH@) is found on chromosome 14, and the loci containing lambda and kappa light chain genes (IGL@ and IGK@) are found on chromosomes 22 and 2 in humans. One of these <b>domains</b> is called the variable domain, which is present in each heavy and light chain of every antibody, but can differ in different antibodies generated from distinct B cells. Differences, between the variable <b>domains,</b> are located on three loops known as hypervariable regions (HV-1, HV-2 and HV-3) or complementarity determining regions (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3). CDRs are supported within the variable <b>domains</b> by conserved framework regions. The heavy chain locus contains about 65 different variable domain genes that all differ in their CDRs. Combining these genes {{with an array of}} genes for other <b>domains</b> of the antibody generates a large cavalry of antibodies {{with a high degree of}} variability. This combination is called V(D)J recombination discussed below.|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic {{applies to}} any Euclidean domain: Any number from a Euclidean domain can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements. Any Euclidean domain {{is a unique}} factorization domain (UFD), although the converse is not true. The Euclidean <b>domains</b> and the UFD's are subclasses of the GCD <b>domains,</b> <b>domains</b> in which a greatest common divisor of two numbers always exists. In other words, a greatest common divisor may exist (for all pairs of elements in a domain), although {{it may not be}} possible to find it using a Euclidean algorithm. A Euclidean domain is always a principal ideal domain (PID), an integral domain in which every ideal is a principal ideal. Again, the converse is not true: not every PID is a Euclidean domain.|$|E
5|$|The outputs of a {{structural}} alignment are a superposition {{of the atomic}} coordinate sets and a minimal {{root mean square deviation}} (RMSD) between the structures. The RMSD of two aligned structures indicates their divergence from one another. Structural alignment can be complicated by the existence of multiple protein <b>domains</b> within {{one or more of the}} input structures, because changes in relative orientation of the <b>domains</b> between two structures to be aligned can artificially inflate the RMSD.|$|E

25|$|Generally, gating {{is thought}} to be {{mediated}} by additional structural <b>domains</b> which sense stimuli and in turn open the channel pore. These <b>domains</b> include the RCK <b>domains</b> of BK channels, and voltage sensor <b>domains</b> of voltage gated K+ channels. These <b>domains</b> are thought to respond to the stimuli by physically opening the intracellular gate of the pore domain, thereby allowing potassium ions to traverse the membrane. Some channels have multiple regulatory <b>domains</b> or accessory proteins, which can act to modulate the response to stimulus. While the mechanisms continue to be debated, there are known structures of a number of these regulatory <b>domains,</b> including RCK <b>domains</b> of prokayrotic and eukaryotic channels, pH gating domain of KcsA, cyclic nucleotide gating <b>domains,</b> and voltage gated potassium channels.|$|E
