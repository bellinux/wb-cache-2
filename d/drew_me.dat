He <b>drew</b> <b>me</b> into a vortex of his endless campaigns and projects... He {{introduced}} me to Bach and Brahms, and to the importance of maintaining a balance in life between the pursuit of our individual pleasures and engagements in, and responsibility for, the social condition. He believed that no class, caste or genre of people were exempt from this obligation.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all great}} artists, Licia's {{specific}} ingenuity as a singer, the originality of her art, {{lay in the}} fact that technique for this artist at least was always {{a means to an end}} and never an end in itself: for the salient features of all great art is the ability to connect technique to the emotions. Any other approach would have been for Albanese contrary to the musical sense with which she was born, contrary to musical training she acquired, and, if such exists, contrary to her musical morality. It was this, Licia's uniqueness and musical mastery which <b>drew</b> <b>me,</b> which drew us, into the world of Mimi, Cio-Cio-San, Manon, Liu and Violetta week after week, year after year, inviting me to a place and places I had never been before. It is for all these reasons that Virgil Thomson was able to write of Licia's first Violetta: 'She did not sing the role, she recreated it for our times.' As we all know, Albanese's art is capable of the widest range of effects from the tragic to the comedic, from dramatic repertoire to the lyrical and even soubrette: and for anyone fortunate enough to have heard her rendition of operetta pieces, she leaves no doubt in the mind that she was born to the operetta form as well as to the rest.|$|E
500|$|In 1942, Hand's friends {{once again}} lobbied {{for him to}} fill a Supreme Court vacancy, but Roosevelt did not appoint him. The {{president}} gave age as the reason, but philosophical differences with Hand may also have played a part. Another explanation lies in one of Justice William O. Douglas's autobiographies, where Douglas states that, despite Roosevelt's belief that Hand was the best person for the job, Roosevelt had been offended by the pressure Justice Felix Frankfurter placed on the president during a vigorous letter-writing campaign on Hand's behalf. [...] D.C. Circuit Judge Wiley Blount Rutledge, whom Roosevelt appointed, died in 1949, while Hand lived until 1961. [...] In a February 1944 correspondence with Frankfurter, Hand expressed a low opinion of Roosevelt’s new appointees, referring to Justice Hugo Black, Justice Douglas, and Justice Frank Murphy as [...] "Hillbilly Hugo, Good Old Bill, and Jesus lover of my Soul". [...] Deeply disappointed at the time, Hand later regretted his ambition: [...] "It was the importance, the power, the trappings of the God damn thing that really <b>drew</b> <b>me</b> on." ...|$|E

500|$|Her {{indirect}} {{influence on}} literature, through her salon and her many literary friendships, {{can be seen}} in the number of writers who have addressed or portrayed her in their works. [...] Claudine S'en Va (Claudine and Annie, 1903) by Colette contains a brief appearance by Barney as [...] "Miss Flossie," [...] echoing the nickname she had earlier been given in de Pougy's novel Idylle Saphique. [...] Renée Vivien wrote many poems about her, as well as a Symbolist novel, Une Femme M'Apparut (A Woman Appeared to Me, 1904), in which she is described as having [...] "eyes ... as sharp and blue as a blade.... The charm of peril emanated from her and <b>drew</b> <b>me</b> inexorably." [...] Remy de Gourmont addressed her in his Letters to the Amazon, and Truman Capote mentioned her in his last, unfinished novel [...] [...] She also appeared in two later novels by writers who never met her: Francesco Rapazzini's Un Soir chez l'Amazone (An Evening with the Amazon, 2004) is a historical novel about Barney's salon, while Anna Livia's Minimax (1991) portrays both her and Renee Vivien as still-living vampires.|$|E
500|$|According to CNN, {{he became}} a drug dealer and used the Bible that his {{grandmother}} gave him as a good luck charm. After being arrested for drug possession, the officer saw the Bible and let Lecrae go on a promise that he would agree to live by it. He eventually turned from drugs to alcohol consumption and a party lifestyle and became a [...] "misfit of a person." [...] He has described himself during this period as a thrill-seeker, he would pull stunts such as jumping from a third-story building, and gained the nickname [...] "Crazy 'Crae". Encouraged by his concerned mother to read his Bible, Lecrae said that [...] "I remember ripping the pages out of the Bible and throwing it on the floor. I don't want this Bible. I couldn't wrap my hands around this being true or real." [...] He began to drink and smoke more and look for more women [...] "as the emptiness became more profound." [...] At age 17, his personal, financial, and relationship troubles convinced {{him that he was}} at a [...] "dead end." [...] Wanting to do what he considered the mature thing, through the influence of his grandmother, he desired to start attending church. A girl Lecrae attended high school with was there, and she invited him to a Bible study, where he met Darragh, his future wife. Lecrae {{was surprised to find that}} the members of the Bible study [...] "were just people like me. [...] They read the same books and listened to the same music. Their character was just different. They were loving and that's really what <b>drew</b> <b>me</b> in." [...] Lecrae says that it was at age 19 that he finally decided to live for God, though [...] "it wasn't overnight" [...] and he [...] "spent a lot of time making bad decisions." ...|$|E

Asked if {{she might}} one day be lured back to mainstream stage, film or television, Harris said in the 2002 interview: Well, if someone handed me something fantastic for 10 million dollars, I'd work again. But I haven't worked {{in a long time}} as an actor. I don't miss it. I think the only thing that <b>drew</b> <b>me</b> to acting in the first place was the group of people I was working with: Ed Asner, Paul Sills, Mike Nichols, Elaine May. And all I really wanted to do back then was rehearsal. I was in it for the process, and I really resented having {{to go out and do}} a performance for an audience, because the process stopped; it had to freeze and be the same every night. It wasn't as interesting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{know what}} I {{am going to}} say. I love you. What other men may mean when they use that expression, I cannot tell; what I mean is, that I am under the {{influence}} of some tremendous attraction which I have resisted in vain, and which overmasters <b>me.</b> You could <b>draw</b> <b>me</b> to fire, you could <b>draw</b> <b>me</b> to water, you could <b>draw</b> <b>me</b> to the gallows, you could <b>draw</b> <b>me</b> to any death, you could <b>draw</b> <b>me</b> to anything I have most avoided, you could <b>draw</b> <b>me</b> to any exposure and disgrace. This and the confusion of my thoughts, so that I am fit for nothing, is what I mean by your being the ruin of me. But if you would return a favourable answer to my offer of myself in marriage, you could <b>draw</b> <b>me</b> to any good--every good--with equal force. My circumstances are quite easy, and you would want for nothing. My reputation stands quite high, and would be a shield for yours. If you saw me at my work, able to do it well and respected in it, you might even come to take a sort of pride in me;--I would try hard that you should. Whatever considerations I may have thought of against this offer, I have conquered, and I make it with all my heart. Your brother favours me to the utmost, and it is likely that we might live and work together; anyhow, it is certain that he would have my best influence and support. I don't know what I could say more if I tried. I might only weaken what is ill enough said as it is. I only add that if it is any claim on you to be in earnest, I am in thorough earnest, dreadful earnest.' ...|$|R

Treadwell-Collins {{confirmed}} that [...] "the discovery that Kat has a secret son will [...] ultimately lead to the Moons realising that the answers to so many questions lie across the sea in Ireland." [...] Director Jesper W.

Writer Matthew Graham said, [...] "Kathleen Moon is an unwitting bomb in Redwater and creating the debris from her explosive arrival is what <b>drew</b> <b>me</b> to this project."

She doesn't think she's good enough. That's what I use when I'm writing Kat." ...|$|E
2500|$|For a long time, Sam Raimi {{had been}} {{interested}} in adapting a comic book into a film. He had pursued and failed to secure the rights to both The Shadow and Batman and decided to create his own. The initial idea Raimi had for Darkman was {{of a man who}} could change his face. He has said that he drew inspiration from those films as well as The Phantom of the Opera and The Elephant Man. Raimi was also inspired by the Universal horror films of the 1930s and 1940s because [...] "they made me fear the hideous nature of the hero {{and at the same time}} <b>drew</b> <b>me</b> to him. I went back to that idea of the man who is noble and turns into a monster". He originally wrote a 30-page short story, titled [...] "The Darkman", and then developed into a 40-page treatment. At this point, according to Raimi, [...] "it became the story of a man who had lost his face and had to take on other faces, a man who battled criminals using this power". It also became more of a tragic love story in the tradition of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. In 1987, Raimi submitted the treatment to Universal Pictures which they liked, green-lighted a budget in the range of $8–12 million, and suggested that he get a screenwriter to flesh out the story.|$|E
2500|$|The {{discovery}} of {{the wreckage of the}} R.M.S. Titanic in 1985 attracted Yeston's interest in writing a musical about the famous disaster. [...] "What <b>drew</b> <b>me</b> to the project was the positive aspects of what the ship represented – 1) humankind's striving after great artistic works and similar technological feats, despite the possibility of tragic failure, and 2) the dreams of the passengers on board: 3rd Class, to immigrate to America for a better life; 2nd Class, to live a leisured lifestyle in imitation of the upper classes; 1st Class, to maintain their privileged positions forever. The collision with the iceberg dashed all of these dreams simultaneously, and the subsequent transformation of character of the passengers and crew had, it seemed to me, the potential for great emotional and musical expression onstage." [...] Librettist Peter Stone and Yeston knew that the idea was an unusual subject for a musical. [...] "I think if you don't have that kind of daring damn-the-torpedoes, you shouldn't be in this business. It's the safe sounding shows that often don't do well. You have to dare greatly, and I really want to stretch the bounds of the kind of expression in musical theater," [...] Yeston explained. [...] Yeston saw the story as unique to turn-of-the-century British culture, with its rigid social class system and its romanticization of progress through technology. [...] "In order to depict that on the stage, because this is really a very English show, I knew I would have to have a color similar to the one found in the music of the great composers at that time, like Elgar or Vaughan Williams; this was for me an opportunity to bring in the musical theater an element of the symphonic tradition that I think we really haven't had before. That was very exciting." ...|$|E
