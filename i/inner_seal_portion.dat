40|$|Airtightness {{of timber}} frame {{buildings}} {{not having a}} plastic film vapour barrier Good airtightness of a building {{can be achieved by}} the incorporation of an <b>inner</b> <b>sealing</b> layer for the exterior walls and roofs {{in the form of a}} plastic film, which also serves as a vapour barrier. However, if it is not wished to use plastic film as an <b>inner</b> <b>sealing</b> layer, then airtightness must be effected through the use of other materials or in some other way. This project has been concerned with investigation of a number of alternatives. It has been found that the arrangement most commonly used in Sweden today comprises polymer-based fibre sheets (which permit diffusion) and gypsum board, as alternatives to plastic film on the inside of the structure. The work of the project has shown that, provided that the materials are airtight in their own right, it is possible to achieve as good airtightness with alternative materials as can be achieved with plastic film. This has been demonstrated in the laboratory and in three of five houses in the field investigation. However, the airtightness performance of the finished building can be very poor unless care is taken both in the design and in construction, and this was also revealed in the field work...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{experimental results}} from a research facility which experimentally models hot gas ingress into the wheel-space of an axial turbine stage. Measurements of CO 2 gas concentration in the rim-seal region and inside the wheel-space are {{used to assess the}} performance of generic (though engine-representative) single and double seals in terms of the variation of concentration effectiveness with sealing flow rate. The variation of pressure in the turbine annulus, which governs externally-induced ingress, was obtained from steady pressure measurements downstream of the vanes. The benefit of using double seals is demonstrated: The ingested gas is shown to be predominately confined to the outer wheel-space radially outward of the inner seal; in the inner wheel-space, radially inward of the <b>inner</b> <b>seal,</b> the effectiveness is shown to be significantly higher. Criteria for ranking the performance of single and double seals are proposed, and the performance limit for any double seal is shown to be one in which the <b>inner</b> <b>seal</b> is exposed to rotationally-induced ingress. Although the ingress is a consequence of an unsteady, three-dimensional flow field and the cause-effect relationship between pressure and the sealing effectiveness is complex, the experimental data is shown to be successfully calculated by simple effectiveness equations developed from a theoretical model. The data illustrate that, for similar turbine-stage velocity triangles, the effectiveness can be correlated using two empirical parameters. In principle, these correlations could be extrapolated to a geometrically-similar turbine operating at enginerepresentative conditions...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{radioactive}} packagings with three-O-ring closure seals, {{the middle}} O-ring being the containment seal, {{have the potential}} for false positive results from leakage rate tests. The volume between the containment O-ring and the inner O-ring is used for the helium gas required for the leakage rate tests, to reduce both the amount of helium used and the time for the tests.

50|$|The said type of {{gate valve}} {{is having a}} {{rotating}} member inside a rotating valve chamber wherein {{the center of the}} valve chamber is off-set with the center line of the pumping cylinder and the pumping cylinder and the delivery pipe are on the same axis. Further the value of the off-set decides the thickness of the rotating member's <b>sealing</b> <b>portion</b> as it is provided a cut section equivalent to the diameter of the pumping cylinder. This invention eliminates the through hole design of the rotary valve and also introduces a replaceable cutting edge for the rotating member. Further this valve ensures that it displaces minimum concrete during its operation and ensures elimination of dead zones. Further the symmetrical design of the rotating member & the valve chamber allow the end user to repair the valve by using conventional means of machining such as a normal lathe machine. This impossible with S-tube valve or rock valve. This valve has been invented by Amit and Anand Gokhale.|$|R
40|$|A {{substantial}} part of nuclear containments in US and Europe are designed with an outer bearing concrete structure and an <b>inner</b> <b>sealing</b> consisting of a tight-welded steel liner. The liner constitutes the ultimate leak-barrier, which prevents leakage at high internal pressure loads. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to show which influence a through-wall concrete crack may have on the strain level in the liner. A non-linear bar model is used to evaluate the liner behavior. It is shown that the effect from friction between the concrete and liner could be significant and cause high concentration of plastic strain. The influence of friction on the liner is verified by an experimental program presented in this paper. One of the conclusions is that concentrations of strain due to friction increase with decreasing liner thickness. This is important to consider when results from scale tests are interpreted. Scale models, which have thinner liners, could get significantly higher liner strain than the actual full-scale containment. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} pre-swirl effectiveness and receiver hole discharge coefficient characteristics {{for a high}} radius injection pre-swirl cooling systems was carried out on a physically representative experimental rig with a 450 mm diameter rotor. The receiver holes and pre-swirl nozzle were located at a radius of 181 mm and 180 mm respectively. The experimental work was mainly conducted at 5000 - 12000 rpm, 4 bar absolute pressure and 1. 132 kg/s air supply. The maximum air supply temperature was 190 C. Pressure and temperature distributions in the pre-swirl system were examined {{with an emphasis on}} the velocity effectiveness of the pre-swirl system as a whole and on the discharge coefficients of the rotating 'receiver holes' in the rotor. The results showed that the velocity effectiveness increased with increasing swirl ratio resulting in reduced blade cooling flow temperature. Increasing the seal flow rate reduced the effectiveness. For the coefficient of discharge, it increased with increase in swirl ratio for most speeds. But the coefficient of discharge is also decrease when the increase of <b>inner</b> <b>seal</b> flow rate...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to {{describe}} an impression method of "inner circular sealing area" and to evaluate the effect of the method on retention, aesthetics and comfort of complete dentures, which lack labial base for patients with maxillary protrusions. Three patients were subjected to the experiment, and two sets of complete maxillary dentures were made for each patient; the first set was made without labial base via an <b>inner</b> circular <b>sealing</b> area method (experimental group) and the second had an intact base that was made with conventional methods (control group).
