2500|$|Suddenly, Comdr. Carpenter hollered, [...] "Hard left rudder." [...] I {{reversed}} the rudder, but the momentum was still carrying {{the ship to}} the right. The ship shuddered for several seconds and slowly started to turn left when an immense explosion took place. I glanced out the porthole and all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> a huge cloud in the direction the Juneau had been.|$|E
2500|$|Arizona's Governor Janet Napolitano {{visited the}} {{area at the}} time of the fire. [...] "This is a big, major fire, and it {{concerns}} us all," [...] she said. Regarding her aerial tour, the governor said, [...] "The fire looks a lot better today than it did a week ago. I flew over Mount Graham on July 4 and all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> smoke. Now, I can clearly see the perimeters the firefighters have been burning." [...] Napolitano provided for inmate wildland fire crews to provide fire suppression and forest thinning services.|$|E
60|$|This kept us silent {{again for}} a moment. Mabane, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>was</b> getting a little ruffled.|$|E
50|$|If <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>See</b> Dallas <b>is</b> {{the first}} album by the indie rock band Japancakes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Joe laughed, but a long howl {{close by}} made me dive for a ham; {{for in the}} {{darkness}} of the woods the beasts had got closer, and now all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>were</b> several balls of fire not many yards away. Out went the ham, and a snarling sound showed that the wolves were busy eating it.|$|R
60|$|But he {{grew tired}} of looking around, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> he <b>was</b> {{beginning}} to get frightened.|$|R
60|$|Har√ªt {{followed}} her words {{with an interest}} that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> intense, although he attempted to hide it. Then {{he asked me to}} translate them, which I did.|$|E
6000|$|... "O Black One! O thou who consumeth with rage! [Dhlangamandhla]" [...] {{broke out}} Saduko, who, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>was</b> much disturbed. [...] "I have {{something}} to say to you." ...|$|E
60|$|So we {{went into}} the smoking-room, and Lord Ragnall, who, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>was</b> annoyed, {{instantly}} fetched a blank cheque from his study and handed it to Van Koop in rather a pointed manner.|$|E
60|$|Coleyard tore it open hurriedly. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> he <b>was</b> agitated. His {{face grew}} white at once.|$|R
60|$|Mr. John came {{up by the}} car, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> he <b>was</b> {{in one of his}} moods.|$|R
60|$|JAMES. He's an ugly customer. That's all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> There <b>was</b> {{a little}} carpet bag in his hand.|$|R
60|$|The {{speaker was}} a grizzled man, middle-aged, and rather too plump for a sailor. He had a genial, good-natured countenance, {{and so far}} as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> the only {{occupant}} of the vessel.|$|E
6000|$|My heart almost {{stood still}} waiting the answer. By that answer my {{professional}} medical prestige stood or fell. Martin, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>was</b> quite {{sure it was}} going to fall. And then the answer--O blessed answer! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yea, yea," [...] {{she said}} (and I {{knew she was}} nodding her head sagaciously); I {{looked out at the}} room window, but all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> a man {{wheeling}} an empty barrow down the brae.|$|E
6000|$|The old {{man took}} us to the inn which he recommended, and we found it was the Angel. It was a nice, old-fashioned, queer English house. As far as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> they <b>was</b> all women that managed it, and it couldn't have been managed better; and as far as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> we <b>was</b> the only guests, unless there was [...] "commercial gents," [...] who took {{themselves}} away without our seeing them.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} me very intently to <b>see</b> if I <b>were</b> mocking. He laughed. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> he <b>was</b> very much moved.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> he <b>was</b> working rapidly {{with his}} hands. When he {{returned}} to me the sweat was heavy on his forehead.|$|R
60|$|The {{magistrate}} complimented {{the woman}} on her muscular powers, and the court-room laughed; but all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> a boy {{on the threshold of}} life, passionately crawling to muddy death, and there was no laughter in it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I sat {{all that}} night weaving {{strategy}} of various kinds. The only effectual remedy for my hazardous standing that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> a simple one. It was to substitute another woman {{for my wife}} before the suspicions of that one easily-hoodwinked man extended further.|$|E
60|$|I {{went into}} my room and drew the curtains, {{but there was little}} to notice. My window opened into the courtyard, all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> the warm grey of {{quickening}} sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have written of this day.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Henry {{was in the}} steward's room, {{affecting}} employment, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> he <b>was</b> only {{impatient to}} hear of my errand.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the yellow}} fog lightened, and blew across the brook and lifted and split. The {{parts of the}} canyon-slope that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>were</b> seared and blackened. The pines were columns of living coals. The fire was eating into their hearts. Presently they would snap at the trunk, crash down, and burn to ashes. Wreathes of murky smoke circled them, and drifted aloft to join the {{overhanging}} clouds.|$|R
60|$|He {{never looked}} up, though <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> he <b>was</b> getting excited under his dejection. He slapped the bench with his open palm.|$|R
6000|$|... "The only {{gift that}} I have taken from Saduko," [...] said Umbelazi, who, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>was</b> {{hard pressed to}} keep his temper, [...] "is that of his service. He is my friend, {{which is why you}} hate him, as you hate all my friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{walked a}} few steps away, and stood with his face hidden from me, {{thinking}} again. All <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> that {{he took off his}} hat and passed his handkerchief over his forehead. All I could hear was that he talked to himself excitedly in his own language.|$|E
60|$|The Times, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>was</b> {{not going}} to be of much {{assistance}} to me. I lit a cigarette, and remarked that he was not shooting. He admitted the fact. Under the circumstances, it would have taxed him to deny it, but the necessity for confession aroused him.|$|E
60|$|Harmmed was the butler. When {{he entered}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> he <b>was</b> labouring under {{controlled}} excitement. He came {{at once to}} the point.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> he <b>was</b> not at ease, so I {{took his}} poor old {{wrinkled}} hand in mine {{and asked him}} to speak fully.|$|R
60|$|During my stay {{upon the}} island, {{so far as}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> there <b>was</b> little to denote that any change {{had taken place in}} the government.|$|R
60|$|I {{tried to}} read, I tried to write, I paced about the lawn, I {{walked to the}} end of the lane, I put new flies upon my fishing-hooks, I began to index my father's library--in a dozen ways I endeavoured to relieve the {{suspense}} which was becoming intolerable. My sister, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>was</b> suffering from the same feverish restlessness.|$|E
60|$|Following {{our path}} of the night before, we walked up a ruined street which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> only one of scores in {{what had once been}} a very great city, until we came to the archway that I have mentioned, a large one now {{overgrown}} with plants that from their yellow, sweet-scented bloom I judged to be a species of wallflower, also with a kind of houseleek or saxifrage.|$|E
60|$|It is {{only fair}} {{to me to}} say that Miss Taft had never {{indicated}} in any way that she was mortgaged to another, and no one--so far as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>was</b> more in her favor than I, hence I was not entirely to blame in the case. My inferences were logical. So far as her words and actions were concerned I was justified in my hope that she might consent.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I hardly {{was like}} my usual self, for I scared her--that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> It <b>was</b> right: she must be scared to be won.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not the {{slightest}} curiosity that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> It <b>is</b> {{enough for her}} that you are to be cured. The rest she leaves to the doctor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Within a {{few feet}} of me an engine and a single {{carriage}} had pulled up. At intervals along the line as far as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> soldiers <b>were</b> stationed like sentries. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that they <b>were</b> looking sharply up and down, and even a little way into the wood. From the train three or four men in long cloaks had already descended. They were standing in the track talking together." ...|$|R
