2500|$|Dive Bomber is {{characterized}} as [...] "Warner's {{tribute to the}} pre-Pearl Harbor U.S. Navy." [...] Based on a screenplay adapted from an original story by Commander Frank [...] "Spig" [...] Wead, USN (Ret), Dive Bomber features spectacular flying scenes (as in other films with a scenario written by Wead) interwoven into a storyline of medical research undertaken to combat the effects of high [...] "G" [...] combat maneuvers. The [...] "Schneider Index" [...] test playing {{a pivotal role in}} the plot in the story was actually a cardiovascular <b>fatigue</b> <b>test</b> familiar to pilots of the era. Developed in 1918 by Major Edward C. Schneider, an aviation medicine pioneer with the Air Service of the AEF, it was widely used by the military until World War II, when statistical analysis showed that a much simpler measurement was equally effective.|$|E
40|$|International audienceUltrasonic <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> (test {{frequency}} : 20 kHz) {{and conventional}} tension-compression <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> (10 Hz) {{have been conducted}} on annealed and 10 % pre-strained specimens of 0. 13 % carbon steel. Small holes were introduced on the specimen surface to investigate the effect of test frequency on small crack growth. The dynamic stress concentration factor and the stress intensity factor under ultrasonic <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> were checked to be almost {{the same as those}} of conventional tension-compression <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests.</b> However, the <b>fatigue</b> properties were dependent on the <b>test</b> frequency. Ultrasonic <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> showed longer <b>fatigue</b> life and lower fatigue crack growth rate for the annealed and 10 % pre-strained specimens. Slip bands were scarce in the neighborhood of cracks under ultrasonic <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests,</b> while many slip bands were observed in a wide area around the crack under conventional <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests.</b> In order to explain the effect of <b>test</b> frequency on <b>fatigue</b> strength, dynamic compression tests with Split Hopkinson Bars were carried out. The stress level increases substantially with the strain rate. Thus, the increase in fatigue strength might be, to a large extent, due to a reduction in crack tip cyclic plasticity during ultrasonic <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractA helium inlet and {{dummy joint}} between {{conductors}} {{are one of}} the most important elements of the winding pack of the ITER PF - 1 coil double pancakes. A helium inlet is used for letting liquid helium into the PF- 1 coil conductor. A full-scale helium inlet sample for <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> and the respective tooling were designed and manufactured. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> of the full-scale helium inlet sample were conducted in accordance with ITER requirements testing parameters in order to check the fatigue strength of the structure. Before the <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> thermo-cycling of the helium inlet in the temperature range of 77  to 293  K was conducted. Before and after the <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> the leak tightness of the full-scale helium inlet sample was validated by the vacuum chamber method. A low ohm electrical joint is used to connect two NbTi «CICC» conductors of PF- 1 coil into a single electrical loop. To qualify the design and technology of manufacturing of the electrical joint, a full-scale dummy joint sample was developed for <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> at 77  K. The main design feature of the full-scale dummy joint sample for <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> is a symmetrical model of two dummy joint samples with simultaneous loading to compensate the bending moment. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> of the full-scale helium inlet sample at 77  K have been successfully conducted in 2013. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> of the full-scale dummy joint sample will be conducted in 2014. This paper represents the results of calculating the stress-strain state of the symmetrical model of the full-scale dummy joint sample for <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> with the prescribed loading and strain, the work on designing the symmetrical model of the dummy joint sample for <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> and the test facility for conducting <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> at 77  K.

500|$|When A-10 {{full rate}} {{production}} was first authorized the planned service life was 6,000 hours. A small reinforcement {{to the design}} was quickly adopted when the A-10 failed initial <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> at 80% of testing; with the fix, the A-10 passed the <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests.</b> 8,000 flight hour service lives were becoming common at the time, so <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> of the A-10 continued with a new 8,000 hour target. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> for the new target quickly discovered serious cracks at Wing Station 23 (WS23) where the outboard portions of the wings are joined to the fuselage.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the Special Operations Forces Modernization Action Plan {{indicated}} {{need for a}} Ranger Anti-Armor/Anti-Personnel Weapon System (RAAWS) to replace the M67 recoilless rifle in use by the 75th Ranger Regiment. A market survey in 1987 indicated that the Carl Gustaf M3 was the best candidate for satisfying RAAWS requirements.

A subsequent review of the contractor-supplied <b>fatigue</b> <b>test</b> data determined that the data did not meet U.S. Army requirements. Benét Laboratories conducted <b>fatigue</b> <b>test</b> of two tubes to establish an interim safe service life for the weapon. Tests were conducted in 1993. The manufacturer’s recommended life for the weapon was 500 rounds, but bore surfaces showed no indications of erosion until 2,360 rounds. The U.S. Navy SEALs became interested in the program and moved it to a Joint Integrated Product Team. The program name subsequently changed from the RAAWS to the Multi-Role Anti-Armor Anti-Personnel Weapon System (MAAWS).|$|E
