5|$|<b>Fund</b> <b>accounting</b> {{distinguishes between}} two primary classes of fund. Those funds {{that have an}} {{unrestricted}} use, that can be spent for any purposes by the organisation and those that have a restricted use. The reason for the restriction can be {{for a number of}} different reasons. Examples include legal requirements, where the moneys can only be lawfully used for a specific purpose, or a restriction imposed by the donor or provider. These donor/provider restrictions are usually communicated in writing and may be found in the terms of an agreement, government grant, will or gift.|$|E

5|$|<b>Fund</b> <b>{{accounting}}</b> is {{an accounting}} system for recording resources whose use {{has been limited}} by the donor, grant authority, governing agency, or other individuals or organisations or by law. It emphasizes accountability rather than profitability, and is used by Nonprofit organizations and by governments. In this method, a fund consists of a self-balancing set of accounts and each are reported as either unrestricted, temporarily restricted or permanently restricted based on the provider-imposed restrictions.|$|E
