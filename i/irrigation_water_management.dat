The household and community level practices and the farmers’ levels of participation in <b>irrigation</b> <b>water</b> <b>management</b> of the NHLIP were carefully considered.

40|$|This is {{a journal}} article. The {{original}} publication {{is available at}} www. springerlink. comStudies of the performance assessment of irrigation schemes have gained momentum since the late 1980 s due to the common perspective that the resources (land and water) in irrigation schemes are not being managed appropriately. In this paper “irrigation water management” is considered {{as one of the}} activities of the irrigation scheme. Three phases of <b>irrigation</b> <b>water</b> <b>management</b> namely planning, operation and evaluation are identified. A framework for the performance assessment of <b>irrigation</b> <b>water</b> <b>management</b> in heterogeneous irrigation schemes is proposed in this paper, based on earlier studies made in this direction. The paper presents two types of allocative measures (productivity and equity) and five types of scheduling measures (adequacy, reliability, flexibility, sustainability and efficiency), together with the methodologies for estimating these for the scheme as a whole during different phases of <b>irrigation</b> <b>water</b> <b>management...</b>|$|E
