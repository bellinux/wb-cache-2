50|$|Design {{advocacy}} included {{seminars and}} exhibitions, {{the education of}} the designers in the workshops led to the potential for good design to spread out of the Kilkenny Graduate Programmes which refined the skills of young designers. Many of those who partook in programmes ran by KDW went on to establish their own creative enterprises or teach in design departments at second and third level in Ireland. KDW also had participation in and representation on international <b>design</b> <b>organisations</b> including the World Crafts Council, ICSID and ICOGRADA. Later KDW itself became an inspiration and a model for design development in other countries, its legacy spread to several countries around the world interested in building up design for industry and using KDW’s example as a template for establishing this approach in their own country.|$|E
50|$|The Prince Philip Designers Prize was instigated by CSD's Patron, HRH The Duke of Edinburgh in 1959 and {{was awarded}} {{annually}} until 2011. The award {{was made to}} a British designer or design-team leader whose exemplary work has {{had an effect on}} the perception of design by the public, and on the status of designers in society. A representative from the CSD, along with those from other <b>design</b> <b>organisations,</b> sat on the panel of judges who met at Buckingham Palace to determine the winner from a shortlist of inspiring designers in all fields of activity. The nominations were received from various professional bodies. The winner of the Prince Philip Designers Prize in 2005 was the influential graphic designer Derek Birdsall FCSD. Design engineer Alex Moulton and architect Edward Cullinan were both awarded special commendations. The award is currently under review, the last recipient being Quentin Blake CBE FCSD RDI who was nominated by the Society.|$|E

50|$|Era '05 {{was another}} major {{collaborative}} effort by Icograda, ICSID and IFI {{to stage a}} fifth Joint Congress. The theme for the main Congress was 'The Changing Role and Challenges of Design' which attracted participation by designers, business leaders, politicians, legal practitioners and social scientists. A milestone in the cooperative efforts between leading <b>design</b> <b>organisations</b> in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, Era 05 {{was built on the}} ideal that as a creative force, design and designers were integral in helping to address the challenges all faced and identifying solution to cope with a rapidly changing and increasingly complex world. In September, Era '05 began with small-scale pre-congress events hosted in Oslo, Helsinki and Gothenburg. The main Congress took place in Copenhagen and featured 126 speakers from 27 countries and was attended by around 900 delegates. At the 21st Icograda General Assembly that followed, Jacques Lange (South Africa) became president and Lise Vejse Klint (Denmark) was elected Secretary General. The newly elected board was now the most geographically diverse in Icograda's history with members from South Africa, South Korea, Canada, Denmark, Lebanon, USA, Australia and Brazil.

Design Local: Stop at all stations, Icograda Design Week in Mumbai, India took place from 5-9 February and included a student workshop and international conference. Design/Culture: Icograda World Design Congress in La Habana was held in Cuba from 20-26 October.

At the 22nd Icograda General Assembly that followed, Don Ryun Chang (South Korea) became president and Lise Vejse Klint (Denmark) was again elected Secretary General. Highlights from the GA included the ratification of update definition of the profession from ‘Graphic Design’ to ‘Communication Design', approval of revisions to Regulations and best practice for organizing design awards competitions, the introduction of Icograda best practice statement on soliciting work from professional communication designers, substantial revisions to the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws include a ‘one member one vote’ system and granting of voting rights to Education Members (excluding on professional practice issues), establishment of an IDA Taskforce to explore options for future development, launch of INDIGO (Indigenous Design Network) as part of IDA portfolio led by Icograda. In addition the Icograda Foundation Lecture re-introduced on 25 October at Museo Nacional Bellas Artes, La Habana which included the presentation of the Icograda President’s Award which went to Guy-A Schockaert for his tireless advocacy of professional <b>design</b> <b>organisations</b> and his commitment to Icograda, and the presentation of the first Icograda Education Award which was bestowed on Hazel Gamec from the Wanganui School of Design, New Zealand.|$|E

40|$|Product and {{interaction}} designers are important beneficiaries of ergonomics research. The availability of ergonomics data, guidelines, models, methods, techniques and case studies {{which could be}} used during the design process is immense. Despite this, {{a review of the literature}} suggests that these resources are not exploited or effectively implemented within the design process due to cultural differences in design approach. However, implicit in the literature is the notion that designers have empathy and covert understanding of ergonomics principles. Two studies are described which investigate how far ergonomics methods pervade <b>design</b> <b>organisations.</b> The first study, a telephone survey, explores how and what type of current ergonomics principles are currently used in 48 commercial consulting organisations. The second study contrasts two <b>design</b> <b>organisations</b> to gain more detailed insights into how different design cultures can affect the adoption of ergonomics principles. Broad conclusions are drawn on what type of delivery mechanisms should be provided in order that the implementation of ergonomics principles is more effective...|$|E
