5|$|From the 1840s, use of {{the river}} declined, {{as a result of}} {{competition}} from the railways, and changes in coastal shipping. Littlehampton grew in importance as a port and after years of resistance by the people of Arundel, the customs house was moved there in 1864. The Mid-Sussex Railway opened their line from Horsham to Pulborough and Petworth in 1859, which was extended to Ford and Littlehampton in 1863. Receipts from tolls had peaked at £2044 for the <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> 1835 to 1840, when a dividend of 11.8 percent was paid, but dropped quickly, raising just £389 for years between 1870 and 1875, when the dividend was 1 percent.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{pancreatic}} cancers of {{all types}} resulted in 411,600 deaths globally.

5|$|Legislative {{power is}} divided between {{federal and state}} legislatures. The {{bicameral}} federal parliament consists of the lower house, the House of Representatives and the upper house, the Senate.

All 70 senators sit for three-year terms; 26 are elected by the 13 state assemblies, and the remaining 44 are appointed by the King upon the Prime Minister's recommendation.

5|$|The {{establishment}} of the National Football League in 1920 featured early franchises haphazardly formed and often saddled with financial difficulties, poor player talent and attendance rates. As the league expanded through the years, players were provided with no formal representation and received few, if any, benefits. In 1943, Roy Zimmerman's refusal to play an exhibition game without compensation resulted in his trade from the Washington Redskins to the Philadelphia Eagles. With {{the formation of the}} competing All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1946, NFL owners instituted a rule which banned a player for <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> NFL-associated employment if he left the league to join the AAFC.|$|E
