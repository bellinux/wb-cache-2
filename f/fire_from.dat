5|$|After {{the capture}} of Hill 314 on September 12, the {{situation}} north of Taegu improved. On September 14 the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, attacked and, supported by <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> Hill 314, gained part of Hill 570 from the NK 19th Regiment, 13th Division.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{the lead}} T-34s reached the minefield, they came under heavy <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> the fort's garrison. Soon all three tanks were either {{destroyed}} or damaged, so the combat engineers proceeded to breach the minefield on their own. Israeli aircraft began strafing and bombing the Egyptian forces for over {{two and a half}} hours while encountering no resistance, leading to the destruction of all six tanks and five vehicles. The Israelis bombed Egyptian forces at the minefield and on an area of the strip stretching two kilometers towards Port Fouad. Under <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> the air and from the fort, the attack bogged down to a complete halt before the Egyptians began to retreat. Salah ordered his battalion to assume defensive positions east of Port Fouad to repel any Israeli counterattack and to regroup.|$|E
5|$|Determined {{to prevent}} the Dutch from {{refloating}} the grounded ships, Admiral Pellew ordered landing parties to assemble in the boats of his squadron alongside Terpsichore. From there, under distant covering <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> the British frigates, Fleetwood Pellew led the boats against Phoenix, coming under <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> the grounded vessels and gun batteries ashore. Passing through the bombardment from the shoreline, Pellew's men boarded Phoenix {{to find that the}} Dutch crew had just abandoned the vessel, scuttling the frigate as they departed. Although now useless as a ship, Phoenixs guns were turned on the other beached vessels to cover the British boats as they spread out to board and burn them. This operation was followed by the destruction of 20 grounded merchant ships in the harbour, although two others were successfully refloated and captured. In a final act before withdrawing to the squadron offshore, Captain Pellew set fire to the wreck of Phoenix, burning the ship to the waterline. The entire operation was conducted under heavy <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> the shore, but British casualties were only one Royal Marine killed and three men wounded.|$|E
50|$|Beckett was <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> WZZR in 1980 {{and moved}} on to do radio at WAAY-AM (now WLOR) in Huntsville, Alabama. He was <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> WAAY in mid-1984 and {{returned}} to Cypress Gardens to work at WZNG-AM (now WHNR). He was also <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> WZNG.|$|R

5|$|General Clinton began {{movements}} {{to cross over}} to {{the northern end of}} Sullivan's Island. Assisted by two sloops of war, the flotilla of longboats carrying his troops came under <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> Colonel William Thomson's defenses. Facing a withering barrage of grape shot and rifle fire, Clinton abandoned the attempt.|$|E
50|$|A close {{examination}} of the trial transcript and the most reasonable interpretation of the evidence is that Davis killed Grimm while <b>firing</b> <b>from</b> the Avalon Hotel; McElfresh {{was killed by a}} Wobbly <b>firing</b> <b>from</b> the IWW hall, and that Cassagranda was killed while running west on Second Avenue by a revolver probably fired by Davis <b>firing</b> <b>from</b> the Avalon Hotel.|$|R
25|$|Of the 104 Dealey Plaza earwitness reports {{published}} by the Commission and elsewhere, 56 recorded testimony that they remembered hearing at least one shot <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> {{the direction of the}} Depository or from near its Houston and Elm Streets intersection that was {{to the rear of the}} President, 35 witnesses recorded testimony of at least one shot <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the direction of the grassy knoll or the triple underpass located to the right and front of the President, eight witnesses gave statements of shots <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> elsewhere, and five earwitnesses testified that the shots were <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> two different directions.|$|R

5|$|On 13 September, {{a platoon}} of the 2/25th Infantry Battalion came under very heavy <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> a {{concealed}} Japanese machine gun near Heath's Plantation that wounded a number of Australians, including Corporal W. H. (Billy) Richards, and halted the platoon's advance. Private Richard Kelliher suddenly, on his own initiative, dashed toward the post and hurled two grenades at it, which killed some of the Japanese defenders but not all. He returned to his section, seized a Bren gun, dashed back to the enemy post and silenced it. He then asked permission to go out again to rescue the wounded Richards, which he accomplished successfully under heavy <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> another enemy position. Kelliher was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March during routine {{operations}} {{involving the}} inspection of fishing craft for contraband arms and supplies, the chief engineer, Chief Engineman Morris S.

50|$|The RAK is a selective-fire {{straight}} blowback-operated {{weapon that}} <b>fires</b> <b>from</b> the open bolt position. Unlike most submachine guns <b>firing</b> <b>from</b> an open bolt, the PM-63 has a reciprocating external breech bolt, {{also known as}} a slide.|$|R
50|$|On June 19, three Grad rockets were <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the Gaza Strip, {{hitting the}} Israeli town of Ashkelon. The attacks caused no injuries, marking {{the first time}} that rockets had been <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> Gaza since April 29.|$|R
50|$|This mosque usually remains closed {{throughout}} the year. However, this mosque is opened during prominent occasions like Eid-ul Zoha, Eid ul-Fitr {{and also for}} public prayers. Earlier a single gun was <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the Hazarduari Palace and several other gums were <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> several other places - one was <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> here - to proclaim the different intervals of the hours for the meals and prayers during the great fast of Ramzan.|$|R
5|$|On {{the left}} {{flank of the}} attack, Brockenbrough's brigade was devastated by {{artillery}} <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> Cemetery Hill. They were also subjected to a surprise musket fusillade from the 8th Ohio Infantry regiment. The 160 Ohioans, firing from a single line, so surprised Brockenbrough's Virginians—already demoralized by their losses to artillery fire—that they panicked and fled back to Seminary Ridge, crashing through Trimble's division and causing many of his men to bolt as well. The Ohioans followed up with a successful flanking attack on Davis's brigade of Mississippians and North Carolinians, which was now the left flank of Pettigrew's division. The survivors were subjected to increasing artillery <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> Cemetery Hill. More than 1,600 rounds were fired at Pettigrew's men during the assault. This portion of the assault never advanced much farther than the sturdy fence at the Emmitsburg Road. By this time, the Confederates were close enough to be fired on by artillery canister and Alexander Hays' division unleashed very effective musketry <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> behind 260 yards of stone wall, with every rifleman of the division lined up {{as many as four}} deep, exchanging places in line as they fired and then fell back to reload.|$|E
5|$|San Martín's {{column was}} the first one to reach the enemy. The two cannons and the cannon <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> the ships defended the royalists, but they were quickly outmanoeuvred by the saber attacks and, unable to form a square, had to retreat. The {{advantage}} of surprise and the speed of the cavalry charge allowed the regiment to defeat the larger royalist army who had almost double the number of soldiers. When Bermúdez and his column joined the battle the royalists were not able to stand their ground and were routed, retreating in disarray under covering <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> the ships. Bermudez led the attack at this point as San Martín had fallen from his horse.|$|E
5|$|The highly {{controversial}} ending to the episode, {{which has since}} been referenced and parodied many times, prompted more than 1,000 letters to series producers Gene Reynolds and Larry Gelbart, and drew <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> both CBS and 20th Century Fox.|$|E

50|$|This was {{the only}} nuclear {{artillery}} shell ever actually <b>fired</b> (<b>from</b> an artillery gun) in the US test program. It was <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> a specially built artillery piece, nicknamed Atomic Annie. Eighty shells were produced from 1952-53. It was retired in 1957.|$|R
50|$|The missile is {{designed}} to be <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> vehicles, although it can also be <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the later models of 9M111 launchers.

5|$|The {{next morning}} five North Korean T-34 tanks crossed {{the river and}} moved toward Hamch'ang. Artillery <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> A Battery of the 90th Field Artillery Battalion knocked out four of the tanks immediately. The fifth moved back across the river, where an air strike later {{destroyed}} it.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} pilots of I./JG 1 and II./JG 1 {{started their}} homeward journey, some of whom, like Fw. Paul Wunderlich, were downed by enemy flak. They also came under <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> friendly flak, downing even more pilots.|$|E

5000|$|While a {{standard}} 40gr [...]22 Magnum (.22 WMR) round reaches velocities near 2,000 fps (600 m/s) [...] at about 355 ft/lbs of energy (Energy = [...]5 * weight * velocity^2 / 7000 / 32.175) when <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> a rifle, the velocity and energy is significantly lower when <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> a handgun {{due to the}} shorter barrel. A standard 40gr [...]22 Magnum round <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> the PMR-30 is approximately equal in velocity and energy to {{a standard}} 40gr [...]22LR round <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> a rifle. At 1,200 ft/s (370 m/s), this is 127 ft/lbs of energy. Lighter bullets and various [...]22 Magnum ammunition with faster burning powder specifically manufactured for use in handguns {{can be expected to}} reach higher velocities and greater energies.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{ballistic}} missile were <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> underground missile {{bases in the}} various locations.

In the second day, Ghadr-H and Ghadr-F ballistic missiles were launched and <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> Alborz province toward a target in the Makran area, Gulf of Oman. Ghadr-H and Ghadr-F can travel 1400 and 2000 kilometers, respectively. Iranian written in Hebrew on the missiles that [...] "Israel must be wiped out." ...|$|R
5|$|Wellington's forces {{positioning}} {{presented a}} formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack {{on his right}} centre would mean the attackers would have to march between enfilading <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the other garrisoned buildings on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain defile.|$|E
5|$|A large {{squadron}} of ten frigates, including Aigle, was eventually {{able to make}} its way up the western passage on 9 August, enduring <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> batteries {{on both sides of}} the river for more than two hours. Aigle, in the centre, had her stern frame shattered when a shell fell through the deck and exploded, killing a marine and wounding four other members of the crew. She was the only ship to suffer any damage and her casualties amounted to almost half the total of two killed and nine wounded.|$|E
5|$|A second regimental-sized {{attack against}} 3 RAR at Balmoral was {{launched}} by the North Vietnamese at 02:30 on 28 May, with a two-battalion assault preceded by 60mm and 80mm mortar <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> the south. Meanwhile, FSB Coral was also attacked by indirect <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> 02:45. Similar to the attack two nights before, it began with another feint from the south as the North Vietnamese sappers blew up the wire in front of A Company, but was successfully broken up before it reached the wire by the Australian defenders with claymore mines and small-arms <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> their M60 machine-guns, L1A1 Self Loading Rifles and M16 assault rifles. The main assault began at 03:10 from the north-east, with the brunt again being borne by Phillips' D Company. The Australian infantrymen were once again supported by tanks firing canister shot and machine-guns, while artillery and mortars provided continuous close indirect fires, with the combined effect of this firepower stopping the North Vietnamese on the wire before they could penetrate the position. Although the assault was well co-ordinated, the North Vietnamese had lost the element of surprise, with the preparatory fire once more alerting the defenders. The assault was subsequently called off after 30 minutes, while at 03:40 a small probe developed from the east but quickly dissipated. Sporadic mortar and rocket fire continued to fall as helicopter light-fire teams and C-47 Spooky gunships engaged the North Vietnamese, directed by forward air control aircraft. From 05:00 until first light artillery from FSB Coral provided continuous battlefield illumination to stymie North Vietnamese attempts to clear their dead and wounded, and they finally withdrew by 05:30.|$|E
