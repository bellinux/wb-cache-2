40|$|Abstract. Conventionally, a {{motorcycle}} has headlight and mirrors to provide front illumination and rear views for drivers, respectively. Rearview mirrors on conventional motorcycles are fixed, which {{is easy to}} cause instant rear blind area for drivers on turns or <b>hubbly</b> roads. Therefore, the drivers cannot get traffic information behind motorcycles, and easily lead to traffic accidents. In this paper, actuation for an adaptive rearview mirror system for motorcycles was proposed. According to sensor inputs, this system adaptively adjusts the rearview mirrors to compensate the changes of vehicle dynamics in pitching, steering and rolling under different road conditions. A grey predictor was also developed in this paper to estimate the change of vehicle dynamics in advance. With the properly designed actuation, this system can provide wide and appropriate rear views to motorcycle riders. It significantly enhances riders â€™ safety and reduces the occurrence of traffic accidence...|$|E
