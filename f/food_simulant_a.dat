Homogeneity and stability studies were conducted. Participants had to carry out a migration test by immersion with <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> <b>A</b> for 10 days at 60 oC, to quantify the migration of caprolactam (CAP) in <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> <b>A,</b> and to provide details of the analytical and sample extraction procedure. In addition a by-product 2, 4 -di-tert butyl phenol (2, 4 -DTBP) was also present and had to be quantified. The assigned values of the migration of the migrant were calculated as the robust mean of the results reported by the participants by applying the Q/Hampel method robust statistics. The participation to the ILC was satisfactory with 28 out of 29 participating laboratories submitting results. The z-score values of the laboratories for each substance were calculated based on the assigned value. In the case of CAP and also for the more challenging non intentionally added substances 2, 4 -DTBP more than 82 % of the results were fully satisfactory (|z-score|< 2). This percentage rose to close to 90 % for z-scores < 3 in the compliance evaluation of the regulated substance CAP. JRC. F. 7 -Knowledge for Health and Consumer Safet...|$|E
40|$|Four {{approaches}} for testing for overall migration and specific chemical migration from microwave susceptors were evaluated. The methods used olive oil as a conventional liquid <b>food</b> <b>simulant,</b> <b>a</b> semisolid simulant {{of olive oil}} and water absorbed onto diatomaceous earth, Tenax(TM) as a dry simulant, and compositional analysis of the susceptor by ASTM methods. The different methods were tested on five susceptor types used for the packaging of pizza, potato chips (French fries), pasty, popcorn, and a curry. For the comparison, the susceptor materials were impregnated with model substances as migration markers covering a range of molecular weight, volatility and polarity. Levels of specific migration (SM) and overall migration (OM) were determined using the four test methods, which were then evaluated {{on the basis of}} their ease and reproducibility of use along with the agreement between specific migration levels into simulants compared with migration into foods. There were severe problems with olive oil as a conventional liquid simulant as it was absorbed by the susceptor and made SM and OM measurements difficult. Humidity conditioning the susceptor for OM was a further difficulty with olive oil. Oil absorption was also a problem using the semisolid simulant, with OM being untried using this approach. The ASTM methods were found to be time-consuming, although the results for SM were similar to those obtained for foods. Overall, however, using Tenax was the preferred method for migration testing of susceptors. It allowed easy measurement of both OM and SM, SM values were generally much higher than for foods, however, and a reduction factor would be required for control of regulated ingredients. For other substances, such as thermal degradation products, a threshold of regulation approach applied to the Tenax extract would be a simple and effective control measure...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe have {{constructed}} a 2 dimensional probabilistic model {{to estimate the}} short-term dietary exposure of UK consumers to any generalised migrant from coated light metal food packaging. Using 3 UK National Dietary and Nutrition Surveys (NDNS) comprising 4 - 7 day dietary surveys for different age and gender groups, actual body weights and survey years, a sample representative of the dietary consumption of the UK population was obtained, comprising around 4200 food items. Interrogation of the raw data showed that the per capita consumption of food and beverage for an adult was 2. 9 kg/person/day, being comparable with the USFDA value of 3 kg. The packaging type of each food item was assigned from the survey descriptions or, by sampling from distributions based upon market share information and expert judgement. Each food item {{was assigned to the}} relevant <b>food</b> <b>simulant,</b> <b>A</b> (aqueous), B (acidic) or D (fatty) so that simulant migration data could be used. The exposure model was used to evaluate exposure for a given level of migration and, conversely, the level of migration that could be tolerated whilst keeping within a target threshold exposure level. As examples, migration at 10 mg/dm² into fatty foods only resulted in an exposure ranging from 0. 06 to 0. 22 ug/kg body (actual) weight/day depending on the scenario. The model revealed that if migration from metal coatings was into fatty foods only, migration in the range 1. 83 to 4. 95 µg/dm 2 (97. 5 th percentile, depending on the scenario) would give an exposure of less than 1. 5 µg per person per day. This is a toxicological threshold limit used in the USA. If migration into simulants A and B is also considered to be at the same level as that for simulant D, then the level of migration for the threshold to be reached is, not surprisingly, lower at (0. 64 – 0. 87 ug/dm²) than that if migration were into fatty foods only. In this case, clearly, the main contributors to the exposure were foodstuffs represented by simulants A and B because of their importance in the diet. These estimates are based on 4 - or 7 -days food diaries and chronic exposure over the long term would be expected to be lower...|$|E

40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} is revolutionizing processing in {{many applications}} including 3 -D food printing. So far {{the number of}} suitable printable materials for food is limited and the microstructure and texture properties of 3 -D printed food have been characterized poorly. This study introduces the novel concept of customizable water-based porous <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> by 3 -D printing using low methoxylated pectin gel as food-ink. A series of pectin gels was successfully 3 -D printed by changing the formulation parameters including stirring rate and pectin, CaCl 2, bovine serum albumin and sugar syrup concentrations. It was shown that food objects with variable microstructure and texture properties can be 3 -D printed by using different pectin based food-inks. The pectin concentration was the main determinant of firmness and strength of the printed object. Sugar and pectin concentrations increased viscosity and affected the build quality. BSA stabilized and promoted the aeration of the food-ink. This resulted in a pore size distribution after printing that {{was influenced by the}} viscosity of the food-ink.

40|$|International audiencePoly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) bottles {{are widely}} used for beverages. Knowledge about the {{migration}} of organic compounds from the PET bottle wall into contact media is of interest especially when post-consumer recyclates are introduced into new PET bottles. Using migration theory the migration of a compound can be calculated if the concentration in the bottle wall is known. On the other hand, for any given specific migration limits or maximum target concentration for organic chemical compounds in the bottled foodstuff, the maximum allowable concentrations in the polymer CP, 0 can be calculated. Since <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> cannot exactly simulate the real migration into the foodstuff or beverages, a worse case simulation behaviour is the intention. However, if the migration calculation should not be too over-estimative, the polymer specific kinetic parameter for migration modelling, the so-called AP value, should be established appropriately. One objective {{of the study was}} the kinetic determination of the specific migration behaviour of low molecular weight compounds such as solvents with relatively high diffusion rates and therefore with high migration potential from the PET bottle wall into <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> in comparison with real beverages. For this purpose model contaminants were introduced into the bottle wall during preform production. The volatile compounds toluene and chlorobenzene were established at concentrations from about 20 to 30 ppm up to 300 to 350 ppm. Phenyl cyclohexane was present at concentrations of 35 ppm, 262 ppm and 782 ppm, respectively. The low volatile compounds benzophenone and methyl stearate have bottle wall concentrations of about 100 ppm in the low spiking level up to about 1000 ppm in the highly spiked test bottle. From these experimental data the polymer specific parameters (AP values) from mathematical migration modelling were derived. The experimental determined diffusing coefficients were determined, calculated and compared with literature data and an AP' value of 1 was derived thereof for non-swelling <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> like 3 % acetic acid, 10 % ethanol or iso-octane. For more swelling condition e. g. 95 % ethanol as <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> <b>an</b> AP' value of 3. 1 seems to be suitable for migration calculation. In relation to PET recycling safety aspects, maximum concentrations in the bottle wall were established for migrants / contaminants with different molecular weights, which correspond with a migration limit of 10 ppb. From the experimental data obtained using <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> and in comparison with beverages, the most appropriate <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> for PET packed foods with a sufficient but not too over-estimative worse case character was found to be 50 % ethanol. In addition, it can be shown that mass transport from PET is generally controlled by the very low diffusion in the polymer and, as a consequence, partitioning coefficients (KP/F values) of migrants between the polymer material and the foodstuff do not influence the migration levels significantly. An important consequence is that migration levels from PET food contact materials are largely independent from the nature of the packed food which on the other hand simplifies exposure estimations from PET...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{variety of}} melaware {{articles}} {{have been tested}} for migration of melamine into the <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> 3 % w/v acetic acid, as a benchmark, and into other <b>food</b> <b>simulants,</b> beverages and <b>foods</b> for comparison. The {{results indicate that the}} acidity of the <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> plays <b>a</b> role in promoting migration but not by as much as might have been anticipated, since 3 % acetic acid gave migration values about double those obtained using water under the same time and temperature test conditions. In contrast, migration into the fatty <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> olive oil was not detectable and at least 20 -fold lower than with the aqueous <b>food</b> <b>simulants.</b> This was expected given the solubility properties of melamine and the characteristics of the melaware plastic. Migration levels into hot acidic beverages (apple juice, tomato juice, red-fruit tea and black coffee) were rather similar to the acetic acid simulant when the same time and temperature test conditions are used, e. g. 2 hours at 70 °C. However, migration levels into foods that were placed hot into melaware articles and then allowed to cool on standing were much lower (6 to 14 -times lower) than if pre-heated food was placed into the articles and then maintained (artificially) at that high temperature {{in the same way that}} a controlled time-temperature test using simulants would be conducted. This very strong influence of time and especially temperature was manifest in the effects seen of microwave heating of food or beverage in the melaware articles. Here, despite the short duration of hot contact, migration levels were similar to simulants used for longer periods, e. g. 70 °C for 2 hours. This is rationalised in terms of the peak temperature achieved on microwave heating, which may exceed 70 °C, counterbalancing the shorter time period held hot. There was also evidence that when using melaware utensils in boiling liquids, as for stove-top use of spatulas, the boiling action of circulating food/simulant can have an additional effect in promoting surface erosion, increasing the plastic decomposition and so elevating the melamine release...|$|R

Despite losses incurred in the film manufacturing process, and the amount that remained covalently bonded with protein because of cross-linking, the addition of 1. 5, 3, and 5 % of cinnamaldehyde (g/ 100 g protein) to gliadins at pH 2 rendered 1. 8, 4. 8, and 11. 0 mg cinnamaldehyde/g film, respectively, available to be released, and therefore to exert antimicrobial activity.

It is a Proficiency Testing (PT) on <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> E spiked with potential migrant substances carried out by the European Union Reference Laboratory (EURL) for Food Contact Materials (FCM). Regulation (EU) No 10 / 2011 establishes <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> E for testing migration compliance of plastics in contact with dry foodstuffs. The simulant E (Tenax®) was spiked with 7 substances at given concentrations tailored for this exercise, of which 3 were replaced from the previous year. A list containing 10 substances in which 7 were effectively present in the simulant was distributed to the participants. Homogeneity and stability studies were conducted. The main scope of this ILC 01 - 2014 was to evaluate the improvement on the performance of the National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) for specific analysis of potential migrants in Tenax®. The participants should identify and quantify the substances spiked in the <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> by using the analytical method of their choice. The z-score values, for each substance/laboratory, were obtained by the assigned value calculated with the results reported by the participants (robust mean). The participation of the laboratories in this follow-up on identification and quantification of the substances in <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> E was very satisfactory regarding the number of received results as well as the significant improvement in the performance of the NRLs.

40|$|The {{migration}} of antioxidant (AO) agents, carvacrol and thymol, from polypropylene (PP) packaging films containing the studied compounds at 80 g/kg separately and an equimolar mixture {{of them into}} <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> was investigated. Fast and reliable analytical procedures were developed and validated {{for the analysis of}} the studied AOs in <b>food</b> <b>simulants.</b> For aqueous <b>food</b> <b>simulants,</b> solid phase extraction followed by GC–MS analysis was performed. Fatty <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> were directly analysed by GC–MS and HPLC-UV for isooctane and ethanol 950 mL/L, respectively. The release of AOs from the films was dependent on the type of food stimulant and AO incorporated. In particular, high levels of migration were obtained for both AOs into isooctane, showing thymol higher migration. The release kinetics of AOs from PP films showed a Fichian behaviour with diffusion coefficients ranging from 1 to 2 × 10 − 14 m 2 /s; except for the diffusion into isooctane where 4 - 6 higher values were obtained. The antioxidant activity of migration extracts was confirmed by the DPPH method, showing thymol a higher antioxidant capacity especially into isooctane with a 42. 2 % of inhibition. The obtained results suggest that carvacrol and thymol show a potential use as AOs for active packaging for extending the shelf-life of food products.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{high-pressure}} processing on mechanical and thermal properties of four complex packaging materials (polyethylenelethylene vinyl alcohol/ polyethylene: PEIEVOHIPE; metallized polyester/polyethylene: PETmetlPE; polyester/ polyethylene: PETIPE; polypropylene SiOx recovered: PPSiOx) was studied. Pouches {{of the different}} materials containing distilled water or olive oil as <b>food</b> <b>simulants,</b> as well as empty ones, were subjected to 400 MPa for 30 min, at temperatures of 20 or 60 °C. Delamination and wrinkling were a general consequence of the high-pressure processing of multilayer polymeric systems. However, no significant changes were observed regarding the mechanical properties of PE containing laminates after pressurization. PPSiOx underwent significant modifications as SiOx completely broke down. Neither thermal property was affected by pressure, {{as it was the}} processing temperature that induced tempering effects on the crystallization behaviour of polymeric components. Only PE/EVOH/ PE, when in contact with water as <b>a</b> <b>simulant,</b> presented <b>a</b> decrease in the melting point temperature. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{dietary intake}} of harmful elements, {{particularly}} lead and cadmium constitutes a health threat and essential measures should be undertaken to reduce consumer exposure. The latest risk assessments by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) {{have indicated that}} the Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI) for lead and cadmium do not ensure health safety and their review had to be undertaken. Migration from ceramics and glassware intended for food contact is {{an important source of}} lead and cadmium intake. Objectives. To study the release of lead and cadmium from ceramics and glassware (including decorated products) intended for food contact that are available on the Polish market and to assess the resulting health risk to the consumer. Materials and Methods. Ceramics and glassware (mainly decorated) were sampled from the Polish market during 2010 - 2012 throughout the country by staff of the Sanitary-Epidemiological Stations in accordance with monitoring procedures and guidelines designed by the National Institute of Public Health-National Institute of Hygiene. Migration of lead and cadmium was measured by incubating the samples with 4 % acetic acid for 24 hours at a temperature of 22 ± 2 ºC in the dark. Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (FAAS) was used to measure these elements in <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> according to <b>a</b> validated and accredited method (PN-EN ISO/IEC 17025). Results. 1273 samples of ceramics and glass wares were analysed in 2010 - 2012. Lead and cadmium release were usuall...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of two commercial oxygen-scavenging {{products with}} respect to migration of active ingredients into foodstuffs was investigated. Migrants were identified, and by using appropriate analytical methods, migration was determined {{in a variety of}} liquid, solid or gelled <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> and <b>foods.</b> <b>Simulants</b> were chosen to cover a range of water activities and viscosities. Foods and the gelled <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> agar were packed with and without vacuum, and with the oxygen scavenger in various locations relative to the packed food. The main migrants, as identified by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectrometry were Na+ and Cl- in non-acidic aqueous simulants, and Na+, Cl- and Fe 2 + in 3 % acetic acid. Migration into aqueous simulants exceeded the current European Union limit for total migration from plastic materials (assumed to be currently applicable to these systems) and was probably excessive by any reasonable standard. However, neither oxygen scavenger appeared to release significant quantities of migrants into solid foods when the scavenger was properly located in the package and the packing process does not favour the contents becoming wet by water released from the food...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to test three different microwaving packaging materials that {{are the most common}} material in the market, viz. polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), migrated into four <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> solutions. Four different simulant solutions were used based on the food type and FDA recommendations and regulations. These <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> include vegetable pure oil, 3 % (v/v) aqueous acetic acid, 15 % (v/v) ethanol, and olive oil in the temperature of 100 °C. Headspace gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS) was used to determine the relative migration values from packaging materials into food by putting the materials into contact with simulants for 10 days in temperature of 5 °C. The analyzed results show that the migrations of food package are dependent on microwaving time, package material types and simulant types. The polystyrene (PS) caused the fastest relative migration in olive oil while the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has the most relative migration in <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> containing 15 % ethanol. In addition, acetaldehyde, which may be hazardous to consumers, was found in both 3 % aqueous acetic acid and olive oil after 10 minutes microwaving from PET...|$|R
40|$|Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) flakes were ground, contaminated, washed, {{manufactured}} into multilayer preforms and bottles, {{and then}} tested for migration. The model contaminants were toluene, trichloroethane, chlorobenzene, phenyldecane, benzophenone, phenylcyclohexane, and copper(II) acetylacetonate. No migration was detected through a barrier of virgin PET (186 +/- 39 mym) into 3 % acetic acid <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> using general {{methods of testing}} with a detection limit of 1 myg kg- 1. Migration was < 1 myg kg- 1 even for 6 -month-old bottles placed {{in contact with the}} <b>simulant</b> for <b>a</b> further 6 months; that is, a test period considerably in excess of the shelf life of soft drinks. Neither was migration detectable in the more severe simulating solvents (e. g., 50 % aqueous ethanol and 100 % ethanol). Targeted analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy was then used to achieve a sub microgram per kilogram limit of detection and establish the performance of the barrier. Three-layer bottles with the contaminated PET buried were compared with 1 -layer bottles in which contaminated PET contacted the <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> directly. Migration into 3 % acetic acid from 1 -layer bottles was from < 0. 2 up to 0. 4 myg kg- 1, and the worst-case substance was toluene. Therefore, the virgin PET layer reduced migration from an already low level, by more than 2 orders of magnitude...|$|R
40|$|This paper quantitatively {{determined}} the migration level of benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) from paper cups into aqueous <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> or fatty stimulants, under different conditions by second derivative constant-energy synchronous fluorescence spectrometry (DCESFS), which {{proved to be}} a method with high sensitivity and spectral resolution. The influences of <b>food</b> <b>simulants,</b> time and temperature on the relative migration percent(%) of benzo(a) pyrene were discussed. Results showed that the recoveries of this method ranged from 89. 2 % to 104. 3 %. The migration percent(%) of fatty stimulants was higher than that of aqueous simulants. Migration into hot water was also observed, while the migration into cool water was almost negligible. The relative migration percent(%) increased with the increase of time and temperature...|$|R
40|$|Plasticized poly(lactic acid) (PLA) samples with {{embedded}} Cu-doped ZnO powder functionalized with Ag nanoparticles composites {{were prepared}} by melt blending processing technique. The effect of ZnO:Cu/Ag nanoparticles on {{the properties of}} plasticized PLA was investigated in terms of structural (by Attenuated total reflectance – Fourier Transform Infrared – ATR-FT-IR, X–Ray Diffraction analysis – XRD) and morphological (using Scanning Electron Microscopy – SEM and Transmission Electron Microscopy – TEM examination) modifications, thermal (Differential Scanning Calorimetry – DSC), mechanical (transmittance, tensile strength), barrier antimicrobial properties and also in respect to migration of Cu, Zn an Ag nanoparticles into <b>food</b> <b>simulants.</b> It {{was found that the}} increase of nanoparticle content (from 0. 5 to 1. 5 wt%) of PLA formulations leads to the increase of the degree of crystallinity of PLA. The overall migration of all samples into three <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> was below 10 mg·dm– 2, accepted value according to EU Regulation No 10 / 2011 for plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food. Based on the obtained results it can conclude that the optimum composition is PLA/ZnO:Cu/Ag 0. 5, this bionanocomposite offering suitable mechanical and thermal properties, good barrier properties to ultraviolet light, water vapour, oxygen and carbon dioxide, antibacterial activity and low migration amount of nanoparticles into <b>food</b> <b>simulants...</b>|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an inter-laboratory comparison (ILC) on the temperature control during migration tests by article filling organised by the EURL-FCM, Ispra (Italy). Participants carried out a migration test by article filling in provided polypropylene cups (volume 0. 3 L) with <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> D 1 (ethanol 50 %, v/v) at 70 °C for 2 h and monitored the temperature of the <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> inside one of the test specimen during the contact phase and provide details for the operating procedure. The participation to the ILC was satisfactory. The results show that 30 % of the 53 migration experiments performed by the 45 laboratories were successful (scoring 100 %) meaning that the temperature of the <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> was in the desired range during the full contact time. It is clear that this result will trigger further discussion to improve the temperature control during a migration test. The information provided by the laboratories through the questionnaire gives a first insight in the factors that can be important to reach a satisfactory score. This discussion should lead to the selection of one or more methods for temperature control during migration testing. These selected methods need to be compared in a future ILC. JRC.
