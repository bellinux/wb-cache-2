50|$|Socket 604 was {{designed}} by Intel as a zero insertion force socket intended for workstations and server platforms. While the socket contains 604 pins, it only has 603 electrical contacts, the last being a <b>dummy</b> <b>pin.</b> Each contact has a 1.27mm pitch with regular pin array, to mate with a 604-pin processor package.|$|E
40|$|The report {{describes}} the processing and exposure conditions {{required to produce}} good colour radiographs of <b>dummy</b> fuel <b>pins.</b> Using a travelling microscope, cladding tube diameters, fuel pellet diameters and tube/pellet gaps were measured on colour radiographs to an accuracy of better than + 0. 002 inches. The minimum detectable tube/pellet gap was 0. 003 inches. In all cases the colour radiographs proved {{to be as good}} as or better than black and white radiographs of the same object. The se a microdensitometer to measure colour radiographs, it was necessary to print the radiographs on black and white film. A suitable black and white emulsion for this process was established and the results obtained compare favourably with those taken from black and white radiographs. Colour film is more tolerant to gamma radiation than an equivalent black and white x-ray film...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the baby}} {{lifted her head}} and stared at us, {{thrusting}} into her mouth the <b>dummy</b> that was <b>pinned</b> to the breast of her night-gown. The faded pink sleeves of the night-gown were tight on her fat little wrists. She stood thus sucking her dummy, one arm round her father's neck, watching us with hazel solemn eyes. Then she pushed her fat little fist up among the bush of small curls, and began to twist her fingers about her ear that was white like a camelia flower.|$|R
