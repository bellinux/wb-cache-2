50|$|Within the Murmansk block, {{from west}} to east, {{there is an}} {{increase}} in the rare earth elements (REE) content in the initial melts, a change in composition of protoliths from tholeiite with the highest content of REE to subalkaline basalt, and {{in the eastern part of}} the Murmansk block the REE content is even higher. The origin of tonalites and trondhjemites (TT) is most likely the result of partial melting of mafic sources.

40|$|Abstract. – By {{drastically}} {{reducing the}} bulk strength of crustal materials, partial-melting {{is one of}} the main parameter controlling the rheological behaviour of the continental crust. With more than ca. 50 % of the outcropping surface char-acterised by migmatites and granites, the coastal South Armorican domain, offers an opportunity to study deep-orogenic processes and more particularly, to understand the role of partial-melting for the late-evolution of the Variscan belt. To date, time-constraints are scarce hindering the understanding of this crucial stage in the Variscan belt evolution. This pa-per provides 29 new U-Th/Pb chemical ages on monazite collected over five sampling areas consisting in migmatite domes and late regional classic plutons. Based on structural, textural and chemical criteria, three main U-Th/Pb age-groups are distinguished. The first group, settled at ca. 335 - 330 Ma concerns samples of restites and core-domains of the monazite crystals for most of the <b>granite</b> <b>massifs.</b> Its significance is ascribed to inherited crystallisation ages probably recording the crossing of prograde monazite forming reactions (i. e. metamorphic isograds) during increasing P-T conditions in an overall nappe-stacking context. The second group that clusters at ca. 325 - 320 Ma corresponds to newly formed monazite grains that crystallised from juvenile silicate melts. Ages of this group are interpreted as crystallisation ages of leucosomes after a major partial-melting event that affected the whole domain. The last ca. 320 Ma group corresponds to rim-domains of monazite crystals. It is interpreted as the emplacement age of most of the large-scale <b>granite</b> <b>massifs</b> and therefore fixes the end of the partial-melting event...|$|R

The experiment using typical material from the Li-F-P-rich Podlesí granite stock (Krušné hory Mts., Czech Republic) as a starting charge, with added F and P, resulted in discrete microlayering. In the quenched glass, rhythmically alternating thin (5 - 10 µm) bands either enriched or depleted in alumina occurred.
