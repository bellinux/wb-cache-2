25|$|There are {{distinct}} differences between displacement and elution chromatography. In elution mode, substances typically {{emerge from a}} column in narrow, Gaussian peaks. Wide separation of peaks, preferably to baseline, is desired for maximum purification. The speed at which any component of a mixture travels down the column in elution mode depends on many factors. But for two substances to travel at different speeds, and thereby be resolved, there must be substantial differences in some interaction between the biomolecules and the chromatography matrix. Operating parameters are adjusted to maximize {{the effect of this}} difference. In many cases, baseline separation of the peaks can be achieved only with <b>gradient</b> <b>elution</b> and low column loadings. Thus, two drawbacks to elution mode chromatography, especially at the preparative scale, are operational complexity, due to gradient solvent pumping, and low throughput, due to low column loadings. Displacement chromatography has advantages over elution chromatography in that components are resolved into consecutive zones of pure substances rather than “peaks”. Because the process takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the isotherms, a larger column feed can be separated on a given column with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Common {{mobile phases}} used include any {{miscible}} combination {{of water with}} various organic solvents (the most common are acetonitrile and methanol). Some HPLC techniques use water-free mobile phases (see Normal-phase chromatography below). The aqueous component of the mobile phase may contain acids (such as formic, phosphoric or trifluoroacetic acid) or salts {{to assist in the}} separation of the sample components. The composition of the mobile phase may be kept constant ("isocratic elution mode") or varied ("gradient elution mode") during the chromatographic analysis. Isocratic elution is typically effective in the separation of sample components that are very different in their affinity for the stationary phase. In <b>gradient</b> <b>elution</b> the composition of the mobile phase is varied typically from low to high eluting strength. The eluting strength of the mobile phase is reflected by analyte retention times with high eluting strength producing fast elution (=short retention times). A typical gradient profile in reversed phase chromatography might start at 5% acetonitrile (in water or aqueous buffer) and progress linearly to 95% acetonitrile over 5–25 minutes. Periods of constant mobile phase composition may be part of any gradient profile. For example, the mobile phase composition may be kept constant at 5% acetonitrile for 1–3 min, followed by a linear change up to 95% acetonitrile.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Gradient</b> <b>elution</b> {{decreases}} {{the retention of}} the later-eluting components so that they elute faster, giving narrower (and taller) peaks for most components.

This also increases the peak height (the peak looks [...] "sharper"), which is important in trace analysis. The gradient program may include sudden [...] "step" [...] increases {{in the percentage of}} the organic component, or different slopes at different times – all according to the desire for optimum separation in minimum time.|$|E

The aim of this work {{was to develop a}} relatively fast method of the synthesis and storage conditions for the arsenic-glutathione complexes.

The synthesis was carried out in solution of 2 mM TCEP (tris(2 carboxyethyl) phosphine) in water and with excess of the glutathione. Solutions of 20 ppb arsenic-complexes were consecutively measured after 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h and 24 hours of synthesis. The results confirmed stability of the arsenic-complexes in the reaction mixtures over 24 h. The arsenic-glutathione complexes were separated using a reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) coupled with inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

2500|$|RP-HPLC {{operates}} {{on the principle}} of hydrophobic interactions, which originates from the high symmetry in the dipolar water structure and plays the most important role in all processes in life science. RP-HPLC allows the measurement of these interactive forces. The binding of the analyte to the stationary phase is proportional to the contact surface area around the non-polar segment of the analyte molecule upon association with the ligand on the stationary phase. This solvophobic effect is dominated by the force of water for [...] "cavity-reduction" [...] around the analyte and the C18-chain versus the complex of both. The energy released in this process is proportional to the surface tension of the eluent (water: 7.3J/cm², methanol: 2.2J/cm²) and to the hydrophobic surface of the analyte and the ligand respectively. The retention can be decreased by adding a less polar solvent (methanol, acetonitrile) into the mobile phase to reduce the surface tension of water. <b>Gradient</b> <b>elution</b> uses this effect by automatically reducing the polarity and the surface tension of the aqueous mobile phase {{during the course of the}} analysis.|$|E

The use of the online system with step salt elution had the possibility of resulting in peptide overlapping across fractions. The offline mode had the option to operate with continuous salt gradient to decrease peak overlap, but exhibited decreased robustness, lower reproducibility, and sample loss during the process. Due to the extensive washing requirement between the chromatography steps, online continuous gradient {{was not an option}} for salt elution. In this report, a fully auto-mated, online, and continuous gradient (pH continuous online gradient, pCOG) 2 -D LC-MS/MS system is introduced that provided excellent separation and identification power.

Cobalamins were previously preconcentrated in C 18 resins cartridges. Detection was performed using UV-diode array detector {{in a range of}} λ of 200 - 400 nm.

The detection limits ranged between 0. 07 pgmL- 1 for 5 ′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin and 0. 5 pgmL- 1 for hydroxocobalamin. The mean cobalamins recoveries for direct determination ranged between 76 and 93 % for hydroxo-, cyano- and methylcobalamin, while the recovery for 5 ′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin was only 31 % suggesting that the preconcentration method was not valid for this cobalamin.

The generation and characteristics of these <b>gradients</b> for <b>elution</b> after preconcentration have been investigated. The gradients are generated by placing a low-mobility, weak ion-exchange competing anion in the capillary (weak electrolyte, WE), and a high-mobility, strong ion-exchange competing anion in the electrolyte vials (strong electrolyte, SE). Application of voltage establishes a diffuse boundary with the composition changing from the weak anion to the strong anion. Comparison of <b>elution</b> <b>gradients</b> generated with different electrolyte systems was accomplished by comparing the eluotropic strength (a function of eluent concentration, ion-exchange selectivity coefficient, and charge) and the shape of the profile as it changes from WE to SE. The ion-exchange selectivity coefficient of the SE competing anion is important in establishing a sharp change in elution strength. A large difference in mobility between the WE and SE competing anions gives an SE with a higher final eluotropic strength, but the slope of the gradient is shallower. This results in a reduction in the efficiency of analyte focusing. To ensure maximum focusing efficiency, the WE and SE electrolytes should be selected such that the SE has the highest possible eluotropic strength for a given concentration of WE. The SE competing anion should also have a sufficiently low electrophoretic mobility to ensure focusing for the maximum number of analytes, and the mobility difference between the WE and SE competing anions should be as small as possible...|$|R
