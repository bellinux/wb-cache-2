5|$|Musically speaking, Hate {{is notable}} for its stripped-down, {{straightforward}} approach {{and the use}} of a <b>drum</b> <b>machine,</b> the latter sparking some controversy. Lamounier claimed to have no qualms about using this device, on the basis that most death metal drummers use trigger pads for recording purposes, which in the end produces the same homogenized sound as that of a <b>drum</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 808 was {{followed}} in 1983 by the TR-909, the first Roland <b>drum</b> <b>machine</b> to use samples (for its cymbal and hi-hat sounds) alongside analog sounds. In the 1990s, Roland included {{samples of the}} 808 in its successful Groovebox devices. In February 2014, Roland announced the TR-8 <b>drum</b> <b>machine,</b> which recreates the 808 and 909 {{through a combination of}} modeling and sampling. In August 2017, Roland announced the TR-08, a miniaturized 808 reissue with features including an LED display, MIDI and USB connections, expanded sequencer control, and a built-in speaker.|$|E
5|$|After {{the breakup}} of his gothic rock band the Marked, singer and guitarist Billy Corgan left St. Petersburg, Florida, {{to return to his}} native city of Chicago, where he took a job in a record store and formed the idea of a new band to be called the Smashing Pumpkins. While working there, he met guitarist James Iha. Adorning {{themselves}} with paisley and other psychedelic trappings, the two began writing songs together (with the aid of a <b>drum</b> <b>machine)</b> that were heavily influenced by The Cure and New Order. The duo performed live {{for the first time on}} July 9, 1988 at the Polish bar Chicago 21. This performance included only Corgan on bass and Iha on guitar with a <b>drum</b> <b>machine.</b> Shortly thereafter, Corgan met D'arcy Wretzky after a show by the Dan Reed Network where they argued the merits of the band. After finding out Wretzky played bass guitar, Corgan recruited her into the lineup and the now-trio played a show at the Avalon Nightclub. After this show, Cabaret Metro owner Joe Shanahan agreed to book the band on the condition that they replace the <b>drum</b> <b>machine</b> with a live drummer.|$|E

50|$|Akai also {{produced}} several Digital MIDI sequencers and digital synthesizers {{such as the}} MPC range (Music Production Center), a line of integrated <b>drum</b> <b>machines,</b> MIDI sequencers, samplers and direct-to-disk recorders that resemble <b>drum</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>machines</b> {{developed}} {{out of a}} need {{to create}} drum beats when a drum kit was not available. Increasingly, <b>drum</b> <b>machines</b> and <b>drum</b> programming are used by major record labels to undercut the costly expense of studio drummers.|$|R
5|$|The Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, often {{referred}} to as the 808, is a <b>drum</b> <b>machine</b> introduced by the Roland Corporation in 1980 and discontinued in 1983. It was one of the earliest programmable drum machines, with which users could create their own rhythms rather than having to use preset patterns.|$|E
5|$|As {{the entire}} album was {{recorded}} and played by Anderson, {{the only option}} was to record the music in layers. First, he recorded the drums, using a drum kit. However, he was unhappy with the way they sounded, and so re-recorded on a <b>drum</b> <b>machine.</b> The next layers to be recorded were the guitar, bass and vocals, with other sounds being added later.|$|E
5|$|So I {{went out}} and saw the band – Billy, James, and D'arcy – playing at Avalon with a <b>drum</b> <b>machine.</b> Man, did they sound horrible! They were atrocious. But the thing I noticed was that {{not only were the}} song {{structures}} good, but Billy's voice had a lot of drive to it, like he was dying to succeed. So I ended up driving from work every Wednesday to rehearse with them.|$|E
5000|$|Electro-mechanical <b>drum</b> <b>machines</b> {{were first}} {{developed}} in 1949, with {{the invention of}} the Chamberlin Rhythmate. Transistorized electronic <b>drum</b> <b>machines</b> later appeared in the 1960s. The Ace Tone Rhythm Ace, created by Ikutaro Kakehashi, began appearing in popular music from the late 1960s, followed by <b>drum</b> <b>machines</b> from Korg and Ikutaro's later Roland Corporation also appearing in popular music from the early 1970s. Sly and the Family Stone's 1971 album There's a Riot Goin' On helped to popularize the sound of early <b>drum</b> <b>machines,</b> along with Timmy Thomas' 1972 R&B hit [...] "Why Can't We Live Together" [...] and George McCrae's 1974 disco hit [...] "Rock Your Baby" [...] which used early Roland rhythm machines.|$|R

5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Skyline Studios in New York City. Skyline {{was only a}} few blocks away from the Public Access Synthesizer Studio, where the band had recorded their previous albums. Alan Bezozi and John Flansburgh worked together to create atypical drum tracks, including one that samples the sound of Flansburgh's kitchen sink and refrigerator being struck with a drum stick. An Alesis SR-16 <b>drum</b> <b>machine</b> was used to program the drums.|$|E
5|$|Arulpragasam's early {{compositions}} {{relied heavily}} on the Roland MC-505 music sequencer and <b>drum</b> <b>machine.</b> Her later work marked an evolution in her sound with rare instruments, electronics and unusual sound samples. Critics have acclaimed a distinctive style to her music. Lyrically incorporating a range of political, social, philosophical and cultural references that have defied existing pop music conventions, Arulpragasam {{was one of the}} first acts to come to public attention through the internet. She posted many of her songs and videos from 2002 onwards on platforms such as MySpace.|$|E
5|$|As {{the chorus}} progresses, Harket's voice hits ever higher notes, {{reaching}} a falsetto {{and hitting the}} song's highest note (E5, the dominant note) at the end. There is a temporary change of markings in the drum pattern in the chorus, where for two bars the drums play in half time, returning to the same rhythm as before for {{the climax of the}} vocal line. A mix of a <b>drum</b> <b>machine,</b> the LinnDrum, acoustic guitars and electronic instrumentation serves as the song's backing track.|$|E

5|$|Berge and Brundtland were {{introduced}} to each other through a mutual friend in Tromsø, Norway. They enjoyed the same films and music, and shared an interest in electronics. The two experimented with various forms of electronic music, and bought a <b>drum</b> <b>machine</b> together during the Tromsø techno scene before going their separate ways. Several years later, the two met up again and formed Röyksopp during the Bergen Wave. After experimenting with different genres of electronic music, the band solidified {{their place in the}} electronica scene with their 2001 debut album, Melody A.M., released on the Wall of Sound record label.|$|E
5|$|Conceived in {{the wake}} of a series of {{distressing}} personal events, 808s & Heartbreak marked a major musical departure for West from his previous rap records, instead featuring a sparse, electronic sound and West singing through an Auto-Tune vocal processor. His lyrics explored themes of loss, alienated fame, and heartache, while the album's production abandoned conventional hip hop sounds in favor of a minimalist sonic palette, which included prominent use of the titular Roland TR-808 <b>drum</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jarre's 1976 low budget {{solo album}} Oxygène, {{recorded}} {{at his home}} studio, made him internationally famous. It comprises six numbered synthesiser tracks that make strong use of melody, rather than rhythm or dissonance. A Scully eight-track recorder was used to record instruments like the Eminent 310 (with an Electro-Harmonix Small Stone phaser on its string pads) and the Korg Minipops <b>drum</b> <b>machine.</b> Liberal use of echo was used on the various sound effects generated by the VCS3 synthesiser. Jarre's ARP 2600 synthesiser, previously used on his collaborations with Christophe, also featured, as did his EMS VCS 3.|$|E

5|$|The 808 was {{the first}} <b>drum</b> <b>machine</b> {{with the ability to}} program an entire {{percussion}} track from beginning to end, complete with breaks and rolls. It includes volume knobs for each voice, numerous audio outputs, and a DIN sync port (a precursor to MIDI) to synchronize with other devices through the Digital Control Bus interface, which was considered groundbreaking. The machine has three trigger outputs, which can be used to synchronize with synthesizers and other equipment.|$|E
5|$|The T series, {{produced}} from 1968 to 1975, {{was the last}} of the tonewheel spinet organs. Unlike all the earlier Hammond organs, which used vacuum tubes for preamplification, amplification, percussion and chorus-vibrato control, the T series used all-solid-state, transistor circuitry, though, unlike the L-100, it did include the scanner-vibrato as seen on the B-3. Other than the T-100 series models, all other T-Series models included a built-in rotating Leslie speaker and some included an analog <b>drum</b> <b>machine,</b> while the T-500 also included a built-in cassette recorder. It {{was one of the last}} tonewheel Hammonds produced.|$|E
5|$|Like most of McLachlan's albums, Surfacing was {{recorded}} at Marchand's Wild Sky Studios in Morin-Heights, Quebec. Marchand, who produced, engineered and mixed the album, recorded {{it on an}} Otari RADAR recorder and a Neumann 149 microphone. McLachlan played piano, acoustic guitar and electric guitar and Marchand played keyboards, bass and a <b>drum</b> <b>machine</b> {{as well as providing}} background vocals. The other musicians on the album were Jim Creeggan on upright bass, Yves Desrosiers on guitar, musical saw, lap steel guitar and slide bass, Brian Minato on bass and electric guitar, Michel Pepin on electric guitar and Ashwin Sood (whom McLachlan married in 1997) on percussion and drums.|$|E

5|$|Tenebraes {{score is}} very {{different}} to those the band had produced for Argento previously. The early 1980s had seen Simonetti experimenting with dance music, and he decided on a more electronic sound for Tenebrae. Simonetti described the score as an electronica/rock hybrid, with the main theme including disco elements. So {{it would not be}} difficult to accommodate Argento's preference for long takes, Simonetti, Pignatelli and Morante made sure to play each song for 3–4 minutes. Recording the score, Simonetti used the Roland Jupiter-8, Roland Vocoder Plus and Minimoog synthesizers, as well as a piano, electric piano, the Oberheim DMX digital drum, a Roland TR-808 <b>drum</b> <b>machine,</b> and Roland MC-4 music sequencer. Pignatelli played bass and fretless guitar, while Morante played electric and acoustic guitar.|$|E
5|$|The band {{rented a}} house, {{and hoped that}} living communally would foster good {{relations}} and a happier recording environment. According to Corgan, Iha refused {{to live in the}} house and rarely visited. The recording sessions continued to be slow-moving and heavily technical. In the absence of a drummer, the band used a <b>drum</b> <b>machine</b> as it had in its earliest incarnation. The band also enlisted Joey Waronker, of Beck's band, and Matt Cameron, of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, for a few songs each. Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb contributed electronic sequencing and sounds to eight album tracks, with the band giving him mostly free rein.|$|E
5|$|Tony! Toni! Toné! {{tracked the}} final mixes {{of the songs}} at Caribbean Sound Basin. Its main studio used a 64-channel SSL 4064 G mixing console, the {{secondary}} studio used a 48-track Neve console with flying faders, and its third studio used an Amek BC2 console. The group mostly used the older Neve console. In tracking the songs, they started with a <b>drum</b> <b>machine</b> groove as a basic track and recorded it. The parts recorded with live instrumentation were then added to the mix. Live drums and horn sections were included to attain the sound of performing live. Sons of Soul was subsequently mastered by engineer Herb Powers at his New York City studio P.M. Entertainment.|$|E
