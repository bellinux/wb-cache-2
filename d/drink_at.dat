5|$|Sandgrouse are gregarious, feeding in {{flocks of}} up to 100 birds. As a {{consequence}} of their dry diet, they need to visit water sources regularly. Drinking times vary among the species. Ten species <b>drink</b> <b>at</b> dawn, four at dusk and two at indeterminate times. When drinking, water is sucked into the beak which is then raised to let the water flow down into the crop. By repeating this procedure rapidly, enough water to last twenty four hours can be swallowed in a few seconds. As they travel to water holes, they call to {{members of their own}} species and many hundreds or thousands synchronise their arrival at the drinking site despite converging from many different locations scattered over hundreds of square miles (kilometres) of territory.|$|E

5|$|The Daoist {{religious}} {{society of the}} Five Pecks of Rice was initiated by Zhang Daoling in 142 CE. Zhang was raised {{in what is now}} Jiangsu where he studied Daoist beliefs in immortality. He moved to what is now Sichuan province and claimed to have a revelation where the deified Laozi appointed him as his earthly representative and Celestial Master. The movement spread rapidly, particularly under Zhang's sons, Zhang Heng and Zhang Lu. Instead of money, followers were asked to contribute five pecks of rice to the {{religious society}} and banned the worship of 'unclean' gods who accepted sacrificial offerings of meat. Initiated members of the group were called 'libationers', a title associated with village elders who took the first <b>drink</b> <b>at</b> feasts. The laity were told that if they obeyed the rules of the religious society, they would be rewarded with good health. Illness was thus seen as the result of violating religious rules and committing personal sins, which required confession to libationers charged with overseeing the recovery of sinners. They believed that chanting parts of the Daodejing would bring about cures for illnesses. Zhang Daoling's second successor Zhang Lu initiated a rebellion in 184 CE that allowed him to retain complete control over Ba and Hanzhong commanderies (of modern Sichuan and southern Shanxi) for three decades. He even modelled his 'charity houses' after Han postal stations, yet his establishments offered grain and meat to followers. Although Zhang Lu surrendered to Chancellor Cao Cao (155220 CE) in 215 CE, Cao was still wary of his influence over the people, so he granted Zhang and his sons fiefs to placate them.|$|E
