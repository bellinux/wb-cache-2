5|$|Noether spoke quickly—reflecting {{the speed}} of her thoughts, many said—and demanded great {{concentration}} from her students. Students who disliked <b>her</b> <b>style</b> often felt alienated. Some pupils felt that she relied too much on spontaneous discussions. Her most dedicated students, however, relished the enthusiasm with which she approached mathematics, especially since her lectures often built on earlier work they had done together.|$|E
5|$|Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) informs Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) {{that she}} can no longer dress as a goth, alarmed by a spate of pseudo-vampirism in the school, {{inspired}} by the Twilight series. She briefly changes <b>her</b> <b>style,</b> before dressing as a vampire and convincing Figgins {{that if he does}} not allow her to wear her preferred clothes, her vicious Asian vampire father will bite him.|$|E
5|$|As Heyer's {{popularity}} increased, {{other authors}} began to imitate <b>her</b> <b>style.</b> In May 1950, {{one of her}} readers notified her that Barbara Cartland had written several novels in a style similar to Heyer's, reusing names, character traits and plot points and paraphrased descriptions from her books, particularly A Hazard of Hearts, which borrowed characters from Friday's Child, and The Knave of Hearts which took off These Old Shades. Heyer completed {{a detailed analysis of}} the alleged plagiarisms for her solicitors, and while the case never came to court and no apology was received, the copying ceased. Her lawyers suggested that she leak the copying to the press. Heyer refused.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{rising to}} fame in 2004 as a finalist {{on the third}} season of American Idol, Leah LaBelle {{released}} covers of songs through her YouTube account, and found minor success. American record producer Pharrell Williams, discovered LaBelle through her videos, and called So So Def Recording's founder and CEO Jermaine Dupri for his opinion of her. In 2011, LaBelle was signed to a joint record deal with L.A. Reid's company Epic Records, Dupri's So So Def Recordings, and Williams' label I Am Other. She said that Williams and Dupri were drawn to <b>her</b> <b>style</b> of performing.|$|E
5|$|The five {{previous}} {{series of}} One Foot in the Grave were produced {{and directed by}} Susan Belbin. She had retired because of ill health. Renwick persuaded her {{to return to work}} on the final series to provide continuity, but her health quickly forced her to resign from the show again. The final series was produced by Jonathon P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience working with Belbin on the earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as on other shows, meant that <b>her</b> <b>style</b> was similar to Belbin's, which would aid the transition between directors.|$|E
5|$|At Velfarre, she was {{introduced}} to her future producer, Max Matsuura, through a friend. After hearing Hamasaki sing karaoke, Matsuura offered her a recording deal, but Hamasaki suspected ulterior motives and turned the offer down. He persisted and succeeded in recruiting her for the Avex label in the following year. Hamasaki started vocal training, but skipped most of her classes after finding her instructors to be too rigid and the classes dull. When she confessed this to Matsuura, he sent her to New York to train her vocals under another method. During her foreign sojourn, Hamasaki frequently corresponded with Matsuura and impressed him with <b>her</b> <b>style</b> of writing. On her return to Japan, he suggested that she try writing her own lyrics.|$|E

50|$|Throughout {{those years}} she would live a {{parallel}} {{life as a}} professional stylist and part-time photographer. She said it was, “like having a husband and a lover.”In 2003, she eventually chose photography over <b>her</b> <b>styling</b> career.|$|R
5|$|Her {{family had}} been {{relatively}} obscure until 1852, when her father, Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, was chosen {{with the consent of}} the great powers to succeed his distant cousin, Frederick VII, to the Danish throne. At the age of sixteen, she was chosen as the future wife of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, the heir apparent of Queen Victoria. They married eighteen months later in 1863, the same year her father became king of Denmark as Christian IX and her brother was appointed to the vacant Greek throne as George I. She was Princess of Wales from 1863 to 1901, the longest anyone has ever held that title, and became generally popular; <b>her</b> <b>style</b> of dress and bearing were copied by fashion-conscious women. Largely excluded from wielding any political power, she unsuccessfully attempted to sway the opinion of British ministers and her husband's family to favour Greek and Danish interests. Her public duties were restricted to uncontroversial involvement in charitable work.|$|E
5|$|Madonna's {{look and}} style of dressing, her performances, and her music videos {{influenced}} young girls and women. <b>Her</b> <b>style</b> {{became one of the}} female fashion trends of the 1980s. Created by stylist and jewelry designer Maripol, the look consisted of lace tops, skirts over capri pants, fishnet stockings, jewelry bearing the crucifix, bracelets, and bleached hair. Madonna's popularity continued to rise globally with the release of her second studio album, Like a Virgin, in November 1984. It became her first number-one album in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, the UK, and the US. Like a Virgin was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America and sold more than 21 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Nina Tucker is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Delta Goodrem. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 11 June 2002. Goodrem {{was approached by}} producers after they saw her video for her debut single. Goodrem, who had just signed a record deal, almost turned down the role of Nina as she felt the character did not suit <b>her</b> <b>style</b> of music. The role was rewritten for her and she joined the cast. A year later, {{she was diagnosed with}} Hodgkin's lymphoma and had to leave the show for treatment. Once her health improved, she made a return to Neighbours in 2004 to tie up Nina's storylines. In 2005, Neighbours celebrated its 20th anniversary with an episode that featured many ex-cast members, in which Goodrem reprised her role as Nina once more. She returned again in March 2015 for the show's 30th anniversary.|$|E
50|$|<b>Her</b> {{signature}} <b>style</b> {{has historically}} been black or boldly colored—with the cut of the clothes most important. Her main concern has always been proportions, curves and necklines. Her designs {{are known to be}} sexy, yet classic. She is a self-identified fabric junkie credited with popularizing many futuristic fabrics. <b>Her</b> <b>styles</b> range from body-conscious cocktail dresses, to wedding attire, to lounge wear, but she is best known for her form-flattering dresses and garish men's neckties.|$|R

5|$|Rix Nicholas {{continued}} to experience success in her exhibitions and with regular favourable reviews in the press, such {{as for her}} show in the Queen Victoria Markets in September 1920. Nevertheless, Pigot has argued that {{her place in the}} Australian art world at the time was complex, and <b>her</b> <b>style</b> was affected by vigorous debate around the emergence of modernism, which was being resisted by local critics. Her experience of this more conservative Australia, and the effects of the deaths of all those close to her, contributed to Rix Nicholas abandoning her more experimental art, and returning to more academic and figurative subjects. This ultimately had a detrimental effect on the long-term trajectory of her career. Pigot also argues that her refusal to conform to the gendered expectations of the Australian artistic establishment led to her rejection.|$|E
25|$|Not {{even the}} artistic director, Brigitte Lefèvre, {{could explain why}} the jury {{consistently}} didn’t vote for her. Some ventured that <b>her</b> <b>style</b> was too extroverted and virtuosic for Paris, where restraint and purity are valued.|$|E
25|$|Although {{she became}} known first and {{foremost}} as an author, Tove Jansson considered her careers as author and painter to be of equal importance. She painted her whole life, changing style from the classical impressionism of her youth to the highly abstract modernist style of her later years. Jansson displayed a number of artworks in exhibitions during the 1930s and early 1940s, and her first solo exhibition was held in 1943. Despite generally positive reviews, criticism induced Jansson to refine <b>her</b> <b>style</b> such that in her 1955 solo exhibition <b>her</b> <b>style</b> had become less overloaded in terms of detail and content. Between 1960 and 1970 Jansson held five more solo exhibitions.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with VEVO stylized, Lee showcased and explained <b>her</b> fashion <b>style,</b> commenting that she would rather make her own clothes because {{it is hard to}} find what she exactly wants elsewhere. In {{an interview}} with AOL, Lee stated that <b>her</b> daily <b>style</b> is very different from when she performs; pointing out that she was wearing [...] "something floral" [...] during the interview. She explained that her on-stage wardrobe was meant to preserve the atmosphere of the songs and complete the image. In another interview, she stated that when the band first started performing, she would wear corsets to avoid diluting the band's public image, but has gradually become more comfortable with <b>her</b> own <b>style.</b> <b>Her</b> current on-stage <b>style</b> is often characterized by boots, a simple black tank top, a long skirt and various ornaments and accessories.|$|R

25|$|Due to {{her late}} start from age 58 and her {{relatively}} early death 11 years later, Masters' published output is small but her impact was disproportionate in that <b>her</b> <b>style</b> and writings about writing inspired many others {{to take up}} the craft.|$|E
25|$|With <b>her</b> <b>style</b> of Princess Royal, Victoria {{was granted}} {{use of the}} royal arms, as then used: with an {{escutcheon}} of the shield of Saxony, the whole differenced by a label argent of three points, the outer points bearing crosses gules, the central a rose gules.|$|E

50|$|Nakamura {{is notable}} {{for the two}} {{different}} styles in which she sings. <b>Her</b> first <b>style</b> is a modern rock/pop sound. <b>Her</b> second <b>style</b> is an enka-inspired sound; thus far her enka-styled ballads have been her largest successes. Her singles have thus far alternated between these two styles.|$|R
