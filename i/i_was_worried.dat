25|$|What really invigorates this novel, though, {{is the way}} it {{alternates}} between Claire's chapters and chapters {{narrated by}} Lola, her 50-year-old Filipino nanny. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> early on that Lola would be a Southeast Asian version of the Magical Negro, who exists merely to help some self-absorbed white person reach enlightenment. But she's entirely her own wonderful, troubled character, and her relationship with Claire remains complex and unresolved.|$|E
25|$|Discussions about Fahrenheit 451 often {{center on}} its story {{foremost}} {{as a warning}} against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, {{he was concerned about}} censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I wrote this book at a time when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E
500|$|In the 1996 musical, Evita, Madonna {{played the}} title role of Eva Perón. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Perón and wrote to {{director}} Alan Parker to explain why she would be perfect for the part. She said later, [...] "This is the role I was born to play. I put everything of me into this because {{it was much more}} than a role in a movie. It was exhilarating and intimidating at the same time. And I am prouder of Evita than anything else I have done." [...] After securing the role, she had vocal training and learned about the history of Argentina and Perón. During shooting she became ill several times due to the intense emotional effort required. However, as she told Oprah Winfrey, she was also pregnant during the filming: [...] "I was winded after every take. I had to lie on the couch every ten minutes so I could recover from dizzy spells, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> that I was shaking the baby around too much and that would injure it in some way." [...] Madonna wrote in her personal diary at the time: [...] "Ironically, this feeling of vulnerability and weakness is helping me in the movie. I'm sure Evita felt this way every day of her life once she discovered she was ill." ...|$|E

500|$|Sharp was a jockey from 2004 to 2005, riding {{mostly at}} Canterbury Downs in Minnesota, {{but also in}} West Virginia and Maryland. Sharp was an {{assistant}} trainer to Mike Stidham for four years, and then for three years an assistant to Mike Maker, where he ran Maker's operations in New York, Kentucky and New Orleans. Napravnik and Sharp sometimes competed against each other when a horse Sharp trained was running against one Napravnik was riding, but the two were a trainer-rider team for Ramsey's three-year-old colt, Vicar's In Trouble, who won the Louisiana Derby and contested the 2014 Kentucky Derby. [...] In August 2014, Sharp left Maker's barn to begin an independent horse training stable, with {{the full support of}} both Maker and Napravnik. He scored his first graded stakes win on May 16, 2015 on the Preakness undercard with the Ramsey's horse Sandbar in the Grade III Maryland Sprint Handicap. In 2017, Sharp won the Louisiana Derby with Girvin, a colt who was Sharp's first starter in the 2017 Kentucky Derby. [...] Napravnik was the exercise rider for the colt at Sharp's training stable, and commented, [...] "I thought about putting out something on Twitter [...] [...] [...] saying I was going to ride Girvin, as an April Fool’s joke, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> people might take it seriously." ...|$|E

You'll look beautiful. We have a very limited budget but honest, you'll be proud.' And it was bad, very bad. At least that was what I was told.

2500|$|The lead {{scientist}} for Project Monarch. Watanabe was initially skeptical {{about a new}} Hollywood Godzilla film but changed his mind after a meeting with Edwards, stating, [...] "If you are telling the Godzilla story, you cannot separate it from the nuclear element, {{and the first thing}} I asked was whether {{there was going to be}} the nuclear element, as that now, in Japan, is a really sensitive problem. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> about how I could use that and how I could make that okay, but Gareth understood those feelings."

After Zhou Jun died, Quan Cong requested for Sun Quan to commission Zhou Jun's son, Zhou Hu (周護), as a military officer but Sun declined. Sun Quan replied, [...] "In the past, we managed to defeat Cao Cao and obtain Jing Province because of Gongjin's efforts. I've never forgotten his contributions.

I'm afraid I can neither spread Wu's fame as well as Zhang Zhao did, nor make decisions as well as Zichan. However, Zhuge Liang is wise, discerning and good in long-term planning, so I believe he will definitely understand your intentions and the reasons behind your dealings with Wei. With the blessing of the imperial court, I believe it won't be difficult to understand what Zhuge Liang is looking out for. There is nothing to worry about." ...|$|E

But we're dealing with serious issues here; we need solutions, which I offer almost every night. I don't want ad hominem attacks. Take The New York Times columnist Frank Rich and Jon Stewart; I criticize Obama, so both of them seize on the urban legend that I recommended Bear Stearns the week before it collapsed, when I simply told an e-mailer that the deposit in his account at Bear Stearns was safe. 'Your money is safe in Bear Stearns,'" [...] Cramer repeated, referring to his own quote during a March 11, 2008 segment of Mad Money. Moreover, Cramer outlined, [...] "But through a clever sound bite, Stewart, and subsequently Rich—neither of whom have bothered {{to listen to the}} context of the pulled quote—pass off the notion of account safety as an out-and-out buy recommendation. If you called Mad Money and asked me about Citigroup, I would tell you that the common stock might be worthless, but I would never tell you to pull your money out of the bank because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> about its solvency.

2500|$|In 1985, Lim {{tried his}} hand at {{directing}} with David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross, retitled Paradise Heights, for the Drama Festival. The Straits Times Rebecca Chua found that Lim's debut as director [...] "displayed some uncertainty". In the same year, Lim resigned from The Straits Times to set up TheatreWorks in February. TheatreWorks, the first adult professional theatre company in Singapore, was formed to [...] "promote theatre that is relevant to Singaporeans" [...] and create work for English-language actors. Lim served as the company's press and media relations consultant, in addition to acting in several of their plays. Lim also acted in the English-language versions of Kuo Pao Kun's influential plays The Coffin is Too Big for the Hole (1985) and No Parking on Odd Days (1986). Both productions travelled to the Hong Kong Arts Festival in 1987. Of the role he originated in The Coffin is Too Big for the Hole, Lim remembers: [...] "For me, [...] was panic stations. I had never done a long monologue. In drama school, we had to prepare monologues based on a Shakespearean character. Nothing like this, which was 30 to 35 minutes long. And [...] spent {{at least a couple}} of weeks just talking to me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>worried.</b> Because I thought, when is he going to get down to it?" [...] In preparation, Kuo and Lim visited a coffin-maker and discussed the nature of funerals while Lim memorised the script.|$|E
2500|$|Denisof {{had earlier}} {{stated that he}} thought [...] "it's better for the father [...] {{to be kept in}} the {{background}} and not become part of the story." [...] When Wesley's father finally did appear in Angel season five, he said:I had mixed feelings [...] It was {{a lot of pressure to}} have to define something that had been speculated about for many years. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> that by making it specific, it would lose its power, both in the mind of the character and in the minds of the audience. All my concerns disappeared as soon as I read it. There are responses to powerful figures in your life, like your parents, that you can't necessarily control. Wesley's a very controlled person on the exterior and presents a very collected persona to the people around him, being with his father he would no longer be able to control his responses. That's one of the things I wanted to explore with this, the subtle ways in which you respond to the conditioning of your parents. Wesley has difficulty around his father on a physical level, on an emotional scale, and on an intellectual scale. He is extremely intimidated by his father, and at the same time, still seeking the approval that we all essentially want from our parents when we're children. The shooting [...] was an exhilarating moment in which there was the most dangerous person in his life on every level, and there is a woman he is obsessed with. And to have the woman jeopardized by something as dangerous as his father [...] I played that moment as a moment of pure instinct. Wesley is centered in his intellect and is more uncertain in his emotional life, but in that moment, he becomes pure instinct because he has to choose between the woman he loves and his father.|$|E
