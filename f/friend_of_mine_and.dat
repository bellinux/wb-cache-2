25|$|Menzies {{heard of}} Chifley's demise while {{attending}} a parliamentary ball at King's Hall in Parliament House {{to celebrate the}} 50th Jubilee of Federation (Chifley was invited but had declined to attend). Menzies was deeply distressed and abandoned his normally impassive demeanour to announce in a halting subdued voice:It is my very sorrowful duty during this celebration tonight {{to tell you that}} Mr Chifley has died. I don't want to try to talk about him now because, although we were political opponents, he was a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>and</b> yours, and a fine Australian. You will all agree that in the circumstances the festivities should end. It doesn't matter about party politics on an occasion such as this. Oddly enough, in Parliament we get on very well. We sometimes find we have the warmest friendships among people whose politics are not ours. Mr Chifley served this country magnificently for years.|$|E
500|$|In a 2015 {{interview}} with The Pitchfork Review, Björk expressed frustration {{over to the}} lack of recognition for all of her work on Vespertine and her other albums. She said:I did 80% of the beats on Vespertine and it took me three years to work on that album, because it was all microbeats — it was like doing a huge embroidery piece. Matmos came {{in the last two weeks}} and added percussion on top of the songs, but they didn't do any of the main parts, and they are credited everywhere as having done the whole album. [...] Drew [...] is a close <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> in every single interview he did, he corrected it. And they don't even listen to him. It really is strange.|$|E
500|$|Several {{artists have}} remixed or made a {{freestyle}} over the beat, including Eminem, B.o.B, Sean Kingston, Royce da 5'9", Trey Songz, Fat Joe, Teairra Marí, and Diggy Simmons. Simmons, {{the first to}} release a freestyle over the track told Vibe, “With that freestyle, I heard the track, loved it, then got the instrumental from a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>and</b> just did it on the whim. It wasn’t really anything I planned. I wasn’t even ready {{for this to be}} a big thing because I’ve had tracks out before. I put my all into everything, but sometimes some tracks come out better than others. It got such a big buzz maybe because it came out the day after and people enjoyed it.” ...|$|E
25|$|It {{happened}} to some old <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> it's a story I'll never forget.|$|R
6000|$|... "Illustrious lady," [...] said he, [...] "if {{these two}} <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>and</b> I find favour with you, {{here is an}} escort ready found. We are stout fellows, and very faithful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These men are all <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> members <b>of</b> the House," [...] he said, [...] "and there's {{more would}} have come if they'd had a longer notice. Allow me to make you acquainted with Mr. Widgeon of Hull." ...|$|R
500|$|Upon {{the release}} of [...] "Roar", many accused Perry of copying Sara Bareilles' [...] "Brave". When Bareilles herself {{was asked about the}} {{controversy}} between the two songs, she responded: [...] "Katy's a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>and</b> we've known each other a really long time", and was upset that there was a [...] "negative spin on two artists that are choosing to share positive messages." [...] She also mentioned she had known about [...] "Roar" [...] before its release and stated [...] "If I'm not mad I don't know why anybody else is upset". In response to the accusations, Dr. Luke tweeted on August 14, 2013: [...] "Roar was written and recorded before Brave came out." [...] In direct response to the attention [...] "Brave" [...] received {{as a result of the}} plagiarism accusations, Bareilles' record label, Epic Records, decided to promote [...] "Brave" [...] to the mainstream pop radio format.|$|E
500|$|Breakaways {{critical}} acclaim also enabled Clarkson to also earn critical respect, {{particularly from the}} rock and indie music scene, who had looked down upon American Idol contestants. In his memoir, Davis recalled a meeting with Simon Fuller and Sony BMG President Charles Goldstuck, where Fuller acknowledged how the worldwide success of Breakaway had validated American Idol itself. The popularity of [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] among the rock community also resulted in various cover versions by rock acts, such as A Day to Remember, Ted Leo, and Tokyo Police Club. Clarkson herself recalled, [...] "It's ridiculous how well that song was received by hard rockers, by indie people. I was walking around with a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>and</b> this hard-rock guy {{came up to me}} and was like, 'I look stupid, but I tell my friends I love this song.' People at concerts are like, 'That's my guilty pleasure. I don't mean to be mean, but I didn't want to like the American Idol girl.' But they love that song, and it kind of won them over." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{confirming}} that Klein was directing her video, Gaga {{explained that she}} [...] "doesn't know what [...] {{going to look like}} until it's finished", and commented that [...] " [...] a very good <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>and</b> I love him so much, [...] I have so much respect for him. And we've been excited to collaborate and have a fashion photographer tell us a story, the story of my music through his lens and this idea of fashion and lifestyle." [...] Gaga explained that Klein understood her [...] "I am what I wear" [...] lifestyle, making him a suitable director for the video. She added, [...] "It's all about where I'm from and love of theater and love of music and love of the lie in art, and Steven really knows and understands that, [...] So we're making a beautiful video, and I'm so excited." [...] In May 2010, Gaga told The Times about the concept of the video: [...] " [...] purity of my friendships with my gay friends, and how I've been unable to find that with a straight man in my life. It's a celebration and an admiration of gay love—it confesses my envy of the courage and bravery they require to be together. In the video I'm pining for the love of my gay friends—but they just don't want me to be with them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon this weakness, Sir Priest," [...] {{said the}} cavalier, apologetically; [...] "but these worthy gentlemen were ancient <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> have done me many a {{delicate}} service,--much more, perchance, than these poor sables may signify," [...] he added, with a grim gesture toward the mourning suit he wore.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why I'm {{willing to}} help?" [...] Harding {{finished}} for him. [...] "Well, one's motives aren't always very plain, even to oneself. Still--you {{can take it}} that I've a pretty strong grievance against all mortgage brokers. They've ruined one or two <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> they're going to make trouble in this country. I'll give you a few instances." ...|$|R
60|$|To my joy, when we {{had made}} our final reverences, he never came near me again all the evening. I found myself among some young maidens who were <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> in our eager talk {{together}} I began to forget what had passed, or to hope it was only some teasing pastime of the Prince and Eustace.|$|R
2500|$|... 'I {{was nervous}} to review it, {{in case it}} was bad. Dave Ulliot is a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine.</b> <b>And</b> he has a gun. But I needn't have worried. The book is, like the man, fast, funny, scary, smart, cocky, colourful, and I adore them both.' ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{went there}} for the trial and I'd go into {{restaurants}} with Park and people would get up and leave. I called the defense lawyer, {{who happened to be}} a pretty good <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "What do you think a Monroe, Louisiana, jury is going to think of Tongsun Park?" [...] He said, I don't know. I was taken aback. What do you mean you don't know? You've tried a million cases here. [...] "I don't think they've ever seen a Korean before," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|Haggard's {{immediate}} response was denial. He told a Denver television station, [...] "I {{did not have}} a homosexual relationship with a man in Denver... I am steady with my wife. I'm faithful to my wife." [...] Haggard also said, [...] "I have never done drugsever. Not even in high school. I didn't smoke pot. I didn't do anything like that. I'm not a drug man. We're not a drinking family. I don't smoke cigarettes. I don't socially drink. We don't socially drink. We don't have wine in our house. We don't do that kind of thing." [...] Many evangelical leaders initially showed support for Haggard and were critical of media reports, including James Dobson who issued a statement of support for Haggard, which stated: [...] "It is unconscionable that the legitimate news media would report a rumor like this based on nothing but one man's accusation.... Ted Haggard is a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> it appears someone is trying to damage his reputation as a way of influencing the outcome of Tuesday's election [...] especially the vote on Colorado's marriage-protection amendment, which Ted strongly supports." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One is Mr. Harris, of Bermondsey, and {{the other}} is Mr. Price, of this town," [...] said our clerk, glibly. [...] "They are <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>and</b> gentlemen <b>of</b> experience, but they have been out of a place for some little time, and they hoped that perhaps you might find an opening for them in the company's employment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm afraid I can't {{encourage}} you. There's {{three good}} stores here, and the proprietors of all <b>of</b> them are <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> I'm afraid I couldn't {{do a thing}} about introducing you. In fact, I'd feel like a traitor to them if I was responsible for any competition with them. So-- But some time, perhaps, we can have Lulu and Harry here for a visit." ...|$|R
60|$|Isaac. A <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> ma'am, <b>and</b> a trusty friend--let {{him come}} in--[Exit MAID.] He's {{one to be}} {{depended}} on, ma'am.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Somerset {{coming after}} all!' he replied. 'By God! that little six-barrelled <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> a good resolution, {{and he would}} never arrive!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Think of Pedro Johnson,' says Luke, 'a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>and</b> yours {{shot down}} by one of these gilded abolitionists at his very door!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your most obedient, Sir,' {{said the}} Major. 'Damme, Sir, {{a friend of}} my friend Dombey's is a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> I'm glad to see you!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “They are not <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> I have a {{good deal}} to lose,” he said. “What I want to know is, if you had money to spare would you buy the San Cristoval hacienda? There should be a profit in it at the price, but not if the patriots are likely to burn the sugar mill, or the {{administration}} to quarter troops there. You are responsible for this district!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Courage," [...] he said, [...] "this is {{a little}} private {{gathering}} between these <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>and</b> myself, to discuss a private matter {{in which we are}} all much interested. Under these circumstances, I trust that you will not think it discourteous if I ask you to withdraw. Your presence might very possibly tend to check free discussion, and, I might add, would be a source of embarrassment to myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{your own}} sake," [...] he continued, [...] "there are certain facts in {{connection}} with this matter which I must withhold. All I can tell you is this. There are people who have acquired a hold upon Lucille so great that she is forced to obey their bidding. Lady Carey is one, the Duchess of Dorset is another. They are no <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> apparently Lucille has been taken away from me by them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a {{confidential}} assistant of Mr. Thurston's? He {{is an old}} <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> knowing his energy, I dare say he works you very hard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely he {{also will}} be honoured," [...] exclaimed the old fellow with a cackle. [...] "He's a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>and</b> I will tell him the jest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fortunately {{they never}} laid hands on me. A sheik {{of one of}} the Arab tribes was a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> I have been staying with him ever since." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{doctor says}} {{you may go}} down to the Soldiers' Institute that has {{recently}} been set up here, and stay for some time to recruit. It is not intended for invalids, you know, but the ladies in charge are intimate <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> have agreed to let you have a room. The Institute stands on a very pleasant part of the shore, exposed to the fresh sea-breezes; {{and there are lots of}} books and newspapers and games, as well as lectures, concerts, prayer-meetings, Bible-readings, and--" ...|$|R
60|$|There {{were three}} {{of us in the}} smoke-room of the Alexandra--a very good <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> myself, <b>and,</b> in the {{opposite}} corner, a shy-looking, unobtrusive man, the editor, as we subsequently learned, of a New York Sunday paper.|$|R
6000|$|... "You fellows {{have seen}} all, {{so there is}} no need for talk and explanations. One thing I beg of you, if you are any <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> it is that you will not reproach or even speak of Maqueda to me. Doubtless she had reasons for what she did; moreover, her {{bringing}} up has not been the same as ours, and her code is different. Do not let us judge her. I have been a great fool, that is all, and now I am paying for my folly, or, rather, I have paid. Come, let us have some dinner, for we don't know when we shall get another meal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now stop it, Tom, can't you!" [...] pleaded poor Songbird, growing decidedly {{red in the}} face. [...] "Miss Sanderson is only a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> {{you know}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Prescott said thoughtfully, [...] "I don't believe he's here; {{but he was}} a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> I'm as {{anxious to}} have the {{question}} answered as you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And supposing," [...] Macheson said, [...] "that I were to {{tell you}} that this lady is a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> that I will not have you intrude upon her--what then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Curson {{shrugged his}} shoulders. [...] "Yeth. Of courth you never {{expected}} to thee me again, and leatht of all HERE. I'll admit that; I'll thay I wouldn't if I'd been in your plathe. I'll go further, and thay you didn't want to thee me again--anywhere. But it all cometh to the thame thing; here I am. I read the letter you wrote Doloreth. I read how you were hiding here, under Dunn'th very nothe, with his whole pothe out, cavorting round and barkin' up the wrong tree. I {{made up my mind}} to come down here with a few nathty <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>and</b> cut you out under Dunn'th nothe, and run you over into Yuba--that'th all." ...|$|R
60|$|At Reading lock {{we came up}} with a steam launch, {{belonging}} to some <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>and</b> they towed us up to within about a mile of Streatley. It is very delightful being towed up by a launch. I prefer it myself to rowing. The run would have been more delightful still, {{if it had not been}} for a lot of wretched small boats that were continually getting in the way of our launch, and, to avoid running down which, we had to be continually easing and stopping. It is really most annoying, the manner in which these rowing boats get in the way of one’s launch up the river; something ought to done to stop it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I drove over," [...] {{replied the}} son; [...] "I <b>and</b> a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> drove tandem, <b>and</b> I'll bet {{we got here}} sooner than {{we should have done}} by the branch." ...|$|R
