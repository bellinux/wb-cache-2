5|$|The crucial factor which {{frustrated}} firefighting efforts was the narrowness of the streets. Even {{under normal}} circumstances, {{the mix of}} carts, wagons, and pedestrians in the undersized alleys was subject to frequent traffic jams and <b>gridlock.</b> During the fire, the passages were additionally blocked by refugees camping in them amongst their rescued belongings, or escaping outwards, away from the centre of destruction, as demolition teams and fire engine crews struggled in vain to move in towards it.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{called a}} special session in March 1897 to resume the balloting for senator. He {{appointed}} Andrew T. Wood to fill the vacancy in case the legislators did not elect a senator {{in time for the}} congressional session to begin. The Republicans continued supporting Hunter, Free Silver Democrats still backed Blackburn, and Gold Democrats nominated businessman Henry L. Martin of Woodford County. When continued deadlock between Hunter and Blackburn ensued, Hunter withdrew his name from consideration. Republicans nominated St. John Boyle, but the <b>gridlock</b> continued unabated. After several ballots, Boyle also withdrew, and Republicans put forth lawyer and State senator William Joseph Deboe in his place. Deboe was elected on the 112th ballot, becoming the first Republican senator from the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, traffic {{congestion}} {{on the bridge}} had become a serious problem. A 1978 study revealed that although the bridge could handle a peak 1,600 vehicles passing over the bridge per hour, excess traffic pushing it towards its theoretical capacity of 1,920 vehicles per hour could potentially cause <b>gridlock</b> on the bridge. The United States Senate report accompanying the fiscal 1983 appropriation bill for the United States Department of Transportation mentioned that its replacement had become a high priority. A proposed schedule was for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to receive plans for a cable stayed superstructure by February 1, 1983, and for the project {{to be approved by}} mid-April 1983.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{men have}} {{resigned}} {{the office of}} governor {{before the end of}} their terms—John J. Crittenden, Beriah Magoffin, John W. Stevenson, Augustus O. Stanley, Happy Chandler, Earle C. Clements, and Wendell H. Ford. Six resigned to accept a higher office: Crittenden was appointed Attorney General of the United States and the other five were elected to the U.S. Senate. Only Beriah Magoffin resigned under duress. A Confederate sympathizer during the Civil War, Magoffin's power was entirely checked by a hostile, pro-Union legislature. With the state's government in <b>gridlock,</b> Magoffin agreed to resign in exchange for being able to name his successor. Lieutenant Governor Linn Boyd had died in office, and the Speaker of the Senate, John F. Fisk, was not acceptable to Magoffin as a successor. Fisk resigned as Speaker, and the Senate elected Magoffin's choice, James Fisher Robinson as Speaker. Magoffin then resigned, Robinson was elevated to governor, and Fisk was re-elected as Speaker of the Senate.|$|E

The installation at Phrom Phrong Station caused a software problem and a six-hour shutdown of all BTS services on 24 December 2013, leading to <b>gridlock</b> in the city.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, {{businesses}} and residents became more concerned at the downturn of Fitzroy and Carlisle Streets because of crime, violence, haphazard development and traffic <b>gridlock.</b> Similar concerns were also raised by Michael Danby, {{member of the}} House of Representatives for Melbourne Ports, and others about high rents for shops and the increasing shop vacancy rates, lack of car parking and the raised tram tracks that cut Fitzroy Street in half.|$|E

25|$|In December 1968, the NCPC {{released}} a study showing that {{construction of the}} bridge and highways would flood downtown D.C. with so many cars that <b>gridlock</b> would occur. The NCPC voted to remove the Three Sisters Bridge from its regional transportation plan, the D.C. city commission voted to accept the revised NCPC plan days later, and in January 1969 the outgoing Johnson administration deleted plans for the bridge from its highway plan.|$|E
25|$|Rochester's {{expressway}} system, {{conceived in}} the 1950s, {{was designed as}} two concentric circles with feeder expressways from the west, south and east. The system allows for quick travel within the metropolitan area {{and a lack of}} the traffic <b>gridlock</b> typically found in cities of comparable size; in part this is because the system was designed to accommodate an anticipated year-2000 metro population of 5 million, whereas the present-day population is just over one million.|$|E

Nearly all major city downtowns (such as Downtown Miami, Downtown Detroit, Center City Philadelphia or Downtown Los Angeles) are {{experiencing}} a renewal, with large population growth, residential apartment construction, and increased social, cultural, and infrastructural investments, as have suburban neighborhoods close to city centers. Better public transit, proximity to work and cultural attractions, and frustration with suburban life and <b>gridlock</b> have attracted young Americans to the city centers.|$|E

25|$|Organization {{typically}} {{produces a}} better combination of travel safety and efficiency. Events which disrupt the flow and may cause traffic to degenerate into a disorganized mess include road construction, collisions, and debris in the roadway. On particularly busy freeways, a minor disruption may persist in a {{phenomenon known as}} traffic waves. A complete breakdown of organization may result in traffic congestion and <b>gridlock.</b> Simulations of organized traffic frequently involve queuing theory, stochastic processes and equations of mathematical physics applied to traffic flow.|$|E

His constituents elected him in large part to resolve the <b>gridlock</b> that prevented the completion of the railroad extension from St. Cloud west to Alexandria and beyond. The railroad company, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (SP), had run out of funds to complete the St. Vincent extension, and the bondholders were unwilling to invest further.

25|$|Following Act 72, Rendell and the Pennsylvania {{legislature}} {{looked at}} other proposals to reduce property taxes, {{a key component}} of his 2002 campaign. The governor said he was willing to consider legislation that changes Act 72, and legislative proposals were made to force school districts to accept the money. Other proposed legislation would have required the issue to be voted on in each district as a ballot question, rather than decided by school boards. Property tax relief and Act 72 were issues of great controversy and have been subject to political <b>gridlock,</b> and it was unclear when changes would be made.|$|E

Trevor Mallard and Phil Goff cited the results of recent opinion polls that showed widespread public opposition or apathy (results are shown in the section below). These were used {{to argue that the}} referendums were unnecessary as the question was already answered by the public as a clear negative.|$|E
25|$|The motorway, {{which was}} first {{proposed}} in the 1930s, and conceived as two separate routes, was opened in stages between 1971 and 1976, with construction beginning at Pole Moor and finishing {{at that time in}} Tarbock on the outskirts of Liverpool. The motorway absorbed the northern end of the Stretford-Eccles bypass, which was built between 1957 and 1960. Adjusted for inflation to 2007, its construction cost approximately £765million. The motorway has an average daily traffic flow of 144,000 vehicles in West Yorkshire, and has several areas prone to <b>gridlock,</b> in particular, between Leeds and Huddersfield. The M62 coach bombing of 1974 and the Great Heck rail crash of 2001 are the largest incidents to have occurred on the M62.|$|E
