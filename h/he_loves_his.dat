On-screen the character’s plans to abscond with Ricky {{and her son}} (on the night of her {{surprise}} birthday party) were thwarted by Barry’s discovery of the affair – leading to a public confrontation between the three protagonists. Shaun Williamson who played Barry has commented “Barry is absolutely devastated as his whole life is ripped apart. He can’t believe Nat has betrayed him. <b>He</b> <b>loves</b> <b>his</b> life with Natalie and Jack, and {{would do anything to}} make it work as a family again. Losing Natalie is going to be really difficult for Barry, but I think the hardest thing will be losing his son.” The storyline signified the end of the characters’ three-year marriage and in a final plot twist Natalie opted to finish with Ricky and leave Walford alone, having discovered that he had recently slept with his ex-wife Samantha.|$|E

What Dublin got from James Joyce—a sprawling, ambitious, loving, exasperated and playful chronicle of all its good and bad parts—Detroit has from native son Eugenides in these 500 pages." [...] David Kipen of the San Francisco Chronicle agreed, opining [...] "mong so many other things, this praiseworthy, prize-worthy yarn succeeds as a heartbroken mash note to the Detroit of Eugenides' birth, a city whose neighborhoods he sometimes appears to love—as <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>his</b> characters—less for their virtues than for their defects. Any book that can make a reader actively want to visit Detroit must have one honey of a tiger in its tank." ...|$|E

500|$|Asher's life is {{complicated}} by his mother and brother. He has been a father-figure to Sol since a young age, and, as revealed in episode nine, has cared for him through their mother's schizophrenic episodes. Thompson assessed that Asher {{is not necessarily the}} best role model for Sol, but is willing to {{go to great lengths to}} protect him and ensure his success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch to secure Sol a place in the dance group. Thompson said that looking after Sol has [...] "taken a toll on [...] ". Although he initially feels optimistic about moving to Walford, he loses perspective and makes a mistake by sleeping with Naz. Thompson deemed this out of character for Asher, as <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>his</b> brother so much, but opined that despite his mistakes, Asher is still a good brother: [...] "At heart, he's like anyone trying to do well. He wants to escape his old past and do well by his brother." ...|$|E

500|$|Burt is {{the father}} of glee club member Kurt Hummel. Colfer has {{credited}} his off-screen relationship with O'Malley with improving the quality of their scenes together, and O'Malley has said the same about working with Colfer. Burt loves Kurt, and openly accepts his son after Kurt tells him that he is gay in the show's fourth episode, [...] "Preggers". Murphy took the scene verbatim from his own experience of coming out to his father. He called the father-son relationship [...] "One of the stories that we really love on the show", and one that is [...] "very personal" [...] to him, as he wishes his own father had acted more like Burt. During the first season, Kurt has cause to wonder whether his father truly accepts him. Colfer offered the insight that his character is [...] "more concerned with being OK in his dad's eyes than with anyone else", and said that the bond between them would continue to strengthen as the series progressed. From O'Malley's point of view, [...] "There's a lot at stake in their relationship and [...] trying to show other people how it can be, in a positive way. I'm not saying hey, let's go to Greenwich Village and be in the parade. This is very very difficult, but <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>his</b> son." ...|$|E

500|$|Into Temptation {{marks the}} second film by {{independent}} filmmaker Patrick Coyle, who {{wrote and directed}} the 2003 drama film Detective Fiction. Coyle said Into Temptation was partially inspired by his father, James Patrick Coyle, a kind but belligerent {{man who had been}} encouraged by his mother to become a priest. James entered seminary but dropped out before ordination after he was drafted into serving overseas in World War II and met Margaret Mary Quinlan, who would become his wife and Patrick Coyle's mother. Coyle conceived of the script for Into Temptation while imagining what kind of priest his father would have been. His father strongly approved of the project, and told Coyle, [...] "Go make that movie. And tell the truth." [...] Coyle was also partially inspired by his childhood pastor and friend, the Reverend Damian Zuerlein, who performed the marriage ceremony for Coyle and his wife and baptized their children. Coyle said of him, [...] "He's just a young, energetic, competent, committed, devoted man working with a poor parish. And <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>his</b> work. I was inspired by that." [...] Coyle said when writing Into Temptation, he did not intend to make a religious film, and said of protagonist Father John Buerlein, [...] "The character could have been a minister or a rabbi or a public defender. He's a good man trying to do a job the best he can." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{separate}} interviews {{early in}} 2011 both Davies brothers spoke positively about a potential reunion. Dave Davies explained, [...] "There's {{nothing in the}} pipeline yet, but... we'll see. It's possible." [...] Each has said that any reunion would be dependent on the other. According to Ray Davies, the brothers were to meet in April to discuss future plans. [...] In October that year, Dave Davies quashed rumours of a reunion, stating {{in an interview that}} although <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>his</b> brother, [...] "I just can't stand to be with him. About an hour with Ray's my limit, so {{it would be a very}} short reunion." [...] In November of that year Ray Davies reported that he had recently recorded with Avory [...] "just to sort of try to do what we call demos... we might do it in fits and starts and bring Dave in at a later date. I'll never say never with my brother, because he's totally unpredictable." [...] In a 2013 Skype interview Dave Davies expressed interest in doing reunions shows. On 18 December 2015, Ray Davies joined Dave Davies onstage at the Islington Assembly Hall in London to perform [...] "You Really Got Me".

500|$|The pro-Church accounts, by contrast, {{described}} a boy very much resolved {{to stay where}} he was, and horrified by his mother's exhortations {{to return to the}} Judaism of his ancestors. In this narrative, the main reason for the Mortaras' grief was not that their son had been taken, but that he now stood to grow up in the Christian faith. According to La Civiltà Cattolica, Marianna flew into a rage on seeing a medallion hanging from Edgardo's neck bearing the image of the Virgin Mary, and ripped it off; one article {{went so far as to}} claim the Jewish mother had done this with the words: [...] "I'd rather see you dead than a Christian!" [...] Some of the Church's critics had charged that by keeping Edgardo, it was violating the commandment that a child should honour his father and mother—La Civiltà Cattolica countered that Edgardo still loved his family despite their religious differences and indeed, after being taught by the priests to read and write, had chosen to write his first letter to his mother, signing it [...] "your most affectionate little son". Louis Veuillot, the ultramontane editor of the L'Univers newspaper and one of the Pope's staunchest defenders, reported after meeting Edgardo in Rome that the boy had told him [...] "that <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>his</b> father and his mother, and that he will go to live with them when he is older... so that he can speak to them of Saint Peter, of God, and of the most Holy Mary." ...|$|E

500|$|Barbirolli refused {{invitations to}} take up more prestigious and lucrative conductorships. Shortly after {{he took over the}} Hallé he {{received}} an offer from the sponsors of an ambitious scheme that would have put him in charge of the London Symphony Orchestra, and in the early 1950s the BBC sought to recruit him for the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Also in the early 1950s the head of the Royal Opera House, David Webster, wanted him to become the musical director there. Barbirolli conducted six operas for Webster, Turandot, Aida, Orfeo ed Euridice, Tristan und Isolde, La bohème and Madama Butterfly, 1951–53, but he declined to be wooed away from the Hallé. His biographer Charles Reid wrote, [...] "His Manchester kingdom is a kingdom indeed. He is not manacled or chivied in his choice of programmes. Broadly speaking he conducts only what <b>he</b> <b>loves...</b> <b>His</b> kingdom approximates to a conductor's paradise." [...] Nevertheless, in 1958, after building the orchestra up and touring continually, conducting up to 75 concerts a year, he arranged a less onerous schedule, allowing him more time to appear as a guest conductor with other orchestras. He also appeared at the Vienna State Opera, and Rome Opera House, where he conducted Aida in 1969. In 1960 he accepted an invitation to succeed Leopold Stokowski as chief conductor of the Houston Symphony in Texas, a post he held until 1967, conducting an annual total of 12 weeks there in early spring and late autumn between Hallé engagements. In 1961 he began a regular association with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, which lasted {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
