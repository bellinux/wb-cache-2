The filtrate of S. aureus {{culture has been}} used as ampul named Staphylococcal enterotoxin C injection in clinic for 10 years in China and proved to be effective.

The MTT assay of the purified rSEM and rSEN demonstrated that their abilities of stimulating T cells and inhibiting the proliferation of K 562 –ADM cells and B 16 cells were equivalent to that of purified SEC 2 in vitro. These findings suggested that SEC was not the only active component of Staphylococcal enterotoxin C injection and the effective procedure of expression and purification may be useful for mass productions of these therapeutically important proteins...|$|R

40|$|The {{relevance}} of the problem under study {{is based on the}} necessity to determine the directions of studying and improving the vocational pedagogical education (the system of training vocational pedagogical teachers) in Russia. The purpose of the article is to identify the periodization of <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> development of the vocational pedagogical education in Russia depending upon the changes of its organizational <b>and</b> pedagogical <b>foundations</b> that occur under the influence of socio-economic and socio-pedagogical factors. The leading approach to studying this problem is historic-logical one which allows us to identify stages of <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> development of the vocational pedagogical education based on the qualitative changes of its organization and content that are perceived as a reaction to socio-economic and socio-pedagogical conditions at certain periods of time. Based on the qualitative changes of the organizational <b>and</b> pedagogical <b>foundations</b> of the vocational pedagogical education occurred {{under the influence of the}} changes in the society during more than a hundred years’ time, the stages of <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> development of the vocational education are detailed in this article.

It is shown that the idea of industry-specific vocational and psychological training and training for a worker’s profession is the leading one in elaborating the vocation education development strategy. The article can be useful for academic specialists and practitioners in the sphere of vocational and vocational pedagogical education, candidates for a master’s degree and students of vocational pedagogical universities and faculties. © 2016 Fedorov and Tretyakova...|$|R
