They {{gathered}} as many pieces of , rock-star mica, as they could find, {{and put them on}} a blanket. Then First Man made a drawing in the dirt to plan the location of all the stars seeking to make the sky like a woven rug, orderly and balanced. [...] , Black Yéʼii, placed the [...] (North Star). First Man placed the [...] (Big Dipper) while First Woman put the [...] (Little Dipper) into the sky.

The Coyote named First Angry returned {{to see what was going}} on. [...] He took a piece of rock-star mica and placed it on the sky, and it became , known by Bilagáana as Canopus. [...] He placed another piece in the south, , Morning Star. Then Coyote said, [...] "This is too long. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> way."

30|$|Employing {{arguments}} {{which are}} similar to those used in Remark  3.4, comparing (69) and (2.48) in [15], we conclude that Algorithm 3.2 (<b>I)</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> contraction property than the hybrid alternating CQ-algorithm in [15].|$|R

6000|$|... "'Shouldn't wonder. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> horse {{it would}} be a lively race; but Buck can't keep this pace long, and if he founders we are in a fix, for I can't run, and you can't fight. Betsey, there's more than one; hold tight and try to count 'em.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Thank you, doctor," [...] I {{answered}} politely, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> {{way to make}} my living." [...] In {{three years}} I had learned a little to control my temper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle Venner" [...] {{observed}} Clifford in a drowsy, inward tone, [...] "is {{always talking}} about his farm. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> scheme for him, by and by. We shall see!" ...|$|E
60|$|MARCHBANKS (turning to her). In {{a hundred}} years, {{we shall be}} the same age. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> secret than that in my heart. Let me go now. The night outside grows impatient.|$|E

To the north of that, again, there comes another cape--Cape of the Woods, as it was marked upon the chart--buried in tall green pines, which descended to the margin of the sea.|$|R

5000|$|Cain briefly {{ran for the}} Republican presidential {{nomination}} in 2000; {{he says it was}} more about making political statements than winning the nomination. [...] "George W.

60|$|It was {{not until}} I opened their eyes that they knew their degradation. I invited the Mayor to Hackton, and Mrs. Mayoress (a very buxom pretty groceress she was, by the way) I made sit by my wife, and drove them both out to the races in my curricle. Lady Lyndon fought very hard against this condescension; but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> way with her, as the saying is, and though she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> temper, yet <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> one. <b>A</b> temper, psha! <b>A</b> wild-cat <b>has</b> <b>a</b> temper, but a keeper can {{get the better of}} it; and I know very few women in the world whom I could not master.|$|R
