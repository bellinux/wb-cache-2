5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E
25|$|In the 2003 revival {{starring}} Bernadette Peters, {{the final}} dialogue scene remains, but leaves the ending open to more interpretation from the audience. Louise {{walks through the}} stage door, with Rose following behind. Rose then turns to face the audience, a look of sadness and longing on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> takes {{one last look at}} the empty stage. She pauses and slowly closes the door.|$|E
2500|$|Corby {{was taken}} from her prison to a Bali {{hospital}} in June 2008 to be treated for depression. In July 2008, she was permitted to leave her hospital ward under armed guard to visit a beauty salon located within the hospital grounds to have her hair done and for a pedicure. While {{she was at the}} salon, word of her presence got out and, upon leaving the salon, Corby was faced with a large number of reporters. She attempted to hide <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> left the salon and her doctor stated that her condition was [...] "back to zero" [...] and that additional treatment for depression would be needed. On 9 July 2008, she was returned to the prison, ending a stay of {{two and a half weeks}} in the hospital. Corby was again taken to the hospital on 22 May 2009 for depression.|$|E
60|$|She {{pulled her}} arm away, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> working <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{fought against the}} tears that would not keep back.|$|R
60|$|Her voice died away, and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> burnt <b>as</b> <b>she</b> looked down; but a {{few words}} of {{interest}} led her on.|$|R
6000|$|... "But not yet gone," [...] she answered; and a {{profound}} sense of foreboding spread over <b>her</b> speaking <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> uttered the words.|$|R
2500|$|Wray {{was also}} a member {{of one of the most}} famous B-movie units at work during what is now viewed as the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood -- a group whose {{creative}} energy and inventiveness made Lewton's success possible. She spoke about working with the group in a conversation with her daughter many years later, a recollection that shines a clear light on the group's chemistry and skill, and the special place it held in Wray's heart:She rarely spoke about her early career or the McCarthy era. [...] But when I asked once what it was like working with Lewton, she smiled -- thought about it for a long moment -- and then told me about the night the group spent figuring out how to build to the first murder in The Leopard Man. [...] The scene she had written was pure psychological terror, trading on very basic fears -- of the dark, of being punished unjustly, locked out of your own home, abandoned by people you trust -- and at the same time it sets up the mystery that is the premise of the entire film. [...] They were under pressure to get this sequence right, and almost everyone was there that night. The session went well into the small hours of the morning, was filled with laughter, and included a hilarious riff as one of them experimented with a set of castanets, which turned out to be the key to building the tension and suspense. They worked their way through a dozen different shot sequences before they were satisfied and, listening to her, I had the very strong impression that they would have come up with that same elegant, powerful scene even if they had been working with an A-movie budget and had more time. [...] As Agee so famously observed about Lewton, these were people who understood film and cared about human beings. [...] I can still see the smile on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> recalled that night. [...] -- Stefani Warren, September 2016 ...|$|E
60|$|He waited, {{his eyes}} on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> gazed about her in rapture.|$|E
6000|$|A {{motion of}} {{satisfaction}} enlivened <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> read the complete inscription. First came {{the words of}} Troy himself:-- ...|$|E
60|$|The {{poor girl}} heard, but {{no sign of}} {{appreciation}} moved <b>her</b> pale <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> gazed up at the approaching chaos of waters.|$|R
60|$|Mirah paused {{with a sweet}} {{content in}} <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> were having her happy vision, while she looked out toward the river.|$|R
6000|$|These words (I was {{watching}} <b>her</b> white <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> spoke) {{gave me a}} slight shudder. She remained demure, almost prim. And I remarked: ...|$|R
60|$|But {{there was}} a smile on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> spoke, and Sir John smiled also when he saw it.|$|E
60|$|His tone had softened. There was the {{slightest}} {{trace of a}} frown upon <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> looked along the riverside.|$|E
6000|$|... "And Lady Lufton--" [...] said Lucy, {{speaking}} hardly above a whisper, {{and still}} hiding <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> leaned against her sister's shoulder.|$|E
60|$|When {{they reached}} the hall-door she had one more {{question}} to ask; {{but she could not}} look in <b>her</b> father's <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> asked.|$|R
60|$|Ida {{took the}} letter, and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{hardened}} <b>as</b> <b>she</b> read. Then {{she looked at}} him with a suggestive straightening of her brows.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{no trace}} of embarrassment, apology, or even of {{consciousness}} in <b>her</b> pretty <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> replied, passing <b>her</b> hand lightly through his hair,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Slightly. We have mutual friends.' An {{ambiguous}} smile played across <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> spoke. 'This {{must have}} been taken after I saw him.' ...|$|E
60|$|In {{half an hour}} more, Alban and Emily were {{together}} again. The light fell full on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> rose to receive him.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} Muriel strolled {{back towards}} Jacinta, {{and glanced at}} her with a suggestion of astonishment in <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> sat down.|$|E
6000|$|Herminia {{hesitated a}} second. Then two crimson spots flared forth on <b>her</b> {{speaking}} <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> answered with an effort, [...] "About you too, Alan." ...|$|R
60|$|The fright and abhorrence that Mrs Betty Higden {{smoothed}} out of <b>her</b> strong <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> ended this diversion, showed how seriously she had meant it.|$|R
6000|$|... "A forced {{smile is}} uglier than a frown," [...] said Miriam, a bright, natural smile {{breaking}} out over <b>her</b> <b>face</b> even <b>as</b> <b>she</b> spoke.|$|R
60|$|She {{drew her}} veil over <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> spoke, and, {{partially}} opening the door, rang my handbell. Peter appeared, and received his instructions.|$|E
60|$|Mischief, spirit, and glee sparkled {{all over}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> thus bandied words {{with the old}} Cossack, who almost equally enjoyed the tilt.|$|E
60|$|As she {{unfolded}} it a {{strip of}} paper fell out, and the warm blood swept into <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> read the message on it.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>face</b> flushed <b>as</b> <b>she</b> said it; mine also, for I read in it a declaration, and {{my heart}} swelled for joy. But Chevenix grew pale.|$|R
60|$|As I brought {{another of}} the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down, I remarked a new {{expression}} on <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> were afraid of me.|$|R
6000|$|... "What has happened, sir?" [...] <b>she</b> asked. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> altered <b>as</b> <b>she</b> put the question, and {{her large}} black eyes {{hardened}} fiercely, in genuine astonishment and alarm.|$|R
60|$|Lane had his reward in {{the sweet}} amaze and {{confusion}} of <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> turned away. Holt rushed her off amid the straggling couples.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, sir, thank you, it's quite well," [...] {{answered}} Martha, blushing {{through the}} dirt on <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> eyed the fallen food anxiously.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He laughs like this--"Hee-hee-hee!"' Picotee {{introduced}} as much antiquity into <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could by screwing {{it up and}} suiting the action to the word.|$|E
60|$|Then she paused, and {{stretched}} out her arms, and stood there quite still, with a heavenly smile upon <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> though <b>she</b> were the very Spirit of the Flame.|$|R
6000|$|... "Release my pony's head!" [...] <b>she</b> cried, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> flushing, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> gave a jerk to the reins. [...] "How dare you? What right {{have you}} to detain me?" ...|$|R
60|$|Down {{upon her}} knees Columbine fell. Both hands flew to cover <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> And <b>as</b> <b>she</b> swayed forward she shook violently, and there escaped her lips a little, muffled sound.|$|R
