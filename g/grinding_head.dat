40|$|Abstract. The {{hydraulic}} elastic {{feed drive}} utilizes a hydraulic bellows tube as actuator. While pressure oil is inlet, the bellows tube will axially expand and act a pushing {{force on the}} vertical arm of the grinding frame. This pushing force will cause the deformation of the elastic arm and thus the displacement of the <b>grinding</b> <b>head.</b> To the extent of elasticity, the displacement of the deformation is linearly proportional {{to the value of}} pressure. Thus, by controlling the pressure wave form, the desired trajectory of the <b>grinding</b> <b>head</b> can be obtained. A pressure valve is used to create the pressure waves. In this paper, the dynamic characteristics, which significantly affect the position accuracy of the <b>grinding</b> <b>head</b> and thus the surface finish quality of the non-circular element are theoretically analyzed. A special experiment has been designed to test the performance of the hydraulic elastic feed drive, in which a constant force is applied to simulate the grinding force while the <b>grinding</b> <b>head</b> is keeping track of the contour of non-circular element.

30|$|Computer-controlled {{deterministic}} polishing is {{the main}} method used to improve the accuracy of a complex curved surface shape [8, 9]. This type of polishing mainly applies CNC polishing technology with a small <b>grinding</b> <b>head</b> [10, 11], balloon polishing technology [12 – 14], magneto-rheological polishing technology [15, 16], ion beam polishing technology [17, 18], and jet polishing technology [19]. Because computer-controlled deterministic polishing is accomplished by controlling the amount of material removed through control of the tool’s residence time (or feed rate) at different points on the surface [20 – 23], surface errors need to be calculated based on the actual surface measurements prior to polishing. Moreover, a quantitative modeling and analysis should be conducted on the material removal when polishing {{with the aim of}} controlling the amount of materials removed in an accurate manner. The material removal rates of different points on a work piece surface vary owing to the complexity of the free-form surface, and coupled with the influence of other factors, it is difficult to establish a precise mathematical model. Meanwhile, difficulty also exists in further improving the surface detection precision of the components owing to a limitation of the current detection conditions. After generating a dwell function, a 4 - or 5 -axis numerical control system is generally applied when processing a complex surface. Therefore, polishing technology based on this principle cannot presently be applied to a commercial process [24].|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2012. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Prof. Ephraim M. Sparrow. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 202, appendix A. Orbital atherectomy {{is a means}} of removing plaque from a stenosed artery which uses a <b>grinding</b> <b>head</b> attached to a catheter to break up the accumulated plaque. The <b>grinding</b> <b>head,</b> referred to as crown or burr, is rotated at very high rotational velocity during the operation, from 80, 000 rpm to 200, 000 rpm. Because of this high rotational velocity, there are many concerns regarding the possible harm {{that can be done to}} the patient. The original motivation for this thesis was to explore and quantify the fluid mechanics of rotational atherectomy. However, as the topic developed, it broaden appreciably to encompass the exploration of the efficacy of turbulence modeling, bubble nucleation and growth, two-phase flow in rotational systems, and means for determining difficult to measure fluid flow characteristics. The work that finally emerged was a synergistic blending of experimentation and numerical simulation. In some instances, the simulation guided the experimental work, while in others the experiments served to guide and validate the simulation models. Since rotational fluid mechanics underlay the entire enterprise, an imperative initial task was to deeply explore the applicability of various turbulence models to such flows. In that regard, the situation of single-phase flow in an annular space bounded by a rotating inner cylinder and a stationary outer cylinder was used as a standard. That physical situation had been the subject of an in-depth experiment-based doctoral thesis noteworthy for its care and attention to detail. The examination of the efficacy of turbulence modeling encompassed two different categories of models. One of these categories dealt with models based on isotropic turbulence. Models in this category result in a turbulent viscosity that is the same for all three possible directions of fluid flow. However, in consideration of the ultimate fluid flows to be considered here, which include superimposed axial and rotational motions, isotropic turbulence cannot be expected to prevail. In this light, consideration was also extended to models in which the isotropic turbulence assumption was dropped in favor of different turbulence intensities in each of the possible directions of fluid flow. To implement the use of non- isotropic turbulence models, certain existing formulations were extended to levels rarely encountered in the published literature. The outcome of the extensive study of turbulence models led to a logic-based selection of the optimum one for the fluid mechanic investigation that is central to this work. Another issue dealt with in preparation for the study of the rotational atherectomy device is the nucleation and growth of bubbles. The need for this focus was the concern, often suggested by certain medical practitioners, that the high-rotational velocities of the device would give rise to locally low pressures in the flowing medium (blood and additives). The existence of pressures below the vapor pressure of the medium would give rise to cavitation bubbles. The bursting of such bubbles is known to create a high-velocity jet which, if impinged on an artery wall, would cause necrosis. Bubbles may be created by a number of different physical processes other than cavitation. In particular, the presence or absence of nucleation sites is a major factor in the creation of bubbles. To gain a thoroughgoing understanding of the entire process of bubble creation and collapse, a theoretical development was pursued. That development was guided by experimental results present in the literature. The model that was created for the numerical simulation yielded results that were consonant with the experimental data. The possible presence of bubbles in a liquid flow creates a fluid regime termed twophase flow. To adhere to the rotational fluid theme, experiments and corresponding modeling was performed for an impeller-driven flow in a contained fluid environment. This physical situation is closely aligned with rotational atherectomy. The investigated situation was designed to enable an initial configuration in which the liquid interfaced with a gas at a horizontal free surface to metamorphize into a curved free-surface interface. In particular, a method of dealing with two-phase flows was evaluated and then successfully implemented. The main focus of the work was a synergistic fluid-mechanic analysis of the rotating atherectomy device positioned in two independent environments: (a) a transparent horizontal tube whose diameter was chosen to model that of the superficial femoral artery and (b) a large open-topped transparent container. The atherectomy device consisted, in essence, of a shaft on which is mounted an enlarged section called the crown. The crown is coated with an abrasive material whose function is to grind hardened plaque and thereby rejuvenate the arterial function. The tube-based experimentation provided both observational and quantitative data. With respect to former, flow visualizations implemented by means of a tracer medium did not reveal the presence of bubbles. With regard to this finding, it is relevant to convey the caveat that inherent optical constraints provided a bound on the smallest observable bubbles. The extracted quantitative information included velocity magnitudes which were compared with those of the numerical simulations and virtual congruence was found to occur. The injected tracer medium also enabled the observation of patterns of fluid flow. These patterns were found to be in close accord with those predicted by the simulations. An additional product of the experimentation was the opportunity provided to investigate situations which were beyond those that could be modeled numerically. These situations included the case in which the crown was positioned eccentrically and in which the shaft was flexible rather than rigid. These two realities brought in laboratory experimentation into close accord with the operational experience. From the experimentation in the open-topped container, both observational and quantitative results were also extracted. Again, these findings strongly supported those from the numerical simulations. Overall, the four interrelated parts of this thesis provided ample opportunity to delve deeply into highly complex fluid-mechanic phenomena. The logic-based selection of turbulence models represents the most complete study of this category compared with the less thoroughgoing comparable studies in the literature. The bubble nucleation and growth models implemented here were strongly supported by experimental data. With regard to the two-phase fluid-mechanic investigation, the overall satisfactory agreement of the numerical predictions with the experimental data provide license for the use of the simulation model for related problems involving the separation of particles immersed in a liquid medium. Finally, all the fluid-mechanic issues related to rotating atherectomy were fully resolved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Surface {{roughness}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parameters in grinding, which directly affects the quality of the processed surface and has quite a lot of effect on the shape and position accuracy, installation accuracy of the workpiece. In the grinding process, the surface roughness is formatted from the abrasive which effects on the surface of spherical head, and is the result of mutual interference between abrasive and spherical head. Many factors affect the surface roughness, such as the shape and size of contact roller, abrasive morphology, grinding method, the stiffness of machine tool and workpiece, abrasive wear and vibration in the machining process. All of these have an impact grinding surface roughness. In this paper, analyzed the belt speed, workpiece speed, abrasive size, workpiece diameter, sand-planting density on the surface roughness of spherical head in experimental. And the effect trend of factors on surface roughness of workpiece was analyzed. Some valuable information was provided for selecting suitable parameter in spherical <b>head</b> <b>grinding.</b> Introductions Surface roughness is a micro-geometry features which formed by Peaks and valleys and the smaller spacing on the machining surface.

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. There is {{currently}} no {{efficient way to}} quantitatively (precisely) remove material from work pieces in hard-to-reach cavities, such as turbine blades in a jet engine. There {{is a need to}} be able to smooth the cracks from the turbine blades with a controlled amount of material removal. Endoscopy is useful for navigating and inspecting features in internal cavities with a flexible body and a semi-rigid bending section. By turning control knobs on the endoscope, the bending section can access a workpiece on its lateral direction. In this research, it is hypothesized that an endoscope can be used to remotely grind a predetermined amount of material and smooth the cracks on a work piece. The research objectives are to set up a precise flexible machining operation and to measure the accuracy of the estimated amount of material that can be removed. Experiment results shows that a reasonable accuracy was achieved using a modified flexible medical endoscope. In this study, two models were built to estimate the pose (position and orientation) and force on a modified PENTAX ES- 3801 endoscope. The pose model was based on geometric analysis of the endoscope bending section. When the internal force was compensated in calculation, the average pose estimation error was less than 4 mm of distance and 5 degrees of bending angle. The force model was based on equilibrium analysis of the bending section and the average force prediction error was 0. 5 N in the range of 1 to 8 N. The experimental and estimated results prove that the pose and force of the flexible bending section can be predicted and monitored when subjected to varying loads from work piece. In grinding processes, self-excited vibration (chatter) will seriously degrade the geometric accuracy and surface finish of the workpiece. The proposed endoscopic machining tool is naturally vulnerable to chatter due to its high degrees of freedom and low structural rigidity. A dynamic model was built to study the self-excited vibration characteristics of the endoscopic machining tool. By analyzing the stability lobe diagram (SLD), optimized machining parameters were found to reduce the chatter. An on-line chatter detecting method is proposed to identify self-excited vibration in its early stage. Finally, a material removal rate (MRR) model was formulated to predict the amount of material removal in this endoscopic grinding process. By calculating the energy wasted by chatter and the effective energy spent on grinding, the MRR was predicted. Several machining experiments were conducted to validate the repeatability of the model and evaluate its accuracy. The average MRR prediction error is 22 % related to the measured MRR. Experiment results reveals that the current MRR prediction accuracy (in the scale of 0. 5 mg) is not high enough to meet industry requirement, which is believed to be 0. 004 mg for submillimeter size cracks. Recommendations of improving pose estimation and MRR prediction accuracies such as designing a more predictable endoscopic tool structure, using a sphere <b>grinding</b> tool <b>head</b> and adopting a pneumatic driving mechanism or tip mounted motor are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Shapes {{different}} from the traditional ones have been proposed for face worm gears and for conical and cylindrical worms that mesh with them. The proposed shapes {{are based on the}} concept of generating a face worm gear surface by use of a tilted head cutter instead of by the traditional use of a hob. (As used here, head cutter is also meant to signify, alternatively, a <b>head</b> <b>grinding</b> tool.) The gear-surface-generation equipment would be similar to that used for generation of spiral bevel and hypoid gears. In comparison with the corresponding traditional hob, a tilted head cutter according to the proposal would be larger, could be fabricated with greater precision, and would enable the generation of gear surfaces with greater precision and greater productivity. A face worm gear would be generated (see figure) by use of a tilted head cutter, the blades or grinding surfaces of which would have straight-line profiles. The tilt of the head cutter would prevent interference with teeth adjacent to the groove being cut or ground. A worm to mesh with the face worm gear would be generated by use of a tilted head cutter mounted on the cradle of a generating machine. The blades or grinding surfaces of the head cutter would have a parabolic profile and would deviate from the straight-line profiles of the head cutter for the face worm gear. The shortest distance between the worm and the cradle would follow a parabolic function during the cycle of meshing in the generating process to provide a parabolic function of transmission errors to the gear drive. The small mismatch between the profiles of the face-worm-gear and worm head cutters would make it possible to localize the bearing contact in the worm gear drive. The parabolic function of transmission errors could absorb discontinuous linear functions of transmission errors caused by errors of alignment; this could afford a significant benefit, in that such errors are main sources of noise and vibration in gear drives. The main advantage of using tilted head cutters is that cutting speeds are independent of the shape-generation processes, making it possible to choose cutting speeds that are optimum with respect to requirements to minimize temperatures and deformations during fabrication and improve the quality of finished parts...|$|R
