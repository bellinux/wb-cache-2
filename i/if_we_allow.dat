Given the strength of the case for even these founders having a European source, however, our best estimate is to assign ~81% of Ashkenazi lineages to a European source, ~8% to the Near East and ~1% further to the east in Asia, with ~10% remaining ambiguous... Thus at least two-thirds and most likely more than four-fifths of Ashkenazi maternal lineages have a European ancestry.|$|E

500|$|The {{proposal}} of using criminal sanctions to enforce attendance under this new system was opposed by MPs {{from both the}} Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, who believed compulsion and threats were the wrong approach to increasing participation.

[...] However, the Prime Minister's Queen's Speech in November 2007, which discussed the raise in school leaving age, suggested that pupils who failed to comply with new laws are to be expected to face fines or community service, rather than custodial sentencing which had previously been proposed. Local Authorities will also be expected to ensure pupils are participating up to 18 years of age.|$|E

2500|$|But {{bounding}} the {{computation time}} above by some concrete function f(n) often yields complexity classes {{that depend on}} the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {xx | x is any binary string} can be solved in linear time on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>allow</b> polynomial variations in running time, Cobham-Edmonds thesis states that [...] "the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related" [...] This forms {{the basis for the}} complexity class P, which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time.

2500|$|Assume that a {{function}} is defined from {{a subset of}} the real numbers to the real numbers. As in the case for sequences, the limit inferior and limit superior are always well-defined <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>allow</b> the values +∞ and -∞; in fact, if both agree then the limit exists and is equal to their common value (again possibly including the infinities).

The difference between the two is a rough measure of how [...] "wildly" [...] the function oscillates, and in observation of this fact, it is called the oscillation of f at a. This idea of oscillation is sufficient to, for example, characterize Riemann-integrable functions as [...] continuous except on a set of measure zero.

2500|$|The {{situation}} can be profitably {{compared to that}} which arises {{in the search for}} functions on the projective space P(V): in that setting, one would ideally like functions F on the vector space V which are polynomial in the coordinates of v≠0 in V and satisfy the equation F(cv)=F(v) for all non-zero c. Unfortunately, the only such functions are constants. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>allow</b> denominators (rational functions instead of polynomials), we can let F be the ratio of two homogeneous polynomials of the same degree. Alternatively, we can stick with polynomials and loosen the dependence on c, letting F(cv)=c'k'F(v). The solutions are then the homogeneous polynomials of degree [...] On the one hand, these form a finite dimensional vector space for eachk, and on the other, if we let k vary, we can find the numerators and denominators for constructing all the rational functions which are really functions on the underlying projective spaceP(V).|$|E
