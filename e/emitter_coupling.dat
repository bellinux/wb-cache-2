40|$|We explore photon {{coincidence}} counting {{statistics in}} the ultrastrong-coupling regime where the atom-cavity coupling rate becomes {{comparable to the}} cavity resonance frequency. In this regime usual normal order correlation functions fail to describe the output photon statistics. By expressing the electric-field operator in the cavity-emitter dressed basis {{we are able to}} propose correlation functions that are valid for arbitrary degrees of light-matter interaction. Our results show that the standard photon blockade scenario is significantly modified for ultrastrong coupling. We observe parametric processes even for two-level emitters and temporal oscillations of intensity correlation functions at a frequency given by the ultrastrong photon <b>emitter</b> <b>coupling.</b> These effects {{can be traced back to}} the presence of two-photon cascade decays induced by counter-rotating interaction terms.

40|$|To {{meet the}} {{challenge}} of precise nanoscale arrangement of emitter and plasmonic nanoantenna, synthesis and assembly methods continue to evolve in accuracy and reproducibility. This article reviews some of the many strategies being developed for "soft" chemical approaches to precision integration and assembly. We also discuss investigations of the Purcell effect, emission directionality control, and near-unity collection efficiency of photons, emitter <b>emitter</b> <b>coupling,</b> and higher-order emission processes that have been most deeply explored using individual-emitter- (or several-emitter-) nanoantenna pairs fabricated using traditional lithographic methods or dynamically and controllably manipulated using scanning probe methods. Importantly, these results along with theoretical analyses inspire and motivate continued advancements in large-scale synthesis and assembly. We emphasize assembly approaches that have been used to create nanosemiconductor-nanometal hybrids and, in particular, those that have afforded specific plasmonic effects on excitonic properties. We also review direct-synthesis and chemical-linker strategies to creating discrete, though less spatially extended, semiconductor-metal interactions...|$|E

40|$|Quantum emitters, such as q-dots and dye molecules, in the {{immediate}} vicinity of plasmonic nanostructures, resonantly excite surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs) under incoherent pump. The efficiency in the excitation of SPPs increases as the number of the emitters, because the SPP field synchronizes emission of the <b>coupled</b> <b>emitters,</b> in analogy with the superadiance (SR) of <b>coupled</b> <b>emitters</b> in free space. Using fully quantum mechanical model for two <b>emitters</b> <b>coupled</b> to a single gold nanorod, we predict up to 15 % increase in the emission yield of single emitter compared to only one <b>emitter</b> <b>coupled</b> to the nanorod due to plasmonic SR. (XW: I use emission yield because the quantum efficiency is one for emitters in free space and {{there is no room for}} enhancement). Such emission enhancement is stationary and should be observable even with strong dissipation and dephasing under incoherent pump. Solid-state quantum emitters with blinking behaviors may be utilized to demonstrate such plasmonic SR emission enhancement. Plasmonic SR may find implications in the excitation of non-radiative modes in plasmonic waveguides; and lowing threshold of plasmonic nanolasers...|$|R
