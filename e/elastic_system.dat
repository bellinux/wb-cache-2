40|$|Abstract. Digital {{electronic}} systems typically use synchronous clocks and pri-marily assume fixed duration of their operations {{to simplify the}} design process. Time <b>elastic</b> <b>systems</b> can be constructed either by replacing the clock with com-munication handshakes (asynchronous version) or by augmenting the clock with a synchronous version of a handshake (synchronous version). Time elastic sys-tems can tolerate static and dynamic changes in delays (asynchronous case) or la-tencies (synchronous case) of operations {{that can be used}} for modularity, ease of reuse and better power-delay trade-off. This paper describes methods for the mod-eling, performance analysis and optimization of <b>elastic</b> <b>systems</b> using Marked Graphs and their extensions capable of describing behavior with early evaluation. The paper uses synchronous <b>elastic</b> <b>systems</b> (aka latency-tolerant systems) for illustrating the use of Petri Nets, however most of the methods can be applied without changes (except changing the delay model associated with events of the <b>system)</b> to asynchronous <b>elastic</b> <b>systems.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Cloud-based <b>elastic</b> <b>systems</b> {{leverage}} cloud infras-tructures {{to implement}} elasticity, {{the ability of}} computing systems to dynamically adjust their capacity by changing the allocation of resources in response to fluctuating workloads. The runtime behavior of <b>elastic</b> <b>systems</b> {{is the result of}} an intricate interplay of many factors that include the input workload, the elasticity logic determining the resources allocation, and the technology of the underlying cloud. This makes <b>elastic</b> <b>systems</b> difficult to design and hard to specify. In this paper we propose a novel formalization of elasticity and related concepts that is based on timed patterns written using timed regular expressions. Timed regular expressions naturally deal with dense-time signals, and timed patterns allow us to intuitively describe relevant changes in those signals. This, in turn, enables us to directly characterize elasticity as relation between relevant changes in the input workload and in the resources allocation signals. We firstly characterize the relevant changes by means of timed patterns, and then we define desired and undesired behaviors of cloud-based <b>elastic</b> <b>systems</b> in terms of the occurrence of such patterns over an observation period.

In order to gain reasonable results, multivariate statistical tools are applied.
