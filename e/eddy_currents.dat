5|$|The usual {{magnetostrictive}} {{materials used}} for the transducer are either ferrite or compressed powdered iron. Mechanical filter designs often have the resonators coupled with steel or nickel-iron wires, but on some designs, especially older ones, nickel wire may be {{used for the}} input and output rods. This is because it is possible to wind the transducer coil directly on to a nickel coupling wire since nickel is slightly magnetostrictive. However, it is not strongly so and coupling to the electrical circuit is weak. This scheme also has the disadvantage of <b>eddy</b> <b>currents,</b> a problem that is avoided if ferrites are used instead of nickel.|$|E
25|$|<b>Eddy</b> <b>currents</b> {{occur when}} a solid {{metallic}} mass is rotated in a magnetic field, because the outer {{portion of the}} metal cuts more lines of force than the inner portion, hence the induced electromotive force not being uniform, tends to set up currents between the points of greatest and least potential. <b>Eddy</b> <b>currents</b> consume {{a considerable amount of}} energy and often cause a harmful rise in temperature.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{deals with}} <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> loss of {{magnetic}} coupling with radial permanent magnet (PM) using analytical method {{such as a}} space harmonic method. Superposition of two kinds analysis model is used to analyze <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> loss induced in inner PM and outer PM of magnetic coupling. When the <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> is induced, the environmental temperature increases, and the permanent magnet(PM) characteristics are degraded because the performance of PM is greatly influenced by temperature rise. Hence, the calculation of <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> loss becomes {{an important factor in}} the magnetic coupling. In order to analyze <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> loss, first, {{on the basis of the}} magnetic vector potential and two-dimensional(2 -D) polar-coordinate system, the magnetic field solutions of the radial magnetized PM are obtained. And we obtain the analytical solutions for the <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> density produced by permanent magnet. Lastly, analytical solutions for <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> loss are derived by using equivalent, electrical resistance calculated from magnet volume and analytical solution for <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> density.

25|$|The relay's {{primary winding}} is {{supplied}} {{from the power}} systems current transformer via a plug bridge, which is called the plug setting multiplier (psm). Usually seven equally spaced tappings or operating bands determine the relays sensitivity. The primary winding {{is located on the}} upper electromagnet. The secondary winding has connections on the upper electromagnet that are energised from the primary winding and connected to the lower electromagnet. Once the upper and lower electromagnets are energised they produce <b>eddy</b> <b>currents</b> that are induced onto the metal disc and flow through the flux paths.

40|$|Induction heating is {{the process}} of heating a {{material}} through the generation of <b>eddy</b> <b>current.</b> An external applied alternating magnetic field is applied, and heat is generated from the resistance to the <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> (i. e., Joule heating). <b>Eddy</b> <b>current</b> is the main heat source; however, heat may also be generated in magnetic materials from alternating magnetization and hysteresis. The induced current is commonly called <b>eddy</b> <b>current,</b> although it is also known as Foucault current after its discoverer, Jean Bernard Léon Foucault (1819 – 1868). We will, in the following text, use the notation <b>eddy</b> <b>current.</b> In general, the <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> distribution inside the work piece is not uniform. The magnitude of the <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> attenuates exponentially beneath the surface, which implies that the current density near the surface is greater than at a depth.

This can greatly improve efficiency, but variable-speed controllers must use a higher switching rate (>40kHz) or DC because of the decreased electromagnetic induction.|$|E

In this work, we aimed to predict, using linear response theory, the residual 3 -D <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> field required for geometric distortion correction based on phantom <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> field measurements. The predicted 3 -D <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> field induced by the diffusion-weighting gradients was able to reduce the {{root mean square error}} of the residual <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> field to ~ 1 Hz. The model's performance was tested on diffusion weighted images of four normal volunteers, following distortion correction, the quality of the Stejskal-Tanner diffusion-weighted images was found to have comparable quality to image registration based corrections (FSL) at low b-values. Unlike registration techniques the correction was not hindered by low SNR at high b-values, and results in improved image quality relative to FSL. Characterization of the 3 -D <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> field with linear response theory enables the prediction of the 3 -D <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> field required to correct <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> induced geometric distortions {{for a wide range of}} clinical and high b-value protocols...|$|R
40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{computationally}} efficient analytical method, for accurate prediction of three-dimensional (3 D) <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> {{loss in the}} rotor magnets of surface mounted permanent magnet (SPM) machines considering slotting effect. Subdomain model incorporating stator tooth tips is employed to generate the information on radial and tangential time-derivatives of 2 D magnetic field (<b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> sources) within the magnet. The distribution of the <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> sources in 3 D is established for the magnets by applying the <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> boundary conditions and the Coulomb gauge imposed on the current vector potential.

The <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> loss variations in the rotor magnets with axial and circumferential number of segmentations are studied. The reduction of magnet <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> loss is investigated with respect to harmonic wavelength of the source components to suggest a suitable segmentation for the rotor magnets in SPM machines...|$|R

25|$|The disc is {{acted upon}} by {{two sets of}} coils, which form, in effect, a two phase {{induction}} motor. One coil is connected {{in such a way}} that it produces a magnetic flux in proportion to the voltage and the other produces a magnetic flux in proportion to the current. The field of the voltage coil is delayed by 90 degrees, due to the coil's inductive nature, and calibrated using a lag coil. This produces <b>eddy</b> <b>currents</b> in the disc and the effect is such that a force is exerted on the disc in proportion to the product of the instantaneous current, voltage and phase angle (power factor) between them. A permanent magnet acts as an eddy current brake, exerting an opposing force proportional to the speed of rotation of the disc. The equilibrium between these two opposing forces results in the disc rotating at a speed proportional to the power or rate of energy usage. The disc drives a register mechanism which counts revolutions, much like the odometer in a car, in order to render a measurement of the total energy used.|$|E
