40|$|With {{the goal}} of {{lowering}} the cost of payload to orbit, NASA/MSFC (Marshall Space Flight Center) researched ways to decrease the complexity and cost of an engine system and its components for a small two-stage booster vehicle. The composite nozzle for this Fastrac Engine was designed, built and tested by MSFC with fabrication support and engineering from Thiokol-SEHO (Science and Engineering Huntsville Operation). The Fastrac nozzle uses materials, fabrication processes and design features that are inexpensive, simple and easily manufactured. As the low cost nozzle (and injector) design matured through the subscale tests and into full scale hot <b>fire</b> <b>testing,</b> X- 34 chose the Fastrac engine for the propulsion plant for the X- 34. Modifications were made to nozzle design {{in order to meet}} the new flight requirements. The nozzle design has evolved through subscale testing and manufacturing demonstrations to full CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics), thermal, thermomechanical and dynamic analysis and the required component and engine system tests to validate the design. The Fastrac nozzle is now in final <b>development</b> hot <b>fire</b> <b>testing</b> and has successfully accumulated 66 hot <b>fire</b> <b>tests</b> and 1804 seconds on 18 different nozzles...|$|R

40|$|A {{greenhouse}} {{study was}} conducted {{to determine the effects of}} deposition from static rocket <b>test</b> <b>fires</b> on corn and alfalfa. Seeds were germinated in a wide concentration range of depositional material, called <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil (TFS). Additionally, the impact of chloride and aluminum, two major components of <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil, on germination was also evaluated. Furthermore, plants were grown in packed columns and exposed to <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil, either in the root zone or on foliage. Tissue was weighed and analyzed to compare biomass production and plant composition. Corn and alfalfa exposed to <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil in the root zone produced less biomass than controls, but foliar treatment had no effect on biomass production. No kernels were produced by corn exposed to <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil in the root zone. Leaves of plants exposed to <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil in the root zone accumulated more metals and nutrients than controls, whereas plant tissue treated with <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil on the leaves contained only elevated levels of aluminum, although levels were still within reasonable concentrations for plants. Germination of seeds was not affected below 1 % <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil in soil; however higher concentrations of <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil decreased percent germination. Addition of chloride to soil also inhibits germination, but addition of aluminum has no effect on germination percentage. Corn germination was restored in <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil leached with 200 mm artificial rainwater. The results of this research contribute information regarding the potential impact of <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil from static <b>test</b> <b>fires</b> on crop production. Test fire soil inhibits germination and growth if deposited in the root zone, and even foliar application alters tissue composition. However, plant composition is not altered significantly in terms of feed criteria, and germination can be restored by irrigating the TFS. The effects of <b>test</b> <b>fire</b> soil are attributed to high levels of chloride that induce salt stress. Crop damage may be avoided by conducting static <b>test</b> <b>fires</b> after crops are harvested or providing extra irrigation to soil impacted with the TFS...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the overall approach at JPL in performing spacecraft pyrotechnic shock qualification testing. Initially, the assembly shock requirements are developed {{early in the}} program based on previous spacecraft test experience and data. Pyrotechnic device <b>development</b> <b>testing</b> firings and spacecraft Development Test Model (DTM) pyro firings are then conducted to verify {{the adequacy of the}} assembly shock requirements and to determine the subsystem <b>test</b> <b>firing</b> and the subsequent system level <b>test</b> <b>firing</b> requirements. The electro-dynamic shaker, through shock synthesis techniques, is utilized to qualify the shock sensitive flight equipment with margins applied. Actual pyrotechnic device firings on spacecraft equipment or science instruments are performed when the influence of the pyros is localized and can be ignored at the system level. Full spacecraft system level shock tests, which include multiple firings of certain critical pyro devices, are conducted to verify the spacecraft design structural integrity and functions as well as to qualify hardware items which have not been previously qualified. These tests also provide a source of data from which assembly level requirements can be evaluated and compared. For example, during the Galileo program, the results demonstrated that good agreement between predicted and measured shock environments and adequate qualification of the flight spacecraft was achieved...|$|R

For some engines, the engine's gas generator and LOX dome were also flushed with TCE prior to <b>test</b> <b>firing.</b> [...] The F-1 rocket engine had its LOX dome, gas generator, and thrust chamber fuel jacket flushed with TCE during launch preparations.|$|R

40|$|The {{flow field}} {{in the region of}} a solid rocket motor field joint is very {{important}} since fluid dynamic and mechanical propellant stresses can couple to cause a motor failure at a joint. Presented here is an examination of the flow {{field in the}} region of the Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM) field joints. The analyses were performed as a first step in assessing the design of the ASRM forward and aft field joints in order to assure the proper operation of the motor prior to further <b>development</b> of <b>test</b> <b>firing.</b> The analyses presented here were performed by employing a two-dimensional axisymmetric assumption. Fluent/BFC, a three dimensional full Navier-Stokes flow field code, was used to make the numerical calculations. This code utilizes a staggered grid formulation along with the SIMPLER numerical algorithm. Wall functions are used to determine the character of the laminar sublayer, and a standard kappa-epsilon turbulence model is used to close the fluid dynamic equations. The analyses performed to this date verify that the ASRM field joint design operates properly. The fluid dynamic stresses at the field joints are small due to the inherent design of the field joints. A problem observed in some other solid rocket motors is that large fluid dynamic stresses are generated at the motor joint on the downstream propellant grain due to forward facing step geometries. The design of the ASRM field joints are such {{that this is not a}} problem as shown by the analyses. Also, the analyses of the inhibitor stub left protruding into the port flow from normal propellant burn back show that more information is necessary to complete these analyses. These analyses were performed as parametric analyses in relation to the height of the inhibitor stub left protruding into the motor port. A better estimate of the amount of the inhibitor stub remaining at later burn times must be determined since the height which the inhibitor stub protrudes into the port flow drastically affects the fluid dynamics induced stresses on the propellant grain at the field joints...|$|R
