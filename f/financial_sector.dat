This time, rather than being intended {{as a means to}} boost competitiveness, some states, especially Japan and the Eurozone, may be motivated to devalue their currencies as a means to counter the threat of deflation.

5|$|On {{moving into}} , Thatcher {{introduced}} {{a series of}} political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain's struggles {{in the wake of the}} Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the <b>financial</b> <b>sector),</b> flexible labour markets, the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Thatcher's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and increasing unemployment, until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her decisive re-election in 1983. She survived an assassination attempt in 1984.|$|E

5|$|A Peronist, Kirchner handled {{political}} power as Peronist leaders have traditionally done. He nevertheless sought to portray himself as being different from previous Peronist leaders. He made {{frequent use of}} controversies with other political or social forces and the polarization of public opinion, which became characteristic of his political style. This strategy was used against the <b>financial</b> <b>sector,</b> the military and police, foreign countries, international bodies, newspapers, and Duhalde himself {{with varying degrees of}} success. Kirchner sought to generate an image contrasting with those of former presidents Carlos Menem and Fernando de la Rúa. Menem was seen as frivolous and De la Rúa as doubtful, so Kirchner tried to be seen as serious and determined.|$|E

The borough's securities industry, enumerating 163,400 jobs in August 2013, continues to form the largest segment of the city's <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> and an important economic engine for Manhattan, accounting in 2012 for 5 percent of private sector jobs in New York City, 8.5 percent (US$3.8 billion) of the city's tax revenue, and 22 percent of the city's total wages, including an average salary of US$360,700. Wall Street investment banking fees in 2012 totaled approximately US$40 billion, while in 2013, senior New York City bank officers who manage risk and compliance functions earned as much as US$324,000 annually.|$|E
5|$|The root of {{the trouble}} was an {{economic}} crisis—initiated by the Panic of 1837—which was entering its sixth year in 1842. A speculative bubble had burst in 1836–39, causing a collapse of the <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> and a subsequent depression. The country became deeply divided over the best response to the crisis. Conditions got even worse in early 1842 because a deadline was looming. A decade earlier, when the economy was strong, Congress had promised Southern states {{that there would be}} a reduction in hated federal tariffs. Northern states welcomed tariffs, which protected their infant industries. But the South had no industrial base and depended on open access to British markets for their cotton. In a recommendation to Congress, Tyler lamented that it would be necessary to override the Compromise Tariff of 1833 and raise rates beyond the 20 percent limit. Under the previous deal, this would suspend the distribution program, with all revenues going to the federal government.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Yeap Wai Kong v. Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd. (2012), the High Court {{identified}} various factors {{to determine if the}} decision by Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd. ("SGX-ST") to reprimand a director of a company listed on the Singapore Exchange was properly characterized as a public function. These factors include {{the extent to which the}} SGX-ST is interwoven into the legislative and regulatory matrix, whether the reprimand function has a statutory underpinning, and the nature of the reprimand function. Even though the SGX-ST is not a statutory board, it is an approved exchange under section16 of the Securities and Futures Act, which provides that it must take into account the interests of both the investing and general public when discharging its obligations. Also, SGX-ST is a vital part of the institutional ecosystem of Singapore's <b>financial</b> <b>sector.</b> Its function to publicly reprimand a listed company's director may potentially result in adverse implications on the company's business reputation and the director's continued service on board committees and directorships of other listed companies. For these reasons, the nature test was satisfied.|$|E

40|$|Since China {{formally}} {{launched its}} anti-money laundering (AML) {{campaign in the}} early 2000 s, additional challenges and higher standards are faced by both Chinese AML regulators and regulated entities, and the national scope of combating money laundering (ML) has been expanded. With banks, securities, and insurance industries being the main battlefield, research on AML implementation in Chinese <b>financial</b> <b>sectors</b> is extremely significant since AML experience from the <b>financial</b> <b>sectors</b> will be a useful and important reference for non-financial industries. The {{first part of this}} thesis critically examined the soundness and effectiveness of AML regulation and compliance in China, and the factors which have increased AML effectiveness in Chinese financial institutions. The second part explored possible ways to enhance existing AML implementation in Chinese <b>financial</b> <b>sectors.</b> The thesis examined the most serious issues related to ML with clearly Chinese characteristics, namely, the underground or informal banking system, corruption-related ML, international 2 ̆ 7 hot 2 ̆ 7 money and private loans, and suggests ways to optimise efforts in Chinese <b>financial</b> <b>sectors</b> to address these problems. The thesis indicates that there are significant gaps in the understanding and analysis of the hidden reasons for ineffective compliance with AML program in Chinese <b>financial</b> <b>sectors,</b> including economic, political, legal, and cultural reasons. The thesis also examines the problems that are encountered in existing AML implementation in Chinese <b>financial</b> <b>sectors.</b> In addition, this thesis analysed the ML risks and vulnerabilities in Chinese banking, securities, and insurance sectors, and emphasises the synergistic relationship between ML risk-rating systems and enterprise-wide AML information programs to help determine and analyse the ML vulnerability of the Chinese <b>financial</b> <b>sectors.</b> The thesis concludes that there are significant gaps in the understanding and analysis of ML risk management in Chinese financial institutions. The third aim of this thesis was to compare the traditional rule-based AML approach and the latest risk-based AML approach, to determine the most appropriate way to translate the risk-based AML approach into the Chinese reality. Findings indicate that China has yet to reach a stage at which it is able to adopt a full risk-based approach (RBA) to AML compliance. This thesis designed a strategy map of a 2 ̆ 7 rule-based but risk-oriented 2 ̆ 7 AML approach (or partial RBA) applicable to Chinese <b>financial</b> <b>sectors</b> given their current stage of development. It suggests that only the adoption of this approach can provide an effective transition towards future implementation of a full RBA in China. The author believes that the findings of this thesis present very practical applications that could contribute positively {{to the development of a}} more effective AML regime and to the implementation of AML preventive measures in Chinese <b>financial</b> <b>sectors...</b>|$|R

5|$|Montreal {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the finance industry. The sector employs approximately 100,000 people in the Greater Montreal Area. As of March 2016, Montreal is ranked in the 21st position in the Global Financial Centres Index, a ranking of the competitiveness of financial centres around the world. The city is home to the Montreal Exchange, the oldest stock exchange in Canada and the only financial derivatives exchange in the country. The corporate headquarters of the Bank of Montreal and Royal Bank of Canada, two of the biggest banks in Canada, were in Montreal. While both banks moved their headquarters to Toronto, Ontario, their legal corporate offices remain in Montreal. The city is home to head offices of two smaller banks, National Bank of Canada and Laurentian Bank of Canada. The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, an instutitonal investor managing assets totalling $248billion CAD, has its main business office in Montreal. Many foreign subsidiaries operating in the <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> also have offices in Montreal, including HSBC, Aon, Société Générale, BNP Paribas and AXA.|$|E
5|$|The IFC {{is governed}} by its Board of Governors which meets {{annually}} and consists of one governor per member country (most often the country's finance minister or treasury secretary). Each member typically appoints one governor and also one alternate. Although corporate authority rests with the Board of Governors, the governors delegate most of their corporate powers and their authority over daily matters such as lending and business operations to the Board of Directors. The IFC's Board of Directors consists of 25 executive directors who meet regularly and work at the IFC's headquarters, and is chaired by the President of the World Bank Group. The executive directors collectively represent all 184 member countries. When the IFC's Board of Directors votes on matters brought before it, each executive director's vote is weighted according to the total share capital of the member countries represented by that director. The IFC's Executive Vice President and CEO oversees its overall direction and daily operations. As of October 2012, Jin-Yong Cai serves as the Executive Vice President and CEO of the IFC. President of the World Bank Group Jim Yong Kim appointed Jin-Yong Cai {{to serve as the}} new Executive Vice President and CEO of the IFC. Cai is a Chinese citizen who formerly served as a managing director for Goldman Sachs and has over 20 years of <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> experience.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the chairman, Lord Alexander of Weedon, {{announced}} a merger with Legal & General {{in a friendly}} £10.7billion deal, the first between a bank and an insurance company in UK history. The move was poorly received in the London financial markets and NatWest's share price fell substantially. Seen as a driver of the ill-advised investment banking expansion, Derek Wanless {{was forced to resign}} as chief executive following the appointment of Sir David Rowland (who became executive chairman). Also in 1999, in response to the much reduced NatWest market capitalisation, the much smaller Bank of Scotland made a hostile takeover bid for NatWest. The Bank of Scotland's aim was to break up the NatWest Group and dispose of its non-retail assets. NatWest was forced to abandon its merger, but refused to agree to a takeover by a rival bank. The Royal Bank of Scotland tabled another hostile offer and trumped the Bank of Scotland with a £21billion bid. The takeover of NatWest in early 2000 was the biggest in UK history. National Westminster Bank, once Britain's most profitable bank, was delisted from the London Stock Exchange and became, with its subsidiaries, component parts of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group. The outcome of this bitter struggle set the tone for a round of consolidation in the <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> as it prepared for a new age of fierce global competition. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group became the second largest bank in the UK and Europe (after HSBC) and the fifth largest in the world by market capitalisation. According to Forbes Global 2000, it was then the 13th largest company in the world. NatWest was retained as a distinct brand with its own banking licence, but many back office functions were merged with those of the Royal Bank, leading to over 18,000 job losses.|$|E

5|$|Under Protocol 3, Jersey {{is part of}} the European Union Customs Union of the European Community. The common customs tariff, levies {{and other}} {{agricultural}} import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States. There is free movement of goods and trade between the island and Member States. EU rules on freedom of movement for workers do not apply in Jersey. However, Article 4 of the Protocol requires the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that {{the scope of this article}} included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable. The island is therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister have attempted to argue, namely that the island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The French blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out. As a result, Jersey is not part of the single market in financial services. It is not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as movement of capital, company law or money laundering. However, the island's close proximity (135km south) and its close association with the <b>financial</b> <b>sector</b> of the U.K. has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several mainline publications (e.g., The Wall Street Journal) labelling the island a tax haven.|$|E
