30|$|This {{contribution}} {{addresses the}} relationships between the structure and gas transport properties of nanoporous thermostable cyanate ester resins (CERs) derived from polycyclotrimerization of 1, 1 ′-bis(4 -cyanatophenyl)ethane in the presence of 30 or 50  wt% of inert high-boiling temperature porogens (i.e., dimethyl- or <b>dibutyl</b> <b>phthalates),</b> followed by their quantitative removal. The nanopores in the films obtained were generated via a chemically induced phase separation route with further porogen extraction from the densely crosslinked CERs. To ensure a total desorption of the porogen moieties from the networks, an additional short-term thermal annealing at 250  °C was performed. The structure and morphology of such nanoporous CER-based films were investigated by FTIR and SEM techniques, respectively. Further, the gas transport properties of CER films were analyzed after the different processing steps, and relationships between the material structure and the main gas transport parameters were established.|$|R

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of phthalate esters (PAEs) in Chinese hospitals were investigated by simultaneously determining {{concentrations of}} gas- and particle-phase PAEs. PAEs were detected in two third-class first-grade hospitals, two second-class first-grade hospitals, {{and a community}} health service center. Hospital drugstores had the highest concentration (24. 19 mu g/m(3)), which was 1. 54 times that of newly decorated houses. The second highest concentration {{was found in the}} transfusion rooms, averaging 21. 89 mu g/m(3); this was followed by the concentrations of PAEs in the nurse&# 39;s workstations, the wards, and the doctor&# 39;s offices, with mean concentrations of 20. 66, 20. 0, and 16. 92 mu g/m(3), respectively. The lowest concentrations were found in the hallways (16. 30 mu g/m(3)). Of the six different kinds of PAEs found, major pollutants included diethyl <b>phthalates,</b> <b>dibutyl</b> <b>phthalates,</b> butylbenzyl phthalates and di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalates, comprising more than 80 % of all PAEs present. Meanwhile, a comparison between different wards showed that PAE concentrations in the maternity wards were 1. 63 times higher than in the main wards. Based on known health hazards, our results suggest that the PAEs seriously influence the health of the pregnant women and babies; therefore, it is of great importance to take the phthalate concentrations in hospitals into consideration. In addition, hospital indoor air was more seriously contaminated than the air of newly decorated houses. (C) 2015 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

30|$|Recently, we have {{reported}} on several novel approaches for producing mesoporous thin film CER samples via selective alkaline hydrolysis [19] or partial extraction [20] of reactive poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) sub-chains from CER/PCL hybrid networks. We also successfully created nanoporous CER-based networks via irradiation of thin films by α-particles, followed by chemical track etching [21]. Lately, {{we have developed}} a simple method for generating nanoporous film materials based on CERs by varying the rate and degree of completion of curing associated with the polycyclotrimerization of dicyanate monomer. A series of nanoporous CER films obtained by such incomplete conversion technique were thus synthesized [22]. We have also implemented a chemically induced phase separation route toward the formation of nanoporous pure CER networks by using inert high-boiling temperature porogens, e.g., dimethyl- and <b>dibutyl</b> <b>phthalates,</b> during network formation, followed by their quantitative removal [23]. Later on, we have enlarged the concentration range and the phthalate nature used for pore generation [24, 25]. Moreover, we have found relevant effects of porogen molecules trapped inside the crosslinked CER matrices after pore generation procedure on both structure and physico-chemical characteristics of the resulting porous CER-based film materials [24, 25].|$|R

40|$|A {{spectrum}} of reproductive system anomalies (cryptorchidism, hypospadias, dysgenesis of Wolffian duct-derived tissues and prostate, and reduced sperm production) in male rats exposed in utero to phthalate esters (PEs) {{are thought to}} be caused by PE inhibition of fetal testosterone production. Recently, <b>dibutyl</b> and dipentyl <b>phthalate</b> (DBuP, DPnP) were shown to disrupt the retinol signaling pathway (RSP) in mouse pluripotent P 19 embryonal carcinoma cells in vitro. The RSP regulates the synthesis and cellular levels of retinoic acid (RA), the active metabolite of retinol (vitamin A). In this new study, a total of 26 di- and mono-esters were screened to identify additional phthalate structures that disrupt the RSP and explore their mechanisms of action. The most potent PEs, those causing > 50 % inhibition, contained aryl and cycloalkane groups or C 4 -C 6 alkyl ester chains and were the same PEs reported to cause malformations in utero. They shared similar lipid solubility; logP values were between 4 and 6 and, except for PEs with butyl and phenyl groups, were stable for prolonged periods in culture. Mono- and cognate di-esters varied in ability to disrupt the RSP; e. g., DEHP was inactive but its monoester was active while DBuP was active yet its monoester was inactive. DBuP and dibenzyl phthalate both disrupted the synthesis of RA from retinol but not the ability of RA to activate gene transcription. Both PEs also disrupted the RSP in C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 multipotent mesenchymal stem cells. Based on this in vitro study showing that some PEs disrupt retinol signaling and previous in vivo studies that vitamin A/RA deficiency and PEs both cause strikingly similar anomalies in the male rat reproductive system, we propose that PE-mediated inhibition of testosterone and RA synthesis in utero are both causes of malformations in male rat offspring...|$|R
