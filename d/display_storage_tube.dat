50|$|Some {{pioneering}} <b>storage</b> <b>tube</b> <b>displays</b> were MIT Project MAC's ARDS (Advanced Remote Display Station), the Computek 400 Series Display terminals (a commercial derivative), {{which both}} used a Tektronix type 611 <b>storage</b> <b>display</b> unit, and Tektronix's 4014 terminal, the latter becoming {{a de facto}} computer terminal standard some time after its introduction (later being emulated by other systems due to this status).|$|R
5000|$|Generally speaking, <b>storage</b> <b>tubes</b> {{could be}} divided into two categories. In the more common category, they were only capable of storing [...] "binary" [...] images; any given point on the screen was either {{illuminated}} or dark. The Tektronix Direct-View Bistable <b>Storage</b> <b>Tube</b> was perhaps the best example in this category. Other <b>storage</b> <b>tubes</b> were able to store greyscale/halftoned images; the tradeoff was usually a much-reduced storage time.|$|R
40|$|The Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) Canister Storage Building (CSB) is {{the interim}} storage {{facility}} for the K-Basin SNF at the US. Department of Energy (DOE) Hanford Site. The SNF is packaged in multi-canister overpacks (MCOs). The MCOs are placed inside transport casks, then {{delivered to the}} service station inside the CSB. At the service station, the MCO handling machine (MHM) moves the MCO from the cask to a <b>storage</b> <b>tube</b> or one of two sample/weld stations. There are 220 standard <b>storage</b> <b>tubes</b> and six overpack <b>storage</b> <b>tubes</b> in a below grade reinforced concrete vault. Each <b>storage</b> <b>tube</b> can hold two MCOs...|$|R
50|$|The first {{generalized}} {{computer assisted}} instruction system, PLATO I, c. 1960 on ILLIAC I, used a <b>storage</b> <b>tube</b> as its computer graphics display. PLATO II and PLATO III also used <b>storage</b> <b>tubes</b> as <b>displays.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{investigate}} the potential for damage to the multi-canister overpack (MCO) during impact from an eccentric accidental drop onto the standard <b>storage</b> <b>tube,</b> overpack <b>storage</b> <b>tube,</b> service station or sampling/weld station. Damage to the <b>storage</b> <b>tube</b> and sample/weld station {{is beyond the scope}} of this report. The results of this analysis are required to show the following: (1) If a breach resulting in unacceptable release of contamination could occur in the MCO. (2) If the dropped MCO could become stuck in the <b>storage</b> <b>tube</b> after the drop. (3) Maximum deceleration of the spent nuclear fuel baskets. The model appropriate for the standard <b>storage</b> <b>tubes</b> with the smaller gap is the basis for the analysis and results reported herein in this SNF- 5204, revision 2 report. Revision 1 of this report is based on a model that includes the larger gap appropriate for the overpack tubes...|$|R

The resulting image was visible in the continuously glowing patterns {{on the face of}} the CRT.|$|R

40|$|An {{electrostatic}} {{camera system}} is discussed {{which is based}} on the electrostatic <b>storage</b> <b>tube.</b> The development of the system was begun following a series of experiments which indicated that the device offers signficantly improved performance over currently available devices. The approach used in developing the high performance camera involves: converting the input image to an electron image at low loss, applying a low noise gain process, and storing the resulting charge pattern in a low-loss target. The basic processes and elements of the electrostatic <b>storage</b> <b>tube</b> are illustrated and discussed. Graphs that depict the camera performance characteristics are included...|$|R
50|$|Some refresh vector {{displays}} use {{a normal}} phosphor that fades rapidly and needs constant refreshing 30-40 times per second {{to show a}} stable image. These displays such as the Imlac PDS-1 require some local refresh memory to hold the vector endpoint data. Other <b>storage</b> <b>tube</b> <b>displays</b> such as the popular Tektronix 4010 use a special phosphor that continues glowing for many minutes. <b>Storage</b> <b>displays</b> do not require any local memory. In the 1970s, both types of vector displays were much more affordable than bitmap raster graphics displays when megapixel computer memory was still very expensive. Today, raster displays have replaced nearly all uses of vector displays.|$|R
50|$|<b>Storage</b> <b>tubes</b> made a {{comeback}} in the 1960s and 1970s {{for use in}} computer graphics, most notably the Tektronix 4010 series. Today they are obsolete, their functions provided by low-cost memory devices and liquid crystal displays.|$|R
25|$|Where {{a single}} brief event is {{monitored}} by an oscilloscope, {{such an event}} will be displayed by a conventional tube only while it actually occurs. The use of a long persistence phosphor may allow the image to be observed after the event, {{but only for a}} few seconds at best. This limitation can be overcome by the use of a direct view <b>storage</b> cathode ray <b>tube</b> (<b>storage</b> <b>tube).</b> A <b>storage</b> <b>tube</b> will continue to display the event after it has occurred until such time as it is erased. A <b>storage</b> <b>tube</b> is similar to a conventional tube except that it is equipped with a metal grid coated with a dielectric layer located immediately behind the phosphor screen. An externally applied voltage to the mesh initially ensures that the whole mesh is at a constant potential. This mesh is constantly exposed to a low velocity electron beam from a 'flood gun' which operates independently of the main gun. This flood gun is not deflected like the main gun but constantly 'illuminates' the whole of the storage mesh. The initial charge on the storage mesh is such as to repel the electrons from the flood gun which are prevented from striking the phosphor screen.|$|R
5000|$|These two {{effects were}} both {{utilized}} {{in the construction}} of a <b>storage</b> <b>tube.</b> <b>Storage</b> was accomplished by striking any suitably long-lived phosphor with electrons with energies just above , and erased by striking them with electrons above [...] There were any number of varieties of mechanical layouts used to improve focus or cause the image to be refreshed either internally to the tube or through off board storage.|$|R
50|$|Chashaku (茶杓, tea scoops); {{also called}} tea spoon, {{are used to}} {{transfer}} the powdered tea from the tea container (chaki) to the tea bowl (chawan). Usually they are made of a narrow, thin piece of bamboo, although there are also those of wood or ivory. They are generally about 18 cm in length. The original ones imported to Japan from China were ivory. Tea masters in Japan have traditionally carved their own bamboo chashaku, providing them with a bamboo <b>storage</b> <b>tube</b> (tsutsu) {{as well as a}} poetic name (mei 銘) that will often be inscribed on the <b>storage</b> <b>tube.</b> The selection of the chashaku for use at a chanoyu gathering will largely depend on its poetic name.|$|R
50|$|A {{specialized}} type of <b>storage</b> <b>tube,</b> the Williams tube, {{was used}} as a main memory system on a number of early computers, from the late 1940s into the early 1950s. They were replaced with other technologies, notably core memory, starting in the 1950s.|$|R

50|$|Tektronix {{decided to}} enter the {{terminal}} market themselves, introducing the 4002 in 1969, and the updated 4002A in 1971. The latter sold for $9,400 in 1973, or $9,550 with a customized host adaptor. These were similar to the earlier 3rd party terminals, essentially combining one of their <b>storage</b> <b>tubes</b> with the circuitry needed to decode instructions from the host and turn those into control inputs. However, the 4002s had the unique feature that {{only a portion of}} the screen was a <b>storage</b> <b>tube,</b> with a small section set aside for normal refresh-based drawing. This area was used for status messages and entering commands. As they did not include raster scan hardware or any form of memory, refreshing this area rapidly enough to reduce flicker was up to the host computer.|$|R
