40|$|In Rational Beliefs Equilibria {{money is}} generically non-neutral. Given the expectational {{perspective}} {{proposed by the}} Theory of Rational Belief Equilibrium, we show {{that one of the}} most important factors in the emergence of money non-neutrality is played by Endogenous Uncertainty. This, in contrast to the Rational Expectations results of money neutrality and policy ineffectiveness, leads to a scenario in which monetary policy has an impact on the real economy and price volatility. The heterogeneity of beliefs together with the distribution and intensity of agents' states of optimism/pessimism can amplify the real effect of monetary policy and/or generate endogenous fluctuations in the economy which are not explained by any exogenous shock.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of dissociative {{phenomena}} and depression on the efficacy of prolonged exposure treatment in 71 patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Diagnoses, comorbidity, pretreatment depressive symptoms, PTSD symptom severity, and dissociative phenomena (trait dissociation, numbing, and depersonalization) were assessed at pretreatment using semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. In a pretreatment behavioral exposure test, patients were imaginally exposed to (part of) their trauma memory for 9 min, during which subjective fear was assessed. At posttreatment and 6 months follow-up PTSD, depressive and dissociative symptoms were again assessed in the completers (n = 60). Pretreatment levels of dissociative and depressive symptoms were similar in dropouts and completers {{and none of the}} dissociative phenomena nor depression predicted improvement. Against <b>expectations,</b> dissociative <b>phenomena</b> and depression were associated with enhanced rather than impeded fear activation during the behavioral exposure test. However, these effects disappeared after controlling for initial PTSD severity. Hence, rather than supporting contraindication, the current results imply that patients presenting with even severe dissociative or depressive symptoms may profit similarly from exposure treatment as do patients with minimal dissociative or depressive symptoms...|$|R

Although {{the quality of the}} underlying data limits the precision of the estimates, the present paper aims at analysing the fundamental factors behind these evolutions. The analysis presented here assesses whether the observed price dynamics may be attributed to a pure <b>expectation</b> bubble <b>phenomenon</b> or to the large changes in financial and demographic factors. This is done by means of a structural model of the demand and supply sides of the housing market with an error-correction process. When taking into account a standard set of macroeconomic variables, our estimates imply that residential property prices in France and Spain were approximately 20 % above the level explained by their fundamentals. When demographic and financial factors such as the borrowing capacity are taken on board, the degree of overvaluation is drastically reduced. The adjustment path to equilibrium is slightly faster in France than in Spain, but both countries display significant downward rigidity in prices.

40|$|The {{concentration}} of measure phenomenon may {{be summarized as}} follows: a function of many weakly dependent random variables that is not too sensitive to any of its individual arguments will tend to take values very close to its <b>expectation.</b> This <b>phenomenon</b> is most completely understood when the arguments are mutually independent random variables, and there exist several powerful complementary methods for proving concentration inequalities, such as the martingale method, the entropy method, and the method of transportation inequalities. The setting of dependent arguments is much less well understood. This chapter focuses on the martingale method for deriving concentration inequalities without independence assumptions. In particular, we use the machinery of so-called Wasserstein matrices {{to show that the}} Azuma-Hoeffding concentration inequality for martingales with almost surely bounded differences, when applied in a sufficiently abstract setting, is powerful enough to recover and sharpen several known concentration results for nonproduct measures. Wasserstein matrices provide a natural formalism for capturing the interplay between the metric and the probabilistic structures, which is fundamental to the concentration phenomenon.

40|$|This study {{includes}} the voices {{and experiences of}} fifteen Nepali women {{who participated in the}} activities provided at two Community Leaning Centres (CLCs). CLCs provide various learning activities for the women in rural Nepal, where education opportunities for adult women are extremely lacking. Situated within a postcolonial feminist perspective, this thesis aims to investigate not only the benefits of the CLCs for women per se but the construction of women’s agency through the learning using a combination of semi-structured interviews and a thematic data analysis. This study identifies the perceived benefits of women participants and analyses the processes by which women negotiate social constraints in their learning experiences, and the spaces of agency that have emerged therein. Each form of agency is classified into one of three groups - intrapersonal, relational and collective agency. This study particularly employs a post-colonial feminist lens to examine women’s experiences and their agency. Viewing the subjects through this lens suggests that there is no homogeneous "average Nepali woman" archetype; however, there are women who are active in their responses to gender-ascribed unfavourable structures within which they situate with different individual and collective strategies, motivations and <b>expectations.</b> This <b>phenomenon</b> challenges the moral and ethical imperatives of development inherent in development processes...|$|R

50|$|The {{nocebo effect}} {{is when a}} {{negative}} <b>expectation</b> of a <b>phenomenon</b> causes it {{to have a more}} negative effect than it otherwise would. A nocebo effect causes the perception that the phenomenon will have a negative outcome to actively influence the result. Mental states such as beliefs, expectations and anticipation can strongly influence the outcome of: disease; experience of pain; and even success of surgery. Positive expectations regarding a treatment can result in more positive outcomes and this effect is known as the placebo effect. Both placebo and nocebo effects are presumably psychogenic but also produce measurable physiological changes as well as changes in the brain, the body and behavior. For example, when a patient anticipates a side effect of a treatment, he/she can suffer them even if the medication provided is an inert substance. One article that reviewed 31 studies on nocebo effects reported a wide range of symptoms that could manifest as nocebo effects including nausea, stomach pains, itching, bloating, depression, sleep problems, loss of appetite, sexual dysfunction and severe hypotension.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the socialisation trajectory experienced by new entrants into nurse education. Specifically, it presents for consideration, the 'peri-entry' {{approach to the}} socialisation process. The 'peri-entry' approach is so called because it concentrates, both on the period prior to commencement, and after commencement. The approach covers three phases, the pre-entry phase, the entry/encounter phase, and the post-entry phase. The approach consists of four conceptual components, and these are located in its conceptual framework in the three phases. These conceptual components are; the pre-entry <b>expectation</b> formation <b>phenomenon,</b> Reality Shock, changing images of nursing, {{and changes in the}} individual's 'nursing' self-concept. The 'peri-entry' approach suggests that consideration be given to the possibility that reported changes in attitude and emotional states following entry may be due to expectations about the course, formed in the pre-entry period, not being matched by post entry experiences. These post-entry changes, the 'peri-entry' approach suggests, appear to occur in the dimensions of the four conceptual components. In order to examine the likelihood of this, the four dimensions of the approach are examined empirically by four studies, within the practitioner research philosophy. Each of the studies gave some measured support for the propositions made by the 'peri-entry' approach. Students did appear to hold inappropriate expectations on entry, there was evidence of Reality Shock, their images of nursing did become more negative, and their 'nursing' self-concept did grow progressively more positive. iii Recommendations were made as to the most appropriate ways to minimise any negative attitudes towards nursing, and nurse education, that students may develop. Also, suggestions for further research into socialisation in nurse education were made. These further studies, it is anticipated, may identify further possible aspects of socialisation that may also impinge on the educational lives of the students who choose to enter nursing as a career...|$|R

30|$|The {{proportion}} of drivers in total employees {{had a significant}} positive impact on total efficiency. This {{can be interpreted as}} meaning that a higher {{proportion of}} drivers means a lower proportion of administrative labour, which does not directly increase output and thereby the efficiency of the analysed urban transport systems. The proportion of drivers varied from 40 % to 70 %. The average age of rolling stock was also statistically significant and surprisingly increased efficiency. The correlation of the average age of rolling stock with the other variables was very small. This surprising result may have been caused {{by the fact that the}} investigated period was quite short. Companies with lower investments into new vehicles had lower expenses, but the increasing age of their fleet will cause problems (and lower their efficiency) later in future – due to not only more frequent vehicle repairs, but also due to environmental concerns which are gaining in importance. We tried to overcome this problem using different forms of investments by the companies, such as the investment rate, average investment per company, and ratios of investments to costs, line length, area, and population (always with only one “investment variable” per model). The estimated coefficient was positive, which means that companies with greater investments had higher efficiency scores. This is more in accordance with our <b>expectations.</b> However, this <b>phenomenon</b> was present only in some model specifications.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper was}} aimed at re-examining the problem {{surrounding}} the definition of philosophy as a discipline and the attempt to eliminate the historical challenges or dilemma that often accompany its definition over the years. From {{the point of view}} of what a thing does or the role it plays, we have its function. We are of the opinion that the practical role or function of a subject at any particular period gives it its definition. From this functional point of view, a task and definition of a thing are twin brothers. In this connection, a thing is what a thing does. That is, how it behaves or functions characterizes its nature. Thus, the function of philosophy at any historical period determines its definition at that period. Put in another way, the attempt by philosophy to solve some problems both social and natural, characterizes the discipline. With this background, we arrived at the conclusion that philosophy is not only a child of wonder (problems) but that each culture or historical period has its unique problem. Thus, the expectation a culture has for a philosophy is always relative to the problem of the period. This implies that the <b>expectation</b> of any <b>phenomenon</b> is akin to its function or characteristics. In the case of philosophy, its function aims at solving its cultural related problem. It admits no contradiction, therefore, to say that since every philosophy is culture (time and place) bound...|$|R

Possible applications of Mn 12 -acetate, e. g. for ultra high density magnetic information storage device, quantum computation, and magnetic molecular electronics, {{have been suggested}} due to the unusual magnetic behavior. It is an important prerequisite for the applications to develop a reliable technique to organize the molecules on a surface and to detect the magnetic signals of the molecules. A solution evaporation technique combined with conventional lithography is a simple but reliable method to create Mn 12 -acetate thin film patterns on the micro/nano-scale. The method is demonstrated {{with a series of}} analysis. A superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) shows a non-linear I-V (Current vs. Voltage) characteristic that is modulated by a magnetic flux inside the loop, allowing one to sense and analyze an extremely weak magnetic field.

Natural magic--a phrase used to express those phenomena which could be produced by a knowledge of the properties of matter--had so much in it that was apparently uncombined and uncertain, that the art of chemistry was accounted mystical, and an opinion prevailed that the results now known to be the consequence of laws of matter, could not be traced through their various combinations even by those who knew the effects themselves. Physical science, in a word, was cumbered by a number of fanciful and incorrect opinions, chiefly of a mystical character. If, for instance, it was observed that a flag and a fern never grew near each other, the circumstance was imputed to some antipathy between these vegetables; nor was it for some time resolved by the natural rule, that the flag has its nourishment in marshy ground, whereas the fern loves a deep dryish soil.

40|$|Pigment spread is {{the natural}} or {{experimentally}} procured (through grafting) progressive encroachment of pigmentation from black or red skin areas into juxtaposed white skin areas, or from black skin areas into red skin areas in spotted guinea pigs and other mammals. So far as spread from black into white skin is concerned, it had previously been shown that migration of epidermal melanocytes into skin lacking homologues of these cells was responsible. However, since red skin already has its own complement of phenotypically "red" melanocytes, the intriguing possibility remained that when black pigment encroaches upon red, rather than melanocyte migration being responsible, phaeomelanin (red) -producing melanocytes are transformed into eumelanin (black) -producing cells by some kind of serially transmissible factor derived from contiguous eumelanotic melanocytes. By utilizing two isogenic strains (Nos. 2 and 13) of spotted guinea pigs and their F 1 hybrids, the mechanism underlying the spread of pigment from black into red skin has been analyzed, employing cellular transplantation antigens as melanocyte "markers. " The findings demonstrate unequivocally that a physical migration of pigment cells is responsible. By comparing the extents of pigment spread from black ear skin grafts, or from epidermal cell suspensions prepared therefrom, from parental strain or from F 1 hybrid donors in white host skin areas of F 1 hybrid guinea pigs, it has been possible to evaluate {{the influence of the}} intimate contact of melanocytes with alien transplantation antigens on their survival and migratory behavior. No evidence was forthcoming that pigment spread takes place less readily when the cells responsible are confronted by epidermal cells bearing foreign antigens than when they are confronted by cells of their own antigenic constitution.

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{criticism and}} litigation against auditors has frequently {{been attributed to}} the existence of an expectations gap between the auditing profession and the public. An audit expectations gap is said to exist when there are differences in the beliefs of auditors and the public about the duties and responsibilities of auditors, and the meaning of messages conveyed by the audit report (Monroe & Woodliff, 1994). Researchers suggest that the gap is attributable to both unreasonable public expectations (the reasonableness gap) and inadequate auditor performance (the performance gap), whether due to deficient auditing standards (deficient standards gap) or substandard auditor performance (deficient performance gap) (Porter, 1993). Most prior studies have investigated the <b>expectations</b> gap <b>phenomenon</b> in a developed country context. This study extends the generalisability of prior studies by investigating whether a reasonableness expectations gap is evident in Sri Lanka -a developing country. In particular, the study determines whether significant differences can be observed between auditors and the other groups, with regards to the role, objectives, and limitations of an external audit, and the message(s) conveyed in the audit report. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka has asserted that an expectations gap does exist in Sri Lanka, and that unreasonable user expectations are primarily to blame. This study aims to provide evidence useful in assessing the validity of the claims of the Sri Lankan accounting profession. Further, the study investigates whether the extent of the reasonableness gap is influenced by level of audit sophistication (knowledge) amongst non-auditor subjects. A smaller reasonableness gap is expected to be associated with sophisticated groups (e. g., managers, accountants, bankers, lawyers) relative to less sophisticated groups (e. g., private shareholders and students). This study is not concerned with issues relating to the setting of audit regulations, adequacy of the standards or the performance of the audit profession, but with the communication and understanding of current regulations and the intended meaning of unqualified audit report. The data for the study are collected by means of a self-administered questionnaire, which comprised of semantic differential belief statements. The survey included auditors, students, bankers, lawyers and preparers of financial statements. The results confirmed the existence of an audit expectations gap in Sri Lanka and suggest that the degree of audit sophistication amongst non-auditors is associated with the degree of unreasonable audit expectations. The study found that differences in the perceptions of non auditors and auditors concerning the auditor's responsibilities for fraud detection and reporting; and the meaning of the unqualified audit report, were important determinants of the extent of the unreasonableness gap. Contributing somewhat less to the unreasonableness gap were differences in perceptions concerning the auditor's responsibility for maintaining accounting records and the view that an unqualified audit report assures that entity is being run efficiently...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate critical perspectives impacting on the role of leadership in secondary education. The research utilized qualitative methodology wherein literature included observation, interviews of members of the school governance, principals, education officials and members of the school management teams. The study formulated a research question which reflects the researcher’s <b>expectation</b> about the <b>phenomenon.</b> To what extent do leadership imperatives impinge on the functioning of secondary education in South Africa? The principals as public managers utilize the generic administrative functions to execute their duties in secondary schools. The administrative functions are policy making, staffing, and determination of work procedures, financing, organizing and other management functions. Staffing and financing in the Department of Basic Education are the competence of the principal. The respondents interviewed and literature study confirmed that the implementation of the generic administrative functions, namely staffing and policy making created problems. Challenges were experienced particularly when decisions had to be taken. Often the School Governing Body could not collectively agree on the recruitment of suitable teachers and also on making financial decisions. This impacted negatively on the role of principals. This trend was found to be prevalent in the schools with SGB’s who lacked governance skills. The study has made recommendations that will help the Department of Basic Education to address school governance. The research recommended that the school governing body members should be trained on staffing, finance and policy making. The principals as members of the school governing body should also be trained on the above mentioned aspects. The empowerment of staffing is very important as the schools require teachers who are well qualified to teach learners according to National Curriculum Assessment Policy Statement (NCAPS) requirements. It is important that the parents on the SGB work cooperatively with the principals so that the school can be staffed by well qualified personnel. It is also vital that money received from the state is used effectively, efficiently and economically. To achieve this goal an intensive training on procurement is necessary. Policy making is an essential aspect and requires knowledgeable people to do it. The schools require policies which will provide the staff with guidelines.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{whether or}} not models that portray the {{relationship}} between what an investor learns and how he allocates his portfolio can explain phenomena related to household behaviour in the stock market. Endogenous modelling of household learning is utilised, which builds on a growing literature called bounded rationality with increasing explanatory power, offering {{an alternative to the}} classical rational <b>expectations</b> theory. Such <b>phenomena</b> include firstly why households often hold portfolios that are little diversified, secondly why household beliefs about the stock market exhibit widespread heterogeneity despite past data being publicly available and lastly {{whether or not}} they employ strategic motives in the stock market and whether they complement others’ actions or substitute them for their own. In particular, Paper 1 addresses the observation that a significant number of investors hold concentrated portfolios, apparently forgoing the benefits of diversification. In a static portfolio choice model with limited capacity constraints, Van Nieuwerburgh & Veldkamp (2010) show that the observed lack of diversification is rational amongst investors with a strong preference for an early resolution of uncertainty. This paper studies whether or not endogenous information acquisition can also rationalise the observed peculiarity within a dynamic portfolio choice model. It is found that in the steady state, a hedging demand component appears in the optimal portfolio, which attempts to spread risk across the investor’s investment horizon: The investor chooses additional information precision the smaller is the compensation for bearing risk. A numerical approximation to the agent’s decision rule suggests that the research question can be answered in the affirmative. This is for an investor who is indifferent to the time of uncertainty resolution and is risk averse over wealth. Paper 2 tackles the question “Is demand for information positively correlated with returns?” Results from this study indicate “no” in any permanent sense. Using a dynamic model of endogenous information acquisition and portfolio choice, simulations reveal that once an agent learns the underlying process behind returns, his demand for information is constant and hence acyclical. This is surprising given survey results found by Coibion et al (2015), which, along with the PATeR survey 2014 wave, document widespread heterogeneity in agent beliefs. Hence it appears that economic agents in reality do not treat returns as though they are driven by an underlying, learnable process. This paper contributes to literature on bounded rationality and limited processing of information. It also finds a rationale for belief heterogeneity: ignoring realised returns and observing signals that support prior beliefs allows degenerate distributions to emerge. This result can be produced under the assumption that the investor does not access public information. Lastly, the third paper addresses whether or not households behave strategically regarding each other when making stock market participation decisions. The study examines the contribution of strategic considerations in stock market return expectations on the demand for risky assets empirically, exploiting novel data from the 2014 PATeR survey wave, representative of the population by age and wealth. The strategy is to identify whether individual stockholding decisions are consistent with strategic substitutes or complements prevailing in the stock market, under the null hypothesis of efficiency. The study finds evidence for strategic complementarity and additional information variables can explain this effect. Given the substantial heterogeneity in expectations and perceptions of returns, and the relatively low degree of sophistication of the median investor identified in the empirical literature, the project concludes that as strategic substitutes prevail even amongst them, a portion of the excess volatility observed in stock markets may be driven by expectational motives in coordination...|$|R
40|$|This {{publication}} {{presents the}} results of the study of a corpus of relevant literature on communes and commune movements in Western society. The study is descriptive-analytical, and the communes analyzed belong partly to the past and partly to the present. The analysis was predominantly based upon some 40 descriptions of different communes or commune movements, the relevant characteristics of which are mentioned in an appendix. The social entities selected for this study had to satisfy the following criteria:- they had to be established in the now capitalist West;- they had to have an experimental character when established;- they had to embrace three or more socially autonomous members;- they should not reject per se sexuality, socialization, production/ consumption, and emotional- affective care as activities for their own group, but should rather aim at the fulfilment of at least one of these functions as an activity of the group as a whole;- they had to be territorial units;- their duration as a functioning whole should not have been determined in advance. The problem to be studied was threefold. The first question dealt with the profile of the communes in the now capitalist West. The answer to that question has been given in terms of motivation, membership, social characteristics of the members, selection, the functions of the group in a family sociological perspective (sexuality, procreation, etc.), structural aspects, duration, and causes of success or failure. On a motivational basis the communes and commune movements were classed into three main categories, viz. :I. religious communes (a. old religious communes; b. communes proceeding from convents/monasteries; c. communes originating from new religious movements);II. political communes (a. passive political communes; b active political communes);III. communes emphasizing interpersonal relations. Communes of type Ia were already established centuries ago, those of type II were not founded before the nineteenth century, while communes of type Ic and III are a phenomenon of the last decade. The foregoing suggests that the different types distinguished are fairly closely related to different socio-cultural epochs. However, one further conclusion deserves special mention, viz. that the contemporary commune attacks the family much more often on a broad front than the commune of the past. The second question pertains to the social background and the ideologies that stimulated commune formation. An attempt is made to analyse the relationship between developments in society and ideologies living in the communes. Regarding this relation, it appears that commune ideologies reflect in extreme form ideas and accents prevalant within society. Because communes (or the absence of commune formation) can be more or less considered as corollaries of societal development, the emphasis differed from era to era. Up to the present time, as a consequence of the extremity of the underlying ideas, commune formation has remained a marginal phenomenon. The third and last question bears on what might be expected of commune formation in the future. Despite the fact that elements of speculation are unavoidable in predicting social <b>phenomena,</b> <b>expectations</b> for each type of commune have been formulated both as regards the ultimate chances of success and future numerical occurrences. In formulating the expectations the following three points were considered: the inner strenght of a commune type (mainly the character and strength of motivation); structural support and resistance existing in contemporary Western society; and the ideological basis of the commune type in relation to existing and changing values in that society. The cautious expectations formulated via these starting-points pertain to each of the types as such (the religious commune in its three different forms, the two types of the political commune, and the commune emphasizing the improvement of interpersonal relations). The final chapter gives a survey of the existing commune studies and recommendations for further research...|$|R
