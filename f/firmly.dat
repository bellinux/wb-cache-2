5|$|There are <b>firmly</b> {{established}} {{chains of}} command, and the duties and capacity to coerce others to comply {{is described by}} regulation.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s the Army was <b>firmly</b> {{established}} in the surface-to-air missile field with their Nike and Nike B missile projects. These projects had been led by Bell Labs, working with Douglas.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Soviet military–industrial complex also opposed a test ban, {{though some}} scientists, {{including}} Igor Kurchatov, were supportive of antinuclear efforts. France, {{which was in}} the midst of developing its own nuclear weapon, also <b>firmly</b> opposed a test ban in the late 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Most {{accounts}} {{declare that}} Kanhopatra {{was forced into}} the courtesan's life, though she detested it, while some say that Kanhopatra <b>firmly</b> declined to become a courtesan. Some authors believe {{that she may have}} also worked as a prostitute.|$|E
5|$|Operation Florence {{had come}} to an end. While the German line had been pushed back and they had {{sustained}} casualties they could ill afford, they still <b>firmly</b> held Orsogna. Furthermore, the New Zealand Division was, for the time being, fought out and needed a period of consolidation and reorganisation.|$|E
5|$|Pratchett {{resisted}} {{mapping the}} Discworld {{for quite some}} time, noting that a <b>firmly</b> designed map restricts narrative possibility (i.e., with a map, fans would complain if he placed a building on the wrong street, but without one, he could adjust the geography to fit the story).|$|E
5|$|The Persian army then re-conquered the {{settlements}} on the Asian {{side of the}} Propontis, while the Persian fleet sailed up the European coast of the Hellespont, taking each settlement in turn. With all of Asia Minor now <b>firmly</b> returned to Persian rule, the revolt was finally over.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} syadvada allows the Jains {{to accept the}} truth in other philosophies from their perspectives, thus inculcating a {{tolerance}} for other viewpoints. Anekantvada is non-absolutist and stands <b>firmly</b> against all dogmatisms, even including any assertion that only Jainism is the right religious path.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{historian}} Petar Mutafchiev, {{after the battle}} Samuil was {{in control of the}} Balkans. According to some historians, the northeastern parts of the Bulgarian Empire were liberated in the years after the battle. However, according to other sources, they were liberated ten years prior to the battle, in 976. The Bulgarians <b>firmly</b> took the initiative and launched continuous attacks towards Thessaloniki, Edessa, and the Adriatic coast. The Serbs were also defeated and their state incorporated into Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{development of}} vector spaces {{is due to}} the construction of function spaces by Lebesgue. This was later formalized by Banach and Hilbert, around 1920. At that time, algebra and the new field of functional analysis began to interact, notably with key concepts such as spaces of p-integrable functions and Hilbert spaces. Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a <b>firmly</b> established notion, and many mathematical branches started making use of this concept.|$|E
5|$|Antibaryons are {{not listed}} in the tables; however, they simply would have all quarks changed to antiquarks, and Q, B, S, C, B′, would be of {{opposite}} signs. Particles with † next to their names have been predicted by the Standard Model but not yet observed. Values in red have not been <b>firmly</b> established by experiments, but are predicted by the quark model and {{are consistent with the}} measurements.|$|E
5|$|As Thebes {{began to}} take the upper hand, Mentuhotep II (c. 2061– c. 2010 BCE), on his {{campaign}} of reunification, brought Thinis, which had been in revolt, possibly at Heracleopolitan instigation and certainly {{with the support of}} an army under the command of the nomarch of Assyut, <b>firmly</b> under his control.|$|E
5|$|By 16:00, {{with the}} Franco-Bavarian troops besieged in Blenheim and Oberglau, the Allied centre of 81 squadrons (nine squadrons had been {{transferred}} from Cutts' column), supported by 18 battalions was <b>firmly</b> planted amidst the French line of 64 squadrons and nine battalions of raw recruits. There {{was now a}} pause in the battle: Marlborough wanted to concert the attack upon the whole front, and Eugene, after his second repulse, needed time to reorganize.|$|E
5|$|By 1778 Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele stated <b>firmly</b> that molybdena was (indeed) neither galena nor graphite. Instead, Scheele {{correctly}} {{proposed that}} molybdena was an ore of a distinct new element, named molybdenum for the mineral {{in which it}} resided, and from which it might be isolated. Peter Jacob Hjelm successfully isolated molybdenum using carbon and linseed oil in 1781.|$|E
5|$|Chrétien's {{position}} {{was far more}} difficult than Johnson's: Part of the 1993 Liberal election platform had been moving the country away from large scale constitutional debates. Provincial governments were also far more hostile to the constitutional process {{than they had been}} in the decade prior, with even the federal government's typical ally, Ontario, being <b>firmly</b> against any pursuit of constitutional accommodation.|$|E
5|$|Coenwulf was {{the last}} of a series of Mercian kings, {{beginning}} with Penda in the early 7th century, to exercise dominance over most or all of southern England. In the years after his death, Mercia's position weakened, and the battle of Ellendun in 825 <b>firmly</b> established Egbert of Wessex as the dominant king south of the Humber.|$|E
5|$|Despite the near-debacle, the {{commitment}} of the Sa'iqa, along with the paratroopers of the 85th Battalion, had actually reinforced Egyptian defenses and helped defeat the Israeli attack. The battle continued south of Lake Timsah in see-saw fashion, raging back and forth, but by nightfall on October 20 the Israelis had made no progress, and the Egyptian paratroopers were <b>firmly</b> in control of Touscan. According to Trevor N. Dupuy, by this time Israeli artillery fire had made the main Cairo-Ismailia road unusable.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} 1750–1761, British {{defeated}} the French East India company in India, and by 1793 they were <b>firmly</b> established in Bengal {{in the east}} and Madras in the south. They were unable to expand to the west as the Marathas were dominant there, but they entered Surat on the west coast via the sea.|$|E
5|$|Fatah {{dedicated}} {{itself to}} the liberation of Palestine by an armed struggle carried out by Palestinians themselves. This differed from other Palestinian political and guerrilla organizations, most of which <b>firmly</b> believed in a united Arab response. Arafat's organization never embraced the ideologies of the major Arab governments of the time, in contrast to other Palestinian factions, which often became satellites of nations such as Egypt, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria and others.|$|E
5|$|Grant, under protest, {{followed}} Johnson's order transferring Sheridan {{and another}} of the district commanders, Daniel Sickles, who had angered Johnson by <b>firmly</b> following Congress's plan. The President also issued a proclamation pardoning most Confederates, exempting those who held office under the Confederacy, or who had served in federal office before the war and had breached their oaths.|$|E
5|$|Having <b>firmly</b> {{assisted}} {{and supported}} {{her husband on}} his path to political greatness, she suddenly died in 1890, aged 39, leaving him, distraught and bereft of her support, to achieve the political destiny which she had plotted. His premiership of the United Kingdom was shambolic, and lasted barely a year. For over thirty years following her death, he wandered in a political wilderness, directionless and exceedingly eccentric, until his own death in 1929.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, {{following}} the disruption the group were experiencing, Shapira travelled to Europe once again. He hoped {{to secure the}} necessary firman, which would place the courtyard <b>firmly</b> in the Perushim's possession, and also to raise funds {{to cover the costs}} incurred trying to redeem the courtyard. His mission, however, was unsuccessful, as was a later mission attempted in 1829 by Zoref.|$|E
5|$|Instead, {{he took up}} a {{position}} with , Belgium's largest Francophone daily newspaper. Confiscated from its original owners, the German authorities had permitted Le Soir to be re-opened under the directorship of De Doncker, although it remained <b>firmly</b> under Nazi control, supporting the German war effort and espousing anti-Semitism. After joining the Le Soir team on 15 October, Hergé {{was involved in the}} creation of a children's supplement, Soir-Jeunesse, aided by Jamin and Jacques Van Melkebeke. He relaunched The Adventures of Tintin with a new story, The Crab with the Golden Claws, in which Tintin pursued drug smugglers in North Africa; the story was a turning point in the series for its introduction of Captain Haddock, who would become a major character in the rest of the Adventures. This story, like the subsequent Adventures of Tintin published in Le Soir, would reject the political themes present in earlier stories, instead remaining <b>firmly</b> neutral. Hergé also included new Quick & Flupke gags in the supplement, as well as illustrations for serialised stories by Edgar Allan Poe and the Brothers Grimm.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} when Roskilde became a market town but it was {{certainly}} enjoying trading privileges under King Eric II who reigned from 1134 to 1137. These privileges were <b>firmly</b> established when the Roskilde City Council granted market town status to other towns on Zealand on 15 June 1268. By that time, {{it was probably the}} largest and most important town in Denmark. In 1370, the city owned 2,600 farms throughout Zealand.|$|E
5|$|La Peau de chagrin <b>firmly</b> {{established}} Balzac as {{a writer}} of significance in France. His social circle widened significantly, and he was sought eagerly by publishers for future projects. The book served as the catalyst {{for a series of}} letters he exchanged with a Polish baroness named Ewelina Hańska, who later became his wife. It also inspired Giselher Klebe's opera Die tödlichen Wünsche.|$|E
5|$|Like all actinides, {{einsteinium}} {{is rather}} reactive. Its trivalent oxidation state is most stable in solids and aqueous solution where it induced pale pink color. The existence of divalent einsteinium is <b>firmly</b> established, especially in solid phase; such +2 {{state is not}} observed in many other actinides, including protactinium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium, curium and berkelium. Einsteinium(II) compounds can be obtained, for example, by reducing einsteinium(III) with samarium(II) chloride. The oxidation state +4 was postulated from vapor studies and is yet uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Anna's life or his reign, as few records have survived from this period. In 631 {{he may have been}} at Exning, close to the Devil's Dyke. In 645 Cenwalh of Wessex was driven from his kingdom by Penda and, due to Anna's influence, he was {{converted}} to Christianity while living as an exile at the East Anglian court. Upon his return from exile, Cenwalh re-established Christianity in his own kingdom and the people of Wessex then remained <b>firmly</b> Christian.|$|E
5|$|Ned is a {{genuinely}} well-meaning good-natured person {{and is one}} of the few in Springfield to whom that description applies. <b>Firmly</b> religious, he can be timid and something of a pushover. He is a Republican and a devout Evangelical Christian who strictly follows the Bible literally and is easily shocked when challenged on any point of dogma. This has led to his frequent calls to Reverend Lovejoy, who has become increasingly frustrated with and uninterested in Flanders.|$|E
5|$|Nothhelm {{oversaw the}} {{reorganisation}} of the Mercian dioceses {{which took place}} in 737. The archbishop consecrated Witta as Bishop of Lichfield and Totta as Bishop of Leicester. The diocese of Leicester was <b>firmly</b> established by this action, although earlier attempts had been made to establish a bishopric there. In 738, Nothhelm was a witness on the charter of Eadberht I, the King of Kent.|$|E
5|$|Once {{computational}} {{power was}} readily available, it became possible to easily design filters to minimise any arbitrary parameter, for example time delay or tolerance to component variation. The {{difficulties of the}} image method were <b>firmly</b> put in the past, and even the need for prototypes became largely superfluous. Furthermore, the advent of active filters eased the computation difficulty because sections could be isolated and iterative processes were not then generally necessary.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable events during the Anuradhapura Kingdom was the {{introduction}} of Buddhism to the country. A strong alliance existed between Devanampiya Tissa (250–210 BC) and Ashoka of India, who sent Arahat Mahinda, four monks, and a novice being sent to Sri Lanka. They encountered Devanampiya Tissa at Mihintale. After this meeting, Devanampiya Tissa embraced Buddhism the order of monks {{was established in the}} country. Devanampiya Tissa, guided by Arahat Mahinda, took steps to <b>firmly</b> establish Buddhism in the country.|$|E
5|$|Petre P. Panaitescu {{states that}} in Mihai's time, {{the concept of}} the Romanian nation and the desire for {{unification}} did not yet exist. A. D. Xenopol <b>firmly</b> states the absence of any national element in Michael's politics, holding that Michael's lack of desire to join the principalities' administrations proved his actions were not motivated by any such concept.|$|E
5|$|She {{is placed}} <b>firmly</b> in the imperialist {{literature}} of nineteenth-century England, and inspired by Rider Haggard's experiences of South Africa and British colonialism. The story expresses numerous racial and evolutionary {{conceptions of the}} late Victorians, especially notions of degeneration and racial decline prominent during the fin de siècle. In the figure of She, the novel notably explored themes of female authority and feminine behaviour. It has received praise and criticism alike for its representation of womanhood.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, scholars have debated whether El Greco's style had Byzantine origins. Certain art historians had asserted that El Greco's roots were <b>firmly</b> in the Byzantine tradition, and that his most individual characteristics derive directly from the art of his ancestors, while others had argued that Byzantine art could not be related to El Greco's later work.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} depictions of Jesus at the Dura-Europos church are <b>firmly</b> dated to before 256. Thereafter, {{despite the lack of}} biblical references or historical records, a wide range of depictions of Jesus appeared during the last two millennia, often influenced by cultural settings, political circumstances and theological contexts. As in other Early Christian art, {{the earliest}} depictions date to the late 2nd or early 3rd century, and surviving images are found especially in the Catacombs of Rome.|$|E
5|$|South of Highway407, {{planning}} for the controversial link to Morningside Avenue has been underway since 2002. Although York had intended for Donald Cousens Parkway to tie directly into Morningside, thus completing and arterial link the Highway401, Toronto has <b>firmly</b> opposed this direct link since 2005 due to the requirement for a new crossing of the Rouge River. After a lengthy and contentious debate between the two, the province brought in former York Region CAO Alan Wells as a mediator in 2007.|$|E
