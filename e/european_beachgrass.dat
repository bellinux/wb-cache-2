5000|$|Many of the lichens and flora {{that still}} {{thrive in the}} Lanphere Dunes are from an epoch that passed long ago, with {{reindeer}} lichens thriving well after the Ice Age. Varieties of flora often found in Lanphere Dunes that are typically common are often far away from their natural ranges. Sands that are blown in with the occasional ocean breezes remain trapped in the forests, killing off the trees and leaving behind [...] "skeleton forests," [...] areas where all the husks of former trees are plentiful. American Dunegrass (Leymus mollis) used to be plentiful, once found along the west coast as south as Morro Bay in California, this native grass now occurs in just two areas along the California coast, Point Reyes and the Lanphere Dunes. [...] <b>European</b> <b>Beachgrass</b> is an invasive species that {{was found to be}} omnipresent in the Lanphere Dunes, having taken over many of the areas formally occupied by native grasses. Between 1992 and 1997, <b>European</b> <b>Beachgrass</b> from the dune zone was manually removed by laborers from the California Conservation Corps funded by the Nature Conservancy. After starting the restoration project in 1992, native plant cover in Lanphere Dunes increased by 47% by the year 1997 without the assistance of active re-planting.|$|E

50|$|Ammophila arenaria is {{a species}} of grass known by the common names European marram grass and <b>European</b> <b>beachgrass.</b> It {{is one of two}} species of the genus Ammophila (marram grass). It is native to the coastlines of Europe and North Africa where it grows in the sands of beach dunes. It is a {{perennial}} grass forming stiff, hardy clumps of erect stems up to 1.2 m in height. It grows from a network of thick rhizomes which give it a sturdy anchor in its sand substrate and allow it to spread outward. These rhizomes can grow laterally by 2 metres (7 feet) in six months. One clump can produce 100 new shoots annually.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Natural Resource Planning and Interpretation, 2010 Invasive {{plants have}} had {{significant}} {{impacts on the}} dune ecosystem on the North Spit of Humboldt Bay, where they have modified ecological processes. A large area of these dunes lies adjacent to the community of Manila, including Friends of the Dunes??? Humboldt Coastal Nature Center, where restoration activities are under close public scrutiny. Management recommendations for the Humboldt Coastal Nature Center were identified through an analysis of key ecological processes: examination of vegetation succession using a Geographic Information System (GIS), mapping invasive plants and endangered plants with a Global Positioning System (GPS), investigating dune morphology with local experts, and gathering input from residents {{of the community of}} Manila on how they feel about restoration activities. Findings from the analysis show that the Humboldt Coastal Nature Center landscape went from being composed of 32. 4 ha of active coastal dunes in 1948 to having only 7. 9 ha of active coastal dunes in 2009. It appears that vegetation began stabilizing some of the active dune areas through natural succession between 1954 and 1970, and it is plausible that invasive plants, which covered 20. 7 ha by 2009, sped up the process of this stabilization. Along with the stabilization of the dunes, geomorphic processes have been impeded by <b>European</b> <b>beachgrass</b> invading the foredune which cuts off inland sand supply from the beach. The main concern from residents of the community of Manila was that restoration activities could compromise their safety, but investigation of geomorphic processes found that restoration activities could strengthen the community???s defense against storm waves and tsunamis. From these findings, management recommendations for the Humboldt Coastal Nature Center were compiled in a GIS. Management recommendations focused on restoring ecological processes and native vegetation across the entire property, and restoring geomorphic processes in the foredune area. Furthermore, recommendations suggested adaptive management strategies for dune management near human communities and identified areas of further research that will benefit coastal dune restoration efforts in the region and beyond...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} experiences {{presented here}} have been realised since 1994 owing to the ‘Conseil Général’ of the North district on the upper beaches of the Flemish dunes owned by the ‘Conservatoire du Littoral’ situated on the Bray-Dunes and Zuydcoote municipalities (France). This experience aims at {{the restoration of the}} habitats on the sea frontline of the border dune. The matter is the space that starts from the annual halo-nitrophilic strip on the upper beach, goes on with the embryo dune and finishes with the quick white dune dominated by the <b>European</b> <b>beachgrass</b> (marram). The requirements of beach cleanness, especially regarding seaside tourism, have led to the destruction of these patrimonial important habitats by the regular and complete mechanical raking of the strand. The first step consisted in limiting this mechanical raking to the rights of sea-side resorts. At the same time, the upper strip of the beach along dunes is managed softly by a selective manual picking up of the biggest trashes. This change of cleaning process rapidly produced the emergence of noticeable habitats that didn’t exist before. It concerns water marks mingled with sand and embryonic dunes with sand couch grass. To a reduced extent, these methods of management lead to a reinforcement of the white dune with marram and sand ryegrass and the white dune which is warmer with marram and sea spurge. Some of these habitats are listed as part of the Guideline ‘Habitat’ and are listed as vulnerable or endangered after the red book of the littoral terrestrial phytocoenoses according to the definitions proposed by the International Union for Nature Preservation. Moreover, the obstacles kept on the upper strip of the beach afford the start of a process of sand accumulation and build the embryonic dune. According to the sedimentary context, this type of operation assists the fertilisation of the upper beach and reduces the retreat phenomenon of the coastline. The cost of operations is much reduced, money is even saved with the reduction of the number of interventions. It was only difficult to convince our partners about modifying their cleaning habits. This successful experience over a 1. 5 km distance of beach, facing preserved dune massifs, shows the large potentialities of spontaneous restoration of these natural environments. The extreme simplicity of this method and its very small cost, except employment, allow us to envisage and adapt it all along the European coastline...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 A {{study of}} Ammophila, a,renaria (L.) Link, (<b>European</b> <b>beachgrass)</b> {{plantations}} {{was carried out}} on sand dunes along the Oregon coast to observe the vegetation changes which occur {{over a period of}} years. Control of moving sand has been important on a world-wide basis for many years. In Oregon this problem has been the cause of concern since the 1930 's. Ammophila is well adapted to the extreme environment of a coastal area and t is most vigorous in areas of drifting sand. It is a coarse, perennial grass used extensively in planting of sand dunes for stabilization. Ammop 1 i 1 a is the primary species used in the Oregon plantation work. Transplanting of the grass clones is the moat frequently used method of planting on the dunes. Clones are planted with varying density and number of culms per hill according to the direction and degree of the slope. The planting is carried out between November and April when weather is cool and wet. To insure permanent stabilization, secondary woody species are planted in the established Ammophila. The species used are Cytisus scoparius (Scotchbroom) and Pinus contorta (Lodgepole or shorepine). Cytius is planted before or concurrently with the Pinus to provide protection for the Pinus. Thirteen consecutive years of plantations were located and studied south of Florence, Oregon, where planting has been in progress since 1949. A 25 foot square plot was located in a uniform and typical area within the plantation. The plot was divided into five foot square quadrats with three foot square quadrats placed within each of these. Data included height, cover, diameter of clumps and density of Ammophila; height, cover and density of Pinus and Cytisus; cover of litter and Mnium sp. (moss); and frequency of the native species present in the plots. An analysis of sand determined the pH, total nitrogen and organic matter present. The plantations varied in overall appearance for the 13 years. Ammophila showed a definite change from the clumped growth form observed {{in the first years of}} growth after planting to solitary shoots present in the oldest plots observed. Pinus and Cytisus showed a varied appearance throughout the plots with a general increase in height and cover. Density varied with the degree of success of the plantings. Native species were present and the frequencies varied with plantation age and location. The soil analysis proved a definite decrease in pH with age of the plantation. The oldest plot observed showed numerous native species including. Picea sitchensis (Sitka Spruce). In time the areas now being planted will develop a typical native vegetation without any of the original planted species present...|$|E
