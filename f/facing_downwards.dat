5|$|Individuals {{are usually}} solitary, with a South-East Queensland study {{estimating}} densities of only 50 per hectare (compared {{to some other}} Australian species nearly two orders of magnitude more dense). The adult floury baker normally perches <b>facing</b> <b>downwards</b> and on branches of trees rather than trunks. It is found {{on a wide variety}} of plants, most commonly on species in the family Myrtaceae, more specifically various species of Melaleuca and Callistemon plants, as well as brown hazelwood (Lysicarpus angustifolius) and pegunny (Bauhinia hookeri). These are expected to also be nymphal food plants. The species was associated with white feather honeymyrtle (Melaleuca decora) in a study at three sites in western Sydney. The broad-leaved paperbark has been confirmed as a nymphal food plant.|$|E
5|$|The {{current crest}} of the club {{is based on the}} {{official}} emblem of the city of Maribor, which is in turn based on a 14th-century seal with minor differences. The badge is formed in a shape of a shield, and shows the former Piramida Castle that used to stand on top of the Pyramid Hill before it was demolished {{at the end of the}} 18th century. A violet blossom forms the backdrop. Unlike the coat of arms of the city of Maribor, the current badge of the club does not represent a white dove <b>facing</b> <b>downwards</b> to the castle, but an athlete. At the top of the shield the name of the club and the year of its foundation is inscribed. The entire badge uses only two colours, purple and yellow. Previous versions of the crest included the colour white, one of the traditional colours of the club, in the form of a white castle in the centre and a white ball that was on top of the shield. Since May 2012 the official badge includes a yellow star above the crest, which indicates the first ten domestic titles won by the club.|$|E
5|$|Wooden carvings in {{the shape}} of hawks, ancient gods, serpents and turtles are also popular. The Grand Huts, also known as grande case (chef's hut), are {{decorated}} with the filial of fleche faitiere representing the ancestral spirits, symbolic of transition between the world of the dead and the world of the living. The wood carving is shaped like the spear-like carving that adorns the top of the grande case. It comprises three parts; the flat crowned face representing the ancestor with a long, the rounded pole run through by conch shells mounted on it that represents the ancestor’s voice, and a base with the pole fixed to it to symbolise the link between the clan and the chief. The central piece is also flanked by wooden pieces with sharp points (<b>facing</b> <b>downwards)</b> that are intended to prevent bad spirits enveloping the ancestor in the central part. As it represented the power of the chiefs over their subjects, it was adopted as flag of the Kanaks by the organization leading the independent movement in New Caledonia. The arrow or the spear normally has a needle at the end to insert threaded shells from bottom to top. After the death of a Kanak chief, the fleche faitière is removed and his family takes it to their home. Though it was allowed to be used again as a sign of respect it is normally kept at burial grounds of noted citizens or at the mounds of abandoned grand houses.|$|E

25|$|Some salticid {{species are}} {{continually}} on the move, stopping periodically {{to look around}} for prey, which they then stalk immediately. Others spend more time scanning their surroundings from one position, actively stalking any prey they detect. Members of the genus Phaeacius take that strategy to extremes; they sit on a tree trunk, <b>facing</b> <b>downwards</b> and rarely do any stalking, but simply lunge down on any prey items that pass close before them.|$|E

25|$|In some circles, it is {{considered}} bad luck to depict a dragon <b>facing</b> <b>downwards,</b> as {{it is seen as}} disrespectful to place a dragon in such manner that it cannot ascend to the sky. Also, depictions of dragons in tattoos are prevalent as they are symbols of strength and power, especially criminal organisations where dragons hold a meaning all on their own. As such, it is believed that one must be fierce and strong enough, hence earning the right to wear the dragon on his skin, lest his luck be consumed by the dragons.|$|E
500|$|Although long {{assumed to}} have been quadrupedal, a 2007 {{anatomical}} study of the forelimbs has questioned this, arguing that their limited range of motion precluded effective habitual quadrupedal gait. Neither could the forelimbs swing fore and behind in a fashion similar to the hindlimbs, nor could the hand be rotated with the palmar surfaces <b>facing</b> <b>downwards.</b> This inability to pronate the hand is also supported by in-situ finds of articulated (still-connected) arms that always show unrotated hands with palmar faces facing each other. The study also ruled {{out the possibility of}} [...] "knuckle-walking" [...] and other forms of locomotion that would make an effective locomotion possible without the need to pronate the hand. Although its mass suggests a quadrupedal nature, Massospondylus would have been restricted to its hind legs for locomotion.|$|E
2500|$|During active periods, Dominican anoles {{typically}} {{perch on}} a tree or other vertical object, <b>facing</b> <b>downwards</b> to scan the ground for food or other lizards, though this perch makes them vulnerable to predators. [...] From this perch, males will extend and retract their brightly colored throat fans, both to attract mates and to ward off competitors. [...] Males will also bob their heads or perform what look like [...] "push-ups" [...] using their front legs. [...] An invading male may cause a confrontation, during which they will circle at close quarters, inflating their bodies and gaping their mouths to appear larger and menacing. [...] Physical contact during these confrontations is unusual and brief when it occurs, rarely resulting in physical injury. [...] The invader will usually retreat after these confrontations {{even if it is}} larger than the defending male.|$|E
40|$|Almost all spiders {{building}} vertical orb webs <b>face</b> <b>downwards</b> when {{sitting on}} the hubs of their webs, and their webs exhibit an up–down size asymmetry, with {{the lower part of}} the capture area being larger than the upper. However, spiders of the genus Cyclosa, which all build vertical orb webs, exhibit inter- and intraspecific variation in orientation. In particular, Cyclosa ginnaga and C. argenteoalba always face upwards, and C. octotuberculata always <b>face</b> <b>downwards,</b> whereas some C. confusa face upwards and others <b>face</b> <b>downwards</b> or even sideways. These spiders provide a unique opportunity to examine why most spiders <b>face</b> <b>downwards</b> and have asymmetrical webs. We found that upward-facing spiders had upside-down webs with larger upper parts, downward-facing spiders had normal webs with larger lower parts and sideways-facing spiders had more symmetrical webs. Downward-facing C. confusa spiders were larger than upward- and sideways-facing individuals. We also found that during prey attacks, downward-facing spiders ran significantly faster downwards than upwards, which was not the case in upward-facing spiders. These results suggest that the spider's orientation at the hub and web asymmetry enhance its foraging efficiency by minimizing the time to reach prey trapped in the web...|$|R
