5000|$|The inner {{diameter}} of the motor shaft can be enlarged, so that the drive shaft can be hollow. The <b>drive</b> <b>screw</b> and nut can therefore occupy {{the center of the}} motor, with no need for additional gearing between the motor and the <b>drive</b> <b>screw.</b>|$|R

50|$|The DA* lenses are {{designed}} for use with Pentax digital SLR cameras. DA* lenses have higher quality optics and feature {{a higher level of}} weather sealing (AW) than most DA lenses (WR). The DA* lenses are more expensive and generally feature improved light transmission and larger aperture openings for better low light performance. Some DA* lenses also feature both body <b>driven</b> <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> focusing and the Pentax SDM (Supersonic Drive Motor) lens based focus mechanism.|$|R

50|$|A {{combination}} of mechanical latches and crystals {{can do the}} same thing, but would restrict the maximum stepping rate of the motor. The non-power behaviour of the second type of motor is locked, as the <b>drive</b> <b>screw</b> is locked by the threads on the nut. Thus it holds its position with the power off.|$|R

50|$|A linear {{actuator}} using standard motors will commonly have the motor {{as a separate}} cylinder attached {{to the side of}} the actuator, either parallel with the actuator or perpendicular to the actuator. The motor may be attached to the end of the actuator. The drive motor is of typical construction with a solid drive shaft that is geared to the drive nut or <b>drive</b> <b>screw</b> of the actuator.|$|R
40|$|A Danaher Thomson linear {{actuator}} with ball <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> and a realtime control system are used here to induce vertical displacements under the driver/user seat of an in-house dynamic car simulator. In {{order to better}} support the car simulator and to dynamically protect the actuator’s ball <b>screw</b> <b>drive,</b> a layer of coil springs is used to support the whole simulator chassis. More precisely, one coil spring is placed vertically under each corner of the rectangular chassis. The paper presents {{the choice of the}} appropriate coil springs, so that to minimize as much as possible the ball <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> task of generating linear motions, corresponding to the vertical displacements and accelerations encountered by a driver during a real ride. For this application, coil springs with lower spring constant are more suited to reduce the forces in the ball <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> and thus to increase the ball <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> life expectancy...|$|R

50|$|An Air Start Unit is {{a device}} used {{to start the}} aircraft's engines when the aircraft's APU is not operational. There are three primary types of these devices that exist currently: a stored air cart, a gas turbine based unit, and a diesel engine <b>driven</b> <b>screw</b> {{compressor}} unit. All three devices create a source of high pressure air to start the aircraft engines. Typically one or two hoses are connect to these units, with the largest aircraft engines requiring three.|$|R

5000|$|In CNC, a [...] "crash" [...] {{occurs when}} the machine moves {{in such a way}} that is harmful to the machine, tools, or parts being machined, {{sometimes}} resulting in bending or breakage of cutting tools, accessory clamps, vises, and fixtures, or causing damage to the machine itself by bending guide rails, breaking <b>drive</b> <b>screws,</b> or causing structural components to crack or deform under strain. A mild crash may not damage the machine or tools, but may damage the part being machined so that it must be scrapped.|$|R
50|$|Steam and {{mechanical}} power hammers were made {{into the middle}} of the 20th century in the United States. At the end of the 19th century the mechanical power hammer became popular in smaller blacksmith and repair shops. These machines were typically rated between 25 and 500 pounds of falling weight. Many may still be seen in use in small manufacturing and artist-blacksmith shops today. In the middle of the 20th century power <b>hammers</b> <b>driven</b> by compressed air began to gain popularity and several manufacturers are currently producing these hammers today.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to fully electropneumatic marker designs, electronic trigger frames, with a solenoid-controlled sear, can be fit to most mechanical [...] "blow-back" [...] designs, {{such as the}} Kingman Spyder line of entry-level markers. These allow the high rates of fire seen in full electropneumatic designs at a very low cost compared to higher-level markers; however they typically have both the higher recoil of poppets (even worse, typically, as the designs use a traditional high-mass <b>hammer</b> <b>driven</b> forward by a spring) and relatively low gas efficiency due to a single operating pressure.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The ball <b>screw</b> <b>drive</b> {{system is}} {{obtained}} widespread application {{in the modern}} machine. Along with the improving of feeding velocity and working precision, its dynamic analysis {{becomes more and more}} important. Considering the bearing stiffness and the contact deformation between the worktable and the <b>screw,</b> the <b>drive</b> <b>screw</b> is seen as a bar under elastic supports at both ends and with an internal moving elastic support. Using boundary conditions and matching conditions, the longitudinal vibration frequency equation of the screw is derived and the mode shape of the screw is solved. The vibration frequency is analyzed when the worktable moves from the left to the right end of the screw. The effect of the system parameters on the natural frequency and the mode shape are studied to supply a base for designing the drive system...|$|R

50|$|A {{cordless}} drill is {{an electric drill}} which uses rechargeable batteries. These drills are available with similar features to an AC mains-powered drill. These {{are the most common}} type of drill. They are available in the hammer drill configuration and most have a clutch, which aids in driving screws into various substrates while not damaging them. Also available are right angle drills, which allow a worker to <b>drive</b> <b>screws</b> in a tight space. While 21st century battery innovations allow significantly more drilling, large diameter holes (typically 12 - 25 mm or larger) may drain current {{cordless drill}}s quickly.|$|R

One type of hot chisel is the hotcut hardy, which is used in an anvil hardy hole with the cutting edge facing up. The hot {{workpiece}} to be cut is placed over the chisel and struck with a <b>hammer.</b> The <b>hammer</b> <b>drives</b> the workpiece into the chisel, which allows it to be snapped off {{with a pair of}} tongs. This tool is also often used in combination with a [...] "top fuller" [...] type of hotcut, when the piece being cut is particularly large.|$|R

50|$|A barb (or hose barb), which connects {{flexible}} hose or tubing to pipes, typically has a male-threaded end which mates with female threads. The {{other end of}} the fitting has a single- or multi-barbed tube—a long tapered cone with ridges, which is inserted into a {{flexible hose}}. An adjustable worm <b>drive</b> <b>screw</b> clamp (or other type of clamp) is often added, to keep the hose from slipping off the barbed tube. Barb fittings can be made of brass for hot-water applications, and plastic may be used for cold water; brass is considered more durable for heavy-duty use. The barb fitting may be elbow-shaped or straight.|$|R

40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for controlling the crystallization of protein by solvent evaporation including placing {{a drop of}} protein solution between and in contact {{with a pair of}} parallel plates and driving one of the plates toward and away from the other plate in a controlled manner to adjust the spacing between the plates is presented. The drop of solution forms a liquid cylinder having a height dependent upon the plate spacing thereby effecting the surface area available for solvent evaporation. When the spacing is close, evaporation is slow. Evaporation is increased by increasing the spacing between the plates until the breaking point of the liquid cylinder. One plate is mounted upon a fixed post while the other plate is carried by a receptacle movable relative to the post and driven by a belt <b>driven</b> <b>screw</b> <b>drive.</b> The temperature and humidity of the drop of protein solution are controlled by sealing the drop within the receptacle and mounting a heater and dessicant within the receptacle...|$|R
