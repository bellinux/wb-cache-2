5|$|Shooting began September 23, 1937 and was {{scheduled}} to end November 20, 1937 on a budget of $767,676. Filming began in-studio with the scenes in Susan's apartment, moving to the Bel Air Country Club in early October for the golf-course scenes. The production had a difficult start due to Hepburn's struggles with her character and her comedic abilities. She frequently overacted, trying too hard to be funny, and Hawks asked vaudeville veteran Walter Catlett to help coach her. Catlett acted out scenes with Grant for Hepburn, showing {{her that he was}} funnier when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>serious.</b> Hepburn understood, acted naturally and played herself {{for the rest of the}} shoot; she was so impressed by Catlett's talent and coaching ability that she insisted he play Constable Slocum in the film.|$|E
25|$|Another scandal {{emerged from}} within the unit when a 38-year-old 1st Airborne Brigade paratrooper was arrested in Inzai, Chiba Prefecture for shoplifting. He {{admitted}} to officers {{that he did it}} to demonstrate that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> in his effort to avoid deployment to Iraq. When JGSDF officials heard about this, they told press officials that they require the consent of the troopers and their relatives. Otherwise, they would not be deployed. The Iraq deployment had caused a national debate in Japan, and a new public consensus was necessary for the military to develop a modern role and structure.|$|E
25|$|As Lord Protector, Cromwell {{was aware}} of the Jewish community's {{involvement}} in the economics of the Netherlands, now England's leading commercial rival. It was this—allied to Cromwell's tolerance of the right to private worship of those who fell outside evangelical Puritanism—that led to his encouraging Jews to return to England in 1657, over 350 years after their banishment by Edward I, in the hope that they would help speed up the recovery of the country after the disruption of the Civil Wars. There was a longer-term motive for Cromwell's decision to allow the Jews to return to England, and that was the hope that they would convert to Christianity and therefore hasten the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, ultimately based on Matthew 23:37–39 and Romans 11. At the Whitehall conference of December 1655 he quoted from St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans 10:12–15 on the need to send Christian preachers to the Jews. Cromwell's long-term religious motive for readmitting the Jews to England should not be doubted; after all, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> enough to ban Christmas as a pagan festival. William Prynne the Presbyterian, in contrast to Cromwell the Congregationalist, was strongly opposed to the latter's pro-Jewish policy.|$|E

500|$|Although born in Austria, {{and brought}} up in Italy and Germany, he {{enrolled}} in the United Kingdom's Royal Navy {{at the age of}} fourteen. Queen Victoria and her son King Edward VII, when Prince of Wales, occasionally intervened in his career: the Queen thought that there was [...] "a belief that the Admiralty are afraid of promoting Officers who are Princes on account of the radical attacks of low papers and scurrilous ones". However, Louis welcomed assignments that provided opportunities for him to acquire the skills of war and to demonstrate to his superiors that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> about his naval career. Posts on royal yachts and tours arranged by the Queen and Edward actually impeded his progress, as his promotions were perceived as royal favours rather than deserved.|$|E
500|$|After the announcement, Trump and Knauss {{had dinner}} with Ventura and were joined by actor Woody Harrelson. Ventura later commented that Trump's chances of success {{depended}} on his impression of the Reform Party. [...] Onlookers questioned Trump's motive in running. [...] Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman expressed doubts about the authenticity of Trump's campaign, saying [...] "It’s all marketing of his name." [...] Matt Bai of Newsweek commented [...] "Most serious-minded people think Trump's flirtation with the Reform Party's presidential nomination is just a publicity stunt." [...] Ex-wife Ivana Trump doubted he would actually run. [...] Former New York City Mayor Ed Koch commented that people would likely not flock to Trump's campaign, suggesting that Trump was merchandising his brand. Trump disagreed with the critics, arguing that even though his sales had increased {{as a result of}} media coverage, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> about the campaign. [...] Roger Stone was hired as director of the exploratory committee.|$|E
500|$|On January 31, 2007, Biden {{took his}} first steps into the presidential campaign, but his {{comments}} about other candidates overshadowed his entrance. Biden especially drew criticism in the popular press for his evaluation of Senator Barack Obama; Biden {{was quoted in the}} New York Observer as saying: [...] "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, ... I mean, that's a storybook, man." [...] The audio of the interview, posted on the Observers website, reportedly includes a significant pause after [...] "African-American" [...] which would drastically change the meaning of the statement. Biden sought to clear up the controversy by apologizing to Obama on the same day and repeated his regret on The Daily Show that same evening: [...] "Look, the other part of this thing that got me in trouble is using the word clean. I should have said fresh." [...] Some media observers labeled Biden's announcement a [...] "launch pad disaster." [...] Jesse Jackson telephoned Biden and reported afterward [...] "Senator Biden...assured me that he regrets that his remarks were misinterpreted. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> and contrite. To me, this was a gaffe, not a statement about his philosophy or ideology." ...|$|E

2500|$|Taylor's major love {{interest}} is Ridge Forrester (Ronn Moss). The couple faces challenges at first, such as interference from their respective exes, Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) and Blake Hayes (Peter Brown), and Ridge's mother, Stephanie Forrester (Susan Flannery), initially disliking Taylor. By July 1991, John Goudas of The Gadsden Times wrote that Taylor was [...] "hooked" [...] by Ridge but was [...] "no-nonsense". Taylor refuses to marry Ridge unless <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> {{about the end}} of his relationship with Brooke; Goudas noted that Taylor wanted [...] "insurance" [...] and deemed her [...] "upfront" [...] approach as the [...] "polar opposite" [...] to that of Brooke. Ridge and Taylor ultimately marry in 1992. The actors were under pressure during the shooting of the wedding as it was filmed {{on the day of the}} Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|Slim had an {{excellent}} relationship with his troops – the [...] "Forgotten Army", as they called themselves. In his book, Defeat into Victory, he tells of the malaria rates among his units being 70%, largely due to noncompliance by his soldiers with the foul-tasting mepacrine they refused to take. Slim did not blame his medics for this problem, but placed the responsibility on his officers. [...] "Good doctors are no use without good discipline. More than half the battle against disease is fought not by the doctors, but by the regimental officers". After Slim dismissed a few officers for high unit malaria rates, the others realised <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> and malaria treatment was enforced, dropping the rate to less than five percent. The combat effectiveness of his army was thus greatly enhanced. This physical and mental turnaround in the army under him was a contributing factor to the eventual defeat of the Japanese in Burma.|$|E

2500|$|On October 16, 2007, satirist Stephen Colbert (in {{the guise}} of his character) officially {{announced}} that he would run for President of the United States. This came after weeks of being pressured to do so by the public and stating that he would need a sign, which came from Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) giving him the sword Anduril. Although the legitimacy of his campaign was questioned, he maintained that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>serious.</b> Colbert had originally planned to run for both the Republican and the Democratic nomination {{in his home state of}} South Carolina. [...] After learning that the fee to file for the Republican primary was $35,000, he abandoned plans to run as a Republican (he had previously stated that he could avoid FEC rules if he stayed under $5,000 in campaign expenditure). [...] Although he paid the $2,500 fee to be included in the South Carolina Democratic ballot, he was denied a place on the ballot by the South Carolina Democratic Party executive council. On November 5, 2007, Colbert officially dropped his presidential bid.|$|E
