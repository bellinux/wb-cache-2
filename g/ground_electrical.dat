40|$|Resonant {{grounding}} is efficient {{system for}} <b>grounding</b> <b>electrical</b> appliances. Unlike solidly grounded system where the fault current developed keeps circulating {{in the system}} causing arcing and other heat losses which end up causing total power failure. The action of resonant grounding in Nigerian power system was critically studied in this work. In Nigerian power system, solid grounding {{has been the only}} method of <b>grounding</b> <b>electrical</b> systems. As a result, consistency in power failure has continued to characterize Nigerian power system. To see how effective the system could be in Nigerian power system, a 66 KV network was modeled and simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK. Results show that when the star point of a transformer connected to five feeder system was resonantly grounded, the quality of power supply in the substation was improved by 40 % after one year of operation. Again, when used to ground generator turbine, the fatigue experienced by the generator due to torsional vibration was reduced to the barest minimum. Thus, the ground fault neutralizer would work effectively in Nigerian power system, in order {{to improve the quality of}} power supply...|$|R

50|$|The {{individual}} triggers {{for a car}} alarm vary widely, {{depending on}} the make and model of the vehicle, and the brand and model of the alarm itself (for aftermarket alarms). Since aftermarket alarms {{are designed to be}} universal (i.e., compatible with all 12-volt negative <b>ground</b> <b>electrical</b> systems as opposed to one carmaker's vehicles), these commonly have trigger inputs that the installer/vehicle owner chooses not to connect, which additionally determines what will set the alarm off.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} enhance the depth of exploration, we used a <b>grounded</b> <b>electrical</b> source aligned {{parallel}} to the coast line and towed a magnetic receiver in the air. The method, called grounded-electrical-source airborne transient electromagnetics, or GREATEM (Mogi et al., 1998), should enhance survey depth in coastal areas, since this method galvanically injects electric current into the ground. The method has increased the depth of exploration to 800 m in on-shore areas (Mogi et al., 2009) compared to 300 m by conventional AEM.|$|R
30|$|GREATEM survey {{techniques}} {{have been introduced}} {{in the fields of}} engineering and environmental science, particularly for studies involving active volcanoes (Mogi et al. 2009). To enhance the depth of exploration, we used a large-moment <b>grounded</b> <b>electrical</b> source as a transmitter and towed a magnetic sensor through the air as a receiver. The method increases the survey depth of penetration because it galvanically injects electric current into the ground using a large-moment source and a long transmitter–receiver distance (Abd Allah et al. 2013 a).|$|R

Flight reconnaissance was conducted on September 7, 2010, when the difference in tide height was the largest (1.1 m). Flights along eleven lines (A-K lines) spaced 200 m apart were performed twice (at the time of low and high tides) to examine whether a difference in tide heights affects the results. Due to flight regulations in Japan, residential areas were avoided.|$|R

This final {{production}} run {{did not have}} alternating black and white S-IB stage tanks, or vertical stripes on the S-IVB aft tank skirt, which were present on the earlier vehicles. Since LC-34 and 37 were inactive by then, these launches utilized Kennedy Space Center's LC-39B. Mobile Launcher Platform No. 1 was modified, adding an elevated platform known as the [...] "milkstool" [...] to accommodate the height differential between the Saturn IB and the much larger Saturn V. This enabled alignment of the Launch Umbilical Tower's access arms to accommodate crew access, fueling, and <b>ground</b> <b>electrical</b> connections for the Apollo spacecraft and S-IVB upper stage.

50|$|These {{are used}} when {{laboratory}} testing {{is not enough}} to determine the required properties of the ground. Laboratory samples are at times not considered to be representative and of insufficient quality, stress, pore pressure, and degree of saturation. Discontinuities in the ground can also warrant filed tests. Sample sizes depend on ground nature and test type. Boreholes are commonly used. The SPT is a simple and inexpensive test which can furnish a piling contractor with useful information. The van test is used to determine the shear strength of a soil - material with coarse silt or sand can mean unreliable results. Permeability is found by determining whether the relevant aquifer is confined on unconfined with cognizance of the normal fluctuations in the aquifer. Installation of the borehole itself may influence stresses. For a reliable test this should be followed by a pumping test. Packer tests are also used to measure the impermeability of grouted ground and permeability of dam foundations, strength and deformation data can also be taken. There are many types, mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic, the latter being the most popular. A clean borehole with a properly seated packer is essential (cement mortar is sometime used). Geophysical logs from the boreholes used can be taken at the same time enhancing the value of the results. Pressuremeter tests are used to stress, stiffness and strength of the ground to be investigated. It can be used in most ground types. There are three main types - pre-bored, self bored and pushed in. Boring should do minimal damage to the ground as much as possible. an unload reload method of around three times is used to give an accurate value of stiffness. Probing from the surface is done using a steel rod. Mainly used at a preliminary stage, it is also useful to check surrounding ground but is unsuitable in soils with boulders and cobbles. Static probing is mostly conducted with the use of electric sensors. It is quick and cheap. Pumping allows the determination of groundwater conditions using pumping and observation wells. Data interpretation can be complicated and is classed in steady and non-steady states. Density testing is conducted using the average of three results to obtain a significant result. The use of the sand replacement and core cutter test are common and the use of water replacement, rubber balloon, and nuclear methods are also used.In-situ testing data is important to design of works. Stress measurement in rocks and soils can be determined. Bearing tests are used to determine the shear strength and deformation characteristics of a soil. In-situ shear testing is done using a system similar to the laboratory shear box test. Large scale testing should be assessed on a case by case basis. Slope failure or settlement of a structure after field tests have been conducted are examples of phenomena which may be considered as back analysis, this be conducted successfully when accompanied by a full investigation to determine the ground and ground water conditions. Geophysical surveying can be useful in site investigation for determining layers of rock other geological features, locating aquifers, mineral deposits, voids - natural or man-made and engineering properties of the <b>ground.</b> <b>Electrical</b> resistivity and seismic methods amongst others are used. This is a specialized field. The geophysical adviser should be involved at all stages. Experience has shown care should be taken when writing the specification for this type of work amongst other factors.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{analyzing}} {{the influence of the}} frequency-dependent behavior of the <b>ground</b> <b>electrical</b> parameters (conductivity and ground permittivity) on the electromagnetic field radiated by a cloud-to-ground lightning return stroke. Both radiation in air (over the conducting ground plane) and underground are considered in the analysis. The adopted method is based on the classical Sommerfeld’s theory and takes advantage of an efficient ad hoc numerical procedure to face with the slow converging Sommerfeld’s integrals. This feature allows the electromagnetic field to be computed without any sort of mathematical approximation and, since it is carried out in the frequency domain, can be used either if the ground permittivity and conductivity are considered constant or if they vary with the working frequency with any functional law. Simulations have been performed to identify the cases in which the approximation of constant ground permittivity and conductivity leads to satisfactory results. It is shown that for soils with water contents of 2 % to 10 % (ground conductivities in the order of 0. 001 to 0. 01 S/m), the assumption of constant electrical parameters appears to be reasonable. However, for either very poorly conducting soils (104 S/m or so) or highly conducting soils (101 S/m), the electromagnetic field components appear to be significantly affected by the frequency dependence of the <b>ground</b> <b>electrical</b> parameters...|$|E
