40|$|The APOBEC 3 {{restriction}} factors {{belong to}} a family of cytidine deaminases {{that are able to}} suppress the replication of viruses with a single-stranded DNA intermediate by inducing mutagenesis and functional inactivation of the virus. Of the seven common human APOBEC 3 enzymes, only APOBEC 3 -D, -F, -G and -H appear to be relevant to HIV- 1 restriction in CD 4 + T cells. The restriction of HIV- 1 by APOBEC 3 enzymes occurs most potently in the absence of HIV- 1 Vif, which counteracts APOBEC 3 s by inducing polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of APOBEC 3 enzymes. Virion-encapsidated APOBEC 3 s can deaminate cytosines to uracils in viral (-) DNA. Upon replication of (-) DNA to (+) DNA, the HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase incorporates adenines opposite to the uracils hereby inducing C/G to T/A transition mutations. Among all APOBEC 3 enzymes that are relevant to HIV- 1 restriction, APOBEC 3 G is the most studied APOBEC 3 enzyme. APOBEC 3 G has been shown to processively catalyze deamination reactions on single-stranded (-) DNA using a mechanism called facilitated diffusion, which involves sliding and jumping movements in search of target cytosine-containing motifs. This single-stranded DNA scanning mechanism allows APOBEC 3 G to efficiently deaminate multiple cytosines within one enzyme-DNA encounter and {{it is important for the}} mutational inactivation of HIV- 1 in vivo. Vif attempts to neutralize APOBEC 3 G’s function not only by inducing proteasomal degradation, but also by several degradation-independent mechanisms, such as inhibiting APOBEC 3 G virion encapsidation, mRNA translation, and for those APOBEC 3 G molecules that still become virion encapsidated, Vif has been shown to inhibit APOBEC 3 G’s deamination activity. My Ph. D. thesis work investigated the molecular mechanism of degradation-independent Vif-mediated inhibition of APOBEC 3 G and APOBEC 3 H deamination activity. This research led to the development of the hypothesis that Vif has developed a unique interaction with each APOBEC 3 enzyme due to the different selection pressures they impose on HIV- 1. Thus, we investigated how the interaction of Vif differs between APOBEC 3 G and APOBEC 3 H and characterized the activity of APOBEC 3 H as a restriction factor. This research allowed us to have a better understanding of the molecular determinants that govern an efficient APOBEC 3 -degradatation by HIV- 1 Vif and provide insights for APOBEC 3 -based HIV- 1 therapeutics. Two Vif variants obtained from HIV- 1 laboratory isolates, VifHXB 2 and VifIIIB, were used to determine the degradation-independent effects of Vif on APOBEC 3 G. Biochemical assays using a model HIV- 1 replication assay and synthetic single-stranded or partially double-stranded DNA substrates demonstrated that APOBEC 3 G has an altered processive mechanism in the presence of Vif, and this caused APOBEC 3 G to be less effective at inducing mutagenesis in a model HIV- 1 replication assay. APOBEC 3 H is unique in that it is the only single-domain common APOBEC 3 enzyme that restricts HIV- 1. APOBEC 3 H exists in humans as seven haplotypes (I-VII) with different cellular stabilities. Amongst three stable APOBEC 3 H haplotypes, haplotype II and V occur most frequently in the population. I characterized the single-stranded DNA scanning mechanisms that haplotype II and V use to search their single-stranded substrate for cytosine-containing deamination motif. APOBEC 3 H haplotype II was able to processively deaminate its substrate using Brownian motion-driven movements termed sliding, jumping and intersegmental transfer, whereas haplotype V showed compromised sliding and intersegmental transfer abilities but was able to jump along single-stranded DNA. Since an Asp or Glu at amino acid 178 differentiates these two haplotypes, these data suggest this amino acid on predicted helix 6 contributes to processivity. I found the optimal processivity on ssDNA also required dimerization of APOBEC 3 H through the β 2 strands. The diminished processivity of APOBEC 3 H haplotype V did not result in a reduced efficiency to restrict HIV- 1 replication in single-cycle infectivity assay. This suggests a redundancy in the contribution of jumping and intersegmental transfer to mutagenic efficiency. VifHXB 2, but not VifIIIB, can cause degradation of APOBEC 3 H even though APOBEC 3 H interacts with both Vif variants. APOBEC 3 G is degraded after interaction with both of these Vif variants. To define the parameters for efficient Vif-induced degradation of an APOBEC 3 enzyme, I used an in vitro quantitative method to determine the binding strength of APOBEC 3 G and APOBEC 3 H with Vif variant heterotetramers (Vif/CBFβ/EloB/EloC), the most stable form of Vif. Our biochemical analysis, along with cellular experiments to determine Vif-induced degradation efficiency and APOBEC 3 -Vif interactions in cells, support a model in which the degradation efficiency of Vifs correlates with both the APOBEC 3 -Vif binding strength and APOBEC 3 -Vif interface. I also investigated how APOBEC 3 enzymes restrict the replication of retrotransposon LINE- 1. Retrotransposons are DNA sequences that replicate using a “copy-and-paste” mechanism through an RNA intermediate. The degradation of deaminated L 1 cDNA rendered it difficult to detect any APOBEC 3 -induced G-to-A mutations while the addition of uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor allowed for the recovery of the APOBEC 3 -mediated deamination events. I found that two stable A 3 H haplotypes (haplotype II and haplotype V) use a deamination-independent mechanism to restrict L 1 mobilization and compared the ability of APOBEC 3 H’s to <b>inhibit</b> <b>LINE</b> 1 with that of APOBEC 3 A and APOBEC 3 G, two APOBEC 3 s whose LINE 1 restriction ability have been previously characterized. Taken together, these studies of the molecular mechanisms that APOBEC 3 G and APOBEC 3 H use to inhibit HIV- 1 and LINE 1 have allowed us to better understand their biological properties as cytidine deaminases and the determinants in APOBEC 3 s that made them efficient host innate immune restriction factors...|$|E

Fecha de lectura 29 - 02 - 2008 This thesis aim to {{investigate}} the lines function during the imaginal wing disc development. It was found that lines mutant cells induce an aberrant responses to key signaling pathways: Notch (N), Wingless (Wg), JAK/STAT, Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and EGFR, which yield changes in the proximal-distal cell identity and a cell dramatic overgrowth. A regulatory network involving Lines/Drumstick/Bowl is implicated in the integration of patterning information at several stages during the development. It was shown that the same cassette is important in integrating several different signaling events in the developing wing. Moreover, two additional members of the odd-skipped family were included to this regulatory network, odd and sob. Drm, Odd and Sob <b>inhibit</b> <b>Lines</b> functions allowing Bowl nuclear accumulation. Drm controls nuclear Lines levels, Lines turns down the steady-state accumulation of Bowl protein in the wing disc. Odd and Sob fail in Lines relocalization to the cytoplasm but their ability to interact with Bowl suggests that {{the formation of a}} protein complex would <b>inhibit</b> <b>Lines</b> function. Genetic experiments show that Bowl is the primary effector of this regulatory network. In this generic network Drm/Lines/Bowl, lines is implicated in the wing development by limiting Bowl expression to the peripodial cells. A genetic interaction between Lines/Bowl and Groucho, a general co-repressor of N, Wg, EGFR, and Dpp pathways it was found. It is proposed that Lines is a modular factor of transcriptional complexes that integrates the response to different signaling pathways to control patterning and growth during development.

In this study, transgenic tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants expressing a fragment of the β-subunit of succinyl-coenzyme A ligase in either the antisense orientation or using the RNA interference approach, however, revealed little alteration in either photosynthesis or plant growth despite exhibiting dramatic reductions in activity. Moreover, the rate of respiration was only moderately affected in the transformants, suggesting that this enzyme does not catalyze a crucial step in mitochondrial respiration. However, metabolite and transcript profiling of these lines alongside enzyme and label redistribution experiments revealed that, whereas considerable activity of this enzyme appears to be dispensable, the reason for such a mild phenotype in extremely <b>inhibited</b> <b>lines</b> was an up-regulation of an alternative pathway for succinate production—that offered by the γ-aminobutyric acid shunt.

40|$|Hedgehog and Wingless {{signaling}} in the Drosophila embryonic epidermis {{represents one}} paradigm for organizer function. In patterning this epidermis, Hedgehog and Wingless act asymmetrically, and consequently otherwise equivalent cells {{on either side}} of the organizer follow distinct developmental fates. To better understand the downstream mechanisms involved, we have investigated mutations that disrupt dorsal epidermal pattern. We have previously demonstrated that the gene lines contributes to this process. Here we show that the Lines protein interacts functionally with the zinc-finger proteins Drumstick (Drm) and Bowl. Competitive protein-protein interactions between Lines and Bowl and between Drm and Lines regulate the steady-state accumulation of Bowl, the downstream effector of this pathway. Lines binds directly to Bowl and decreases Bowl abundance. Conversely, Drm allows Bowl accumulation in drm-expressing cells by <b>inhibiting</b> <b>Lines.</b> This is accomplished both by outcompeting Bowl in binding to Lines and by redistributing Lines to the cytoplasm, thereby segregating Lines away from nuclearly localized Bowl. Hedgehog and Wingless affect these functional interactions by regulating drm expression. Hedgehog promotes Bowl protein accumulation by promoting drm expression, while Wingless inhibits Bowl accumulation by repressing drm expression anterior to the source of Hedgehog production. Thus, Drm, Lines, and Bowl are components of a molecular regulatory pathway that links antagonistic and asymmetric Hedgehog and Wingless signaling inputs to epidermal cell differentiation. Finally, we show that Drm and Lines also regulate Bowl accumulation and consequent patterning in the epithelia of the foregut, hindgut, and imaginal discs. Thus, in all these developmental contexts, including the embryonic epidermis, the novel molecular regulatory pathway defined here is deployed in order to elaborate pattern across a field of cells...|$|R

TGF-beta 1 -S-ODNs inhibited cell proliferation in 5 of 12 gliomas, whereas TGF-beta 2 -S-ODNs reduced the cell proliferation in all glioma cell lines, compared to nonsense-S-ODN-treated and S-ODN-untreated cells as controls.

40|$|X-ray heating of the {{photosphere}} of an {{accretion disk}} {{is a possible}} mechanism to produce strong, broad UV emission lines in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). However, detailed photoionization calculations show that this mechanism fails to produce sufficient emission measure. We present the results of hydrodynamical calculations of the disk photosphere irradiated by strong X-rays. We attempt to determine whether LMXBs can harbor significant UV-driven disk winds despite the effects of X-ray ionization. Such winds would be a likely candidate for the site of emission of UV lines and may better explain the observations than the X-ray heated disk photosphere. We find that the local disk radiation cannot launch a wind from the disk because of strong ionizing radiation from the central object. Unphysically high X-ray opacities {{would be required to}} shield the UV emitting disk and allow the line force to drive a disk wind. However the same X-ray radiation that <b>inhibits</b> <b>line</b> driving heats the disk and can produce a hot bipolar wind or corona above the disk. To assess the impact of X-ray heating upon driving of a disk wind by the line force in any system with an accretion disk we derive analytic formulae. In particular, we compare results of line-driven disk wind models for accretion disks in LMXBs and active galactic nuclei. The latter show spectral features associated with a strong and fast disk wind. The key parameter determining the role of the line force is not merely the presence of the luminous UV zone in the disk and the presence of the X-rays, but also the distance of this UV zone from the center.

In this thesis, {{the production of}} two novel potato starch qualities, amylopectin and high-amylose, and the modifications and {{the characteristics of the}} produced plants and starches are described. The novel potato starch qualities will find uses in e. g. the paper, adhesive, textile and packing industries. Amylopectin potato lines were produced by antisense inhibition of a single gene, coding for a granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS). One amylopectin line, EH 92 - 527 - 1, is currently in an approval phase {{in the form of a}} European market notification. EH 92 - 527 - 1 has been thoroughly characterised and molecular and chemical data for the line are presented. During the characterisation it was found that the antisense gene had been rearranged upon insertion, creating a truncated asymmetric inverted repeat. The inverted repeat is probably what is yielding the very efficient GBSS inhibition. The line was also shown to have an increased vitamin C level compared with the parental variety, probably due to an alteration in the sugar metabolism in the line. One issue often debated concerning genetically modified plants is the use of a selection gene transformed together with the trait gene/genes to be able to select for transgenic lines. A neomycin phosphotransferase gene (nptII), coding for a protein giving the plant resistance to the antibiotic kanamycin, is almost exclusively used as selection system during potato transformation. A non-antibiotic selection system based on a mutated acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) and herbicides of the imidazolinone family was developed, yielding a higher transformation rate than when nptII is used. In contrast to amylopectin potatoes, the expression of two genes, coding for starch branching enzymes (SBE), had to be down-regulated to produce the required high-amylose potato starch. The starch had up to 7 times lower branching degree and a major increase in the amount of bound phosphate compared with the parental line. High-amylose lines were first produced by antisense inhibition of the two sbe genes but the frequency of lines with high-amylose starch quality was very low. To improve this, an RNA interference (RNAi) method was developed, which yielded a 10 -fold higher frequency of <b>inhibited</b> <b>lines.</b> Another major advantage found with the RNAi method was a reduction in the number of T-DNA inserts compared with the previously used antisense technique.

40|$|RN 1, a {{polysaccharide}} from {{flowers of}} Panax pseudo-ginsieng Wall. Var. notoginseng (Burkill) Hoo & Tseng, {{is a potential}} multi-targeting drug candidate for pancreatic cancer treatment. However, the active targeting domain of RN 1 is still unknown. Herein, three RN 1 derived branches were synthesized via [3 + 2] or [2 + 2] strategies, efficiently. Two pentasaccharides, 18 and 27, showed similar inhibition effect on pancreatic cancer BxPC- 3 cells to that of RN 1 at same concentration. Interestingly, tetrasaccharide 21 potently <b>inhibited</b> gemcitabineresistant cell <b>line</b> Panc- 1 at high concentration. These suggest that the branches of RN 1 might be the active targeting domain and tetrasaccharide 21 might be a potential leading compound for pancreatic cancer with gemcitabine resistance...|$|R
40|$|Bacteria must {{accurately}} replicate and segregate {{their genetic}} information {{to ensure the}} production of viable daughter cells. The high fidelity of chromosome partitioning is achieved through mechanisms that coordinate cell division with DNA replication. We report that YycJ (WalJ), a predicted member of the metallo [...] lactamase superfamily found in most low-GC Gram-positive bacteria, contributes to the fidelity of cell division in Bacillus subtilis. B. subtilis walJ (walJBsu) mutants divide over unsegregated chromosomes more frequently than wild-type cells, and this phenotype is exacerbated when DNA replication is <b>inhibited.</b> Two <b>lines</b> of evidence suggest that WalJBsu and its ortholog in the Gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, WalJSpn (VicX), {{play a role in}} cell wall metabolism: (i) strains of B. subtilis and S. pneumoniae lacking walJ exhibit increased sensitivity to a narrow spectrum of cephalosporin antibiotics, and (ii) reducing the expression of a two-component system that regulates genes involved in cell wall metabolism, WalRK (YycFG), renders walJ essential for growth in B. subtilis, as observed previously with S. pneumoniae. Together, these results suggest that the enzymatic activity of WalJ directly or indirectly affects cell wall metabolism and is required for accurate coordination of cell division with DNA replication. All cells are faced with the fundamental challenge of dupli-cating their genetic information and accurately partitioning...|$|R
40|$|Attention {{is given}} to the process by which the shape of the {{constriction}} of field <b>lines</b> <b>inhibiting</b> the conduction of heat down from the corona acts in conjunction with the degree of constriction to inhibit the heat flow. The analytical model for the heat flow involves tapered flux tubes in which the plasma properties are constant on cross sections, while the plasma is static and the only energy transfer is by thermal conduction. It is determined that only two specific solutions to the model are applicable to the solar atmosphere: the steady state, which is appropriate for quiet regions and for active ones that are not flaring, and the time-dependent case, in which no heat enters the hot end, which is appropriate for conductive cooling of flare loops...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTyrosine {{phosphorylation}} of adaptor proteins {{permits the}} B cell antigen receptor (BCR) -associated protein tyrosine kinases to regulate downstream effector molecules. Here, we report {{the identification of}} a novel B cell adaptor for phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K), termed BCAP. Tyrosine phosphorylation of BCAP is mediated by Syk and Btk, thereby providing binding site(s) for the p 85 subunit of PI 3 K. Disruption of the BCAP gene in the DT 40 B cell <b>line</b> <b>inhibits</b> BCR-mediated phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 -trisphosphate generation, leading to impaired Akt response. Moreover, recruitment of PI 3 K to glycolipid-enriched microdomains (GEMs) is significantly attenuated {{in the absence of}} BCAP. Hence, these data suggest that BCAP bridges BCR-associated kinases to the PI 3 K pathway by regulating PI 3 K localization...|$|R
40|$|Corresponding authors Background: Euploid {{chromosome}} {{balance is}} vitally important for normal development, but is profoundly changed in many tumors. Is each tumor dependent on its own structurally and numerically changed chromosome complement that has evolved during its development and progression? We have previously shown that normal chromosome 3 transfer into the KH 39 renal cell carcinoma line and into the Hone 1 nasopharyngeal carcinoma <b>line</b> <b>inhibited</b> their tumorigenicity. The aim {{of the present study}} was to distinguish between a qualitative and a quantitative model of this suppression. According to the former, a damaged or deleted tumor suppressor gene would be restored by the transfer of a normal chromosome. If so, suppression would be released only when the corresponding sequences of the exogenous normal chromosome are lost or inactivated. According to th...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIn layer 6 (L 6), a {{principal}} output {{layer of the}} mammalian cerebral cortex, a population of excitatory neurons defined by the NTSR 1 -Cre mouse <b>line</b> <b>inhibit</b> cortical responses to visual stimuli. Here we show that {{of the two major}} types of excitatory neurons existing in L 6, the NTSR 1 -Cre line selectively targets those whose axons innervate both cortex and thalamus and not those whose axons remain within the cortex. These corticothalamic neurons mediate widespread inhibition across all cortical layers by recruiting fast-spiking inhibitory neurons whose cell body resides in deep cortical layers yet whose axons arborize throughout all layers. This study reveals a circuit by which L 6 modulates cortical activity and identifies an inhibitory neuron able to regulate the strength of cortical responses throughout cortical depth.

50|$|The {{season was}} above average despite an El Niño, which {{typically}} suppresses tropical cyclogenesis in the Atlantic Ocean while increasing {{activity in the}} eastern Pacific Ocean. The Atlantic upper tropospheric shear line, a semi-permanent feature that extended southeastward into the Caribbean Sea, which enhances outflow from disturbances, remained persistent throughout the season. However, the opposite periphery of the shear <b>line</b> <b>inhibits</b> the divergent outflow of a disturbance. This may have {{increased the number of}} tropical cyclones developing, while causing other storms to remain weak or dissipating over the deep tropics. Additionally, an abnormally strong mid-tropospheric ridge replaced the further south than normal westerlies that deterred tropical cyclone formation in 1968. Five hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall, causing 535 deaths and $1.49 billion in damage; Tropical Depression Twenty-Nine also resulted in damage.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. IGF-binding protein- 3 (IGFBP- 3) {{has been}} shown to induce {{apoptosis}} in an insulin-like growth factor (IGF) -independent manner in various cell systems, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. In the present study, we showed that IGFBP- 3 significantly enhanced interleukin- 24 (IL- 24) -induced cell death in prostate cancer (PC) cell lines in vitro. Both the addition of IGFBP- 3 to cell medium or the enforced expression of IGFBP- 3 in the PC cell <b>line</b> <b>inhibited</b> activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Downregulation of mTOR/S 6 K reduced Mcl- 1 protein expression and consequently promoted sensitization to IL- 24 treatment. Overexpression of Mcl- 1 reduced the level of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) induced by IL- 24 and IGFBP- 3, suggesting that the IL- 24 -induced apop-tosis is realized by way of Mcl- 1. We then showed that th...|$|R
