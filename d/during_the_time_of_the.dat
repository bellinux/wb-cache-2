5|$|Buddhist {{scholars}} living <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Liao dynasty {{predicted that}} the mofa (末法), an age in which the three treasures of Buddhism would be destroyed, was to begin in the year 1052. Previous dynasties, including the Sui and Tang, were also concerned with the mofa, although their predictions for when the mofa would start were {{different from the one}} selected by the Liao. As early as the Sui dynasty, efforts were made to preserve Buddhist teachings by carving them into stone or burying them. These efforts continued into the Liao dynasty, with Emperor Xingzong funding several projects in the years immediately preceding 1052.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started on}} the {{extension}} in 1914. To allow for {{the extension of the}} line south from Times Square, the entire western wall of the subway between 43rd Street and 44th Street was removed, all while service continued uninterrupted. The line was mostly built in an open-cut, excluding the segments within the limits of Battery Park, the widened portions of Varick Street, and the new Varick and Seventh Avenue Extensions. Filled in ground was found south of Varick Street along Greenwich Street, which approximately marked the old shore line of the Hudson River <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Revolution. Many buildings had to be underpinned during the construction of the line, especially those on the lower sections through Greenwich Street.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, the {{purchasing}} power of Byzantine merchants became such that it could influence prices in markets as far afield as Cairo and Alexandria. In reflection of their success, emperors gave merchants the right to become members of the Senate, that is to integrate themselves with the ruling elite. This had an end {{by the end of}} the eleventh century when political machinations allowed the landed aristocracy to secure the throne for a century and more. Following that phase, however, the enterprising merchants bounced back and wielded real clout <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Crusade.|$|E

In retaliation the Ottoman Empire directed their vassal Tatar forces, based in Crimea or Budjak areas, against the Commonwealth regions of Podolia and Red Ruthenia. The borderland area to the south-east {{was in a state}} of semi-permanent warfare until the 18th century.

Pommereul owned a castle which had been the headquarters of the Comte de Puisaye, a royalist leader involved with a failed invasion of royalist exiles at Quiberon.

5|$|In {{their design}} of the reductions, the Jesuits were {{inspired}} by “ideal cities“ as outlined in works such as Utopia and Arcadia, written respectively by the 16th-century English philosophers Thomas More and Philip Sidney. The Jesuits had specific criteria for building sites: locations with plenty of wood for construction; sufficient water for the population; good soil for agriculture; and safety from flooding during the rainy season. Although most of the missions in the Chiquitania were relocated at least once <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jesuits, four of ten towns remained at their original sites. Wood and adobe were the main materials used {{in the construction of}} the settlements.|$|E
5|$|It is {{acceptable}} to defend from a violent attack anywhere on the street especially {{when a person is}} attacked with a knife or another deadly weapon. Shooting an unarmed attacker also occurs and becomes sometimes a subject of controversy. In general, each case is investigated in great detail before being eventually dismissed as a legitimate self-defense. The defense is judged according to the subjective and objective perception of the defender <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imminent or ongoing attack, and not according to the view of persons who are judging it ex post.|$|E

The group's main purpose was to promote patriotic feelings among German women, and it emphasized the family and German morality. The Königin-Luise-Bund was active <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Weimar Republic and {{the first years of the}} Third Reich.

5|$|Many {{art objects}} were {{produced}} in Northern China <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern Celestial Masters. These objects were closely modeled on Buddhist designs. The {{image of the}} god (usually Laozi), would be carved on the front side of a stone stele, with inscriptions on the back or side of the carving. The inscriptions were usually prayers to the dead, a wish for the happiness of family members or wishes for political peace. The iconography and contents of the inscriptions show that a close relationship between Daoism and Buddhism existed in the Northern Wei state. This relationship is especially evident in some four-sided stelae that had carvings of both Laozi on two sides and the Buddha on the other two.|$|E
