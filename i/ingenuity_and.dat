5|$|It is {{the nature}} of man to build the most {{complicated}} cage of rules and regulations in which to trap himself, and then, with equal <b>ingenuity</b> <b>and</b> zest, to bend his brain to the problem of wriggling triumphantly out again.

5|$|The {{second half}} of the 19th century has often been called the Heroic Age of polar exploration.

5|$|Some reviewers fondly {{recalled}} serendipitous in-game encounters as {{they learned}} the game environment's unwritten rules. Not knowing how foreign figures would react, Rock, Paper, Shotgun reviewer treated new encounters as puzzles. This experimentation led to moments of fearful scrambling across {{a room to}} avoid a new, encroaching enemy type, and discovering that other enemies that are harmless if left alone. Rain World was abundant with opportunities for a player to demonstrate <b>ingenuity</b> <b>and</b> improvisation, according to GameSpot reviewer, whose highlights included making a mouse into a dark room's lantern, using weapons as climbable objects, and luring enemies into battle to distract from the Slugcat's presence. Those critics considered these mysterious, perceptive interactions {{to be among the}} game's best features, though far outweighed by Rain World punishing game mechanics.|$|E
5|$|The terrans are a young {{species with}} psionic potential. The terrans of the Koprulu sector descend from the {{survivors}} of a disastrous 23rd century colonization mission from Earth. Compared to the protoss and zerg, the terrans are technologically inferior, lacking in genetic-diversity, and highly factionalized. The seven dominant government factions are the Moebius Foundation, the Kel-Morian Combine, the Tarsonis Republic, the Mar Sara Republic, the Terran Dominion, the Umojan Protectorate, and the United Earth Directorate. Terrans are {{in a constant state}} of conflict: whenever they are not caught in the two-front pitched battle crossfire with their alien neighbors' interstellar conflicts, they endure frequent assassinations, civil wars and revolutions amongst themselves. Nevertheless, terran <b>ingenuity</b> <b>and</b> unyielding stubbornness has kept them from extinction; they stand as one of the three dominant species of the galaxy.|$|E
