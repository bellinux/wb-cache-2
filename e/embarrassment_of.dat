5|$|Extravagant {{to a great}} degree, Ernest {{had many}} money {{troubles}} throughout his reign. In January 1848, Ernest visited his brother {{in the midst of}} political unrest in Germany. Upon his return, he also discovered unrest in Coburg. One of the many concerns related to finances. Although Ernest had a large inheritance, he also had frequent debts. There were increasing calls to nationalize most of his property. Indeed, Albert had to intervene at one point and spare his brother the <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> losing one of his Coburg properties.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} a {{disaster}} for the French. According to unofficial accounts, they lost approximately 900men killed or drowned and at least 300wounded, in addition to the loss of a number of the newly constructed landing craft. In France the newly appointed Minister of Marine Étienne Eustache Bruix ordered a second attempt on the islands soon afterwards but the orders were immediately countermanded by the French Directory, which did not want the <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> a second disastrous attack. Instead, Lacrosse gave orders for most of the surviving ships to be sent to Cherbourg, detachments later reaching Saint Malo and Granville. Muskein was ordered to return to Le Havre with the remainder.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Lukashenko {{was elected}} Deputy to the Supreme Council of the Republic of Belarus. He {{was the only}} deputy of the Belarusian {{parliament}} who voted against ratification of the December 1991 agreement that dissolved the Soviet Union {{and set up the}} Commonwealth of Independent States. Having acquired a reputation as an eloquent opponent of corruption, Lukashenko was elected in April 1993 to serve as the interim chairman of the anti-corruption committee of the Belarusian parliament. In late 1993 he accused 70 senior government officials, including the Supreme Soviet chairman Stanislav Shushkevich and prime minister Vyacheslav Kebich, of corruption including stealing state funds for personal purposes. While the charges were never fully proven against him, Shushkevich resigned his chairmanship due to the <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> the series of events and losing a vote of no-confidence. He served in that position until July 1994.|$|E

5|$|In August 1909, a {{group of}} army {{officers}} that had formed a military league, Stratiotikos Syndesmos, demanded, among other things, that the royal family be stripped of their military commissions. To save the King the <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> removing his sons from their commissions, they resigned them. The military league attempted a coup d'état, and the King insisted on supporting the duly elected Hellenic Parliament in response. Eventually, the military league joined forces with Venizelos in calling for a National Assembly to revise the constitution. King George gave way, and new elections to the revising assembly were held in August 1910. After some political maneuvering, Venizelos became prime minister of a minority government. Just a month later, Venizelos called new elections for , at which he won an overwhelming majority after most of the opposition parties declined to take part.|$|E
5|$|Further {{regulation}} of the Columbia's flows was necessary to make the new power plant feasible. Water storage and regulation projects in Canada would be needed, {{as well as a}} treaty resolving the many economic and political issues involved. The Bureau of Reclamation and Army Corps of Engineers explored alternatives that would not depend on a treaty with Canada, such as raising the level of Flathead Lake or Pend Oreille Lake, but both proposals faced strong local opposition. The Columbia River Treaty, which had been discussed between the U.S. and Canada since 1944, was seen as the answer. Efforts to build the Third Powerplant were also influenced by competition with the Soviet Union, which had constructed power plants on the Volga River that were larger than Grand Coulee. On , 1964, the Columbia River Treaty was ratified and included an agreement by Canada to construct the Duncan, Keenleyside, Mica Dams upstream and the U.S. would build the Libby Dam in Montana. Shortly afterward, Washington Senator Henry M. Jackson, who was influential in constructing the new power plant, announced that Reclamation would present the project to Congress for appropriation and funding. To keep up with Soviet competition and increase the generating capacity it was determined that the generators could be upgraded to much larger designs. With the possibility of international companies bidding on the project, the Soviets who had just installed a 500MW hydroelectric generator on the Yenisei River indicated their interest. To avoid the potential <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> an international rival building a domestic power plant, the Department of the Interior declined international bidding. The Third Powerplant was approved and its appropriation bill was signed by President Lyndon Johnson on , 1966.|$|E
5|$|That May, RKO {{released}} Citizen Kane, coproducing with director Orson Welles's Mercury Productions. While {{it opened}} to strong reviews and {{would go on}} to be hailed {{as one of the greatest}} movies ever made, it lost money at the time and brought down the wrath of the Hearst newspaper chain on RKO. The next year saw the commercial failure of Welles's The Magnificent Ambersons—like Kane, critically lauded and overbudget—and the expensive <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> his aborted documentary It's All True. The three Mercury productions combined to drain $2 million from the RKO coffers, major money for a corporation that had reported an overall deficit of $1 million in 1940 and a nominal profit of a bit more than $500,000 in 1941. Many of RKO's other artistically ambitious pictures were also dying at the box office and it was losing its last exclusive deal with a major star as well. Rogers, after winning an Oscar in 1941 for her performance in the previous year's Kitty Foyle, held out for a freelance contract like Grant's; after 1943, she would appear in just one more RKO production, thirteen years later. On June 17, 1942, Schaefer tendered his resignation. He departed a weakened and troubled studio, but RKO was about to turn the corner. Propelled by the box-office boom of World War II and guided by new management, RKO would make a strong comeback over the next half-decade.|$|E

25|$|The Iranian {{reaction}} to 6 April press conference was {{to dismiss the}} entire thing as propaganda and {{to claim that the}} former captives had been dictated to by the British authorities into defaming Iran to hide the <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> having violated Iranian waters.|$|E
60|$|The {{breaking}} {{out of the war}} between the United States and Great Britain multiplied the hazards and <b>embarrassments</b> <b>of</b> the enterprise.

30|$|Not surprisingly, the {{preoccupation with}} {{business}} cycles saw its {{origin in the}} study of crises. Whereas early economic historians found the roots of economic crises in “war or the fiscal <b>embarrassments</b> <b>of</b> governments,” 2 by the early twentieth century it became clear that economies experienced contractions in economic activity whose origin could not be easily determined.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{suddenly}} was Mrs Durby {{bereft of}} her treasure and thrown into abject despair.

25|$|Much like Japan and Germany, the {{aftermath}} of World War II left Italy with a destroyed economy, a divided society and anger against the monarchy for its endorsement of the Fascist regime for the previous twenty years.

25|$|By {{the end of}} 1935, {{numerous}} factors combined {{which resulted}} in the termination of the highway camps. The federal government of R. B.

However, the lack of evidence and protests would eventually lead to the early release of the men, much to the <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> the government.|$|E

25|$|Brandy Station was {{the largest}} {{predominantly}} cavalry fight of the war, and the largest to take place on American soil. It was a tactical draw, although Pleasonton withdrew before finding the location of Lee's infantry nearby and Stuart claimed a victory, attempting to disguise the <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> a cavalry force being surprised as it was by Pleasonton. The battle established the emerging reputation of the Union cavalry as a peer of the Confederate mounted arm.|$|E
25|$|On {{her next}} voyage, {{which was also}} her first transpacific crossing, the {{problems}} recurred, and when she arrived in Hong Kong, Roach suffered the <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> having his celebrated new vessel declared unseaworthy by the British authorities. Roach was forced to dispatch a team of workmen to effect on-the-spot repairs, and he now found himself denigrated in the American press as a builder of inferior ships.

25|$|Pardew {{moved to}} Charlton Athletic in November 1991, and was Charlton's top scorer in the 1992–93 season with ten goals.

He {{played in the}} team who suffered the <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> being involved in Spurs' record defeat {{in the history of}} the club, when they lost 8–0 away to German side 1. FC Köln. Spurs had fielded a team made up of reserves and loanees, including Pardew, for their final group game in Cologne.|$|E

40|$|The {{experience}} <b>of</b> <b>embarrassment</b> {{provides a}} highly salient cue {{for the human}} moral apparatus. Interestingly, people also experience <b>embarrassment</b> on behalf <b>of</b> others' inappropriate conditions. The perceiver's embarrassment often lacks an equivalent expression <b>of</b> <b>embarrassment</b> in the social counterpart. The present study examines this phenomenon and distinguishes neural circuits involved in embarrassment with and embarrassment for another person's mishaps. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that the <b>embarrassment</b> on behalf <b>of</b> others engages the temporal pole and the medial prefrontal cortex, central structures of the mentalizing network, together with the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast, sharing others' embarrassment additionally stimulated the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS), which exhibited increased functional integration with inferior parietal and insular cortex areas. These findings characterize common neural circuits involved in the embodied representation <b>of</b> <b>embarrassment</b> and further unravel the unique role of the posterior STS in sharing others' affective state...|$|R

25|$|Macaulay was Secretary to the Board of Control under Lord Grey from 1832 until 1833. The {{financial}} <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> {{his father}} meant that Macaulay became the sole {{means of support}} for his family and needed a more remunerative post than he could hold as an MP. After {{the passing of the}} Government of India Act 1833, he resigned as MP for Leeds and was appointed as the first Law Member of the Governor-General's Council.

25|$|Ethnicity, age, education, employment, marital status, and {{location}} are reported factors of delayed breastfeeding and infant under nutrition. Low- income mothers are specifically {{at risk for}} under nutrition and high mortality rates amongst their infants because they replace breast milk with formula. They {{do so because they}} lack a supportive environment, <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> nursing, or the need to return to school or work. About 16.5% of low-income mothers breastfed for the recommended time. Studies suggest that scarce financial and social resources are consistent with the high mortality rates amongst the infants of low-income mothers.|$|E
25|$|Visiting {{politicians}} and senior bureaucrats from South Asian countries {{are known to}} lack basic sense of social decorum and diplomatic finesse while on official representation. Lack of preparation in diplomatic protocol, cultural norms, culinary skills and restroom etiquette makes them prone to committing faux-pas to the <b>embarrassment</b> <b>of</b> their hosts, muted helplessness of embassy staff and amusement of the press-corps. Chinese officials are known {{to pay attention to}} their outward appearance and practice their roles/actions which are carefully choreographed before-hand to the minutest detail. In June 2015, an Indian Parliamentary delegation invited to the European Parliament in Brussels included a delegate who wore sports shoes to a meeting with the President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz.|$|E

50|$|He {{gathered}} together forty-five musicians from the depot of the Gardes Françaises, and they formed the nucleus {{for the music}} of the Garde Nationale, with François Joseph Gossec as artistic director. In May 1790, the municipality of Paris increased the body to seventy-eight musicians. When the financial <b>embarrassments</b> <b>of</b> the Commune necessitated the suppression of the paid guard, Sarrette kept the musicians near him and obtained from the municipality, in June 1792, the establishment of a free school of music.|$|R

Patience and sufferance were indeed strongly imposed on him by circumstances; but at length it became scarcely possible to observe their dictates any longer.|$|R
