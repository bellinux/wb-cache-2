40|$|The {{evolution}} of a deep North Atlantic cyclone, which caused devastating avalanches in northwest (NW) Iceland in October 1995, was investigated. As the main tool for this investigation, potential vorticity analysis was used. This allows the quantification and comparison of the roles of different processes {{that contribute to the}} cyclone deepening at different stages. Interpretation of potential vorticity inversions and isentropic air trajectories yields the following picture of the cyclone development. The thermal field over the North Atlantic had acquired strong west–east gradients due to a combination of advection of cold air southeastward from a cold cyclonic gyre south of Iceland and advection of warm air northward on the westward flank of a warm anticyclonic ridge over central Europe. A low-level baroclinic wave forming just south of Ireland was rapidly reinforced due to interaction with a descending, high-value, upper-level potential vorticity anomaly and was isentropically advected from the low south of Iceland. As the wave deepened, diabatic heating in association with the frontal systems became a major source of cyclonic vorticity. Cross sections of the height fields associated with potential vorticity anomalies reveal the baroclinic nature of some of the anomalies. The <b>isentropic</b> trajectory <b>analysis</b> shows strong ascent of warm air taking place over Iceland and thereby explaining the heavy precipitation in NW Iceland. The advection of rather warm, humid air overlying very cold air from a persistent high over Greenland, together with orographic lifting, seems to be responsible for the snowfall that together with heavy winds produced the unusual avalanches in Iceland. 1...|$|R
40|$|Two {{fundamental}} {{perspectives on}} the dynamics of midlatitude weather systems are provided by potential vorticity (PV) and the omega equation. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the link between the two perspectives, which has so far received very little attention in the meteorological literature. It also aims to give a quantitative basis for discussion of quasi-geostrophic vertical motion in terms of components associated with system movement, maintaining a constant thermal structure, and with the development of that structure. The former links with the <b>isentropic</b> relative-flow <b>analysis</b> technique. Viewed in a moving frame of reference, the measured development of a system depends on the velocity of that frame of reference. The requirement that the development should be a minimum provides a quantitative method for determining the optimum system velocity. The component of vertical velocity associated with development is shown to satisfy an omega equation with forcing determined from the relative advection of interior PV and boundary temperature. The analysis carries through in the presence of diabatic heating provided the omega equation forcing is based on the interior PV and boundary thermal tendencies, including the heating effect. The analysis is shown to be possible also at the level of the semi-geostrophic approximation. The analysis technique is applied to a number of idealized problems that can be considered to be building blocks for midlatitude synoptic-scale dynamics. They focus on the influences of interior PV, boundary temperature, an interior boundary, baroclinic instability associated with two boundaries, and also diabatic heating. In each case, insights yielded by the new perspective are sought into the dynamical behaviour, especially that related to vertical motion. Copyright © 2003 Royal Meteorological Societ...|$|R

40|$|On 20 th March 1994 at 12 Z two dry layers {{with high}} ozone mixing ratio were {{encountered}} in the free troposphere by an ozonesonde ascent at Aberystwyth (52. 4 °N, 4. 1 °W). The layers resembled tropopause folds, but were not associated with any significant synoptic development, {{and did not have}} enhanced static stability. We use <b>isentropic</b> trajectory <b>analysis,</b> with winds taken from ECMWF analyses, to look for the origin of the layers. The analysis suggests that the two layers had different source regions. The lower layer spent 10 days over the Atlantic before reaching Northern Europe, and appears to have originated in the break-up of a stratospheric streamer between the 5 th and 9 th of March. The upper layer seems to have originated over the Western USA where the trajectories passed through a region of low Richardson number above the Rocky Mountains. In both cases, the low-water-vapour/high-ozone air mass had been advected with little mixing in the troposphere for at least 10 days. We argue that the air must be of stratospheric origin, since photo-chemistry cannot generate large amounts of ozone {{at this time of year}} and the trajectories do not, in any case, point to a boundary-layer origin. If, as the analysis suggests, the upper layer reached the troposphere by mixing across the jet then this may be evidence for stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) taking place other than by folding of the tropopause. The persistence of layers with anomalous chemical content in the troposphere for so long indicates that an accurate model of tropospheric transport and mixing is needed to assess the chemical impact of STE on tropospheric chemistry, in addition to a representation of the dynamical behaviour near to the tropopause.

The emphasis of this research effort was on the application of <b>isentropic</b> modeling and <b>analysis</b> to advance {{the accuracy of the}} simulation of all aspects of the hydrologic cycle including clouds and thus the climate state regionally and globally. Simulation of atmospheric hydrologic processes by the UW hybrid isentropic coordinate models provided fundamental insight into global monsoonal circulations, and regional energy exchange in relation to the atmospheric hydrologic cycle. Inter-comparison of UW hybrid model simulations with those from the NCAR Community Climate Model and other climate and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models investigated the increased accuracies gained in modeling long-range transport in isentropic coordinates and isolated differences in modeling of the climate state.

40|$|Hurricanes, {{like many}} other {{atmospheric}} flows, are associated with turbulent motions {{over a wide range}} of scales. Here the authors adapt a new technique based on the <b>isentropic</b> <b>analysis</b> of convective motions to study the thermodynamic structure of the overturning circulation in hurricane simulations. This approach separates the vertical mass transport in terms of the equivalent potential temperature of air parcels. In doing so, one separates the rising air parcels at high entropy from the subsiding air at low entropy. This technique filters out oscillatory motions associated with gravity waves and separates convective overturning from the secondary circulation. This approach is applied here to study the flow of an idealized hurricane simulation with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. The isentropic circulation for a hurricane exhibits similar characteristics to that of moist convection, with a maximum mass transport near the surface associated with a shallow convection and entrainment. There are also important differences. For instance, ascent in the eyewall can be readily identified in the <b>isentropic</b> <b>analysis</b> as an upward mass flux of air with unusually high equivalent potential temperature. The isentropic circulation is further compared here to the Eulerian secondary circulation of the simulated hurricane to show that the mass transport in the isentropic circulation is much larger than the one in secondary circulation. This difference can be directly attributed to the mass transport by convection in the outer rainband and confirms that, even for a strongly organized flow like a hurricane, most of the atmospheric overturning is tied to the smaller scales...|$|E

To begin it is demonstrated that a thermo-damage model can be presented in a thermodynamic framework with the evolution equations satisfying the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The equations of evolution are partitioned in two ways, thus defining two fractional step methods: an isothermal method and an isentropic method. When implemented into a time-stepping algorithm the isentropic method maintains a precise energy balance for the entire analysis where as the isothermal method can only provide an energy balance {{at the end of each}} thermal time step.

Since ozone is a good passive tracer at cruise altitudes, the results provide a strong diagnostic for scalar advection theories and models. Calculations of structure functions and increment probability distribution functions show that ozone variability scales anomalously from ∼ 2 to ∼ 2000 km, although not continuously in this interval. We find no evidence for the simple scaling predicted for smooth advection/diffusion, even at the large scales. At mesoscales the upper tropospheric ozone field is rougher and more intermittent than in the lower stratosphere. Within the troposphere the equatorial ozone field is rougher than at higher latitudes, and the intermittency decreases with increasing latitude.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of a spontaneous sudden stratospheric warming that occurred during a 2 -year integration of the Langley Research Center (LaRC) Atmospheric Simulation Model is presented. The simulated warming resembles observed 'wave 1 ' warmings in the Northern Hemisphere stratosphere and provides an opportunity to investigate the radiative and dynamical processes occurring during the warming event. <b>Isentropic</b> <b>analysis</b> of potential vorticity sources and sinks indicates that dynamically induced departures from radiative equilibrium {{play an important role}} in the warming event. Enhanced radiative cooling associated with a series of upper stratospheric warm pools leads to radiative dampening within the polar vortex. Within the 'surf zone' large-scale radiative cooling leads to diabatic advection of high potential vorticity air from aloft. Lagrangian area diagnostics of the simulated warming agree well with Limb Infrared Monitor of the Stratosphere (LIMS) analyses. Dynamical mixing is shown to account for the majority of the decrease in the size of the polar vortex during the simulated warming.

40|$|Tropospheric {{transport}} can {{be described}} qualitatively by the slow mean diabatic circulation and rapid isentropic mixing, yet a quantitative understanding of the transport circulation is complicated, as {{nearly half of the}} isentropic surfaces in the troposphere frequently intersect the ground. A theoretical framework for the effective isentropic diffusivity of tropospheric transport is presented. Compared with previous <b>isentropic</b> <b>analysis</b> of effective diffusivity, a new diagnostic is introduced to quantify the eddy diffusivity of the near-surface isentropic flow. This diagnostic also links the effective eddy diffusivity directly to a diffusive closure of eddy fluxes through a finite-amplitude wave activity equation. The theory is examined in a dry primitive equation model on the sphere. It is found that the upper troposphere is characterized by a diffusivity minimum at the jet’s center with enhanced mixing at the jet’s flanks and that the lower troposphere is dominated by stronger mixing throughout the baroclinic zone. This structure of isentropic diffusivity is generally consistent with the diffusivity obtained from the geostrophic component of the flow. Furthermore, the isentropic diffusivity agrees broadly with the tracer equivalent length obtained from either a spectral diffusion scheme or a semi-Lagrangian advection scheme, indicating that the effective diffusivity of tropospheric transport is largely dictated by large-scale stirring rather than details of the small-scale diffusion acting on the tracers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the convective mass transport by sorting air parcels {{in terms of}} their equivalent potential temperature to determine an isentropic streamfunction. By averaging the vertical mass flux at a constant value of the equivalent potential temperature, one can compute an isentropic mass transport that filters out reversible oscillatory motions such as gravity waves. This novel approach emphasizes the fact that the vertical energy and entropy transports by convection are due to the combination of ascending air parcels with high energy and entropy and subsiding air parcels with lower energy and entropy. Such conditional averaging can be extended to other dynamic and thermodynamic variables such as vertical velocity, temperature, or relative humidity to obtain a comprehensive description of convective motions. It is also shown how this approach can be used to determine the mean diabatic tendencies from the three-dimensional dynamic and thermodynamic fields. A two-stream approximation that partitions the isentropic circulation into a mean updraft and a mean downdraft is also introduced. This offers a straightforward way to identify the mean properties of rising and subsiding air parcels. The results from the two-stream approximation are compared with two other definitions of the cloud mass flux. It is argued that the <b>isentropic</b> <b>analysis</b> offers a robust definition of the convective mass transport that is not tainted by the need to arbitrarily distinguish between convection and its environment, and that separates the irreversible convective overturning fromoscillations associated with gravity waves...|$|E

The development of the cyclone occurred as a pre-existent midtroposphericcut-off low, over the Pacific Ocean, which propagated crossing over the Andes {{at the same time as}} a strongthermal advection was observed to the west of the mountain ridge. The synoptic analysis of this caserevealed that this event can be “classified” as a lee cyclogenesis, since the existence of the mountain barrierwas fundamental for the intensification of the surface baroclinicity, which, in turn, led to the formation of theextratropical cyclone. Also, the Andes defined the vertical tilt of the system to the west, favoring the cyclonicvorticity advection at higher levels above the warm thermal advection at low levels, and it defined the finalbaroclinic configuration that fed the system in its greater development stage. By using potential vorticityinversion, it was possible to evaluate quantitatively the relative contributions of upper- and low-level potentialvorticity, as well as bottom temperature anomalies.

In this perspective an atmospheric modelling system based on the chemical transport model FARM has been applied for the year 2005 over a nested domain including the metropolitan area. To improve the description of local scale atmospheric circulation characteristics, observational meteorological data are analysed using the <b>Isentropic</b> <b>Analysis</b> package (ISAN). Since urban traffic emissions represent a relevant source of pollutants, hourly emissions coming from this sector have been estimated by means of a traffic assignment model, based on a source-destination approach, coupled with an emission model based on COPERT- 3 methodology. The emissions from the other sectors have been derived from the national inventory and then disaggregated at the municipal level. The analysis of model results for the year 2005 against experimental data reveals a good agreement suggesting the use of the modelling system to study the impact on the air quality of different emission control strategies at both regional and urban scales. The 2010 has been considered as the future year base case scenario and the traffic limitation within the Rome urban core has been considered as an emission control action. The impact of this emission scenario has been then analysed by means of a semi-empiric approach: a significant decrease of PM 10 and NO 2 yearly average concentrations is expected to occur at urban traffic stations while the minimum reduction is expected at urban background and rural stations...|$|E

Using isentropic diagnostics, {{results from a}} three-dimensional numerical simulation of an SCS are examined to study the isallobaric flow field, modes of dominant ageostrophic motion, and stability changes {{in relation to the}} mutual interdependence of adiabatic processes and latent heat release. <b>Isentropic</b> <b>analysis</b> affords an explicit isolation of a component of isallobaric flow associated with diabatic processes within the SCS. Prior to convective development within the simulations, atmospheric destabilization occurs through adiabatic ageostrophic mass adjustment and low-level convergence in association with the preexisting synoptic-scale upper-tropospheric jet streak. The SCS develops in a baroclinic zone and quickly initiates a vigorous mass circulation. By the mature stage, a pronounced vertical couplet of low-level convergence and upper-level mass divergence is established, linked by intense midtropospoheric diabatic heating. Significant divergence persists aloft for several hours subsequent to SCS decay. The dominant role of ageostrophic motion within which the low-level mass convergence develops is the adiabatic isallobaric component, while the mass divergence aloft develops principally through the diabatic isallobaric component. Both compnents are intrinsically linked to the convectively forced vertical mass transport. The inertial diabatic ageostrophic component is largest near the level of maximum heating and is responsible for the development of inertial instability to the north of SCS, resulting in this quadrant being preferred for outflow.

Large K yy values, marking regions of more efficient mixing, have been found in the subtropical vertical band of weak westerly wind and in mid-latitudes in regions of upward-propagating baroclinic wave activity in the middle and upper troposphere. Based on the ECMWF data and results of baroclinic-wave behaviour, strong indications are presented that positive zonally averaged PV flux polewards of the jet core in the NH is strengthened by stationary waves and nonlinear effects. Reduced eddy transport is apparent in winter and spring slightly below the subtropical tropopause jet. The seasonal cycle of K yy from ECHAM 3 data is to a great extent in agreement with the result based on ECMWF analysis. In the model, reduced interannual variability enlarges the height-latitude range where sign of K yy is significant...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} a synoptic and dynamic {{analysis of a}} cyclogenesis event that occurred between July 8 and 9, 1996, over Uruguay, {{in the region of}} maximum frequency of cyclogenesis as detected in previous studies. The study is based on isobaric and <b>isentropic</b> <b>analysis</b> of meteorological variables, and also, on potential vorticity perspective. The development of the cyclone occurred as a pre-existent midtropospheric cut-off low, over the Pacific Ocean, which propagated crossing over the Andes {{at the same time as}} a strong thermal advection was observed to the west of the mountain ridge. The synoptic analysis of this case revealed that this event can be "classified" as a lee cyclogenesis, since the existence of the mountain barrier was fundamental for the intensification of the surface baroclinicity, which, in turn, led to the fori-nation of the extratropical cyclone. Also, the Andes defined the vertical tilt of the system to the west, favoring the cyclonic vorticity advection at higher levels above the warm thermal advection at low levels, and it defined the final baroclinic configuration that fed the system in its greater development stage. By using potential vorticity inversion, it was possible to evaluate quantitatively the relative contributions of upper- and low-level potential vorticity, as well as bottom temperature anomalies. It was observed that the bottom temperature anomaly was important in the initial development stages, contributing to almost 100 % of the total circulation. As the surface cyclone deepened, the contributions of low- and upper- level anomalies became greater. In the stage of maximum development of the system, a phase-locking at low and upper levels seems to occur, where the upper-level advection of cyclonic vorticity, inducing northeasterly flow at surface, had the greater contribution.
