For example, it is a main purification technique for removing organic impurities from bright nickel plating solutions. A variety of organic chemicals are added to plating solutions for improving their deposit qualities and for enhancing properties like brightness, smoothness, ductility, etc. Due to passage of direct current and electrolytic reactions of anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction, organic additives generate unwanted breakdown products in solution.

Hexavalent chrome plating baths have a long history for producing heavy, corrosion resistant and mechanically hard coatings. However, the process is slow, varies in thickness according to the shape of the object, and produces extremely toxic waste. Plating from trivalent baths is commonly used for thinner, decorative finishes. It can be faster, more uniform, and with lower disposal costs but requires more careful controls during the process.|$|E

50|$|A {{black smoker}} or deep sea vent {{is a type}} of {{hydrothermal}} vent found on the seabed, typically in the abyssal and hadal zones at spreading centers. They appear as black, chimney-like structures that emit a cloud of black material. Black smokers typically emit particles with high levels of sulfur-bearing minerals, or sulfides. Black smokers are formed in fields hundreds of meters wide when superheated water from below Earth's crust comes through the ocean floor (water may attain temperatures above 400 °C). This water is rich in dissolved minerals from the crust, most notably sulfides. When it comes in contact with cold ocean water, many minerals precipitate, forming a black, chimney-like structure around each vent. The <b>deposited</b> <b>metal</b> sulfides can become massive sulfide ore deposits in time.|$|E

50|$|Welder {{certification}} {{is based}} on specially designed tests to determine a welder's skill and ability to deposit sound weld metal. The {{main part of the}} welder's test consists of welding one or more test coupons which are then examined using non-destructive and destructive methods. The extent of certification is described by a number of variables, which include the specific welding process, type of <b>deposited</b> <b>metal,</b> thickness, joint design, position, backing, and others. Most often, the test is conducted in accordance with a particular code. Depending on product requirements the test can be administered under the auspices of a national or international organization, such as the American Welding Society (AWS), or American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), but manufacturers may specify their own standards and requirements as well. Most certifications expire after a certain time limit, and have different requirements for renewal or extension of the certification.|$|E
50|$|FIB {{tools are}} {{designed}} to etch or machine surfaces, an ideal FIB might machine away one atom layer without any disruption of the atoms in the next layer, or any residual disruptions above the surface. Yet currently because of the sputter the machining typically roughens surfaces at the sub-micrometer length scales. A FIB {{can also be used}} to deposit material via ion beam induced deposition. FIB-assisted chemical vapor deposition occurs when a gas, such as tungsten hexacarbonyl (W(CO)6) is introduced to the vacuum chamber and allowed to chemisorb onto the sample. By scanning an area with the beam, the precursor gas will be decomposed into volatile and non-volatile components; the non-volatile component, such as tungsten, remains on the surface as a deposition. This is useful, as the <b>deposited</b> <b>metal</b> can be used as a sacrificial layer, to protect the underlying sample from the destructive sputtering of the beam. From nanometers to hundred of micrometers in length, tungsten metal deposition allows metal lines to be put right where needed. Other materials such as platinum, cobalt, carbon, gold, etc., can also be locally deposited. Gas assisted deposition and FIB etching process are shown below.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{microstructure}} and wear-resistance of {{the welding}} <b>deposited</b> <b>metal</b> of Fe-Ti-Nb-V-C and Fe-Cr-W-Mo-C alloy system (with American MG 700 as example) are studyed by using SEM, TEM and MM 200 wear testing machine. It is revealed that Ti and Nb promote {{the formation of}} dispersed MC type carbide granules, while the carbides of Cr and W or Mo tend to precipitate along grain boundary. The formation of MC carbide granules depletes the carbon content in the matrix, and then low carbon martensite matrix can be achieved. The hard and tough matrix and the granular carbides improve the wear-resistance of the <b>deposited</b> <b>metal.</b> But excessive Ti and Nb induce the formation of bigger granules with sharp corner and result too soft matrix, then the wear-resistance decrease. As to the Fe-Cr-W-Mo-C alloy system, network carbides and high carbon martensite matrix make the <b>deposited</b> <b>metal</b> very brittle.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that if {{choosing}} a metal composition for surfacing rolls and rollers of continuous casting machines, both the carbon impact on the mechanical and functional properties and the critical values of the chromium concentration, which determine the corrosion resistance of the metal with regard to electrochemical corrosion theory, should be considered as well. The paper studied the effect of chromium and carbon steel the X 5 -X 12 type on the structure, technological strength, mechanical properties, fracturing resistance and corrosion resistance of the weld metal. The composition of chromium tool steels (<b>deposited</b> <b>metal)</b> (X 5 -used for the rolls of hot rolling mills) and (X 12 -used for continuous casting machines rollers) correspond to these values. The impact of carbon on the properties of the <b>deposited</b> <b>metal</b> containing chromium was considered by comparing the data for both types of the <b>deposited</b> <b>metal.</b> It was found that for both types of the <b>deposited</b> <b>metal</b> (X 5 and X 12), the limiting value of the carbon content, providing an optimal combination of strength, ductility, failure resistance is the same. If the carbon content is more than the limiting value – (0, 25 %) the technological strength and failure resistance of the <b>deposited</b> <b>metal</b> significantly reduce. With increasing carbon content from 0, 18 to 0, 25 % the martensite structure has a mixed morphology – lath and plate. The strength and toughness of the <b>deposited</b> <b>metal</b> grow. Of particular interest is simultaneous increase in the specific work of failure resulted from crack inhibition at the boundary with far less solid and more ductile ferrite. As for the 5 % chromium metal, the X 12 type composition with 0, 25 % C, is borderline. With a further increase in the carbon content of the metal both ductility and failure resistance sharply decrease and with 0, 40 % C the growth rate of fatigue crack increases by almost 1, 5 time...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} stated that {{electrode}} shape and heat input {{relates to the}} arc motion, thermal cycles, the weld pool molten metal crystallization rate and <b>deposited</b> <b>metal</b> microstructure. Surfacing performed with perpendicular and longitudinal ribbon electrodes results in coarse-grained and non-uniform microstructure of the <b>deposited</b> <b>metal.</b> Surfacing made with wire and composite electrodes leads to the microstructure refinement, it becoming small-dispersed and uniform. The electrode shape is the main parameter determining the deposition process, since the arc moving along the butt end of the electrode gets concentrated when surfacing is made with wire and dissipates when surfacing is made with a ribbon electrode, according to its movement either along the longitudinal axis or transverse the weld pool. The arc movement determines heat input in the pool, heating and cooling rates of the molten metal and heat affected zone; surfacing regime being constant. This changes the crystallization conditions of the weld pool, diffusion processes, structural and phase transformations [1, 2], and the <b>deposited</b> <b>metal</b> quality. However, {{the influence of the}} electrode shape on the <b>deposited</b> <b>metal</b> quality was not investigated properly. It has been proved both through experiments and calculations that when surfacing rate is high and heat input is low, heating and cooling rates increase, the number of crystallization centers grows too and they, lying in front of the growing crystals, slow down their further growth. Deposition rate increasing, the crystallization rate of the weld pool molten metal grows in proportion to it, microstructure gets reduced, welding stresses decrease, these processes resulting in the welded joints toughness increase as well as the cracking resistance of the <b>deposited</b> <b>metal.</b> The process of energy-saving high-speed deposition with low heat input, which provides increase in the heating, cooling and crystallization rates, microstructure reduction, welding stresses decrease and metallurgical equipment parts cracking resistance increase has been develope...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the types}} of {{hydrogen}} degradation of steel welded joints is cold cracking. The direct cause of the formation of cold cracks is simultaneous presence of hydrogen, residual stresses and brittle structure. The way of preventing the occurring of degradation is to eliminate {{at least one of these}} factors.
