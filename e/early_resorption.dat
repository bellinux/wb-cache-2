30|$|Various {{surgical}} interventions {{have been}} described. Some procedures aim to provide symptomatic relief {{and limit the}} extent of the lesion, whilst others attempt to correct the varus deformity and provide mechanical support. Traditionally, patients with FD lesions in the proximal femur underwent intra-lesional curettage and filling with autogenous bone graft. Initial attempts with cancellous bone grafts resulted in <b>early</b> graft <b>resorption</b> and recurrence of the lesions [9, 10]. Better results have been achieved with cortical bone graft. Enneking and Gearen reported <b>early</b> graft <b>resorption</b> in only two cases from a series of 15 patients. In all other cases, good symptom relief was obtained, with no further fracture or progression of deformity. However, Guille et al. [11] in their long-term follow-up of 27 cases reported that all their bone grafts, cancellous and cortical, were resorbed and no lesion was eradicated or reduced. In addition, they argued that intra-lesional curettage disrupts the modest trabecular support that remains and further weakens the bone.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{pregnancy}} on lactation was studied {{during the third}} week of lactational pregnancy in postpartum pregnant rats with a delay in implantation of only 1 day (1 d-LP rats). In an experimental design in which the suckling litter was prevented from consuming solid food, lactational performance was estimated by weighing the ten-pup suckling litters on days 16 - 21 of lactation or by measuring maternal weight loss after a nursing spell on day 21. In 1 d-LP rats, food consumption as well as lactational performance was lower than it was in nonpregnant lactating rats (L rats) and pregnant-lactating rats with a normal long delay of implantation of at least 6 days (LP rats). The time spent by the pups sucking at the nipples was not different among the three groups, but the number of milk ejections was diminished in 1 d-LP dams. Restriction of daily food supply during days 16 to 21 of lactation diminished lactational performance more strongly in 1 d-LP rats than it did in L rats; 1 d-LP rats conserved protein stores and mobilized fewer minerals than did L rats. The weight and composition of the litter in utero were not affected by the food restriction. Ln pregnant-lactating rats (LP and 1 d-LP rats), the number of <b>early</b> <b>resorptions</b> was increased in comparison with pregnant rats, showing that lactation can affect the earlier stages of pregnancy.

30|$|Postoperative {{morbidity}} after mandibular bone harvesting procedures {{was reported}} to be mainly related to temporary or permanent neural disturbances involving the inferior alveolar nerve and its branches [19]. In this study, only the incidence of the temporary hypoesthesia of the mandibular and lingual nerve after harvesting from the retromolar area could be detected. It was 10.4 and 2.8 %, respectively, results that are suitable to the literature [9, 47]. No consistent nerve damage could be detected. All of them made a complete recovery over the short and medium term. The use of piezoelectric surgery may reduce the incidence of this complication offering a safer way of safely removing hard tissue without damaging soft tissue. However, it should not be forgotten that piezoelectric surgery has some critical disadvantages, including a longer operation time and heat generation during bone cutting [48]. Based on our study results, however, we can recommend this technique as a safe method to prevent nerve damage in autologous intraoral bone harvesting. More histological studies are needed to define the quality of the retromolar bone and its resorption in the follow-up evaluation. That could minimize the <b>early</b> <b>resorption</b> rate and optimize the surgical outcome.|$|E

40|$|About 40 % {{of human}} pregnancies are {{unsuccessful}} {{and many of}} these are thought to be genetically normal. Our hypothesis is that decidual NK cells in abortion prone pregnancies produce IFN-gamma which primes macrophages. These primed macrophages are then triggered by a second signal to become the major effectors in <b>early</b> embryo <b>resorption.</b> Analysis of individual implantation sites was performed at day 9 of pregnancy to determine the cytokine profile of these NK cells and if NK cells selectively infiltrate the decidua of embryos that will undergo resorption. Use of a pan-NK cell marker (DX 5) allowed labeling of decidual NK cells for flow cytometric analysis. Magnetic labeling and isolation of DX 5 + cells from individual embryos was followed by RT-PCR and southern blot analysis. This thesis prevents evidence that a number of the embryos are infiltrated by higher numbers of DX 5 + NK-cells with an incidence that is similar to the occurrence of early embryo loss in this experimental model.

40|$|Although in {{the last}} few years in general the {{biocompatibility}} of biomaterials has significantly improved, unwanted tissue reactions are often observed resulting in <b>early</b> <b>resorption</b> of the biomaterial, loosening of the implant or in a chronic (immunologic) response.

In this part of the study the role of macrophages is studied with and without depletion by use of the liposomes-mediated macrophage suicide technique. Crosslinked dermal sheep collagens were used as biodegradable test materials. The results showed that macrophage depletion increases vascularization, and decreases the infiltration of granulocytess into the collagens. The foreign body reaction, i. e. the infiltration of macrophages and giant cells was significantly inhibited, resulting in a strongly delayed degradation time of the biomaterials. However, macrophage depletion did not inhibit attraction of fibroblasts and even resulted in increased formation of autologous rat-collagen, which improved the biocompatibility and the function of the biomaterials as a tempory scaffold...|$|E

The results showed that T cells or T cell-related factors played a prominent role in the attraction of macrophages and the formation of giant-cells, their antigen presentation, and their phagocytotic capacity. As a consequence, degradation of HDSC was strongly delayed. This study also showed that infiltration of fibroblasts and creation of stromal areas in HDSC was restricted to areas subjected to degradation. However, in time, absence of T cells resulted in increased formation and maturation of autologous rat collagen. Results obtained suggest that the inflammatory reaction to biomaterials might be modulated by controlling T-cell activation. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|E

Two sheep in each group were sacrificed at 6, 18 and 26 weeks. Successful bone graft incorporation was evident in both groups by six weeks but in the OP- 1 group, there had been more extensive resorption of the graft. There was one case of excessive stem subsidence in the OP- 1 group at six weeks. By 18 weeks, there was remodelling and trabeculation of the new bone in the OP- 1 group, but this appeared less advanced in the control group. By 26 weeks, there was remodelling of bone in the graft bed. The results of this small study suggest that OP- 1 promotes initial graft resorption, thus hastening bone graft incorporation and remodelling in femoral impaction grafting.

To improve longterm results of therapy for thrombosis of deep veins of the lower extremities, {{it is important to}} restore venous function and outflow. Anticoagulant therapy with low weight or non-fractionated heparin preparations remains the most widely used method of management. However, total or partial thrombosis resolution under anticoagulant treatment is achieved only in 4 and 14 % of cases, respectively. Thrombolysis allows for <b>early</b> <b>resorption</b> of the thrombus by means of a minimally invasive procedure with lower risk of complication. After the venous flow is restored, the aim of treatment is to prevent damage to the venous valves, venous hypertension and repeated thrombosis with development of the post-thrombotic syndrome. Compared to anticoagulation, systemic thrombolysis has the benefit of more rapid clot resorption and less damage to the venous valve. One of its serious limitations is a high bleeding risk related to higher doses of the drug administered through a peripheral vein catheter. Therefore, selective intra-clot administration of thombolytics (direct catheter thrombolysis) has been suggested as an alternative. For more effective therapy with the use of lower doses of thrombolytics, the so called pharmaco-mechanical thrombectomy has been developed.

Human adipose-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) grafts have been reported to form new adipose tissue and have greater biostability than autologous fat graft. Here, we present an injectable hydrogel that is constructed from adipose tissue derived soluble extracellular matrix (sECM) and methylcellulose (MC) for use in vocal fold augmentation. Human sECM derived from adipose tissue was extracted using two major steps-ECM was isolated from human adipose tissue and was subsequently solubilized.

Epidemiological {{studies have shown}} that the incidence of FORL increases with age, and premolars and molars are the most commonly affected teeth. However, the aetiological mechanisms of tooth destruction in FORL are unknown. In this study, the normal surface anatomy of the tooth, and the surface features of early and advanced FORL were described using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The local expression of mediators involved in the differentiation and activity of osteoclasts in teeth was investigated using RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. Markers of bone turnover were measured in serum and urine to assess systemic processes of bone formation and resorption in normal cats and in cats affected with FORL. SEM demonstrated that the enamel at the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) of the tooth was thinner than at other sites. There was reduced mineralisation of enamel and dentine at this location, potentially predisposing it to damage by resorption. In radiographically normal teeth, <b>early</b> <b>resorption</b> occurred most frequently at the CEJ, and involved enamel. This was the only region of the tooth that did not show evidence of repair, providing compelling evidence for the CEJ-origin of FORL. Resorption was prevalent among young animals, indicating that the initiation of disease occurs early in life. mRNA expression of interleukin- IP and interleukin- 6 was elevated in teeth affected with FORL. mRNA and protein expression of Receptor Activator of NFKB (RANKL) was elevated in normal teeth and gingiva, while osteoprotegerin (OPG) was elevated in teeth and gingiva affected with FORL. The presence or severity of FORL was not associated with alterations in bone turnover markers, indicating that the stimulus for resorption occurs locally in the tooth microenvironment. This study has identified a number of factors that may be important in the pathogenesis of FORL, including features of the CEJ and changes in the expression of local cytokines in the tooth microenvironment; however, FORL does not appear to be associated with systemic alterations in bone cell activity.

However, in cultures of Brazil nut, so {{little is known about the}} effect of the landscape in the community of bees flowers visitors and the interactions between the resources offered by the plant and their interaction with their pollinators. Thus, this project aims to understand the role of nectar in pollination of Brazil nut trees and study the effect of the surrounding planting systems on the visitation of potential pollinators to Bertholletia excelsa under cultivation in central Amazonia rain forest. The experiment was conducted between the months of October to December 2009 and 2010 in an area of 3600 ha of farming the Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa), belonging to Agricultural AruanÃ, located in Itacoatiara, Amazonas state. The results showed that the flowers of B. excelsa already proffer nectar from anthesis (14. 48 &# 956;l, 38. 74 % and 6. 56 mg of sugar), with a pattern of secretion volume and the amount of sugar continued and increasing until 15 : 30 h and 13 : 30 h, respectively, increasing rates of 2. 10 / hour and 0. 69 mg / hour. After these times, for each variable, there was a reduction in the rate of secretion, featuring <b>early</b> <b>resorption</b> process. In contrast, the concentration of solute concentration was decreasing after 7 : 30 h while maintaining similar values (p> 0. 01) throughout the morning and afternoon superior to, coincident with the peak activity of the bees. Despite the pattern of nectar secretion show higher values of volume and amount of sugar in the afternoon, under natural conditions of visitation of the study area almost all the nectar was collected in the morning yet, due to the high activity of visitors influenced by conditions temperature. All flower visitors sampled except Megachile sp., Have characteristics of size glossa meets morphological structure of flowers, providing success in collecting nectar and potentially in the pollination process of chestnut. The area with a population capoeira remained abundant and richer than capoeira without (p 0. 05), both in the environment and in poultry without the roost, despite having been checked several populations in this environment. Thus, we conclude that there seems to be a synchronism between the pattern of nectar secretion and activity of floral visitors and potential pollinators, increasing the chances of reproductive success by bee-plant interactions. We can also conclude that the system of land management that keeps tracks of secondary vegetation "capoeira" inside the plant maintains a greater richness and abundance of pollinating bees, thereby increasing pollination and yield of the crop.

A pesquisa foi conduzida entre os meses de outubro a dezembro de 2009 e 2010 em uma Ãrea com 3600 ha de cultivo de castanheira-do-brasil, pertencente a AgropecuÃria AruanÃ, localizada no municÃpio de Itacoatiara, estado do Amazonas. Os resultados mostraram que as flores de B. excelsa jÃ ofertam nÃctar desde a antese (14, 48 &# 956;l, 38, 74 % e 6, 56 mg de aÃÃcar), com um padrÃo de secreÃÃo do volume e da quantidade de aÃÃcar contÃnuo e crescente atÃ as 15 : 30 h e 13 : 30 h, respectivamente, aumentando a taxas de 2, 10 &# 956;l/hora e 0, 69 mg/hora. ApÃs esses horÃrios, para cada variÃvel, observou-se reduÃÃo nas taxas de secreÃÃo, caracterizando inÃcio de processo de reabsorÃÃo. Contrariamente, a concentraÃÃo de solutos solÃveis foi decrescente apÃs 7 : 30 h, mantendo valores semelhantes (p> 0, 01) durante todo o perÃodo da manhÃ e superiores aos da tarde, coincidindo com o pico de atividade das abelhas. Apesar do padrÃo de secreÃÃo do nÃctar demonstrar maiores valores de volume e quantidade de aÃÃcar no perÃodo da tarde, nas condiÃÃes naturais de visitaÃÃo da Ãrea de estudo praticamente todo o nÃctar foi coletado ainda pela manhÃ, em funÃÃo da elevada atividade de visitantes influenciada pelas condiÃÃes de temperatura. Todos os visitantes florais amostrados, com exceÃÃo de Megachile sp., possuem caracterÃsticas de tamanho da glossa que condizem com a estrutura morfolÃgica das flores, proporcionando sucesso na coleta do nÃctar e, potencialmente, no processo de polinizaÃÃo da castanheira. A Ãrea com capoeira manteve uma populaÃÃo mais rica e abundante do que a sem capoeira (p 0, 05), tanto no ambiente com capoeira quanto no sem a capoeira, apesar de ter sido verificado populaÃÃes mais diversas nesse ambiente. Dessa forma, conclui-se que parece haver um sincronismo entre o padrÃo de secreÃÃo de nÃctar e a atividade dos visitantes florais e potenciais polinizadores, aumentando as chances de sucesso reprodutivo pelas interaÃÃes abelha-planta. Conclui-se ainda que o sistema de manejo da paisagem que mantÃm faixas de vegetaÃÃo secundÃria âcapoeiraâ no interior do plantio mantÃm uma maior riqueza e abundÃncia de abelhas polinizadoras, favorecendo assim a polinizaÃÃo e o incremento da produtividade da cultura...|$|E
40|$|It is {{possible}} that many abnormal conceptuses are lost {{at an early stage}} without the mother's knowledge. To investigate this further the reproductive history of the mothers of defective embryos (neural tube defects, holoprosencephaly, cleft lip, polydactyly, and <b>early</b> embryonic <b>resorption)</b> was compared with that of the mothers of normal embryos. The frequency of prior miscarriages was higher in the case mothers than in normal controls matched for maternal age and gravidity, the difference being significant for all the anomalies except for polydactyly. The case mothers had fewer prior recognised pregnancies than control mothers matched for maternal age. There were more primigravid mothers in abnormal groups, and the difference from controls was significant for neural tube defects. It was assumed that the gravidity of the case mothers may be underestimated, possibly due to increased early abortions which are not recognised clinically. Thus, it seems that both recognised and unrecognised abortions occur more often in the mothers of defective embryos. Since many spontaneous abortuses are morphologically and/or cytogenetically abnormal, some women appear to conceive abnormal embryos repeatedly. Most of these embryos, however, may be screened out prenatally and escape clinical detection. Information on prior reproductive history of the woman should be examined carefully in genetic counselling...|$|R
40|$|To date, mesenchymal {{cells have}} only been {{associated}} with bone resorption indirectly, {{and it has been}} hypothesized that the degradation of bone is associated exclusively with specific functions of osteoclasts. Here we show, in aseptic prosthesis loosening, that aggressive fibroblasts at the bone surface actively contribute to bone resorption and that this is independent of osteoclasts. In two separate models (a severe combined immunodeficient mouse coimplantation model and a dentin pit formation assay), these cells produce signs of bone resorption that are similar to those in <b>early</b> osteoclastic <b>resorption.</b> In an animal model of aseptic prosthesis loosening (i. e. intracranially self-stimulated rats), it is shown that these fibroblasts acquire their ability to degrade bone early on in their differentiation. Upon stimulation, such fibroblasts readily release acidic components that lower the pH of their pericellular milieu. Through the use of specific inhibitors, pericellular acidification is shown to involve the action of vacuolar type ATPases. Although fibroblasts, as mesenchymal derived cells, are thought to be incapable of resorbing bone, the present study provides the first evidence to challenge this widely held belief. It is demonstrated that fibroblast-like cells, under pathological conditions, may not only enhance but also actively contribute to bone resorption. These cells should therefore be considered novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of bone destructive disorders...|$|R
40|$|Deciduous teeth exfoliate as {{a result}} of {{apoptosis}} induced by cementoblasts, a process that reveals the mineralized portion of the root while attracting clasts. Root resorption in deciduous teeth is slow due to lack of mediators necessary to speed it up; however, it accelerates and spreads in one single direction whenever a permanent tooth pericoronal follicle, rich in epithelial growth factor (EGF), or other bone resorption mediators come near. The latter are responsible for bone resorption during eruption, and deciduous teeth root resorption and exfoliation. Should deciduous teeth be subjected to orthodontic movement or anchorage, mediators local levels will increase. Thus, one should be fully aware that root resorption in deciduous teeth will speed up and exfoliation will early occur. Treatment planning involving deciduous teeth orthodontic movement and/or anchorage should consider: Are clinical benefits relevant enough as to be worth the risk of undergoing <b>early</b> inconvenient root <b>resorption...</b>|$|R
40|$|Familial bone {{dysplasia}} with hyperphosphatasemia {{is characterized}} by excessive bone <b>resorption</b> <b>early</b> in life with resulting severe skeletal deformity. The disease can be ameliorated by treatment with human calcitonin. We have the studied the ultrastructure of bone from diseased patients before treatment and at intervals during 1 year of treatment with calcitonin. Pretreatment osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes exhibited mitochondria which contained vast amounts of dense microcrystal deposits. Osteocytes were also distinguished by minimal organellar development. Osteoclasts were rare. Calcitonin treatment included a progressive development of a more normal bone structure. Intramitochondrial crystal deposits were absent in mitochondria of osteocytes and osteoclasts but were still present in mitochondria of osteoblasts. Surprisingly, the developing bony matrix during calcitonin treatment exhibited large numbers of elastic fibers. These appeared to develop normally in alignment with the surface membrane of osteocytes. Calcitonin treatment caused a proliferation of osteocyte organellar development. It is concluded that familial bone dysplasia is primarily a disease of osteocytes and that osteocytic activity is influenced by calcitonin...|$|R

Based on the developmental {{events and the}} energy the reby utilized, the early life history of this species {{can be broken down}} into the following five phases: 1) rapid early growth due to rapid yolk resorption (from hatching to about 15 hr after hatching (TAH); 2) morphological differentiation and slowgrowth based on energy from yolk (to about 50 h TAH when the yolk is exhausted); 3) slow growth with initiation of feeding and swimming activities, based on energy from oil globule and from exogenous food (to about 110 h TAH); 4) accelerated growth and effective feeding and swimming based on the same two sources of energy as in the preceding stage (up to about 120 - 140 h TAH when the oil globule is exhausted); and 5) accelerated growth, effective feeding and swimming and further development based solely on exogenous energy (beyond 140 h TAIT) ...|$|R
40|$|Deciduous teeth {{contrary}} to permanent ones have relatively short lifetime and functional duration; they are formed {{in a much}} shorter period of time, and are subordinated to an <b>early</b> physiological <b>resorption</b> of the roots, {{in order to make}} free space for lining of the permanent teeth. Dental pulp is a unique tissue, which is responsible for maintaining of the tooth vitality. In order to examine the reparatory pulp ability of deciduous teeth we investigated histological changes of the nerve fibers in the pulp. Histological findings were performed on a light microscope and on a Transmission Electron Microscope. Nerve fibers in deciduous dental pulp showed some disturbances when physiological resorption had been started. Under light microscopy, nerve fibers showed unclear pathological changes – they begain to loose the myelin coat because of increased edema. Using TEM, non-myelin nerve fibers showed disorder in the homogeneousness of the axoplasmal structure, less density of mucopolysaccharide matrix in some places, which suggested edematous vacuolar changes and probably under its pressure an atrophy of the axons occurred gradually. The myelin nerve fibers showed deformations and division of the myelin coat; type lamellar osmiophillic bodies in shape of sphinx’s myelin figures, with irregular thickness, developed from formation of vacuoles, filled with shapeless and low granulated material. The Schwann´s cells were degenerated, with relatively preserved nucleus, {{contrary to}} the cytoplasm where collagen fibers are inserted directly and the increased collagenisation became apparent endoneurally. The myelin nerve fibers are plased longitudinally, their diameters is enlarged; they has interlamellar fissures, and they atrophy with resorption progress.

40|$|Occupational health {{standards}} {{have not been}} established for sulfur mustard (HD) [bis{ 2 -chloroethyl) -sulfide) &#x 27; a strong alkylating agent with known mutagenic properties. Little, however, {{is known about the}} mutagenic activity of HD in mammalian species and data regarding the dominant lethal effects of HD are ambiguous. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the dominant lethal effect in male and female rats orally exposed to HD. The study was conducted in two phases; a female dominant lethal phase and a male dominant lethal phase. Sprague-Dawley rats of each sex were administered 0. 08, 0. 20, or 0. 50 mg/kg HD in sesame oil 5 days/week for 10 weeks. For the female phase, treated or untreated males were mated with treated females and their fetuses were evaluated at approximately 14 days after copulation. For the male dominant lethal phase, treated males cohabited with untreated femal (during 5 days of each week for 10 weeks) and females were sacrificed for fetal evaluation 14 days after the midweek of cohabitation during each of the 10 weeks. The appearance and behavior of the rats were unremarkable throughout the experiment and there were no treatment-related deaths. Growth rates were reduced in both female and male rats treated with 0. 50 mg/kg HD. Indicators of reproductive performance did not demonstrate significant female dominant lethal effects, although significant male dominant lethal effects were observed at 2 and 3 week post-exposure. These effects included increases of <b>early</b> fetal <b>resorptions</b> and preimplantation losses and decreases of total live embryo implants. These effects were most consistently observed at a dose of 0. 50 mg/kg, but frequently occurred at the lower doses. Although no treatment-related effects on male reproductive organ weights or sperm motility were found, a significant increase in the percentage of abnormal sperm was detected in males exposed to 0. 50 mg/kg HD. The timing of these effects is consistent with an effect during the postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis, possibly involving the generally sensitive spermatids...|$|R
40|$|Radiation-induced {{bone loss}} can occur with {{radiotherapy}} patients, accidental radiation exposure and during long-term spaceflight. Bone loss due to radiation {{is due to}} an early increase in oxidative stress, inflammation and bone resorption, resulting in an imbalance in bone remodeling. Furthermore, exposure to high-Linear Energy Transfer (LET) radiation will impair the bone forming progenitors and reduce bone formation. Radiation can be classified as high-LET or low-LET based {{on the amount of}} energy released. Dried Plum (DP) diet prevents bone loss in mice exposed to total body irradiation with both low-LET and high-LET radiation. DP prevents the <b>early</b> radiation-induced bone <b>resorption,</b> but furthermore, we show that DP protects the bone forming osteoblast progenitors from high-LET radiation. These results provide insight that DP re-balances the bone remodeling by preventing resorption and protecting the bone formation capacity. This data is important considering that most of the current osteoporosis treatments only block the bone resorption but do not protect bone formation. In addition, DP seems to act on both the oxidative stress and inflammation pathways. Finally, we have preliminary data showing the potential of DP to be radio-protective at a systemic effect and could possible protect other tissues at risk of total body-irradiation such as skin, brain and heart...|$|R
