60|$|Will Brangwen <b>ducked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{and looked}} at his uncle with swift, mistrustful eyes, like a caged hawk.|$|E
60|$|Just {{then another}} overripe tomato came {{whizzing}} over the rowboat. Had not Whopper <b>ducked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{he must have}} been struck.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sthop! Ton't hit me!" [...] yelled poor Hans, {{and badly}} frightened he <b>ducked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{although}} the flying machine was fully twenty-five feet above him.|$|E
60|$|The youngster made {{a hideous}} grimace, and then scurried away, <b>ducking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> lest {{in spite of}} Myles's {{well-known}} good-nature the block should come whizzing after him.|$|R
60|$|With a leer at {{the captain}} the cook complied. He then doubled <b>his</b> fists, and, <b>ducking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> scientifically, danced all round the stupefied {{master of the}} Frolic.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Heard gave a surly grunt, {{and after}} testing the {{temperature}} of the water with his hand, slowly and reluctantly immersed one foot. Then, with sudden resolution, he waded in and, <b>ducking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> stood up gasping.|$|R
60|$|Paul {{heard the}} advice, {{and he turned}} his back to the audience. Ben, seeing that his {{suggestion}} had been carried out, <b>ducked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> again, very much to Hamlet's perplexity.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is Mr. and Mrs. Robin Redbreast, one of {{our most}} aristocratic families," [...] said he, {{swinging}} his club around in a circle until Chubbins <b>ducked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> for fear it might hit him.|$|E
6000|$|The {{report of}} a musket {{interrupted}} his train of gloomy thoughts, and involuntarily he <b>ducked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> when a bullet came singing over the fence so near that he felt the [...] "wind" [...] of it.|$|E
60|$|He pushed some o' {{the things}} {{into a corner}} and then 'e spat on 'is 'ands, and began to prance up and down, and <b>duck</b> <b>'is</b> <b>'ead</b> about and hit the air {{in a way that}} {{surprised}} 'em.|$|R
60|$|He pushed some o’ {{the things}} {{into a corner}} and then ’e spat on ’is ’ands, and began to prance up and down, and <b>duck</b> <b>’is</b> <b>’ead</b> about and hit the air {{in a way that}} {{surprised}} ’em.|$|R
60|$|All fled in {{different}} directions, except Sambo, who, presuming on the favor which the keeper had {{to him as}} a licensed wag, stood <b>his</b> ground, <b>ducking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> with a facetious grin, whenever the master made a dive at him.|$|R
60|$|Etienne began {{it after}} supper. Miss Adams had {{suddenly}} displayed a lively {{interest in the}} kitchen layout and I could see her in there, chatting brightly at George--not with him--the while he <b>ducked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and rattled his pans.|$|E
60|$|And so saying, {{he threw}} pot and broth {{and all at}} Claus, so that if he hadn't <b>ducked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{he might have been}} scalded to death. Then Claus ran out into the street, for he saw that there was no place for him to stay in that house.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a word," [...] the Squire said, and {{his wife}} did not trouble herself to protest; Reverdy opened his mouth in a soundless laugh at the Squire's humor, and then filled it with bacon and corn-pone, and <b>ducked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in silence over his plate. [...] "What goings on?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it's {{the edge}} is her saving grace." [...] Dick replied, <b>ducking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to a volley of sleet that drove {{around a corner}} of the canvas. [...] "The edge that you and I've got, Tommy, and the edge of our mothers before us." ...|$|R
60|$|Old Granny Fox {{started to}} say {{something}} unpleasant. Then she changed her mind and instead she sat down and told Bobby Coon all her troubles. As she talked, Bobby Coon kept <b>ducking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> behind a branch of the tree to hide a smile. Finally Granny Fox noticed it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{you home}} again, my boy!" [...] she said tenderly to the horse, {{not to the}} man. The great beast shifted round to her, <b>ducking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> She smuggled into his mouth the {{wrinkled}} yellow apple she had been hiding behind her back, then she kissed him near the eyes. He gave a big sigh of pleasure. She held <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in her arms against her breast.|$|R
60|$|Herluin had <b>ducked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{behind the}} parapet; not from cowardice, but {{simply because he}} had on no mail, and might be shot any moment. But when he heard Winter forbid them to touch him, he lifted up his head, and gave his old pupil {{as good as he}} brought.|$|E
60|$|The {{blacksmith}} concluded {{by knocking}} La Roche's pipe {{out of his}} mouth, in the excess of his glee at the prospective feast; after which he begged his pardon solemnly in bad French, and <b>ducked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to avoid the tin can that was hurled at it by the indignant Frenchman.|$|E
60|$|And, having {{delivered}} these admirable hints {{to young}} cashiers {{in a hurry}} to get rich, Mr. Jarvis <b>ducked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in a species of bow, declined to be thanked, and shuffled out into the street, leaving Betty to open her new career by taking thirty-seven cents from the late breakfaster.|$|E
60|$|So Chubbins tried it, {{and found}} he could balance his little body on one leg very nicely. For if he toppled either way he had but to spread his wings and tail {{feathers}} and so keep himself from falling. He picked up his hat with the claws of his other foot and managed {{to put it on}} by <b>ducking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Save us {{from this}} folly," [...] he persisted, <b>ducking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> about to avoid their sweet-filled palms. [...] "We must have dignity, understand, dignity. This will ruin us. They are making tame animals of us, playthings. When they grow tired of us they will throw us out. You're {{doing the right}} thing. Stick to it. Stand them off. Command respect, respect for all of us--" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{shook her}} off and sprang to one side, but only {{just in time}} to avoid a {{crashing}} blow from a great club {{in the hands of a}} man even taller and stronger than himself. He had one quick vision of great white teeth clenched in grim ferocity, a wild flying beard and blazing wild-beast eyes. The next instant he had closed, <b>ducking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> beneath another swing of that murderous cudgel.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you think}} that is the best plan I'll follow your advice, and never so much as wince in the doing of it, for you was one who would have left us to starve," [...] Nathan said so {{promptly}} that the man involuntarily <b>ducked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> as if fearing a bullet might follow the words.|$|E
60|$|The Pyrenees shipped two {{heavy seas}} {{as she was}} swung off and put once more before it, and the first mate {{expressed}} a desire to have all that water down in the hold, if only it could be introduced without taking off the hatches. McCoy <b>ducked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> into the binnacle and watched the course set.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{house is}} open day an' night,' she sez, wid a laugh; an' Love- o'-Women <b>ducked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> an' hild {{up his hand}} as tho' he was gyardin'. The Power was on him still - it hild him up still, for, by my sowl, as I'll never save ut, he walked up the {{verandah}} steps {{that had been a}} livin' corpse in hospital for a month! ...|$|E
60|$|During the {{geography}} lesson, {{as she was}} pointing to the map with her cane, the boy continually <b>ducked</b> <b>his</b> whitish <b>head</b> under the desk, and {{attracted the attention of}} other boys.|$|R
6000|$|... [MRS. ROBERTS {{goes and}} speak timidly to THE PORTER, who fails {{at first to}} understand, then smiles broadly, accepts a quarter with a <b>duck</b> of <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and comes forward to AUNT MARY'S side.] ...|$|R
60|$|And Hannibal, snarling, growling, and spitting, <b>ducking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{and with}} short paw-strokes trying {{to ward off}} the insistent broomstick, backed obediently into the corner, {{crumpled}} up his hind-parts, and tried to withdraw his corporeal body within itself in a pain-urged effort to make it smaller. And always he kept his nose down and himself harmless for a spring. In the thick of it he slowly raised his nose and yawned. Nor, because it came up slowly, and because Collins had anticipated the yawn by being one thought ahead of Hannibal in Hannibal's own brain, was the nose rapped.|$|R
6000|$|He shivered slightly, and <b>ducked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{under the}} cover again. But the {{brightness}} of the sun and some exhilarating quality in the air tempted him to have another outlook, avoiding as far as possible the grimly decorated walls. If they had only left him his faithful servant he could have relieved himself of that mischievous badinage which always alternately horrified and delighted that devoted negro. But he was alone--absolutely alone--in this conventicle! ...|$|E
60|$|Captain Sellers paid no heed. Still {{performing}} marvellous {{things with}} his feet, he <b>ducked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> over one shoulder, feinted {{with his left}} at Mr. Truefitt’s face, and struck with his right somewhere near the centre of his opponent’s waistcoat. Mr. Truefitt, still gazing at him open-mouthed, retreated backward, and, just as the captain’s parchment-like fist struck him a second time, tripped over a water-can {{that had been left}} in the path and fell heavily on his back in a flower-bed.|$|E
60|$|While Gascoyne {{was reading}} the letter to which we have referred, Keona {{suddenly}} placed his left leg behind surly Dick, and, with his unwounded fist, hit that morose individual such a tremendous back-handed blow on the nose, that he instantly measured his length on the ground. John Bumpus made a sudden plunge at the savage on seeing this, but the latter <b>ducked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> passed like an eel under the very arms of the sailor, and went off into the forest like a deer.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Butler, meanwhile, having doffed his bath-robe, {{stretched}} himself, {{and with}} leisurely nonchalance {{put on a}} second pair of gloves, was filling in the time with a little shadow boxing. He moved rhythmically to and fro, now <b>ducking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> now striking out with his muffled hands, and a sickening realization of the man's animal power swept over Sally and turned her cold. Swathed in his bath-robe, Bugs Butler had conveyed an atmosphere of dangerousness: in the boxing-tights which showed up every rippling muscle, he was horrible and sinister, a machine built for destruction, a human panther.|$|R
60|$|Without asking farther questions, {{the landlady}} filled Dick Ostler a bumper of Hollands. He <b>ducked</b> with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and shoulders, scraped with his more {{advanced}} hoof, bolted the alcohol, {{to use the}} learned phrase, and withdrew to his own domains.|$|R
6000|$|The old {{man called}} out, [...] "Here, Abel!" [...] {{and the figure}} of what seemed an elderly boy came lurching and {{paddling}} round {{the corner of the}} cabin, and <b>ducked</b> <b>his</b> gray <b>head</b> hospitably toward the stranger. [...] "Give this horse a feed while we're taking ours." ...|$|R
