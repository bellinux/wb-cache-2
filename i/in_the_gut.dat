5|$|A single fungal serpin {{has been}} {{characterized}} to date: celpin from Piromyces spp. strain E2. Piromyces is a genus of anaerobic fungi found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> of ruminants and is important for digesting plant material. Celpin is predicted to be inhibitory and contains two N-terminal dockerin domains {{in addition to its}} serpin domain. Dockerins are commonly found in proteins that localise to the fungal cellulosome, a large extracellular multiprotein complex that breaks down cellulose. It is therefore suggested that celpin may protect the cellulosome against plant proteases. Certain bacterial serpins similarly localize to the cellulosome.|$|E

5|$|BZP also {{acts as a}} non-selective {{serotonin}} {{receptor agonist}} {{on a wide variety}} of serotonin receptors; binding to 5HT2A receptors may explain its mild hallucinogenic effects at high doses, while partial agonist or antagonist effects at the 5HT2B receptors may explain some of BZPs peripheral side effects, as this receptor is expressed very densely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gut,</b> and binding to 5HT3 receptors may explain the common side effect of headaches, as this receptor is known to be involved in the development of migraine headaches.|$|E
5|$|MFGM may {{be capable}} of {{modulating}} immune function <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> through distinct but potentially complementary mechanisms. Glycosylated proteins (MUC-1, MUC-15, butyrophilin, and lactadherin) and glycosylated sphingolipids from MFGM may promote the development of healthy gut microbiota by favoring beneficial Bifidobacterium species. Another key to the immunomodulatory function of MFGM may be that its structure {{is similar to that}} of the intestinal cell membrane, allowing human milk glycans (including those on glycoproteins and glycolipids) to competitively inhibit the binding of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, even toxins) to host cells.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The diet of Engraulicypris sardella (Cyprinidae) larvae was {{determined}} {{from the open}} waters of Lake Malawi, Africa. <b>The</b> <b>guts</b> of first-feeding larvae of 2 - 3 mm total length (TL) usually contained many cells of 5 - 9 um diameter tentatively identified as a non-colonial green alga (Chloro-phyta). The number of these cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> of larvae declined as larvae increased in size, and were not found in larvae greater than 9 mm TL. Other types of phytoplankton were rarely seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> of larvae. Copepod nauplii were eaten by larvae greater than 4 mm TL, and copepodite copepods and cladoceans by larvae greater than 5 mm TL. The biomass of open water crustacean zooplankton and E. sardella larvae were determined over a 2 -year sampling programme. The mortality rate of E. sardella was negatively correlated with zooplankton biomass, but was not significantly correlated {{with the amount of}} zooplankton food <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> of larvae...|$|R
5|$|The {{largest number}} exist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> flora, {{and a large}} number on the skin. The vast {{majority}} of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the immune system, though many are beneficial particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> flora. However several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy, and bubonic plague. The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections, with tuberculosis alone killing about 2 million people per year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. In developed countries, antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in farming, making antibiotic resistance a growing problem. In industry, bacteria are important in sewage treatment and the breakdown of oil spills, the production of cheese and yogurt through fermentation, and the recovery of gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the mining sector, as well as in biotechnology, and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals.|$|E
5|$|VP4 is on {{the surface}} of the virion that {{protrudes}} as a spike. It binds to molecules {{on the surface of}} cells called receptors and drives the entry of the virus into the cell. VP4 has to be modified by the protease enzyme trypsin, which is found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gut,</b> into VP5* and VP8* before the virus is infectious. VP4 determines how virulent the virus is and it determines the P-type of the virus.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} function of enzymes {{is in the}} digestive systems of animals. Enzymes such as amylases and proteases break down large molecules (starch or proteins, respectively) into smaller ones, {{so they can be}} absorbed by the intestines. Starch molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as maltose and eventually glucose, which can then be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food substances. In ruminants, which have herbivorous diets, microorganisms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> produce another enzyme, cellulase, to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.|$|E

5|$|Archaea {{can also}} be commensals, benefiting from an {{association}} without helping or harming the other organism. For example, the methanogen Methanobrevibacter smithii {{is by far the}} most common archaean in the human flora, making up about one in ten of all the prokaryotes in the human gut. In termites and in humans, these methanogens may in fact be mutualists, interacting with other microbes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> to aid digestion. Archaean communities also associate with a range of other organisms, such as on the surface of corals, and in the region of soil that surrounds plant roots (the rhizosphere).|$|E
5|$|Copper is an {{essential}} trace element in plants and animals, but not all microorganisms. The human body contains copper {{at a level of}} about 1.4 to 2.1mg per kg of body mass. Copper is absorbed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gut,</b> then transported to the liver bound to albumin. After processing in the liver, copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase, which involves the protein ceruloplasmin, carrying the majority of copper in blood. Ceruloplasmin also carries the copper that is excreted in milk, and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper source. Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation (about 5mg a day, vs. about 1mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via bile, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.|$|E
5|$|Other {{antioxidants}} are not {{obtained from}} the diet, but instead {{are made in the}} body. For example, ubiquinol (coenzyme Q) is poorly absorbed from the gut and is made through the mevalonate pathway. Another example is glutathione, which is made from amino acids. As any glutathione <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> is broken down to free cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid before being absorbed, even large oral intake has little effect on the concentration of glutathione in the body. Although large amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids such as acetylcysteine can increase glutathione, no evidence exists that eating high levels of these glutathione precursors is beneficial for healthy adults.|$|E
40|$|Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) {{nanoparticles}} {{are widely}} used in water treatments, yet their influences on other contaminants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water are not well studied. <b>In</b> this study, <b>the</b> aqueous uptake, assimilation efficiency, and toxicity of two ionic metals (cadmium-Cd, and zinc-Zn) in a freshwater zooplankton, Daphnia magna, were investigated following 2 days pre-exposure to nano-TiO 2. Pre-exposure to 1 mg/L nano-TiO 2 resulted in {{a significant increase in}} Cd and Zn uptake from the dissolved phase. After <b>the</b> nano-TiO 2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> were cleared, <b>the</b> uptake rates immediately recovered to the normal levels. Concurrent measurements of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and metallothioneins (MTs) suggested that the increased metal uptake was mainly due to the increased number of binding sites provided by nano-TiO 2 presented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts.</b> Consistently, pre-exposure to nano-TiO 2 increased the toxicity of aqueous Cd and Zn due to enhanced uptake. Our study provides the evidence that nano-TiO 2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> of animals could increase the uptake and toxicity of other contaminants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|Procellariids are {{vulnerable}} to other threats as well. Ingestion of plastic flotsam {{is a problem for}} the family as it is for many other seabirds. Once swallowed, this plastic can cause a general decline in the fitness of the bird, or in some cases lodge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> and cause a blockage, leading to death by starvation. Procellariids are also vulnerable to general marine pollution, as well as oil spills. Some species, such as the Barau's petrel, the Newell's shearwater or the Cory's shearwater, which nest high up on large developed islands are victims of light pollution. Chicks that are fledging are attracted to streetlights and are unable to reach the sea. An estimated 20–40% of fledging Barau's petrels are attracted to the streetlights on Réunion.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, Albert Sabin {{developed}} another live, oral polio vaccine. It {{was produced}} by the repeated passage of the virus through nonhuman cells at subphysiological temperatures. The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine replicates very efficiently <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gut,</b> the primary site of wild poliovirus infection and replication, but the vaccine strain is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue. A single dose of Sabin's oral polio vaccine produces immunity to all three poliovirus serotypes in about 50 percent of recipients. Three doses of live-attenuated oral vaccine produce protective antibody to all three poliovirus types in more than 95 percent of recipients. Human trials of Sabin's vaccine began in 1957, and in 1958 it was selected, in competition with the live vaccines of Koprowski and other researchers, by the US National Institutes of Health. Licensed in 1962, it rapidly became the only polio vaccine used worldwide.|$|E
5|$|There are 57 {{nucleotide}} substitutions which {{distinguish the}} attenuated Sabin 1 strain from its virulent parent (the Mahoney serotype), two nucleotide substitutions attenuate the Sabin 2 strain, and 10 substitutions {{are involved in}} attenuating the Sabin 3 strain. The primary attenuating factor common to all three Sabin vaccines is a mutation located in the virus's internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which alters stem-loop structures, and reduces the ability of poliovirus to translate its RNA template within the host cell. The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine replicates very efficiently <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gut,</b> the primary site of infection and replication, but is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue.|$|E
