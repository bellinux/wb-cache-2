5000|$|Selection of {{the right}} weld joint depends on the {{thickness}} and process used. The square welds are the most economical for pieces thinner than 3/8”, because they don’t require the edge to be prepared. [...] Double-groove welds are the most economical for thicker pieces because they require less weld material and time. The use of fusion welding is common for closed single-bevel, closed single J, open single J, and closed double J butt joints. The use of gas and arc welding is ideal for <b>double-bevel,</b> closed <b>double-bevel,</b> open <b>double-bevel,</b> single-bevel, and open single-bevel butt welds.|$|E

40|$|Incomplete {{penetration}} in <b>double-bevel</b> welds, double-V welds, and T joints can {{be detected}} and its size estimated only with the tandem technique. Sometimes, however, the tandem technique cannot be readily used because of a complex specimen shape, particularly at sheets with wide surfacing welds and closed vessels. The estimation of a reflector size using the DGS method provides no useful results. A multi-wave ultrasonic probe and transformation of ultrasonic waves, however, may substitute for the tandem technique. Keywords: Multi-wave ultrasonic probe, Tandem technique 1. Testing of thin-walled welds: d = 6 - 25 mm A plate of only 12 mm in thickness, a surfacing weld of 12 mm in width and the access to one surface only did not permit to use the tandem technique. The sole option was testing with a MWB 70 probe of 4 MHz and the estimation of the reflector size using DGS. According to the DGS method the reflector size was 3 mm, which means around 7 mm 2 of the reflecting surface. The reflector length being around 10 mm, which exceeds the sound-beam width, {{this means that the}} height of the incomplete penetration was 0. 7 mm only. Such small discontinuities can b...|$|E
