5|$|While Shakespeare's {{daffodil}} is {{the wild}} or true English daffodil (N. pseudonarcissus), many other species were introduced, {{some of which}} escaped and naturalised, particularly N. biflorus (a hybrid) in Devon and the west of England. Gerard, in his extensive discussion of daffodils, both wild and cultivated ("bastard daffodils") described twenty four species in London gardens (1597), ("we <b>have</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> {{and every one of}} them in our London gardens, in great abundance", p.114).|$|E
25|$|The Scots {{went into}} this tournament as favourites, being holders of the Intercontinental Cup and the ICC Trophy. However, rain in Utrecht {{prevented}} them from a good start against the Dutch, who bowled well enough to <b>have</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> out for 217 on the first day. Ian Stanger hit his second first-class fifty and Ryan Watson 46, but South African-born Ryan ten Doeschate took three important, albeit expensive, wickets and medium-pacer Edgar Schiferli finished with four for 46. In reply, Maurits van Nierop lashed out, taking 24 off the Scottish bowlers as the Dutch made 31 for 0 to see them to stumps on day 1. Play was impossible on the next two days, and the Scots now needed to thump Ireland in Aberdeen {{if they were to}} have any hope of qualifying for the semi-finals.|$|E
25|$|While {{the first}} game was in 2D, the second game {{features}} 3D graphics; this change affected the puzzle creation, as the development team could choose to layer objects behind each other or <b>have</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> visible at once. As the second game was made with a worldwide release in mind, Japanese characters and references to Japanese culture were avoided in the puzzle design; the puzzles ended up using numbers a lot since they are internationally used symbols. For the iOS version of {{the first game}}, the puzzles were removed and replaced with new story sequences; this was done as the development team wanted to reach {{people who are not}} good at solving puzzles, or who do not play games at all and who might not have a game console. However, according to Uchikoshi, the development staff felt that the game was incomplete without the puzzle sequences of the original version.|$|E

500|$|In {{the opening}} verse, Harrison lists {{a variety of}} {{chocolate}} flavours and employs wordplay to incorporate the Mackintosh brand name in his closing phrase, [...] "yes, you know it's 'good news". The refrain throughout the song, [...] "But you'll have to <b>have</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> pulled out after the savoy truffle", refers to the deterioration of one's teeth after eating too many sweets, echoing the warning that Clapton had recently received from his dentist.|$|E
500|$|Director Brad Bird {{stated in}} 2007 {{that he was}} open {{to the idea of}} a sequel if he could come up with an idea {{superior}} to the original film: [...] "I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't <b>have</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> together." [...] During an interview in May 2013, Bird reiterated his interest in making a sequel. [...] "I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have. Because I love those characters and love that world," [...] said Bird. [...] "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head. I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another Incredibles film, and if I can get ‘em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that." ...|$|E
500|$|Kreisberg {{described}} the crossover between both shows as [...] "a superhero a-go-go!", saying: [...] "It’s insane to <b>have</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> together." [...] Unlike the 2014 crossover, which was two separate self-contained adventures that involved each show, Marc Guggenheim, executive producer on Arrow, said: [...] "This [...] is a crazy, full-on 'To Be Continued' crossover,... it really {{feels like a}} 2-hour movie [...] over two nights." [...] Kreisberg and Guggenheim also reassured fans that both episodes would not focus solely on setting up the spin-off series, and that the crossover is still Oliver Queen and Barry Allen having their own adventure. [...] "These [...] have important stuff going on for the narratives of both The Flash and Arrow," [...] said Kriesberg, while Guggenheim added: [...] "The final moments of The Flash have a pretty big jaw-dropper and we pick up those threads in Arrow. Then we do some things with the characters from Arrow... that are pretty epic and major." ...|$|E

500|$|As the bell-making nears completion, Boriska’s {{confidence}} slowly transforms into a stunned, detached disbelief that he’s succeeded at the task. The work crew {{takes over}} as Boriska makes several attempts to {{fade into the}} background of the activity. Once the bell has been hoisted into its tower the Grand Prince and his entourage arrive for the inaugural ceremony as the bell is blessed by the priests. As the bell is prepared to be rung the royal entourage is overhead discussing their doubts that it will. It is revealed that Boriska and the work crew know if the bell fails to ring the Grand Prince will <b>have</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> beheaded. (It is also overheard that the Grand Prince had his brother, who raided Vladimir in The Raid sequence, beheaded.) There is a quiet, agonizing tension as the foreman slowly coaxes the bell's clapper back and forth, nudging it closer to the lip of the bell with each swing. A pan across the assembly reveals white-robed Durochka, leading a horse (preceded by a child, presumably hers) as she walks through the crowd. At the critical moment the bell rings perfectly, and she smiles. After the ceremony, Andrei finds Boriska collapsed on the ground, sobbing. [...] He admits his father never told him the secret of casting a bell. Andrei comforts him, breaking his vow of silence and telling the boy that they should carry on their work together: “You’ll cast bells. I’ll paint icons.” Andrei sees Durochka, the boy, and the horse walk off across a muddy field in the distance.|$|E

2500|$|All {{of these}} songs have failed to chart, Game decided to <b>have</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> removed from the album and chose instead to release them on various mixtapes, {{including}} The Red Room and Brake Lights mixtapes. Although the song [...] "Bottles & Rockin' J's" [...] featuring DJ Khaled, Fabolous, Lil Wayne, Busta Rhymes and Rick Ross, produced by Lex Luger, was being considered as the album's second official single, It was later confirmed to be the album's sixth street single. It would later {{be included in the}} deluxe edition of Khaled's fifth album We the Best Forever and on Game's 2012 mixtape California Republic.|$|E

2500|$|During the war, many non-white refugees, {{including}} Malays, Indonesians and Filipinos, {{arrived in}} Australia, but Calwell controversially sought to <b>have</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> deported. In 1948, Iranian Bahá'ís seeking to immigrate to Australia {{were classified as}} [...] "Asiatic" [...] by the policy and were denied entry. In 1949, Calwell's successor Harold Holt allowed the remaining 800 non-white refugees to apply for residency, and also allowed Japanese [...] "war brides" [...] to settle in Australia. In the meantime, encouraging immigration from Europe, Australia admitted large numbers of immigrants from mostly Italy, Greece and Yugoslavia, {{as well as its}} traditional source of the British Isles. Ambitious post-war development projects like the Snowy Mountains Scheme (1949–1972) required a large labour force that could only be sourced by diversifying Australia's migrant intake.|$|E
