500|$|A sturdy thin-legged antelope, the nilgai is characterised by {{a sloping}} back, a deep {{neck with a}} white patch on the throat, a short mane of <b>hair</b> <b>behind</b> and along the back ending behind the shoulder, and around two white spots each on its face, ears, cheeks, lips and chin. The ears, tipped with black, are [...] long. A column of coarse hair, known as the [...] "pendant" [...] and around [...] long in males, can be {{observed}} along the dewlap ridge below the white throat patch. The tufted tail, [...] up to , has a few white spots and is tipped with black. The forelegs are generally longer, and the legs are often marked with white [...] "socks".|$|E
2500|$|The {{banknote}} series {{became known as}} the [...] "Devil's Head" [...] series, because the <b>hair</b> <b>behind</b> the Queen's head looked somewhat like a grinning demon. [...] This led to design modifications for all denominations. The second variant of the series was issued in 1956.|$|E
60|$|Sadly she twined in sauntering gold <b>hair</b> <b>behind</b> a curving ear.|$|E
50|$|This rhizomatous {{perennial}} grass has stems {{which can}} exceed two meters in height. The leaf blades {{are up to}} 52 centimeters long and may be hairless to hairy, with a dense coating of <b>hairs</b> <b>behind</b> the ligules. The inflorescence is a panicle with up to 6 branches. The paired spikelets are generally oval in shape and measure a few millimeters long.|$|R
50|$|Lambik is a middle-aged, fairly fat {{man who is}} bald, {{except for}} three small <b>hairs</b> <b>behind</b> each of his ears. He often wears a white shirt, a black bow tie and black pants. He is an anti hero. He is a dumb, clumsy, vain, arrogant, absent-minded, aggressive, {{stubborn}} and dominant character, but with {{a heart of gold}} and provides comic relief in the series.|$|R
5000|$|Triangular {{alopecia}} (also {{known as}} [...] "Temporal alopecia" [...] and [...] "Temporal triangular alopecia") (TTA) is hair loss {{that may be}} congenital but usually appears in childhood as a focal patch of loss that may be complete or leaving fine vellus <b>hairs</b> <b>behind.</b> Affected individuals are typically entirely healthy. Hair restoration surgery using follicular unit transplantation has been a successful treatment modality for TTA ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose <b>hair</b> <b>behind</b> an ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, {{she twisted}} twined a hair.|$|E
60|$|Shall I part my <b>hair</b> <b>behind?</b> Do I dare {{to eat a}} peach? I shall wear white flannel trousers, {{and walk}} upon the beach. I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.|$|E
6000|$|... "I take it he's plumb crazy," [...] {{retorted}} the agent, {{rubbing the}} fringe of <b>hair</b> <b>behind</b> his ears. [...] "One thing's certain boys, I don't do nuthin' foolish till I see {{the color of his}} money." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{door was}} again opened, and Greta flew in, her cheeks flushed, her <b>hair</b> {{floating}} <b>behind</b> her, and {{tears streaming down}} her cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Age {{does not}} go by years," [...] said Mrs. Dobbs Broughton. [...] "We all know that. 'His hair was grey, but not with years.' Look here, Conway," [...] and she moved back her tresses from off her temples to show him that there were gray <b>hairs</b> <b>behind.</b> He did not see them; and had they been very visible she might not perhaps have been so ready to exhibit them. [...] "No one can say that length of years has blanched them. I have no secrets from you about my age. One should not be grey before one has reached thirty." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{series of}} staccato taps {{on the west}} window brought Anne flying in from the yard, eyes shining, cheeks faintly flushed with pink, unbraided <b>hair</b> {{streaming}} <b>behind</b> her in a torrent of brightness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, bother, never mind! Come, it's {{time for}} me to learn my lessons. See here what I've got to do," [...] Tom went on, drawing Maggie towards him, and showing her his theorem, while she pushed her <b>hair</b> <b>behind</b> her ears, and {{prepared}} herself to help him in Euclid.|$|E
60|$|The doctor, a black {{figure on}} the green lawn, was, indeed, coming toward them at a very {{vigorous}} walk. His body and gait very much younger than his face, which seemed prematurely lined as with worry; his brow was bald, and projected from the straight, dark <b>hair</b> <b>behind</b> it. He was visibly paler than {{when he left the}} lunch table.|$|E
60|$|It was Robert. This was {{the time}} of day when he knew Miss Fennimore could best {{tolerate}} him, and he seldom failed to make his appearance on his way down-stairs, {{the only one of the}} privileged race who was a wonted object on this side the baize door. Phoebe thought he looked more cheerful, and indeed gravity could hardly have withstood Bertha's face, as she gave a mischievous tweak to his <b>hair</b> <b>behind,</b> under colour of putting her arm round his neck.|$|E
60|$|The Captain {{took off}} his glazed hat, hung it on his hook, and {{smoothing}} his <b>hair</b> from <b>behind</b> with his hand, sat gazing at the group around him: a perfect image of wondering resignation.|$|R
60|$|With almost {{incredible}} fleetness a brown {{figure with}} long black <b>hair</b> streaming <b>behind,</b> darted {{in and out}} among the trees, flashed through the sunlit glade, and vanished in the dark depths of the forest.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was good}} of you," [...] said Mrs. Wallace, when he arrived, {{pointing}} to the roses scattered through the room. She wore three in her <b>hair,</b> trailing <b>behind</b> one ear in an exotic, charming fashion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{and how do}} you do? And I hope you're good children, are you?" [...] said Aunt Glegg, in {{the same}} loud, {{emphatic}} way, as she took their hands, hurting them with her large rings, and kissing their cheeks much against their desire. [...] "Look up, Tom, look up. Boys as go to boarding-schools should hold their heads up. Look at me now." [...] Tom declined that pleasure apparently, for he tried to draw his hand away. [...] "Put your <b>hair</b> <b>behind</b> your ears, Maggie, and keep your frock on your shoulder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, bother! never mind! Come, it's {{time for}} me to learn my lessons. See here! what I've got to do," [...] said Tom, drawing Maggie toward him and showing her his theorem, while she pushed her <b>hair</b> <b>behind</b> her ears, and {{prepared}} herself to prove her capability of helping him in Euclid. She began to read with full confidence in her own powers, but presently, becoming quite bewildered, her face flushed with irritation. It was unavoidable; she must confess her incompetency, and she was not fond of humiliation.|$|E
6000|$|... "'That's what I {{reckoned}} it roughly,' she answered. 'Talk about Romance! And me a slaving the way I {{had all the}} years, when as soon as I ventured out, inside three days, {{this was}} what happened. And what became of the men that mined all that gold? Often and often I wonder about it. They left their horses, loaded and tied, and just disappeared {{off the face of}} the earth, leaving neither hide nor <b>hair</b> <b>behind</b> them. I never heard tell of them. Nobody knows anything about them. Well, being the night-born, I reckon I was their rightful heir.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Deffeyes {{is a big}} {{man with}} a tenured waistline. His <b>hair</b> flies <b>behind</b> him like Ludwig van Beethoven. He lectures in sneakers. His voice is syllabic, elocutionary, operatic. ... His surname rhymes with 'the maze.' [...] "—John Mcphee, Basin and Range (1981) ...|$|R
60|$|The girl's golden <b>hair</b> flowed widely <b>behind</b> her, {{gathered}} in a single braid {{with a piece of}} stovepipe wire.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: William Courtenay, 3rd Viscount Courtenay (c. 1768-1835), later 9th Earl of Devon, {{painted in}} 1793 aged 25. Miniature by Richard Cosway (1742 - 1821). Watercolour on ivory, with {{unidentified}} lock of <b>hair</b> sealed <b>behind,</b> 7.2 cm high. Collection of Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Exeter, purchased 2010 for £24,500 ...|$|R
60|$|There {{lived in}} the great city of Gotham, over against the north gate, a man who possessed a very wise aspect, but very little else. He was tall and lean, and had a fine large head, bald and smooth upon the top, with a circle of white <b>hair</b> <b>behind</b> the ears. His beard was pure white, and reached to his waist; his eyes were small, dark, and so {{piercing}} that they seemed to read your every thought. His eyebrows were very heavy, and as white as his beard. He dressed in a long black mantle with a girdle corded about the middle, and he walked slowly and majestically, and talked no more than he was obliged to.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all, Dick," [...] he corrected. [...] "Well, I {{will have}} a dress ready for you here. You will find it in that corner, {{and there will be}} a bottle of stain on the table. It will be only {{necessary}} for you to colour your neck, hands, and feet, but you must cut off your <b>hair,</b> <b>behind,</b> to a level with your ears, so that none of it will show below the turban. You must do that, of course, before you stain your neck, and must stain the skin where you have cut off your hair, also. I am giving you these instructions now, because when the time comes there may not be a minute to spare, though, of course, I hope there will be no desperate hurry." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the shed}} they played at kisses, really played at kisses. It was a delicious, {{exciting}} game. She turned to him, her face all laughing, like a challenge. And {{he accepted the}} challenge at once. He twined his hand full of her hair, and gently, with his hand wrapped round with <b>hair</b> <b>behind</b> her head, gradually brought her face nearer to his, whilst she laughed breathless with challenge, and his eyes gleamed with answer, with enjoyment of the game. And he kissed her, asserting his will over her, and she kissed him back, asserting her deliberate enjoyment of him. Daring and reckless and dangerous they knew it was, their game, each playing with fire, not with love. A sort of defiance {{of all the world}} possessed her in it--she would kiss him just because she wanted to. And a dare-devilry in him, like a cynicism, a cut at everything he pretended to serve, retaliated in him.|$|E
60|$|When, however, I {{encountered}} Betty, tearing madly {{down the}} beech avenue {{with a couple}} of dogs, her loosened <b>hair</b> streaming <b>behind</b> her like a banner of independence, and had lifted her, hatless and breathless, up before me on my mare, I found that Sara had saved me the trouble of an explanation.|$|R
60|$|I saw no big wigs, {{but some}} wore the <b>hair</b> tied <b>behind</b> {{with a small}} black silk bag {{attached}} to it. Some of the principal men were dressed in black velvet, which became them finely. Some had broad shirt frills of point or Mechlin lace, with wide ruffles of the same round their wrists.|$|R
50|$|The coat is {{long and}} silky and lacks an undercoat. Some Maltese can have curly <b>hair</b> (especially <b>behind</b> their ears), but this is {{considered}} a fault. The colour of the coat is pure white. A pale ivory tinge is permitted on the ears. In some standards, a pure white coat with slight lemon markings is tolerated.|$|R
60|$|Was {{the way to}} Mantua as beautiful, in his time, I wonder! Did it {{wind through}} pasture land as green, bright with the same glancing streams, and dotted with fresh clumps of graceful trees! Those purple {{mountains}} lay on the horizon, then, for certain; and the dresses of these peasant girls, who wear a great, knobbed, silver pin like an English 'life-preserver' through their <b>hair</b> <b>behind,</b> can hardly be much changed. The hopeful feeling of so bright a morning, and so exquisite a sunrise, can have been no stranger, even to an exiled lover's breast; and Mantua itself must have broken on him in the prospect, with its towers, and walls, and water, pretty much as on a commonplace and matrimonial omnibus. He made the same sharp twists and turns, perhaps, over two rumbling drawbridges; passed through the like long, covered, wooden bridge; and leaving the marshy water behind, approached the rusty gate of stagnant Mantua.|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither dog nor cat nor monkey nor any {{creature}} {{that we are}} familiar with. I have tried to reconstruct it from the measurements. Here are four prints where the beast has been standing motionless. You {{see that it is}} no less than fifteen inches from fore-foot to hind. Add to that the length of neck and head, and you get a creature not much less than two feet long--probably more if there is any tail. But now observe this other measurement. The animal has been moving, and we have the length of its stride. In each case it is only about three inches. You have an indication, you see, of a long body with very short legs attached to it. It has not been considerate enough to leave any of its <b>hair</b> <b>behind</b> it. But its general shape must be what I have indicated, and it can run up a curtain, and it is carnivorous." ...|$|E
6000|$|Rilla had a [...] "white night" [...] and did {{not fall}} asleep until late. When she wakened Gertrude Oliver was sitting at her window leaning out to meet the silver mystery of the dawn. Her clever, {{striking}} profile, with the masses of black <b>hair</b> <b>behind</b> it, came out clearly against the pallid gold of the eastern sky. Rilla remembered Jem's admiration of the curve of Miss Oliver's brow and chin, and she shuddered. Everything that reminded her of Jem was beginning to give intolerable pain. Walter's death had inflicted on her heart a terrible wound. But {{it had been a}} clean wound and had healed slowly, as such wounds do, though the scar must remain for ever. But the torture of Jem's disappearance was another thing: there was a poison in it that kept it from healing. The alternations of hope and despair, the endless watching each day for the letter that never came--that might never come--the newspaper tales of ill-usage of prisoners--the bitter wonder as to Jem's wound--all were increasingly hard to bear.|$|E
6000|$|The {{little things}} that none but I [...] Saw were beyond his wont, [...] The {{streaming}} <b>hair,</b> the tie <b>behind,</b> [...] The coat tails worn in front.|$|R
60|$|The {{wind blew}} through Tess's white muslin to her very skin, and her washed <b>hair</b> flew out <b>behind.</b> She was {{determined}} to show no open fear, but she clutched d'Urberville's rein-arm.|$|R
60|$|He put on {{his orders}} and buckled on his sword. The {{gorgeous}} clothes, which had suited him so well {{in the prime of}} his manhood, hung somewhat loosely on his attenuated frame, but he looked a grand and imposing figure, with his white <b>hair</b> tied <b>behind</b> with a great black bow, and the fine jabot of beautiful point d'Angleterre falling in a soft cascade below his chin.|$|R
