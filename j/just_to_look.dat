5|$|Despite {{no longer}} having {{the burden of}} his professorial and garden duties, by the late 1870s the burden of {{maintaining}} himself as the pillar of American botany prevented Gray from the progress he desired on Synoptical Flora of North America, the follow-on to Flora of North America. This burden consisted {{of the fact that}} other scientists often only accepted Gray's word on a botanical matter, and the number of incoming specimens to identify was increasing vastly: numbers had to be assigned to them, collectors needed to be corresponded with, and preliminary papers had to be published. By the early 1880s, Gray's home was the center of everything to do with botany in America. Every aspiring botanist came to see him, even if <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him through his window.|$|E
25|$|When a {{beekeeper}} {{opens the}} hive (to inspect, remove honey, check the queen, or <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>look)</b> and prevents the nurse bees from clustering {{on the frame}} for too long, the brood can become chilled, deforming or even killing some of the bees.|$|E
25|$|On 2 December, orders came {{to move on}} to Trier Airfield, on the Moselle, {{about sixty}} miles from Preutin. The {{squadron}} flew their Salmsons on the receipt of the news. Bad weather {{for the next few days}} slowed the move, however, the work of moving the squadron nevertheless went on, no easy job, as it was a two-day haul. It was at Trier that the 91st had its first opportunity to fly German aircraft turned over to the Allies, and for taking rides in the Fokker or the Pfaltz became a popular pastime. Christmas Day we spent at Trier, the second Christmas in Europe for the squadron, and not by any means a bad day. No one had home comforts as Christmas stockings, but the atmosphere at the dinner given in the hangar by the men at two o'clock, to which all the officers originally in the squadron were invited, was cheerful if not warm. The menu was excellent, and the tree in the center of the hangar was decorated as they were at home, made everyone happy (or homesick, as the case may be), <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at if.|$|E

500|$|These skills, {{as well as}} his {{tastes and}} talents as a causeur, {{consolidated}} his reputation as an erudite in spite of his lack of formal studies. The cultivation of aesthetic goals had seemingly guided the writer throughout his life—the poet and mathematician Ion Barbu, who was one of Caragiale's greatest admirers, recounted with amazement that the writer would periodically visit the Romanian Academy's <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> over a certain page in a manual of arithmetics outlining the rule of three (he reportedly said to Barbu: [...] "Remembering its splendor provides me with a ceaseless drive to reread it"). At the same time, he was attracted by esotericism, alchemy and mystical subjects such as numerology, all of which form background elements in his prose.|$|E
500|$|David Sims, also {{writing for}} The A.V. Club, {{called it a}} fitting end to the season, [...] "leaving {{absolutely}} everyone salivating for season two." [...] Writing for the Star-Ledger, Jenifer Braun praised the episode for its set dressing ("I have to say, it’s a pleasure <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at all the shiny stuff the HBO set dressers came up with for Tywin Lannister's tent") and {{the authenticity of the}} baby dragons ("And wow, HBO, seamless special effects here. Baby Dragon looks every bit as real as the series’ dogs"). HitFix said it [...] "Wrapped up its terrific first season...it was damned entertaining along the way--with the finale as possibly the most entertaining so far--and we know that at least one more season is coming. And if the creative team can keep up this level of quality, it's hard to imagine HBO shutting things down anytime soon, even with a budget that only figures to get higher. Dragons aren't cheap, but they're also amazing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard Morrison of The Times {{described}} Orbit as [...] "like {{an enormous}} wire-mesh fence that has got hopelessly snagged round the bell {{of a giant}} french horn", adding that it [...] "seems like {{an awful lot of}} trouble <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at East London", in comparison to a music hall comedian's refrain at the $16 million cost of the Brooklyn Bridge. Morrison not only compared Johnson [...] to Ozymandias, but also to the 20th century dictators Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Nicolae Ceauşescu, in their acts of [...] "phallic politics" [...] in building grandiose monuments. Criticising the lack of public involvement, he described how it would be an [...] "undesired intrusion by the few into the consciousness of the many". He feared that it could become one of the many [...] "thousands of naff eyesores" [...] of recent public art in Britain, citing the embracing couple at St Pancras station (The Meeting Place), the Dockland's Traffic Light tree, and the proposed Rotherhithe Tunnel 'match-stick man' tribute to Isambard Kingdom Brunel, as London based examples. Fellow Times writer Tom Dyckhoff, while calling it [...] "a gift to the tabloids" [...] and a [...] "giant Mr. Messy", questioned whether the Olympic site needed another pointless icon, postulating whether it would {{stand the test of time}} like the London Eye and become a true icon to match the Eiffel Tower, or a hopeless white elephant. Suggesting the project had echoes of Tatlin's Monument to the Third International, and especially Constant Nieuwenhuys' utopian city New Babylon, he asked whether Orbit was just as revolutionary or possessed the same ideological purpose, or whether it was merely [...] "a giant advert for one of the world’s biggest multinationals, sweetened with a bit of fun".|$|E
