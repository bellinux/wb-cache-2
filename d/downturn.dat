5|$|Like other Rust Belt cities, Utica had an {{economic}} <b>downturn</b> {{beginning in the}} mid-20thcentury. The <b>downturn</b> consisted of industrial decline due to globalization and the closure of textile mills, population loss caused by the relocation of jobs and businesses to suburbs and to Syracuse, and poverty associated with socioeconomic stress and a decreased tax base. With its low cost of living, the city has become a melting pot for refugees from war-torn countries around the world, encouraging growth for its colleges and universities, cultural institutions and economy.|$|E
5|$|The Great Depression in Canada {{during the}} early 1930s saw an {{economic}} <b>downturn,</b> leading to hardship across the country. In response to the <b>downturn,</b> the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state (as pioneered by Tommy Douglas) in the 1940s and 1950s. On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI, seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence.|$|E
40|$|Relying on {{new data}} on the {{ideology}} of heads of government in 27 democracies {{over a period of}} more than 140 years, this article shows that short economic <b>downturns,</b> with a single year of falling per capita consumption, have more often resulted in shifts to the right than shifts to the left. But long-lasting economic <b>downturns,</b> with more than one consecutive year of falling consumption, are different, since they tend to affect a much greater proportion of the population: compared with short <b>downturns,</b> which favor the right, long <b>downturns</b> have more uniform political effects...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how {{fiscal and}} monetary policy typically respond during <b>downturns</b> in G 7 countries. It evaluates whether discretionary fiscal responses to <b>downturns</b> are timely and temporary, and compares {{the response of}} fiscal policy to that of monetary policy. The results suggest that while responding more weakly and less quickly than monetary policy, discretionary fiscal policy is more timely than conventional wisdom would suggest, particularly in "Anglo-Saxon" countries, but the response differs substantially across fiscal instruments. Both fiscal and monetary policy {{are found to be}} subject to an easing bias, with more easing during <b>downturns</b> than tightening during upturnsand liable to easing in response to erroneously perceived <b>downturns,</b> many of which are subsequently revised to expansions...|$|R

25|$|The caudal, or tail {{vertebrae}}, are sharply <b>downturned.</b> The vertebrae at {{the bend}} (called the caudal peduncle) are wedge-shaped with neural spines that are wider at their ends {{than they are}} at their bases. This <b>downturned</b> area likely supported a fluke similar to modern sharks. Two lobes would have been present, a lower one supported by the <b>downturned</b> vertebrae and an upper, unsupported one. The tail fluke was probably hypocercal, meaning that its lower lobe was longer than its upper lobe. This condition is also seen in ichthyosaurs and metriorhynchid crocodyliforms.|$|R

40|$|In {{industries}} that display cyclical industrial dynamics, {{such as the}} Semiconductor industry and Flat Panel Display industry, firms are forced to strategize around upturns and <b>downturns.</b> Some firms such as Intel and Texas Instruments have learnt how to seize advantages from such fluctuations, to launch new business ventures and products or to restructure their operations during <b>downturns.</b> In the Flat Panel Display industry, firms seeking to enter the industry have learnt to time their entry to coincide with <b>downturns.</b> Such counter-cyclical investment strategies are lending firms that master them significant advantages. This article builds on a dynamic approach to strategy to capture the principal features of strategizing during upturns and <b>downturns,</b> and in particular demonstrates the rewards flowing to firms that engage in counter-cyclical investment strategies. 31 page(s...|$|R

These patterns are consistent with a boom-bust view of housing price dynamics, where booms represent departures from fundamentals that are increasingly difficult to sustain and busts serve as readjustment periods. Findings are robust to the inclusion of macroeconomic variables, which allow for the estimation of additional determinants of house price expansions and contractions...|$|R

40|$|ACL- 3 International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} regime-dependent model to {{estimate}} fiscal multipliers in the US. Output, consumption and investment {{are assumed to}} respond to tax and spending changes in a nonlinear manner. Fiscal multipliers are time-varying because their size and sign depend upon {{the state of the}} economy (upturns and <b>downturns).</b> Keynesian effects appear essentially during <b>downturns,</b> while anti-Keynesian effects are observed during expansions. Transfer payments contributes to a higher private consumption when they are given to consumers in bad times. Reducing taxes boosts consumption in good times. Investment responds positively to lower taxes during <b>downturns,</b> but negatively in the upturn regime. Our results thus suggest that Keynesian effects have been associated to expansionary policies during recessions, while anti-Keynesian effects were observed during expansions illustrating situations of expansionary fiscal consolidation. The effectiveness of fiscal positive impulses increases in <b>downturns</b> relative to upturns. A corollary is therefore that austerity measures during recessions would have detrimental effects on the GDP and its components...|$|R
