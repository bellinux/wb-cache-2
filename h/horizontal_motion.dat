The empennage consisted of vertical and horizontal vanes arranged like the fletching of an arrow, behind which the vertical rudder was mounted. During a refit in 1907 the vertical vanes of the empennage were modified, as is shown in the accompanying illustration.|$|E
5|$|For visual course control, flies' optic {{flow field}} is {{analyzed}} {{by a set}} of motion-sensitive neurons. A subset of these neurons is thought to be involved in using the optic flow to estimate the parameters of self-motion, such as yaw, roll, and sideward translation. Other neurons are thought to be involved in analyzing the content of the visual scene itself, such as separating figures from the ground using motion parallax. The H1 neuron is responsible for detecting <b>horizontal</b> <b>motion</b> across the entire visual field of the fly, allowing the fly to generate and guide stabilizing motor corrections midflight with respect to yaw. The ocelli are concerned in the detection of changes in light intensity, enabling the fly to react swiftly to the approach of an object.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} of offshore loading and discharge are the relative <b>horizontal</b> <b>motions</b> between the HTV and its cargo which must be controlled, to ensure safe and reliable operations. Optimization of the cargo handling system is needed to control the relative <b>horizontal</b> <b>motions.</b> This study investigates whether the mooring device ShoreTension will minimize the relative <b>horizontal</b> <b>motions</b> between a HTV and a cargo, when it is used as the cargo handling system during offshore loading and discharge operations. A MATLAB function of ShoreTension is developed, which is implemented into AQWA to predict the relative <b>horizontal</b> <b>motions</b> between the HTV and the cargo in time. Multiple simulations have been performed, {{each with its own}} cargo handling system. A simplified MATLAB mass-spring-ShoreTension model resembling the HTV and the cargo is set up to determine why and when ShoreTension reduces motions. A cargo handling system including ShoreTension cannot reduce the high-, wave-frequent relative <b>horizontal</b> <b>motions</b> occurring between the HTV and the cargo, as they are induced by an excitation frequency far beyond the natural frequency of the original system. Furthermore, a cargo handling system including ShoreTension should be able to lower the low-frequent relative <b>horizontal</b> <b>motions,</b> which are the result of resonance; by increasing the stiffness and by adding damping through giving out and heaving in the mooring line. The optimal configuration has not yet been found. It is recommended to further investigate in how ShoreTension should be outfitted as cargo handling system such that the low-frequent relative <b>horizontal</b> <b>motions</b> are minimized.

40|$|Abstract. The {{source of}} coronal {{magnetic}} energy and helicity lies {{below the surface}} of the sun, probably in the convective zone dynamo. Measurements of magnetic and velocity elds can capture the uxes of both magnetic energy and helicity crossing the photosphere. We point out the ambiguities which can occur when observations are used to compute these uxes. In particular, we show that these uxes should be computed only from the <b>horizontal</b> <b>motions</b> deduced by tracking the photospheric cut of magnetic ux tubes. These <b>horizontal</b> <b>motions</b> include the eect of both the emergence and the shearing motions what ever the magnetic conguration com-plexity is. We nally analyze the observational diculties involved in deriving such uxes, in particular the limitations of the correlation tracking methods...|$|R
40|$|Field {{observations}} on ground motions from recent earthquakes imply that current knowledge is limited {{with regard to}} relating vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>motions</b> at liquefiable sites. This paper describes a study {{with the purpose of}} clarifying this emerging issue to some extent. A series of numerical analyses is carried out on a liquefiable soil deposit with a verified, fully coupled, nonlinear procedure. It is shown that the transformation of vertical motions in the deposit differs considerably from the transformation of <b>horizontal</b> <b>motions.</b> Both the amplitude and frequency content of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>motions</b> are strongly dependent on the shaking level or the associated nonlinear soil behavior. The transfer function for vertical motions is however likely to be independent of the intensity of input motions; no reduction in the amplitude occurs even in the case of strong shaking. The results are shown to be in consistence with the laboratory {{observations on}} shaking table tests and recent field observations that less nonlinearity exists for vertical motions. It is also shown that the possibility exists for using information on spectral ratios between the horizontal and vertical surface motions to quickly identify in situ soil behavior and liquefaction that are not readily covered by conventional field or laboratory experimentation procedures. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

25|$|In a non-inertial {{reference}} frame in classical physics and special relativity, {{the physics of}} a system {{vary depending on the}} acceleration of that frame with respect to an inertial frame, and the usual physical forces must be supplemented by fictitious forces. In contrast, systems in non-inertial frames in general relativity don't have external causes, because of the principle of geodesic motion. In classical physics, for example, a ball dropped towards the ground does not go exactly straight down because the Earth is rotating, which means the frame of reference of an observer on Earth is not inertial. The physics must account for the Coriolis effectin this case thought of as a forceto predict the <b>horizontal</b> <b>motion.</b> Another example of such a fictitious force associated with rotating {{reference frame}}s is the centrifugal effect, or centrifugal force.|$|E
25|$|As {{a matter}} of {{principle}} a power source (such as a waterwheel) is installed {{as close as possible to}} the equipment that it drives (such as a water pump), to minimise the inevitable loss of power incurred in its transmission. When the distance between source and target is significant an efficient means of transferring the power is necessary, and in the 19th century the best method available was the flatrod system. This was used at a number of mines and consisted of a series of linked iron or wooden rods connected to a crank on a waterwheel (or steam engine). The crank converted the circular motion of the wheel into an oscillatory back-and-forth motion of the rods which, suitably supported, could be extended for some distance along the ground. A heavy weight, known as the balance bob, pivoted on one or both ends of the run of the rods kept them under tension and allowed the conversion of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>motion</b> to vertical motion down the shaft.|$|E

These the 'vertical tectonics' model, in which little horizontal surface displacement results from mantle flow; the 'plate divergence' model, in which shear strain from large horizontal displacements is accommodated only in narrow zones of deformation; and the 'distributed deformation' model, in which strain from large <b>horizontal</b> <b>motions</b> is broadly accommodated. No convincing observational evidence was found to support the rigid-plate divergence, while the evidence of large-scale <b>horizontal</b> <b>motions</b> of Aphrodite argues against purely vertical tectonics.

2500|$|Essential tremor (sometimes called benign {{essential}} tremor) is {{the most}} common of the more than 20 types of tremor.

[...] Head tremor may be seen as a vertical or <b>horizontal</b> <b>motion.</b> Essential tremor may be accompanied by mild gait disturbance.

[...] Onset is most common after age 40, although symptoms can appear at any age. [...] It may occur in more than one family member.

2500|$|The machine had {{a feature}} called [...] "Stroke Storage" [...] that {{prevented}} two keys from being depressed simultaneously. When a key was depressed, an interposer, beneath the keylever, was pushed {{down into a}} slotted tube full of small metal balls (called the [...] "compensator tube") and spring latched. These balls were adjusted to have enough horizontal space for only one interposer to enter at a time. (Mechanisms much like this were used in keyboards for teleprinters before World War II.) If a typist pressed two keys simultaneously both interposers were blocked from entering the tube. [...] Pressing two keys several milliseconds apart allows the first interposer to enter the tube, tripping a clutch which rotated a fluted shaft driving the interposer horizontally {{and out of the}} tube. The powered <b>horizontal</b> <b>motion</b> of the interposer selected the appropriate rotate and tilt of the printhead for character selection, but also made way for the second interposer to enter the tube some milliseconds later, well before the first character had been printed. While a full print cycle was 65 milliseconds this filtering and storage feature allowed the typist to depress keys in a more random fashion and still print the characters in the sequence entered.|$|E

These flows {{are considered to be}} a manifestation of the sub-photospheric convection. Aims: The characteristics of moats are derived at two different heights in the solar atmosphere from <b>horizontal</b> <b>motions</b> around sunspots of different sizes, shapes, and phases of evolution. We also study the temporal evolution of moats. Methods: Local correlation tracking is applied to approximately 70 -min long time series of white-light and 1600 Å images, acquired by the satellite TRACE, to analyse the <b>horizontal</b> <b>motions</b> of photospheric granules and C IV emission structures in the vicinity of 32 sunspots. Moat regions are defined by means of radially-oriented, outward velocities. Results: Relations between sunspot types and the occurrence, areas, and horizontal velocities of moats in the photosphere and transition region are described. Moats do not show substantial changes during the period of about 12 h. Observed asymmetries in moat shapes and velocities are related to the height in the atmosphere, to sunspot age, and to proper motion. It is suggested that the sub-photospheric convective flows around sunspots may be influenced by the spots' proper motion through the convection zone...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{southern}} Tibet, ongoing {{vertical and}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>motions</b> {{due to the}} collision between India and Eurasia are monitored by large numbers of global positioning system (GPS) continuous and campaign sites installed in the past decade. Displacements measured by GPS usually include tectonic deformation as well as non-tectonic, time-dependent signals. To estimate the regional long-term tectonic deformation using GPS more precisely, seasonal elastic deformation signals associated with surface loading must {{be removed from the}} observations. In this study, we focus on seasonal variation in vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>motions</b> of southern Tibet by performing a joint analysis of GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) and GPS data, not only using continuous sites but also GPS campaign-mode sites. We found that the GPS-observed and GRACE-modeled seasonal oscillations are in good agreements, and a seasonal displacement model demonstrates that the main reason for seasonal variations in southern Tibet is from the summer monsoon and its precipitation. The biggest loading appears from July to August in the summer season. Vertical deformations observed by GPS and modeled by GRACE are two to three times larger than horizontal oscillations, and the north components demonstrate larger amplitudes than the east components.
