5|$|In 1994 the Sydney Theatre Company {{commissioned}} Enright {{to develop}} the original 45-minute play into a full-length production. Blackrock retained the original four characters but also added nine others. It also extended {{the length of the}} play, and was considered to be a more fictionalised version of Leigh's murder, though many viewers still considered it to be a factual account of the crime. The narrative and emphasis were reshaped for an adult audience outside of a specifically <b>educational</b> <b>environment,</b> also shifting the plays focus. While A Property of the Clan focused on the possible motives for rape, Blackrock was said to focus on the boys involved in the crime, portraying them as victims of the society they live in.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that SAT scores systematically underestimate future performance of minority students. However, the predictive validity of the SAT has been shown to depend on the dominant ethnic and racial composition of the college. Some studies have also shown that African American students under-perform in college relative to their white peers with the same SAT scores; researchers have argued that this is likely because white students tend to benefit from social advantages outside of the <b>educational</b> <b>environment</b> (for example, high parental involvement in their education, inclusion in campus academic activities, positive bias from same-race teachers and peers) which result in better grades.|$|E
25|$|JSL is a romanization {{system based}} on Japanese phonology, {{designed}} using the linguistic principles used by linguists in designing writing systems for languages {{that do not have}} any. It is a purely phonemic system, using exactly one symbol for each phoneme, and marking pitch accent using diacritics. It was created for Eleanor Harz Jorden's system of Japanese language teaching. Its principle is that such a system enables students to better internalize the phonology of Japanese. Since it does not have any of the advantages for non-native speakers that the other systems have, and the Japanese already have a writing system for their language, JSL is not widely used outside the <b>educational</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E
40|$|Universities have {{to respond}} to the needs of society, governments, {{companies}} and individuals. The main activities in universities are fundamental or applied research and studies, providing competencies and knowledge necessary for students’ professional careers. Therefore, universities should prepare future professionals for collective activities in their future work places – organizations. Universities which base their ethos on modern educational paradigm practice student-oriented studies. Students and the teacher co-construct the curriculum and peer-learning is employed for deeper learning and better results. The whole study process is based on creating empowering <b>educational</b> <b>environments</b> which engage and stimulate deep learning. According to Salmon (2000), effective university <b>educational</b> <b>environments</b> have to promote collaborative learning, empower deeper learning, engage students in real problem-solving to develop skills that are necessary in real life environments and provide students with the experiences, challenges and opportunities which occur in the 21 st century. It requires creating real organizational environments (Munro and Cook, 2008), and even if students feel very engaged in their team performance and problem-solving, they still identify themselves as university students, not as members of an organization (Kahu, 2013). Thus, there is a essential to define how university <b>educational</b> <b>environments</b> that empower students’ organizational learning should be designed. Various educational systems, such as collaborative learning, problem learning, service learning can be used for developing organisational learning competence, but {{there is a lack of}} a holistic educational system dedicated for this purpose only. This dissertation is dedicated to answer this interdisciplinary research problem: how should the <b>educational</b> <b>environments</b> for organisational learning be designed to empower students’ individual and collective learning with the purpose to develop subject knowledge and organisational learning competences? The research object is students’ individual and organisational learning in the <b>educational</b> <b>environments</b> for students’ organizational learning. The research aim is to disclose students’ individual and collective learning in the <b>educational</b> <b>environments</b> for students’ organizational learning...|$|R

25|$|In {{a fitting}} {{tribute to the}} legacy of Clerk, other West Indian missionaries and the Basel Mission, the British Governor of the Gold Coast during World War I, Frederick Gordon Guggisberg, reacted to the {{expulsion}} of Basel Mission as alien security risk from the Gold Coast by lamenting that, the forced departure was “the greatest blow which education {{in this country has}} ever suffered;” describing their work as the “first and foremost as regards quality of education and character training” – a testament to the mission’s approach of combining academic study with practical training for life. While propagation of the Gospel was the main objective of the West Indians and the Basel Mission, the domestic socioeconomic and dire <b>educational</b> <b>environment</b> motivated them to establish the first formal schools and colleges in the country, open to pupils from all walks of life. Moreover, the missionaries provided alternative sources of employment to rural inhabitants through the establishment of mechanized agriculture and commerce-driven small-scale industries such as construction and craftsmanship including printing, tile manufacturing and weaving in order to create self-sufficiency among the natives.|$|E
25|$|In the US, Latino/as who {{identify}} as LGBTQ face scrutiny {{not just from}} their community at home but within their community at school as well, especially within a {{high school or college}} preparation experience. While facing scrutiny by family and community to maintain gender normality in order to prosper in the US, they also must face scrutiny from their fellow peers, mentors and administration in the <b>educational</b> <b>environment.</b> One such scrutiny that they face is a lack of acceptance and recognition as a separate educational entity within sexual educational programs, provided by many high school education districts. Lesson plans that are developed for the high school learning environment put emphasis on Heteronormativity of the and Latino students. Latinas are viewed as needing to have less interest in sexual education, while Latinos were told to maintain focus and to take the education seriously. When teachers are prompted to explain more about sexual education for lesbians or gays, the teachers or educators assume the student body to be heterosexual and refuse or regard the questions as immature and outside the scope of their teaching.|$|E
