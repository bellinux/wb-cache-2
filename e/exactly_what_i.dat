5|$|Cohesion between {{sentences}} is achieved {{through the use}} of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. that is <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event). Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true! (the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief), or boy! I'm hungry (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.|$|E
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E

500|$|In 1953, Levin {{applied for}} a job on the weekly {{periodical}} Truth. The paper had recently {{been taken over by}} the liberal publisher Ronald Staples who together with his new editor Vincent Evans was determined to cleanse it of its previous right-wing racist reputation. Levin's noticeably Jewish surname, together with such skills as he had acquired in shorthand and typing, gained him immediate acceptance. He was offered the post of [...] "general editorial dogsbody, which was <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had been looking for". After a year, Evans left and was succeeded by his deputy, George Scott; Levin was promoted in Scott's place. He wrote for the paper under a variety of pseudonyms, including [...] "A.E.Cherryman".|$|E
500|$|Wellman {{frequently}} {{conflicted with}} the military officers brought in to supervise the picture, especially the infantry commander whom he considered to have [...] "two monumental hatreds: fliers and movie people". After one argument Wellman retorted to the commander, [...] "You're just a goddamn fool because the government has told me {{you have to give}} me all your men and do just <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want you to do." [...] Although Wellman paid much attention to technical details in shooting, he used cars and clothing of the year during the filming, forgetting to use those of World War I. He took six weeks to fully edit the film and prepare it for release.|$|E
500|$|Screenwriter Ian Watson has speculated, [...] "Worldwide, A.I. {{was very}} {{successful}} (and the 4th highest earner of the year) but it didn't do quite so well in America, because the film, so I'm told, was too poetical and intellectual in general for American tastes. Plus, quite a few critics in America misunderstood the film, thinking for instance that the Giacometti-style beings in the final 20 minutes were aliens (whereas they were robots of the future who had evolved themselves from the robots in the earlier part of the film) and also thinking that the final 20 minutes were a sentimental addition by Spielberg, whereas those scenes were <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wrote for Stanley and exactly what he wanted, filmed faithfully by Spielberg." ...|$|E

500|$|Lovato's fifth album, Confident, was {{released}} on October 16, 2015, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 98,000 copies. During the album's production, Lovato commented: [...] "I've already started recording for my new album, and I have plans to record during the tour. The sound just evolves into everything that I've been and everything that I want to become." [...] She further stated, [...] "I've never been so sure of myself as an artist {{when it comes down}} to confidence, but not only personal things, but <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want my sound to be and what I know I'm capable of and this album will give me the opportunity to show people what I can really do." ...|$|E

Those outfits achieve <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was trying to achieve. There's flamboyance, there's real risk-taking, but when I walk into the room, it's not flashy. It's actually very subtle. You look at it and you go, [...] "That shirt, that tie, that jacket, that vest? What?" [...] But it works.|$|E
500|$|After partnering {{for one of}} Kindt's {{previous}} works, , Dark Horse Publisher Mike Richardson asked Kindt {{to pitch}} another book. Kindt sent the proposal for MIND MGMT and was happy when it was accepted because Dark Horse was [...] "the only publisher able to pay me a living wage and also let me do <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted no matter what." [...] The series was initially approved for over 50 issues, but Kindt pruned away excess material and reduced the run to 36 issues. Despite the reduction in length, the final product is still almost {{identical to the original}} pitch. Diana Schutz, editor of 3 Story, was originally slated to work with Kindt again, but the project was handed to newly promoted editor Brendan Wright very early in production. Kindt described their input as [...] "invaluable" [...] and considers Wright to be a collaborator.|$|E

500|$|Ben Croshaw of Zero Punctuation {{gave the}} game the only entirely {{positive}} review in the show's history, calling it [...] "the most fun you'll have with your PC until they invent a force-feedback codpiece". Croshaw went on to say: [...] "I went in expecting a slew of interesting portal-based puzzles and that's <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> got, but what I wasn't expecting was some of the funniest pitch black humor I've ever heard in a game". He states that, while the game was short, the two- to three-hour length of the game was perfect as the game did not outstay its welcome, and called the ending [...] "balls-tighteningly fantastic", while praising the game as [...] "absolutely sublime from start to finish" [...] (adding that he would jam forks in his eyes if he ever praised a game so highly ever again).|$|E
500|$|The {{writing of}} [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] was {{completed}} by Jackson as he watched cartoons with Paul McCartney. Producer Quincy Jones had initially told Jackson to write a song about two men fighting over a girl. Inspired, Jackson awoke during the night and sang the song into a tape recorder. He later said, [...] "I sang <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> heard in my head, starting with the melody and the keyboard and the strings and everything. So, I just orally put it all on tape." [...] Jones also asked Jackson to add a rap verse. The song was then recorded by Jackson and McCartney at Westlake Studios, Los Angeles, from April 14 to 16, 1982. The year before, the duo had recorded [...] "Say Say Say" [...] and [...] "The Man" [...] for McCartney's fifth solo album, Pipes of Peace (1983).|$|E
500|$|Jackson was {{influenced}} by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I {{had never seen a}} performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do {{for the rest of my}} life because of James Brown." ...|$|E

500|$|Stravinsky first {{conducted}} {{the work in}} 1926, in a concert given by the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam; two years later he {{brought it to the}} Salle Pleyel in Paris for two performances under his baton. Of these occasions he later wrote that [...] "thanks to the experience I had gained with all kinds of orchestras... I had reached a point where I could obtain <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted, as I wanted it". Commentators have broadly agreed that the work has had a greater impact in the concert hall than it has on the stage; many of Stravinsky's revisions to the music were made with the concert hall rather than the theatre in mind. The work has become a staple in the repertoires of all the leading orchestras, and has been cited by Leonard Bernstein as [...] "the most important piece of music of the 20th century".|$|E
500|$|Martin {{influenced}} {{several of}} her songs. [...] While showering one day during rehearsals, {{she came up with}} the idea for a scene in which she would shampoo her hair onstage. [...] This gave rise to [...] "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair". Built around a primitive shower that Logan remembered from his time in the military, the song became one of the most talked-about in South Pacific. To introduce another of Martin's numbers to her, Rodgers called her over to his apartment, where he and Hammerstein played [...] "I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy" [...] for her. [...] When Martin essayed it for herself, she sang the final 26 words, as intended, with a single breath, and fell off her piano bench. [...] Rodgers gazed down at her, [...] "That's <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want. [...] Never do it differently. [...] We must feel you couldn't squeeze out another sound." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Criminal" [...] {{was written}} in 2008 by Max Martin, Shellback and Tiffany Amber, and was {{produced}} by Martin and Shellback. Spears told MTV News that after she first listened to the song, she felt it was different and unlike anything she had heard before. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Spears spoke about Martin's productions on Femme Fatale, saying, [...] "Max played a huge role on this album {{and he has been}} there since the beginning so there is such a huge level of trust. He gets <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am saying when I tell him what I want and don’t want musically". Spears recorded her vocals at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The track was later mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. It was registered on Broadcast Music Incorporated under the legal title [...] "In Love With a Criminal". On March 2, 2011, Spears posted on her Twitter account a link to a 17-second clip of the song, describing it as [...] "one of [...] favorites".|$|E
