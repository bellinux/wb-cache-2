5|$|Terpenes and isoprenoids, {{including}} the carotenoids, {{are made by}} the assembly and modification of isoprene units donated from the reactive precursors <b>isopentenyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate.

In animals and archaea, the mevalonate pathway produces these compounds from acetyl-CoA, while in plants and bacteria the non-mevalonate pathway uses pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrates. One important reaction that uses these activated isoprene donors is steroid biosynthesis. Here, the isoprene units are joined together to make squalene and then folded up and formed into a set of rings to make lanosterol.

40|$|Isoprenoids {{constitute}} an important class of biomolecules that participate {{in many different}} cellular processes. Most available detection methods allow the identification of {{only one or two}} specific nonsterol isoprenoid intermediates following radioactive or fluorescent labeling. We here report a rapid, nonradioactive, and sensitive procedure for the simultaneous detection and quantification of the eight main nonsterol intermediates of the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway by means of tandem mass spectrometry. Intermediates were analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS in the multiple reaction monitoring mode using a silica-based C- 18 HPLC column. For quantification, their stable isotope-labeled analogs were used as internal standards. HepG 2 cells were used to validate the method. Mevalonate, phosphomevalonate, and the six subsequent isoprenoid pyrophosphates were readily determined with detection limits ranging from 0. 03 to 1. 0 mu mol/L. The intra- and interassay variations for HepG 2 cell homogenates supplemented with isoprenoid intermediates were 3. 6 - 10. 9 and 4. 4 - 11. 9 %, respectively. Under normal culturing conditions, isoprenoid intermediates in HepG 2 cells were below detection limits. However, incubation of the cells with pamidronate, an inhibitor of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, resulted in increased levels of mevalonate, <b>isopentenyl</b> pyrophosphate/dimethylallyl <b>pyrophosphate,</b> and geranyl pyrophosphate. This method will be suitable for measuring profiles of isoprenoid intermediates in cells with compromised isoprenoid biosynthesis and for determining the specificity of potential inhibitors of the pathway.

40|$|Pyrophosphates {{are the key}} {{intermediates}} in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, {{and their}} concentrations could revealthe benefits of statins in cardiovascular diseases. Quantitative analysis of five <b>pyrophosphates,</b> including <b>isopentenyl</b> pyrophosphate(IPP), dimethylallyl <b>pyrophosphate</b> (DMAPP), geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP), was performed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in negative ionizationmode. After dilution with methanol, samples were separated on a 3 μm particle multi-modal C 18 column (50 × 2 mm) and quantified within 10 min. The gradient elution consists of 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 0. 5 % triethylamine (TEA) inwater and 0. 1 % TEA in 80 % acetonitrile was used at the flow rate of 0. 4 mL/min. Overall recoveries were 51. 4 - 106. 6 %, whilethe limit of quantification was 0. 05 μg/mL for GPP and FPP and 0. 1 μg/mL for IPP, DMAPP, and GGPP. The precision (% CV) and accuracy (% bias) of the assay were 1. 9 - 12. 3 % and 89. 6 - 111. 8 %, respectively, in 0. 05 - 10 μg/mL calibration ranges (R 2 > 0. 993).

25|$|Apicoplasts {{have lost}} all {{photosynthetic}} function, and contain no photosynthetic pigments or true thylakoids. They are bounded by four membranes, but the membranes {{are not connected}} to the endoplasmic reticulum. The fact that apicomplexans still keep their nonphotosynthetic chloroplast around demonstrates how the chloroplast carries out important functions other than photosynthesis. Plant chloroplasts provide plant cells with many important things besides sugar, and apicoplasts are no different—they synthesize fatty acids, <b>isopentenyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate,</b> iron-sulfur clusters, and carry out part of the heme pathway. This makes the apicoplast an attractive target for drugs to cure apicomplexan-related diseases. The most important apicoplast function is <b>isopentenyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> synthesis—in fact, apicomplexans die when something interferes with this apicoplast function, and when apicomplexans are grown in an isopentenyl pyrophosphate-rich medium, they dump the organelle.|$|E
25|$|Rubber {{particles}} are {{formed in the}} cytoplasm of specialized latex-producing cells called laticifers within rubber plants. Rubber {{particles are}} surrounded by a single phospholipid membrane with hydrophobic tails pointed inward. The membrane allows biosynthetic proteins to be sequestered at {{the surface of the}} growing rubber particle, which allows new monomeric units to be added from outside the biomembrane, but within the lacticifer. The rubber particle is an enzymatically active entity that contains three layers of material, the rubber particle, a biomembrane and free monomeric units. The biomembrane is held tightly to the rubber core due to the high negative charge along the double bonds of the rubber polymer backbone. Free monomeric units and conjugated proteins make up the outer layer. The rubber precursor is <b>isopentenyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> (an allylic compound), which elongates by Mg2+-dependent condensation by the action of rubber transferase. The monomer adds to the pyrophosphate end of the growing polymer. The process displaces the terminal high-energy pyrophosphate. The reaction produces a cis polymer. The initiation step is catalyzed by prenyltransferase, which converts three monomers of <b>isopentenyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> into farnesyl pyrophosphate. The farnesyl pyrophosphate can bind to rubber transferase to elongate a new rubber polymer.|$|E
25|$|The {{required}} <b>isopentenyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> {{is obtained}} from the mevalonate pathway, which derives from acetyl-CoA in the cytosol. In plants, isoprene pyrophosphate can also be {{obtained from the}} 1-deox-D-xyulose-5-phosphate/2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway within plasmids. The relative ratio of the farnesyl pyrophosphate initiator unit and isoprenyl pyrophosphate elongation monomer determines the rate of new particle synthesis versus elongation of existing particles. Though rubber is known to be produced by only one enzyme, extracts of latex host numerous small molecular weight proteins with unknown function. The proteins possibly serve as cofactors, as the synthetic rate decreases with complete removal.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} {{cell organelle}} is apical complex, {{which is actually}} a combination of organelles. It contains secretory organelles called rhoptries and micronemes, which are vital for mobility, adhesion, host cell invasion, and parasitophorous vacuole formation. As an apicomplexan, it harbours a plastid, an apicoplast, similar to plant chloroplasts, which they probably acquired by engulfing (or being invaded by) a eukaryotic alga and retaining the algal plastid as a distinctive organelle encased within four membranes. The apicoplast {{is involved in the}} synthesis of lipids and several other compounds and provides an attractive drug target. During the asexual blood stage of infection, the essential function of the apicoplast is to produce the isoprenoid intermediate <b>isopentenyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The unconditioned {{biosynthesis}} of lycopene in eukaryotic {{plants and}} in prokaryotic cyanobacteria is similar, {{as are the}} enzymes involved. Synthesis begins with mevalonic acid, which is converted into dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. [...] This is then condensed with three molecules of <b>isopentenyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> (an isomer of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate), to give the twenty-carbon geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. [...] Two molecules of this product are then condensed in a tail-to-tail configuration to give the forty-carbon phytoene, the first committed step in carotenoid biosynthesis. [...] Through several desaturation steps, phytoene is converted into lycopene. [...] The two terminal isoprene groups of lycopene can be cyclized to produce beta-carotene, which can then {{be transformed into a}} wide variety of xanthophylls.|$|E
2500|$|Gamma delta T cells (γδ T cells) {{represent}} a small subset of T cells that possess a distinct T cell receptor (TCR) on their surfaces. [...] A majority of T cells have a TCR {{composed of two}} glycoprotein chains called α- and β- TCR chains. [...] However, in γδ T cells, the TCR {{is made up of}} one γ-chain and one δ-chain. [...] This group of T cells is much less common in humans and mice (about 2% of total T cells); and are found mostly in the gut mucosa, within a population of lymphocytes known as intraepithelial lymphocytes. [...] In rabbits, sheep, and chickens, the number of γδ T cells can be as high as 60% of total T cells. [...] The antigenic molecules that activate γδ T cells are still widely unknown. [...] However, γδ T cells are not MHC-restricted and {{seem to be able to}} recognize whole proteins rather than requiring peptides to be presented by MHC molecules on APCs. [...] Some murine γδ T cells recognize MHC class IB molecules, though. [...] Human Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells, which constitute the major γδ [...] T cell population in peripheral blood, are unique in that they specifically and rapidly respond to a set of nonpeptidic phosphorylated isoprenoid precursors, collectively named phosphoantigens, which are produced by virtually all living cells. [...] The most common phosphoantigens from animal and human cells (including cancer cells) are <b>isopentenyl</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMPP). [...] Many microbes produce the highly active compound hydroxy-DMAPP (HMB-PP) and corresponding mononucleotide conjugates, in addition to IPP and DMAPP. [...] Plant cells produce both types of phosphoantigens. [...] Drugs activating human Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells comprise synthetic phosphoantigens and aminobisphosphonates, which upregulate endogenous IPP/DMAPP.|$|E
