5|$|Neutrophil granulocytes—the most {{abundant}} type of white blood cell—enter the muscle tissue, producing an inflammatory reaction and releasing reactive oxygen species, particularly after crush injury. Crush syndrome may also cause reperfusion injury when blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> decompressed muscle is suddenly restored.|$|E
5|$|About 40percent of the tributaries that {{originally}} flowed {{over the surface}} of the watershed were piped or relocated during urban development, especially {{on the north side of}} the main stem. Generally, the remaining free-flowing tributaries begin south of the main stem and run north; the major exception is Crystal Springs Creek, which begins as a groundwater discharge and flows south. The other major tributaries are Hogan, Kelley, Butler, Sunshine, and Badger creeks. Crystal Springs and Kelley creeks contribute more <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> the main stem than the other tributaries.|$|E
5|$|Black Creek is an ephemeral stream. It used {{to drain}} an area between Turtle Creek and the Susquehanna River, but now loses its <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> {{underground}} mines via broken bedrock. Its channel is also disrupted by strip mines and rock piles. The waters of Black Creek are acidic.|$|E
40|$|FDI <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> the MENA {{region have}} been disappointing {{relative}} to other developing countries. Using fixed effects panel regressions, this paper investigates whether the determinants of FDI affect MENA countries differently. The results indicate {{that some of the}} variables that influence FDI <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> developing countries are not important for <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> MENA countries. These include the rate of return on investment, infrastructures, economic growth, and inflation. While trade openness increases FDI <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> MENA countries, corruption/bureaucratic red tape were found <b>to</b> reduce <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> the region. Thus, trade liberalization and privatization are important preconditions for FDI <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> the region...|$|R

5|$|Certain {{facilities}} are {{equipped to handle}} TBI better than others; initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate treatment center. Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply, maintaining adequate blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> the brain, and controlling raised intracranial pressure (ICP), since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed blood flow and can cause deadly brain herniation. Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures. Some data supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Fritz Joubert Duquesne, a Boer and German spy, {{claimed to}} have assumed the {{identity}} of Russian Count Boris Zakrevsky and joined Kitchener in Scotland. Duquesne supposedly signalled a German U-boat shortly after departing Scapa <b>Flow</b> <b>to</b> alert them that Kitchener’s ship was approaching. He was then rescued by the submarine as Hampshire sank. In the 1930s and '40s, he ran the Duquesne Spy Ring and was captured by the FBI along with 32 other Nazi agents in the largest espionage conviction in U.S. history.|$|E
5|$|In 1948 Shive {{invented the}} {{phototransistor}} that used {{a beam of}} light, instead of a wire, as the emitter of a point contact transistor, generating holes that <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> the collector.

When you measure {{distance of the}} main fjord and the Austgulfjorden (the longest of its branches), it is 22 km long.|$|R

Turija river (and {{several of its}} tributraries, {{including}} Sibnička reka), which springs right below the mountain and <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> the west into the Kolubara River.

5|$|In {{order for}} the <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> be well defined, the given curve must be {{sufficiently}} smooth {{that it has a}} continuous curvature. However, once the flow starts, the curve becomes analytic, and remains so until reaching a singularity at which the curvature blows up. For a smooth curve without crossings, the only possible singularity happens when the curve collapses to a point, but immersed curves can have other types of singularity.|$|E
5|$|In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosystem II uses {{light energy}} to remove {{electrons}} from water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The electrons then <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> the cytochrome b6f complex, which uses their energy to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast. These protons move {{back through the}} membrane as they drive the ATP synthase, as before. The electrons then flow through photosystem I and can then either be used to reduce the coenzyme NADP+, {{for use in the}} Calvin cycle, which is discussed below, or recycled for further ATP generation.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to extend {{the definition of the}} <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> more general inputs than curves, for instance by using rectifiable varifolds or the level set method. However, these extended definitions may allow parts of curves to vanish instantaneously or fatten into sets of nonzero area.|$|E

5|$|Narcosis {{has been}} {{compared}} with altitude sickness regarding its variability of onset (though not its symptoms); its effects depend on many factors, with variations between individuals. Thermal cold, stress, heavy work, fatigue, and carbon dioxide retention all increase the risk and severity of narcosis. Carbon dioxide has a high narcotic potential and also causes increased blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> the brain, increasing the effects of other gases. Increased risk of narcosis results from {{increasing the amount of}} carbon dioxide retained through heavy exercise, shallow or skip breathing, or because of poor gas exchange in the lungs.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{property}} {{on the road}} becoming more desirable, traffic began to increase on Park Lane during the 19th century. A short section of the lane was widened in 1851 {{as part of the}} redevelopment work on Marble Arch. In July 1866, following the destruction of the boundary railings after a demonstration supporting the Second Reform Bill, the road was widened as far as Stanhope Gate. In 1871, Hamilton Place was widened to allow an alternative traffic <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> Piccadilly.|$|E
5|$|Patent ductus arteriosus {{also appears}} in the breed. It is a {{condition}} where a small blood vessel connecting two major arteries does not close following birth.

The evolving determinants of these trends in FDI flows (the principal category of private <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> low-income countries) and other capital flows are analysed. The behaviour of <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> emerging economies heavily influences both present and potential future <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> low-income countries.

5|$|Risk factors {{indicating}} {{an increased}} risk of death include older age, female gender, a history of liver cirrhosis, biliary narrowing due to cancer, acute renal failure and the presence of liver abscesses. Complications following severe cholangitis include renal failure, respiratory failure (inability of the respiratory system to oxygenate blood and/or eliminate carbon dioxide), cardiac arrhythmia, wound infection, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding and myocardial ischemia (lack of blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> the heart, leading to heart attacks).|$|E
5|$|Several {{relatively}} young obvious lava flows {{exist in the}} area around Adams. Most of these flows are {{on the north side of}} the mountain and include the flow in the Mutton Creek area, Devils Garden, the Takh Takh Meadows Flow, and the much larger Muddy Fork Lava <b>Flow</b> <b>to</b> the north of Devils Garden. Only one obvious flow appears on the south slopes of Adams, the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Other smaller flows exist in various locations around the mountain as well.|$|E
5|$|Since 1750, the Columbia has {{experienced}} six multi-year droughts. The longest, lasting 12years in the mid‑19th century, reduced the river's <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> 20percent below average. Scientists {{have expressed concern}} that a similar drought would have grave consequences in a region so dependent on the Columbia. In 1992–1993, a lesser drought affected farmers, hydroelectric power producers, shippers, and wildlife managers.|$|E

5|$|The host {{controller}} directs traffic <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> devices, so no USB device {{can transfer}} any {{data on the}} bus without an explicit request from the host controller.

5|$|The {{location}} of Nemausus (Nîmes) was somewhat inconvenient {{when it came}} to providing a water supply. Plains lie to the city's south and east, where any sources of water would be at too low an altitude to be able to <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> the city, while the hills to the west made a water supply route too difficult from an engineering point of view. The only real alternative was to look to the north and in particular to the area around Ucetia (Uzès), where there are natural springs.|$|E
