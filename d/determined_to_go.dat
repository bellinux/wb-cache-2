She stated that they had no scepticism about CCS technology, with a competition having been started between the big energy companies to create a viable form of the technology, set to end in 2014. However this meant the station may not have been completed until 2020.|$|E

Undeterred, Chapman kept faith with his side and launched a bid for the 1932–33 title. However, it was during this season that Arsenal suffered one of the most infamous defeats in their history.|$|E

25|$|Galileo soon heard {{reports that}} Lorini had {{obtained}} {{a copy of}} his letter to Castelli and was claiming that it contained many heresies. He also heard that Caccini had gone to Rome and suspected him of trying to stir up trouble with Lorini's copy of the letter. As 1615 wore on he became more concerned, and eventually <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Rome as soon as his health permitted, which it did {{at the end of the}} year. By presenting his case there, he hoped to clear his name of any suspicion of heresy, and to persuade the Church authorities not to suppress heliocentric ideas.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February, Napoleon maneuvered Prussia into {{agreeing to}} {{transfer}} {{several of her}} territories to France and France's allies in return for Hanover, which France had previously occupied. France invaded the Kingdom of Naples on 8 February 1806 and the last foothold on the Italian peninsula fell to the conquerors on 23 July. On 25 July, Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a French satellite in Germany. In {{the face of these}} French aggressions, the pro-war faction at the Prussian court, centered around Queen Louise, soon gained the upper hand. The pacific Haugwitz was dismissed as chief minister and on 7 August 1806 King Frederick William <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to war against Napoleon.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin {{was also}} experimenting with the {{cathode ray tube}} to create and show images. While working for Westinghouse Electric in 1923, he began to develop an {{electronic}} camera tube. But in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low contrast and poor definition, and was stationary. Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. But RCA, which acquired the Westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for Farnsworth's 1927 image dissector was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic imaging device. Thus RCA, {{on the basis of}} Zworykin's 1923 patent application, filed a patent interference suit against Farnsworth. The U.S. Patent Office examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin. Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin's 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application, he also divided his original application in 1931. Zworykin was unable or unwilling to introduce evidence of a working model of his tube that was based on his 1923 patent application. In September 1939, after losing an appeal in the courts and <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> forward with the commercial manufacturing of television equipment, RCA agreed to pay Farnsworth US$1 million over a ten-year period, in addition to license payments, to use Farnsworth's patents.|$|E

500|$|Chaplin {{spent two}} years {{developing}} the script, and began filming in September 1939 – six days after Britain declared war on Germany. He had submitted to using spoken dialogue, partly out of acceptance {{that he had no}} other choice, but also because he recognised it as a better method for delivering a political message. Making a comedy about Hitler was seen as highly controversial, but Chaplin's financial independence allowed him to take the risk. [...] "I was <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> ahead," [...] he later wrote, [...] "for Hitler must be laughed at." [...] Chaplin replaced the Tramp (while wearing similar attire) with [...] "A Jewish Barber", a reference to the Nazi party's belief that he was Jewish.

500|$|Conroy {{began his}} career with Home Farm, where he won four Irish youth caps. He played for the Home Farm under-13s {{at the age of}} ten, at a time when Home Farm were {{considered}} the best youth team in the country.

However he was frequently told that he was too short to be taken on as an apprentice by an English club. However a late growth spurt saw him grow an extra six inches to reach the height of [...] at age 17. By this time he also began playing for the Home Farm senior team in the League of Ireland B Division.|$|E
500|$|Viewers saw {{the slow}} {{build-up}} to Pauline's climactic exit throughout {{the latter part}} of 2006. The character's bitter decline involves depression, pretending to have a brain tumour to scupper the revived relationship between her son Martin and his ex-wife Sonia, marital breakdown, and finally ostracism after Martin and the rest of Albert Square discover her lie. Having successfully alienated everyone around her, Pauline plans to go to America to join her daughter. Wendy Richard commented on the reasons behind Pauline's actions: [...] "she cannot forgive. For anyone to hurt a member of her family so badly is incomprehensible to Pauline. She is a good, but unforgiving woman. Sonia {{is more than just a}} thorn in Pauline's side. She is angry because she feels Martin has let her down in returning to Sonia. She feels he could have discussed it with her more and talked her round for the sake of Rebecca. Pauline will blame her decision to leave on Sonia—another way of punishing Martin. Even though she is really hurting over leaving Rebecca, Pauline is <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> She realised she never really loved Joe, he has lied to her too many times... Although I know Pauline better than anyone, even I cannot fathom out why she made up the brain tumour story." ...|$|E

He left the university in March 1827 and the already-strained relationship with his foster father, John Allan, grew worse. Poe <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Boston, where he was born. When Poe's biological mother Eliza Poe died, the only object she left him was a watercolor painting of the city, {{on the back of}} which she had written, [...] "For my little son Edgar, who should ever love Boston, the place of his birth, and where his mother found her best and most sympathetic friends." [...] John Allan, a merchant in Richmond, Virginia, refused to give his foster son the $12 for the trip, though it is likely Poe got the money from his foster mother Frances Allan. John Allan was not aware of Poe's decision or whereabouts and, not concerned, wrote [...] "I'm thinking Edgar has gone to Sea to seek his own fortunes". After arriving in Boston in April 1827, Poe served briefly as clerk for a wholesale merchandise warehouse on the waterfront, then as an office clerk and reporter for an obscure newspaper, the Weekly Report. After several weeks, in desperation, he enlisted in the United States Army for a five-year term under the pseudonym [...] "Edgar A. Perry"; he gave his age as 22, though he was only 18, likely because he would have needed parental consent if under 21. He was assigned to the First Regiment of Artillery and stationed at Boston Harbor's Fort Independence.|$|E
