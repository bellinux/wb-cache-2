5|$|Dactyl {{may have}} {{originated}} {{at the same}} time as Ida, from the disruption of the Koronis parent body. However, it may have formed more recently, perhaps as ejecta from a large impact on Ida. It is extremely unlikely that it was captured by Ida. Dactyl may <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>a</b> major impact around 100 million years ago, which reduced its size.|$|E
5|$|For Greece {{is already}} entirely obedient to you, {{and will remain}} so: the Achaeans from genuine affection; the Aetolians from the terror which their {{disasters}} in the present war have inspired them. Italy, and your crossing into it, {{is the first step}} in the acquirement of universal empire, to which no one has a better claim than yourself. And now is the moment to act when the Romans <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>a</b> reverse.|$|E
5|$|Oxbow's second-place {{finish in}} the Belmont Stakes in June made him the third horse that year to reach $1million in purse wins. Following the Belmont, he was ranked the top three-year-old racehorse in the United States by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA). He was pulled up shortly after {{finishing}} fourth in the Haskell Invitational, and was found to <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>a</b> soft tissue injury, {{was taken out of}} competition for the remainder of his three-year-old season, and retired in October 2013. He stands at stud for the 2015 breeding season at Calumet Farms.|$|E

5|$|Son of Beast is {{also known}} for two major, non-fatal accidents. In 2006, damage to the track caused one of the trains to stop abruptly. Another setback {{occurred}} in 2009, when a woman claimed to <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>a</b> head injury. The ride was closed indefinitely, with the only reference of its existence appearing on a tombstone outside the new Banshee coaster (showing a simple logo of the ride and the dates 2000-2009). On July 27, 2012, the closure was made permanent, as Kings Island announced that the roller coaster would be dismantled and removed from the park.|$|E
5|$|The boys ran to {{town for}} help, and several men, {{including}} local businessman Watson Stanley Fisher, 24, came to investigate. Fisher and others dived into the creek to find Stilwell, believing him to <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>a</b> seizure. After locating the boy's body {{and attempting to}} return to shore, Fisher was also bitten by the shark {{in front of the}} townspeople, losing Stilwell in the process. His right thigh was severely injured and he bled to death at Monmouth Memorial Hospital in Long Branch at 5:30p.m. Stilwell's body was recovered 150feet (46m) upstream from the Wyckoff dock on July 14.|$|E
5|$|The {{captured}} wildling Osha, now {{a servant}} of the Starks, is harassed by Theon Greyjoy, who warns {{her that if she}} had been arrested in his homeland the Iron Islands, she would <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>a</b> worse fate. As Maester Luwin tells Theon to leave her alone after witnessing Theon's sexual advance on her, he asks Osha why she and other wildlings are coming south from the Wall. She reveals they were fleeing from the White Walkers, who have apparently returned after millennia of slumber, and declares that every army in the Seven Kingdoms should be marching north to confront that threat.|$|E

5|$|Although his Test {{career had}} finished, Loxton {{continued}} to play for his state. He had another disappointing season with the bat in 1951–52, scoring only 322 runs at 24.76 in nine matches. After winning the opening match of the season against Western Australia, he did not taste victory again until the final fixture of the summer against South Australia, in which he scored 71—his only fifty of the season—and took a total of 4/37 in an innings victory. Victoria lost three times and would <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>a</b> fourth defeat but for Loxton’s unbeaten 41 against Queensland, which helped them to hold on for a draw with one wicket intact. He continued to take regular wickets, ending with 21 scalps at 31.00 for the season, including an innings best of 4/56, but he managed a total of only 4/249 against New South Wales, {{who went on to}} win the competition.|$|E
5|$|During Manchester United's 2–1 {{win against}} Arsenal on 22 January, Nani {{sustained}} a foot injury from a tackle by Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny in the 75th minute {{and was replaced}} by Ashley Young. After a scan on Nani's foot, he was feared to <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>a</b> metatarsal injury, thus not being able to play for two months. Nani returned to football on 15 April at United's match against Aston Villa as a substitute, replacing Young on the left wing. He scored a goal in stoppage time (93rd minute) with a low shot past Villa goalkeeper Shay Given from Jonny Evans' through-ball assist, resulting in a 4–0 win over Villa. Nani then followed this with another goal when chipping Tim Howard at his near post in a 4–4 draw at Old Trafford against Everton.|$|E
5|$|On 14 November 2007, it was {{announced}} that former EastEnders scriptwriter Tony Jordan had been contacted by Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke with an idea for an episode and that Jordan had returned to EastEnders having written the script for the episode. The single-hander episode {{was announced}} the next day, the first episode of any soap opera to feature just one character. Jordan had wanted to write a solo episode for EastEnders – well known for its two-hander episodes – for some time, but the opportunity had never arisen until Bardon had a stroke in real life, which was reflected in storyines when Jim was said to <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>a</b> stroke when visiting relatives off screen. Cast and crew were grateful for the opportunity to make the episode but were aware it had come about due to the suffering of somebody they loved. Brown was initially sceptical that her character could carry an entire episode by herself, but stated that Dot has a lot of history so there was a lot to call upon.|$|E

5|$|Two Barcelona players {{missed the}} final through suspension: right back Dani Alves, who {{picked up his}} third yellow card of the tournament in Barcelona's semi-final second leg against Chelsea on 6 May 2009; and left back Éric Abidal, who was sent off in the same game for a {{professional}} foul on Nicolas Anelka. Defender Rafael Márquez also missed the match after {{he picked up a}} knee injury in the first leg of the semi-final, ruling him out {{for the rest of the}} season. Forward Thierry Henry and semi-final-winning midfielder Andrés Iniesta were also doubts for the final; Henry damaged his right posterior cruciate ligament in Barcelona's 6–2 league win over Real Madrid on 2 May 2009, while Iniesta was discovered to <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> <b>a</b> tear in his right thigh following Barça's 3–3 draw with Villarreal on 10 May. Both Henry and Iniesta returned to light training on 22 May, but they had not yet resumed training with the main squad and remained doubts for the final. Carles Puyol, however, was available for selection after he served a one-match suspension in the semi-final second leg. In all, FC Barcelona started with seven players who had come up through the youth system, of whom five were Catalans.|$|E
