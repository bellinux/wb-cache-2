50|$|Many amateurs {{have found}} the 33 {{centimeter}} band to be ideal for <b>linking</b> <b>repeaters</b> together. Some of the biggest <b>linked</b> <b>repeater</b> systems in the United States use the 33 centimeter band as their link backbone.|$|R
50|$|<b>Repeaters</b> may be <b>linked</b> {{together}} {{in order to}} form {{what is known as}} a <b>linked</b> <b>repeater</b> system or <b>linked</b> <b>repeater</b> network. In such a system, when one repeater is keyed-up by receiving a signal, all the other repeaters in the network are also activated and will transmit the same signal. The connections between the repeaters are made via radio (usually on a different frequency from the published transmitting frequency) for maximum reliability. Some networks have a feature to allow the user being able to turn additional <b>repeaters</b> and <b>links</b> on or off on the network. This feature is typically done with DTMF tones to control the network infrastructure. Such a system allows coverage over a wide area, enabling communication between amateurs often hundreds of miles (several hundred km) apart. These systems are used for area or regional communications, for example in Skywarn nets, where storm spotters relay severe weather reports. All the user has to know is which channel to use in which area.|$|R

A {{key problem}} in {{establishing}} and maintaining high quality communication <b>repeater</b> <b>links</b> among users, where {{the vehicle for}} retransmission is a synchronous orbit communications satellite, is that of enhancing the limited effective radiated power (ERP) capabilities of the smaller user against the not always so limited ERP capabilities of co-users or other sources of rf interference.

40|$|We {{propose a}} repeat-until-success {{protocol}} {{to improve the}} performance of probabilistic quantum repeaters. Conventionally, these rely on passive static linear-optics elements and photodetectors to perform Bell-state measurements (BSMs) with a maximum success rate of 50 %. This is a strong impediment for entanglement swapping between distant quantum memories. Every time a BSM fails, entanglement needs to be redistributed between the corresponding memories in the <b>repeater</b> <b>link.</b> The key ingredients of our scheme are repeatable BSMs. Under ideal conditions, these turn probabilistic quantum repeaters into deterministic ones. Under realistic conditions, our protocol too might fail. However, using additional threshold detectors now allows us to improve the entanglement generation rate by almost orders of magnitude, at a nominal distance of 1000 km, compared to schemes that rely on conventional BSMs. This improvement is sufficient to make the performance of our scheme comparable to the expected performance of some deterministic quantum repeaters...|$|R

To date, effects on the system have been essentially undetectable. Measurements of television signal strengths were taken at an existing television remote pickup and relay station at the WTS site. Potential TV signal interference problems from the WTSs have been avoided by replacing the remote pickups with microwave <b>repeater</b> <b>links</b> for the four TV channels received from Portland, Oregon.

40|$|We {{propose a}} repeat-until-success {{protocol}} {{to improve the}} performance of probabilistic quantum repeaters. Quantum repeaters rely on passive static linear optics elements and photodetectors to perform Bell-state measurements (BSMs). Conventionally, the success rate of these BSMs cannot exceed 50 %, which is an impediment for entanglement swapping between distant quantum memories. Every time that a BSM fails, entanglement needs to be re-distributed between the corresponding memories in the <b>repeater</b> <b>link.</b> The key ingredient in our scheme is a repeatable BSM. Although it too relies only on linear optics and photo-detection, it ideally allows us to repeat every BSM until it succeeds. This, in principle, can turn a probabilistic quantum repeater into a deterministic one. Under realistic conditions, where our measurement devices are lossy, our repeatable BSMs may also fail. However, we show that by using additional threshold detectors, we can improve the entanglement generation rate between one and two orders of magnitude {{as compared to the}} probabilistic repeater systems that rely on conventional BSMs. This improvement is sufficient to make the performance of probabilistic quantum repeaters comparable with some of existing proposals for deterministic quantum repeaters.

40|$|As {{technology}} scales, SoCs {{are increasing}} in core counts, {{leading to the}} need for scalable NoCs to interconnect the multiple cores on the chip. Given aggressive SoC design targets, NoCs have to deliver low latency, high bandwidth, at low power and area overheads. In this paper, we propose Single-cycle Multi-hop Asynchronous Repeated Traversal (SMART) NoC, a NoC that reconfigures and tailors a generic mesh topology for SoC applications at runtime. The heart of our SMART NoC is a novel low-swing clockless repeated link circuit embedded within the router crossbars, that allows packets to potentially bypass all the way from source to destination core within a single clock cycle, without being latched at any intermediate router. Our clockless <b>repeater</b> <b>link</b> has been proven in silicon in 45 nm SOI. Results show that at 2 GHz, we can traverse 8 mm within a single cycle, i. e. 8 hops with 1 mm cores. We implement the SMART NoC to layout and show that SMART NoC gives 60 % latency savings, and 2. 2 X power savings compared to a baseline mesh NoC. United States.

50|$|In {{the middle}} of the 1980s the former {{telecommunication}} office at of Rottweil installed two directional antennas on Lember Tower for the realization of a passive <b>repeater</b> microwave <b>link</b> between the communications building in Rottweil and the trunk exchange, situated at station road in Gosheim. This microwave link, which {{would not have been possible}} on direct way, served as addition to the existing telephone interwirings. After these were replaced by optical waveguide cables, this microwave link became ever more dispensable and in the year 2005 these antennas were dismantled.|$|R

50|$|In amateur radio, {{repeaters}} {{are typically}} maintained by individual hobbyists or local groups of amateur radio operators. Many repeaters are provided openly to other amateur radio operators and typically not {{used as a}} remote base station by a single user or group. In some areas multiple <b>repeaters</b> are <b>linked</b> {{together to form a}} wide-coverage network, such as the linked system provided by the Independent Repeater Association which covers most of western Michigan, or the Western Intertie Network System ("WINsystem") that now covers a great deal of California, and is in 17 other states, including Hawaii, along with parts of four other countries, Australia, Canada, Great Britain and Japan.|$|R

30|$|Seismograms of shallow (depth < 95 km) {{earthquakes}} with magnitudes of 2.5 {{or larger}} {{are used in}} the analysis. The sampling frequency is 100 Hz and most of the seismometers are 1 Hz velocity-type instruments. The coherence of the waveforms for all event pairs with epicentral separations of less than 30 km are calculated. The time windows for seismogram analysis are set at 0 – 40 s from the P-wave arrival times. Two earthquakes are considered to represent a repeating pair if the average coherence at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 Hz is larger than 0.95 at two or more stations.

5000|$|The old TRM <b>repeater</b> network, still <b>linked</b> {{to channel}} 22, was shifted to rebroadcast channel 7, whose {{programming}} was geared toward a working-class audience {{in contrast to}} that of channel 13.

40|$|In {{order to}} provide for the safe {{integration}} of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS), the control and non-payload communications (CNPC) link must be highly reliable. A specific requirement is that it must operate using aviation safety radiofrequency spectrum. Two types of links are required - line-of-sight (LOS) using terrestrial-based communications and beyond-line- of-sight (BLOS) using satellite communications. The 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC- 12) provided a suitable allocation for LOS CNPC spectrum in the 5030 - 5091 MHz band which, when combined with a previously existing allocation fulfills the LOS spectrum requirement. The 5030 - 5091 MHz band is also allocated for BLOS CNPC, but since a significant portion of that band is required for LOS CNPC, additional BLOS spectrum is required. More critically, there are no satellites in operation or in development to provide such services in that band. Hence BLOS CNPC cannot be provided in protected aviation spectrum under current conditions. To fill this gap and enable integration of UAS into the NAS, it has been proposed to allow CNPC to operate over certain Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) bands in which many satellites currently provide commercial services. To enable this, changes in international regulation must be enacted. Agenda Item 1. 5 of the 2015 WRC examines the possible regulatory changes needed. As part of the examination process, sharing between potential UAS using satellite communications for BLOS CNPC and other services allocated to the FSS bands being considered must be studied. This paper reviews the technical requirements and approach being undertaken for these sharing studies, with emphasis on study of interference from UAS into digital <b>repeater</b> <b>links</b> operating under the Fixed Service allocation. These studies are being conducted by NASA Glenn Research Center...|$|R

Operation of such control links in the crowded 2-meter band is problematic and on many frequencies in that band expressly prohibited, leaving 1.25-meter band frequencies as the lowest available for remote control of repeaters and unattended stations.|$|R

50|$|Microwave {{transmission}} is {{the transmission of}} information or energy by microwave radio waves. Although an experimental 64 km (40 mile) microwave telecommunication link across the English Channel was demonstrated in 1931, the development of radar in World War II provided the technology for practical exploitation of microwave communication. In the 1950s, large transcontinental microwave relay networks, consisting of chains of <b>repeater</b> stations <b>linked</b> by line-of-sight beams of microwaves were built in Europe and America to relay long distance telephone traffic and television programs between cities. Communication satellites which transferred data between ground stations by microwaves took over much long distance traffic in the 1960s.

40|$|To date, {{research}} on entangled quantum networks has primarily focused on an abstract model {{consisting of a}} linear chain of repeaters, with a power of two number of hops of identical length and quality. We are analyzing the behavior of more complex network topologies. In a network of heterogeneous links and irregular topology, path selection affects both the performance of individual connection and global network load. We propose a definition for link cost and an algorithm for ranking candidate paths to maximize the throughput of end-to-end connections, measured in high-fidelity Bell pairs per second. Simulations confirm reasonable agreement between the calculated path cost and the expected throughput. Thus, we propose {{the use of a}} quantum form of Dijkstra’s algorithm[1]. Problem Networks of quantum repeaters use purification and entanglement swapping to create high-fidelity end-to-end Bell pairs which are then used in distributed quan-tum applications. For homogeneous paths of 2 n hops quantum repeaters operate well using a simple dou-bling of distance for each entanglement swap. In real-world networks, candidate paths will have differing numbers of hops of varying quality. On such hetero-geneous paths, we must reconsider when and where entanglement swapping takes place, and devise an al-gorithm for ranking paths. Approach We wish to define a cost for each path, allowing us to order a set of paths so that low-cost paths better meet out goals for the overall system. Here, we choose max-imizing throughput as our goal, meaning that high-bandwidth paths (measured in high-fidelity Bell pairs per second) will have a low cost. To achieve this, we need both a way to establish the cost for a single link, and a way to calculate path cost from a set of link costs. We use the inverse of single-hop throughput as our link cost. Path cost, as in Dijkstra’s algorithm, is the sum of the link costs in the path. We have extended our quantum network simulator to calculate the through-put of end-to-end connections for heterogeneous links. Non-power of two lengths and path-adapted entangle-ment swapping remain as future work. We expect to use both static and dynamically adaptive methods. Results In our simulation, we used three types of qubus-based <b>repeater</b> <b>links</b> (see [2] and references therein) ...|$|R
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the short-lived but popular Televisión Independiente de México (1968-72), which TSM absorbed in 1973 to form Televisa, the latter saw no major commercial competition until 1993. Instead, the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s were marked by a large expansion in state-owned television. This took flight in 1972 when the government, through financier SOMEX, expropriated XHDF-TV in Mexico City and used it to form the base of a Canal 13 national network with repeaters across the country. At the same time, a project known as Televisión Rural de México (later Televisión de la República Mexicana) sought to bring culture and information to rural Mexican audiences. In the 1980s, XHTRM-TV channel 22, the first UHF television station in the Valle de México, came to air bringing TRM programming to the nation's capital. In 1985, TRM was dismantled, and with the sign-on of XHIMT-TV channel 7 in Mexico City, the TRM <b>repeaters</b> were <b>linked</b> to that station, which became the flagship of the Red Nacional 7 of Imevisión.
