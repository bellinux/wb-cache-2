Case studies {{have been used to}} provide an insight into the practical issues associated with the assessment of marine ecosystem <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> services at specific locations. The aim of this research was to validate the definitions of <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> services, and to identify knowledge gaps and likely difficulties of quantifying the <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> services. A validated theoretical framework for the assessment of <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> services is detailed, and examples of the <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> services at a variety of case study areas are documented. These results will enable future assessments of marine ecosystem <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> services. It is concluded that the utilisation of this <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> services approach has the capacity to play a fundamental role in the Ecosystem Approach, by enabling the pressures and demands of society, the economy and the environment to be integrated into environmental management...|$|R

50|$|Because it {{has been}} {{adjusted}} to account {{for changes in the}} prices of <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> services, real wages provide a clearer representation of an individual's wages {{in terms of what they}} can afford to buy with those wages - specifically, in terms of the amount of <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> services that can be bought. However, real wages suffer the disadvantage of not being well defined, since the amount of inflation (which can be calculated based on different combinations of <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> services) is itself not well defined. Hence real wage defined as the total amount of <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> services that can be bought with a wage, is also not defined. This is because changes in the relative prices of <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> services will change the financial comparability of various bundles of <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> services.|$|R
