5|$|Fish species {{diversity}} is roughly divided equally between marine (oceanic) and freshwater ecosystems. Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific constitute {{the center of}} diversity <b>for</b> <b>marine</b> fishes, whereas continental freshwater fishes are most diverse in large river basins of tropical rainforests, especially the Amazon, Congo, and Mekong basins. More than 5,600 fish species inhabit Neotropical freshwaters alone, such that Neotropical fishes represent about 10% of all vertebrate species on the Earth. Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin, such as Cantão State Park, can contain more freshwater fish species than occur in all of Europe.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about West Alseks {{subsequent}} civilian career until early 1929. In February of that year, West Alsek, still under USSB ownership, was selected for the addition of pulverized coal-fired boilers for testing purposes. Coal pulverizers would take coal—often cheaper, inferior grades normally unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>marine</b> use—and grind them into coal dust. This dust would then be mixed with air and automatically injected into the boilers {{without the need for}} hand-feeding. West Alsek entered the Todd Brooklyn shipyard to undergo the conversion in late February.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature {{currently}} {{assesses the}} orca's conservation status as data deficient {{because of the}} likelihood that two or more killer whale types are separate species. Some local populations are considered threatened or endangered due to prey depletion, habitat loss, pollution (by PCBs), capture <b>for</b> <b>marine</b> mammal parks, and conflicts with human fisheries. In late 2005, the Southern Resident Killer Whales, the population that inhabits British Columbia and Washington state waters, {{were placed on the}} U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E

5|$|In 1953 the State Department's {{physical}} security was split between {{foreign and domestic}} branches. Uanna reorganized these into one group called the Division of Physical Security, consisting of four branches, and took over as its new chief. He then published the Protection of Dignitaries Manual and developed the handbook used at the training school <b>for</b> <b>Marine</b> Security Guards assigned to U. S. embassies, legations and consulates overseas. As Chief of the Division, Uanna {{was responsible for the}} security of all State's personnel and facilities in the United States and abroad.

5|$|In June 1995, then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong asked PA {{to study}} {{the idea of having}} {{community}} centres share their premises with other civil users such as libraries, government offices and commercial developments.

In June 1996, Wong Kan Seng, PA's deputy chairman, announced that due to the scarcity of land in Singapore, eight of the redeveloped community centres, including Marine Parade Community Club, would be located with other civil users.|$|E

5|$|Like other caprellids, C. mutica are preyed upon {{predominantly}} by {{fish and}} crabs. In their native habitats, the predators of Caprellamutica include the shore crab Carcinus maenas and the goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris) which consume them in large numbers. Other predators include nudibranchs, starfish, nemertean worms, sea anemones, and hydrozoans. They constitute a valuable food source for these organisms {{due to their}} high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids and carotenoids. They also provide an important link in the food chain between plankton and larger fish. This, {{in addition to their}} relative abundance and fast growth rates, make them a potentially important resource <b>for</b> <b>marine</b> fish feed in aquaculture. Introduced populations of C.mutica have become {{a major part of the}} diets of native wild and farmed fish.|$|E
5|$|Logging, {{along with}} {{cultivation}} practices has devastated tree cover, causing severe environmental degradation in the country. Over 80percent of Sarawak's rainforest has been cleared. Floods in East Malaysia have been worsened {{by the loss}} of trees, and over 60percent of the Peninsular's forest have been cleared. With current rates of deforestation, the forests are predicted to be extinct by 2020. Deforestation is a major problem for animals, fungi and plants, as the forest is cut to make room for plantations. Most remaining forest is found inside national parks. Habitat destruction has proved a threat <b>for</b> <b>marine</b> life. Illegal fishing is another major threat, with fishing methods such as dynamite fishing and poisoning depleting marine ecosystems. Leatherback turtle numbers have dropped 98percent since the 1950s. Hunting has also been an issue for some animals, with overconsumption and the use of animal parts for profit endangering many animals, from marine life to tigers. Marine life is also detrimentally affected by uncontrolled tourism.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{are widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the globe, but their distribution is patchy and coincides with the productivity of the oceans. Species richness peaks at around 40° latitude, both north and south. This corresponds to {{the highest levels of}} primary production around North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. Total species range is highly variable <b>for</b> <b>marine</b> mammal species. On average most marine mammals have ranges which are equivalent or smaller than one-fifth of the Indian Ocean. The variation observed in range size {{is a result of the}} different ecological requirements of each species and their ability to cope with a broad range of environmental conditions. The high degree of overlap between marine mammal species richness and areas of human impact on the environment is of concern.|$|E

5|$|Most oil {{pollution}} in the sea comes from cities and industry. Oil is dangerous <b>for</b> <b>marine</b> animals. It can clog the feathers of sea birds, reducing their insulating effect and the birds' buoyancy, or be ingested when they preen themselves {{in an attempt to}} remove the contaminant. Marine mammals are less seriously affected but may be chilled through the removal of their insulation, blinded, dehydrated, or poisoned. Benthic invertebrates are swamped when the oil sinks, fish are poisoned, and the food chain is disrupted. In the short term, oil spills result in wildlife populations being decreased and unbalanced, leisure activities being affected, and the livelihoods of people dependent on the sea being devastated. The marine environment has self-cleansing properties and naturally occurring bacteria will act over time to remove oil from the sea. In the Gulf of Mexico, where oil-eating bacteria are already present, they take only a few days to consume spilt oil.|$|E
5|$|Much {{of what he}} did in the Senate can be {{described}} as the typical sponsorship of legislation that would benefit his state. With his sponsorship, the Senate passed a bill that would aid railroads in Florida, and another that would sell off some of the live oak reservations maintained by the Federal government for the Navy; both bills failed in the House of Representatives. He was more successful with bills aimed at prosecuting the ongoing campaign against the Seminole Indians, although the problem seems to have been overstated. His bills would provide compensation for persons who had suffered from the depredations of Indian raids, and would further the process of removing the aborigines from the state. He also introduced bills that provided <b>for</b> <b>marine</b> hospitals in port cities in Florida. None of this would have been considered exceptional for the era.|$|E
5|$|Noise {{pollution}} from anthropogenic activities is another major concern <b>for</b> <b>marine</b> mammals. This {{is a problem}} because underwater noise pollution interferes with the abilities of some marine mammals to communicate, and locate both predators and prey. Underwater explosions are used {{for a variety of}} purposes including military activities, construction and oceanographic or geophysical research. They can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. Underwater noise is generated from shipping, the oil and gas industry, research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation. Acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit loud and noxious underwater sounds.|$|E
