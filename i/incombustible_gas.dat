40|$|The {{effect of}} basic {{magnesium}} carbonate (BMC), magnesium hydroxide (MH), and magnesium chloride hydrate (MCH) on thermal degradation of red gum wood was studied using cone calorimetry, Thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) analysis, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization. The results showed common fire retardation {{actions of the}} three compounds by releasing <b>incombustible</b> <b>gas</b> and/or water vapor to dilute combustible gas in the flaming zone, and by converting to MgO, which had a satisfactory protective wall effect on the wood. Individually, BMC absorbed heat from the wood at the pre-decomposition stage and, thus, slowed down wood pyrolysis process. It slightly increased the char yield by charring in both the charring stage and the char calcination stage. MH lost water at about 270 °C, close to the temperature at which wood thermally degraded. MH rendered wood char quickly, and the compact char layer impeded further carbonization and burning of inner wood. MCH promoted charring with Mg 2 + as a Lewis acid, and increased wood char yield. MCH also released Cl· free radical and HCl at 167 °C, which easily coordinated with combustion reaction radical, and slowed down, even inhibited, the combustion chain reaction...|$|E

5000|$|Some {{industries}} exclude oxygen from dust-raising processes, {{a precaution}} known as [...] "inerting". Typically this uses nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or argon, which are <b>incombustible</b> <b>gases</b> which can displace oxygen. The same method {{is also used}} in large storage tanks where flammable vapors can accumulate. However, use of oxygen-free gases brings a risk of asphyxiation of the workers. Workers who need illumination in enclosed spaces where a dust explosion is a high risk often use lamps designed for underwater divers, as they have no risk of producing an open spark due to their sealed waterproof design.|$|R
50|$|A {{mud volcano}} {{may be the}} result of a piercement {{structure}} created by a pressurized mud diapir that breaches the Earth's surface or ocean bottom. Their temperatures may be as low as the freezing point of the ejected materials, particularly when venting is associated with the creation of hydrocarbon clathrate hydrate deposits. Mud volcanoes are often associated with petroleum deposits and tectonic subduction zones and orogenic belts; hydrocarbon gases are often erupted. They are also often associated with lava volcanoes; in the case of such close proximity, mud volcanoes emit <b>incombustible</b> <b>gases</b> including helium, whereas lone mud volcanoes are more likely to emit methane.|$|R
5000|$|PCB's utility {{was based}} largely on their {{chemical}} stability, including low flammability, and high dielectric constant. In an electric arc, PCBs generate <b>incombustible</b> <b>gases.</b> Use of PCBs is commonly divided into closed and open applications. Examples of closed applications include coolants and insulating fluids (transformer oil) for transformers and capacitors, such as those used in old fluorescent light ballasts, hydraulic fluids, lubricating and cutting oils, etc. In contrast, the major open application of PCBs was in carbonless copy ("NCR") paper, which even nowadays results in paper contamination. Other open applications were as plasticizers in paints and cements, stabilizing additives in flexible PVC coatings of electrical cables and electronic components, pesticide extenders, reactive flame retardants and sealants for caulking, adhesives, wood floor finishes, such as Fabulon and other products of Halowax in the U.S., de-dusting agents, waterproofing compounds, casting agents. It was also used as a plasticizer in paints and especially [...] "coal tars" [...] that were used widely to coat water tanks, bridges and other infrastructure pieces.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Biogas {{is widely}} used in villages of Nepal for cooking and lighting. But its {{commercial}} use has never been realized due to difficulties in its storage and transportation. Solution identified to the problem {{is to increase the}} energy density of the gas through removal of <b>incombustible</b> and corrosive <b>gas</b> and consequent compression which was experimented on a lab-scale model. This paper presents all the results of removal of CO 2 gas from biogas using different chemicals and relative purity with raw gas. Further, compression of biogas and was carried out by methane refrigerant compressor and bottled into normal LPG cylinder. Compression of biogas was carried out under near Isothermal and Adiabatic conditions up to 11 bar absolute pressure. The energy efficiency of compression was determined to be 98. 71 % and if the gas used for generation of electricity using a generator with an efficiency of 30 %, the net energy efficiency turned out to be 95. 72 %. Later, a boiling test was conducted whereby the combustibility of the compressed biogas from the cylinder in normal biogas-stove was tested to validate its use in cooking, the results of which are included...|$|R
