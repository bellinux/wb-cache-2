5|$|Above {{the third}} setback, {{consisting}} of the 24th through 27th floors, the facade contains horizontal bands and zigzagged gray-and-black brick motifs. Above the fourth setback, between the 27th and 31st floors, the shaft starts to appear. At each corner of the 31st floor, large car-hood ornaments made of Nirosta steel serve as visually striking objects that make the base look larger. These corner extensions alleviate a common optical illusion seen in tall buildings with horizontal bands, whose taller floors would normally look larger. The 31st floor also contains a gray and white frieze of hubcaps and fenders, which both symbolizes the Chrysler Corporation {{and serves as a}} visual effect for the building's Art Deco design. The bonnet embellishments take the shape of Mercury's winged helmet, which was modeled after the <b>hood</b> <b>ornament</b> installed on Chrysler vehicles at the time.|$|E

25|$|The Century {{received}} a facelift for 1989, gaining a new more-rounded roofline, but continuing on the A-body platform. Black plastic inserts with the Buick trishield emblem replaced the rear quarter windows. The front end received flush headlamps and a rounded grille, and the stand-up <b>hood</b> <b>ornament</b> was now standard. All sedan models were easily distinguished by their distinctive full-width taillights, a somewhat extravagant flourish {{on a smaller}} sedan, but one that carried on a Buick tradition of big taillights. An interior refresh came in 1990.|$|E
25|$|For 1976, {{the final}} year of this generation, all Olds 88s {{received}} revised grille work, rectangular headlamps and parking lamps directly below instead of in the bumper, with Delta 88 Royale models also getting spring-loaded stand-up hood ornaments.

25|$|One AMC {{model of}} {{interest}} was a detailed promotional for the 1965 and 1966 AMC Marlin fastbacks - a dramatic new {{variation on the}} Classic. The two year's models differ in their grilles {{and the removal of}} the Rambler name on the 1966 version. A friction model was also available for the 1966 Marlin. The promos were finished in a variety of single and two-tone color combinations according to factory available hues. One common color was light turquoise molded plastic with roof and rear fastback deck colored AMC metallic blue-green. As the 1966 model year neared its end and all-new cars for 1967 were being introduced, AMC dealers contributed thousands of leftover Marlin promos to institutions such as children's hospitals and orphanages. The 1966 promos are now desirable and they command premium prices. Value for an individual model can be $200 to $400 for mint, in-the-box specimens with <b>hood</b> <b>ornament</b> intact.|$|E
25|$|The {{hatchback}} {{was dropped}} for 1980, {{as was the}} old three-speed manual transmission. Remaining Concord models were given a smoother appearance. The sedan versions of the D/L and Limited were given full vinyl roofs with nearly triangular opera windows embedded in the C-pillars; the coupe versions received squared off opera windows, and revised chrome opera window trim with vertical strakes occupying {{the space between the}} window itself and the outer piece of trim. Limited wagons received blackout paint and chrome trim surrounding their rear quarter windows. Base sedans and coupes retained the same rooflines and treatment seen on Hornets since 1970. Taillights were modified and given a wraparound treatment reminiscent of the old Hornet. All Concords received a new horizontal bar grille, with the Concord name in script to the driver's side, and a new, squared-off <b>hood</b> <b>ornament</b> bearing the AMC tri-color logo. That same year, options such as power windows and power seats were also made available.|$|E
25|$|The 1977 Chevelles got new grilles. The lineup {{consisted}} of Malibu and Malibu Classic models in coupe, sedan, and station wagon body styles. Estate Wagons and the Laguna Type S-3 were gone. Malibu Classics, again the top model, {{switched to a}} vertical grille pattern and six-section taillights but kept their twin stacked headlights and stand-up <b>hood</b> <b>ornament.</b> Malibu grilles changed little. Fewer engine selections were available though the engines that remained gained a few horses. In standard form, Chevelles had a 250-cubic-inch six-cylinder engine or a , 305-cubic-inch V8. The sole option beyond that was a , four-barrel 350-cubic-inch V8 (this engine was standard in the Malibu Classic station wagon) Malibu Classics had a luxurious cloth/vinyl split-bench front seat, color-keyed steering wheel, and woodgrain-accented instrument panel. Malibu options included a $46 Exterior Decor group, $54 tinted glass, and $33 full wheel covers.
