However, because oxidative stress is involved in both of these cellular responses, the possibility that xanthates may act as antioxidants was investigated in the current study. Finding that xanthates efficiently scavenge hydroxyl radicals, the mechanism by which D 609 and other xanthate derivatives may protect against oxidative damage was further examined. The xanthates studied, especially D 609, mimic glutathione (GSH).

40|$|Xanthate {{interaction}} with pentlandite and pyrrhotite {{has been investigated}} {{in the case of}} single and mixed minerals in the presence of Ni ions and depressants such as meta-bisulfite (MBS), diethylenetriamine (DETA) and MBS plus DETA at two pHs controlled by lime and soda ash. It was found that <b>dixanthogen</b> was the main product and the surface concentration was consistently higher on pentlandite than on pyrrhotite. Ni ions enhanced the <b>dixanthogen</b> adsorption on both minerals in the case of single minerals. Mixed mineral experiments (i. e. pentlandite and pyrrhotite together) showed that <b>dixanthogen</b> formation on penlandite was promoted while on pyrrhotite it was suppressed, interpreted as due to a galvanic interaction between minerals. The ratio of <b>dixanthogen</b> adsorption on pentlandite to pyrrhotite increased to ca 4 : 1 compared to < 2 : 1 for single minerals and this ratio was maintained in the presence of depressants; overall however, depressants reduced the <b>dixanthogen</b> adsorption on both minerals in the case of single and mixed minerals. For pentlandite in the mixed mineral case, this reduction returned <b>dixanthogen</b> adsorption to values similar to those on the single mineral in the absence of depressants. For pyrrhotite, <b>dixanthogen</b> was reduced below detectable limits. In terms of flotation, the mixture of minerals enhances <b>dixanthogen</b> formation on pentlandite at the expense of pyrrhotite. This is preserved on addition of depressants which serve to reduce the absolute <b>dixanthogen</b> adsorption on pyrrhotite perhaps below a critical level for flotation. Xanthate adsorption on both minerals is reduced when the pH is adjusted by soda ash instead of lime. The general effects of depressants otherwise were similar regardless of pH modifier. Open circuit potential measurements showed that pentlandite has a higher rest potential than pyrrhotite. In the presence of xanthate, however, the order was reversed. A mixed potential model was used to explain the effect of mineral interaction on <b>dixanthogen</b> formation. At the potential of the mixed mineral system, the anodic reaction (xanthate oxidation to <b>dixanthogen)</b> occurred preferentially on the pentlandite and the cathodic reaction (reduction of oxygen to hydroxyl ion) occurred on the pyrrhotite. A new design of spectroelectrochemical external reflectance cell has been developed for in situ analysis under controlled electrochemical conditions. Orientation and stability of xanthate adsorption products on a copper electrode was studied as a model system. Cuprous xanthate was found to be the major product over the potential range [...] 0. 5 to [...] 0. 1 V (SCE). Further increase in potential to 0. 1 V resulted in the formation of <b>dixanthogen</b> in addition to cuprous xanthate. It was also found that the characteristic <b>dixanthogen</b> bands disappeared when the potential was brought back and held at [...] 1. 0 V while the cuprous xanthate bands were enhanced. When polarized radiation was used, the appearance of the characteristic peaks of cuprous xanthate changed while that of <b>dixanthogen</b> remained the same, suggesting preferential orientation of the cuprous xanthate molecules but not of the <b>dixanthogen.</b> The probable orientation of cuprous xanthate is given. In the stability study, the <b>dixanthogen</b> disappeared while the copper xanthate peaks intensified.

40|$|The {{contamination}} of sulfur emanating from pyrrhotite in magnetite concentrates {{has been a}} problem in iron ore processing. This study utilized froth flotation to float pyrrhotite away from magnetite using collectors of xanthate and <b>dixanthogen.</b> It was found that xanthate or <b>dixanthogen</b> alone could not achieve selective separation between pyrrhotite and magnetite in flotation. A high loss of magnetite was obtained with xanthate, while a low desulfurization degree was obtained with <b>dixanthogen.</b> It was interesting that a high desulfurization ratio was achieved with little loss of magnetite when xanthate was mixed with <b>dixanthogen</b> as the collector. The synergistic effect of the mixed collector on pyrrhotite was studied by electrokinectic studies and FTIR measurements. It was found that xanthate was the anchor on pyrrhotite and determined its selectivity against magnetite, while <b>dixanthogen</b> associated with xanthate, enhancing its hydrophobicity.

40|$|Two {{kinds of}} collectors, sodium butyl {{xanthate}} and kerosene, and a depressor, sodium sulfide, {{were used in}} this research. The study applied flotation tests, pulp potential measurements, contact angle measurements, adsorption calculations, and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses to demonstrate the correlation between reagents and minerals. For xanthate collectors, the best flotation responses of chalcopyrite and molybdenite were obtained at pH = 8, and, for kerosene, these were obtained at pH = 4. The flotation of molybdenite seemed to be less influenced by xanthate than by kerosene, while that of chalcopyrite showed the opposite. The optimum concentration of sodium sulfide for separation was 0. 03 mol/L, which rejected 83 % chalcopyrite and recovered 82 % molybdenite in the single mineral flotation. Pulp potential measurements revealed that the <b>dixanthogen</b> and xanthate were decomposed and desorbed, respectively, from the mineral surface in a reducing environment. The contact angle measurement and adsorption calculation conformed to the flotation response, indicating that few functions of the xanthate and sodium sulfide on the molybdenite flotation were due to their low adsorption densities. The FTIR results further clarified that the xanthate ion was adsorbed on chalcopyrite by forming cuprous xanthate and dixanthogen; however, on molybdenite the adsorption product was only <b>dixanthogen.</b> After conditioning with sodium sulfide, the chalcopyrite surface became clean, but the molybdenite surface still retained slight peaks of <b>dixanthogen.</b> Meanwhile, the possible mechanism was expounded in this research...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} composition of plena, sphalerite and pyrite surfaces has been analysed after dry and wet grinding, and after treatment {{with water and}} aqueous solutions of potassium alkylxanthate by means of Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy. The total metal concentration in the aqueous phase has been determined by means of atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The reaction between aqueous plena slurries and ethylxanthate ions has also been studied calorimetrically. In the reaction between oxidized galena and alkylxanthate ions in aqueous solution solid lead(II) alkylxanthate is formed on the surfaces. The formation takes place via dissolution of soluble oxidation products of plena on the surface followed by the precipitation of solid lead(II) alkylxanthate. It {{has been shown that}} lead(II) alkylxanthate is formed as the only detectable alkylxanthate species on the surface. Chemisorbed complexes of ethylxanthate ions are formed on sphalerite surfaces in aqueous and acetone slurries.

The initial steady state heat of adsorption for the potassium n-butyl xanthate and sodium cyclohexyl dithiocarbamate was - 67 kJ/mole. When a mixture of these reagents was used this increased to - 90 kJ/mole. In all cases the pH increased during the experiments. When FeS 04 replaced the pyrite the ΔH for the xanthate decreased to - 43. 9 kJ/mole. The results indicated that for the xanthate, the metal thiolate was formed and subsequently oxidised to <b>dixanthogen.</b> The latter reaction did not occur {{in the case of}} the dithiocarbamate, however the extent of the first reaction between the dithiocarbamate and pyrite was controlled by proton availability.

40|$|Previous mineralogical {{investigations}} (QemSCAN) {{performed on}} all effluent flotation streams of Mimosa mine (Zimbabwe) indicated {{the presence of}} appreciable amounts of platinum group minerals (PGMs), which are not recovered. Most, generally in excess of 70 %, of the liberated PGMs in these streams belonged to the Pt-Pd-Bi-Te class in all the samples investigated. In {{the first part of}} this work, electrochemical investigations, electrochemically-controlled contact angle measurements and Raman spectroscopy have been employed to investigate the interaction of ethyl xanthate with Pd-Bi-Te and PtAs 2. Impedance measurements showed lower capacitance values in solutions containing KEX indicating the formation of a continuous surface layer. Anodic and cathodic polarization diagrams show the mixed potential to be higher than the reversible potential of the xanthate-dixanthogen equilibrium reaction, hence the formation of <b>dixanthogen</b> on the surface is possible. Electrochemically controlled in situ Raman spectroscopy has confirmed the co-presence of xanthate with <b>dixanthogen</b> indicating that xanthate retains its molecular integrity when it adsorbs on the surface of the Pd-Bi-Te. The result of this investigation has shown <b>dixanthogen</b> to be present on both the minerals (PtAs 2 and Pd-Bi-Te) when the surfaces are anodically polarized. Chemisorbed xanthate could be identified within 120 seconds yielding a hydrophobic surface as indicated by electrochemically-controlled contact angle measurements. Maximum contact angles of 63 o were measured in the case Pd-Bi-Te. As a result the mineral surface is expected to be hydrophobic and a lack of collector interaction with the mineral is not the reason for low PGM recoveries experienced. Secondly, the flotation recovery of synthetically prepared Pd-Bi-Te was compared with that of chalcopyrite (a typical fast-floating mineral) and pyrrhotite (a typical slow-floating mineral), with microflotation tests. These indicated Pd-Bi-Te to be a fast-floater with flotation rates exceeding that of chalcopyrite. Predicted flotation rate constants (from the Ralston model) were significantly lower for small particles (with diameters similar to those lost to the effluent streams) compared with those of particle with intermediate sizes. This supports the suggestion that losses to effluent streams are caused by particle size effects. Thesis (PhD (Metallurgical Engineering)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

40|$|Metal ion {{production}} by minerals alone and in pairs was studied by solution analysis, extraction with ethylene diamine tetraacetate (EDTA) and laser ion mass spectroscopy (LIMS) for combinations of pyrite, pyrrhotite, galena, and sphalerite. The effect of grinding, pH, {{and the presence}} of xanthate was studied. Metal ion transfer between sulphide minerals was determined. Metal ion production with minerals in pairs was different from that for single minerals. The amount of metal ion in solution followed a galvanic interaction model, increasing for the anodic mineral and decreasing for the cathodic mineral. However, from the EDTA extraction technique, the concentration of metal ions on the mineral surface increased for both minerals. The mechanism of additional metal ion production on the cathodic mineral is unclear, but may be related to reaction between the mineral and OH ions formed on the surface as a result of galvanic interaction. Metal ions transferred between two minerals in contact. In the case of pairing with pyrite, the larger proportion of Fe remained on pyrite, while 50 % or more of Zn (from sphalerite) and Pb (from galena) transferred to pyrite. The effect of Pb ions on pyrite in the presence of xanthate, and diethylene triamine (DETA) was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, ex situ spectroelectrochemical analysis and zeta potential measurements. Once pyrite was contaminated by Pb ions, uptake of xanthate was promoted at pHs 9. 2 and 10. 5 with lime as pH modifier. The source of Pb [...] from solution or from contact with galena [...] was not a factor, and the effect was evident at Pb concentrations as low as 1 ppm. With soda ash as pH modifier, the effect of Pb was suppressed, perhaps due to formation of lead carbonate. The only xanthate product detected was <b>dixanthogen,</b> unless an initial potential less than $-$ 800 mV/SCE was imposed (when Pb$ sp{ 2 +}$ is reduced to Pb$ sp 0) $ and lead xanthate formed. Xanthate adsorption on Pb-contaminated pyrite was suppressed by DETA, but relatively large concentrations were required. DETA decreased the potential at the mineral/solution interface, which retarded oxidation of xanthate to <b>dixanthogen.</b> A mechanism of Pb "activation" of pyrite was proposed: adsorption of Pb(OH) $ sp+$ on pyrite provided sites for xanthate adsorption forming Pb(OH) X, on which xanthate ions were attached by hydrophobic interaction and oxidised to <b>dixanthogen...</b>|$|E

40|$|Kinetic {{studies of}} bubble {{attachment}} and amyl xanthate (AX) adsorption to CuSO (Cu) activated sphalerite and pyrite surfaces were investigated by a novel in-situ approach with high-speed video microscopy (HSVM) and cryogenic X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (Cryo-XPS). The drainage rate (DR) of thin films between the bubble and the surfaces was {{linked with the}} rate of AX adsorption onto the mineral surfaces. The single minerals studies revealed that the drainage (and adsorption) rate on polished pyrite was higher than on polished sphalerite after treatment with AX. However, the AX adsorption rate exhibited a higher value on the Cu-activated sphalerite than on the Cu-activated pyrite, indicating different surface components formed on the minerals surfaces and their different abilities to uptake Cu ions. Modeling AX adsorption rate on the unactivated and activated minerals by a pseudo-first order rate equation revealed the dependence of the drainage (and adsorption) rate on the initial AX concentration and the available active sites on the minerals surfaces. For the two minerals system, AX treatment results showed a significant drop in the adsorption rate of AX on the activated sphalerite with increasing the sphalerite to pyrite surface area ratio from 1 : 1 to 1 : 6. It confirmed the dependence of the AX adsorption rate on the available active sites on the minerals. Cryo-XPS confirmed that Cu-xanthate complex on the Cu-activated sphalerite and <b>dixanthogen</b> on the Cu-activated pyrite were the dominant surface components after treating with AX. It showed a selectivity of AX on the activated sphalerite with chemisorbed Cu-xanthate formation.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{sulphite}} ions on the xanthate-induced flotation of copper-activated pyrite has been studied. Various techniques {{have been used}} to identify the plausible mechanisms of interaction of sulphite with both collector and pyrite surface. It was found that sulphite depressed the xanthate-induced flotation of copper-activated pyrite with nitrogen or air purging at pH 7. However, the depression effect was greater when air was used. Solution and spectroscopic studies indicated that sodium bisulphite interacted with the pyrite surface, as well as with isobutyl xanthate in solution and its adsorbed state. Based on the results obtained, a combination of possible mechanisms has been proposed to explain the depressing effect of sulphite on copper-activated pyrite. It was suggested that both the decomposition of the xanthate in solution via perxanthate formation and <b>dixanthogen</b> desorption from the pyrite surface were responsible for the pyrite depression. Furthermore, iron hydroxy species were formed on the pyrite surface, rendering it hydrophilic, thus preventing the formation of bubble-pyrite particle aggregates...|$|E
40|$|Cyclic Voltammetry {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} on copper, iron, and chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) and compared to mass-balanced EH-pH Diagrams. Potassium ethyl xanthate (KEX) was added to solution and additional voltammetry experiments were performed to determine the surface chemistry reactions of flotation collector in solution with these minerals. The ultimate goal {{of this research was}} to investigate the possibility of xanthate chemisorption onto the chalcopyrite mineral surface. Results of the copper mineral testing confirm previous literature studies and corroborate published isotherm data. Results of the iron mineral testing showed changes in surface reactions with the addition of potassium ethyl xanthate to solution, however, these results were not attributed to the chemisorption of xanthate. Results of the chalcopyrite mineral testing indicate that the surface of the mineral oxidizes to chalcocite (Cu 2 S). In the presence of ethyl xanthate, small currents were observed and attributed to chemisorption of the potassium ethyl xanthate at the chalcocite surface, suggesting that the mineral 2 ̆ 7 s hydrophobicity is induced by more than <b>dixanthogen.</b> This phenomenon was found to be pH-dependent under a range of alkaline conditions (i. e., pH 7 - 12) at narrow potentials (i. e., 0 to - 200 mV) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was designed to}} answer the question: can conventionally polished mineral surfaces be used in electrochemical studies in relation to flotation where minerals are fractured?

A cyclic voltammetry study complements the EIS and double-layer capacitance data. The shape of the capacitance-potential curve as a function of the xanthate concentration evidences a large surface modification of the galena interface at high thiocollector concentrations. Potential Zero Charge (PZC) for the system at- 0. 31 V vs. SCE coincides with the oxidation and adsorption of xanthate (X) on the galena surface, determined from the capacitance-potential curves. The impedance spectrum for the system obtained in the presence of X (0. 1 M) at the PZC show two time-constants associated to the oxidation and adsorption of X and the subsequent formation of <b>dixanthogen</b> (X) 2 according to experimental results obtained and previous data published in the literature. EIS data at more positive potentials than PZC (+ 0. 1 V, 0. 2 V) show an inductive loop which is associated to a charge transfer processes which involves the reaction of the adsorbed intermediates Pb(X) 2 and Pb(OH) 2 with the consequent modification of the PbS-sodium isopropyl xanthate interface.

40|$|Abstract: The {{interaction}} of flotation reagents with metal and mineral surfaces {{have been studied}} with electrochemistry and Raman spectroscopy. Flotation reagents are used to selectively recover valuable minerals (typically particles about 10 microns in diameter) and to suppress the froth flotation of unwanted components by altering the hydrophobicity of the mineral surface. They {{are added to the}} mineral processing circuit and are pre-sent throughout the processing system. The predominant collectors used in the froth flotation proc-ess for sulfide minerals are alkyl dithiocarbonates (xanthates ROCS 2) and similar thio compounds. The reagents adsorb onto mineral surfaces at sub-monolayer levels and can be “tailored ” by altering the R group. Xanthate-mineral interaction occurs by an electrochemical mechanism in which the anodic oxidation of the collector is coupled with the reduction of oxygen at the mineral surface. It has been shown electrochemically [1] that anodic oxidation of xanthate can result in chemisorption of a xanthate radical, and/or dimerization to form <b>dixanthogen.</b> SERS has enabled collection of direct chemical evidence of reagent interaction with copper, silver and gold surfaces under potential control.

40|$|The {{extensive}} {{literature on}} sulfide flotation indicates that pyrite poorly floats under alkaline condition. Xanthate concentration {{has a positive}} effect on pyrite flotation, but above a pH of 11, pyrite seems to be strongly depressed, independently of the concentration in xanthate. In this investigation, aeration and xanthate concentration effects were studied for pyrite flotation conditioned at pH 11 with lime. Results presented in this paper include surface infrared analyses and pulp chemistry measurements which have showed that aeration had a dual effect on pyrite flotation. It induced pyrite surface activation by oxygen, and oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric hydroxides or oxyhydroxides species. It also favoured dissolution of CO 2, leading to calcium carbonate precipitation and adsorption onto pyrite surface. Both CO 2 dissolution and ferrous oxidation generated protons and decreased pulp pH. Pyrite flotation was observed to be effective with a statistical monolayer of xanthate that could be adsorbed as mixture of <b>dixanthogen</b> and metal-xanthate complex. Non-floated fractions showed high amounts of carbonate, and presence of hydroxyl iron sulfate (Fen(OH) m(SO 4) p, xH 2 O) which have inhibited the hydrophobicity effect of adsorbed xanthate. Environmental desulfurisation could be improved by aeration control causing pyrite oxidation and pH decrease to reach optimal flotation condition with a relatively low xanthate concentration...|$|E
40|$|In the {{flotation}} of platinum group minerals (PGMs) {{occurring in}} the Platreef ore body, it is often assumed that the interactions between thiol collectors and tellurides of Pt and Pd {{are similar to those}} occurring with the equivalent sulphides. In order to gain a greater insight into this assumption a rest(mixed) potential study was conducted to investigate the interactions occurring between two thiol collectors, viz. sodium ethyl xanthate (SEX) and sodium diethyl dithiophosphate (SEDTP), and selected PGMs, viz. moncheite (PtTe 2), merenskyite (PdTe 2), cooperite (PtS) and vysotskite (PdS) as well as pure platinum and palladium. The results have shown that all these minerals reacted with the collectors in question but that the rest potential of the Pt minerals are more anodic than those of the Pd minerals. Moreover when SEX was used, <b>dixanthogen</b> is more likely to form on PtS than PtTe 2 but the reverse is the case for PdTe 2 and PdS. In the case of SEDTP {{it was found that the}} dithiolate (SEDTP 2) did not form on any of the mineral surfaces. The results were compared to those already reported in a previous investigation of the same systems using cyclic voltammetry. The information obtained in these two investigations complement each other and may provide a more fundamental understanding of the role of these collectors in recovering the respective minerals...|$|E
40|$|The {{separation}} of minerals by flotation {{depends on the}} effectiveness of the reagents used. The performance of depressants is paramount in rejecting the undesirable minerals while maintaining acceptable recoveries of the desired mineral. Iron-bearing minerals are the main contaminants in many ores: their removal is critical. Several different types of depressants have been used for this purpose, many of which are toxic. A shift has been made toward more environmentally friendly reagents including starch and dextrin. The purpose of this thesis was to determine the depression mechanism of dextrin on pyrite. A number of techniques were applied to give insight into the mechanism, including adsorption studies, microflotation tests, and solution and surface analyses. It was revealed that dextrin only adsorbed on mineral surfaces that contained some metal ionic sites. The degree of adsorption depended {{on the nature of the}} metal species, with lead being more reactive than iron. Dextrin was able to depress pyrite, regardless of whether dextrin adsorbed or not; however, adsorbed dextrin was more effective. It appeared as if dextrin inhibited the formation of <b>dixanthogen</b> on the surface, which could lead to reduced floatability of pyrite. Finally, it was observed that over time, adsorbed dextrin underwent a conformational change on the surface of the mineral. This change permitted a greater amount of xanthate to adsorb on the mineral...|$|E
40|$|The {{iron sulfide}} mineral, {{pyrrhotite}} (Fe(1 -x) S), {{has long been}} known to be more difficult to recover by flotation from alkaline slurries than many other base metal sulfide minerals. This paper summarizes the results of an electrochemical study of the surface reactions that occur during the flotation of nickeliferous pyrrhotite in the recovery of nickel and the platinum group metals. Mixed potential measurements conducted with natural pyrrhotite electrodes in various stages of an operating flotation plant showed that the mineral potential is positive to the equilibrium potential of the xanthate/dixanthogen couple. Similar results were obtained during batch flotation experiments and in synthetic solutions in the laboratory. Cyclic voltammetric and potentiostatic current/time transient experiments were used to investigate the oxidation of pyrrhotite under various conditions. In addition, the reduction of oxygen, the reaction of copper ions and the oxidation of xanthate ions at the mineral surface were investigated. The formation of <b>dixanthogen</b> on pyrrhotite surfaces is thermodynamically favourable in plant flotation slurries. However the interaction with xanthate at pH values above 7 is inhibited by a surface species formed during the conditioning prior to xanthate addition. In acidic solutions copper ions react readily with pyrrhotite to form a species, possibly CuS that can be oxidized at potentials above 0. 4 V. At pH 9 this species does not form and there is no electrochemical reaction between pyrrhotite and copper ions. The beneficial effects of copper ions to flotation performance appear to be related to an enhancement of the oxidation of xanthate...|$|E
40|$|The {{decomposition}} {{behavior of}} several mining reagents (i. e., xanthate, dithiocarbamate, dithiophosphate and dithiophosphinate) used widely in mineral processing operations was studied. Decomposition {{has been reported}} to generate toxic compounds such as CS₂ (carbon disulfide) and COS (carbonyl sulfide), causing severe concerns to SHE (safety, health and environment). With the global trend of becoming sustainable/green and the increasingly strict regulations, the mining industry is facing an unprecedented pressure to handle the problematic reagents that can lead to the adverse impacts. Unfortunately, the interests of the prior research are biased on the performance of the reagents to optimize the efficiency and lower the cost, while the examination of the decomposition behavior is almost neglected. Under the circumstance of poor endeavor found in the prior investigations, the knowledge gap awaits to be filled in a systematic and integrated manner to recommend countermeasures for those problematic reagents. It can be seen from those fragmented studies collected from literature that only a limited understanding of thermal or aqueous decomposition behavior is achieved. It is far from sufficient for industrial guidance of mitigation. One key reason is the lack of robust methods to investigate decomposition under various conditions that are interesting to the mining companies (e. g., the flotation conditions). Consequently, the method development has always been considered of the utmost importance upon the start of this work to align with our overall goal of understanding the decomposition behavior under the various conditions. Three methods under a consistent strategy were designed to examine the decomposition under three conditions from Simple (in aqueous solutions alone), to Complex (in ore pulp under flotation conditions), to Specific (in solution containing metal ions). These three conditions were chosen based on the general interests from several prominent mining companies (Vale, Barrick, Freeport McMoRan and Newmont) to understand the decomposition mechanism and kinetics. The Simple is to serve as control for all other conditions. Besides, most of the prior studies in the literature are only conducted for the Simple condition. Therefore, the Simple is to resolve all discrepancies and conflicts, and provide a relatively comprehensive summary of the decomposition under the control condition. The Complex puts decomposition in a new environment that has never been explored before: the ore pulp under the simulated batch flotation conditions. Conclusions drawn from this part provide the most practical guidance for industrial mitigation. The Specific goes after the Complex to thoroughly understand the effect of a specific factor on decomposition. The decomposition responding to the variation of a certain factor is followed within a closed system with the compositional changes measured in all phases. The integrated analysis enables the correlation of the decomposition behavior to its original causes, which are the interactions of the reagent with other components in the system. Through the systematic investigation of decomposition of various reagents under various conditions, it is concluded that decomposition depends heavily on those parallel or sequential interactions that occur along with the decomposition reaction. For example, the decomposition reaction of xanthate throughout our entire study is regarded as ROCS₂⁻→CS₂. When xanthate forms xanthic acid, monothiocarbanate or <b>dixanthogen</b> with the change of pH, its breakup into CS₂ is altered. When xanthate interacts with Cu²⁺ forming Cu₂X₂, decomposition is depressed, but with Fe³⁺ forming FeX₃ decomposition is promoted. The CS₂ generated from decomposition could interact with OH- to form CS₃²⁻ or dissolve in solution or adsorb on minerals, leading to the decrease of CS₂ detected. The bonding properties between the –CS₂ moiety and other atoms or radicals in the molecule affect the stability of the reagents and the subsequent decomposition. The necessity to include a list of the side-interactions as complete as possible is key to understand and predict the decomposition behavior. With experimental efforts taken to develop methodologies to measure the decomposition under various conditions, the attempt to model the decomposition behavior is also initiated in this work. Based on the conclusions from experimental results, major components determining the output of the final decomposition products are identified. Unsurprisingly, the decomposition reaction together with its parallel and sequential interactions is critical. Simulation using Matlab to assess the decomposition of a simplified system containing SIBX and Cu²⁺ ions has achieved preliminary success by matching well with the experimental measurements. This establishes the groundwork for furthering the simulation of more complex systems and model development. Reagents decompose differently, although they might be applied to function similarly during an operation. As flotation collectors used for sulfide ore beneficiation, dithiocarbamate and xanthate possess some similarities in the decomposition in terms of generating CS₂. Their decomposition also decreases with the chain length. On the other hand, the decomposition of dithiophosphate and dithiophosphinate are different as the breakup of the molecule is mainly at their alkyl chain to generate moieties such as olefins. Compared to the studies carried out to understand the performance of the reagents when being used, research on decomposition requires more attention. Therefore, derivative work can be conducted based on results achieved in this work. For example, it is useful to further examine how reagents decompose after adsorbing on the mineral surfaces. It complements the knowledge to thoroughly understand decomposition at different spots within a complex system. The chemical fate studies of mining reagents with respect to the understanding the decomposition open up the window of developing methodologies to examine adverse behaviors. The experimental setups are applicable to simulate various conditions under which the reagent is being used and generating the adverse impacts. The strategy of analyzing decomposition within a complex system as shown in this study also provides insight into systematically investigating the other types of adverse behaviors...|$|E
