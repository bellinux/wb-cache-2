Methods: Researchers distributed a web-based survey to pharmacists who had viewed the training modules that had been posted onto the training web site of OutcomesMTM. The majority of survey questions consisted of a 6 -point Likert scale. Questions assessed pharmacists’ opinions {{on the use of}} the tools. Information also was collected on implementing MTM tips, pharmacist demographics, and practice site characteristics. Results: Respondents rated the Tool to Improve Medications in the Elderly via Review (TIMER) and DRug Adherence Work-up (<b>DRAW)</b> <b>tools</b> favorably across multiple items. Many pharmacists integrated the MTM tips into their practices, and reported increased efficiency in their delivery of MTM services.

We will use UML tools to model hierarchical hardware modules. We defined some attributes and visibilities for this purpose.

Therefore, we can use any UML <b>draw</b> <b>tools</b> to design our hardware which can export the diagram as an XMI.

40|$|Abstract — Achieving high {{standard}} quality products in almost no time with great economy in industry {{demands for a}} technology that helps exceed the engineering requirement of products. This paper highlights development of ‘draw ’ component and the changes made in product design due to manufacturing and assembly reasons considering the design intent; and also the advantages of using various ‘CAE’ softwares used in designing <b>draw</b> <b>tools.</b> It helps reducing the complete product development cycle as compared to what happens with conventional methods. Lesser effort and ease to model the complete setup and important features with different design parameters, improved the product development without compromising quality. Thorough attempt is aimed for design sheet metal draw die using the latest technology to make it time and cost effective, identifying the problem areas through analysis results and Based on the analysis prepare the query report and suggest revisions/ modifications in the product design. Finally, work out the best die design to produce defect-free components based on the inputs received. Thus using the CAE software one can design economical die because the design changes, modifications and challenges can be observed and solved in the initial phase of the design only. Otherwise without these efforts the die design and the processing could end up as a costly and complicated assignment.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the application of}} mixed-integer programming techniques to solve special classes of network flow problems and stochastic integer programs. We <b>draw</b> <b>tools</b> from complexity and polyhedral theory to analyze these problems and propose improved solution methods. In the first part, we consider semi-continuous network flow problems, that is, a class of network flow problems {{where some of the}} variables are required to take values above a prespecified minimum threshold whenever they are not zero. These problems find applications in management and supply chain models where orders in small quantities are undesirable. We introduce the semi-continuous inflow set with variable upper bounds as a relaxation of general semi-continuous network flow problems. Two particular cases of this set are considered, for which we present complete descriptions of the convex hull in terms of linear inequalities and extended formulations. We also consider a class of semi-continuous transportation problems where inflow systems arise as substructures, for which we investigate complexity questions. Finally, we study the computational efficacy of the developed polyhedral results in solving randomly generated instances of semi-continuous transportation problems. In the second part, we introduce and study the forbidden-vertices problem. Given a polytope P and a subset X of its vertices, we study the complexity of optimizing a linear function on the subset of vertices of P that are not contained in X. This problem is closely related to finding the k-best basic solutions to a linear problem and finds applications in stochastic integer programming. We observe that the complexity of the problem depends on how P and X are specified. For instance, P can be explicitly given by its linear description, or implicitly by an oracle. Similarly, X can be explicitly given as a list of vectors, or implicitly as a face of P. While removing vertices turns to be hard in general, it is tractable for tractable 0 - 1 polytopes, and compact extended formulations can be obtained. Some extensions to integral polytopes are also presented. The third part is devoted to the integer L-shaped method for two-stage stochastic integer programs. A widely used model assumes that decisions are made in a two-step fashion, where first-stage decisions are followed by second-stage recourse actions after the uncertain parameters are observed, and we seek to minimize the expected overall cost. In the case of finitely many possible outcomes or scenarios, the integer L-shaped method proposes a decomposition scheme akin to Benders' decomposition for linear problems, but where a series of mixed-integer subproblems have to be solved at each iteration. To improve the performance of the method, we devise a simple modification that alternates between linear and mixed-integer subproblems, yielding significant time savings in instances from the literature. We also present a general framework to generate optimality cuts via a cut-generating problem. Using an extended formulation of the forbidden-vertices problem, we recast our cut-generating problem as a linear problem and embed it within the integer L-shaped method. Our numerical experiments suggest that this approach can prove beneficial when the first-stage set is relatively complicated. Ph. D...|$|E

40|$|Tool {{making is}} a very time {{consuming}} and expensive operation because many iteration loops are used to manually adjust tool components during the try-out process. That means that trying out deep <b>drawing</b> <b>tools</b> is 30 % of the total costs. This {{is the reason why}} an active deep <b>drawing</b> <b>tool</b> was developed at the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU in cooperation with Audi and Volkswagen to reduce the costs and production rates. The main difference between the active and conventional deep <b>drawing</b> <b>tools</b> is using piezoelectric actuators to control the forming process. The active tool idea, which is the main subject of this research, will be presented as well as the findings of experiments with the custom-built deep <b>drawing</b> <b>tool.</b> This experimental tool was designed according to production requirements and has been equipped with piezoelectric actuators that allow active pressure distribution on the sheet metal flange. The disposed piezoelectric elements are similar to those being used in piezo injector systems for modern diesel engines. In order to achieve the required force, the actuators are combined in a cluster that is embedded in the die of the deep <b>drawing</b> <b>tool.</b> One main objective of this work, i. e. reducing the time-consuming try-out-period, has been achieved with the experimental tool which means that the actuators were used to set static pressure distribution between the blankholder and die.
