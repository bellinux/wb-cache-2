5|$|Although {{produced}} by Universal Pictures, The Brute Man was distributed by Producers Releasing Corporation, {{one of the}} smaller film studios from Hollywood's Poverty Row. In 1945, Universal merged with the company International Pictures, and the new organization adopted a policy against developing any more B movies, including Westerns, horror films, serials and movies running 70minutes or less. This resulted in the firing of numerous production personnel members and the sale of several already-developed films, including The Brute Man. The sale was also perpetuated in part by the death of star Rondo Hatton. He {{died as a result of}} his acromegaly on February2, 1946, about eight months before The Brute Man was first screened, making it his final film. Universal feared releasing the film so soon after his death would lead to accusations that the studio was exploiting the illness that ultimately killed Hatton. Now <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> the film, the studio was anxious to sell it.|$|E
5|$|Another problem {{exposed by}} Rolling Thunder was the unpreparedness of the Air Force for the {{operations}} it was undertaking.

The new campaign exposed years of neglect in conventional tactics, while aircraft capabilities and armament were ill-suited to the task at hand. The Air Force was also <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> {{the fact that the}} Navy was better prepared. It possessed the only all-weather bomber in the U.S. inventory in the new A-6 Intruder and was also responsible {{for the development of the}} F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber, which became ubiquitous during the Vietnam War.|$|E

When Farrar was accepted for an internal medicine residency at the University of Cincinnati, the couple moved to Ohio. Green went into practice at Jewish Hospital as an emergency physician, but grew dissatisfied and eventually switched specialties. She began a second residency in internal medicine, joining Farrar's program.|$|E
5|$|<b>Embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> being shaved bald, as he {{considered}} himself always pure unlike his followers, Punk began wearing a mask {{to hide his}} baldness. At Fatal 4-Way, Punk challenged for the World Heavyweight Championship against Mysterio, Big Show and the champion Jack Swagger, but was unsuccessful when he was attacked by Kane, who was accusing various people of attacking The Undertaker. On July 16, Punk was finally unmasked by Big Show while healing from an arm injury. The following week, Show also unmasked the anonymous member of the Straight Edge Society, who was revealed to be Joey Mercury. This led to a handicap match at SummerSlam where Show defeated the entire Society after Punk abandoned his teammates. Show also beat Punk in a singles match at Night of Champions. Following this, Serena was released from WWE while Mercury became injured, severely thinning the Society. Gallows began showing signs of dissension too, and Punk defeated him on SmackDown, airing September 24, ending the group.|$|E
5|$|Historian Tim Newark unraveled {{the myth}} {{in his book}} Mafia Allies. A version that is {{probably}} {{closer to the truth}} is that Vizzini simply led a delegation of locals to meet an Allied patrol whose commander had asked to speak to whoever was in charge. He quotes local historian, Luigi Lumia, who described how a procession of people with Calogero Vizzini at the helm made its way towards the tanks chanting: 'Long Live America', 'Long Live the Mafia', 'Long Live Don Calo'. Vizzini was taken to a command post outside Villalba and was interrogated about a recent firefight involving an American jeep on patrol. When Vizzini {{made it clear that the}} Italian soldiers had fled and the firefight had been caused by exploding ammunition, the frustrated US army official took his rage out in a stream of obscenities. Vizzini was utterly <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> the incident and ordered his interpreter not to tell anybody what had happened.|$|E
