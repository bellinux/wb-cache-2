Have enough fanaticism to idealize, enough appetite to join in the jolly conviviality of desire, enough understanding to break off in exactly the same way death breaks off, enough rage to want to enjoy it all over again — then one is the favorite of the gods and of the girls." ...|$|E

Each claim can also take one <b>of</b> <b>four</b> truth-values true, false, neither-true-nor-false, and both-true-and-false. However the tradition is clear that the <b>four</b> kinds <b>of</b> statements are distinct from the <b>four</b> values <b>of</b> statements. [...] Nagarjuna is sometimes interpreted as teaching that there is a fifth logical quality besides the <b>four</b> typical <b>of</b> Indian logic, but there are disputing interpretations.|$|R
