40|$|AbstractIn {{the process}} chain for gear manufacturing, gear hobbing {{is one of}} the most {{productive}} processes for soft machining of gears. To reach a high quality after the soft machining, for example in gear finish hobbing, the requirements on the hobbing process increases significantly. To get a high quality part after soft machining, the process of gear hobbing is mostly divided in a roughing and a <b>finishing</b> <b>cut.</b> In the roughing process, the most amount of the material needs to get machined. The finishing process is used to get a high quality shape of the gear and to get low surface roughness. To get low cutting forces in the finishing step, the material stock after the roughing process has to be minimized. A low amount of stock on the flank offers the possibility to use high cutting speeds. This paper deals with the investigation of the two cut processes in the gear hobbing. Especially, the tool life of different tool concepts are taken into account. The process design offers the opportunity to use the same tool for the roughing and the <b>finishing</b> <b>cut</b> or the choice of different tools. Using different tools, a special tool design for the finishing step would be possible. A comparison between these two concepts is the focus of the investigation...|$|E

This paper {{studies the}} surface quality of mould steel with {{high-speed}} wire {{electrical discharge machining}} (WEDM) method, which is conducted in gas to improve the accuracy of finish cut, and compares the surface quality in atmosphere and in emulsion dielectric. Experiment results showed that WEDM in atmosphere offers advantages such as better surface roughness and higher material removal rate. The relationship about winding speed and worktable feed on WEDMed surface quality in semi-finishing cut and <b>finishing</b> <b>cut</b> had been obtained. Morover, a new attemption was successful in applying dry WEDM in multiple cut to improve surface roughness...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Machining {{conditions}} are optimized {{to minimize the}} production cost in conventional manufacturing. In specialized manufacturing applications, such as micro machining and mold making, achievement of specific goals may be the primary objective. The Genetically Optimized Neural Network System (GONNS) is proposed for the selection of optimal cutting conditions from the experimental data when analytical or empirical mathematical models are not available. GONNS use Backpropagation (BP) type neural networks (NN) to represent the input and output relations of the considered system. Genetic Algorithm (GA) obtains the optimal operational condition by using the NNs. In this study, multiple NNs represented {{the relationship between the}} cutting conditions and machining related variables. Performance of the GONNS was tested in two case studies. Optimal operating conditions were found in the first case study to keep the cutting forces in the desired range while a merit criterion (metal removal rate) was maximized in micro-end-milling. Optimal operating conditions were calculated in the second case study to obtain the best possible compromise between the roughness of machined mold surfaces and the duration of <b>finishing</b> <b>cut.</b> To train the NNs 81 mold parts were machined at different cutting conditions and inspected. *Please use the following address for communications...|$|E

Design of prototypes of tool bodies is based on calculations of theoretical number of tool edges. Bodies of milling cutter include holes to mount tool insert holder while two types of insert shape as round and octagonal are used in milling cutter design. Based on measuring of cutting forces when milling planar surfaces, critical cutting conditions leading to the tool damage are identified and they are compared with commercial milling cutters. Applying cutting force data, operation safety is being studied concerning outer appearance of tool failure. Application of Finite Element Method is {{used to assess the}} critical spots leading to the insert holder failure. Maximum stress which brings about ductile fracture of shank style's insert holder has been found out by FEM modelling. Operation capability of tool inserts is compared with tool performance data. Surface roughness and short term tool wear testing was used as tool performance criteria to asses capability of new cutting tools in face milling operations. Surface quality produced by that kind of milling cutter is referred to as semi finishing and <b>finishing</b> <b>cut.</b> Advantages and limitations of that milling cutter innovation are discussed.

40|$|AbstractDistortion {{considerably}} influences manufacturing costs, {{especially if}} thin-walled parts are machined. To ensure a flexible economical machining, novel processes {{have to be}} developed to control distortion within the process chain. Then, reworking by straightening during quenching or by costly hard processing can be kept to a minimum. The fundamental concept of ‘Distortion Engineering’ {{is based on the}} inverse application of identified distortion potential to compensate geometric deviations. In the case of thin-walled bearing rings the distortion is related to both, deviation of the wall thickness and the shape. These deviations originate mainly from an inhomogeneous material removal and uneven residual stress state in the workpieces subsurface caused by deformations due to clamping forces during the soft-turning. An adapted non-circular <b>finishing</b> <b>cut</b> can counteract the distortion. Previous work showed that the adaption of depth of cut depending on assessed geometric irregularities reduces deviations by at least two-third compared to non-compensated cutting. Compensation to zero deviation needs a deeper understanding; hence disturbances during the compensation cuts are investigated within this paper. An uneven change of subsurface residual stress state has a retro-active effect on the workpieces’ shape. Experimental results illustrate that the mechanical process loads are alternating with oscillation of the depth of cut. However, only an impact of adapted cutting on residual stresses perpendicular to the cutting direction (axial stresses) was detected. So far, it can be concluded that adapted cutting not leads to an unexpected change of out-of-roundness during subsequent heat treatment. Additionally, the results revealed that the compensation potential is highly affected by a change of workpieces’ deformation due to material removal during one longitudinal cut...|$|E

40|$|Surface {{roughness}} {{has significant}} effect on functionality and service life of components. If surface roughness is properly controlled then, performance of the component enhances in operational applications. Surface roughness becomes key concern when intricate profiles and shapes are required to be manufactured in components. The objective of the paper is to bring up an adequate surface roughness in <b>finish</b> <b>cut</b> by optimizing process variables. If initial surface form is obtained by proper control of machining parameters then additional finishing efforts and lead time reduce a lot. In the industrial tool room survey availability of machining data is prime concern in terms of tuned process parameter for precision machining. Optimization of process parameters is essential in order to arrest surface roughness and thereby improve surface textures. Experimental investigations are performed to study the effect of pulse current, pulse on time and gap voltage on response of surface roughness, in case of ram EDM. Design of experimentation (DOE) and ANOVA are carried out for optimization of process parameters, within work interval of <b>finish</b> <b>cut</b> machining...|$|R
