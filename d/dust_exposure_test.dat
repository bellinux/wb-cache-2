However, there are no studies reporting associations between occupation and computed tomography (CT) measures of COPD, such as airway wall thickness and lung density. Methods We analyzed data from a cross-sectional hospital and population-based study of current and past smokers conducted in Bergen, Norway between 2003 and 2005. 951 subjects completed an occupational questionnaire and underwent chest CTs to evaluate lung density (% low attenuation areas - %LAA 950) and airway wall thickness (AWT) as a measure of chronic bronchitis. An industrial hygienist assigned a categorical <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> measure, 0 (none, n= 444), 1 (low, n= 308), 2 (medium, n= 129) or 3 (high, n= 50), based on job title and work type. We assessed the relationship between <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> and CT measures using multivariable regression, adjusting for age, sex, smoking and percent total lung capacity (airway obstruction-adjusted) as a measure of breath hold on CT. Results When compared to no <b>dust</b> <b>exposure,</b> the three <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> categories had a 20 % (0. 99 %, 46 %), 54 % (18 %, 102 %), and 33 % (0. 92 %, 93 %) increase in geometric mean %LAA 950, respectively, after adjusting for covariates. This suggests more emphysematous change in the <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> categories. When <b>testing</b> the association between <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> and AWT, the other COPD phenotype, the high dust category had a mean 0. 092 mm (. 002,. 181) greater AWT compared to no <b>dust</b> <b>exposure,</b> after adjusting for covariates. Conclusion <b>Dust</b> <b>exposure,</b> as defined by occupational title and work type, was associated with more areas of low lung density, reflecting more lung emphysema. Lack of power in the high dust category limited the ability to detect a statistically significant dose-response relationship through all levels of <b>dust</b> <b>exposure.</b> The association of high <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> with airway wall thickness suggests that there is an association with chronic bronchitis at high dust levels only. Future studies using a job exposure matrix may allow more precise exposure estimation and quantification of the associations with CT measures of COPD...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of oxidative stress from coal <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> on the number of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in rats. In this experimental study, four groups were evaluated: control; coal <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> at 6. 25 mg/m 3 for 28 days; coal <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> at 12. 5 mg/m 3 for 28 days; coal <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> at 25 mg/m 3 for 28 days (all exposures were given daily for one hour). Circulatory oxidative stress was measured by malondialdehyde level. Osteoblast and osteoclast numbers were counted by light microscopic examination of distal femoral cross-sections stained with hematoxylin eosin. This study showed that malondialdehyde levels were significantly increased in coal <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> groups, in comparison with the control group (p 0. 05). Coal <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> increased malondialdehyde level and osteoclast numbers, and decreased osteoblast numbers, but no correlation was found between oxidative stress (caused by coal <b>dust</b> <b>exposure)</b> and osteoblast and osteoclast numbers...|$|R

Animal models to study these mechanisms are limited. This study investigated the effects of single vs. repetitive dust-induced airway inflammation in mice by intranasal exposure method. Mice were exposed to swine facility dust extract (DE) or saline once and once daily for 1 and 2 wk. <b>Dust</b> <b>exposure</b> resulted in increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid neutrophils and macrophages after single and repetitive exposures. Lavage fluid TNFα, IL- 6, keratinocyte chemoattractant, and macrophage inflammatory protein- 2 were significantly increased after single and repetitive <b>dust</b> <b>exposures,</b> but were dampened in 2 -wk dust-exposed mice compared with single <b>exposure.</b> <b>Dust</b> <b>exposure</b> induced PKCα and -ɛ activation in isolated tracheal epithelial cells but were dampened with repetitive exposures. Ex vivo stimulation of alveolar macrophages from 2 -wk animals demonstrated reduced cytokine responsiveness and phagocytic ability. Significant lung pathology occurred with development of mixed mononuclear cellular aggregates (T and B lymphocytes, phagocytes) after repetitive <b>dust</b> <b>exposure,</b> a novel observation. Airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine occurred after single <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> but resolved after 2 wk.

40|$|The {{respiratory}} {{health of}} workers exposed to polyvinylchloride (PVC) dust has been investigated in 818 men sampled from the work force of a factory manufacturing PVC. In a cross-sectional survey, the lung function and prevalences of respiratory symptoms and chest radiographic abnormalities were compared with estimates of individual PVC <b>dust</b> <b>exposures</b> based on detailed occupational histories and current measurements of respirable PVC dust. Complaints of slight exertional dyspnoea were associated with PVC <b>dust</b> <b>exposure,</b> though age and smoking effects were much stronger. The forced expired volume in one second (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) {{were inversely related to}} <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> after age, height, and smoking effects had been taken into account. This effect was seen principally in cigarette smokers, and there was suggestive evidence that PVC <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> and cigarette smoking interacted in the reduction of FEV 1 and FVC. Gas transfer factor was not related to <b>dust</b> <b>exposure.</b> The chest radiographs were read according to the ILO U/C classification by three experienced readers. One reader recorded a low prevalence of small rounded opacities, and these were not related to age or <b>dust</b> <b>exposure.</b> Another reader recorded a higher prevalence of small rounded opacities category 0 / 1 or more, and these were related to age but not to <b>dust</b> <b>exposure.</b> The third reader recorded the highest prevalence of small rounded opacities (though none greater than category 1 / 1), and these were independently related both to age and to PVC <b>dust</b> <b>exposure,</b> indicating an effect of PVC dust on the appearance of the chest radiography. These appearances were so slight that only the higher sensitivity of this reader in the interpretation of profusion of small rounded opacities on the ILO U/C scale enabled detection of this effect of PVC <b>dust.</b> In conclusion, <b>exposure</b> to PVC <b>dust</b> is associated with some deterioration of lung function, slight abnormalities of the chest radiograph, and complaints of slight dyspnoea.

40|$|A {{previous}} {{study showed that}} exposure of workers to polyvinylchloride (PVC) dust {{was associated with the}} presence of small rounded opacities in the chest radiograph, and also with a small average reduction of the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1). Studies have now been carried out on selected men to determine the clinical importance of the presence of small rounded opacities and also to identify any clinical or physiological features associated with PVC <b>dust</b> <b>exposure.</b> Among 28 men with small rounded opacities, complaints of persistent bronchial mucous hypersecretion were more common (nine men) than amont 29 men of similar age, smoking habits, and <b>dust</b> <b>exposures</b> (one man, p less than 0. 01), and there was a suggestion that the physical sign of late inspiratory crackles was more frequent among men with opacities (seven of 27 men) than the other men (two of 28 men, p less than 0. 05). The average lung function of men with opacities was only trivially lower than that of the comparative group and the difference between the groups was not significant. In further studies 13 non-smokers with the highest PVC <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> and lowest FEV 1 (adjusted for age, height, weight, and <b>dust</b> <b>exposure)</b> were examined. None had an observed FEV 1 less than 80 % of the predicted value for age and height, and these men did not differ in symptoms, signs, or lung function from non-smokers with low <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> and similarly low FEV 1. In a similar study of 18 smokers with the highest PVC <b>dust</b> <b>exposures</b> and lowest adjusted FEV 1, some men had an observed FEV 1 well below 80 % of predicted values for non-smokers, but with one exception no clinical or functional differences were found between then and 18 smokers with low <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> and similarly low FEV 1. The exception was again the presence of end inspiratory crackles on auscultation, which were slightly more frequent among men with the highest <b>dust</b> <b>exposures</b> (seven men) than among those with low exposure (two men, p less than 0. 06). We conclude that {{these findings are consistent with}} the suggestion that the radiographic abnormalities caused by PVC <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> are not associated with important functional effects or clinical illness.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Reducing <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> of {{operators}} on longwall faces {{remains a}} challenging issue for mine managements. Most of the Australian mines are adopting uni-di cutting method to reduce operators <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> levels. Even in this uni-di cutting mode, the dust roll-up towards the walkway area {{is very high}} in most cases and is resulting in high <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> levels for shearer and chock operators. With the support of ACARP, CSIRO has been undertaking several research projects (C 12025, C 13019 and C 14036) based upon CFD modelling to improve the understanding of dust flow patterns around the longwall shearer and walkway under different operating conditions, {{and the study of}} a range of dust control options/concepts for reducing operators <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> levels. During these simulation studies, a shearer scrubber system has shown to be capable of significantly modifying the airflow patterns around the maingate cutting drum and reducing dust roll-up towards the walkway area...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND. In {{recent years}} it has been {{suggested}} an association between the occupational <b>exposure</b> to cement <b>dust</b> and the occurrence of short term respiratory effects. This relationship still remains controversial, mainly for what concern low dose <b>exposures</b> to cement <b>dust.</b> OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the relationship between the daily fluctuations of cement <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> and the lung function changes in workers employed with various job titles in a cement factory. METHODS: 15 workers randomly selected and representative of the entire population of cement production workers have been studied for 3 consecutives days. For each worker enrolled in the study we measured daily personal <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> and possible short-term pulmonary effects (asking questions about daily symptoms and recording flow-volume parameters both pre-shift and post-shift work). RESULTS: We did not find evidence of association between daily cement <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> fluctuation and short term respiratory effects. CONCLUSION: It has to be said that the main reason for the lack of effects between cement <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> and lung function decrement in our study may be linked to the low levels of personal <b>dust</b> <b>exposure.</b> Anyway, due to the little sample size of workers enrolled we cannot still make conclusive statements...|$|R

Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), height and weight were measured, and questionnaire data on respiratory symptoms, wood <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> and smoking habits were collected. Cumulative inhalable wood <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> was assessed using a study-specific job exposure matrix and exposure time. The median (range) for cumulative wood <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> was 3. 75 (0 – 7. 55) mg?year?m- 3. A dose– response relationship between cumulative wood <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> and percent annual decrease in FEV 1 was suggested for female workers. This was confirmed in a linear regression model adjusted for confounders, including smoking, height and age.

Methods Settled organic dust was obtained from swine confinement facilities. Promonocytic THP- 1 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes were pretreated with or without dust extract and then restimulated. Culture supernatants were evaluated for TNF-a, IL- 6, CXCL 8, and IL- 10. Responses were compared with endotoxin-depleted dust, LPS, and peptidoglycan. PKC isoform (a, d,, ?) activation was evaluated by direct kinase activity. PKC isoform inhibitors' effects on TNF-a secretion were studied. Results Single <b>exposure</b> to organic <b>dust</b> stimulated monocyte secretion of TNF-a, IL- 6, CXCL 8, and IL- 10 compared with unstimulated cells. TNF-a and IL- 6 were diminished in pretreated cells restimulated with dust. Secretion of CXCL 8 and IL- 10 remained persistently elevated. TNF-a responses were retained after marked depletion of endotoxin. <b>Dust</b> <b>exposure</b> induced significant PKC a, d,, and ? activation, peaking at 30 to 60 minutes.

40|$|Background Epidemiological {{evaluations}} {{of the risk of}} silicosis in relation to exposure to crystalline silica have raised the question ofwhetherdifferent types of silica <b>dust</b> <b>exposures</b> vary with respect to their ability to cause silicosis. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the risk of silicosis among cohorts of silica dust-exposed Chinese tin miners, tungsten miners, and pottery workers and to assess whether gravimetric measurements of respirable silica dust sufficiently determine the risk of silicosis or whether other factors of exposure may play a significant role. Methods Cohorts were selected from 20 Chinese mines and potteries. Inclusion criteria were starting employment after January 1, 1950 and being employed for at least 1 year during 1960 – 1974 in one of the selected workplaces. Radiological follow-up for silicosis onset was from January 1, 1950 through December 31, 1994. Silicosis was assessed ac-cording to the Chinese radiological criteria for diagnosis of pneumoconiosis (as suspect, Stage I, II, or III). Exposure–response relationships were estimated for silicosis of Stage I or higher. Silica <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> was estimated in terms of cumulative total <b>dust</b> <b>exposure,</b> calculated from a workplace, job title, and calendar year exposure matrix, and individual occupational histories. Cumulative total <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> was converted in two steps into cumulative respirable <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> and cumulative respirable silica <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> using conversion factors estimated from side-by-side measurements conducted in 1988 – 89. Results The male cohorts included 4, 028 tin miners, 14, 427 tungsten miners, and 4, 547 pottery workers who had similar onset of employment and duration of follow-up. For a given exposure level, the risk of silicosis was higher for the tin and tungsten than the potteryworkers.

The cohort comprised 3, 250 employees with a median follow-up duration of around 37 years. Incident cases of silicosis were identified via silicosis registries (Chinese X-ray stage I, similar to International Labor Organisation classification scheme profusion category 1 / 1).

40|$|Abstract Background Few {{studies have}} been carried out on acute effects of cement <b>dust</b> <b>exposure.</b> This study is {{conducted}} to investigate the associations between current "total" <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> and acute respiratory symptoms and respiratory function among cement factory workers. Methods A combined cross-sectional and cross-shift study was conducted in Dire Dawa cement factory in Ethiopia. 40 exposed production workers from the crusher and packing sections and 20 controls from the guards were included. Personal "total" dust was measured in the workers' breathing zone and peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured for all selected workers before and after the shift. When the day shift ended, the acute respiratory symptoms experienced were scored and recorded on a five-point Likert scale using a modified respiratory symptom score questionnaire. Results The highest geometric mean <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> was found in the crusher section (38. 6 mg/m 3) followed by the packing section (18. 5 mg/m 3) and the guards (0. 4 mg/m 3). The highest prevalence of respiratory symptoms for the high exposed workers was stuffy nose (85 %) followed by shortness of breath (47 %) and "sneezing" (45 %). PEF decreased significantly across the shift in the high exposed group. Multiple linear regression showed a significant negative association between the percentage cross-shift change in PEF and total <b>dust</b> <b>exposure.</b> The number of years of work in high-exposure sections and current smoking were also associated with cross-shift decrease in PEF. Conclusions Total cement <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> was related to acute respiratory symptoms and acute ventilatory effects. Implementing measures to control dust and providing adequate personal respiratory protective equipment for the production workers are highly recommended. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this cross-sectional {{study was to investigate}} the prevalence and determinants of respiratory symptoms and their association with occupational <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> among the brick kiln workers. Brick kiln workers are exposed to dust particles and are susceptible to multiple pulmonary complications. Problems like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary symptoms, and silicosis are more common among them. As brick kiln industry is an unorganized sector, so it was decided to evaluate the respiratory symptoms and lung capacities in these workers and compare them with controls. This study included 120 brick kiln factory workers occupationally exposed to dust and 80 unexposed workers as controls. Mean respirable <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> in firing section was the highest (19. 51 mg/m 3) while mean respirable <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> in mixing & molding section was the lowest (10. 08 mg/m 3).

40|$|SummaryWe {{conducted}} a cross-sectional survey in a cellulose plant among 109 reed workers, exposed to reed dust and 78 unexposed office workers, to investigate respiratory {{health effects of}} reed <b>dust</b> <b>exposure.</b> Investigations included <b>dust</b> measurements, serum total IgE, skin prick test, pulmonary function testing and questionnaire on respiratory symptoms. Total dust level in the reed processing unit was higher than the office (9. 7 and 0. 02 mg/m 3, respectively). Reed workers had {{a higher rate of}} current smoking (67 % and 46 %, respectively). After the adjustment for smoking status and age, reed <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> was significantly associated with wheezing, chronic cough, dyspnea, itching eyes and itching nose. Chest tightness and ODTS symptoms were only reported by reed workers (27. 5 % and 23. 9 %, respectively). After the adjustment for pack-years of smoking, percentage of predicted FEV 1, FVC, FEV 1 /FVC and FEF 25 − 75 in reed workers were significantly lower than office workers. Among reed workers, wheezing was associated with older age (> 40 years) and ever smoking, and cross-shift decline in FVC and FEV 1 with shorter duration of work. Reed <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> in the workplace could provoke respiratory symptoms, possibly due to an irritating effect. Health selection bias is likely, and could have underestimated the health effects of reed <b>dust</b> <b>exposure...</b>|$|R

Sigsgaard* ABSTRACT: The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate the occurrence of new respiratory symptoms in relation to wood <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> in a 6 -yr follow-up study. A total of 1, 377 woodworkers (1, 137 males; 240 females) and 297 reference workers (137 males; 160 females) participated. Data on respiratory symptoms, employment and smoking habits were collected. Wood <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> was assessed from baseline dust measurements, and cumulative wood <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> was assessed by study-specific job exposure matrices and exposure time. The geometric mean (geometric SD) dust level decreased during the study period from 0. 94 (2. 1) to 0. 60 (1. 6) mg?m- 3. Adjusted analysis revealed positive associations for cumulative incidence proportion of chronic bronchitis and daily coughing for female woodworkers versus female reference workers. The cumulative incidence proportion of daily coughing and chronic bronchitis were found to be associated with baseline wood <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> in a dose-dependent manner. The odds ratio (95 % confidence interval) for daily coughing (with reference to the lowest exposure quartile) was 1. 6 (0. 6 – 4. 3), 3. 2 (0. 9 – 6. 8) and 3. 8 (1. 5 – 9. 7), respectively, in the second and third lowest and the highest quartile. The figures for chronic bronchitis were, accordingly, 2. 3 (0. 4 – 14. 5), 3. 0 (0. 5 – 18. 7) and 6. 0 (1. 2 – 28. 8). In conclusion, female woodworkers in this low exposure cohort showed an increased {{incidence of}} coughing and bronchitis, whereas no relations to wood <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> were seen for male woodworkers...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{recognised}} {{that exposure}} to respirable coalmine dust causes a reduction in lung function {{but it has not}} been clear whether the impairment of function is sufficient to cause disability, unless progressive massive fibrosis occurs. From a study of 4059 men without progressive massive fibrosis who worked in the coal industry for at least ten years from the 1950 s, and who were followed up and re-examined medically more than 20 years later, a subgroup was selected using criteria intended to favour those who may have suffered greater than average effects of <b>dust</b> <b>exposure.</b> These 199 men had left the coal industry before normal retiral age, had taken other jobs, and had reported symptoms of chronic bronchitis at follow up. The inverse relation between <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> and FEV 1 among these 199 men was much more severe than the average effects previously shown among more representative groups of coalminers. The effect of <b>exposure</b> to respirable <b>dust</b> was estimated conservatively as an impairment of about 2 ml FEV 1 per unit of <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> (gh/m 3). The estimated effect among ex-smokers was more severe. These compare with a previous estimate, based on a less selected population, of 0. 6 ml FEV 1 per gh/m 3. The new estimate in this group of 199 men corresponds to an average loss of 600 ml FEV 1 in response to a moderately high <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> to 300 gh/m 3, with correspondingly higher losses in the ex-smokers. These findings show that among a group of men intentionally selected to include those who may have suffered greater than average effects of <b>dust</b> <b>exposure,</b> the relation between exposure and FEV 1 is consistent with the view that in some men even moderately high <b>exposure</b> to <b>dust</b> causes severe impairment of lung function...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Exposed to low {{concentration}} of inhaled dust {{for a long}} time can cause respiratory tract disorders such as restriction, obstruction or mixed. Generally, organic and non organic <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> will effect on obstruction of respiratory tract, which is indicated by decreasing of FEV 1 /FVC. Workers of limestone industries have a high risk from inhaled dust deposition on their respiratory tract. Absorption of inhaled dust particles in the lung is occurred by respiration mechanism. Method : This research purpose was to analyze association between inhaled <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> and lung function disorder on workers in limestone industry (Study at Village of Mrisi, Sub District of Tanggungharjo) in Grobogan Regency. This research was an observational study using cross sectional approach for 60 samples. Sample was carried out by using a systematic probability sampling. Data were analyzed by using Chi Square test after controlling for gender, age, working years, smoking habit, exercise, nutrient status, awareness in using Personal Protective Equipment and time of exposure. Multivariate analysis was carried out by Logistic Regression test with the method of backward stepwise. Result : The result of this research showed  that inhaled <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> significantly influences the occurrence of lung function disorder (p = 0. 02 and Odds Ratio = 5. 833 with 95 %CI : 1. 865 – 18. 245). Probability of inhaled <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> factor toward lung function disorder whichw was assessed by Logistic Regression formula resulted in inhaled <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> over the Threshold Limit Value of  3 mg/m 3 is 68. 6 %. Most of respondents who were exposed to dust and have significant association with the occurrence of lung disorder have some characteristics namely female, normal nutrient status, and awareness in using Personal Protective Equipment.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} effects of <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> and smoking on {{mortality}} of respiratory system diseases (RSD). METHODS: Based on the Guangzhou Occupational Health Surveillance Record System established between 1989 and 1992, 80, 987 factory workers, aged 30 years old or older, occupationally exposed or not exposed to dusts, were included in a prospective cohort study. RESULTS: (1) The {{mean age of the}} cohort was 43. 5. Most subjects were workers, had secondary education, and almost all were married. The <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> rate was 16. 3 %, the smoking rate 43. 7 % and the alcohol-drinking rate 33. 5 %. (2) The cohort was followed up for 8 years on average, but 35 people (0. 04 %) were lost for follow up. Among the 1593 deaths, 219 and 90 people died of lung cancer and non-cancer respiratory system diseases (NCRSD) respectively. (3) The adjusted relative risk (RR) of death of lung cancer for smokers, 3. 32, was 2. 2 times of that for dust exposed workers, 1. 53, and the RR of death of NCRSD for dust exposed workers, 2. 41, 1. 28 times of that for smokers, 1. 89, especially for silica dust-exposed workers, 5. 72, 3. 03 times of that for smokers. <b>Dust</b> <b>exposure</b> combined with smoking caused significantly higher RR of death of RSD. (4) In male, the death risks of RSD were increased with the amount of smoking per day and years of smoking. CONCLUSION: Occupational <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> and smoking may cause excessive lung cancer and NCRSD death with synergistic effects. Smoking has higher RR of Lung cancer death than <b>dust</b> <b>exposure.</b> However, the <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> contributes to higher RR of NCRSD death. There is a significant dose-effect relationship between smoking and the death risk of RSD. 目的比較接塵、吸煙對呼吸系統疾病死亡的影響。方法在 1989 年至 1992 年廣州建立職業健康監護檔案的基礎上對 30 歲以上、職業接觸粉塵和無粉塵接觸的 80 987 名工人進行前瞻性隊列研究。結果(1) 隊列平均年齡 43 ． 5 歲,職業性粉塵接觸率 16 ． 3 %,吸煙率 43 ． 7 %,飲酒率 33 ． 5 %。(2) 隊列平均隨訪 8 年, 35 人失訪,失訪率 0 ． 04 %,總死亡 1593 人中, 219 人死于肺癌, 90 人死于非惡性腫瘤性呼吸系統疾病。(3) 調整相關因素后,相對于不吸煙者,吸煙者肺癌死亡相對危險度(RR) 為 3 ． 32,是粉塵接觸者相對于無粉塵接觸者肺癌死亡RR(1 ． 53) 的 2 ． 2 倍。粉塵接觸者非惡性腫瘤性呼吸系統疾病死亡RR為 2 ． 41,是吸煙者(1 ． 89) 的 1 ． 28 倍。尤其是矽塵接觸者,其非惡性腫瘤性呼吸系統疾病死亡RR為 5 ． 72,是吸煙者的 3 ． 03 倍。既接觸粉塵又吸煙,呼吸系統疾病死亡RR增加更明顯。(4) 男性吸煙者呼吸系統疾病死亡危險分別隨日吸煙量、煙齡的增加而增加。結論職業接觸粉塵和吸煙均可引致超額的呼吸系統疾病死亡,兩者存在協同作用。吸煙致肺癌死亡RR高于接塵,而致非惡性腫瘤性呼吸系統疾病死亡RR則低于接塵。吸煙與呼吸系統疾病死亡危險存在明顯的劑量-效應關系。link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} on <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> and {{respiratory}} health among cement cleaners. There {{are only a}} few follow-up studies on respiratory health among cement factory workers and also studies on acute effects of cement <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> are limited in numbers. Objective: This study aimed at assessing cement <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> and adverse respiratory health effects among Ethiopian cement production workers, with particular focus on cement cleaners. Method: The first paper was a combined cross-sectional and cross-shift study. Forty exposed cement production workers from the crusher and packing sections and 20 controls from the guards were included. Full-shift personal total dust was measured in the breathing zone of the workers and Peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured for all selected workers before and after the shift. A modified respiratory symptom score questionnaire was used to assess acute respiratory symptoms experienced {{at the end of the}} work shift. The second paper comprises an exposure assessment carried out in two cement factories (A and B). Personal full-shift samples of total (n= 150) and respirable dust (n= 36) were taken in the breathing zone of 105 cement workers. The third paper was a follow-up study, 112 personal total dust samples were collected from 46 workers. In total 127 workers; 56 cleaners, 44 cement production workers and 27 controls were randomly selected and examined for lung function and interviewed about chronic respiratory symptoms at baseline in 2009. Of these, 91 workers; 38 cement cleaners, 33 cement production workers and 20 controls were reexamined with the same methods one year later. Results: In the first paper we found that the exposed workers had considerably higher geometric mean (GM) total <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> (38. 6 mg/m 3 and 18. 5 mg/m 3 in the crusher and packing, respectively) than the controls (0. 4 mg/m 3). Stuffy nose (85 %), shortness of breath (47 %) and sneezing (45 %) were the most prevalent acute respiratory symptoms among the high exposed workers. PEF decreased significantly across the shift in the high exposed group. In the second paper, cleaners had significantly higher exposure to total and respirable dust than other production workers. Among cleaners, the GM for total and respirable <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> were 549 and 6. 8 mg/m 3 in Factory A and 153 and 2. 8 mg/m 3 in Factory B. Temporal variability (within-worker) dominated the variability in the cleaners’ total <b>dust</b> <b>exposure.</b> The distance from machines while performing cleaning tasks and the fraction of working hours spent on cleaning explained about 73 % of the temporal variability in total <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> among cleaners. Only 7 % of the cement production workers used respiratory protective devices. In the follow-up study, total GM <b>dust</b> <b>exposure</b> among cleaners was 432 mg/m 3. The levels were considerably lower among the production workers (GM= 8. 2 mg/m 3), but still 48 % exceeded 10 mg/m 3. The prevalence of all the chronic respiratory symptoms among both cleaners and production workers was significantly higher than among the controls. Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV 1) and FEV 1 / Forced Vital Capacity (FEV 1 /FVC) were significantly reduced from 2009 to 2010 among the cleaners and production workers, but not among the controls. Conclusion This study has shown increased prevalence of acute and chronic respiratory symptoms as well as reduced lung function among dust exposed cement production workers and excessively exposed cleaners than among the less exposed controls. It is likely that the adverse respiratory health effects are related to the <b>dust</b> <b>exposure...</b>|$|R
