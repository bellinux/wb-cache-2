5|$|In 1914, aliens {{known as}} Mondoshawans {{arrive at an}} ancient Egyptian temple to collect, for {{safekeeping}} concerning World War <b>I,</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> weapon capable of defeating a great evil that appears every 5,000years. The weapon consists of four stones, containing the essences of the four classical elements, and a sarcophagus containing a fifth element {{in the form of}} a human, which combines the power of the other four elements into a divine light capable of defeating the evil. The Mondoshawans promise their human contact, a priest from a secret order, that they will come back with the weapon in time to stop the great evil when it returns.|$|E
5|$|In Mendeleev's 1871 {{periodic}} table, copper, silver, {{and gold}} are listed twice, once under group VIII (with the iron triad and platinum group metals), and once under group IB. Group IB was nonetheless parenthesised {{to note that}} it was tentative. Mendeleev's main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element: on that basis, the group 11 elements could not be classified in group IB, due {{to the existence of}} copper(II) and gold(III) compounds being known at that time. However, eliminating group IB would make group <b>I</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> main group (group VIII was labelled a transition group) to lack an A–B bifurcation. Soon afterward, a majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in group IB and remove them from group VIII for the resulting symmetry: this was the predominant classification until the rise of the modern medium-long 18-column periodic table, which separated the alkali metals and group 11 metals.|$|E

500|$|The Los Angeles Times said, [...] " [...] overstuffed with plot lines, set {{pieces and}} villains, {{although}} stars Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone {{do their best}} to give the movie heart." [...] Tim Robey of The Telegraph said, [...] "Marc Webb's Spider-Man sequel is overstuffed with high-voltage villains, but the sparks between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone save the day". Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy said, [...] "Peter's past, present and future all intertwine in a sequel that offers bang for your buck. That said you can't help [...] feel the franchise bean counters at work here thanks to all the ominous foreshadowing and unresolved character arcs. Too many cooks and all that...". Kim Newman of Empire scored the film three out of five stars, saying: [...] "A few too-broad gags aside — and even these are in the funky spirit of '60s Marvel — this is a satisfying second issue with thrills, heartbreak, gasps, and a perfectly judged slingshot ending." [...] Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "The eponymous hero hits his super-heroic stride here, as does Andrew Garfield in the role, especially when Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker learns there's always some fine print in a contract with this many benefits. The plot gets itself tangled up in multiple villain strands, but in the main, this installment is emotionally weightier and more satisfying than its predecessor." [...] Guy Lodge of Variety said, [...] "Redundancy remains a problem, but this overlong superhero sequel gets by on sound, fury and star chemistry." [...] Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, stating that [...] "It's about 20 minutes too long and it's overstuffed with too many characters and too many subplots, but there's enough good stuff in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 to warrant optimism about the next chapter of the franchise." [...] A negative review came from Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, giving the film two stars out of four, he said: [...] "Things go wrong quickly with Amazing 2. Am <b>I</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one who hates the word Amazing to describe a movie that isn't? Just asking." [...] IGN reviewer Daniel Krupa gave 6.9/10 and wrote, [...] "Amazing Spider-Man 2 gets a lot right, yet there’s a constant awkwardness to the machinery of its plot; you can almost hear the cogs turning. However, what’s worse is that at times it becomes overtly patronising: there are flashing screens and computer voice-overs constantly telling you what something is or what something is doing, just in case the people in the back rows aren’t paying attention, which feels at odds with the film’s emotional intelligence.|$|E

2500|$|The Ole Miss Rebels are the intercollegiate {{athletic}} teams officially {{representing the}} University of Mississippi. Originally {{known as the}} [...] "Mississippi Flood", the teams were renamed the Rebels in 1936 and compete in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)'s Division <b>I.</b> <b>The</b> <b>only</b> exception is the rifle team, which participates in the Great America Rifle Conference because the SEC does not sponsor that sport. The school's colors are red (PMS 186) and navy blue (PMS 2767), purposely chosen to mirror the school colors of Harvard and Yale, respectively. With {{a long history in}} intercollegiate athletics (Ole Miss began football in 1890), the university competes in 18 men's and women's sports. Student-athletes, 630 in all, received all-conference academic honors from 1995 to 2004.|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversial}} penalty calls {{made during}} Super Bowl XL {{were met with}} criticism from both fans {{and members of the}} media, many of whom suggested that the officials had wrongly nullified several key plays made by the Seattle offense. Jason Whitlock encapsulated the views of a few when he wrote the day after the game, [...] "Leavy and his crew ruined Super Bowl XL. Am <b>I</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one who would like to hear them defend their incompetence?" [...] In response to the criticisms, NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said in a statement, [...] "The game was properly officiated, including, as in most NFL games, some tight plays that produced disagreement about the calls made by the officials." [...] The game ended a playoff season that was plagued by complaints about officiating.|$|E

They try to comfort her and express their affection, but she {{describes}} her unhappiness by explaining that, once a flower has withered, when cut at its roots it cannot come back to life. Then, she expresses her real feelings of frustration against Filippo: (Aria: Ma la sola, oimė! son io, / che penar per lui si veda? / [...] "Am <b>I</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one to whom he has brought grief"? she asks) and feels her shame, to the sorrow of her ladies. In a finale, first Beatrice, then the ladies express their frustrations: (Cabaletta: Ah! la pena in lor piombò / [...] "Ah, they have been punished for the love that ruined me").|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} create more time for Bellini to finish, the La Fenice {{impresario}} Lanari padded the programme with older works or revivals, but that allowed only eight days for Beatrice before the scheduled end of the season. Not surprisingly, the audience having waited so long for the new work, greeted the opening night on 16 March with little enthusiasm, their rejection demonstrated by cries of Norma! upon hearing Pasta's first aria, Ma la sola, oimė! son io, / che penar per lui si veda? ("Am <b>I</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one to whom he has brought grief?"), thinking that they heard echoes of the music from the earlier opera. Their indifference was magnified after reading Romani's plea for [...] "the reader's full indulgence" [...] {{which appeared in the}} libretto with the suggestion that its faults were not his. But at the following two performances there were large crowds. For Bellini, his opera [...] "was not unworthy of her sisters".|$|E

[...] The video has been widely disseminated online, and an edited version {{is available on the}} Daily Bruin site. Tabatabainejad is first heard (though not seen) repeatedly shouting [...] "Don't touch me!" [...] to the officers. Over the course of the video, he is stunned multiple times, while officers repeatedly order him to stand up and stop fighting, and threaten to administer further stuns. Tabatabainejad repeatedly states that he is not fighting and that he will leave the premises. [...] He shouts that he has a medical condition, and shouts [...] "Here's your PATRIOT Act! Here's your fucking abuse of power!" [...] Witnesses say that when it was clear none of the other students were going to help him, Tabatabainejad said [...] "Am <b>I</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> martyr?" [...] According to one witness, [...] " [...] no possible danger to any of the police. [...] getting shocked and Tasered as he was handcuffed." [...] Bystanders can be heard demanding the officers' names and badge numbers, and shouting for them to stop using the Taser on Tabatabainejad; numerous times these officers responded to demands of their badge numbers with phrases such as [...] "do you want to get tased too?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The cave {{for which}} the city is named {{is located on the}} south side of Main Street. Various {{explanations}} are given for its unusual name. One is that Native Americans or outlaws hid horses in the cave; another is that an early carriage may have lost a horse when it fell into the opening by accident; a third reason involves the 19th-century use of [...] "horse" [...] as slang for anything big or huge, related to a similar use of the Swedish hoss. The cave has also been known as [...] "Hidden River Cave", for an underground stream located inside. That stream was used to power a dynamo, and for a while in the late 19th century Horse Cave was the only city in Kentucky apart from Louisville and Ashland to have electric lights. Around World War <b>I,</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> air-conditioned tennis courts in the world were located near the entrance of the cave. The stream also provided the town's water supply, but mistaken development caused raw sewage to seep into the water and forced the closure of the cave for fifty years. The stench was so bad in the 1960s that pedestrians typically crossed to the other side of Main Street rather than walk near the entrance and birds would sometimes fall from the sky. The problem has been largely solved in recent years.|$|E
