5000|$|Pruning: The pruning method {{known as}} [...] "taille à queue du Mâconnais" [...] (lit. Maconnais tail pruning) {{is typical of}} the Maconnais {{district}} and is a variation on <b>Guyot</b> <b>pruning.</b> This technique of bending of the wood into an arc during pruning is designed to prevent acrotony, a characteristic defect of Chardonnay vines, and also serves to protect the plants against spring frosts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{density of}} {{planting}} required {{is at least}} 7,000 vines per hectare. The rows should be positioned no more than 1.5 metres apart and the distance between any two vines within a row should not be less than 0.8 metres. The vines are pruned every year before the first leaves have opened fully. The aim is to keep a maximum of 12 renewal buds per vine (each renewal bud will produce a side branch bearing a cluster of grapes). Authorized pruning methods include the so-called [...] "médocaine" [...] method (the local name for <b>Guyot</b> <b>pruning),</b> with either cane pruning or cane and spur pruning, and the so-called [...] "à cots" [...] method (spur pruning), based on the methods traditionally called Cordon de Royat (unilateral cordon) or éventail (fan).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The agronomical {{responses}} of Chardonnay, a variety indicated for sparkling wine production, {{is influenced by}} the vineyard management and the edaphoclimatic conditions of the region. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of two pruning types (Royat and double Guyot) on vegetative and reproductive development of Chardonnay vine growing at high altitude in the Brazilian southeastern region. The experiment was carried out in a commercial vineyard located at 1, 280 m of altitude in Divinolândia, São Paulo State, Brazil. The Chardonnay vines (clone 96), grafted onto 1103 Paulsen rootstock and trained in a vertical shoot positioning trellis system, were assessed. Vegetative vigor, bud fruitfulness, production and physicochemical composition of grapes were evaluated during 2014 and 2015 growing seasons. The Royat pruning induced higher vegetative vigor and increased the bud fruitfulness, the cluster number and the productivity of Chardonnay vine when compared to <b>Guyot</b> <b>pruning.</b> Even though the increase on yield was observed, there was no effect of pruning type on grape final quality. Therefore, the choice of pruning method in function of variety genetic characteristics and their interaction with environment can optimize the vineyard profitability. In the Brazilian southeast, the Royat system is the most suitable one to grow Chardonnay for sparkling wines production...|$|E
40|$|Vegetative growth, gas exchange, {{yield and}} berry {{characteristics}} of Cabernet Sauvignon vines (Vitis vinifera L.) grafted on Kober 5 BB and grown in pots under different soil water regimes were studied. Vines were trained on <b>Guyot</b> system (cane <b>pruning</b> 0. 30 m above the ground) and were grown in 45 -liter-pots containing an equal loam, sand and peat mix (1 : 1 : 1 in volume) and irrigated by drippers. Three different water regimes were imposed: 100 %, 50 % and 25 % of transpiration water evaluated each ninth day by pot weight. Each third day, vine water losses by plant transpiration were fully re-intregrated for the 100 % treatment, whereas it was one-half and one-fourth of transpiration water for 50 % and 25 % treatments respectively. The {{aim of this}} work {{was to investigate the}} effect of water regime on vegetative and reproductive growth and carbon partitioning in young container-grown vines. Both vegetative growth and gas exchange were affected by vine water status. Vine total dry matter resulted proportionally related to the water regime, the values obtained for the three treatments being significantly different. Results showed that water regime may affect yield per vine and berry size, according to previous studies. The analysis of berry composition pointed out the enhanced sugar accumulation in the case of full reintegration of transpiration water (100 % treatment). The organic acid component was also proportionally increased as the soil water content was higher. The components of fruit quality were directly affected by vine water status...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{nutritional}} diagnosis requires {{specific reference}} levels for each grape variety to effectively reflect the nutritional {{status of the}} crop. A vine nutritional survey was undertaken in the Rioja A. O. C., northeastern Spain. The survey method was used to establish the preliminary norms {{in the application of}} the Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) to the nutritional diagnosis of leaf blade and petiole tissues of Vitis vinifera L., cv. Tempranillo, on Richter- 110 rootstock. These DRIS norms were generated from data obtained during the course of 11 years (2000 ¿ 10) from 166 vineyards trained on both Gobelet and Vertical Shoot Position (VSP) <b>pruned</b> <b>Guyot</b> and Double Cordon Royat systems. The database obtained includes information from different altitudes, soil types, cultural practices, and climatic conditions within the Rioja appellation. The majority of the vineyards had no irrigation and soil was tilled mechanically. Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium were analyzed in leaf blade and petiole dry tissues sampled at both flowering and veraison. Vineyards with phytosanitary damages or flowering problems were discarded. Ratios among nutrients were established for the blade and petiole at both flowering and veraison by comparing two subpopulations of high and low quality. Both subpopulations were selected from a limited production criteria by a Student¿s t-test mean comparison. Finally, DRIS norms for leaf blade and petiole at both flowering and veraison are proposed for the nutrition diagnosis of the cv. Tempranillo in the Rioja A. O. C. This study was supported by the National Institute of Agricultural Research (Spain), the European Social Fund, and by the Regional Government of La Rioja (Spain), including Projects INIA-SC 00 - 016, PR- 01 - 03, PR- 01 - 04, and PR- 03 - 05, among others.

40|$|High-altitude {{regions of}} {{southern}} Brazil, located above 900 m above sea level, the cordon training with spur pruning {{is widely used}} because of easier application. In these regions, Chardonnay wine grape shows potential to produce quality wines, however, in commercial vineyards, the training system used has not provided productivities that makes economically viable the cultivation of this variety. Given this, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of different cane-pruning systems on the vegetative, productive and enological potential of Chardonnay grapevines grown in the high-altitude region of Southern Brazil. The experiment was conducted in a commercial Chardonnay vineyard, located in São Joaquim – Santa Catarina State (28 o 17 ′ 39 ”S and 49 ∘ 55 ′ 56 ” W, to 1230 [*]m a. s. l) during 2015 and 2016 vintages. Chardonnay vines (grafted on 1103 Paulsen) were planted in 2010, with a 3. 0 [*]m (row) × 1. 0 [*]m (vine) spacing. The treatments consisted of different cane-pruning systems: Cordon spur-pruning (control); Sylvoz; Cazenave; Capovolto; single Guyot and double <b>Guyot.</b> <b>Pruning</b> was performed in August of each year when the buds were in the green tip developmental stage. Data was analyzed by Scott Knott test (p < 0. 05) following a randomized block design with four replicates, each consisting of 12 vines per plot. We observed higher yield in the Cazenave and double Guyot training system with three and two more tons of grapes than spur-pruning respectively. The bud fertility was higher in plants trained in double Guyot. Vines spur-pruned showed higher relation of leaf area: production, with values above 100 [*]cm 2 g− 1 grape at 2016 vintage. Commercial maturity of grapes (soluble solids, acidity and polyphenols) did not differ among training systems studied. The results suggest that cane-pruning systems could be an alternative to increase production efficiency of Chardonnay in high-altitude region of southern Brazil...|$|E
