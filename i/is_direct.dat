5|$|Known {{from several}} well-preserved skulls and {{abundant}} skeletal material, Majungasaurus has recently {{become one of}} the best-studied theropod dinosaurs from the Southern Hemisphere. It appears to be most closely related to abelisaurids from India rather than South America or continental Africa, a fact that has important biogeographical implications. Majungasaurus was the apex predator in its ecosystem, mainly preying on sauropods like Rapetosaurus, and {{is also one of the}} few dinosaurs for which there <b>is</b> <b>direct</b> evidence of cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|Many {{wind power}} {{companies}} work with local communities to reduce environmental and other concerns associated with particular wind farms. In other cases there <b>is</b> <b>direct</b> community ownership of wind farm projects. Appropriate government consultation, planning and approval procedures {{also help to}} minimize environmental risks. Some may still object to wind farms but, according to The Australia Institute, their concerns should be weighed against the {{need to address the}} threats posed by climate change and the opinions of the broader community.|$|E

5|$|The {{budget of}} the city for 2013 was €7.6 billion, of which €5.4 billion went for city administration, while €2.2 billion went for investment. The largest part of the budget (38 percent) went for public housing and urbanism projects; 15 percent for roads and transport; 8 percent for schools (which are mostly financed by the state budget); 5 percent for parks and gardens; and 4 percent for culture. The main {{source of income for}} the city <b>is</b> <b>direct</b> taxes (35 percent), {{supplemented}} by a 13-percent real estate tax; 19 percent of the budget comes in a transfer from the national government.|$|E
5|$|Development of the fertilized eggs <b>is</b> <b>direct,</b> {{in other}} words there is no {{distinctive}} larval form. Juveniles of all groups are generally planktonic, and in most species resemble miniature adult cydippids, gradually developing their adult body forms as they grow. In the genus Beroe, however, the juveniles have large mouths and, like the adults, lack both tentacles and tentacle sheaths, and in some groups, such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the juveniles behave more like true larvae, as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents, and only attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis after dropping to the sea-floor.|$|E

5|$|The {{debate among}} monks unfolds in the {{presence}} of their teachers, with a very well set rules of procedure for the defender and the questioners. The tradition of such debates is traced to the ancient ‘Hindu Orthodoxy’ in India and this practice permeated into Buddhist orthodoxy in Tibet in the eighth century. Such debates usually take place within the monastery’s precincts. The defender has the onus to prove his point of view on the subject proposed for debate. The debate opens with an invocation to Manjushri recited in a loud and high pitched tone. The roles of the debater and the questioner are well defined; the questioner has to succinctly present his case (all on Buddhism related topics) and the defender has to answer within a fixed time frame. The finality of the debate is with specific answers like: “I accept (do), the reason is not established (ta madrup) or there is no pervasion (Kyappa majung)”. Many a time, the questions mooted are meant to mislead the defender. If the defender does not reply within a time frame, an expression of derision is witnessed. In the Tibetan debating sessions, there is no role for a witness and there is normally no adjudicator. This leads to “conflicting opinions of participants and listeners.” When there <b>is</b> <b>direct</b> contradiction on the defenders part, the outcome is, however, formally decided.|$|E
