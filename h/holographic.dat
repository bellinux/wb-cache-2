5|$|Dennis Haysbert as General Hologram, a <b>holographic</b> {{general in}} Hero's Duty.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, several {{independent}} {{groups of}} experimenters in the mid-60s {{realized that the}} fringes encoded important information about dimensional changes occurring in the subject, and began intentionally producing <b>holographic</b> double exposures. The main <b>Holographic</b> interferometry article covers the disputes over priority of discovery {{that occurred during the}} issuance of the patent for this method.|$|E
5|$|<b>Holographic</b> {{interferometry}} {{was discovered}} by accident {{as a result of}} mistakes committed during the making of holograms. Early lasers were relatively weak and photographic plates were insensitive, necessitating long exposures during which vibrations or minute shifts might occur in the optical system. The resultant holograms, which showed the <b>holographic</b> subject covered with fringes, were considered ruined.|$|E
5|$|<b>Holographic</b> weapon sights {{are similar}} in layout to {{reflector}} sights but do not use a projected reticle system. Instead, a representative reticle is recorded in three-dimensional space onto <b>holographic</b> film {{at the time of}} manufacture. This image is part of the optical viewing window. The recorded hologram is illuminated by a collimated laser built into the sight. The sight can be adjusted for range and windage by simply tilting or pivoting the optical window.|$|E
5|$|In November 2005 Allingham {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} the International <b>Holographic</b> Portrait Archive to have his <b>holographic</b> portrait taken. His image was recorded for posterity in December 2005. At the same time, an exhibition was being planned for London's floating naval museum on board HMS Belfast, entitled the Ghosts of Jutland. A copy of this portrait was donated to the museum and HRH The Duchess of Gloucester unveiled the portrait to mark {{the opening of the}} exhibition.|$|E
5|$|James Darren as Vic Fontaine, a <b>holographic</b> entertainer.|$|E
5|$|Cortana's {{original}} design {{was based on}} the Egyptian queen Nefertiti; the character's <b>holographic</b> representation always {{takes the form of a}} woman. Bungie first introduced Cortana—and Halo—through the Cortana Letters, emails sent during Combat Evolveds production in 1999. Since then, the character has been used extensively to advertise the series. Cortana has been recognized for her believability and character depth, and her <b>holographic</b> representation has been noted for its sex appeal. The character was the inspiration for Microsoft's intelligent personal assistant.|$|E
5|$|Counterfeit {{copies of}} cards issued by {{legitimate}} publications can be made. Issuers of cards have taken measures to prevent counterfeiting of their cards, creating cards with <b>holographic</b> foil blocking, signature strips, and tamper-resistant lamination.|$|E
5|$|<b>Holographic</b> {{interferometry}} is {{a technique}} which uses holography to monitor small deformations in single wavelength implementations. In multi-wavelength implementations, {{it is used to}} perform dimensional metrology of large parts and assemblies and to detect larger surface defects.|$|E
5|$|Later, in 1993, Gerard 't Hooft wrote a {{speculative}} {{paper on}} quantum gravity {{in which he}} revisited Hawking's work on black hole thermodynamics, concluding that {{the total number of}} degrees of freedom in a region of spacetime surrounding a black hole is proportional to the surface area of the horizon. This idea was promoted by Leonard Susskind and is now known as the <b>holographic</b> principle. The <b>holographic</b> principle and its realization in string theory through the AdS/CFT correspondence have helped elucidate the mysteries of black holes suggested by Hawking's work and are believed to provide a resolution of the black hole information paradox. In 2004, Hawking conceded that black holes do not violate quantum mechanics, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which they might preserve information.|$|E
5|$|Madeline Carroll as White Queen: The sister {{computer}} of {{the original}} Red Queen. She is designed to protect and preserve human life and monitor the Umbrella facility, like her sister computer. However, the White Queen has more advanced <b>holographic</b> technology.|$|E
5|$|Shards of Alara also debuted mythic rares (red-orange), which replace one {{in eight}} rare cards on average. There are also premium {{versions}} of every card with <b>holographic</b> foil, randomly inserted into some boosters {{in place of}} a common, which replace about one in seventy cards.|$|E
5|$|The episode shows Pearl {{attempting}} to teach Steven {{the art of}} sword-fighting using Holo Pearl, a <b>holographic</b> version of herself. However, during the lessons, Pearl gets injured and retreats into her gem to heal and make a new body to project.|$|E
5|$|An {{updated version}} of the {{original}} film, titled , was made in celebration {{for the release of}} The Sky Crawlers in 2008. The Ghost in the Shell 2.0 release features replacements of the original animations with the latest digital film and animation technologies, such as 3D-CGI. It includes a new opening, digital screens and <b>holographic</b> displays, and omits several brief scenes.|$|E
5|$|Double- and multi- {{exposure}} holography is one {{of three}} methods used to create <b>holographic</b> interferograms. A first exposure records the object in an unstressed state. Subsequent exposures on the same photographic plate are made while the object is subjected to some stress. The composite image depicts the difference between the stressed and unstressed states.|$|E
5|$|Electronic {{speckle pattern}} {{interferometry}} (ESPI), {{also known as}} TV holography, uses video detection and recording to produce {{an image of the}} object upon which is superimposed a fringe pattern which represents the displacement of the object between recordings. (see Fig.21) The fringes are similar to those obtained in <b>holographic</b> interferometry.|$|E
5|$|ILM created 527 {{shots for}} the film, using {{programs}} such as Maya. Perception worked on over 125 shots for the film. They crafted gadgets, such as Tony Stark's transparent LG smartphone, and created the backdrops for the Stark Expo {{as well as the}} computer screen interfaces on the touch-screen coffee table and the <b>holographic</b> lab environment. In total, 11 visual effect studios worked on the film.|$|E
5|$|In The Biggest Secret (1999), he {{introduced}} {{the idea that}} many prominent figures derive from the Anunnaki, a reptilian race from the Draco constellation. In Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More (2012), he identified the Moon (and later Saturn) {{as the source of}} <b>holographic</b> experiences, broadcast by the reptiles, that humanity interprets as reality.|$|E
5|$|Jason O'Mara as Albert Wesker: Based on {{the video}} game {{character}} of the same name. In the film, he is the Chairman of Umbrella, and through <b>holographic</b> technology (him being in Tokyo), he has regular meetings with committee members including Dr. Isaacs who gave the order to find and capture Alice.|$|E
5|$|Real-time {{holography}} is {{a second}} method of creating <b>holographic</b> interferograms. A holograph of the unstressed object is created. This holograph is illuminated with a reference beam to generate a hologram image of the object directly superimposed over the original object itself while the object is being subjected to some stress. The object waves from this hologram image will interfere with new waves coming from the object. This technique allows real time monitoring of shape changes.|$|E
5|$|The $50000 {{denomination}} was {{the first}} denomination to use the Optically Variable Ink technique, on the value positioned at the top right of the obverse. The $750000 denomination of the December 2007 series was the only note out of all cheques of the second dollar to bear a <b>holographic</b> strip, as the cheque was printed on paper that was prepared for the 1000ZWD notes (Pick No. 12).|$|E
5|$|The duality {{represents}} a major advance {{in our understanding}} of string theory and quantum gravity. This is because it provides a non-perturbative formulation of string theory with certain boundary conditions and because it is the most successful realization of the <b>holographic</b> principle, an idea in quantum gravity originally proposed by Gerard 't Hooft and promoted by Leonard Susskind.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s, the {{telescope}} surface was becoming badly corroded. In 2001–2003, {{the telescope}} was resurfaced, increasing its sensitivity at 5GHz {{by a factor}} of five. A <b>holographic</b> profiling technique was used on the surface, meaning that the surface works optimally at wavelengths of 5cm (compared to 18cm on the old surface). A new drive system was installed, which provides a much higher pointing accuracy. The outer track was relaid, and the focal tower was strengthened so that it could support heavier receivers.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Union Bank of Switzerland {{acquired}} an 80% stake in Argor SA, a Swiss precious metals refinery founded in 1951 in the canton of Ticino. In 1973, the bank increased the stake to full 100% ownership, though the ownership was ultimately sold between 1986 and 1999 to Argor-Heraeus SA. UBS continues to issue gold bars via Argor-Heraeus which {{is famous for}} the unique kinebar <b>holographic</b> technology it uses to provide enhanced protection against bank gold bar counterfeiting.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these bank acquisitions, UBS also acquired an 80% stake in Argor SA, a Swiss precious metal refinery founded in 1951, through whom they started to issue UBS branded gold bars. In 1973, the bank increased the stake to full 100% ownership only to withdraw by 1999 with ownership of the refinery changing to Hereaus & Management. Nevertheless, UBS continues to issue gold bars via Argor-Heraeus which is famous for the unique kinebar <b>holographic</b> technology it uses to provide enhanced protection against bank gold bar counterfeiting.|$|E
5|$|In the Canadian Armed Forces and Royal Canadian Mounted Police, {{the most}} senior non-commissioned ranks wear the 1957 version of the coat of arms as a badge of rank, {{representing}} {{the fact that they}} have received the Queen's warrant (as opposed |to the Queen's commission for officers). The revised 1957 and 1994 Arms of Canada are both protected official government symbols used to represent the state under the Federal Identity Program. Permanent resident cards issued from 2015 feature a <b>holographic</b> representation of the 1957 version of the coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|Mega Man is sent by his creator, Dr. Light, {{to defeat}} Dr. Wily and his Robot Masters. Mega Man crushes the eight new Robot Masters and then {{challenges}} Wily himself. During the final fight, Dr. Wily flees into the caves beneath his fortress and when Mega Man follows, attempts to trick Mega Man into thinking he is a space alien, but Mega Man defeats the alien revealing {{it to be}} a <b>holographic</b> projection device which malfunctions showing Dr. Wily at the controls. After the scientist begs for mercy, Mega Man spares Wily and returns home.|$|E
5|$|Notably, {{the comic}} strip stories' <b>holographic</b> characters, predominately Rimmer, were drawn in grayscale. This was {{at the request of}} Grant and Naylor, who had wanted to use the {{technique}} for the television series, but the process was deemed too expensive to produce. Despite achieving circulation figures of over 40,000 per month, the magazine's publisher decided to close the title down to concentrate on their other publications. A farewell issue was published, cover dated January 1994, and featured the remaining interviews, features, and comic strips that were to feature in the following issues.|$|E
5|$|Released in 1981, Asteroids Deluxe is {{the first}} sequel to Asteroids. Dave Shepperd edited the code and made {{enhancements}} to the game without Logg's involvement. The onscreen objects were tinted blue, and hyperspace {{was replaced by a}} shield that depleted if used. The asteroids rotate, and the added killer satellite enemy breaks apart into three smaller ships when hit that home in on the player's position. The arcade machine's monitor displays vector graphics overlaying a <b>holographic</b> backdrop. The game is much harder than the original and does not allow saucers to be hunteda common strategy for Asteroids high scores.|$|E
5|$|Convinced of Barclay's claims, the Doctor {{prepares to}} destroy the ship when Chakotay (Robert Beltran) arrives and gives an {{alternative}} story: The Doctor is indeed the Voyager EMH, but his program is stuck in the malfunctioning holodeck. The crew is trying to extricate his program so he only needs to wait it out; if he destroys the ship as Barclay suggests, it will prematurely end {{the program and the}} Doctor will be lost. Even though Barclay introduces Kes (Jennifer Lien) as Zimmerman's wife, the Doctor finally opts to believe in his <b>holographic</b> existence. The simulation ends and the Doctor finds himself on the holodeck; Chakotay's story was true and the Doctor is safely returned to sickbay.|$|E
5|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote sensing. Satellite {{synthetic aperture}} radar images of a geographic feature are taken on separate days, and changes {{that have taken place}} between radar images taken on the separate days are recorded as fringes similar to those obtained in <b>holographic</b> interferometry. The technique can monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in structural engineering, in particular for the monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. Fig20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.|$|E
5|$|One {{special case}} of Maldacena's {{proposal}} says that N=4 super Yang–Mills theory, a gauge theory similar {{in some ways}} to quantum chromodynamics, is equivalent to string theory in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. This result helped clarify the earlier work of 't Hooft on the relationship between string theory and quantum chromodynamics, taking string theory back to its roots as a theory of nuclear physics. Maldacena's results also provided a concrete realization of the <b>holographic</b> principle with important implications for quantum gravity and black hole physics. By the year 2015, Maldacena's paper had become the most highly cited paper in high energy physics with over 10,000 citations. These subsequent articles have provided considerable evidence that the correspondence is correct, although so far it has not been rigorously proved.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 {{banknote}} series was {{prepared by the}} Reserve Bank in October 2006 for the abandoned second phase of Operation Sunrise. The Chiremba Balancing Rocks was to be reinstated as the main feature on the obverse whilst use of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark continued. There were additional security features as opposed to previous issues, which included security threads, see-through register marks and recognition marks for the partially sighted. <b>Holographic</b> security threads and Optically Variable Ink were used on the $100, $500 and $1000 notes. When the redenomination of 1 August 2008 occurred these notes were put into circulation as banknotes of the third dollar between 1 August 2008 to 31 December 2008.|$|E
5|$|The LS 400 {{was among}} the first luxury sedans to feature an {{automatic}} tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with SRS airbag, power adjustable shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic rear-view mirror. The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electro-luminescent gauge cluster featured a <b>holographic</b> visual effect, with indicator lights projected onto the instrument panel. The memory system stored the driver's seat, side mirror, steering wheel, and seat belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands-free capabilities. The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence, including fluid-damped cabin fixtures, vibration-insulating rubber mounts, airflow fairings, and sandwich steel body panels.|$|E
5|$|The main {{collectibles}} {{available in}} Pokémon Channel are trading cards that display various Pokémon. The trading cards, known in game as Nice Cards, exist in three forms: Single, which simply show a picture; Motion, which are holographic; and Platinum, which are <b>holographic</b> {{and play the}} respective Pokémon's cries. The collectibles can be found by having Pikachu speak with other Pokémon and help them with tasks, or by ordering from Shop 'n Squirtle. There is a virtual Pokémon Mini console hidden under the player's bed that plays six games: Snorlax's Lunch Time (exclusive to Pokémon Channel) and five others previously released for the real-life Pokémon Mini. The games are simple and mainly based on rhythm.|$|E
5|$|The stunt {{crew was}} the same one used in Cruise's Mission: Impossible 2, and was {{responsible}} for complex action scenes. These included the auto factory chase scene, filmed in a real facility using props such as a welding robot, and the fight between Anderton and the jetpack-clad officers, filmed in an alley set built on the Warner Bros. studio lot. Industrial Light & Magic {{did most of the}} special effects, and DreamWorks-owned PDI was responsible for the Spyder robots. The company Pixel Liberation Front did previsualization animatics. The <b>holographic</b> projections and the prison facility were filmed by several roving cameras which surrounded the actors, and the scene where Anderton gets off his car and runs along the Maglev vehicles was filmed on stationary props, which were later replaced by computer-generated vehicles.|$|E
