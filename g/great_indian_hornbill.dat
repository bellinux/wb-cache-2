25|$|About {{one-sixth of}} Nagaland {{is covered by}} {{tropical}} and sub-tropical evergreen forests—including palms, bamboo, rattan as well as timber and mahogany forests. While some forest areas have been cleared for jhum cultivation, many scrub forests, high grass, reeds; secondary dogs, pangolins, porcupines, elephants, leopards, bears, many species of monkeys, sambar, harts, oxen, and buffaloes thrive across the state's forests. The <b>great</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>hornbill</b> {{is one of the}} most famous birds found in the state. Blyth's tragopan, a vulnerable species of pheasant, is the state bird of Nagaland. It is sighted in Mount Japfü and Dzükou Valley of Kohima district, Satoi range in Zunheboto district and Pfütsero in Phek district. Of the mere 2500 tragopans sighted in the world, Dzükou valley is the natural habitat of more than 1,000.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, Nyishi plait {{their hair}} and tie it neatly at the {{forehead}} with Tibetan thread. A brass skewer passes horizontally through the tied hair. Cane rings were worn around the waist, arms and legs. Men wore a cane helmet surmounted with the beak of the <b>great</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>hornbill.</b> The usage of actual hornbill beaks is discouraged these days due to tough wildlife protection laws since the <b>great</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>hornbill</b> is a protected species and generally due to growing awareness among the people as well. Nowadays It is being supplemented by beaks made of cane or other materials and the entire headgear/cane helmet itself is readily available {{in the market for}} purchase. Additional decorations varied depending upon the status of the person and were symbols of manly valor.|$|E

50|$|The final {{programme}} looks at India's dwindling rainforests, now {{confined to the}} Western Ghats, upper Assam and Sri Lanka. The once extensive forests have been decimated by logging, firewood collection and hunting. In the opening scene, Valmik Thapar tracks lion-tailed macaques in southern India, a very rare fruit and seed eating monkey. In the Western Ghats, there are 120 species of amphibian, including flying frogs. Invertebrates use colour for camouflage, warning and defence, but mantises and crickets still fall prey to slow-moving chameleons. A faster reptile, the flying lizard, is shown gliding from tree to tree. Also filmed is the ancient practice of collecting honey from wild bees' nests high in the canopy. Birds visiting a fruiting fig tree include <b>great</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>hornbills,</b> Malabar grey hornbills, blossom-headed parakeets and fairy bluebirds. Mammals are also attracted by the fruit: Nilgiri langurs, bonnet macaques and Malabar giant squirrels. On the forest floor, wild boar and barking deer feed on the rejected figs, drawing a prowling leopard. Monkeys spot the danger and raise the alarm. The many varieties of fig tree provide food year-round for all these animals. Each fig is pollinated by a particular species of wasp, which lay their eggs in the fruits. Thapar visits the world's largest fig, a sacred banyan tree that draw pilgrims from far and wide. In the hill forests of southern India, Thapar tracks Nilgiri tahr on the grassy peaks. Here, the rains last for 6 months, creating huge waterfalls. The Sinharaja forest of Sri Lanka has more unique species than anywhere else on the subcontinent, including dozens of kinds of jumping spiders, each with their own courtship signals. A tiger is filmed stalking a rutting gaur herd. Gaur are the world's biggest cattle {{but they have been}} known to fall prey to tigers. The program ends on a sober note, filming elephants crossing tea plantations where forests once stood. The problem elephants are caught and trained as working animals. A wild calf is shown being caught by lasso. The distressed animal is broken by torture, but it is also worshipped: one of the paradoxes of the subcontinent.|$|R

50|$|The great {{hornbill}} (Buceros bicornis) {{also known as}} the <b>great</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>hornbill</b> or great pied hornbill, is one of the larger members of the hornbill family. It is found in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Its impressive size and colour have made it important in many tribal cultures and rituals. The {{great hornbill}} is long-lived, living for nearly 50 years in captivity. It is predominantly frugivorous, but is an opportunist and will prey on small mammals, reptiles and birds.|$|E
50|$|Rare great Indian {{hornbills}} {{are found}} here. The <b>great</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>hornbill</b> {{is one of}} the largest hornbills and these are found from sea level up to 5000 ft. Great Indian hornbills like to eat various types of berries. Hornbills swallow most of their food whole instead of breaking it down first. Hornbills are famous for their nesting ritual. They are becoming rare, mainly due to their hunting for their meat and destruction of their habitat. Protection and restoration of destroyed forest areas will aid the conservation of hornbills in the region.|$|E
