25|$|<b>Foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> <b>virus</b> (FMDV) is {{a member}} of the Aphthovirus genus in the Picornaviridae family and is the cause of foot-and-mouth disease in pigs, cattle, sheep and goats.

Sea urchins are being used in longevity studies for comparison between the young and old of the species, particularly {{for their ability to}} regenerate tissue as needed. Scientists at the University of St Andrews have discovered a genetic sequence, the '2A' region, in sea urchins previously thought to have belonged only to viruses that afflict humans like <b>Foot-and-Mouth</b> <b>Disease</b> <b>Virus.</b> Oceanography has taken in interest in monitoring the health of urchins and their populations as a way to assess overall ocean acidification, temperatures, and ecological impact studies.|$|E
25|$|In 1897, <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> <b>virus</b> (FMDV), {{the first}} animal virus, was discovered. FMDV is the prototypic {{member of the}} Aphthovirus genus in the Picornaviridae family. The plaque assay was {{developed}} using poliovirus; the discovery of viral replication in culture was also with poliovirus in 1949. This {{was the first time}} that infection virus had been produced from molecular building blocks in the cells. Polyprotein synthesis, internal ribosome entry sites, and uncapped mRNA were all discovered by studying poliovirus infected cells, and a poliovirus clone was the first infectious DNA clone made of an RNA virus in animals. Along with rhinovirus, poliovirus was the first animal virus to have its structure determined by x-ray crystallography. RNA dependent RNA polymerase was discovered in Mengovirus, a genus of picornaviruses.|$|E

The three serotypes differed from one another by more than 40 % while intratypic variation did not exceed 29 %. Within each type, isolates from particular countries were more closely related to one another than to isolates from other countries lending credence to previous observations that FMDV evolve independently in different regions of the subcontinent...|$|R

2500|$|The {{incubation}} period for <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> <b>virus</b> has a range {{between one and}} 12 days. The disease is characterized by high fever that declines rapidly {{after two or three}} days, blisters inside the mouth that lead to excessive secretion of stringy or foamy saliva and to drooling, and blisters on the feet that may rupture and cause lameness. [...] Adult animals may suffer weight loss from which they do not recover for several months, as well as swelling in the testicles of mature males, and in cows, milk production can decline significantly. [...] Though most animals eventually recover from FMD, the disease can lead to myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and death, especially in newborn animals. [...] Some infected ruminants remain asymptomatic carriers, but they nonetheless carry FMDV and may be able to transmit it to others. Pigs cannot serve as asymptomatic carriers.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{prisoners were}} forced to work, some refused, which led to severe penalties, going up to prison terms of a year. Cases of “sabotage” were also reported, principally in factories, but also on farms. In Roger Pelletier’s memoirs, there is an account of French prisoners {{suspected}} of having placed bits of iron into a crusher (of grains or beets) in order to damage it. Some acts of sabotage were more radical, above all a scheme involving the procurement of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> <b>virus</b> in order to decimate German livestock. However, the attitude most often adopted (and also the safest) was to work as little as possible. Since their labour was forced, the detainees did not expend all their effort on the enemy: “We worked with a certain constancy and a minimum of effort." [...] The prisoners, although they {{contributed significantly to the}} German war effort, might also be considered as burdens due to their lack of qualifications or their unsuitability as workers on behalf of the enemy. For example, an imprisoned bureaucrat finding himself working in a field gave less results than if a civilian farmer had been given the work.|$|E
40|$|Two-dimensional quantal microneutralization {{tests on}} <b>foot-and-mouth</b> <b>disease</b> <b>viruses,</b> in which {{neutralizing}} antibody activity was titrated against a serial range of virus doses, demonstrated {{a variety of}} dose-response curves {{some of which were}} rectilinear, others clearly curvilinear. Moreover, {{in the case of the}} non-linear responses obtained with some antisera, the shape of the curve was such that antibody titres recorded with doses of virus ranging from 10 (3) - 10 (5) TCD 50 were closely similar. Studies were carried out on the effect of varying the conditions of the test on the shape of the dose-response curve: significant differences were obtained after treatment of the antiserum-virus mixtures with anti-species globulin, and when the test was assayed in cells of differing susceptibility to infection...|$|R

50|$|Aphthovirus (from the Greek aphtha-, vesicles in the mouth) is a viral genus of {{the family}} Picornaviridae.
