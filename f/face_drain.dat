40|$|A joint {{investigation}} by the Bureau of Mines and the Christopher Coal Co. at the Humphrey No. 7 mine, operating in the Pittsburgh coalbed in northern West Virginia, was undertaken to gain more insight concerning the hazardous emission of methane gas in mining. This report describes the equipment, procedure, and results. Horizontal bleeder holes drilled in the <b>faces</b> <b>drained</b> large quantities of methane, eliminating downtime of mining equipment. Also, larger quantities of methane were removed by forcing 14 to 25 g,. p. m. water at 25 to 200 p. s. i. 5 pressure into the bleeder holes. In one infusion test a fluorescein dye {{was added to the}} infusion water; in later mining operations, the infusion water was traced for a distance of 1, 500 feet. With vacuum pump applied to the horizontal hole the gas-flow rate increased, and the methane content decreased. Tests indicated that methane and water infused in bleeder holes traveled along the bedding planes of the Pittsburgh coalbed at a faster rate than across the planes. Methane associated with coalbeds is produced by the slow decomposition of carbonaceous material in the absence of air and the presence of water. It is lighter than air and, depending on its concentration, forms an inflammable or explosive mixture with air. It is believed that methane is entrapped in and around the pores of the coal and adjacent strata [...] often under great pressure. In many cases where the strata have been disturbed by geologic movements th...|$|R

40|$|Estimates of bedrock {{infiltration}} from mountain catchments in {{the western}} U. S. are essential to water resource managers because they provide an estimate of mountain block recharge to regional aquifers. On smaller scales, bedrock infiltration is an important term in water mass balance studies, which attempt to estimate hydrologic states and fluxes in watersheds with fractured or transmissive bedrock. We estimate the a daily time series of bedrock infiltration in a small catchment in the rain snow transition zone in southwest Idaho, using the difference between measured stream discharge and modeled soil drainage. The accuracy of spatial patterns in soil water storage are optimized, rather than the more common approach of minimizing error in integrated quantities such as streamflow. Bedrock infiltration {{is estimated to be}} 289 mm ± 50 mm for the 2011 water year, which is 34 % ± 12 % of the precipitation (95 % confidence).

40|$|Introduction: This {{qualitative}} study aimed to describe Kenyan medical doctors’ experiences during their prior to, during, and after their deployment in West Africa during the 2014 / 2015 Ebola epidemic. Methods: Snowball sampling {{was used in}} July 2016 to recruit 6 Kenyan medical doctors who had recently returned from West Africa. In-depth interviews based on an interview guide were conducted to collect data. Findings: Respondents volunteered as part of career development {{and out of a}} sense of ethical responsibility. Prior to deployment, most experienced doubt about their safety and feared infection with Ebola. Their decisions were often questioned by their families, friends, and colleagues. On arrival, they experienced more fear of infection, encountered adverse weather, and were thrust into a rigorous pre-service schedule. Respondents were surprised at how underdeveloped the infrastructure was, how weak the health systems were, and they were often exasperated by the lack of basic resources. They <b>faced</b> emotionally <b>draining</b> situations, struggled to cope with intense work schedules, found leadership tasks and coordination of multi-cultural teams very challenging, and encountered many risky situations. Accountability for their welfare was not always clear. Conclusion: The volunteers were sub-optimally prepared and their psychosocial needs were not adequately met. However, they were still able to perform their duties perhaps partly because of their prior experiences working in resource-limited settings. The welfare of volunteers recruited is of utmost importance especially when the workers recruited have to take up high-risk deployments.

40|$|The {{glutamate}}-glutamine cycle <b>faces</b> a <b>drain</b> of glutamate by oxidation, {{which is}} {{balanced by the}} anaplerotic synthesis of glutamate and glutamine in astrocytes. De novo synthesis of glutamate by astrocytes requires an amino group whose origin is unknown. The deficiency in Aralar/AGC 1, the main mitochondrial carrier for aspartate-glutamate expressed in brain, results in a drastic fall in brain glutamine production but a modest decrease in brain glutamate levels, which is not due to decreases in neuronal or synaptosomal glutamate content. In vivo 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance labeling with 13 C 2 acetate or (1 - 13 C) glucose showed that the drop in brain glutamine {{is due to a}} failure in glial glutamate synthesis. Aralar deficiency induces a decrease in aspartate content, an increase in lactate production, and lactate-to-pyruvate ratio in cultured neurons but not in cultured astrocytes, indicating that Aralar is only functional in neurons. We find that aspartate, but not other amino acids, increases glutamate synthesis in both control and aralar-deficient astrocytes, mainly by serving as amino donor. These findings suggest the existence of a neuron-to-astrocyte aspartate transcellular pathway required for astrocyte glutamate synthesis and subsequent glutamine formation. This pathway may provide a mechanism to transfer neuronal-born redox equivalents to mitochondria in astrocytes. © 2011 ISCBFM All rights reserved.

40|$|Deep {{percolation}} (DP) {{is estimated}} {{from a small}} study catchment in the semi arid rain-snow transition zone in the foothills north of Boise, ID. A water balance is performed at the catchment soil bedrock interface, where soil drainage {{is assumed to be}} partitioned into DP and streamflow. While stream flow is measured, soil drainage must be estimated. We model the snow dynamics and surface water inputs (SWI) to the soil (Chapter 3), and the soil dynamics and soil drainage to the soil-bedrock interface (Chapter 4). The high spatiotemporal dataset used in this modeling effort is presented for the 2011 water year, which includes weather, topographic, vegetation, and soils data (Chapter 1). The image SNOw and mass BALance model is used to predict the distributed surface water inputs at a 2. 5 m 2 resolution. Southwest facing slopes receive smaller and more frequent SWI from mid winter snowmelt, while the northeast slope receives more SWI during the spring. Rain on snow events produce similar SWI between slopes. Turbulent fluxes dominated the snowpack energetics in four of the five rain-on-snow events. Advective fluxes are greater than 17 % during the 2 rain-on-snow events in December and January. Net radiation fluxes dominate spring melt events. Variations in the method used to distribute precipitation may result in large differences in total precipitation to the basin. The Soil Ecohydraulic Model is used to predict soil drainage at 57 points across the catchment. Soils on the southwest <b>facing</b> slope <b>drain</b> more often throughout the water year, but the northeast facing slope contributes a greater total magnitude of soil drainage. Peaks in catchment soil drainage and deep percolation coincide with rain on snow events. Deep percolation is estimated to be 272 mm ± 34 mm for the 2011 water year, which is 29 % ± 4 % of the precipitation. In summary, we provide a high temporal and spatial data set from a catchment in the rain snow transition zone in Chapter 2. This dataset provides a) soil, vegetation, and weather data to parameterize and drive hydrologic models, and b) snow and hydrologic response data to validate hydrologic models. The data is used to run a physically based snow accumulation and melt model, from which we obtain a high spatial and temporal resolution data set of surface water inputs to the catchment in Chapter 3.
