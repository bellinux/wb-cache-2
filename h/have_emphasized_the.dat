5|$|Christian {{meditation}} aims {{to heighten}} the personal relationship {{based on the}} love of God that marks Christian communion. Both in Eastern and Western Christianity meditation is the middle level in a broad three-stage characterization of prayer: it involves more reflection than first level vocal prayer, but is more structured than the multiple layers of contemplative prayer. Teachings in both the Eastern and Western Christian churches <b>have</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> use of Christian meditation as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ.|$|E
5|$|While {{more recent}} critics <b>have</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> revolutionary {{aspects of the}} cross-class {{friendship}} between Jemima and Maria, others have questioned the extent of that radicalism, arguing that Jemima's story occupies a small section of the novel and is abruptly truncated. Mary Poovey also maintains that Wollstonecraft fails to extend her critique of marriage and society from the individual to the systemic level.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} saints and {{historical}} figures have followed and presented specific approaches to Christian meditation. Both Eastern and Western Christian teachings <b>have</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> use of meditation {{as an element}} in increasing one's knowledge of Christ. The Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola use meditative mental imagery, {{with the goal of}} knowing Christ more intimately and loving him more ardently. In The Way of Perfection, St. Theresa of Avila taught her nuns how to try to get to know Christ by using meditation and mental prayer. Hesychastic prayer and meditation continues {{to be used in the}} Eastern Orthodox tradition as a spiritual practice that facilitates the knowing of Christ.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} the visual dimension, {{distinction}} between aggressive mimicry and camouflage is not always clear. Authors such as Wickler <b>have</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> significance of the signal to its receiver as delineating mimicry from camouflage. However, {{it is not easy}} to assess how 'significant' a signal may be for the dupe, and the distinction between the two can thus be rather fuzzy. Mixed signals may also be employed. Aggressive mimics often have a specific part of the body sending a deceptive signal, with the rest being hidden or camouflaged.|$|E
5|$|It {{has long}} been a matter of debate why the Renaissance began in Florence, and not {{elsewhere}} in Italy. Scholars have noted several features unique to Florentine cultural life that may have caused such a cultural movement. Many <b>have</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> role played by the Medici, a banking family and later ducal ruling house, in patronizing and stimulating the arts. Lorenzo de' Medici (1449–1492) was the catalyst for an enormous amount of arts patronage, encouraging his countrymen to commission works from the leading artists of Florence, including Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, and Michelangelo Buonarroti. Works by Neri di Bicci, Botticelli, da Vinci and Filippino Lippi had been commissioned additionally by the convent di San Donato agli Scopeti of the Augustinians order in Florence.|$|E
5|$|Other {{groups in}} the British grindcore scene, such as Heresy and Unseen Terror, <b>have</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> {{influence}} of American hardcore punk, including Septic Death, as well as Swedish D-beat. Sore Throat cites Discharge, Disorder, {{and a variety of}} European D-beat and thrash metal groups, including Hellhammer, and American hardcore groups, such as Poison Idea and D.R.I.. Japanese hardcore, particularly GISM, is also mentioned by a number of originators of the style. Other key groups cited by current and former members of Napalm Death as formative influences include Discharge, Amebix, Throbbing Gristle, and the aforementioned Dirty Rotten Imbeciles. Post-punk, such as Killing Joke and Joy Division, was also cited as an influence on early Napalm Death.|$|E

5|$|Exponents of the universalist, anti-racist {{approach}} {{believe that}} the deities of Northern Europe can call anyone to their worship, regardless of ethnic background. This group rejects the folkish emphasis on race, believing that even if unintended, {{it can lead to}} the adoption of racist attitudes toward those of non-Northern European ancestry. Anti-racist practitioners such as Stephan Grundy <b>have</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> fact that ancient Northern Europeans were known to marry and have children with members of other ethnic groups, and that in Norse mythology the Æsir also did the same with Vanir, Jötun, and humans, thus using such points to critique the racialist view. Universalists welcome practitioners of Heathenry who are not of Northern European ancestry; for instance, there are Jewish and African American members of the U.S.-based Troth, while many of its white members are married to spouses from different racial groups. While sometimes retaining the idea of Heathenry as an indigenous religion, proponents of this view have sometimes argued that Heathenry is indigenous to the land of Northern Europe, rather than indigenous to any specific race.|$|E

25|$|Second, {{a clearer}} {{focus on the}} purpose itself–serving a {{specific}} customer or market–is enabled. On the other hand, the sense of independence {{may result in a}} drift-off from the achievement of the overall objectives of the organization. Therefore, several authors <b>have</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> need for establishing control systems that serve the purpose of allowing decentralized decisions, while still aligning all sub-units to the overall goals of the organization (Drucker 1954, Koontz & O’Donnell, 1964).|$|E
25|$|Complaining that {{mainstream}} academia was {{hostile to}} conservatives, several foundations became especially active in funding conservative policy research, notably the Adolph Coors Foundation, the Bradley Foundation, the Koch family foundations, the Scaife Foundations, and (until it closed in 2005), the John M. Olin Foundation. Typically, they <b>have</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> need for market-based solutions to national problems. The foundations often invested in conservative student publications and organizations, {{such as the}} Intercollegiate Studies Institute and legal foundations such as the Federalist Society.|$|E
25|$|Performance appraisals present two strong {{benefits}} for organizations. First, reviewing an employee's performance {{in his or}} her responsibilities helps employers keep a consistent record of professional developments and recognize ways to improve an employee's productivity. Second, appraisals enable the relationships between managers, supervisors and their employees, to be based on open communication and consistent constructive criticism. As a result, many managers <b>have</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> value of using different performance measurement systems based on either financial and operational measures of performance.|$|E
50|$|Watten's & Grenier's {{magazine}} This (and This Press which Watten edited), {{along with}} the magazine L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, published work by notable Black Mountain poets such as Robert Creeley and Larry Eigner. Silliman considers Language poetry to be a continuation (albeit incorporating a critique) of the earlier movements. Watten <b>has</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> discontinuity between the New American poets, whose writing, he argues, privileged self-expression, and the Language poets, who see the poem as a construction in and of language itself. In contrast, Bernstein <b>has</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> expressive possibilities of working with constructed, and even found, language.|$|R

25|$|Despite {{being more}} {{famous for its}} Sauvignon blanc production, Chardonnay was New Zealand's most widely planted grape variety from 1990 till 2002 when Sauvignon blanc finally surpassed it. The east coast of the North Island, in places like Hawke's Bay and Wairarapa, have seen the most success with Chardonnay wine that has {{noticeable}} acidity and leanness. As better clonal varieties are discovered and planted, {{the overall quality of}} New Zealand Chardonnay have increased, particularly from places like Canterbury, Marlborough and Nelson. Some producers in the Gisborne region have recently developed a cult following for their Chardonnay among New Zealand wine drinkers. While many New Zealand winemakers are still developing a characteristic style, the Chardonnay produced so far <b>have</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> grape's affinity for oak.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of {{the bombings}} <b>have</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> {{strategic}} {{significance of the}} targets. Hiroshima was used as headquarters of the Second General Army and Fifth Division, which commanded the defense of southern Japan with 40,000 combatants stationed in the city. The city was also a communication center, an assembly area for combatants, a storage point, and had major industrial factories and workshops as well, and its air defenses consisted of five batteries of 7-cm and 8-cm (2.8 and 3.1 inch) anti-aircraft guns. Nagasaki was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging industrial activity, including the production of ordnance, warships, military equipment, and other war material. The city's air defenses consisted of four batteries of 7cm (2.8in) anti-aircraft guns and two searchlight batteries. An estimated 110,000 {{people were killed in}} the atomic bombings, including 20,000 Japanese combatants and 20,000 Korean slave laborers in Hiroshima and 23,145–28,113 Japanese factory workers, 2,000 Korean slave laborers, and 150 Japanese combatants in Nagasaki.|$|E

500|$|The phrase [...] "Black Lives Matter" [...] {{can refer}} to a Twitter hashtag, a slogan, a social movement, or a loose {{confederation}} of groups advocating for racial justice.

500|$|Generally, {{subsequent}} {{historians have}} either followed Erdmann, with further expansions upon his thesis, or rejected it. Some historians, such as Speros Vryonis, <b>have</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> {{influence of the}} rise of Islam generally, and the impact of the recent Seljuq onslaught specifically. Steven Runciman argued that the crusade was motivated by a combination of theological justification for holy war and a [...] "general restlessness and taste for adventure", especially among the Normans and the [...] "younger sons" [...] of the French nobility who had no other opportunities.|$|E
500|$|Radical historians in the 1960s, {{steeped in}} the anti-bureaucratic ethos of the New Left, deplored the {{emergence}} of bureaucratic school systems.
