25|$|Higgins {{made the}} perfect {{start to the}} 2015/2016 season as he claimed the Australian Goldfields Open by beating Martin Gould 9–8 in the final. He soon won the 28th ranking title of his career after he {{defeated}} David Gilbert 10–5 in {{the final of the}} International Championship. This moved Higgins level with Steve Davis in the list of ranking events won, but still eight behind Stephen Hendry. Higgins opened up his quarter-final with Neil Robertson at the UK Championship with the 600th century break of his career, but trailed 4–1. A 69 and two 134 breaks saw him level the tie, before Robertson went on to win 6–5. Higgins almost made it through to the final of the China Open, but a 131 break by Ricky Walden in the last <b>frame</b> <b>saw</b> him lose 6–5 in the semi-finals. He saw off Ryan Day 10–3 and Walden 13–8 at the World Championship, but lost 13–11 to Alan McManus in the quarter-finals having been 11–9 ahead and said later that he had cracked under pressure.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the issue of operating <b>frame</b> <b>saws,</b> maintenance and usage of saw blades. In the introductory part, historic development and improvement of <b>frame</b> <b>saws</b> in the Czech Republic and abroadis gradually dismantled. The second part focuses on the theoretical analysis of the process of cutting <b>frame</b> <b>saws.</b> Next part deals with technical - technological characteristics of <b>frame</b> <b>saws.</b> The cutting mechanism and also the usage of the machineis described there. Next part is focused on categorization of cutting <b>frame</b> <b>saws</b> according to a frame diameter and from the kinematic point of view. The next section describes the methods of division by <b>frame</b> <b>saws,</b> as well as {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the machines. The following section focuses on the cutting tool of <b>frame</b> <b>saws,</b> its definition and characteristics. In this section, a saw blades, its distribution, shape and geometry are described. The final part deals with maintenance of saw blades, compensation and removal of local defects of internal stress, subsequent control of internal tensions, as well as distributing of the blades. Further more, this part deals with grinding wheels for sharpening of saw blades and mistakes that occurduring the sharpening of the saws...|$|R

50|$|On hacksaws, as {{with most}} <b>frame</b> <b>saws,</b> the blade can be mounted with the teeth facing toward or away from the handle, {{resulting}} in cutting action on either the push or pull stroke. In normal use, cutting vertically downwards with work held in a bench vice, hacksaw blades should be set to be facing forwards. Some <b>frame</b> <b>saws,</b> including Fret Saws and Piercing Saws, have their blades set to be facing the handle because {{they are used to}} cut by being pulled down against a horizontal surface.|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} has been undertaken into the <b>frame</b> <b>sawing</b> with diamond blades. The kinematic behaviour of the <b>frame</b> <b>sawing</b> process is discussed. Under different cutting conditions, cutting and indenting-cutting tests {{are carried out}} by single point cutting tools and single diamond segments. The {{results indicate that the}} depth of cut per diamond grit increases as the blades move forward. Only a few grits per segment can remove the material in the cutting process. When the direction of the stroke changes, the cutting forces do not decrease to zero because of the residual plastic deformation beneath the diamond grits. The plastic deformation and fracture chipping of material are the dominant removal processes, which {{can be explained by the}} fracture theory of brittle materia...|$|R
50|$|Historically, the timbers {{would have}} been hewn square using a felling axe and then surface-finished with a broadaxe.

5000|$|Some archaeologists {{believe that}} the {{watermill}} is evidenced by a raised relief on the sarcophagus of a certain Marcus Aurelius Ammianos, a local miller. On the pediment a waterwheel fed by a mill race is shown powering via a gear train two <b>frame</b> <b>saws</b> cutting rectangular blocks by the way of connecting rods and, through mechanical necessity, cranks (see diagram). The accompanying inscription is in Greek and attributes the mechanism to Ammianos' [...] "skills with wheels".|$|R
25|$|Evidence for {{the crank}} {{combined}} with a connecting rod appears in the Hierapolis sawmill in Asia Minor from the 3rd century and two stone sawmills at Gerasa, Roman Syria, and Ephesus, Asia Minor (both 6th century). On the pediment of the Hierapolis mill, a waterwheel fed by a mill race is shown powering via a gear train two <b>frame</b> <b>saws</b> which cut rectangular blocks by the way {{of some kind of}} connecting rods and, through mechanical necessity, cranks. The accompanying inscription is in Greek.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of a saw mill is even simpler than a flour or grinding mill, since no gearing is needed, and the rotary saw blade can be driven direct from the water wheel axle, as the example of Sutter's Mill in California shows. However, a different mechanism is shown by the sawmill at Hieropolis involving a <b>frame</b> <b>saw</b> operated through a crank and connecting rod.|$|E
50|$|The Vesel Mill (Veselov mlin) {{is located}} at Žerovnica no. 59 next to the karst spring feeding Žerovniščica Creek and Vesel Cave (Veselova jama). It is a single-story {{building}} with the year 1845 carved into the door casing and 1843 carved into a beam. The property includes a smithy with stamp mills, a Venice <b>frame</b> <b>saw,</b> a stall built partially from stone, a hayloft, and a double hayrack with stone columns dating from 1840.|$|E
5000|$|All sawmills use rip saws {{of various}} types {{including}} the circular saw and band saw. Historically sawmills used one or more reciprocating saws more specifically known as an [...] "up-and-down" [...] or [...] "upright saw" [...] which are of two basic types, the <b>frame</b> <b>saw</b> or a muley (mulay) saw {{which is similar to}} the hand powered pit saw. Some sawmills also use crosscut saws to cut boards and planks to length.|$|E
2500|$|The Peugeot {{family of}} Valentigney, Montbéliard, Franche-Comté, France, {{began in the}} {{manufacturing}} business in the 19th century. In 1842, they added production of coffee, pepper, and salt grinders. The company's entry into the vehicle market was by means of crinoline dresses, which used steel rods, leading to umbrella <b>frames,</b> <b>saw</b> blades, chisels, wire wheels, and bicycles. Armand Peugeot introduced his [...] "Le Grand Bi" [...] penny-farthing in 1882, along {{with a range of}} other bicycles. The car company and bike company parted ways in 1926 but Peugeot bicycles continued to be built until very recently.|$|R
50|$|De Eenhoorn is a Dutch paltrok mill - {{a wooden}} mill {{supported}} {{on a short}} central post and a ring of wooden rollers on a low brick base and designed specifically for sawing wood. The mill body is boarded, however the sawing floor is open on three sides with only the windward facing side and the side roofs giving protection against the weather. The entire mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. On the front is a stage, 2.80 m above ground for setting the sails. The sails are common sails with a span of 20 m. They are carried on a cast iron windshaft of unknown manufacturer. The brake wheel with 75 cogs drives the crank wheel with 33 radial cogs on the horizontal crank shaft. There is no upright shaft. The crank shaft has four crank pins to drive four <b>sawing</b> <b>frames,</b> one more than common in Dutch wind-sawmills. The mill is also a bit wider than common to accommodate the extra <b>sawing</b> <b>frame.</b> The rearmost <b>sawing</b> <b>frame</b> was later removed and replaced by a reciprocating weight to keep the mechanism balanced. Connecting rods from the crank pins drive the <b>frame</b> <b>saws.</b> Reciprocating lever bars also drive the pawl and ratchet mechanisms which in turn drive the winches and the feeding mechanism of the log carriages through rack and pinion mechanisms. The winches {{can be used with}} the log hoist to lift logs from the water onto the sawing platform and to pull the log carriages back to their starting position.|$|R

The magician switches on the saw and apparently uses it to slice through the assistant's waist, which remains obscured by the <b>frame.</b> The <b>saw</b> emerges from {{the opposite side of}} the <b>frame.</b> Once the <b>sawing</b> is finished the frame is removed and the assistant is revealed to be in one piece.|$|R
50|$|The frame pit {{saw was the}} {{mainstay}} of resawing before stiff, unframed two-man saws called a muley or mulay saw, circular saws, and band saws took over. In some early sawmills a <b>frame</b> <b>saw</b> was powered from a water wheel, wind mill or other rotary motion through a crankshaft and connecting rod. Frame saws are now largely obsolete, though woodworkers who eschew power tools still make them for personal use in many sizes and styles of assembly.|$|E
50|$|The {{mill and}} sawmill at Setnik no. 5 {{is in the}} {{northern}} part of the settlement, along the road from Polhov Gradec. The buildings include a two-story house with the year 1857 carved into the stone door casing and a mill in the lower part, and a building for a sawmill. The mill has two stones and is turbine-driven; the stamp mill is in ruins. The abandoned sawmill has a fully preserved Francis turbine-driven Venice <b>frame</b> <b>saw.</b>|$|E
50|$|Narrower logs {{were also}} {{processed}} through the <b>frame</b> <b>saw.</b> Vertical saws {{contained within the}} frame cut a number of boards simultaneously, with the feed grips of the frame adjusting automatically to the taper of the log. A planing machine for further processing was originally located in the north-eastern corner of the mill, but was later removed. Once cut to the desired specification, the sawn timber was transported on trolleys aligned to rail lines into the holding yard at {{the eastern end of}} the mill to season.|$|E

A new tool is presented with a cutting thickness half that of the best achieved in conventional tools: a band saw with welded diamond segments. The first prototypes are built, cutting tests are carried out and the features of the cut are studied. In the second part, existing studies on measurement of cutting force in conventional tools are reviewed and the prototype band saw machine is monitored. Cutting forces in this new process are studied, with measurement of tangential force and feed force under various working conditions...|$|R
