5|$|By 6 April 1917, Voss {{had scored}} 24 {{victories}} and awarded Germany's highest award, the Pour le Mérite. The medal's mandatory month's leave removed Voss <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> during Bloody April; in his absence, Richthofen scored 13 victories. Nevertheless, Richthofen regarded Voss as his only possible rival as top scoring ace of the war.|$|E

5|$|Lee's plan, however, {{was based}} on faulty intelligence, {{exacerbated}} by Stuart's continued absence <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield.</b> Though Lee personally reconnoitered his left during the morning, he did not visit Longstreet's position on the Confederate right. Even so, Lee rejected suggestions that Longstreet move beyond Meade's left and attack the Union flank, capturing the supply trains and effectively blocking Meade's escape route.|$|E
5|$|The Emperor {{returned}} to Hungary {{in the early}} summer of 1044, and was joined in his advance by many Hungarian lords. The decisive battle was fought on 5 June at Ménfő (near Győr), where Samuel Aba's forces were defeated.

5|$|According to {{historical}} sources, Augvald and his cow were taken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> and buried at Avaldsnes. In his Saga of Olav Tryggvason, Oddr Snorrason writes that Tryggvason excavated two mounds on Karmøy, revealing {{the bones of}} a man in one and those of a cow in the other. Local legends contradict Augvald's burial at Avaldsnes, stating instead that he was buried in Ferkingstad, {{on the south side of}} the 12th-century churchyard. A large memorial stone, still standing, was raised outside the churchyard in memory of Augvald.|$|E

5|$|Cowan and Hook {{suggest that}} Lucullus would have {{deployed}} the Romans in a simplex acies, {{that is to}} say a single line, so making the frontage of the army as wide as possible as a counter to the cavalry. He took several of his troops downriver, where the river was the easiest to ford, and at one moment, Tigranes believed that this move meant Lucullus was withdrawing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dodge {{noted the}} number of Sauk dead at 40, {{possibly}} more; he reported that Ho-Chunk scouts and militia men took at least that number of scalps after the battle. U.S. allied Ho-Chunk, during the night following the battle, scalped another 11 Sauk {{who had been killed}} by the militia, and Dodge had seen Sauk wounded being carried <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> during the fighting. Dodge's forces suffered one dead and 8 wounded, of whom one was injured during the march to Wisconsin Heights, before the battle.|$|E
5|$|From 06:00 Wellington was in {{the field}} supervising the {{deployment}} of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under Bülow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it {{was in the}} best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield,</b> and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and Bülow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along Bülow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. Bülow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.|$|E

5|$|He {{planned to}} engage his two central armies with the Muslim centre {{in an effort}} to stall them while the main thrusts would be against the wings of the Muslim army, which would then either be driven away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> or pushed towards the centre. To observe the battlefield, Vahan had a large {{pavilion}} built behind his right wing with an Armenian bodyguard force. He ordered the army to prepare for the surprise attack.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{when the}} player confronts an enemy officer, the officer will {{challenge}} {{them to a}} one-on-one duel. If the player accepts, they will be transported to a small arena away from the main battlefield where a one-on-one fight with the officer will take place until either is victorious or time runs out. If the player declines, your morale will drop. If the player wins, their morale will rise and the enemy officer will be removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield.</b> If you accept the officers challenge they do become more difficult to beat in the duel.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Army's command {{structure}} fell apart as Bagration was evacuated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> and {{the report of}} him being hit quickly spread and caused morale collapse. Napoleon, who had been sick with a cold and was {{too far from the}} action to really observe what was going on, refused to send his subordinates reinforcements. He was hesitant to release his last reserve, the Imperial Guard, so far from France.|$|E

5|$|The Hungarian lords dethroned Peter in 1041 {{and elected}} Samuel king. According to the {{unanimous}} narration of the Hungarian chronicles, Samuel preferred commoners to noblemen, causing discontent among his former partisans. His execution of many opponents {{brought him into}} conflict with Bishop Gerard of Csanád. In 1044, Peter the Venetian returned {{with the assistance of}} the German monarch, Henry III, who defeated Samuel's larger army at the battle of Ménfő near Győr. Samuel fled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> but was captured and killed.|$|E
5|$|The way the {{conflict}} is described, by counting only two casualties, may point {{that there was a}} duel between the nobles of the two sides. However, {{it is also possible that}} the dead among the common soldiers were not considered important to mention. Although the outcome of the battle remained unresolved, Attarsiya decided to withdraw his troops <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield.</b> After his retreat from the Anatolian mainland, Madduwatta was again installed as a Hittite vassal in the region.|$|E
5|$|Although the French and the Austrians claimed {{victory at}} the time, {{military}} historians generally agree that the Austrians achieved a strategic advantage. However, the French withdrew <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> in good order and several days later crossed the Rhine River at Hüningen. A confusion of politics and diplomacy in Vienna wasted any strategic advantage that Charles might have obtained and locked the Habsburg force into two sieges on the Rhine, when the troops were badly needed in northern Italy. The battle is commemorated on a monument in Vienna and on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.|$|E
50|$|At {{the point}} of the Armistice there were some 141 graves in <b>the</b> cemetery. Concentration <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefields</b> and three smaller cemeteries (Boesinghe Chateau Grounds, Brissein House and Captain's Farm) {{enlarged}} this to the present 1,307.|$|R

Governor Bowie {{requested that}} Thomas Boullt of Hagerstown, Maryland, one of the Trustees for Maryland in the Antietam Cemetery, employ men to find and identify the Confederate dead buried in Washington and Frederick counties. Moses Poffinberger and Aaron Good of Sharpsburg identified ad hoc burial sites <b>from</b> throughout <b>the</b> western part of <b>the</b> state, primarily <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefields</b> at Antietam, Monocacy and South Mountain, but also from skirmishes and from Robert E.

While many serve as major characters in the story, others appear in cameo roles, such as the One Hundred and One Dalmatians playing a part in a side-quest. Most worlds also feature a Disney villain whom the player must defeat. The player can summon various Disney characters to fight alongside Sora in battle, causing Donald and Goofy to withdraw <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> {{for the duration of}} the summon. Available summoned characters include the Genie from Aladdin, Tinker Bell from Peter Pan, and Simba from The Lion King, among others.|$|E
5|$|At 6 p.m. the {{regiment}} {{was ordered to}} withdraw. It had lost almost all of its tanks and taken 42 casualties killed or wounded. In reserve, {{the regiment}} was issued with new tanks, a hasty mix of Shermans, Grants, and Crusaders (types II and III), mostly salvaged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> and rapidly repaired. Montgomery had been impressed {{with the performance of}} the 2nd New Zealand Division and wanted them to spearhead the next thrust, but Freyberg was unwilling to do so without reinforcements, as his troops had suffered so many casualties. Montgomery therefore placed 151 (from 50th Division) and 152 Infantry (from 51st Division) brigades under Freyberg's command for the next phase of the battle.|$|E
5|$|At 9:00am on March 10, North Vietnamese {{soldiers}} of the 368th Artillery Regiment dragged 12 pieces of artillery which included 85mm, 105mm and 122mm guns onto the top of Nui Vu and Han Thon, and aimed their guns directly on Hill-211 and the administrative centre of Tien Phuoc, to support the 31st Regiment attacking those areas. At 1:30pm, following two failed counter-attacks, South Vietnamese units in Phuoc Lam deserted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield.</b> In the mean time, however, South Vietnamese troops in Tien Phuoc could bare held their ground with support from two A-37 bombers, after South Vietnamese commanders on the ground had called for reinforcement from Chu Lai.
