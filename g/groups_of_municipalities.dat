5000|$|Local {{municipalities}} can {{be governed}} by statutes, enacted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly, specific to the type and class of municipality; by a home rule municipality, under a home rule charter, adopted by the municipality; or by an optional form of government, adopted by the municipality. The township is the basic population center or town element in Pennsylvania, {{ranging in size from}} small hamlets to small towns. These are given class I or Class II powers, attributes, and responsibilities, and generally constitute the majority of communities in Pennsylvania [...] - those characterized by low population densities occurring over a widespread geographic region within which a few small clusters of housing and mixed main road businesses occur. Excepting the larger territorial area, these townships would be considered hamlets and villages in Europe. Larger, more densely populated municipal entities, usually ones with a well defined business district and recognizable as having the traditional attributes of a 'town' is the Pennsylvania borough. There is a single (for historic reasons) town in Pennsylvania, so the next step up is the city. Both counties and School Districts general span multiples of communities, including <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>municipalities</b> that sometimes cross county lines. Each other subdivision is subordinate to county governmental functions, which include administration of courts, jails, code enforcement, and land registration.|$|E

The purpose of the paper is, therefore, to look for an answer to the question whether and to what extent the obtained funds correspond to the actual workload that municipalities have for performing statutory tasks and for exercising their competences. Analysis shows that, on an aggregate level, these actual systems ensure enough resources for local governments to cover their actual costs and current expendituressome <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>municipalities,</b> e. g. larger urban municipalities, municipalities with large proportions of elderly people etc. are faced with lack of funding, according to the actual costs data available, while other <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>municipalities</b> receive more funds than they need...|$|E

40|$|Until 1999 the endemic {{cases of}} Sylvatic Yellow Fever {{were located in}} the states of northern, midwestern and pre-Amazon regions.

Facts like these, added to the increase in incidences of serious adverse effects resulting from the Yellow Fever vaccination, have highlighted the importance of defining priority municipalities for vaccination against the disease in the state. Two <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>municipalities,</b> some affected and some non-affected by YF, were compared for environmental variables related to the eco-epidemiology of the disease according to literature.
