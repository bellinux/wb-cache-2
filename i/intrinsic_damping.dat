40|$|Precise {{control of}} tensile stress and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>damping</b> {{is crucial for}} the optimal design of nanomechanical systems for sensor {{applications}} and quantum optomechanics in particular. In this letter we study the in uence of oxygen plasma on the tensile stress and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>damping</b> of nanomechanical silicon nitride resonators. Oxygen plasma treatments are common steps in micro and nanofabrication. We show that oxygen plasma {{of only a few}} minutes oxidizes the silicon nitride surface, creating several nanometer thick silicon dioxide layers with a compressive stress of 1. 30 (16) GPa. Such oxide layers can cause a reduction of the e ective tensile stress of a 50 nm thick stoichiometric silicon nitride membrane by almost 50 %. Additionally, <b>intrinsic</b> <b>damping</b> linearly increases with the silicon dioxide lm thickness. An oxide layer of 1. 5 nm grown in just 10 s in a 50 W oxygen plasma almost doubled the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>damping.</b> The oxide surface layer can be e ciently removed in bu ered HF...|$|E

Therefore, {{it is possible to}} measure directly the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>damping</b> from forced oscillations, without additional calculations and with minor effort. At the same time the damping behaviour measured by different modes with a torsion pendulum, i. e. forced oscillations, sustained oscillations and free decay, in presence of amplitude dependent damping was also studied and similar results are obtained. ...|$|E
40|$|Magnetization {{dynamics}} {{are strongly}} influenced by damping. An effective damping constant αeff is often determined experimentally from the spectral linewidth of the free induction decay of the magnetization after the system is excited to its non-equilibrium state. Such an αeff, however, reflects both <b>intrinsic</b> <b>damping</b> as well as inhomogeneous broadening. In this paper we compare measurements of the magnetization dynamics in ultrathin non-epitaxial films having perpendicular magnetic anisotropy using two different techniques, time-resolved magneto optical Kerr effect (TRMOKE) and hybrid optical-electrical ferromagnetic resonance (OFMR). By using an external magnetic field that is applied at very small angles to the film plane in the TRMOKE studies, we develop an explicit closed-form analytical expression for the TRMOKE spectral linewidth and show how this {{can be used to}} reliably extract the intrinsic Gilbert damping constant. The damping constant determined in this way is in excellent agreement with that determined from the OFMR method on the same samples. Our studies indicate that the asymptotic high-field approach that is often used in the TRMOKE method to distinguish the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>damping</b> from the effective damping may result in significant error, because such high external magnetic fields are required to make this approach valid that they are out of reach. The error becomes larger the lower is the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>damping</b> constant, and thus may account for the anomalously high damping constants that are often reported in TRMOKE studies. In conventional ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) studies, inhomogeneous contributions can be readily distinguished from <b>intrinsic</b> <b>damping</b> contributions from the magnetic field dependence of the FMR linewidth. Using the analogous approach, we show how reliable values of the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>damping</b> can be extracted from TRMOKE. Comment: 34 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{explore the}} {{characteristics}} of blood glucose excursions of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with three different Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndromes. MethodsOne hundred and nine patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were recruited from the Department of Endocrinology and the Department of TCM of the Sixth People's Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Subjects were divided into three groups according to TCM syndrome: <b>intrinsic</b> <b>Damp</b> (n = 42), Yin deficiency and internal Heat (n = 25), and Qi and Yin deficiency (n = 42). Subcutaneous interstitial glucose was monitored with a continuous glucose monitoring system for 3 consecutive days to investigate the glycemic profile in each group. Plasma C-peptide levels were measured, and an arginine test was taken in 10 patients randomly selected from each group. Glucose data and glycemic variability were analyzed to investigate the differences among the groups. The change in C-peptide levels and the results from arginine trial were used to evaluate β cell function. ResultsIndicators reflecting blood glucose level were the highest in subjects with Yin deficiency and internal Heat syndrome, and parameters reflecting glycemic variability were the lowest in those with Qi and Yin deficiency syndrome. The change in C-peptide levels showed that subjects with Qi and Yin deficiency syndrome had the best β cell function among the three groups; this was confirmed by the arginine trial. ConclusionPatients with Qi and Yin deficiency syndrome had a more stable blood glucose profile, as glycemic variability was higher in those with <b>intrinsic</b> <b>Damp</b> syndrome and those with Yin deficiency and internal Heat syndrome...|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} that under {{appropriate}} conditions spin-transfer-driven magnetization dynamics in a single-domain nanomagnet is conservative {{in nature and}} admits a specific integral of motion, which is reduced to the usual magnetic energy when the spin current goes to zero. The existence of this conservation law {{is connected to the}} symmetry properties of the dynamics under simultaneous inversion of magnetisation and time. When one applies an external magnetic field parallel to the spin polarization, the dynamics is transformed from conservative into dissipative. More precisely, it is demonstrated that there exists a state function such that the field induces a monotone relaxation of this function toward its minima or maxima, depending on the field orientation. These results hold in the absence of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>damping</b> effects. When <b>intrinsic</b> <b>damping</b> is included in the description, a competition arises between field-induced and damping-induced relaxations, which leads to the appearance of limit cycles, that is, of magnetization self-oscillations.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. This thesis is concerned with the measurement of non-linear (i. e. strain amplitude dependent) <b>intrinsic</b> material <b>damping</b> in continuous fiber reinforced metalmatrix composites. The particular MMC studied is a 4 -ply, [O?]S, (O = 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 degree), P 55 Gr/Al- 6061 composite. A popular method for measuring damping is the free-decay of flexural vibrations of a cantilevered beam. The strain field in a cantilevered beam is inhomogeneous. For materials whose damping is non-linear, the measured damping is not equal to the <b>intrinsic</b> material <b>damping.</b> Using an elementary algorithm developed by Lazan, we extract non-linear <b>intrinsic</b> material <b>damping</b> from non-linear specimen damping. In general, damping is a function of temperature, strain amplitude and strain rate.

We suggest that the phenomenon results from interaction of cortical lateral inhibition with resonant periodic stimuli.

We show that the action of the SET on the resonator is very similar to that of a thermal bath, as it leads to a steady-state probability-distribution for the resonator which can be described by mean values of the resonator position, a renormalized frequency, an effective temperature and an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>damping</b> constant.

The combination of balance perturbations experiments and closed loop identification schemes {{made it possible to}} identify the reflex loop gains and intrinsic mechanical properties in various environmental conditions.

From the platform perturbation data the frequency response functions of the controller dynamics and the admittance of the balance control system were estimated with a non-parametric closed loop identification technique. Using a parametric model of balance control and a fitting procedure the sum of the intrinsic stiffness and neural position feedback gain, the neural time delay, the neural velocity feedback gain and the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>damping</b> were uniquely identified.

It is shown that careful alignment at a "magic-angle" between free and reference layer static equilibrium magnetization can allow direct measurement of the broadband intrinsic thermal spectra in the virtual absence of spin-torque effects which otherwise grossly distort the spectral line shapes and require linewidth extrapolations to zero current (which are nonetheless also shown to agree well with the direct method). The experimental magic-angle spectra are shown {{to be in good}} qualitative and quantitative agreement with both macrospin calculations and micromagnetic eigenmode analysis.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a quantitatively accurate first-principles description for {{the frequency and}} the linewidth of collective electronic excitations in inhomogeneous weakly disordered systems. A finite linewidth in general has intrinsic and extrinsic sources. At low temperatures and outside the region where electron-phonon interaction occurs, the only <b>intrinsic</b> <b>damping</b> mechanism is provided by electron-electron interaction. This kind of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>damping</b> can be described within time-dependent density-functional theory (TDFT), but one needs {{to go beyond the}} adiabatic approximation and include retardation effects. It was shown previously that a density-functional response theory that is local in space but nonlocal in time has to be constructed in terms of the currents, rather than the density. This theory will be reviewed {{in the first part of}} this paper. For quantitatively accurate linewidths, extrinsic dissipation mechanisms, such as impurities or disorder, have to be included. In the second part of this paper, we discuss how extrinsic dissipation can be described within the memory function formalism. We first review this formalism for homogeneous systems, and then present a synthesis of TDFT with the memory function formalism for inhomogeneous systems, to account simultaneously for intrinsic and extrinsic damping of collective excitations.

Under explicit consideration of asymptomatic and symptomatic infective individuals for the basic model without intervention the analysis shows that the dynamics of the epidemic is determined by a basic reproduction number R 0. A disease-free and an endemic equilibrium exist and are locally asymptotically stable when R 0 1 respectively. In the case of influenza, for acquired immunity lasting up to several years, the model’s <b>intrinsic</b> <b>damped</b> oscillations can resonate with an annually forced seasonal stimulus. When treatment is included the system has a basic reproduction number, which is the largest of the two reproduction numbers that characterise the drug-sensitive (R 1) or resistant (R 2) strains of the infectious agent. The system has a disease-free equilibrium, which is stable when both R 1 and R 2 are less than unity. Two endemic equilibria also exist and are associated with treatment and the development of drug resistance. An endemic equilibrium exists when R 2 > 1 and where only the drug resistant strain is present.
