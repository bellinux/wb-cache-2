40|$|With {{increased}} {{oil and gas}} {{activity in}} low-temperature areas of the world, it is highly important that the industry utilize the most robust materials and zero-leakage solutions. The O ring {{is a type of}} elastomer sealer that, among other applications, is used in pipe connections. Such seals must withstand high pressures and sudden pressure drops, as well as different contact media and a wide temperature range. The capability of the O ring has been investigated. Standard failure modes have been studied and the different features necessary to protect against leaks, such as oil and fuel resistance, resistance towards more aggressive fluids, operating temperature spectre and mechanical properties have been looked into. The mechanical properties of filler/elastomer composites have been tested at a range of temperatures from room temperature to - 25 °C, with respect to <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> and hysteresis (energy loss) development. O rings for use in the arctic must have a sufficiently low glass transition temperature (Tg) for the environment in which the seals will be used. They should be impervious to contact media and gas diffusion, and they must be able to operate at high system pressures without suffering from compression set, extrusion or abrasion. It has been found that <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> increase significantly at temperatures below the Tg. When adding filler to the elastomer, a higher <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> is obtained. This effect is bigger at low temperatures.

Recently allometric research focused on plants and in particular plant leaves due to their importance in nutrient flow and gas exchange. Allometric plant research aims to enhance our understanding of the ontogeny of plants and offers a tool for ecological modeling. Previous allometric models have glanced over the influence of biomechanics on leaf form and function. This research will test if density-dependent stiffness of petioles is variable or if it scales with leaf mass.

Two distinct tests are analyzed in this thesis, a cantilever bending test (CBT) and a three-point bending test (TPBT), both on Coscinodiscus sp. frustules. The simulations of the CBT and TPBT returned <b>young</b> <b>s</b> moduli of 32. 8 GPa and 36. 7 GPa, respectively.

However, the point of highest stress in the TPBT simulation does not coincide with the fracture in the specimen. Since the results presented in this thesis are based on only two models, the dataset is insufficient to draw any conclusions as to the mechanical properties of the material.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Metallic materials have gained much attention recently from the areas of medical devices and orthopaedics. Artificial organs, dental implants, prostheses and implants that replace damaged or malfunctioning parts in the body are, or contain, metal components. Our ageing society poses an increased demand to provide devices and implants that can demonstrate better performance than those presented by traditional solutions. Matching the mechanical properties (i. e. stiffness and strength) of the device {{to those of the}} host tissue is a major challenge for the design and manufacture of engineered metal materials for biomedical applications. Failure in doing so provokes implant loosening, patient discomfort and repeated surgeries. Therefore, tailoring physical properties and biocompatibility of those materials is the main final aim of this research programme. This PhD study has focused on the tailoring of the mechanical properties of titanium-based materials and titanium-based alloys. Titanium inertness and the selection of biocompatible alloying elements were set as the baseline. Two approaches were employed to decrease stiffness (i. e. <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus)</b> : one, by introducing porosity in a titanium matrix and therefore, reduce its <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus,</b> and two, by designing and manufacturing beta-titanium-based alloys with a reduced <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus.</b> Titanium scaffolds were manufactured using powder metallurgy with space holder technique and a sintering process. Different space holder sizes were used in four different categories to study the effect of pore size and porosity on the mechanical properties of the porosity engineered Ti scaffolds. Ti-based alloys were manufactured using manufacturing techniques such as sintering and arc-melting. The effect of different fabrication processes and the addition of beta-stabilising elements were studied and investigated. The obtained results of mechanical properties for pore size and porosity were within the values that match bone properties. This means these materials are suitable for biomedical application and the beta-Ti alloys results show that the mechanical properties can be decreased via tailoring the crystal structures. The characterisation of the Ti-based alloys helps to develop this material for its use in biomedical application...|$|R

The mechanical properties of the diatom frustule have been a popular area of research in recent years. The biosilica seems to be outperforming human pro- duced fused silica in terms of strength. The morphology and mechanical prop- erties of the diatom Coscinodiscus sp., examined by atomic force microscopy, is reported in this thesis. The frustule is made up by three layers, where it have been found a decrease in pore size from the inner to the outer layer. The mean pore diameter {{was determined to be}} 832 ± 133 nm, 447 ± 73 nm and 72 ± 12 nm for the inner(foramen), mid(cribrum) and outer(cribellum) layer, respectively.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, we report results from {{molecular}} dynamics (MD) simulations of uniaxial tension and compression tests on hexagonal prism [111] -SiC nanowires. The simulation {{results show that}} after relaxation for 300, 000 time-steps without any constraints, the nanowires were observed to elongate along the length direction without visible bending or buckling. At the two ends of nanowires, deformation was more severe and nonuniform, showing the end effect. We excluded a few lattices {{at each of the}} two ends and studied the deformation without the end effect. At the atomic level, the initial deformation induced by free surfaces was inhomogeneous, which changed from the surface atomic layer to the interior atomic layer. The layer-averaged potential energy per carbon (or silicon) atom had the highest value at the surface and dropped gradually from the surface to the interior. Clearly, the energy distribution was inhomogenous at the atomic level in the nanowire. Following Gibbs approach to surface excess energy, we analyzed surface energy, surface stress, and surface elastic constants of a nanowire by treating a nanowire as a composite of a hypothetical bulk phase, a true two-dimensional geometric surface phase, and a true one-dimensional geometric edge phase. Furthermore, the hypothetical nanowire, two-dimensional surfaces and one-dimensional edges were all assumed to be thermodynamically homogeneous, which was necessary {{for the study of the}} continuum concepts of surface energy, surface stress, surface elastic constants and the <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> of nanowires. The stress-free status of the bulk body was taken as the reference state. Then, we found that the initial strain of SiC nanowires without any applied loads was at the magnitude of 1 % and changed with the nanowire cross-sectional perimeter, exhibiting that the smaller the cross-sectional perimeter, the larger the initial strain. The uniaxial tension and compression tests were simulated on the initially equilibrated nanowires. This means the initial equilibrium state is the reference state to calculate the work done by an applied load and then changes in the surface energy and in the internal energy of the nanowire. For a finite piece of nanomaterial without any applied loads, its surface induced an initial deformation on it and generated an internal stress field in the hypothetical bulk, surface and edge phases. At equilibrium, the total force among the three phases self-balanced. With this theoretical approach, we successfully analyzed the MD simulation results of the size-dependent specific surface energy and <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus...</b>|$|R

We propose a simple and concise method for deforming meshes defined with three-node triangular or four-node tetrahedral elements. The mesh deformation method is suitable for large boundary movement. The approach requires two consecutive linear elastic finite-element analyses of an isotropic continuum using a prescribed displacement at the mesh boundaries. The first analysis is performed with homogeneous elastic property and the second with inhomogeneous elastic property. The fully stressed design is employed with a vanishing Poisson s ratio and a proposed form of equivalent strain (modified Tresca equivalent strain) to calculate, from the strain result of the first analysis, the element-specific <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> for the second analysis.

Export of electricity to India is now the largest contributor to the economic well being {{of the country and}} an ambitious plan of harnessing over 10000 MW of hydropower by the year 2020 is being carried out. The large scale hydropower development in Bhutan started in the 1980 s with construction of the Chhukha hydroelectric plant with capacity of 336 MW. The next milestone was the commission of the 1020 MW Tala hydroelectric plant in 2006 and 2007. The two plants are in close proximity to one another, near the Main Central Thrust of the Himalayan fault system. Here the powerhouse excavations of both power plants will be modelled and analysed, regarding stability and accuracy of rock mass quality parameters, with focus on Tala hydroelectric plant. The powerhouse complex at Tala, which consists of two large caverns, has experienced failure both during construction and while operating. During the excavation of the crown portion of the powerhouse large rockfall occurred in the roof and {{during the rest of the}} excavation and after commission rockbolts have been failing. No records are of failure in the Chhukha powerhouse cavern after construction, but during excavation fatal rockfall occurred. The Main Central Thrust provides high horizontal stresses, especially at Tala, in overall poor rock conditions. The initial modelling is done in Examine 3 D, a 3 D BEM elastic modelling software. The model of Tala powerhouse complex is then compared to models from Examine 2 D and Phase 2, elastic 2 D BEM and plastic 2 D FEM models respectively. The powerhouse of Chhukha is also modelled in Examine 3 D, and circumstances compared to Tala. Additionally, the model of Tala is matched with actual measured values of convergence, but maximum convergence measured in the powerhouse cavern was 0, 374 m. That was done by iterating the <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> in the Phase 2 until a value that represented the actual convergence was found.

However, the biocompatibility of the capsules and their long-time stability under physiological conditions are two major problems related to cell encapsulation. Alginate is a linear binary copolymer consisting of β-D-mannuronic acid and α-L-guluronic acid linked by 1, 4 -glycosidic bonds, and is known to form gels with divalent ions like calcium. To increase the stability of alginate gel beads in physiological solutions, a polycation layer has traditionally been used to coat the alginate gel beads.

Recently, alginates isolated from Laminaria hyperborea leaf with intermediate guluronic acid content was found to be highly biocompatible. However, gels prepared from alginates with intermediate guluronic acid content are known to exhibit lower mechanical strength and stability compared to alginate gels rich in guluronic acid. In the present work, the stability and mechanical strength of L. hyp. leaf alginate gels were investigated to potentially provide a strategy to increase the stability of leaf alginate gel beads. The possibilities of generating leaf alginate gel beads crosslinked with calcium and chitosan oligomers were investigated, and the stability in terms of size and polymer leakage of the alginate-CO gel beads was studied. The mechanical properties in terms of <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> and rupture strength were investigated for L. hyp. leaf alginate gel cylinders of varying molecular weights and concentrations, where gel cylinders prepared from low molecular weight L. hyp. stipe alginate were included as a reference.

Furthermore, the stability of low molecular weight L. hyp. leaf alginate gel beads in saline, in terms of swelling and polymer leakage, was investigated. High molecular weight L. hyp. leaf was included in the study for comparison. The chemical compositions of the leaked alginate from alginate-CO gel beads and low molecular weight leaf alginate gel beads were determined by 1 H-NMR. For the low molecular weight leaf alginate gel beads, average molecular weights of the leaked alginates were obtained with SEC-MALLS. Introducing chitosan oligomers into the crosslinking of alginate gel beads with calcium had a minor stabilizing effect with respect to size at pH 5. 0, whereas alginate-CO gel beads prepared at pH 6. 5 showed no stabilizing effect, compared to alginate gel beads gelled only with calcium. At pH 5. 0, both alginate and chitosan oligomers are fully charged, hence expected to form strong interactions. The leaked alginate from the alginate-CO gel beads had a similar chemical composition to the starting material of alginate. Increasing the alginate concentration for the high and low molecular weight leaf alginate gel cylinders led to higher gel strength in terms of <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> and rupture strength. The <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> of the alginate gels were independent of the molecular weight in the given range (Mw = 115 - 200 kDa), while rupture strength increased with increasing molecular weight in the same range. Syneresis of the alginate gels decreased with increasing alginate concentration and decreasing molecular weight. The size stability of low molecular weight L. hyp. leaf alginate gel beads increased with increasing alginate concentration. No significant difference was seen between the 1. 8 % (w/v) low and high molecular weight leaf alginate gel beads with regards to size stability. The degree of polymer leakage decreased with increasing alginate concentration and increasing molecular weight. The leaked materials from the low molecular weight leaf alginate gel beads were enriched in mannuronic acid compared to the starting material of alginate. Increasing the alginate concentration of the L. hyp. leaf alginate gel beads showed promising results with regards to increasing stability of the gel beads. The molecular weight of the alginate had only minor effects on the stability. Introducing chitosan oligomers into the crosslinking of alginate with calcium had a slightly stabilizing effect at pH 5. 0. However, pH 5. 0 might compromise the viability of the cells being encapsulated...|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} PLD technique combining {{laser ablation}} and laser induced thermal evaporation {{was introduced to}} deposit thin films onto the inner surfaces of components. Beside the well known film properties of the classical PLD, like high reproducibility, smooth surface and high thickness precision, this novel combination of laser ablation and evaporation is characterized by improved or extended properties in terms of microstructure, deposition rate and possible layer thickness. The extension of the conventional PLD process allows for the co-deposition of dense, amorphous films as well as columnar grown or even porous films with thick nesses up to several tens of micrometers. In a first successful application of the novel process, tailored thermal barrier coatings (TBC s) for combustion chambers were realized. A remarkable result was that these coatings sustained very large strains of about 5 % without notable delaminations. Under hot gas testing in model combustion chambers, the PLD-TBC s showed very promising behavior with excellent adhesion. Super hard, amorphous carbon films (DLC) deposited onto the inner surfaces of small components by this PLD technique are characterized by a <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> of about 400500 GPa and a low friction coefficient of about 0. 1. Due to its layered structure, with graded material density and hardness, this DLC exhibits relatively low internal compressive stresses of about - 1 [...] . - 2 GPa...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the use of}} {{polyimide}} foam as {{a lining}} in double panel applications is considered. It is being investigated here {{as a replacement for}} aircraft grade glass fiber and has a number of attractive functional attributes, {{not the least of which}} is its high fire resistance. The test configuration studied here consisted of two 1 mm (0. 04 in.) thick, flat aluminum panels separated by 12. 7 cm (5. 0 in.) with a 7. 6 cm (3. 0 in.) thick layer of foam centered in that space. Random incidence transmission loss measurements were conducted on this buildup, and conventional poro-elastic models were used to predict the performance of the lining material. Results from two densities of foam are considered. The Biot parameters of the foam were determined by a combination of direct measurement (for density, flow resistivity and <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus)</b> and inverse characterization procedures (for porosity, tortuosity, viscous and thermal characteristic length, Poisson s ratio and loss factor). The inverse characterization procedure involved matching normal incidence standing wave tube measurements of absorption coefficient and transmission loss of the isolated foam with finite element predictions. When the foam parameters determined in this way were used to predict the performance of the complete double panel system, reasonable agreement was obtained between the measured transmission loss and predictions made using a commercial statistical energy analysis code...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to develop and {{evaluate}} the in vitro performance of a new and simplified formulation of photocuring resin to be used as dental sealant. Two experimental dental sealants (CYTED 1 and CYTED 2) were formulated and their kinetic of polymerisation and physico-chemical properties were studied and compared to those of two commercially available sealants (Helioseal, Delton-FS). Rates of photoinitiated polymerisation (Rp), as well as the conversions and the quantum yields of polymerisation (p) were calculated. Flexural strength, <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus,</b> microhardness, microleakage, water sorption, and solubility were also tested. ANOVA, Student-Newman-Keuls, Pearson correlation and Kruskal–Wallis tests were used (p < 0. 05). The highest Rp and p were obtained for the sealant CYTED 2, Rp and p were similar for CYTEDl and Helioseal, and the lowest for Delton. Water sorption values were similar for Helioseal and CYTED 2 being higher for CYTED 1 and lower for Delton. No differences were found for solubility and microleakage values. Mechanical properties were better for Delton and no differences were found within the rest of the sealants.

40|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) {{functions as a}} structural scaffold for cells and controls cellular function through cell-matrix interactions. These interactions are required by most cells {{in order to maintain}} viable and promote proliferation. Therefore, an appropriate synthetic {{extracellular matrix}} is necessary for tissue engineering applications. Hydrogels, either derived from synthetic or natural polymers, are an alternative. Alginate is a linear co-polymer formed by (1 → 4) -linked α-D-mannuronate (M) and its C- 5 epimer β-L-guluronate (G). This natural polymer can be grafted with short bioactive peptide sequences by resorting to periodate oxidation and reductive amination, which can promote cell attachment. This work studied the effects of saline treatment on the mechanical properties and stability of calcium gels of stipe alginate and oxidised alginate. The results showed that Ca-alginate gels of chemically modified alginate are more prone to degradation than stipe alginate when subjected to saline treatments. This was viewed as a decreasing <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> and storage modulus of the gels as a function of saline treatments. Additionally, the leaked material from the gels presented an initially low G-content and average G-block length, which then increased, indicating that the mixed-in partially oxidised alginate leaked out first. In sum, the use of periodate oxidation allowed to tailor the degradation rate of calcium alginate gels by varying the content of chemically modified alginate...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that thin face sheets of wide-aperture deformable mirrors in adaptive-optics systems be made from a composite material consisting of cyanate ester filled with graphite. This composite material appears to offer an attractive alternative to low-thermal-expansion glasses {{that are used in}} some conventional optics and have been considered for adaptive-optics face sheets. Adaptive-optics face sheets are required to have maximum linear dimensions of the order of meters or even tens of meters for some astronomical applications. If the face sheets were to be made from low-thermal-expansion glasses, then they would also be required to have thicknesses of the order of a millimeter so as to obtain the optimum compromise between the stiffness needed for support and the flexibility needed to enable deformation to controlled shapes by use of actuators. It is difficult to make large glass sheets having thicknesses less than 3 mm, and 3 -mm-thick glass sheets are too stiff to be deformable to the shapes typically required for correction of wavefronts of light that has traversed the terrestrial atmosphere. Moreover, the primary commercially produced candidate low-thermal-expansion glass is easily fractured when in the form of thin face sheets. Graphite-filled cyanate ester has relevant properties {{similar to those of the}} low-expansion glasses. These properties include a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the order of a hundredth of the CTEs of other typical mirror materials. The <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> (which quantifies stiffness in tension and compression) of graphite-filled cyanate ester is also similar to the Young's moduli of low-thermal-expansion glasses. However, the fracture toughness of graphite-filled cyanate ester is much greater than that of the primary candidate low-thermal-expansion glass. Therefore, graphite-filled cyanate ester could be made into nearly unbreakable face sheets, having maximum linear dimensions greater than a meter and thicknesses of the order of a millimeter, that would satisfy the requirements for use in adaptive optics...|$|R
40|$|The work {{described}} in this paper {{was focused on the}} use of a new polyimide foam in a double wall sound transmission loss application. Recall that polyimide foams are functionally attractive, compared to polyurethane foams, for example, owing to their fire resistance. The foam considered here was found to have a flow resistivity that was too high for conventional acoustical applications, and as a result, it was processed by partial crushing to lower the flow resistivity into an acceptable range. Procedures for measuring the flow resistivity and <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> of the material have been described, as was an inverse characterization procedure for estimating the remaining Biot parameters based on standing wave tube measurements of transmission loss and absorption coefficient. The inverse characterization was performed using a finite element model implementation of the Biot poro-elastic material theory. Those parameters were then used to predict the sound transmission loss of a double panel system lined with polyimide foam, and the predictions were compared with full-scale transmission loss measurements. The agreement between the two was reasonable, especially in the high and low frequency limits; however, {{it was found that the}} SEA model resulted in an under-prediction of the transmission loss in the mid-frequency range. Nonetheless, it was concluded that the performance of polyimide foam could be predicted using conventional poro-elastic material models and that polyimide foam may offer an attractive alternative to other double wall linings in certain situations: e. g., when fire resistance is a key issue. Future work will concentrate on reducing the density of the foam to values similar to those used in current aircraft sidewall treatments, and developing procedures to improve the performance of the foam in transmission loss applications...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the latter}} half of twentieth century, {{developments}} in nano science and nanotechnology have been motivated by discoveries of a variety of carbon nanostructures and metal nanoparticles along with other special structures. Due to their unique thermal, electronic, magnetic and optical properties metal nanoparticles and carbon nanostructures catch copious applications in several fields either as individual units or as dispersed media into a matrix or host materials and polymer nanocomposites. Efforts are being made to search the most well suited material for a number of applications. Though nanoparticles and nanocomposites have answered many of the problems of the modern era, yet there is an unfulfilled pursuit in this field, resulting in the invention and development of newer material each day. The present study is yet another effort to add some useful material to the nanoscience and technology which may serve as a â€žproblem solver [...] Nanoparticles of silver and copper were synthesized successfully by the chemical reduction method. Three types of filler materials were used to synthesize nanocomposites; silver nanoparticles, copper nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes. Using these nanomaterials, various nanocomposites were prepared with poly (vinyl alcohol) as polymer matrix. Three types of filler materials were used in different combinations in order to obtain seven different types of composites systems. Each system was prepared with five different concentrations of the composites. Composites were synthesized in solution form and films were grown, of these newly developed nanocomposites. The detail characterization of the nanoparticles was carried out using AC Impedance Spectroscopy, Tensile testing (Tensile Strength, <b>Young.</b> <b>s</b> <b>Modulus,</b> Elongation at Break), X Ray Diffraction (XRD), Differential Thermal Analysis, Thermal Gravimetric Analysis / (TG/DTA), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Ionic conductivity of the nanocomposites was determined from impedance spectroscopy. All the types of prepared materials were found to conduct ionic conductivity in varying range. Nanocomposites of CNT exhibited lowest ionic conductivity while those with copper nanoparticles showed highest ionic conductivity. Overall range of ionic conductivity was found out to be of the order of 10 - 8 to 10 - 4 Scm- 1. Tensile properties were determined using Universal Testing Machine. Three important tensile properties were studied; tensile strength, <b>Young.</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> and elongation at break. These properties displayed an enhancing behavior with an increase in the higher concentrations of the filler in most of the composites. Elongation at break showed most pronounced change. XRD was used to figure out the structural changes in the prepared composites. It was revealed that most of the nanocomposites exhibited a gradual transformation from semi crystalline to amorphous nature with the addition of the filler. Thermal gravimetery was conducted in order to figure out thermal properties. The graphs of TG/DTA showed a regular pattern of decrease in mass with an increase in the temperature. From the thermal graphs of the composites it was discovered that thermal stability of synthesized materials was enhanced with an increase in the mass of the fillers in the nanocomposite. In order to investigate the morphology of the developed nanocomposites; and size of the synthesized nanoparticles Atomic Force Spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy were brought into business. It was revealed that the size of the nanoparticles was lesser than 50 nanometer. The diameter of carbon nanotubes was found to be of the same dimensions. Surface morphology and topography was found using SEM and AFM. It was discovered that the nanocomposites possessed a smooth surface morphology with a uniform dispersion of fillers in the polymer matrix; showing a good polymer-filler morphological arrangement at the interphase which is an indicative of a good compatibility of the polymer with the filler material. The interaction of the components of the composites causes an enhancement in the properties exhibited by the composites...|$|R
40|$|When {{monitoring}} tensile {{tests of}} thermoplastic polyurethanes TPU by small angle X ray scattering SAXS {{we find a}} filler to crosslink conversion of hard domain function. Its strength {{is related to the}} chemical composition and governs the mechanical performance of the TPUs. Acting as fillers, the domains provide a high modulus of elasticity. Once the domains take load, they lose their filler function and the material gains in extensibility. All the five machine cast TPUs have soft segments from PTHF 1000 and a hard segment content amp; 8776; 45. The hard segments are built from different diisocyanates DI and diols chain extenders, CE. The base material has hard segments made from 1, 4 butanediol BD and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate MDI. Two other TPUs contain as DIs either the hydrogenated, isomeric MDI H 12 MDI or hexamethylene diisocyanate HDI, respectively. In two other materials the CE is varied. Here the BD is replaced by either the shorter 1, 3 propanediol PD or by the longer 1, 6 hexanediol HD. A morphological model is fitted to the SAXS data. It returns nanoscopic parameters, e. g. discriminating between the total Vt and the crosslinked Vx volume of hard domains. Fillers are Vf Vt amp; 8722;Vx. Results show that Vf domains can be converted into Vx domains. Hydrogenation of the aromatic base DI does not change Vt, but Vx lags behind. <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> is higher filler function, high Vf, but the material breaks earlier low Vx. Generally, Vt increases for small strains strain induced domains, SIDs and decreases for strain gt; 1. SIDs start as fillers.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Nanoporous polymer fibres are currently attracting increasing interest due to their unique characteristics. Increased specific surface area, improved mechanical properties and improved cellular growth are amongst the advantages that set porous fibres as ideal candidates in applications like catalysis, separation and tissue engineering. This work explores the single step production of porous poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) fibres through combinative electrospinning and Non-solvent Induced Phase Separation (NIPS) technique. Theoretical models, based on three different contact models (Hertzian, DMT, JKR), correlating the fibrous network specific surface area to material properties (density, surface tension, <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus,</b> Poisson <b>s</b> ratio) and network physical properties (density) and geometrical characteristics (fibre radius, fibre aspect ratio, network thickness) were developed in order to calculate the surface area increase caused by pore induction. Experimental results proved that a specific surface area increase of up to 56 % could be achieved, compared to networks composed of smooth surfaced fibres. The good solvent effect on electrospun fibre surface morphology and size was examined through experimental investigation of four different good solvent (chloroform, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran and formic acid) based solutions at various good/poor solvent ratios. Chloroform was proven {{to be the most}} suitable solvent for good /poor solvent ratios varying from 75 - 90 % v/v, whereas alternative mechanisms leading to different fibre morphologies were identified, interpreted and discussed. Evaporation rate of the good solvent was identified as the key parameter of the process. Second order polynomial equations, derived from the experimental data, correlating the feed solution physical parameters (viscosity, conductivity, surface tension) to the fibre average diameter produced were developed and validated. Response surface methodology was implemented for the design and conduction of electrospinning experiments on a 12. 5 % w/v Chloroform/DMSO solution 90 / 10 % v/v {{in order to determine the}} individual process parameters (spinning distance, applied voltage, solution flow rate) effect in fibre surface morphology and size. The increase in any of these parameters results in increase of both the fibre size and the tendency for pore generation, whereas applied voltage was the parameter with the strongest effect. Findings from this thesis expand the knowledge about both phenomena occurring during the production process and end product properties, and can be used for the production of controlled morphology and size porous poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) fibres...|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Thesis (Ph. D.) : Bilkent University, Department of Materials Science and Nanotechnology, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2017. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 88 - 111). In this thesis, changes in Young's modulus of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were investigated during their osteogenic differentiation on bioactive peptide nanofibers that bear triple glutamic acid sequence (EEE), a non-collagenous protein sequence of some extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (e. g. bone sialoprotein) found in bone tissue. MSCs formed spherical cell aggregates on the osteoinductive peptide nanofibers, here also called osteospheroids, of which their cells made intensive cell-cell contacts and showed osteoblast-like cell morphology. Mechanical {{characterization of the}} osteospheroids on the peptide nanofiber hydrogel was performed using atomic force microscope (AFM) where AFM probes modified with a thin film coating of octa uorocyclobutane (C 4 F 8) were used to measure force maps of the cells at days 3, 7 and 14 of osteogenic differentiation. Hertz Cone model, same as Sneddon, was applied to approach curves of 12 force curves per cell to calculate the <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> values. As a result, an increasing pattern was observed in the average Young's modulus of rMSCs on the peptide nanofibers throughout the osteogenic differentiation. Mineral deposition by the cells on the peptide nanofibers was checked by Alizarin red staining and {{a large amount of}} mineral deposition by the osteospheroids was observed, proving that an efficient osteogenic differentiation of the rMSCs happens on the osteoinductive peptide nanofibers. In the literature, a gradual decrease is shown in AFM measured average Young's modulus values of adhered MSCs throughout their osteogenic differentiation. When gelatin-coated glass was used as substrate instead of the peptide nanofibers, rMSCs showed a decreasing pattern in their Young's moduli, similarly to the literature, due to osteogenic differentiation. However, there was no significant calcium mineral deposition on the gelatin group, even until day 14 of osteogenic differentiation, indicating that a limited or a slower progression of osteogenic differentiation of rMSCs is present on the gelatin compared to rMSCs on the osteoinductive peptide nanofibers. A correlation between the observed increase in average Young's moduli of osteospheroid rMSCs and their mineral production on the peptide nanofibers may suggest a predominant role of biomineralization on the cell mechanics. by Ahmet Emin Topal.
