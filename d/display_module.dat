The maximum principal stresses at the upper glasses of modules were considered as responses, which were analyzed using a commercial software ABAQUS/Explicit.

5000|$|Felsenstein was {{influenced}} in his philosophy by {{the works of}} Ivan Illich, particularly Tools for Conviviality (Harper and Row, 1973). This book advocated a [...] "convivial" [...] approach to design which allowed users of technologies {{to learn about the}} technology by encouraging exploration, tinkering, and modification. Felsenstein had learned about electronics in much the same fashion, and summarized his conclusions in several aphorisms, to wit - [...] "In order to survive in a public-access environment, a computer must grow a computer club around itself." [...] Others were - [...] "To change the rules, change the tools," [...] and [...] "If work is to become play, then tools must become toys."Felsenstein was one of the original members of the Homebrew Computer Club, which formed in 1975 in response to the appearance of the Altair 8800 computer kit. With a handy yard stick, Felsenstein [...] "moderated" [...] meetings at the SLAC Auditorium. He was less a chair than a keeper of chaos. In this heyday of the development of the first personal computers, Felsenstein designed the Intel 8080 based [...] "SOL" [...] computer from Processor Technology, the Pennywhistle modem, and other early [...] "S-100 bus" [...] era designs.

50|$|An {{electronic}} shelf label (ESL) {{system is}} used by retailers for displaying product pricing on shelves. Typically, electronic <b>display</b> <b>modules</b> {{are attached to the}} front edge of retail shelving. These modules use electronic paper (E-paper) or liquid-crystal display (LCD) to show the current product price to the customer. E-paper is currently trending in the ESL market as it provides crisp display and supports full graphic imaging. A communication network allows the price display to be automatically updated whenever a product price is changed. This communication network is the true differentiation and what really makes ESL a viable solution. The wireless communication must support reasonable range, speed, battery life, and reliability. The means of wireless communication can be based on radio, infrared or even visible light communication. Currently, the ESL market leans heavily towards radio frequency based ESL solutions.|$|R
