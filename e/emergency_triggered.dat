40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{emergency}} repair model. We model {{a situation where}} failed parts arrive at a repair shop according to a Poisson process. If the stock on hand of serviceable spare parts exceeds a given <b>emergency</b> <b>trigger</b> level, the failed part is sent into normal repair. Otherwise the failed part is sent into an alternative emergency repair channel. Upon arrival failed parts are exchanged for serviceable spare parts, if available. Otherwise the demand is backordered. A backorder {{is filled with the}} first part that becomes available from either one of the repair processes. The repair times (including transportation time) are assumed to be exponentially distributed. We analyze the impact of using emergency repair on two service measures: the fraction of demand that is satisfied from stock on hand and the expected duration of a backorder. We calculate the initial stock level and the <b>emergency</b> <b>trigger</b> level that minimize the total cost for a given emergency repair rate. The proposed policy is compared with two other policies: (1) emergency repair is not used and (2) <b>emergency</b> <b>trigger</b> level is zero. We find that significant service improvements and cost reductions can be obtained by using our emergency repair policy. We also present simulation results showing that the distribution of the repair times has a negligible effect on the relevant service measures. Finally, we compare our results with the results of an emergency supply model by Muckstadt and Thomas [1] Again we observe significant cost reductions when using our policy...|$|R

40|$|A {{radiological}} emergency exists at the Fukushima Daiichi (Fukushima I) {{nuclear power plant}} in Japan {{as a result of}} the March 11, 2011 magnitude 9. 0 earthquake and the massive tsunami that arrived later. News media misinformation related to the <b>emergency</b> <b>triggered</b> enormous social fear worldwide of the radioactivity that is being released from damaged fuel rods. The heroic recovery workers are a major concern because they are being exposed to mostly gamma radiation during their work shifts and life-threatening damage to the radiosensitive bone marrow could occur over time. This paper presents a way in which the bone marrow equivalent dose (in millisieverts), as estimated per work shift, could be used along with the hazard function model previously developed for radiological risk assessment to repeatedly check for potential life-threatening harm (hematopoietic system damage) to workers. Three categories of radiation hazard indication are proposed: 1, life-threatening damage unlikely; 2, life-threatening damage possible; 3, life-threatening damage likely. Categories 2 and 3 would be avoided if the whole body effective dose did not exceed the annual effective dose limit of 250 mSv. For down-wind populations, hormetic effects (activated natural protective processes) are much more likely than are deleterious effects...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates {{workplace}} and organisational learning {{over the period}} 2000 - 2010 in a Belgian development agency (VVOB), involved {{in the implementation of}} educational development projects. It explores some of the structural causes of the perceived learning deficit at the project and the agency-wide level, and links it with similar findings in other development agencies. For the project level, two case studies in Zimbabwe (ZimPATH and St 2 eep) were selected in which the project’s management invested significantly in team learning. These practices were put against the learning support activities that the head office was catering for. The study follows a qualitative case-study design inspired by phronetic-based research (Flyvbjerg, 2001), and utilises a mixed method approach to data collection involving a variety of research instruments. The author of the thesis worked in different positions in the field and in the head office (1997 - 2007). An improved version of the concept of learning patterns (Sterck, 2004) is introduced to gain insights in the tenacity of learning practices. It is derived from an in-depth analysis of the underlying characteristics of the formal and informal learning activities. Important drivers of the observed learning patterns are argued to be axiological in nature. These result in strongly diverging views about why learning should happen, what should be learned, and how learning should be organised. These views are captured and analysed through a newly constructed concept, the learning support framework. The findings for project level learning are multiple and point at the importance of both intra-organisational and external factors. The working environment of the two case study projects was characterised by internal (micro-political) and external (institutional and socio-economic) sources of pressure that seriously complicated learning processes. However, evidence is provided that both project teams managed to develop powerful learning processes. The ‘situated’ learning patterns of ZimPATH and St 2 eep shared a view of learning as a strategy to deal with the complexity of work. Knowledge was regarded as a process, with a focus on knowledge creation and the use of local knowledge. Both projects integrated learning in their daily practice via the extensive use of social learning practices and by creating conducive conditions for implicit learning. The bulk of these practices was going under the radar in the head office. It treated implicit learning rather passively and it hardly addressed the structural factors hindering such learning. As a consequence, teams without skills and insights into workplace learning were largely left on their own. The analysis of agency-wide learning in VVOB confirms research that indicates that ‘tacit knowledge does not travel easily’ (Gertler, 2003, p. 84). The strong bias towards vertical learning processes, ICT-solutions and the codification of knowledge created a bureaucratic learning pattern. It did not stop VVOB from entering into a profound crisis. A severe institutional <b>emergency,</b> <b>triggered</b> by external pressure of back donors and institutional partners in the years 2005 and 2006, together with changes in the management brought the momentum for change. The resulting improvements in learning at the field level were, however, not replicated for agency-wide learning. This is linked in the thesis with a lack of ‘institutional proximity’ (Gertler, 2003). Initiatives introducing changes in existing learning practices are deemed to face fierce resistance unless they take into account crucial internal factors (such as the configuration of views, interests and history with regard to knowledge and learning), and various external causes of pressure. An alternative 3 step approach is proposed. In conclusion, unless development agencies and back-donors become more responsive towards the challenges of sharing tacit knowledge across organisational, institutional, cultural and power divides, projects like ZimPATH and St 2 eep are likely to remain pockets of innovation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} participants' response to the sudden appearance of a fire emergency in a virtual environment (VE) and of the adaptivity of their response pattern. A VE has been built in which participants meet two situations: first an explorative navigation and afterwards a hurried escape from the unexpected outbreak of fire. Fire intensity and participants' distance from the exit at the outbreak of fire have been varied as well, to create different degrees of danger and different degrees of difficulty in the task of leaving the premises. Participants' action has been collected automatically for quantitative analysis by registering each individual activation of the interaction devices (a triple button joystick). In addition, the movements in both virtual and real environment of additional groups of participants have been videorecorded for qualitative analysis. Results show that {{the appearance of the}} fire <b>emergency</b> <b>triggers</b> important changes in the way people move in the VE, and that such changes are all adaptive responses to an emergency situation.

40|$|In {{the years}} since September 11, 2001, {{scholars}} have advocated two main positions {{on the role of}} law and the proper balance of powers among the branches of government in emergencies. This Article critiques these two approaches-which could be called Legalism and Decisionism-and offers a third way. Debates between Legalism and Decisionism turn on (1) whether emergencies can be governed by prescribed legal norms; and (2) what the balance of powers among the three branches of government should be in emergencies. Under the Legalist approach, legal norms can and should guide governmental response to emergencies, and the executive branch is constrained by law in emergencies. In contrast, under the Decisionist approach, legal norms cannot respond to all emergencies, and therefore the executive branch is and should be the primary decision-maker in emergencies. Legalists emphasize the importance in emergencies of norms, and Decisionists emphasize the importance in emergencies of decisions. This Article shows not only the disagreements between Legalism and Decisionism but also the three key political assumptions that they often share. First, they agree that <b>emergencies</b> <b>trigger</b> a necessity for security measures that may curtail civil liberties. Second, they perceive public enemies as distinct from private enemies. Third, they share the view that the primary goal of the state and its laws is the prevention of future catastrophes. This Article offers an alternative approach, which I call 2 ̆ 2 Humanist Decisionism. 2 ̆ 2 Humanist Decisionism departs from both Legalism and Decisionism in its attempt to replace the prevailing politics of necessity, enmity, and catastrophe with a politics of friendship and hospitality. This approach has normative implications for the desirability of the legal distinction between public and private enemies, for the level of judicial scrutiny regarding the existence of an emergency, and for the possibility of adopting political and legal measures of friendship and hospitality towards the so-called enemy...|$|R
