5|$|The {{choice of}} {{surgical}} versus non-surgical treatments for osteochondritis dissecans is controversial. Consequently, {{the type and}} extent of surgery necessary varies based on patient age, severity of the lesion, and personal bias of the treating surgeon—entailing an exhaustive list of suggested treatments. A variety of surgical options exist {{for the treatment of}} persistently symptomatic, intact, partially detached, and completely detached OCD lesions. Post-surgery reparative cartilage is inferior to healthy hyaline cartilage in <b>glycosaminoglycan</b> concentration, histological, and immunohistochemical appearance. As a result, surgery is often avoided if non-operative treatment is viable.|$|E

25|$|HA is a bulky, {{negatively}} charged <b>glycosaminoglycan,</b> whose strong affinity with water procures HA its viscoelastic and shock absorbing properties essential to vocal biomechanics. Viscosity and elasticity {{are critical to}} voice production. Chan, Gray and Titze, quantified the effect of HA on both the viscosity and the elasticity of vocal folds (VF) by comparing the properties of tissues with and without HA. The results showed that removal of HA decreased the stiffness of VF {{by an average of}} 35%, but increased their dynamic viscosity by an average of 70% at frequencies higher than 1Hz. Newborns have been shown to cry an average of 6.7 hours per day during the first 3 months, with a sustained pitch of 400–600Hz, and a mean duration per day of 2 hours. Similar treatment on adult VF would quickly result in edema, and subsequently aphonia. Schweinfurth and al. presented the hypothesis that high hyaluronic acid content and distribution in newborn VF is directly associated with newborn crying endurance. These differences in newborn vocal fold composition would also be responsible for newborns inability to articulate sounds, besides the fact that their lamina propria is a uniform structure with no vocal ligament. The layered structure necessary for phonation will start to develop during the infancy and until the adolescence.|$|E
2500|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix of the VF LP {{is composed of}} fibrous proteins such as collagen and elastin, and interstitial molecules such as HA, a non-sulfated [...] <b>glycosaminoglycan.</b> While the SLP is rather poor in elastic and collagenous fibers, the ILP and DLP are mostly composed of it, with the concentration of elastic fibers decreasing and the concentration of collagenous fibers increasing as the vocalis muscle is approached. Fibrous proteins and interstitial molecules play different roles within the ECM. While collagen (mostly type I) provides strength and structural support to the tissue, which are useful to withstanding stress and resisting deformation when subjected to a force, elastin fibers bring elasticity to the tissue, allowing it to return to its original shape after deformation. Interstitial proteins, such as HA, plays important biological and mechanical roles in the VF tissue. In the VF tissue, HA plays a role of shear-thinner, affecting the tissue viscosity, space-filler, shock absorber, as well as wound healing and cell migration promoter. The distribution of those proteins and interstitial molecules has been proven {{to be affected by}} both age and gender, and is maintained by the fibroblasts.|$|E

40|$|We have {{described}} methodology for the isolation and quantitation of <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> present in human plasma. Plasma <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> can be quantitatively adsorbed on a DEAE-Sephacel ion exchanger and eluted with a salt gradient as two groups: a low-charge fraction and a high-charge fraction. The low-charge fraction consists of chondroitin sulfate {{with a low}} sulfate content and the high-charge fraction consists of heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and keratan sulfate (type I). We have determined the plasma concentration {{of each of these}} <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> in six normal human subjects. We have established that none of the <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> in plasma are covalently linked to plasma proteins. All are isolated as complexes with plasma proteins in noncovalent linkages. The <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> in the low-charge fraction are bound with high affinity to a single plasma glycoprotein by a lectin-type bond that can be disrupted by a simple glycoside. The high-charge fraction contains three major proteins and several minor proteins associated with the <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> by both lectin-type and ionic bonding. The plasma proteins associated with <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> represent less than 0. 5 % of the total plasma proteins. Little is known about the physiologic role of the plasma <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> as components of metabolic processes. Because <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> have been implicated in lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis, we tested all of these compounds, isolated in free form, on the in vitro hydrolysis of triglycerides by lipoprotein lipase. Plasma heparan sulfate stimulated the rate of this reaction severalfold. All other plasma <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> were inactive. Thus, plasma heparan sulfate may {{play an important role in}} plasma lipoprotein metabolism...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of the conformation of globular proteins and <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> in high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was studied. <b>Glycosaminoglycans</b> (heparin, chondroitin sulphate and dermatan sulphate) with different primary structures, sulphate-to-carboxyl ratios and physico-chemical properties were extracted and purified. Their physico-chemical properties and purity were evaluated by several analytical techniques. <b>Glycosaminoglycans</b> with different relative molecular masses (M(r)) were prepared by a chemical depolymerization process. These heteropolysaccharides were evaluated by HPSEC and compared with globular proteins of known relative molecular mass. The two third-degree polynomial regression curves for proteins and <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> have different coefficients and the columns present different exclusion limits. In particular, under the experimental conditions, the M(r) exclusion limits for high M(r) are 44 000 for <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> and 240 000 for globular proteins. In contrast, the behaviours of these two classes of macromolecules are similar for lower M(r). In fact, the two third-degree polynomial curves show the same regression below about M(r) = 1000.

5000|$|Proteoglycans are {{proteins}} that are heavily glycosylated. The basic proteoglycan unit {{consists of a}} [...] "core protein" [...] {{with one or more}} covalently attached <b>glycosaminoglycan</b> (GAG) chain(s). The point of attachment is a serine (Ser) residue to which the <b>glycosaminoglycan</b> is joined through a tetrasaccharide bridge (e.g. chondroitin sulfate-GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-PROTEIN). The Ser residue is generally in the sequence -Ser-Gly-X-Gly- (where X can be any amino acid residue but proline), although not every protein with this sequence has an attached <b>glycosaminoglycan.</b> The chains are long, linear carbohydrate polymers that are negatively charged under physiological conditions due to the occurrence of sulfate and uronic acid groups.

40|$|<b>Glycosaminoglycans</b> are linear heteropolysaccharites with a {{characteristic}} sequence of disaccharides: one hexosamine (D-glucosamine or galactosamine) and one uronic acid (D- glucuronic or iduronic). The most important <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> are chondroitin sulphate, dermatan sulphate, keratan sulphate, heparin, heparan sulphate and hyaluronic acid. <b>Glycosaminoglycans</b> are polyanionic hydrophilic molecules involved in cellular adhesion and migration {{as well as}} cellular proliferation and tissular development, structuring and restructuring. <b>Glycosaminoglycans</b> are usually bound to a protein core to form the proteoglycans, they constitute {{a major component of}} the extracellular matrix, the cellular membrane and the cytosol while being also detected in the serum and urine. The concentration of <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> in the serum of healthy adults is mainly modified with physical activity. Further more the serum concentration is modified (increased or decreased level) in a large number of diseases including autoimmune inflammatory and neoplastic diseases, reflecting the altered tissular metabolism of <b>glycosaminoglycans.</b> Several viruses have been studied in vitro to be able to bind the <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> of the cellular membrane, including HCV and several other flavo-viruses. The HIV 1 binding to the cellular membrane <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> is a decisive step for the cellular adhesion of the virus on the target cell surface. Further more, the inhibitory effect of exogenous <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> on the cellular adhesion and viral entry has been studied in vitro as well as the inhibitory action of chondroitine sulphate of the maternal milk. In this study the concentration of serum <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> has been measured in 78 patients with HIV infection and 29 controls. The measurement has been effectuated according to the Bitter and Muir method used to measure uronic acid after delipidation, according to Hata, and isolation.

40|$|<b>Glycosaminoglycans</b> {{are able}} to bind many growth factors and {{adhesive}} proteins, which affect cell activities such as adhesion, migration, growth and differentiation. Chondroitin sulphate, hyaluronan, sulphated hyaluronan and heparin were oxidised here (aldehyde <b>glycosaminoglycans)</b> to generate aldehydes on vicinal hydroxyl groups of the uronic monomers of <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> for subsequent direct covalent binding to amino-terminated model substrata. The properties of modified surfaces were monitored by water contact angle, zeta potential, ellipsometry measurements and atomic force microscopy showing successful immobilisation of aldehyde <b>glycosaminoglycans.</b> Wetting properties and zeta potentials were related to sulphate content of aldehyde <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> with aldehyde heparin as most wettable and negative surface and aldehyde hyaluronan as the least. The thickness of surface layers measured by ellipsometry indicated a predominant side-on immobilisation of all aldehyde <b>glycosaminoglycans.</b> Atomic force microscopy studies showed that immobilisation of aldehyde hyaluronan lead to a rather smooth surface coating while immobilisation of sulphated aldehyde <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> was characterised by a globular appearance of surfaces with higher roughness. The experiments with human fibroblast studying adhesion under serum-free conditions were carried out to learn about bioactivity of aldehyde <b>glycosaminoglycans.</b> It was observed {{that the increase in}} sulphation degree of aldehyde <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> was accompanied by increased adhesion and spreading of cells with stronger expression of focal adhesions and cytoskeletal structures. By contrast, cell adhesion and spreading were lower on aldehyde hyaluronan. Immunofluorescence staining of cells in contact with aldehyde hyaluronan revealed a stronger expression of CD 44, which can represent an alternative route of cell adhesion.

Regarding the different clinicopathological factors, urinary <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> and MMP- 7 showed significant increase with the histological grades and clinical stages (p <  0. 05, p <  0. 05 respectively). The best cut-off values for <b>glycosaminoglycans</b> and MMP- 7 determined by Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were 67. 5  μg/mg creatinine and 10. 05  ng/mg creatinine respectively.
