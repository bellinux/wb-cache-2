On 12 April 2007, the deal was back on track with Jet Airways agreeing to pay [...] On 16 April 2007, Air Sahara was renamed as JetLite and was marketed between a low-cost carrier and a full service airline. JetLite became a wholly owned subsidiary of Jet Airways. In August 2008, Jet Airways {{announced its}} plans to integrate JetLite into Jet Airways. In October 2008, Jet Airways laid off 1,900 of its employees, who were later re-instated due to intervention from the Ministry of Civil Aviation. In October 2008, Jet Airways entered into an alliance with rival Kingfisher Airlines for code-sharing on domestic and international flights, collaboration on frequent-flyer program and sharing crew and <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> <b>equipment.</b> On 8 May 2009, Jet Airways launched another low-cost brand, Jet Konnect.

25|$|The Aeroscraft’s {{cargo system}} {{provides}} the aircraft with unmatched volume and flexibility when deploying cargo to virtually any {{point on the}} planet, empowering the aircraft to pick-up and off-load cargo in more efficient ways, even from hover.

The system affixes containers and cargo pallets to rails in the fuselage ceiling, rather than on the floor; adjusts cargo positioning to accommodate changes in center of gravity, such as when other cargo is loaded and unloaded; facilitates access to any piece of cargo at any time, eliminating unneeded cargo movements and reducing ground time; and eliminates labor costs with traditional cargo handling and weight-and-balance requirements.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2011. <b>Ground</b> <b>handling</b> {{is a key}} {{component}} of the air transport logistics supply chain as it facilitates the mobility of cargo and people from one destination to another. <b>Ground</b> <b>handling</b> facilitates international trade hence its existence is critical to the competitiveness of a nation. Airline businesses usually overshadow <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> due to the historical dominance of airlines in the aviation industry. The importance and effectiveness of the <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> function as part of the air transport business is fast becoming a global issue as the industry is slowly emerging. The following tenets of <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> are fast becoming key issues in the air transport business: passenger handling, cargo handling, handling ramp <b>handling,</b> baggage <b>handling,</b> <b>equipment,</b> safety, security, and human resources. <b>Ground</b> <b>handling</b> players are mainly concerned with productivity, profitability and maximising returns on investment. Dwindling revenue, unsustainable profit margins, low productivity and low customer satisfaction and loyalty are terms no shareholder or business leader wants to hear. This research will give insight into <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> best practices that are a panacea for the industry. The <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> business is time sensitive and requires massive investment. Therefore, sustainable best practices are the right ingredient for customer loyalty and business success. The focus on <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> in South Africa and Zimbabwe will help in assessing the level of development in each country. This will aid in recommending best practices for the industry taking into account different country-specific risks and operational conditions. There are few studies in the field of <b>ground</b> <b>handling</b> and it is an industry not many individuals know about. Many ground-handling executives admit that the industry absorbed them by accident and not by design. They only realise the importance of the industry when they are in it. This research is a practical study meant to bring out solutions to the industry...|$|R

40|$|A key {{task in the}} {{material}} handling system design process is the selection and configuration of equipment for material transport and storage in a facility. Material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection is a complex, tedious task, and there are few tools other than checklists to assist engineers {{in the selection of}} appropriate, cost-effective material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment.</b> This paper describes the development of an intelligent material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection system called material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection advisor (MHESA). The MHESA is composed of three modules: (1) a database to store equipment types with their specifications; (2) a knowledge-based expert system for assisting material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection; and (3) an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model to choose the most favorable equipment type. The concept proposed in this paper can automate the design of a material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection system, and provides artificial intelligence in the decision-making process. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The Piaggio P- 180 Avanti, a twin pusher-prop engine nine-passenger {{business}} {{aircraft was}} certified in 1990, {{to the requirements}} of FAR Part 23 and Associated Special Conditions for Composite Structure. Certification included the application of a damage tolerant methodology to the design of the composite forward wing and empennage (vertical fin, horizontal stabilizer, tailcone, and rudder) structure. This methodology included an extensive analytical evaluation coupled with sub-component and full-scale testing of the structure. The work from the Damage Tolerance Analysis Assessment was incorporated into the full-scale testing. Damage representing hazards such as dropped tools, <b>ground</b> <b>equipment,</b> <b>handling,</b> and runway debris, was applied to the test articles. Additional substantiation included allowing manufacturing discrepancies to exist unrepaired on the full-scale articles and simulated bondline failures in critical elements. The importance of full-scale testing in the critical environmental conditions and the application of critical damage are addressed. The implication of damage tolerance on static and fatigue testing is discussed. Good correlation between finite element solutions and experimental test data was observed...|$|R

40|$|Large-scale {{handling}} of particulate solids can cause severe wear on bulk solids <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> surfaces. Wear reduces equipment life span and increases maintenance cost. Examples of traditional methods to reduce wear of bulk solids <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> include optimizing transport operations and utilizing resistant materials. To our knowledge, the so-called bionic design {{has not been}} utilized. Bionic design is the application of biological models, systems, or elements to modern engineering. Bionic design has promoted significant progress {{on the development of}} engineering products and systems. In order to use bionic design for wear reduction of bulk solids <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> surfaces, this paper introduces bionic design to bulk solids handling on the basis of analogies between biology and bulk solids handling. In addition, a bionic design methodology for the wear reduction of bulk solids <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> surfaces is formulated.

40|$|Container {{terminals}} mainly {{include three}} types of <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> i. e.; quay cranes (QCs), internal trucks (ITs) and yard cranes (YCs). Due to high cost of the <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> container terminals can hardly purchase additional <b>handling</b> <b>equipment.</b> Therefore, the reasonable scheduling of these <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> especially coordinated scheduling of the {{three types of}} <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> {{plays an important role in}} the service level and energy-saving of container terminal. This paper addresses the problem of integrated QC scheduling, IT scheduling and YC scheduling. Firstly, this problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming model (MIP), where the objective is to minimize the total departure delay of all vessels and the total transportation energy consumption of all tasks. Furthermore, an integrated simulation-based optimization method is developed for solving the problem, where the simulation is designed for evaluation and optimization algorithm is designed for searching solution space. The optimization algorithm integrates genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, where the GA is used for global search and the PSO is used for local search. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can coordinate the scheduling of {{the three types of}} <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> and can realize the optimal trade-off between time-saving and energy-saving...|$|R
