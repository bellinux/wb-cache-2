Levine, EUI; Prof. Franklin Allen, Imperial College London; Prof. Cristina Arellano, Federal Reserve Bank of MinneapolisThis thesis {{addresses}} two phenomena, {{which are}} commonly {{observed in the}} financial markets but so far have received relatively little attention in the literature. By putting these issues into a theoretical framework I provide a deeper understanding of their mechanisms as well as their possible impact on the market as a whole. The aim of {{the first part of the}} thesis is to provide a rationale why informed traders {{in the financial markets}} voluntarily share information with others. The success of online chatting platforms within the financial service industry shows that traders very much like to communicate with each other. Standard theory however suggests that by sharing information, traders reduce their informational advantage and thus decrease their profits. The aim of this work is to reconciliate theory with the facts by providing an explanation on why sharing information could be profitable for traders as well as to investigate the effects of information sharing on the market as a whole. The second part of the thesis analyses the role of credit insurance on debt renegotiation. During the renegotiation of private debt in Greece it has become apparent that the existence of credit insurance significantly changes investor behavior when it comes to their willingness to accept a deal. This article explores the impact of credit insurance on the bargaining process as well as how it changes lending conditions for the <b>issuer</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> [...] 1.

25|$|A {{credit rating}} agency (CRA, also called a ratings service) {{is a company}} that assigns credit ratings, which rate a debtor's ability to pay back debt by making timely {{interest}} payments and the likelihood of default. An agency may rate the creditworthiness <b>of</b> <b>issuers</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> obligations, <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> instruments, and in some cases, of the servicers <b>of</b> the underlying <b>debt,</b> but not <b>of</b> individual consumers.|$|R
25|$|Credit rating {{agencies}} assess the relative credit risk <b>of</b> specific <b>debt</b> securities or structured finance instruments and borrowing entities (<b>issuers</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt),</b> {{and in some}} cases the creditworthiness of governments and their securities.

These functions may increase the supply of available risk capital in the market and promote economic growth.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the main factors for the maturity structure <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> based on theories relating to market imperfections, and also to understand the <b>debt</b> profile <b>of</b> large Brazilian companies, owners <b>of</b> bank <b>debt</b> and <b>issuers</b> <b>of</b> debentures. The sample consists of 38 large Brazilian companies, <b>issuers</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt,</b> analyzed between 2002 and 2007, using econometric cross-section techniques and panel data to test the hypotheses concerning the maturity structure <b>of</b> Brazilian company <b>debt.</b> The Growth opportunity (OPOCR), Net operating revenue (LNROL), Leverage (ALAV), Asset maturity (MATA) and High Rating (RATA) variables provided statistically significant results. However, the opposite sign was presented, diverging from the theory's hypotheses. Analyzing this based on the theoretical reference raised, it was observed that only the Effective tax rate (TAXE) variable influences debt maturity behavior...|$|R

We {{show that}} lenders make price {{concessions}} {{for the right}} to resell loans and reveal a strong countervailing association between the ex ante probability of loan resale and the initial loan spreads. We disentangle the side effects (reduced monitoring) from the benefits (enhanced liquidity) brought by the secondary loan resales. The average net impact of simultaneously reducing the probability of the presence of resale constraint and raising the probability of resale across the full sample is to lower spreads by 14 basis points. On balance, the secondary loan market provides clear benefits to the <b>issuers</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> JEL Classification: G 32 1...|$|R

40|$|Credit Rating Agencies play a {{key role}} in European capital markets today, {{publishing}} ratings on the creditworthiness <b>of</b> issuers/issues <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> securities. Independent, objective and internationally consistent credit ratings raise the integrity, transparency and competitiveness of capital markets, lower the costs <b>of</b> capital for <b>issuers</b> and contribute to investor protection. Moreover, ratings are widely used by investors as a guide to the creditworthiness <b>of</b> the <b>issuers</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt,</b> and in financial covenants. As a result, credit rating agencies play a major role not only in the pricing <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> securities, but also in the regulatory process. It may well happen, in fact, that regulators co-opt rating agencies as information-producing agents for regulatory purposes. In this way, when ratings serve not just as a tool for investors but become the very foundation for regulation, they become extremely powerful, and as a consequence, the risk that conflicts of interest will arise becomes much sharper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Credit {{contagion}} {{arises when}} a company is in economic distress or if it defaults. The default of a company will have implications for any firm that is economically connected to this given company. The effect of the default, and thus {{the effect of the}} credit contagion, depends on which economic relation the defaulting company has with other firms. Default is an element of credit risk. Modeling credit risk is importaint {{when it comes to the}} modeling of derivative pricing, such as the prices of credit default swaps, (CDS), and collateral debt obligations, (CDO). These forms of derivatives have been largely talked about during the latest financial crisis since, among others, credit rating agencies (which evaluate the default probability <b>of</b> <b>issuers</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> securities) failed to adequately account for large risks when rating these products. There are roughly two approaches to model credit risk; structural modeling and intensity based modeling. In the intensity based models (also known as reduced form models) default is typically described as a jump time of a jump process (for instance a Poisson process). This thesis is looking at one contagion model in discrete time and one in continuous time, where both are intensity based models. ...|$|R
40|$|Internationalization enables {{multinational}} corporations (MNCs) to diversify their source and type <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> {{as well as}} earnings, although doing so incurs agency costs <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> and business risk. To mitigate these costs, existing studies find that MNCs typically have lower levels <b>of</b> long-term <b>debt</b> than domestic corporations (DCs). One key limitation of these studies is their failure to recognize the heterogeneity <b>of</b> <b>debt,</b> specifically the equity options embedded in the debt issued by MNCs. We show that {{in the presence of}} agency costs <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> and business risk, MNCs are able to mitigate the negative effects on long-term debt by utilizing convertible debt in their debt structure, as compared to DCs. Therefore, MNCs are able to sustain higher levels <b>of</b> long-term <b>debt</b> to make the most from international diversification. Relatively, the significance of business risk is found to out weigh the significance of agency costs as MNCs further increase their degree of internationalization. Evidence also shows that the <b>issuers</b> <b>of</b> convertible <b>debt</b> are not dominated by smaller and riskier growth firms, but is linked to internationalization...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the role of non-state actors in the {{regulation}} of risks. Regulation, conceptualised in this thesis as revolving around the anticipation and management of risks in economic life, is no longer {{considered to be a}} purely state-based activity, but is increasingly viewed as an activity that can involve a variety of actors including nonstate actors such as civic organisations and commercial firms. The limits on the ability of states to regulate risks on their own {{are becoming more and more}} visible in today’s integrated and interdependent markets. Our thinking about the capacity of the state to control is especially challenged by transnational risks, such as exemplified by the global financial crisis of 2007 - 08. Transnational risks easily spread across national borders. However, our knowledge about how non-state actors may be and can be involved in the regulation of risks, at both national and transnational levels, is predominantly theoretical and needs to be examined more critically and above all empirically. In this thesis a case study is presented of the credit rating industry. The credit rating industry has recurrently been identified as an important industry with regard to helping manage credit risk in the global debt capital markets. Using data collected through a documentary survey and 31 semi-structured interviews with current and former staff of rating agencies, this thesis explores the extent to which the credit rating industry is involved in three main components of a risk regulation regime: standard-setting, information-gathering, and behaviour-modification. The thesis will show that there are strong indicators that the credit rating industry is exercising regulation even though rating agencies expressly deny being a regulatory actor. It will discuss the ways in which rating agencies set standards of credit risk, gather and analyse vast amounts of information to assess how <b>issuers</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> measure up to these standards, and aim to influence the behaviour <b>of</b> actors in <b>debt</b> capital markets through their rating processes and the credit ratings that they publish...|$|R

40|$|The {{studies in}} this thesis {{contribute}} to a growing stream of papers showing that capital structure decisions are not only influenced by corporate determinants, but also by fluctuations in investor tastes and capital available for investment. This {{is a relatively new}} way of looking at corporate decisions, but is also given the deserved importance in the literature. This view contrasts with the traditional approach in the literature that largely considered corporate decisions to be distinct from the decision process of investors. Chapters 2 and 3 use convertible debt issuance to analyze the impact of intertemporal variation in investor demand on corporate decisions, and the market reaction to these decisions. Chapter 2 shows that convertible debt issuance, pricing, and design decisions are influenced by demand forces from investors. Chapter 3 finds that a shift in the convertible bond investor base from long-only investors towards convertible arbitrage funds resulted in an increasingly negative stock price reaction, induced by short-selling pressure. Thus, the first two studies {{in this thesis}} provide more evidence of corporate opportunism, using data on <b>issuers</b> <b>of</b> convertible <b>debt.</b> The fourth chapter uses data from repeat <b>issuers</b> <b>of</b> equity, and provides evidence in line with the hypothesis that investors take opportunism into account when firms issue new equity. In addition, the paper shows that firms’ choice of capital structure is influenced by their past behavior...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{whether and}} the extent to which investors respond to the Rule 144 A debt offering through firm’s stock returns. We conduct an event study methodology with 1, 244 Rule 144 A debt offerings from 1990 to 2012 to answer this question. We find that the announcements of Rule 144 A debt offerings are associated with significant negative abnormal returns and these negative effects are more pronounced for the first-time <b>issuers</b> <b>of</b> 144 A <b>debt.</b> On average, 144 A debt issuers make a loss of 9. 5 basis points (US$ 28. 6 million) from the amount <b>of</b> 144 A <b>debt</b> raised. However, we find a reversal effect on abnormal returns following the registration <b>of</b> 144 A <b>debt</b> after 60 days from the issue date. Our findings suggest that ignoring the sample selection bias <b>of</b> 144 A <b>debt</b> issuance choice can lead to erroneous conclusions that 144 A debt does not affect firm’s abnormal returns. In addition, we also find that firms in larger financial deficit tend to issue 144 A debt...|$|R

40|$|During {{the decade}} 1983 - 1992, {{approximately}} 1. 4 trillion dollars of municipal bonds {{were sold in}} 87 thousand separate issues, primarily to finance capital projects for education, electric power, transportation, health care, housing and other public and private purpose activities. Approximately two-thirds of these financings were originated by financing authorities, quasi-government agencies which are the creation of state legislatures. Despite the growing role played by quasi-public authorities in capital finance, their impacts have not been studied systematically. We first describe the <b>issuers</b> <b>of</b> tax-exempt <b>debt</b> in the health sector and then derive measures for describing the mix <b>of</b> <b>issuers</b> between state and local levels, and between both government and quasi-government sectors. We present abbreviated test results of the impact that different mixes have {{on the cost of}} capital. First, competition is good: using a Herfindahl index analysis we show that states with less concentrated issuers have a lower cost of capital than those with a more concentrated market, including state-level finance monopolies. On the other hand, we cannot assert unequivocally that market deconcentration in and of itself should be a goal. For instance, there are economies of scale in the health care finance industry that allow larger (often state-level) issuers to lower the cost of capital. ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a set of}} hand-collected data, I {{study the}} {{economic}} consequences of APB 14 - 1, adopted in 2008, which requires that <b>issuers</b> <b>of</b> cash-settled convertible <b>debt</b> divide the total proceeds from the issuances into liability and equity components (“bifurcation”). First, I find that issuers {{are more likely to}} reduce the outstanding amount <b>of</b> cash-settled convertible <b>debt</b> when the increase (decrease) in interest expense (leverage ratio) resulting from the bifurcation process is higher (lower). The probability of early repurchase is higher when mandatory accounting changes are included in the calculation <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> covenant compliance. This finding is consistent with the debt contracting hypothesis that APB 14 - 1 increases the probability <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> covenant violations. Next, I examine whether credit rating agencies evaluate the issuers’ accounting information differently after the adoption of APB 14 - 1. I find that the financial ratios in the post- 2008 period, such as interest coverage ratios and leverage ratios, can better explain the issuers’ credit ratings than those in the pre- 2008 period. Finally, I find that shareholders of cash-settled convertible bond issuers experience an overall loss of wealth of 2. 1 % associated with APB 14 - 1. The negative shareholder reactions are greater when issuers use rolling GAAP in their bank loan agreements to calculate debt covenant compliance than if they do not. These empirical results are consistent with the notion that mandatory changes in financial reporting <b>of</b> cash-settled convertible <b>debt</b> have real effects on managerial behavior and the usefulness of information from financial statements used by the credit market...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} the importance of the banking credit risk, the main elements that conform it and the main alternatives that are offered to access to a loan as well as a description of its measurement and management in the sector. There will be a general explanation of credit risk and the main parties involved in it. As the topic is developed it is going to be analyzed the lending process carried out by the banks as well as the quantitative and qualitative elements taken into account when taking a credit decision (The 5 C’s of credit, credit scoring and models for quantification of losses for instance). Another thing to considerate is that Credit risk arises whenever a borrower is expecting to use future cash flows to pay a current debt. Also, the investors have the access for the information of a client and they are compensated for assuming credit risk by way of interest payments from the borrower or <b>issuer</b> <b>of</b> a <b>debt</b> obligation and the credit risk is a useful tool for the finance management.

40|$|The role {{of credit}} ratings {{agencies}} (CRAs) is to forecast {{the probability that}} the <b>issuer</b> <b>of</b> a <b>debt</b> liability will default on the due repayment (its probability of default, PD). In this respect, CRAs are one of a large set of institutions and people who seek to forecast certain aspects of the future. As a generality, the only, or at any rate the most important, requisite of a forecast is its accuracy. So long as the forecast is accurate, it is largely beside the point how the forecaster behaves otherwise, whether they lead a blameless life, or alternatively are rude to their parents, beat their children or cheat on their spouses, etc. Moreover, in the case of CRAs, (unlike the Delphic oracle), the forecast is not only relatively clear in content, (though we shall consider later how it could, and should, be made even clearer), but also the status of the event being forecast, i. e. whether the issuer defaults, or not, on due repayment, is also relatively clear – and any remaining fuzziness often becomes subject to a legal decision. So the forecasting activities of CRAs should be susceptible to ex post accountability. Compare forecast with out-turn; assess and publish the comparative accuracy of the various CRAs' and leave competition to do the rest. We shall review what extra steps need to be taken to enhance such ex post accountability, comparing forecast with outcome, and comment briefly on how, perhaps, to enhance competition...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an empirical {{investigation of the}} choice between different sources <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> finance based on a sample of UK non-financial companies listed on the London Stock Exchange FTSE 350 between 2001 and 2008. New evidence is provided on (i) the importance of differentiating between syndicated and bilateral bank loans, and (ii) the impact that bankers sitting {{on the board of}} directors have on the borrowing firms' choice <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> source. The evidence presented in this thesis contributes to the large body of US research concerning a firm's choice <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> source. Initially, the study investigates what type of firm chooses to issue particular sources <b>of</b> <b>debt,</b> and why. The findings show that the primary determinant of a firm's choice <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> source is its ability to provide collateral to secure against its debt. Although there is no evidence of bank affiliation playing a significant role in driving access to the public capital markets or to syndicated loans in the UK, <b>issuers</b> <b>of</b> bilateral loans are found to be more likely to have an affiliation to a bank than <b>issuers</b> <b>of</b> public, syndicated bank or non-bank private debt. Secondly, the study examines the stock market response to announcements of public, bank (both syndicated and bilateral), and non-bank private debt. The results provide no evidence of any abnormal stock market response following announcements of either public bonds or non-bank private debt. There is strong evidence of a positive market response to announcements of bank loans, driven by the positive market response to syndicated loans. There is little evidence of any market response to announcements of bilateral loans. The market appears to view announcements of syndicated loans made by companies which have a banker on their board in a positive manner, but no such response is observed for announcements of bilateral loans.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the role}} of credit rating agencies and their relationship with Constitutions during the global financial crisis. Credit rating agencies {{play an important role}} in the debt market, as their credit ratings are used by investors, borrowers, issuers and governments in order to make informed investment and financing decisions. During the recent financial and economic crisis, rating agencies and, above all, the «three big sisters» (Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch) that control around 95 % of the global ratings market, are considered to have failed to signal early enough the worsening conditions of the market and to adjust their credit ratings following the deepening of the crisis (see Regulation (EU) n. 1060 / 2009). In particular, the paper examines the sovereign credit ratings, that is the credit ratings where the entity rated - the <b>issuer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>debt</b> or financial obligation - is a State, a regional or local authority of a State, or an international organization created by the State. Sovereign credit ratings show deficiencies and potential conflicts with various basic notions of constitutional law (such as State's sovereignty and fundamental rights protection). The publication of sovereign ratings deeply affects the credibility of States, but the rating agencies remain completely unaccountable, even if their ratings have often proven to be inaccurate. Constitutionalism, which is configured as a limit to the exercise of political power, cannot ignore these new forms of influence, aggravated by today's economic crisis - forms of power that cannot longer be qualified as simply «political», but that have also become «economic» and «financial». In this regard, the aim of this article is to advocate that there cannot be power without responsibility, and that this principle should also apply to some of the most powerful actors in the age of globalization, like credit rating agencies...|$|R
