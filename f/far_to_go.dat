5|$|A related {{theme is}} the moral compromises {{individuals}} make in order to succeed in immoral political systems. In an interview about Taking Sides, Szabó said, “I don't think that life is possible without making compromises. The question {{is only one of}} limits: how <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> When one crosses the line, then the compromise starts to be a bad, even deadly, one.” This theme is dominant in the Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, may be related to Szabó’s own collaboration with the Communist secret police.|$|E
25|$|O’Neil's Question is very {{conflicted}} on how <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in enforcing justice, often feeling {{tempted to}} kill. He resists this temptation {{during his time}} in Hub City, realizing {{that part of his}} desire to go so far is just to see {{what it feels like to}} take a life. His relationship with his mentor, Aristotle Rodor, is one of many things that keep him from going over the edge and back towards the darkness he had shown in his youth on the streets of Hub City.|$|E
500|$|The {{writers have}} made Homer's {{intelligence}} appear to decline over the years; they explain {{this was not}} done intentionally, but {{it was necessary to}} top previous jokes. For example, in [...] "When You Dish Upon a Star", (season 10, 1998) the writers included a scene where Homer admits that he cannot read. The writers debated including this plot twist because it would contradict previous scenes in which Homer does read, but eventually they decided to keep the joke because they found it humorous. The writers often debate how <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in portraying Homer's stupidity; one suggested rule is that [...] "he can never forget his own name".|$|E

2500|$|At Melbourne, Park {{had been}} one of the youngsters sent to the [...] "special net" [...] for Armstrong's attention. Armstrong had been impressed, Park awestruck, later {{crediting}} Armstrong with [...] "most of my cricket brains". They were an odd sight in partnership, like a planet and its satellite, but their simpatico was deep. During the match against South Australia, for example, Park joined his captain with an hour left of the second day and shared a thunderous stand. Over lunch on the third day, with Park 226 and himself 101, Armstrong recalled his own eight-year-old record score for Victoria: [...] "Parky, you haven't <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to beat my 250. I promise to do my best to stop there while you make them." [...] Park did not make it, but always remembered the gesture.|$|E
