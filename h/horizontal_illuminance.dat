5000|$|In {{lighting}} design, the lumen method, (also called zonal cavity method), is {{a simplified}} method {{to calculate the}} light level in a room. The method {{is a series of}} calculations that uses <b>horizontal</b> <b>illuminance</b> criteria to establish a uniform luminaire layout in a space. In its simplest form, the lumen method is merely the total number of lumens available in a room divided by the area of the room. [...] In order to perform this calculation, many factors, coefficients, lamp lumen data and other quantities must be gathered. Despite the scientific impression of the lumen method equations, there are inaccuracies and assumptions built into the method. Therefore, the lumen method should not typically be used as a standalone, final solution; it should be used as a tool in particularly uniform settings of lighting design if a simple, rough technique of illuminance quantification is desired.|$|E

40|$|Overcrowding in the {{perimeter}} zone is an inevitable issue in residential rooms with limited space. Obstructions, such as furniture and household items, may block the existing windows, and therefore affect interior daylight conditions. A facade design approach is needed that simultaneously {{takes into account}} daylighting and the volume of usable space for obstructions in {{the perimeter}} zone of such rooms. This study simulates daylight distributions in a typical small residential room with obstructions in front of windows. The simulation consists of two parts. First, the effects on <b>horizontal</b> <b>illuminances</b> caused by different positions and shapes of obstructions are examined under an overcast sky. Second, the maximum usable space volumes for obstructions of 51 optimized facade configurations are calculated in terms of four window-to-wall ratios (WWRs). The {{results of this study}} show that optimizing the forms of facade design can increase the usable interior space volume and meet the daylighting requirements of Chinese standards for small residential rooms. Additionally, by using the optimized facade forms, a facade with a WWR value of 50 % provides the maximum usable space for obstructions. Based on the above results, this paper presents two matrices that can help architects in selecting the appropriate fenestration methods and confirming the size of usable space and allocation for residents...|$|R

This study introduced a new method to identify the direct region by comparing the measured diffuse illuminance and the calculated illuminance came from outside the supposed region. As a result, angular distance of the direct region was identified as 10 degree from the sun.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that environmental conditions in classrooms, and namely daylighting conditions, can influence students health, well-being and performance. In the last years several studies, dealing with the effects of environmental conditions in classrooms in the learning process, have been published (Winterbottom, & Wilkins, 2009; Barret, Zhang, Moffat, & Kobbacy, 2013). The daylight factor (DF) is the most used parameter in the characterization and quantification of daylight in buildings. The DF at a point of a plane inside a room is defined as the ratio (expressed as a percentage) between the daylight illuminance at that point in the interior of the room and the simultaneous exterior <b>horizontal</b> global <b>illuminance</b> due to a hemisphere of a sky of known or assumed luminance distribution (usually, a CIE overcast sky luminance distribution is considered). The DF reflects the effectiveness of daylight penetration in a particular room or space. The exterior daylight conditions may vary, but the DF remains constant, since the interior illuminances change proportionally to the simultaneous changes in the exterior daylight conditions (Santos, 2006) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{starting}} point of this work is to review the current recommendations and criteria of road and pedestrian way lighting. At present, the emphasis of traffic safety, the increasing energy costs, and improvements in mesopic photometry have led to new discussions about {{the accuracy of the}} recommendations for road lighting. Sufficient road lighting is generally based on the lighting requirements given in different lighting classes. For road lighting, the value of 2 cd/m 2 is recommended as the minimum average road surface luminance for the highest lighting class in the CIE and CEN publications. The basis of the average road surface luminance for the lower lighting classes is unknown and lacks experimental works. Moreover, the experimental set-ups of the studies conducted in the 1930 s and 1950 s do not meet the conditions of motor traffic lighting nowadays. They also have deficiencies in the number and age distributions of the subjects. The values of the average <b>horizontal</b> <b>illuminances</b> of the pedestrian way lighting recommendations are based on studies conducted in the 1970 s and 1980 s. However, no information exists on how the recommended illuminance values are derived for the different lighting classes. The current recommendations for outdoor lighting are based on photopic photometry, this is daylight visibility conditions. In outdoor lighting, the luminances are in the mesopic range. The CIE recommended system for mesopic photometry should be used in providing recommendations and criteria for both road and pedestrian way lighting. Before implementing mesopic photometry, the adaptation luminance of the road users should be known. This study examined the adaptation conditions of pedestrians based on eye-tracking measurements. A case study in a pedestrian way was conducted in Chongqing of China. The study is related to the currently ongoing task of the CIE JCT- 1 Implementation of CIE 191 System for Mesopic Photometry in Outdoor Lighting, which is to investigate adaptation and viewing conditions and define visual adaptation fields in outdoor lighting. The case study consisted of eye-tracking measurements and subjective evaluations of the lighting conditions. It was found that the eye-fixation areas and locations were around a central area of the road surface in the horizontal level but spread over a wider area in the vertical level. The subjective importance of facial recognition depends on the specific visual tasks at different light levels in a pedestrian way. The results also suggest that further studies using an eye-tracking system could combine eye-fixation data with pupil size and luminance data. This would help in further analysis of visual adaptation fields of the road users...|$|R

Department of Energy GATEWAY Solid-State Lighting Technology Demonstration Program. In this project, eight 100 W (nominal) high-pressure sodium cobra head fixtures were replaced with a like number of LED street light luminaires manufactured by Leotek, Inc. The Leotek product achieved an estimated payback in the Lija Loop installation of about 20 years for replacement scenarios and a much shorter 7. 6 years for new installations. Much of the associated energy savings (55 %) supporting these payback periods, however, were achieved by reducing average <b>horizontal</b> photopic <b>illuminance</b> a similar amount (53 %). Examined from a different perspective, the measured performance suggests that the Leotek product is at approximate parity with the HPS cobra head in terms of average delivered photopic illumination for a given power consumption.

Successful {{daylighting}} in buildings requires trade-offs and optimization between competing design aspects (e. g. light distribution, glare, solar gains, views, etc.), whilst also including consideration of façade layout, space configuration, internal finishes and choice/operation of shading devices. However, to design energy-sustainable built environments which are conducive to human health, these variables have necessarily to be related also with biological and behavioural factors such as metabolic rhythms, psychological stimulation and occupants’ preferences. Basing on a multidisciplinary review of existing literature, this paper looks at the relationship between quantitative physical measures of the luminous environment (e. g. <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>illuminance,</b> luminance ratio, correlated colour temperature), qualitative aspects of vision (e. g. uniformity, distribution), and psycho-physiological human response to natural light.

To understand these consequences, worldwide mapping of skyglow for all weather conditions is urgently required. In particular, the amplification of skyglow by clouds needs to be studied, as clouds can extend the reach of skyglow into remote areas not affected by light pollution on clear nights. Here we use commercial digital single lens reflex cameras with fisheye lenses for all-sky photometry. We track the reach of skyglow from a peri-urban into a remote area on a clear and a partly cloudy night by performing transects from the Spanish town of Balaguer towards Montsec Astronomical Park.

40|$|Most {{available}} techniques for predicting internal daylight illuminance {{do not take}} into account reflected sunlight, nor the fact that under clear sky conditions the direction of the illuminance is usually upwards, not downwards from the sky. The general goal {{of this study is to}} investigate the issue of predicting the internal illuminance from natural light in clear sky conditions. This includes the possibility of proposing a method based on the concept of the average daylight factor for use in sunny climates. This thesis is divided into eight chapters. After introducing the problem in Chapter One, Chapter Two is a literature review of problems associated with utilising natural light in sunny regions. Chapter Three is the statement of the problem and how it will be solved. Existing equations for finding the average daylight factor have one thing in common: they assume that the incident light on the window comes directly from an overcast sky or by external reflection from it. If any of these equations are to be used under clear sky conditions, or a new method is to be developed based on the same concepts, the sensitivity of average internal illuminance to the direction of external light needs to be tested. A study of this is described in Chapter Four. Chapter Five tests, by numerical simulation, the performance of existing average daylight factor methods under clear sky conditions. It is concluded that they are not appropriate for sunny regions. The tests, and the conclusions from Chapter Four, do, however, suggest a new approach. This has two bases. The first is that it has been shown to be possible to relate incident light on the window plane to <b>horizontal</b> sky <b>illuminance,</b> and this sets a minimum condition for window design. In practice this can be used in conjunction with a limiting maximum window size based on heat gain and other environmental issues. The second basis is a new formula for relating average internal illuminance to external window plane illuminance. The overall result is a formula for predicting internal illuminance as a ratio of external horizontal sky iluminance. In Chapter Seven this approach is tested. Two methods are used: field measurements under real sky conditions, and comparison with detailed calculations...|$|R

The former relies on graphical and/or mathematical techniques, e. g. the BRE Protractors, the BRE Tables, Waldram Diagrams, the Pepper-pot diagrams and the BRE formula. The latter tests scale models of buildings under artificial sky conditions (CIE sky). The paper lists {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} both methods in terms of compatibility with the design process, time required, accuracy, energy-consumption facts, and visual information.    This paper outlines a proposal for an alternative method for teaching daylight and artificial lighting design for both architectural students and practitioners.

40|$|Daylight {{illuminance}} uniformity is {{a common}} criterion when assessing the performance of fenestration and solar control. To evaluate a design according to this requirement, a grid of <b>horizontal</b> <b>illuminance</b> readings for a given time is required. In simulation based assessments, this can be calculated by defining sensor points at working plane level and running a simulation for a single time step, or an annual simulation to assess the uniformity for a typical year. Backing such predicted assessments with measured data has been a task involving installation and calibration of sensors, cabling and data acquisition systems, which typically render the assessed space unusable for the time of assessment. Using sequential readings from handheld devices as a convenient alternative ignores the dynamics of daylight, as the sky conditions cannot be assumed constant during {{the time required to}} record the illuminance at the required amount of locations. We propose instantaneous image-based measurements of <b>horizontal</b> <b>illuminance</b> for assessments of daylight uniformity. Instead of cabled sensors, near-Lambertian reflectors are placed at working plane level in the assessed space. High Dynamic Range (HDR) images of the working plane with markers are taken and the luminance of the marker surfaces is extracted from the corresponding pixel values. These luminance values can be used to calculate <b>horizontal</b> <b>illuminance</b> for each marker location, assuming Lambertian reflection.

Two levels of ambient light were used, 100 cd/m 2 and 300 cd/m 2, from two different light sources, both with 4000 K. Half of the group were exposed to light from fluorescent tubes and the other half from LED. All subjects experienced two lighting levels in a balanced design. The results show that the subjects experienced the ambient light from LED as brighter than light from the fluorescent tubes. Furthermore the lights from LED were experienced as more pleasant at the lower lighting level. Lighting quality and energy efficiency will be an essential part in future lighting design. In order to provide lighting quality, ambient lighting plays an important part. Several studies have shown that ambient lighting affects people positively and is also a necessary part in energy efficient lighting design (Loe, 2003, Govén et al, 2011). This study shows that ambient lighting provided by LED may be more efficient without decreasing lighting quality. The results indicate that there are differences in the experience of brightness from reflected light from interior surfaces between LED used in this study and T 5 tubes. This is due to the differences in the spectral distribution in the shorter wavelengths. This must be considered while evaluating measured photometric data. Regarding effects on lighting quality, LED was experienced as most positive at 100 cd/m 2, then at 300 cd/ m 2. LED and the T 5 tubes was experienced equal in lighting quality. This imply that levels around 100 cd/m 2 seems to be the most appropriate ambient light level using LED with a <b>horizontal</b> task <b>illuminance</b> of 500 lux (130 cd/m 2). However, at higher luminance levels on ambient lighting above 300 cd/m 2 there is a risk that LED may be experienced as more glaring than light from T 5 tubes. Our results show an increased positive experience of T 5 tubes from 100 cd/m 2 to 300 cd/m 2 but the experienced quality of LED lighting declined at 300 cd/m 2. Using ambient light in indoor lighting application there may be a possibility to reduce lighting levels {{in the same way as}} in outdoor applications using an experienced brightness correction factor between LED another common used light sources...|$|R
40|$|Purpose In the Netherlands, the {{prevalence}} of visual impairments is the highest among the subgroup of nursing home residents. Over 40 percent are estimated to have visual impairments 1. Older adults experience visual problems due to biological aging or eye disease 2. These problems can affect several visual functions as well as daily functions in general 3, 4. Providing appropriate lighting of sufficient intensity and color temperature (CT), and making use of capabilities of the visual environment {{in the nursing home}} 4 is one of the tasks for professional carers. Light conditions were measured in order to find out to what extent older adults live with the proper lighting conditions. With these data, we wanted to enhance the awareness among care professionals of how light conditions affect the daily lives of the nursing home residents. Moreover, care professionals and technical staff could make the right improvements to the nursing home environment based on the outcomes. Method We assessed light conditions (Konica Minolta chromameter CL- 200) in seven nursing homes in the Netherlands. Light conditions were measured in places where residents {{spend most of their time}} during the day. In total, 59 living rooms and corridors were assessed in this study. <b>Horizontal</b> and vertical <b>illuminances</b> as well as CT were measured and compared to the values given in a guideline by the Dutch Society for Illumination 5. The study was performed between October 2009 and the end of March 2010 at daytime between 10 : 00 and 15 : 00 hours. By measuring in autumn, winter and early spring, the contribution of daylight to the indoor illuminance levels was kept at a minimum. Results & Discussion In general lighting conditions encountered in the nursing homes were poor. Four-fifths of the measured illuminances in the common rooms were below the 1, 000 lx threshold. Illuminances in the corridors fell below the 200 lx threshold in at least three quarters of the measurements. This means that nursing home residents may have difficulty carrying out tasks and could fall during transfers. The CT of light to which nursing home residents were exposed, fell below the reference value for daylight of 5, 000 K with median scores of 3, 400 to 4, 500 K. High CT of light, in combination with higher illuminances, may positively affect the biological clock, resulting in better sleep quantity and quality. Nursing home staff should be aware of these data in order to arrange better light conditions. Technical staff should be aware that lighting guidelines are not specifically developed for older adults. Special attention should be paid to the fact that older adults need more light than younger persons to perform Activities of Daily Living (ADL) ...|$|R
40|$|Advanced façades {{include a}} {{combination}} of active and passive solar shading and daylight harvesting systems to reduce energy demand while maintaining occupant comfort. A comprehensive simulation study was carried out to evaluate the impact of an advanced dynamic shading configuration on the thermal and daylighting performance of building perimeter zones. The studied system consists of a fixed exterior reflective overhang and a movable internal light-shelf in the upper window section as well as controlled bottom-up roller shades in the view aperture. The overhang provides partial exterior shading, blocking solar gains in the summer, and reflects natural light into the room through the upper portion of the façade. The movable internal light-shelf not only blocks sunlight from entering the room through the top window, but also enhances daylight distribution in the room {{as a result of}} deeper natural light penetration. However, if no additional shading is provided for the view aperture, glare and overheating are bound to happen, offsetting the energy benefits, and resulting in occupant discomfort. Controlled bottomup roller shades were therefore employed in the view aperture so as to eliminate direct glare and allow partial view to the outside. The bottom-up controlled shades and the light-shelf are appropriately controlled so as to always block direct sunlight. The study was conducted for a classroom located in Chicago, IL, and the impact of the following parameters on energy demand was investigated: exterior overhang characteristics; interior light shelf position, size, surface reflectance and tilt angle control; roller shade control modes and fabric material properties. ^ In order to accurately model solar gains and exterior luminous sources for the entire year, the façade was split in three variable parts depending on the position of the shades and the relative position of the overhang. In this time-varying 9 -surface enclosure, dynamic view factors were calculated between all surfaces throughout the year. For the thermal analysis, a comprehensive thermal network (heat balance) model was developed, and solved explicitly using the finite difference method to quantify the impact of the above parameters on the building’s thermal loads. A parametric analysis of the studied variables allows for selection of overhang and light shelf characteristics and suitable shade fabric to reduce building energy demand. It was observed that the implementation of the system can result in up to 43 % and 16 % reduction in annual cooling and heating demand respectively. Moreover, peak heating and cooling demands were cut down by 50 % and 32 % in that order. In the daylighting analysis, a multiple bounce radiosity method was used to determine hourly <b>horizontal</b> work plane <b>illuminance</b> and daylight autonomy. Energy savings resulting from the implementation two lighting control strategies (on/off control and continuous dimming) were also evaluated. Compared with standard automated interior roller shades, the studied system provides better natural light distribution, lower contrast ratios and longer periods of view to the outside. Lighting energy savings reached 45 % with on/off electric lighting control, and up to 70 % with continuous dimming control. ...|$|R
