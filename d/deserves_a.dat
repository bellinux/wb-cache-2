5|$|On Cybertron Cyclonus, {{dispatched}} {{from the}} Dead Universe {{on a mission}} to activate the Nega-Core, inadvertently alerts the Autobots to his presence, but is still able to activate the Core, as well as its lethal guardian Thunderwing. On Garrus-9 Prime calls in the Wreckers to deal with the escalating situation as Nemesis Prime leads the forces of the Dead Universe from the Benzuli expanse. Meanwhile, Hardhead accompanies Nightbeat to Gorlam Prime in an attempt to find his missing memories. Attacked by Micromasters, Nightbeat is taken control of by Jhiaxus and Hardhead reluctantly eliminates him, before disappearing into the dimensional portal. A furious Nemesis Prime realizes he must do Nightbeat's job of eliminating Optimus Prime personally. The Wrecker's assault on Thunderwing proves futile, while Arcee teams up with Banzai-Tron to track down the escaped Monstructor, and Jetfire prepares to use Thunderwing's technology to enable other Autobots to survive the effects of the Benzuli expanse. Dealer's attempt to retrieve the Magnificence for himself backfires when a suspicious Hot Rod uses it to confirm his doubts about Dealer, who is promptly killed. Hot Rod then uses the Magnificence to locate the other Nega-Cores and their guardians, (Sixshot and Monstructor), and passes the information on. Jetfire then formulates a plan to override Jhiaxus' control of them via taking over their mental link. Nemesis Prime attacks Optimus on Garrus-9 personally, but is betrayed and killed by Galvatron, who is then tossed into a solar pool by Prime. Jetfire's plan works, as Cloudburst's team, now equipped with Thunderwing's technology, is able to dispose of the Nega-Cores in the Dead Universe, closing it off completely. Jhiaxus is hunted down on Gorlam Prime by Arcee and Hardhead (now undead like the Dead Universe's inhabitants), where his immortality means Arcee can kill him over and over. On Earth, Sideswipe, having beaten Straxus and Grindcore, decides he has proven himself and leaves without Sunstreaker. Over the following years, Gorlam Prime evolves into a new Cybertron, and its inhabitants evolve into beings like Transformers. But on Garrus-9, Galvatron still lives within the solar pool. In the aftermath of this, the former Decepticon assassin Drift, his outlook changed by meeting the legendary third faction of Cybertronians, attempts to rescue Autobot captives from a Decepticon ship, and ends up crossing path with Kup and the Wreckers. An impressed Kup, believing everyone <b>deserves</b> <b>a</b> second chance, offers him a spot on his new commando squad.|$|E

Although there is no evidence for a conscious change of policy, Henry soon embarked on a program of building ships larger than heretofore.

25|$|In his book, The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, {{baseball}} historian Bill James ranked Tenace 23rd all-time among {{major league}} catchers. Chuck Rosciam, a Baseball historian {{and a member}} of the Society for American Baseball Research, believes that Tenace <b>deserves</b> <b>a</b> spot in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Using six offensive measures: Average, On-base percentage, Slugging, RBIs, Runs created and Win shares—all League-Era adjusted, Rosciam ranks Tenace sixth offensively behind Mickey Cochrane, Mike Piazza, Bill Dickey, Gabby Hartnett and Joe Torre among catchers. Tenace is tied for third in OPS (on-base percentage plus slugging percentage) with Johnny Bench and Torre. He's only behind Roy Campanella and Yogi Berra.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, {{the rivalry}} was renewed in another playoff series. In Game 1, Montreal's PK Subban slashed Ottawa's Mark Stone—breaking his wrist—and Subban was later {{kicked out of}} the game. Senators' coach Dave Cameron called the slash vicious and said that Subban <b>deserves</b> <b>a</b> suspension. Ottawa's Clarke MacArthur called it a {{lumberjack}} slash and Mark Stone said that he was being targeted all game. Meanwhile, Michel Therrien said that Subban did not deserve to be ejected and should have only gotten a minor penalty. Montreal won that game 4–3. Both Game 2 and Game 3 were decided in overtime, which were both won by Montreal. Riding a 3–0 lead in the series, Montreal saw Ottawa win the next two games, before closing the series in Game 6 with a 2–0 win in Ottawa.|$|E

25|$|In December, 1997, several Canadian {{police forces}} formed a {{joint task force}} to manage their {{investigation}} into sniper attacks against three Canadian doctors, Romalis of Vancouver; Hugh Short of Ancaster, Ontario; and Jack Fainman of Winnipeg, Manitoba. On the joint task force were representatives of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the police forces of Vancouver, Hamilton, and Winnipeg. The police say that sniper attacks against Canadian physicians are terrorist acts and that {{the hunt for the}} attackers <b>deserves</b> <b>a</b> coordinated national effort. In 2001, James Kopp was charged with the shooting of Dr. Hugh Short and is suspected of committing the other two shootings. Kopp is currently in prison in the USA for the 1998 sniper-style murder of Barnett Slepian, an American physician from Amherst, New York who performed abortions.|$|E
25|$|Pandyas ruled {{initially}} from Korkai, a {{sea port}} on the southernmost {{tip of the}} Indian peninsula, and in later times moved to Madurai. Pandyas are also mentioned in Sangam Literature, {{as well as by}} Greek and Roman sources during this period. Megasthenes in his Indika mentions the Pandyan kingdom. The Pandyas controlled the present districts of Madurai, Tirunelveli, and parts of south Kerala. They had trading contacts with Greece and Rome. With the other kingdoms of Tamilakam, they maintained trading contacts and marital relationships with Tamil merchants from Eelam. Various Pandya kings find mention in a number of poems in the Sangam literature. Among them Nedunjeliyan, 'the victor of Talaiyalanganam' <b>deserves</b> <b>a</b> special mention. Besides several short poems found in the Akananuru and the Purananuru collections, there are two major works—Mathuraikkanci and the Netunalvatai (in the collection of Pattupattu) that give a glimpse into the society and commercial activities in the Pandyan kingdom during the Sangam age. The early Pandyas went into obscurity {{at the end of the}} 3rd century CE during the incursion of the Kalabhras.|$|E
