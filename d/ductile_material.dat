25|$|The {{significant}} asymmetry in {{distribution of}} the impact ejecta indicates that Lofn was formed by an oblique impact. The impactor probably came from the north-west. The shallowness of the crater {{may be related to}} the fragmentation of the impactor prior to the contact with the surface. A cluster of fragments is generally less efficient in excavation of the surface material than a single body. Another reason for the flat floor of Lofn is viscous relaxation of the crust after impact, which implies the existence of a layer of <b>ductile</b> <b>material</b> below the surface at the time of the impact. This soft material may be warm ice or even a subsurface ocean.|$|E
2500|$|Cast iron used in rails proved {{unsatisfactory}} {{because it}} was brittle and broke under heavy loads. The wrought iron invented by John Birkinshaw in 1820 replaced cast iron. Wrought iron (usually simply referred to as [...] "iron") was a <b>ductile</b> <b>material</b> that could undergo considerable deformation before breaking, making it more suitable for iron rails. But iron was expensive to produce until Henry Cort patented the puddling process in 1784. In 1783 Cort also patented the rolling process, which was 15 times faster at consolidating and shaping iron than hammering. These processes greatly lowered the cost of producing iron and rails. The next important development in iron production was hot blast developed by James Beaumont Neilson (patented 1828), which considerably reduced the amount of coke (fuel) or charcoal needed to produce pig iron. Wrought iron was a soft material that contained included slag or dross. The softness and dross tended to make iron rails distort and delaminate and they lasted less than 10 years. Sometimes they lasted as little as one year under high traffic. All these developments {{in the production of}} iron eventually led to replacement of composite wood/iron rails with superior all iron rails.|$|E

Choice of Words.--The art of {{literature}} stands apart from among its sisters, because {{the material in}} which the literary artist works is the dialect of life; hence, on the one hand, a strange freshness and immediacy of address to the public mind, which is ready prepared to understand it; but hence, on the other, a singular limitation. The sister arts enjoy {{the use of a}} plastic and <b>ductile</b> <b>material,</b> like the modeller's clay; literature alone is condemned to work in mosaic with finite and quite rigid words. You have seen these blocks, dear to the nursery: this one a pillar, that a pediment, a third a window or a vase. It is with blocks of just such arbitrary size and figure that the literary architect is condemned to design the palace of his art. Nor is this all; for since these blocks, or words, are the acknowledged currency of our daily affairs, there are here possible none of those suppressions by which other arts obtain relief, continuity and vigour; no hieroglyphic touch, no smoothed impasto, no inscrutable shadow, as in painting; no blank wall, as in architecture; but every word, phrase, sentence, and paragraph must move in a logical progression, and convey a definite conventional import.|$|E
