However industrialization on the other hand has waste disposal issues, causing dust and environmental pollution. In this work, Aluminium Metal Matrix Composite is prepared by reinforcing 10 [*]wt% and 20 [*]wt% of wet <b>grinder</b> <b>stone</b> dust particles an industrial waste obtained during processing of quarry rocks which are available in nature. In the composite materials design wear is a very important criterion requiring consideration which ensures the materials reliability in applications where they come in contact with the environment and other surfaces. Dry sliding wear test was carried out using pin-on-disc apparatus on the prepared composites. The results reveal that increasing the reinforcement content from 10 [*]wt% to 20 [*]wt% increases the resistance to wear rate...|$|E

ResultsPeak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), physical fitness index (PFI) and maximum oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) of control subjects were significantly higher than stone grinding, mill and agricultural workers. Among the three groups exposed to 'dust and plant source particulate matter', the mean values of PEFR and VO 2 max of <b>stone</b> <b>grinders</b> were significantly lower than mill and agricultural workers.

40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} alternative {{relations between}} cumulative exposures to hand-transmitted vibration (taking account of vibration magnitude, lifetime exposure duration, {{and frequency of}} vibration) {{and the development of}} white finger (Raynaud’s phenomenon). Methods: Three previous studies have been combined to provide a group of 1557 users of powered vibratory tools in seven occupational subgroups: <b>stone</b> <b>grinders,</b> <b>stone</b> carvers, quarry drillers, dockyard caulkers, dockyard boilermakers, dockyard painters, and forest workers. The estimated total operating duration in hours was thus obtained for each subject, for each tool, and for all tools combined. From the vibration magnitudes and exposure durations, seven alternative measurements of cumulative exposure were calculated for each subject, using expressions of the form: dose = {sum}amiti, where ai is the acceleration magnitude on tool i, ti is the lifetime exposure duration for tool i, and m = 0, 1, 2, or 4. Results: For all seven alternative dose measures, an increase in dose was associated with {{a significant increase in the}} occurrence of vibration-induced white finger, after adjustment for age and smoking. However, dose measures with high powers of acceleration (m > 1) faired less well than measures in which the weighted or unweighted acceleration, and lifetime exposure duration, were given equal weight (m = 1). Dose determined solely by the lifetime exposure duration (without consideration of the vibration magnitude) gave better predictions than measures with m greater than unity. All measures of dose calculated from the unweighted acceleration gave better predictions than the equivalent dose measures using acceleration frequency-weighted according to current standards. Conclusions: Since the total duration of exposure does not discriminate between exposures accumulated over the day and those accumulated over years, a linear relation between vibration magnitude and exposure duration seems appropriate for predicting the occurrence of vibration-induced white finger. Poorer predictions were obtained when the currently recommended frequency weighting was employed than when accelerations at all frequencies were given equal weight. Findings suggest that improvements are possible to both the frequency weighting and the time dependency used to predict the development of vibration-induced white finger in current standards...|$|R

40|$|Ever {{since the}} sixteenth century, Antwerp {{had been an}} {{important}} centre for the trade in gemstones. The Scheldt-city counted {{a great number of}} goldsmiths, jewellers, and <b>grinders</b> of precious <b>stones,</b> whose products were greatly admired by contemporaries. This paper {{tells the story of the}} collections of those Antwerp artisans who were experts in the trade and processing of gemstones. Based on probate inventories, it deals with their personal collections, with the gems for sale in their shops (unworked, grinded, or mounted into new objects), but also how these objects in turn became part of other Antwerp collections. Gems had been part of collections ever since the earliest princely treasuries. As gems became part of collections, some were elevated from the domain of utility; they gained a new status as meaningful objects (so-called ‘semiophores’). Especially in the case of gems, there was a fluid transition between utilitarian objects and objects imbued with meaning. This paper further challenges the traditional dichotomy between utilitarian objects and semiophores, by arguing that in early seventeenth-century Antwerp, it was precisely the practical-material knowledge about gems, which made them beloved and meaningful collectables. Practical knowledge earlier restricted to the workshops of artisans, was now ‘collected’ by the knowledgeable in the from of objects that were considered to be transmitters of knowledge: the gems themselves, but also imitation gems, artefacts with gems, tools, recipe books, engravings, and paintings...|$|R
40|$|Background : Quartz <b>stone</b> <b>grinders</b> are {{one such}} group {{of workers who}} are exposed to silica and thereby at risk of {{developing}} silicosis. However due to increased campaigning against silicosis the scenario has changed. Objectives : To compare the respiratory morbidities among the present quartz stone workers and the ex-quartz stone workers who have left the job. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study included, 134 ex-workers and 182 current workers of quartz grinding units. All these subjects were subjected to chest radiography and pulmonary function tests. Results: For 134 ex-workers, the mean age was 31. 77 &# 177; 9. 99 years and the mean duration of exposure {{was found to be}} 2. 74 &# 177; 1. 65 years while for the present workers, the mean age was 26. 74 &# 177; 7. 12 years while the mean duration of exposure was 1. 36 &# 177; 2. 68 years. The study revealed silicosis in 24 (17. 9 &#x 0025;), radiological suspected tuberculosis in 17 (12. 7 &#x 0025;) and silico-tuberculosis in 33 (24. 7 &#x 0025;) ex-workers while in present workers, radiological suspected tuberculosis in 10 (5. 5 &#x 0025;) subjects and silicosis grade 1 / 1 in one subject were found. Among the ex-workers, 14 (10. 4 &#x 0025;) had a combined type of pulmonary function impairment while 8 (6. 0 &#x 0025;) and 28 (20. 9 &#x 0025;) were having restrictive and obstructive type of pulmonary impairments, respectively.

40|$|The Health Hazard Evaluation Program {{received}} {{a request from}} a gray and ductile iron foundry. The employer was seeking guidance on noise control solutions for the molding, knockoff, grinding, and inspection areas. We visited the facility in April 2011 to discuss concerns with managers and employees; observe work activities and processes; measure employees' noise exposures, sound levels, and noise frequencies; and assess potential noise control options. Noise sources included striking metal with sledgehammers; cutting metal with chop saws; and smoothing metal edges with stationary abrasive <b>stone</b> <b>grinders,</b> hand-held pneumatic chisels and grinders, and shotblast tumblers. The foundry operated three shifts per day and had about 200 employees. Employees worked 10 -hour shifts. Noise levels in many work areas were very high (above 100 decibels). Metal-to-metal contact, grinders and saws, compressed air, and vibration caused most noise from equipment and shaker conveyors. All employees we monitored were exposed to noise above noise exposure limits, and some employees' noise exposures were above 100 decibels, A-weighted. Some employees did not insert their foam earplugs properly. We recommended the foundry install controls to reduce noise, implement a long-term plan to purchase new equipment that generates less noise, require employees working in areas where noise exposures are above 100 decibels, A-weighted to wear earplugs and earmuffs, and use National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommendations for evaluating employees' hearing tests. We recommended employees wear hearing protection properly and tell their doctor that they work in areas with high noise levels and about hearing problems they have.
