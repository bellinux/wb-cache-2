5|$|Explicit {{goals of}} <b>financial</b> {{regulation}} include countries' pursuits of <b>financial</b> stability and the safeguarding of unsophisticated market players from fraudulent activity, while implicit goals include offering viable and competitive <b>financial</b> environments to world investors. A single nation with functioning governance, <b>financial</b> regulations, deposit insurance, emergency financing through discount windows, standard accounting practices, and established legal and disclosure procedures, can itself develop and grow a healthy domestic <b>financial</b> system. In a global context however, no central political authority exists which can extend these arrangements globally. Rather, governments have cooperated {{to establish a}} host of institutions and practices that have evolved over time and are referred to collectively as the international <b>financial</b> architecture. Within this architecture, regulatory authorities such as national governments and intergovernmental organizations {{have the capacity to}} influence international <b>financial</b> markets. National governments may employ their finance ministries, treasuries, and regulatory agencies to impose tariffs and foreign capital controls or may use their central banks to execute a desired intervention in the open markets.|$|E

5|$|Some {{degree of}} {{self-regulation}} occurs whereby {{banks and other}} <b>financial</b> institutions attempt to operate within guidelines set and published by multilateral {{organizations such as the}} International Monetary Fund or the Bank for International Settlements (particularly the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Committee on the Global <b>Financial</b> System). Further examples of international regulatory bodies are: the <b>Financial</b> Stability Board (FSB) established to coordinate information and activities among developed countries; the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) which coordinates the regulation of <b>financial</b> securities; the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) which promotes consistent insurance industry supervision; the <b>Financial</b> Action Task Force on Money Laundering which facilitates collaboration in battling money laundering and terrorism financing; and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) which publishes accounting and auditing standards. Public and private arrangements exist to assist and guide countries struggling with sovereign debt payments, such as the Paris Club and London Club. National securities commissions and independent <b>financial</b> regulators maintain oversight of their industries' foreign exchange market activities. Two examples of supranational <b>financial</b> regulators in Europe are the European Banking Authority (EBA) which identifies systemic risks and institutional weaknesses and may overrule national regulators, and the European Shadow <b>Financial</b> Regulatory Committee (ESFRC) which reviews <b>financial</b> regulatory issues and publishes policy recommendations.|$|E

An array of smaller <b>financial</b> centers became important as they found market niches, such as Amsterdam, Brussels, Zurich, and Geneva.
