40|$|Paragraph 7 (1) of the VAT Act {{provides}} for the charging of VAT at 14 percent on the supply of goods or services by a vendor in the course or furtherance of an ‘enterprise’, the importation into South Africa of goods by any person or the supply of ‘imported services’. The term ‘enterprise’ has been interpreted to require an on-going activity and therefore once off sales should be excluded. The sale must relate to enterprise activities, thereby excluding private sales. Furthermore the enterprise activities are required {{to be carried out}} in the Republic or partly in the Republic. Establishing whether the enterprise activities are carried out in the Republic remains a contentious issue as the VAT Act does not specify the minimum required business activities to meet this criterion. ‘Imported services’ excludes services imported for the purposes of making taxable supplies and the liability of accounting for VAT on ‘imported services’ lies with the recipient of the imported service. Supplies (imported services) which are chargeable in terms of s 7 (1) (a) and supplies, which if made in the Republic, are exempt from VAT or zero rated. ‘Imported services’ definition requires services to be consumed in South Africa. Services offered outside South Africa therefore generally do not qualify as imported services even the South African entity benefits from such services, for example a training course attended in a foreign country. Technological developments in the field of e-commerce globally have required countries to examine VAT laws relating to e-commerce. Extensive research has been done by the OECD on this topic, with reports issued on recommendations of how e-commerce should be taxed. Most guidance issued by the OECD on taxing e-commerce relates to <b>indirect</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce,</b> which refers to goods or services where ordering, payment and delivery occur on line. Distinction is drawn between taxation of business-to-business transactions and business-to-consumer transactions. The OECD suggests that the ‘reverse-charge’ or self-assessment method should be applied to the taxing of B 2 B transactions resulting in minimal compliance and administrative costs. It is further recommended that for B 2 C transactions place of consumption should be defined as the recipient’s usual jurisdiction of residence and that non-resident suppliers should be required to register and pay VAT in the jurisdiction of the consumer, as this would result in the most effective tax collection method. ‘Enterprise’ includes electronic services from a foreign supplier where the recipient is a resident of South Africa or where the payment originated from a South African bank account. The Minister’s regulation, which came into effect on 1 June 2014, includes the following items in the definition of electronic services: educational services, games, online auction services, miscellaneous services and subscription services. The South African VAT legislation draws no distinction between B 2 B and B 2 C supplies of electronic services. The reasoning behind this was to avoid situations in which private customers could pose as business customers {{in order to avoid the}} levying of tax. A review of the services currently included in the Minister’s regulation on electronic services indicate that services that would relate to B 2 B supplies have mostly been excluded from the regulation. Effectively the South African VAT legislation manages to indirectly exclude B 2 B supplies from the definition of electronic services and therefore achieves the objective of minimising the administrative burden on B 2 B supplie...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the {{issues related to}} the implementation of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of services. To illustrate the main features of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of services, we have selected legal and administrative services. We describe in the paper the actors who take part in these services, the system architecture and the workflow that defines the interactions and interchange of information among actors. With these elements we have implemented an <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> application inside the TRADE project 2 that demonstrates how these services can be offered in an electronic manner. 1 <b>Electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of legal and administrative services This section attempts to describe in a general way the characteristics of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of services. In particular, we have selected legal and administrative services to show the advantages of providing services through electronic means. 1. 1 <b>Electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of services vs. <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of products When we talk about <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce,</b> we are usually thinking about <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of products, but there is also another kind of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce,</b> the <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of services. Whilst <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of products consists on selecting the items we want to buy from a catalog and pay for them, <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of services consists on searching for a professional or company that offers the service and contract him. During service development, there can be information request, payment or contacts with another users. 1. 2 Characteristics of legal and administrative services We have studied in detail the legal and administrative services in order to describe them. These are their main features: • There is a purchase of services. The result of these services (normally documents) is delivered after off-line development. • Many official documents must be interchanged. 1 Working in her Ph.

Much of the existing literature in <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> puts forward theoretical models and speculative argumentation in an attempt to describe and understand the <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> phenomenon. In contradistinction to this type of approach, this paper reports on an empirical investigation of the perspectives of senior executives (CEOs and/or owners) as to their actual experiences of and beliefs about the impacts of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> in the retail car industry in Western Australia. These viewpoints and perspectives were elicited during face-to-face, semistructured interviews lasting between 1. 5 and 3 hours. Generally speaking, the executives interviewed are experiencing great uncertainty with respect to <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> and its effect on their business: they are uncertain about its likely impacts long term (although not much is currently happening), they are uncertain about the ultimate magnitude of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> in their industry, they are uncertain about {{the costs and benefits of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> investments, but they are unwilling not to be involved at all.

40|$|The {{teaching}} of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> in universities {{has become a}} growth industry in itself.

The association of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> as primarily a technical or information technology (IT) phenomenon has not been sufficient to constrain it to IT and information systems departments.

This paper draws on the work of Kenneth Boulding who argued that the dynamics of change in society are largely a product of changing skills and the way these skills are arranged into roles at the organizational level. It is argued that an overly technical interpretation of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> narrows the skills being acquired as part of formal education. Universities, under pressure from the market and technological change, are changing their roles resulting in a further narrowing of the breadth of issues that is seen as legitimate to be included as <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce.</b> The outcome is that aspiring <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> professionals are not being exposed to a wide enough agenda of ideas and concepts that will assist them to make better business decisions. <b>Electronic</b> <b>Commerce,</b> Management Education, Skills, Training, Universities,...|$|R

40|$|Much of {{the rhetoric}} about Web-based <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> focuses on its use in {{reaching}} global markets. Yet not all businesses can or should target global audiences. The literature on <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> to date does not provide adequate guidance about the ways that local merchants can exploit synergies between their local physical presence and <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> on the Web. In this paper, potential synergies, such as using a combined physical and virtual presence to improve trust, help consumers manage risk, meet diverse shopping preferences, and taking advantage of natural physical-virtual complementarities, are developed. We follow with a brief empirical analysis that illustrates the relative lack of use of these synergies among small and medium sized enterprises having a physical presence in a local market.

To understand the factors for the successful implementation of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> applications in the long term insurance environment the current internet usage and needs of the market is investigated. It is found that internet usage is growing phenomenally. <b>Electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> is thus a viable business-to-consumer option for insurers and can provide an insurer with a significant competitive advantage. The study shows that the current legislative environment allows for the increased use of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> by accepting <b>electronic</b> data as sufficient for evidentiary purposes in courts of law and allowing electronic contracting.
