25|$|During {{his career}} in Etawah, he built a {{personal}} collection of bird specimens, however it was destroyed during the 1857 rebellion. Subsequently, he started afresh with a systematic plan to survey and document the birds of the Indian Subcontinent {{and in the process}} he accumulated the largest collection of Asiatic birds in the world, which he housed in a museum and library at his home in Rothney Castle on Jakko Hill, Simla. Rothney Castle, originally Rothney House was built by Colonel Octavius Edward Rothney and later belonged to P. Mitchell, C.I.E from whom Hume bought it and converted it into a palatial house with some hope that it might be bought by the Government as a Viceregal residence since the Governor-General then occupied Peterhoff, a building too small for large parties. Hume spent over two hundred thousand pounds on the grounds and buildings. He added enormous reception rooms suitable for large dinner parties and balls, as well as a magnificent conservatory and spacious hall with walls displaying his superb collection of Indian horns. He used a large room for his bird museum. He hired a European gardener, and made the grounds and conservatory a perpetual <b>horticultural</b> <b>exhibition,</b> to which he courteously admitted all visitors. Rothney Castle could only be reached by a steep road, and was never purchased by the British Government.|$|E

My guards, or adorers, {{or whatever the}} young men who looked after me really were, led me forward, and made signs to me that I was to bring up the rear of the procession--behind the bears, which made no attempt (as {{in the case of the}} prophet) to take the part of a Minister of the Bungletonian Connection. What a position for one who would fain have been opening the eyes of this darkened people to better things! But, till I had acquired some knowledge of their language, I felt my only chance was to acquiesce in everything not positively sinful. The entrance of a menagerie and <b>horticultural</b> <b>exhibition</b> into the town--for thus I explained to myself what was going on before my eyes--could not be severely censured by the harshest critic, and I prepared to show my affability by joining in an innocent diversion and popular entertainment.|$|E
