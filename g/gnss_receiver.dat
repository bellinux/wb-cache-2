50|$|In a {{software}} <b>GNSS</b> <b>receiver,</b> all digital processing is {{performed by a}} general purpose microprocessor.

30|$|In this article, {{we propose}} a low-complexity {{solution}} for the decimation chain in the digital front-end (DFE) of global navigation satellite system (<b>GNSS)</b> <b>receivers.</b> The received signals are typically highly oversampled in the DFE of <b>GNSS</b> <b>receivers</b> to reduce the ranging error and therefore to improve the positioning accuracy in the tracking stage of the <b>GNSS</b> <b>receivers.</b> However, this oversampling imposes unnecessary complexity on the acquisition stage of the <b>GNSS</b> <b>receivers</b> where an approximate estimate of the code phase and Doppler frequency shift is produced. Therefore, reducing the sampling frequency for the acquisition stage reduces the overall receiver complexity without any {{significant effect on the}} performance of such receivers. The proposed {{solution for the}} decimation chain involves the use of infinite impulse response (IIR) filters as the decimation filter as they can be implemented more efficiently in comparison to finite impulse response (FIR). In addition, a hybrid time-frequency domain filtering scheme is proposed here to alleviate the effects of non-linear phase in the decimation IIR filter as well as the analog front-end receivers. The advantages of this proposed method is explored and stated, both from performance and complexity perspectives, through rigorous comparison with alternative available solutions.|$|R
40|$|Interference {{detection}} is {{very important}} for Global Navigation Satellite System (<b>GNSS)</b> <b>receivers.</b> Current work on interference detection in <b>GNSS</b> <b>receivers</b> has mainly focused on time-frequency (TF) analysis techniques, such as spectrogram and Wigner–Ville distribution (WVD), where the spectrogram approach presents the TF resolution trade-off problem, since the analysis window is used, and the WVD method suffers from the very serious cross-term problem, due to its quadratic TF distribution nature. In order to solve the cross-term problem and to preserve good TF resolution in the TF plane at the same time, in this paper, a new TF distribution by using a reassigned spectrogram has been proposed in interference detection for <b>GNSS</b> <b>receivers.</b> This proposed reassigned spectrogram method efficiently combines the elimination of the cross-term provided by the spectrogram itself according to its inherent nature and the improvement of the TF aggregation property achieved by the reassignment method. Moreover, a notch filter has been adopted in interference mitigation for <b>GNSS</b> <b>receivers,</b> where receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) are used as metrics for the characterization of interference mitigation performance. The proposed interference detection method by using a reassigned spectrogram is evaluated by experiments on GPS L 1 signals in the disturbing scenarios in comparison to the state-of-the-art TF analysis approaches. The analysis results show that the proposed interference detection technique effectively overcomes the cross-term problem and also keeps good TF localization properties, which has been proven to be valid and effective to enhance the interference Sensors 2015, 15 22168 detection performance; in addition, the adoption of the notch filter in interference mitigation has shown a significant acquisition performance improvement in terms of ROC curves for <b>GNSS</b> <b>receivers</b> in jamming environments...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{using the}} {{services}} provided by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is ubiquitous in geodesy, cadastre and Geographic Information Systems. Galileo, the GNSS system which is under development by the European Union, will transmit navigation signals in four subbands (E 5 a/L 5, E 5 b, E 6 and E 1 /L 1) within the L band. GNSS systems {{are not the only}} users of the L band around the world; other telecommunication systems also use it. Papers analyzing real RF measurement campaigns have shown that loss-of-lock on the navigational signals is possible to <b>GNSS</b> <b>receivers</b> in the vicinity of radio and TV broadcast transmitters. It has also been demonstrated that, in the nearby area of airports, radionavigation or communication systems (e. g. Very High Frequency Omindirectional Radio Range or Instrument Landing System) can cause interference to <b>GNSS</b> <b>receivers.</b> These interferences are unwanted because they can affect the precision of the <b>GNSS</b> <b>receivers</b> and can compromise the topographical measurements. Therefore it is essential to understand better the negative effects of RF interferences on <b>GNSS</b> <b>receivers</b> and to optimize the solutions against the interferences. This paper deals with the particular matter of filtering the narrowband interferences affecting Multiplexed-Binary-Offset-Carrier (MBOC) Galileo navigation signal...|$|R
