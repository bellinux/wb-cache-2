40|$|Suppose {{there is}} a failure of a bank: Would balance sheet {{connections}} among banks arising from <b>interbank</b> <b>commitments</b> propagate a crisis? Would a bank’s position in the interbank market affect its level of depositor runs? What role would the interbank market play during a crisis? How would the release of public information affect the financial crisis? Though these questions {{are at the heart}} of many debates, answering them has proven difficult because of lack of data on interbank exposures. We use a unique dataset from India that allows us to identify the <b>interbank</b> <b>commitments</b> in order to test contagion in the banking system of an idiosyncratic shock [...] caused due to a fraud in one of the banks. Interestingly, we find that the level of exposure with the failed bank is an important determinant of depositor runs. What makes this result even more intriguing is the fact that information on the exposure with the failed bank was not available to the depositors. We find that despite other controls, exposure level with the failed bank retains its explanatory power. We also find that release of information by media has a destabilizing effect on banks’ deposits. Furthermore, we find that banks that have lower level of exposure with the failed bank voluntarily release information on their exposure level. Finally, we find that outstanding interbank claims among other banks intensify the negative impact of the initia...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a monetary {{model in which}} interbank markets bear limited commitment to contracts. Limited commitment reduces the proportion of assets {{that can be used}} as collateral, and thus banks with high liquidity demands face borrowing constraints in interbank markets. These constraints can be relieved by the central bank (a lender of last resort) through the provision of liquidity loans. I show that the constrained-efficient allocation can be decentralized by controlling only the money growth rate if <b>commitment</b> to <b>interbank</b> contracts is not limited. Otherwise, a proper combination of central bank loans and monetary policy is needed to bring the market equilibrium into a state of constrained efficiency. Overlapping generations, money, <b>interbank</b> markets, limited <b>commitment,</b> the lender of last resort...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 1 {{builds a}} two-bank {{bargaining}} {{model of the}} overnight interbank market in which, due to {{the commitment of the}} central bank to its interest rate target, bargaining between banks impacts loan sizes rather than interest rates (the converse of existing models). As a result, policy changes have a different impact to what is posited by existing models. The model is applied to a market where the commitment of the central bank is well documented (Australia). With reasonable parameter values, the model replicates five stylised facts of the Australian market. Moreover, the stylised facts are replicated without recourse to any asymmetries. Chapter 2 extends the two-bank model to incorporate a large number of heterogeneous banks. This model is able to replicate the asymmetric shape of banks' end-of-day central bank deposit distributions (despite symmetric initial distributions); a novel contribution to the literature. Moreover, after inputting recent changes in Australian central bank policy, this model produces percentage changes in interbank trading volumes that closely align with the data. Central banks typically supply more overnight deposits than banks desire to hold (in aggregate), but this aggregate is typically small relative to <b>interbank</b> lending. With <b>commitment,</b> this is not required for the central bank to achieve its interest rate target (the typical explanation in the literature). So, to explain this phenomenon, Chapter 3 builds a DSGE model that incorporates commitment and the results from the previous chapters. Due to asymmetric information, there may be stigma associated with borrowing from the central bank's overnight lending facility, which is costly. But while the central bank can reduce use of its lending facility, by increasing aggregate deposits, the resulting fall in interbank lending is also costly; because the interbank market helps banks monitor their counterparties. Therefore, low but positive aggregate deposits can be explained as the welfare-optimising point in the trade-off between stigma and monitoring costs (a novel contribution to the literature). </p...|$|R
