50|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the 19th century anchors were of <b>imperfect</b> <b>manufacture,</b> the means of effecting good and efficient welding being absent and the iron poor, whilst the arms, being straight, generally parted at the crown, when weighing from good holding-ground. A clerk in Plymouth Yard, named Pering, {{in the early part of}} that century (1813) introduced curved arms; and after 1852 the British admiralty anchor, under the direction of the Board, was supplied to H.M. ships, followed by Lieutenant (afterwards Captain) Rodger's anchor. Rodger's anchor marked a great departure from the form of previous anchors. The arms were formed in one piece, and were pivoted at the crown on a bolt passing through the forked shank. The points or pees to the palms were blunt. This anchor had an excellent reputation amongst nautical men of that period, and by the committee on anchors, appointed by the British admiralty in 1852, it was placed second only to the anchor of Trotman.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Polyacrylate {{dielectric}} elastomers {{have yielded}} extremely large strain and elastic energy density {{suggesting that they}} are useful for many actuator applications. A thorough understanding of the physics underlying the mechanism of the observed response to an electric field can help develop improved actuators. The response {{is believed to be}} due to Maxwell stress, a quadratic dependence of the stress upon applied electric field. Based on this supposition, an equation relating the applied voltage to the measured force from an actuator was derived. Experimental data fit with the expected behavior, though there are discrepancies. Further analysis suggests that these arise mostly from <b>imperfect</b> <b>manufacture</b> of the actuators, though there is a small contribution from an explicitly electrostrictive behavior of the acrylic adhesive. Measurements of the dielectric constant of stretched polymer reveal that the dielectric constant drops, when the polymer is strained, indicating the existence of a small electrostrictive effect. Finally, measurements of the electric breakdown field were made. These also show a dependence upon the strain. In the unstrained state the breakdown field is 20 MV/m, which grows to 218 MV/m at 500 500 % strain. This large increase could prove to be of importance in actuator design...|$|E
40|$|In this project, {{two kinds}} of {{induction}} motor faults, stator short circuit fault and broken rotor bar fault, are investigated by using motor current signature analysis (MCSA) and zero crossing time (ZCT) method. These methods {{are based on the}} detection of sidebands around the supply frequency in the stator current signal. The thesis starts by a review of these two common faults and two commonly used diagnostic methods. Before the motor stator short circuit faults experiments, baseline analysis is carried out on two same types of healthy motors. Meanwhile, signal processing programs, composed in MATLAB and LABVIEW, are verified to ensure the accurate diagnosis of motor faults. Through a control box, artificial turn to turn fault and phase to phase fault are structured in each test. MCSA and ZCT are utilized to extract broken rotor bar information from recorded stator current signal. Although an induction motor is highly symmetrical, it may still have a detectable signal component at the fault frequencies due to <b>imperfect</b> <b>manufacture,</b> improper motor installation and so on. The misalignment experiments reveal that improper motor installation could lead to an unexpected frequency peak, which will affect motor fault diagnosis. Furthermore, manufacture tolerance and working environment could also result in disturbing the motor fault diagnosis. Through both online and offline experiments, MCSA and ZCT methods could detect particular abnormal harmonics related to stator short circuit fault and broken rotor bar fault. Compared with the conventional MCSA method, the ZCT method has the advantage of reduced computational burden. Thesis (M. Eng. Sc.)

40|$|Bypass flow in a {{prismatic}} {{high temperature}} gas reactor (HTGR) occurs between graphite blocks as they sit {{side by side}} in the core. Bypass flow is not intentionally designed to occur in the reactor, but is present because of tolerances in <b>manufacture,</b> <b>imperfect</b> installation and expansion and shrinkage of the blocks from heating and irradiation. It is desired to increase the knowledge of the effects of such flow, which has been estimated to be as much as 20 % of the total helium coolant flow. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations can provide estimates of the scale and impacts of bypass flow. Previous CFD calculations have examined the effects of bypass gap width, level and distribution of heat generation and effects of shrinkage. The present contribution examines the effects of graphite surface roughness on the bypass flow for different relative roughness factors on three gap widths. Such calculations should be validated using specific bypass flow measurements. While such experiments are currently underway for the specific reference prismatic HTGR design for the next generation nuclear plant (NGNP) program of the U. S. Dept. of Energy, the data are not yet available. To enhance confidence in the present calculations, wall shear stress and heat transfer results for several turbulence models and their associated wall treatments are first compared for flow in a single tube that is representative of a coolant channel in the prismatic HTGR core. The results are compared to published correlations for wall shear stress and Nusselt number in turbulent pipe flow. Turbulence models that perform well are then used to make bypass flow calculations in a symmetric onetwelfth sector of a prismatic block that includes bypass flow. The comparison of shear stress and Nusselt number results with published correlations constitutes a partial validation of the CFD model. Calculations are also compared to ones made previously using a different CFD code. Results indicate that increasing surface roughness increases the maximum fuel and helium temperatures as do increases in gap width. However, maximum coolant temperature variation due to increased gap width is not changed by surface roughness...|$|R
