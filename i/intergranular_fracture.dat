50|$|A transgranular {{fracture}} is {{a fracture}} {{that follows the}} edges of lattices in a granular material, ignoring the grains in the individual lattices. This results in a fairly smooth looking fracture with less sharp edges than one that follows the changing grains. This can be visualized as several wooden jigsaw puzzle pieces with the grains showing, but with each piece having grains running in a different direction. A transgranular fracture follows the grains in the wood, not {{the edges of the}} puzzle pieces. This is opposed to an <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracture.</b>|$|E
50|$|In certain {{materials}} and under certain conditions, {{the boundaries between}} the grains are the weakest regions in the material. An <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracture</b> is a fracture that grows along the grain boundaries of the material. In a wall of bricks it would correspond to a fracture {{that takes place in}} the mortar that keeps the bricks together. In metals with multiple lattice organizations, when one lattice ends and another begins, the fracture changes direction to follow the new grain. This results in a fairly jagged looking fracture with straight edges of the grain and shiny surface may be seen.|$|E

50|$|Crack {{initiation}} and propagation accompany fracture. The manner {{by which}} the crack propagates through the material gives great insight into the mode of fracture. In ductile materials (ductile fracture), the crack moves slowly and {{is accompanied by a}} large amount of plastic deformation around the crack tip. The crack will usually not extend unless an increased stress is applied. On the other hand, in dealing with brittle fracture, cracks spread very rapidly with little or no plastic deformation. The cracks that propagate in a brittle material will continue to grow and increase in magnitude once they are initiated. In a part made of a ductile material, the crack may progress to a section of the part where stresses a slighly lower and stop due to the blunting effect of plastic deformations at the crack tip. Another important mannerism of crack propagation {{is the way in which}} the advancing crack travels through the material. A crack that passes through the grains within the material is undergoing transgranular fracture. However, a crack that propagates along the grain boundaries is termed an <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracture.</b>|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} in this laboratory led {{to the conclusion that}} the low temperature <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracture</b> mode in Fe-Mn alloys is microstructurally determined, and does not require metalloid segregation or other chemical contamination. That conclusion was tested in the present investigation, which used high resolution scanning Auger microscopy to study the <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracture</b> surfaces. The fracture mode at liquid nitrogen temperature was found to be <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracture</b> whenever the alloy was quenched from the austenite field, irrespective of the austenization time or temperature. High resolution chemical analyses of the <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracture</b> surfaces failed to reveal any consistent segregation of P, S, 0, or N. The occasional appearance of sulfur or oxygen on the fracture surface was found to be due to a low density precipitation of MnS and MnO{sub 2 } along the prior austenite grain boundaries. Excepting these dispersed precipitates, there was no evidence of manganese enrichment of the prior austenite grain boundaries. A slight segregation of carbon was found along the grain boundaries, but does not appear to be implicated in the tendency toward <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracture.</b> The present results hence reinforce the conclusion that the low temperature <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracture</b> of Fe- 12 Mn is microstructurally determined...|$|E

With this experience in mind, various hypotheses for brittle <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracture</b> in Al–Li alloys are reviewed, and possible remedial measures outlined. The effects of variables such as alloy composition, ageing times and temperatures, crystallographic texture, and test temperature on brittle-intergranular-fracture resistance are described, and it is concluded that lithium segregation to grain boundaries is primarily responsible for brittle <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracture.</b> Lithium segregation occurs mainly during the primary ageing treatment; but secondary ageing during service, where temperatures can reach 50 – 80 °C, could increase lithium segregation and further increase susceptibility to brittle <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracture.</b> The evidence also suggests that the prevalence of a planar-slip-mode in Al–Li alloys, resulting in dislocation pile-ups at grain boundaries, is not responsible for brittle <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracture,</b> contrary to widespread opinion...|$|E

The results show that the friction coefficient is considerably higher for the diesel fuel than for biodiesels in the stationary regime (about 0. 14 and 0. 06, respectively). The wear coefficient values are in the range 10 − 8 – 10 − 9 mm 3 /N·m, denoting a mild wear regime, in agreement with the high lubricity of these fuels assessed by the ASTM D 6079 standard.

A maximum reduction of the static K of 46 % was obtained for the highest amplitude dynamic cyclic loading test. A second series of cyclic tests showed that the 45 °and 70 °inclined chevron notch cracks opened {{from the beginning of the}} cyclic loading test, whereas under monotonic loading, the chevron notch cracks closed up to failure. When compared with static rupture, the detailed scanning electron microscope (SEM) examinations showed that fatigue damage in Brisbane tuff is strongly influenced by the failure of the matrix, due to both <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracturing</b> and transgranular fracturing, whereas smooth and bright cracks were formed along cleavage planes under static loading...|$|R

Plastic {{deformation of}} TiN films was caused by the indentation of the trigonal diamond tip, and evidence of this phenomenon was provided by cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation and transmission electron diffraction (TED) analysis. The influence of the differences in residual stress and grain size on hardness anisotropy was restrictive, and hardness anisotropy {{can be explained by the}} anisotropy of yield stress as calculated using Schmid's law.

However, the ability of a given concentration of an embrittling species to cause fracture can be modified by many factors.

40|$|Austenitic {{stainless}} steels are normally ductile and exhibit deep dimples on fracture surfaces. These steels can, however, exhibit brittle <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracture</b> under some circumstances. The occurrence of <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracture</b> in the irradiated steels is briefly reviewed based on limited literature data. The data are sorted {{according to the}} irradiation temperature. <b>Intergranular</b> <b>fracture</b> may occur in association with a high irradiation temperature and void swelling. At low irradiation temperature, the steels can exhibit <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracture</b> at low or even at room temperatures during loading in air and in high temperature water (~ 300 °C). This paper deals with {{the similarities and differences}} for IG fractures and discusses the mechanisms involved. The <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracture</b> occurrence at low temperatures might be correlated with decohesion or twinning and strain martensite transformation in local narrow areas around grain boundaries. The possibility of a ductile-to-brittle transition is also discussed. In case of void swelling higher than 3 %, quasi-cleavage at low temperature might be expected as a consequence of ductile-to-brittle fracture changes with temperature. Any existence of the change in fracture behavior in the steels of present thermal reactor internals with increasing irradiation dose should be clearly proven or disproven.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of fracture in polycrystalline alumina were investigated at the grain level using both the micromechanical tests and finite element (FE) model. First, the bending experiments {{were performed on}} the alumina microcantilever beams with a controlled displacement rate of 10 nm s– 1 at the free end; {{it was observed that}} the <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracture</b> dominates the failure process. The full scale 3 D Voronoi cell FE model of the microcantilever bending tests was then developed and experimentally validated to provide the insight into the cracking mechanisms in the <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracture.</b> It was found that the crystalline morphology and orientation of grains {{have a significant impact on}} the localised stress in polycrystalline alumina. The interaction of adjacent grains as well as their different orientations determines the localised tensile and shear stress state in grain boundaries. In the <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracture</b> process, the crack formation and propagation are predominantly governed by tensile opening (mode I) and shear sliding (mode II) along grain boundaries.

40|$|Patterns of {{deformation}} {{within the}} Upheaval Dome structure, Utah, provide important clues for assessing its possible impact origin. The complex {{structure of the}} innermost part of the dome, in particular of the White Rim Sandstone (WRS), indicated almost complete loss of internal coherence during deformation. The WRS displays extreme thickness variations, blind terminations and frequent embranchments at nodular-like points. This, together with discordant contacts to the country rock, shows that WRS builds up a dike network that was emplaced and injected during formation of the central dome. Microstructural analysis reveals that the macroscopically ductile appearance is achieved by distributed cataclastic flow. Beside <b>intergranular</b> <b>fracturing,</b> dislocation pile-ups, dislocation arrays and tangles indicate additional dislocation glide activity in quartz of WRS during deformation. Disseminated brittle fault zone networks postdate the cataclastic flow and represent the final deformation increments during formation of the central uplift. The distributed cataclastic flow in the sandstones was initiated by grain crushing, collapse of pore space, and subsequent intergranular shear. In accordance with experimental data for a similar sandstone (Berea sandstone), {{it is suggested that}} a high effective confining pressure, most likely in excess of 250 MPa, was necessary to cause this flow. At shallow crustal levels (maximum possible depth of burial of WRS is 3 km) such a high confining pressure can only be build up dynamically by impact processes. From deformation mechanisms, a shock wave attenuation to magnitudes below the Hugoniot elastic limit of quartz can be deduced and correlates with a burial of the studied sediments of 2 - 3 km {{at the time of the}} impact...|$|R

Craters in water-saturated porous targets are generally shallower and larger in volume and in diameter than craters from equivalent impacts into dry porous sandstone. Morphometric analyses of the resultant craters, 540 cm in diameter, reveal features that are characteristic of all of our experimental craters regardless of impact conditions (I) a large central depression within a fragile, light-colored central part, and (II) an outer spallation zone with areas of incipient spallation.

Zone (I) approximates the shape of the transient crater formed by material compression, displacement, comminution, and excavation flow, whereas (II) is the result of <b>intergranular</b> tensile <b>fracturing</b> and spallation. The transient crater dimensions are reconstructed by fitting quadric parabolas to crater profiles from digital elevation models. The dimensions of this transient and of the final crater show the same trends: both increase in volume with increasing impact energy, and with increasing water saturation of the target pore space.

Numerical experiments have been carried out to simulate these microfractures in granular media using a boundary-element computer code DIGS. Grains were represented by straight-sided polygons generated with a Voronoi generator. Experiments were carried out to simulate experimental microfracture studies of quartzite in triaxial extension tests. The results support the experimental observations that the microcracks induced by compressive stress are extensile and sub-parallel to the direction of maximum compressive stress. Various mechanisms of microcrack initiation were identified. Some cracks were found to be generated from inside the grains {{in a manner similar to}} a Brazilian test. Sliding cracks were found to start from grain boundaries as intergranular c acks and propagate as intragranular wing cracks in the direction of maximum compression. Pores were also modelled as a possible mechanism for microcrack initiation but were found to generate fractures in unexpected directions relative to the direction of applied loading. 1.
