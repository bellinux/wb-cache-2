5|$|Caprellamutica {{were first}} {{described}} in 1935 by A. Schurin from specimens {{collected from the}} Peter the Great Gulf in the Sea of Japan. It belongs to the genus Caprella in the subfamily Caprellinae of the family Caprellidae, a group of <b>highly</b> <b>specialized</b> amphipods commonly known as skeleton shrimp. Caprellids are classified under the superfamily Caprelloidea of the infraorder Caprellida.|$|E
5|$|It {{is evident}} that the mandibles were <b>highly</b> <b>specialized.</b> Like other Cretaceous ants, Zigrasimecia {{provides}} further evidence that the extinct ant fauna exhibited a great diversity of feeding behavior. The unusual mouthparts of Zigrasimecia are consistent with other extinct species found in Burmese, French, New Jersey and Canadian deposits, which also show morphologies not seen in extant ants.|$|E
5|$|Living strepsirrhines are {{predominantly}} arboreal, {{with only the}} ring-tailed lemur spending considerable time on the ground. Most species move around quadrupedally (on four legs) in the trees, including five genera of smaller, nocturnal lemurs. Galagos, indriids, sportive lemurs, and bamboo lemurs leap from vertical surfaces, and the indriids are <b>highly</b> <b>specialized</b> for vertical clinging and leaping. Lorises are slow-moving, deliberate climbers.|$|E

5|$|Bats are {{the second}} largest order of mammals (after the rodents), {{representing}} about 20% of all classified mammal species worldwide, with about 1,240 bat species divided into two suborders: the less specialized and largely fruit-eating megabats, including flying foxes, and the <b>highly</b> <b>specialized</b> and echolocating microbats. About 70% of bat species are insectivores. Most of the rest are frugivores, or fruit eaters. A few species feed from animals other than insects, with the vampire bats being hematophagous, or feeding on blood.|$|E
5|$|Beetles {{are able}} to exploit a wide {{diversity}} of food sources available in their many habitats. Some are omnivores, eating both plants and animals. Other beetles are <b>highly</b> <b>specialized</b> in their diet. Many species of leaf beetles, longhorn beetles, and weevils are very host-specific, feeding on only a single species of plant. Ground beetles and rove beetles (Staphylinidae), among others, are primarily carnivorous and catch and consume many other arthropods and small prey, such as earthworms and snails. While most predatory beetles are generalists, a few species have more specific prey requirements or preferences.|$|E

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that some neurons in extrastriate area MT {{are capable of}} signaling the global motion of complex patterns; neurons randomly sampled from V 1, on the other hand, respond only to the motion of individual oriented components. Because {{only a small fraction}} of V 1 neurons projects to MT, we wished to establish the processing hierarchy more precisely by studying the properties of those neurons projecting to MT, identified by antidromic responses to electrical stimulation of MT. The neurons that project from V 1 to MT were directionally selective and, like other V 1 neurons, responded only to the motion of the components of complex patterns. The projection neurons were predominantly “special complex, ” responsive to a broad range of spatial and temporal frequencies, and sensitive to very low stimulus contrasts.

5|$|Many {{authors have}} speculated that {{at the core of}} this {{symbolic}} explosion, and in tandem, was the development of syntactic language that evolved through a <b>highly</b> <b>specialized</b> social learning system providing the means for semantically unbounded discourse.

40|$|In {{order to}} succeed in today’s global, {{competitive}} market, manufacturing industries need continuous improvements in their multi-disciplinary design processes. These improvements should result in expending fewer resources on the design process while achieving better quality and more environmentally friendly products. The current approach for improving design processes is mostly based on intuitive observations followed by incre-mental changes to the existing methodologies. However, today’s fast-paced world needs rapid incorporation of new technologies and methods into design methodologies. Recent advances {{in the application of}} Artificial Intelligence to design-Multi-agent Design Systems in particular-provide an opportunity to accomplish this goal. The inter-disciplinary collab-oration between Computer Science and Engineering Design provides the means to develop systematic and holistic approaches for constructing superior design methodologies. An innovative approach has been developed that is based on simulating the design process using a multi-agent system that mimics the behavior of the design team.

5|$|Areoles are <b>highly</b> <b>specialized</b> {{and very}} {{condensed}} shoots or branches. In a normal shoot, nodes bearing leaves or flowers would be separated by lengths of stem (internodes). In an areole, the nodes {{are so close}} together, they form a single structure. The areole may be circular, elongated into an oval shape, or even separated into two parts; the two parts may be visibly connected in some way (e.g. by a groove in the stem) or appear entirely separate (a dimorphic areole). The part nearer {{the top of the}} stem then produces flowers, the other part spines. Areoles often have multicellular hairs (trichomes) that give the areole a hairy or woolly appearance, sometimes of a distinct color such as yellow or brown.|$|E
5|$|Due to the <b>highly</b> <b>specialized</b> mandibles, {{scientists}} believe that the ants exhibited habits no longer seen in extant ants. The highly movable head suggests that mobility was an important factor for them (probably for feeding behavior), and the rugose projections {{may have played a}} major role in nest excavation because the mandibles would have prevented such activity. Zigrasimecia most likely interacted with the extinct ant genus Gerontoformica through conflict and probably shared some of their ecological niches. The mandibles of these ants were probably used for mechanical interactions with food, and they may also have served as traps for potential arthropod prey such as mites and small flies. Zigrasimecia was possibly a generalist predator.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} summer of 1855, Gray made his third trip to Europe. This was an {{emergency}} trip to bring home his ill brother-in-law from Paris. Gray spent only three weeks in London and Paris, {{and on the way}} back he read the newly published Géographie botanique raisonnée by Alphonse deCandolle. This was a ground-breaking book {{that for the first time}} brought together the large mass of data being collected by the expeditions of the time. The natural sciences had become <b>highly</b> <b>specialized,</b> yet this book synthesized them to explain living organisms within their environment and why plants were distributed the way they were, all upon a geologic scale. Gray instantly saw that this brought taxonomic botany into focus.|$|E

5|$|In {{the centuries}} that {{followed}} the Reformation, many religious denominations came to Glastonbury to establish chapels and meeting houses. For such a relatively small town, Glastonbury has a remarkably diverse history of Christian places of worship, further enriched {{by the fact that}} several of these movements saw break-away factions, typically setting up new meeting places as a result of doctrinal disagreements, leaving behind them a legacy which would require a <b>highly</b> <b>specialized</b> degree of study in order to chart their respective histories and places of practice. Amongst their number have been Puritans/Undetermined Protestants, Quakers, Independents, Baptists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Wesleyan and Primitive Methodists, Salvationists, Plymouth Brethren, Jehovah's Witnesses and Pentecostals.|$|E
5|$|The sublingua in lemuriform {{primates}} {{is fully}} developed and particularly unique. Tarsiers, which are most {{closely related to}} monkeys and apes (collectively called simians), also have a well-developed but non-specialized sublingua. Simians, however, {{do not have a}} sublingua, although some, such as titis have a <b>highly</b> <b>specialized</b> frenal lamella (plica sublingualis). All primates have a plica sublingualis, and the fimbria linguae (plica fimbriata) found under the tongue of apes may be a vestigial version, although that is still disputed. The structure and appearance of the sublingua, frenal lamella, lingual frenulum, and other sublingual tissue vary greatly between primates, and as a result, their terminology is often confused.|$|E
5|$|At a {{congress}} in 1897 in Halle, the localists founded {{a national organization}} of their own, the Representatives' Centralization of Germany (Vertrauensmänner-Zentralisation Deutschlands). The congress was originally supposed to take place a year earlier, but {{a lack of interest}} forced it to be postponed. There were 37 delegates at the congress representing 6,803 union members. Nearly two-thirds of the delegates came from Berlin or Halle. Almost half the delegates worked in the construction industry, while 14 delegates came from <b>highly</b> <b>specialized</b> professions. The congress decided to establish a five-person Business Commission seated in Berlin to organize political actions, aid in communication between local organizations, and raise financial support for strikes. Fritz Kater became the chairman of the commission. A newspaper, Solidarität (Solidarity), was founded, but the name was changed to Die Einigkeit (Unity) the following year. It initially appeared fortnightly, but was published on a weekly basis beginning in 1898.|$|E

5|$|Frogs {{typically}} {{lay their}} eggs in water. The eggs hatch into aquatic larvae called tadpoles that have tails and internal gills. They have <b>highly</b> <b>specialized</b> rasping mouth parts suitable for herbivorous, omnivorous or planktivorous diets. The life cycle is completed when they metamorphose into adults. A few species deposit eggs on land or bypass the tadpole stage. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on fruit. Frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. They are an important food source for predators {{and part of the}} food web dynamics of many of the world's ecosystems. The skin is semi-permeable, making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. Frogs produce a wide range of vocalizations, particularly in their breeding season, and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviours to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the sublingua in lemurs {{was thought}} to be a vestigial organ {{inherited}} from their mammalian ancestors. In lemuriform primates, the sublingua is used to remove hair and debris from the <b>highly</b> <b>specialized</b> toothcomb, an arrangement of four or six long, forward-facing teeth in the lower jaw used in oral grooming. The toothcomb of lemuriforms consists of both incisors and canine teeth (which reinforce the incisors), and together, these finely spaced teeth act like teeth on a comb. Although the cleaning function has been suspected for nearly a century, there has been no clear confirmation of this. However, a study from 1941 presented evidence that the toothcomb accumulated a mat of hair during oral grooming, and the author did observe that lemurs extend and retract their tongue rapidly, possibly to use the sublingua to clean the toothcomb.|$|E

It is a <b>highly</b> <b>specialized</b> sub-field which examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct group with coerced collective action based on shared interests linked to survival in vocation and combat, with purposes and values that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns civilian-military relations and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies. Topics include the dominant assumptions held by those in the military, changes in military members' willingness to fight, military unionization, military professionalism, the increased utilization of women, the military industrial-academic complex, the military's dependence on research, and the institutional and organizational structure of military.|$|E
