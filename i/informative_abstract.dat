40|$|Background: For {{selection}} {{and evaluation of}} potential biomarkers, inclusion of already published information is of utmost importance. In spite of significant advancements in text- and data-mining techniques, the vast knowledge space of biomarkers in biomedical text has remained unexplored.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify textual features that enhance the effectiveness of biomarker information retrieval for different indication areas and diverse end user perspectives. Methods: A biomarker terminology was created and further organized into six concept classes. Performance of this terminology was optimized towards balanced selectivity and specificity. The information retrieval performance using the biomarker terminology was evaluated based on various combinations of the terminology's six classes. Further validation of these results was performed on two independent corpora representing two different neurodegenerative diseases.

40|$|A {{particular}} {{challenge in}} biomedical text mining {{is to find}} ways of handling ‘comprehensive’ or ‘associative’ queries such as ‘Find all genes associated with breast cancer’. Given that many queries in genomics, proteomics or metabolomics involve these kind of comprehensive searches we believe that a web-based tool that could support these searches would be quite useful. In response to this need, we have developed the PolySearch web server. PolySearch supports > 50 different classes of queries against nearly a dozen different types of text, scientific abstract or bioinformatic databases. The typical query supported by PolySearch is ‘Given X, find all Y's’ where X or Y can be diseases, tissues, cell compartments, gene/protein names, SNPs, mutations, drugs and metabolites. PolySearch also exploits a variety of techniques in text mining and information retrieval to identify, highlight and rank <b>informative</b> <b>abstracts,</b> paragraphs or sentences.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{explore the}} {{accuracy}} of application of the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) tool in epidemiological studies focused on {{the evaluation of the}} role of antibiotics in selecting resistance, and to derive and test an extension of STROBE to improve the suitability of the tool in evaluating the quality of reporting in these area. METHODS: A three-step study was performed. First, a systematic review of the literature analysing the association between antimicrobial exposure and acquisition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and/or multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii was performed. Second, articles were reviewed according to the STROBE checklist for epidemiological studies. Third, a set of potential new items focused on antimicrobial-resistance quality indicators was derived through an expert two-round RAND-modified Delphi procedure and tested on the articles selected through the literature review. RESULTS: The literature search identified 78 studies. Overall, the quality of reporting appeared to be poor in most areas. Five STROBE items, comprising statistical analysis and study objectives, were satisfactory in < 25 % of the studies. <b>Informative</b> <b>abstract,</b> reporting of bias, control of confounding, generalisability and description of study size were missing in more than half the articles. A set of 21 new items was developed and tested. The new items focused particularly on the study setting, antimicrobial usage indicators, and patients epidemiological and clinical characteristics. The performance of the new items in included studies was very low (< 25 %). CONCLUSIONS: Our paper reveals that reporting in epidemiological papers analysing the association between antimicrobial usage and development of resistance is poor.

40|$|The whole part of {{the thesis}} is {{gathered}} and summarized in a very simple composition called abstract. Abstract contains all the information included in the thesis, to help the reader decide whether to read the entire report or not.

Besides, the other important thing to consider in writing an abstract is the generic structure. A good structure of an abstract consists of (1) B (Background) = some background information related to the study, (2) P (Purpose) = the principle activity (or purpose) of the study and its scope, (3) M (Methodology) = some information about the methodology used in the study, (4) R (Result) = the most important results of the study, and (5) C (Conclusion) = a statement of conclusion or recommendation of the study (Weissberg and Buker 1990 : 186). The writer observed that there have been no studies about thesis abstracts done by the English department students of Widya Mandala catholic University. Therefore, the writer conducted this study to investigate (1) the types of thesis abstracts written by the students and (2) the generic structures of thesis abstracts written by the students. In this study, the writer collected twenty theses of the English Department students year 1996 to 2006, and copied the abstracts to be the source of the study. The abstracts then analyzed based on the theories of types of abstract and generic structures of abstract. The results show that (1) the students use the Informative types of abstract; (2) There is only one abstract which is appropriate to the requirement of a good abstract stated by Weissberg and Buker (1990 : 186). Considering the results above, it can be concluded that the English Department Students of Widya Mandala Catholic University use the informative type of abstract and there are only one abstract which is appropriate to the requirement of a good abstract. This study only deals with the types of abstract and the generic structures of abstract.

The result of information retrieval shows improved retrieval rate of <b>informative</b> <b>abstracts,</b> which is achieved by including clinical management terms and evidence of gene/protein alterations (e. g. gene/protein expression status or certain polymorphisms) in combination with disease and gene name recognition. When additional filtering through other classes (e. g. diagnostic or prognostic methods) is applied, the typical high number of unspecific search results is significantly reduced. The evaluation results suggest that this approach enables the automated identification of biomarker information in the literature. A demo version of the search engine SCAIView, including the biomarker retrieval, is made available to the public through [URL]. Conclusions The approach presented in this paper demonstrates that using a dedicated biomarker terminology for automated analysis of the scientific literature maybe helpful as an aid to finding biomarker information in text. Successful extraction of candidate biomarkers information from published resources can be considered as the first step towards developing novel hypotheses. These hypotheses will be valuable for the early decision-making in the drug discovery and development process. </p...|$|R

Note that the first sentence of this section is indented (as required by the JF) using the indentfirst package. A. A Subsection Note that subsections in JF are just labeled with letters. When referring to them in the text, you need to add the section number back, e. g., Section I. B or I. B. 1. This is taken care of in jf. sty. Let’s also add some parenthetical citations (see Stanton (1995), Carpenter, Stanton, and Wallace (2012), Campbell (2003)). To justify adding a subsection here, from now on, we’ll assum...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} shown a gradual shift {{in the content of}} {{biomedical}} publications that is freely accessible, from titles and abstracts to full text. This has enabled new forms of automatic text analysis and has given rise to some interesting questions: How <b>informative</b> is the <b>abstract</b> compared to the full-text? What important information in the full-text is not present in the abstract? What should a good summary contain that is not already in the abstract? Do authors and peers see an article differently? We answer these questions by comparing the information content of the abstract to that in citances—sentences containing citations to that article. We contrast the important points of an article as judged by its authors versus as seen by peers. Focusing on the area of molecular interactions, we perform manual and automatic analysis, and we find that the set of all citances to a target article not only covers most information (entities, functions, experimental methods, and other biological concepts) found in its abstract, but also contains 20 % more concepts. We further present a detailed summary of the differences across information types, and we examine the effects other citations and time have on the content of citances...|$|R
40|$|There {{are some}} statistical-based {{sentence}} extraction methods applied to English documents {{to get the}} automatically summaries. In this paper, we present a Vietnamese text summarization case-study based on evaluation and extraction of highly <b>informative</b> sentences to <b>abstract</b> documents, assisting users in reducing {{the time required to}} study and grasp information in Vietnamese, particularly appropriating to news from Vietnamese sites. Our case-study combines various statistical sentences extraction methods which do not require more linguistic resources whereas provide fast approaches. From a set of sentences, we choose the most important ones depending on an input compression rates and generate a summarized document. Particularly, we use mostly Vietnamese linguistic characteristics to preprocess the source and improve the result. After using some content evaluating methods, comparing with other current approaches, our investigation shows interesting and satisfactory results. We get approximately 0. 73 for the precision of traditional evaluating method, approximately 0. 67 for the average of content similarities.

40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Informative</b> Art display {{systems have}} been {{proposed}} to provide users with information considered relevant at arbitrary points of work or living engagement, originating from many different –mostly geographically dislocated– sources and presented at the periphery of human (visual) perception. Having the displays operate at the periphery of a user's attention allows other user tasks to sustain primary. Much like the information presented by wallclocks, posters, paintings or windows, peripheral displays move {{to the center of}} attention only when appropriate and desirable. Abstract art has been proposed to serve as the visualization paradigm, encoding information into graphical or pictorial artwork by subtly modifying its shape, color and appearance details or its overall impression. This paper approaches a systematic elaboration of visual metaphors able to deliver information via peripheral displays in an aesthetic, artful way. In our approach, the choice of metaphors is driven by the aesthetic appeal of the visual appearance of the display as a whole, out of which certain dynamic emblems or symbols are used to conotate information in a visual style. From experiments we find, that such metaphors are considered by users as a means of personal emotional expression, and that controllable aesthetic attractiveness {{turns out to be the}} dominant factor of display appreciation. The choice of aesthetic themes, as well as the control of emblem and symbol dynamics are supported and implemented in our peripheral display framework, a general purpose software framework for informative art display systems...|$|R
