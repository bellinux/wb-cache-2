5|$|The term <b>greenwashing</b> {{was first}} used by {{environmentalist}} Jay Westerveld when objecting to hotelier's practice of placing notices in hotel rooms which asked their guests to reuse towels to “save the environment”. Westerveld noted {{that there was little}} else to suggest that the hoteliers were interested in reducing their environmental impacts, and that their interest in washing fewer towels seemed to be motivated by a concern to save costs rather than the environment. Since then <b>greenwashing</b> has become a central feature of debates about marketing communications and sustainability, with “awards” for <b>greenwashing</b> established and numerous campaigns, law and advices developed in an attempt to reduce or curb it.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{economic}} model of <b>greenwash,</b> {{in which a}} firm strategi-cally discloses environmental information and a non-governmental organi-zation (NGO) may audit and penalize the firm for failing to fully disclose its environmental impacts. We show that disclosures increase when the likelihood of good environmental performance is lower. Firms with in-termediate levels of environmental performance {{are more likely to}} engage in <b>greenwash.</b> Under certain conditions, NGO punishment of <b>greenwash</b> induces the firm to become less rather than more forthcoming about its environmental performance. We also show that complementarities with NGO auditing may justify public policies encouraging firms to adopt en-vironmental management systems. ...|$|R

40|$|As {{environmentalism}} {{becomes increasingly}} popular, {{the importance of}} environmental language, images and ideas becomes more critical. This paper discusses the significance of environmental communication and its potential role as a “green” cloak for environmentally destructive practices and companies. Although there are many examples of the corporate use of “greenwash”, this paper illustrates the concept using one of Shell Oil’s controversial advertisements from 2007. <b>Greenwash</b> is a communications strategy which uses environmental images and language to make corporate activity appear eco-friendly, {{whether or not it}} is environmentally destructive. Through content analysis, visual decoding, and with reference to findings by regulators, the argument offered here demonstrates the power, and the complex rationale, behind <b>greenwash</b> activity. Contextualising the critical dissection of the advertisement in question within academic debates over the role and prevalence of <b>greenwash,</b> the paper illustrates how this approach has become an important communication tool, often associated with public relations spin. A multitude of equivalent advertisements, and the growing discussion about environmental responsibility and corporate <b>greenwash,</b> indicate the need for significant research in this field...|$|R

30|$|<b>Greenwash</b> {{is where}} {{corporate}} environmental performance is overstated (Deegan and Rankin, 1996), whereas brownwash is where green credentials are understated (Kim and Lyon, 2014). For example, <b>greenwash</b> is possible when stakeholders have no direct measures {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions and rely on managers to address modeling complexity, estimation processes and assumptions made behind data disclosed. Management have discretion as to whether to recognise greenhouse gas emissions, and whether and how to manipulate measures and perceptions of greenhouse emissions (Hrasky, 2011). Likewise, brownwash is encouraged by fear of adverse stock market reactions to emphasis being placed on environmental performance, such as winning green awards, rather than monetary performance (Kim and Lyon, 2014). Both <b>greenwash</b> and brownwash can diminish the usefulness of external environmental accounting initiatives {{in the eyes of}} stakeholders as management retain considerable discretion over the environmental issues to recognise, how to measure these, and what to disclose. Skepticism about the veracity of reported environmental accounting disclosures leads to lost credibility of the data.|$|R

40|$|Corporate <b>greenwash</b> has {{accelerated}} in recent years, bringing {{in its wake}} growing skepticism about corporate green claims. Although a theory of the drivers and deterrents of <b>greenwash</b> has begun to emerge, it is static in nature and does not incorporate {{the full range of}} ways in which firms can misrepresent their environmental performance. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we extend the theory of organizational information disclosure to incorporate the possibility of undue modesty about a firm’s environmental, social and governance practices. Second, we hypothesize about the drivers of exaggeration and undue modesty based on which of a firm’s stakeholders are salient at a given point in time; to do so we place the firm within a dynamic context that has largely been missing in the prior literature. Third, we test our hypotheses using a dataset that allows us to directly compare corporate green claims against actual performance. Results reveal that corporate output growth, deregulation, and low profits under deregulation significantly affect the choice between <b>greenwash</b> and brownwash. The effects of growth and profits are mitigated by external scrutiny...|$|R

BP's 2008 budget included $20 billion in fossil fuel investment and $1.5 billion in all alternative forms of energy.

2500|$|There are ambiguities in the {{definition}} of green chemistry, and in how it is understood among broader science, policy, and business communities. Even within chemistry, researchers have used the term [...] "green chemistry" [...] to describe a range of work independently of the framework put forward by Anastas and Warner (i.e., the 12 principles). While not all uses of the term are [...] legitimate (see <b>greenwashing),</b> many are, and the authoritative status of any single definition is uncertain. More broadly, the idea of green chemistry can easily be linked (or confused) with related concepts like green engineering, environmental design, or sustainability in general.
