5000|$|... air cleaner: an {{oil bath}} air cleaner, {{originally}} used for tractors and other vehicles in dusty environments, was <b>fitted</b> to <b>handle</b> the dust of off-road use and to allow easier field maintenance. Oil bath cleaners require only the addition of standard motor oil rather than replaceable filters.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, by heaven, {{you are not}} <b>fit</b> to <b>handle</b> {{that ship}} among these rocks and breakers!" [...] exclaimed Griffith; [...] "your men of a light draught never know their water; 'tis the deep keel only that finds a channel;--pilot! pilot! beware how you trifle with us ignorantly; for 'tis a {{dangerous}} experiment to play at hazards with an enemy." ...|$|R

25|$|Tools, {{originally}} {{made of wood}} or bone, {{were bound}} to handles with leather straps. During the Bronze Age, {{they were made of}} bronze with wooden handles. Due to its round hole, the tool head would spin on the handle. The Minoans developed oval-shaped holes in their tools to <b>fit</b> oval-shaped <b>handles,</b> which prevented spinning. Tools included double adzes, double- and single-bladed axes, axe-adzes, sickles and chisels.|$|R
50|$|Sejong the Great of Korea commented, in 1443, {{that using}} Chinese {{characters}} for Korean was “like trying to <b>fit</b> a square <b>handle</b> into a round hole”. He subsequently developed the Hangul phonetic alphabet.|$|R

30|$|As {{streaming}} data contains timestamp values within each sequenced message element. MongoDB {{is a great}} <b>fit</b> to <b>handle</b> timestamped data and many organizations are using it [128]. Some proprietary services are also available and popular in the community, like MongoDB Management Service (MMS) which models and displays the time-series data as a dashboard [129]. This facilitates a developer to develop visualization and alerts on different datasets using metrics.|$|R
50|$|Mikhail Gorbachev, {{the then}} Central Committee Secretary Responsible for Agriculture, tried to {{establish}} nationwide committee's which would oversee the reform's implementation. Nikolai Tikhonov, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, objected to this, {{believing that the}} central ministries were <b>fit</b> to <b>handle</b> the reform's implementation themselves. According to Martin McCauley, the author behind Gorbachev, Tikhonov objected because he believed Gorbachev was trying {{to take his place}} as Council of Ministers chairman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. Flint, beside himself; [...] "incredible {{as it may}} seem, he does. I have Austen Vane {{to thank}} for still another favour--he is {{responsible}} for Hilary's condition to-day. He has broken him down--he has made him an imbecile. The convention is scarcely thirty-six hours off, and Hilary is about as <b>fit</b> to <b>handle</b> it as--as Eben Fitch. Hilary, who never failed me in his life!" ...|$|R
25|$|The 357/2, {{have started}} to receive a refurbishment. This is almost {{identical}} to the 357/3, however {{there has been no}} seats removed and no grab <b>handles</b> <b>fitted.</b> A similar refurbishment will be placed onto the 357/0.|$|R

2500|$|In notable {{readings}} of this legend, only Rabbi Akiba was <b>fit</b> to <b>handle</b> {{the study of}} mystical doctrines. The Tosafot, medieval commentaries on the Talmud, say that the four sages [...] "did not go up literally, but it appeared to {{them as if they}} went up". On the other hand, Rabbi Louis Ginzberg, writes in the Jewish Encyclopedia (1901–1906) that the journey to paradise [...] "is to be taken literally and not allegorically".|$|R
6000|$|VALENTINE. Oh, never mind. Something {{to put my}} foot on, to get the {{necessary}} purchase for a good pull. (Crampton looks alarmed in spite of himself. Valentine stands upright and places the glass with the forceps in it ready to his hand, chatting on with provoking indifference.) And so you advise me not to get married, Mr. Crampton? (He stoops to <b>fit</b> the <b>handle</b> on the apparatus by which the chair is raised and lowered.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{can hardly}} {{tell you how}} much I regret not knowing {{something}} about the treatment of simple surgical cases. If when with W---- I had studied the practical--bled, drawn teeth, mixed medicines, rolled legs perpetually, it would have been worth something. Surely I might have foreseen all this! I really don't know how to find the time or the opportunity for learning. How true it is that men require to be trained for their particular work! I am now just in a position to know what to learn were I once more in England. Spend one day with old Fry (mason), another with John Venn (carpenter), and two every week at the Exeter hospital, and not look on and see others work-- there's the mischief, do it oneself. Make a chair, a table, a box; fit everything; help in every part of making and furnishing a house, that is, a cottage. Do enough of every part {{to be able to do}} the whole. Begin by felling a tree; saw it into planks, mix the lime, see the right proportion of sand, &c., know how to choose a good lot of timber, <b>fit</b> <b>handles</b> for tools, &c.|$|R
50|$|On 31 August 2009 Infraero {{unveiled}} {{an ambitious}} BRL 5.3 billion (USD 2.8 billion, EUR 2.0 billion) investment plan to renovate and upgrade airports of ten cities {{focusing on the}} preparations for the 2014 FIFA World Cup which held in Brazil. At the occasion {{it was announced that}} even though Salvador da Bahia is one of the venue cities, the plan excluded its airport because renovations had been recently completed and Infraero considered the airport <b>fit</b> to <b>handle</b> the forthcoming increases in traffic.|$|R
5000|$|Workers {{were to be}} {{selected}} appropriately for each task. {{one of the very}} first requirements for a man who is <b>fit</b> to <b>handle</b> pig iron as a regular occupation is that he shall be so stupid and so phlegmatic that he more nearly resembles in his mental make-up the ox than any other type. The man who is mentally alert and intelligent is for this very reason entirely unsuited to what would, for him, be the grinding monotony of work of this character.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm failing, Carry," [...] he said, sorrowfully. [...] "I'm not <b>fit</b> to <b>handle</b> these man's-size schemes any longer. Peddling oranges in a push-cart {{is about}} the {{suitable}} graft for me. When I said ten thousand, I swear I thought I had sized up that brown man's limit to within two cents. He'd have melted down for fifteen thousand just as easy. Say--Carry--you'll see old man Keogh safe in some nice, quiet idiot asylum, won't you, if he makes a break like that again?" ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} nature of {{operational}} research and its interactions with performance measurement and strategy. It is argued that operational research (OR) is well <b>fitted</b> to <b>handle</b> strategic issues as the modelling approach of OR facilitates understanding and learning, and the evaluation of strategies prior to action. The development of problem structuring methods is also a key aid to strategy and policy formulation. OR is also beginning {{to play a role}} in performance measurement and there is an opportunity for OR to lead in the improvement of performance measurement systems...|$|R
50|$|In October 1931 the Segal Lock and Hardware Company sued Gillette (brand), asking $2,000,000 {{in a loss}} of blade contract. The suit {{claimed a}} {{violation}} of the Clayton Antitrust Act. Another suit, decided in Boston, Massachusetts, resulted in an agreement between Segal and Gillette. The former agreed to discontinue the manufacture of razor blades which infringed the Gillette patent. Segal continued to manufacture its own razors and blades which fit their own razors. However they were forced to discontinue making blades which also <b>fit</b> razor <b>handles</b> made by Gillette.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly a great {{procession}} was formed, {{headed by}} the President and ended by the priests. In {{the centre of the}} line marched Ithiel bearing the babe Miriam, to his evident delight, and Nehushta, who instructed him so vigorously that at length he grew confused and nearly let it fall. Thereon, setting this detail of the judgment at defiance, Nehushta snatched it from his arms, calling him a clumsy and ignorant clown only <b>fit</b> to <b>handle</b> an ox. To this Ithiel made no answer, nor was he at all wroth, but finished the journey walking behind her and smiling foolishly.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper modifies {{a recent}} robust {{parametric}} macromodeling technique called Multivariate Orthonormal Vector <b>Fitting</b> (MOVF), to <b>handle</b> noisy data in an output error estimation framework. The new method provides accurate and compact rational parametric macromodels based on measurements {{in the frequency}} domain. The performance of the multivariate method is shown on simulation {{as well as on}} real measurements...|$|R
50|$|Mops for pre-moisting {{are flat}} sheets of (often microfiber) textile, usually about 15 cm wide, {{and comes in}} {{variable}} lengths (usually 30 - 100 cm). Mops for pre-moisting are fastened on a handle with a flat pad mount {{with the aid of}} velcro or a pouch on the mop, in which the pad on the <b>handle</b> <b>fits.</b>|$|R

They are the official grippers of the Arnold Sports Festival, the GNC Grip Gauntlet, United States Arm Wrestling and the World’s Strongest Man contest.|$|R
5000|$|While not {{technically}} an expansion, details on an aesthetic gun accessory for the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, named the [...] "Sharp Shooter", {{have been released}} by third-party manufacturer Joytech. In this accessory, the Wii Remote is housed in the gun barrel. The Nunchuk is <b>fitted</b> into the <b>handle</b> so that the Nunchuk's buttons serve as gun triggers.|$|R
25|$|In later years, {{three other}} changes were made. One was {{the removal of}} the Sea Dart system, {{creating}} an increased deck park for aircraft. The Sea Dart magazines were converted to increase air-to-surface weapons stowage, and new aircrew briefing facilities created under the extended flight deck, both to support the embarkation of RAF Harrier GR7s as a routine part of the air group. The ships were all <b>fitted</b> to <b>handle</b> Merlin helicopters as the Merlin HM1 replaced the Sea King HAS6 in the carrier-borne ASW role. Following the integration of the Harrier GR7, typical deployments included seven or eight of those aircraft, pushing the Merlin onto the carrier's accompanying Fort-class auxiliaries.|$|R
2500|$|Digging {{began in}} late June, but even Grant and Meade saw the {{operation}} as, [...] "A mere {{way to keep}} the men occupied," [...] and doubted it of any actual tactical value. They quickly lost interest and Pleasants soon found himself with few materials for his project, to the extent that his men had to forage for wood to support the structure. Work progressed steadily, however. Earth was removed by hand and packed into improvised sledges made from cracker boxes <b>fitted</b> with <b>handles,</b> and the floor, wall, and ceiling of the mine were shored up with timbers from an abandoned wood mill and even from tearing down an old bridge.|$|R

50|$|The RD500LC uses twin {{ventilated}} disc brakes {{for the front}} wheel with a single {{ventilated disc}} at the rear. A solo seat cowl was originally provided to cover the pillion seat when not in use. The Japanese market RZV500R differs from the RD500 by not having a rear-mounted pillion grab <b>handle</b> <b>fitted</b> (which gives a cleaner, more race-oriented look to the motorcycle).|$|R
50|$|The {{pedestal}} desk {{is also one}} of the two principal forms of the big campaign desk, used by the military in the past. It can then be considered a portable desk in a limited way since the writing surface could be easily separated from the pedestals, to facilitate transport. The three separate elements were often <b>fitted</b> with large <b>handles</b> on the sides.|$|R
50|$|There are {{differences}} from brand to brand, but the common features of standard grippers {{are that they}} use a torsion spring <b>fitted</b> with two <b>handles.</b> The exact dimensions of these elements vary, {{as well as the}} materials used to make them; the springs are made from various types of steel, and the handles are generally made from wood, plastic, steel or aluminum.|$|R
