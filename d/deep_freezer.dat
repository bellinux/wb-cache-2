Constructing a knight costume out of cardboard, he makes his way to Brooklyn to attend the party, only to discover it is actually a trap set by a group of deranged art students. The art students, in costume, include Paul (a gothic vampire), Macon (a werewolf), Sky (a zombie cheerleader), Lexi (Daryl Hannah's replicant character from Blade Runner), and Bill (a Baseball Fury from The Warriors). They intend to commit a murder as a piece of artwork to impress Alexander, their wealthy and sinister patron, in the hopes that they will receive a large arts grant from Alexander. Christopher has brought along a loaf of pumpkin raisin bread, which Sky starts to eat. She then reveals that she is allergic to non-organic raisins, and didn't know about them. The group asks if she'll be OK, and she agrees explaining she's only a little dizzy and needs to sit down, however she falls over and hits her head on some old machinery and dies.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Changes in the {{nutrient}} composition during storage of plantain, banana, yam and cocoyam using different storage {{methods have been}} investigated. It {{has been shown that}} there was an increase in moisture content of banana and plantain during storage in open air, (28. 2 ± 0. 10 to 30. 2 ± 0. 03 % for banana and 31. 6 ± 0. 18 to 34. 1 ± 02 % for plantain) after 9 days of storage. These were followed by a slight decrease in the deep refrigerator storage and then an over all increase in the <b>deep</b> <b>freezer</b> storage [...] Small changes were observed in crude protein and ether extracts during open air storage of banana and plantain as well as yam and cocoyam. A general trend of lowest nutrient values during <b>deep</b> <b>freezer</b> storage has been observed. It thus seems that storage of banana, plantain is better in a refrigerator than open air probably due to the minimized nutrient loss caused by metabolic activities such as respiration and sprouting. It should however be noted that for these food items, open air storage was in fact better than deep-freezer storage provided consumption is hastened since the <b>deep</b> <b>freezer</b> subjected the food stuffs to chilling injury and nutrient loss...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{success of}} {{immunization}} depends highly {{on the level}} of cold chain maintenance. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the condition of cold chain equipment, practices adopted for cold chain maintenance and knowledge of the vaccinators. Methods: It was a cross-sectional study conducted in 20 UHCs of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC). Cold chain equipment were observed with regards to their condition, along with the practices adopted by vaccinators for cold chain maintenance. A pre-designed and pre-tested questionnaire was used to interview the vaccinators regarding their knowledge and awareness regarding cold chain practices, management and handling. Data were entered and analyzed using Epi Info v 3. 5. 1. Simple proportions were calculated. Results: Absence of separate stabilizer for deep freezers and ILRs (85 %), ill-maintained temperature-record register, lack of criss-cross pattern of ice packs in <b>deep</b> <b>freezer</b> (65 %), presence of things other than ice packs in <b>deep</b> <b>freezer</b> (10 %) and things other than vaccines in ILR (10 %) indicate poor cold chain maintenance. In addition to this, expired vaccines in ILR (5 %), vaccines in the "unusable" stages of VVM (15 %), lack of emergency contact number nearby in case of cold chain failure (85 %), lack of inverter (85 %), lack of generator (85 %) and failure to note time of reconstitution on the vaccine vial at the time of vaccination (25 %) indicate poor cold chain practices. Lack of knowledge of defrosting of ILR and <b>deep</b> <b>freezer</b> (45 %), lack of knowledge about Shake test (40 %), lack of knowledge of temperature range to be maintained in <b>deep</b> <b>freezer</b> (70 %) and in ILR (15 %) indicate poor knowledge of vaccinators.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{develops}} {{methods for}} state estima-tion of aggregated thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) in smart grids, via partial differential equation (PDE) techniques. TCLs include on/off controlled devices, such as heat pumps, HVAC systems, and <b>deep</b> <b>freezers.</b> Control of aggregated TCLs provides a promising opportunity {{to mitigate the}} mismatch between power generation and demand, thus enhancing grid reliability and enabling renewable energy penetration. However, persistent communication between thousands of TCLs to a central server can be prohibitive. To this end, this paper focuses on designing a state estimation scheme for a PDE-based model of aggregated TCLs, thus reducing the required communication. First, a two-state linear hyperbolic PDE model for homogenous TCL populations is presented. This model is extended to heterogeneous populations by including a diffusive term. Next, a state observer is derived, which uses only measurements of how many TCLs turn on/off at any given time. The design is proven to be exponentially stable via backstepping techniques. Finally, the observer’s properties are demonstrated via simulation examples. The estimator provides system-critical information for power system monitoring and control. I...|$|R
