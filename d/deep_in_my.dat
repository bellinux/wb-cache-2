5|$|Later in 1954 Donen made <b>Deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart, a {{biography}} of the Hungarian-born American operetta composer Sigmund Romberg starring José Ferrer. The film included cameos by many MGM contract actors, including the only screen pairing of Gene Kelly and his brother Fred. Although it received mediocre reviews, Romberg's cult status and popularity helped make the film a hit financially.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, Powell {{starred in}} Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, {{opposite}} Howard Keel, which {{gave her the}} opportunity to play a more mature character than in previous films. Her other films include: Rich, Young and Pretty (1951), Small Town Girl (1953), Three Sailors and a Girl (1953), Athena (1954), <b>Deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart (1954), Hit the Deck (1955) and The Girl Most Likely (1957).|$|E

Davidson in 1953's Miss Sadie Thompson (a remake of Rain) {{opposite}} Rita Hayworth; Barney Greenwald, the embittered defense attorney, in 1954's The Caine Mutiny; and operetta composer Sigmund Romberg in the MGM musical biopic <b>Deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart. In 1955 Ferrer directed {{himself in the}} film version of The Shrike, with June Allyson. The Cockleshell Heroes followed a year later, along with The Great Man, both of which he also directed. In 1958 Ferrer directed and appeared in I Accuse! (as Alfred Dreyfus) and The High Cost of Loving. Ferrer also directed, but did not appear in, Return to Peyton Place in 1961 and also the remake of State Fair in 1962.|$|E
60|$|He {{affected}} cheerful {{acceptance of}} my somewhat officious proposal to accompany him. I {{could see that}} he was annoyed by it, and that fact fastened <b>deeper</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind the conviction that he was meditating some act of treachery.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Boone," [...] {{said the}} latter, with an oath, [...] "I'm not goin' to hang {{off and on}} any longer.

50|$|The near {{approach}} {{of war and}} its effects are horrible beyond what you can conceive. The whole road from Prague to Teplitz was covered with waggons full of wounded, dead, and dying. The shock and disgust and pity produced by such scenes are beyond what I could have supposed possible...the scenes of distress and misery have sunk <b>deeper</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind. I have been quite haunted by them.|$|R
500|$|In {{the same}} year, Doro Pesch {{contributed to the}} benefit CD for the museum {{association}} of Borussia Dortmund the song entitled [...] "Tief in meinem Herzen" [...] (<b>Deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart), {{a modified version of}} her classic [...] "Für Immer" [...] re-written for this purpose. She also did a live performance at the Westfalen Stadium before a game of Borussia Dortmund {{and was one of the}} first visitors in Borusseum, when it opened. Her father was a fan of Borussia, she said in an interview with the spokesperson of the BVB.|$|E
500|$|... "Porcelain" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Moby for his fifth studio album Play (1999) and recorded in his Little Italy, Manhattan apartment. He found the inspiration to compose the song from his experiences with an unidentified woman; speaking to Billboard, he explained: [...] "I {{was involved with}} this really, really wonderful woman, and I loved her very much. But I knew <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart of hearts that we had no business being romantically involved. So, it's sort of about being {{in love with someone}} but knowing you shouldn't be with them." [...] Moby initially disliked the track, criticizing his production as [...] "mushy" [...] and his vocals as [...] "really weak". He had dismissed [...] "Porcelain" [...] as [...] "average" [...] and later recalled that he [...] "couldn't imagine anyone else wanting to listen to it" [...] – however, he was eventually talked into including it on Play.|$|E
500|$|Many {{people believe}} that Donen owed {{everything}} to Kelly, and Kelly biographer Clive Hirschhorn described Donen as having [...] "no particular identity or evident talent... and {{was just a kid}} from the south who wanted to make it in show business." [...] Donen stated that he moved to Hollywood of his own accord; other sources state that he followed Kelly, who then helped him get his first job. Kelly would sometimes embarrass and patronize Donen in public, such as berating him {{for not being able to}} keep up with his dance steps during the rehearsals for Cover Girl. Donen has admitted that he did not consider himself to be a great performer. Despite Donen's growing resentment of Kelly, he was able to contain his feelings and professional attitude during their collaborations. Tensions between the two exploded on the set of It's Always Fair Weather. After Donen's recent hits <b>Deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers he did not want to make another film with Kelly. They fought on the set for the first time, with the now more confident Donen asserting himself. Donen almost quit the film, and his friendship with Kelly ended.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a recounting of {{processes}} and works {{manifested in the}} studio between 2011 and 2013. The bulk of this text, however, is composed of various written personal and autobiographical vignettes, future hopes, and experiences.

2500|$|Carl states that: [...] "It was she [...] who {{introduced}} me to science fiction and fantasy in general and Tolkien in particular." [...] and [...] "Recently I re-read my first published fantasy novels.

2500|$|Robinson {{answered}} his critics {{the following year}} with A Quiet Storm, released in 1975. The album launched three singles – the number-one R hit [...] "Baby That's Backatcha", [...] "The Agony & The Ecstasy" [...] and [...] "Quiet Storm". However, Robinson's solo career suffered from his work as Motown's vice president, and his own music took the backseat. As a result, several albums including Smokey's Family Robinson, <b>Deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Soul, Love Breeze and Smokin, saw poor promotion and received bad reviews. At this point Robinson relied on other writers and producers {{to help him with}} his albums.|$|E

60|$|She frowned with impatience and her {{disappointment}} {{was greater}} than necessary. When I left her {{at the corner of}} the lane I felt a sting of her <b>deep</b> reproach <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind. I always felt the reproach when she had gone.|$|R
6000|$|For a {{long time}} it seemed I was repeating again and again with soundless lips and finding the <b>deepest</b> comfort <b>in</b> <b>my</b> words:--"And out of our agonies comes victory, out of our agonies comes victory! Have pity on us, God our Father!" ...|$|R

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of the 20th of last month, in the choir, after I had celebrated Mass I yielded to a {{drowsiness}} similar to a sweet sleep. [...] I saw before me a mysterious person similar to the one I had seen on the evening of 5 August. The only difference was that his hands and feet and side were dripping blood. This sight terrified me and what I felt at that moment is indescribable. I thought I should have died if the Lord had not intervened and strengthened my heart which was about to burst out of my chest. The vision disappeared and I became aware that my hands, feet and side were dripping blood. Imagine the agony I experienced and continue to experience almost every day. The heart wound bleeds continually, especially from Thursday evening until Saturday. Dear Father, I am dying of pain because of the wounds and the resulting embarrassment I feel <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> soul. I am afraid I shall bleed to death if the Lord does not hear my heartfelt supplication to relieve me of this condition. Will Jesus, who is so good, grant me this grace? Will he at least free me from the embarrassment caused by these outward signs? I will raise my voice and will not stop imploring him until in his mercy he takes away, not the wound or the pain, which is impossible since I wish to be inebriated with pain, but these outward signs which cause me such embarrassment and unbearable humiliation....the pain was so intense that I began to feel as if I were dying on the cross.|$|E
2500|$|When Kelly {{returned}} to Hollywood in 1953, the film musical was {{already beginning to}} feel the pressures from television, and MGM cut the budget for his next picture Brigadoon (1954), with Cyd Charisse, forcing {{him to make the}} film on studio back lots instead of on location in Scotland. This year also saw him appear as guest star with his brother Fred in the celebrated I Love to Go Swimmin' with Wimmen routine in <b>Deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart. MGM's refusal to loan him out for Guys and Dolls and Pal Joey put further strains on his relationship with the studio. He negotiated an exit to his contract which involved making three further pictures for MGM. The first of these, It's Always Fair Weather (1956) co-directed with Donen, was a musical satire on television and advertising, and includes his famous roller skate dance routine to I Like Myself, and a dance trio with Michael Kidd and Dan Dailey that Kelly used to experiment with the widescreen possibilities of Cinemascope. MGM had lost faith in Kelly's box-office appeal, and as a result It's Always Fair Weather [...] "premiered" [...] at seventeen drive-in theatres around the Los Angeles metroplex. Next followed Kelly's last musical film for MGM, Les Girls (1957), in which he partnered a trio of leading ladies, Mitzi Gaynor, Kay Kendall, and Taina Elg. It too sold few movie tickets. The third picture he completed was a co-production between MGM and himself, a cheapie B-film, The Happy Road, set in his beloved France, his first foray in a new role as producer-director-actor. After leaving MGM, Kelly {{returned to}} stage work.|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from her}} Communist Party membership, her Irish {{heritage}} {{is the other}} sensitive aspect of Murdoch's political life that seems to attract interest. [...] Part of the interest revolves around the fact that, although Irish by both birth and traced descent on both sides, Murdoch does not display the full set of political opinions that are sometimes assumed to go with this origin: [...] "No one ever agrees about who is entitled to lay claim to Irishness. [...] Iris's Belfast cousins today call themselves British, not Irish... with both parents brought up in Ireland, and an ancestry within Ireland both North and South going back three centuries, Iris has as valid a claim to call herself Irish as most North Americans have to call themselves American". [...] Conradi notes A.N. Wilson's record that Murdoch regretted the sympathetic portrayal of the Irish nationalist cause she had given earlier in The Red and the Green, and a competing defence of the book at Caen in 1978. The novel while broad of sympathy is hardly an unambiguous celebration of the 1916 rising, dwelling upon bloodshed, unintended consequences and the evils of romanticism, besides celebrating selfless individuals on both sides. Later, of Ian Paisley, Iris Murdoch stated [...] " [...] sincerely condemns violence and {{did not intend to}} incite the Protestant terrorists. That he is emotional and angry is not surprising, after 12–15 years of murderous IRA activity. All this business is <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> soul, I'm afraid." [...] In private correspondence with her close friend and fellow philosopher Philippa Foot, she remarked in 1978 that she felt [...] "unsentimental about Ireland to the point of hatred" [...] and, of a Franco-Irish conference she had attended in Caen in 1982, said that [...] "the sounds of all those Irish voices made me feel privately sick".|$|E
