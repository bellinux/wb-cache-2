500|$|Fanning {{has stated}} that {{although}} political messages may be common throughout his and Powderfinger's music, {{it is not the}} central focus when writing songs: [...] "A balance has to be struck in a lot of ways, in the sense that primarily I'm a musician. I'm not a political commentator. So <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> a song that has political content, then hopefully that song is a good enough song to make it onto my record. And if it's not, then that's just a song that I've written. So I don't think it necessarily needs to be that you're definitively trying to make a political statement." [...] He {{has stated that}} he has no interest in [...] "doing a 'Peter Garrett'", who entered politics after a successful Midnight Oil career.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 69 he was 'rejuvenated' by the Steinach {{operation}} {{which was}} performed on 6 April 1934 by Norman Haire. For {{the last five years}} of his life Yeats found a new vigour evident from both his poetry and his intimate relations with younger women. During this time, Yeats was involved in a number of romantic affairs with, among others, the poet and actress Margot Ruddock, and the novelist, journalist and sexual radical Ethel Mannin. As in his earlier life, Yeats found erotic adventure conducive to his creative energy, and, despite age and ill-health, he remained a prolific writer. In a letter of 1935, Yeats noted: [...] "I find my present weakness made worse by the strange second puberty the operation has given me, the ferment that has come upon my imagination. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> poetry it will be unlike anything I have done". In 1936, he undertook editorship of the Oxford Book of Modern Verse, 1892–1935.|$|E
500|$|During {{their writing}} sessions, Malay noticed Ocean's use of gender pronouns in his lyrics, but {{attributed}} it to Ocean's poetic license {{rather than his}} sexuality. In an interview after Ocean's open letter, Malay called him [...] "the new hybrid of what an MC {{used to be in}} the '80s or '90s ... the true storyteller" [...] and said of the lyrics, [...] "I don't think anyone during any given point during the creative process knew what was happening ... when he's singing maybe from a female perspective or whatever, it's a story, it's a world that he created. It's not necessarily his personal—like something that he's experiencing. Maybe it is and it's a metaphor the way he did it". They finished writing Channel Orange in two to three months. Ocean said of the album's development in an interview for Rap-Up, [...] "It succinctly defines me as an artist for where I am right now and that was the aim. It's about the stories. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> 14 stories that I love, then the next step is to get the environment of music around it to best envelop the story and all kinds of sonic goodness." ...|$|E

500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. I have to go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E

However, a month earlier, a re-mastered version of the song had already leaked. About the prospective single he said: [...] "It succinctly defines me as an artist for where I am right now {{and that was the}} aim," [...] he said of the follow-up to his acclaimed Nostalgia, Ultra. [...] "It's about the stories. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> 14 stories that I love, then {{the next step is to}} get the environment of music around it to best envelop the story and all kinds of sonic goodness." ...|$|E
