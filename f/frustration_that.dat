5|$|At an {{unscheduled}} session, Albert expresses his <b>frustration</b> <b>that</b> {{while his}} speech has improved when talking to most people, he still stammers when talking to David and reveals {{the extent of}} Edward VIII's folly with Simpson. When Lionel insists that Bertie {{could be a good}} king, Bertie accuses Lionel of speaking treason and quits Lionel. Bertie must face the Ascension Council without any assistance from Lionel.|$|E
5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay falling asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce <b>frustration</b> <b>that</b> further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a person may be advised {{to get out of bed}} and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{believed}} she had showed Spain that the French monarchy, {{far from being}} financially ruined and at war with its nobles, remained a glorious {{force to be reckoned}} with, capable of financing displays on a stunning scale, backed by a unified court. The point was lost on the grim Duke of Alba, however. His letters reveal his <b>frustration</b> <b>that</b> Catherine’s spectacles kept interrupting the serious business of discussing how to make war on the Protestants. In the end, the Spanish decided the whole meeting been a waste of time, since Catherine had refused to change her policy towards the Huguenots in the slightest. The Huguenots, however, believed that their banishment from the talks between the two negotiating teams meant that Catherine had struck a secret deal with the Spanish to persecute them.|$|E

5|$|Many {{commentators}} and cricketers deplored {{the use of}} Bodyline bowling. Some felt <b>frustration</b> <b>that</b> Woodfull had {{not publicly}} condemned the tactics, believing that his silence was interpreted as approval. Once his opinions were revealed by the leak, opponents of Bodyline felt publicly legitimised and expressed their opinions more freely. It also revealed deep and unaccustomed divisions between the teams which had been kept from view. The leak and subsequent events in the same match brought varied opinions from journalists and former players on Bodyline into the newspapers, both for and against Bodyline tactics.|$|E
5|$|On January 16, 1967, President Lyndon Johnson {{nominated}} Combs to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, {{replacing the}} deceased Shackelford Miller, Jr., and the Senate confirmed the nomination on April 5, 1967. Because {{of the rules}} of the federal judiciary, Combs had to liquidate his business and banking assets and severely restrict contact with many of his political acquaintances to avoid potential conflicts of interest with cases he might adjudicate on the Court of Appeals. He expressed <b>frustration</b> <b>that</b> the cases that came before the court were frequently appealed to the Supreme Court, which often gave little weight to the opinions rendered by the Court of Appeals. Consequently, he resigned from the court on June 5, 1970, and joined the Louisville law firm of Tarrant, Combs, and Bullitt (later Wyatt, Tarrant & Combs).|$|E
5|$|Beginning in January 2009, Rajoelina led {{a series}} of {{political}} rallies in downtown Antananarivo where he gave voice to the <b>frustration</b> <b>that</b> Ravalomanana's policies had triggered, particularly among the economically marginalized {{and members of the}} political opposition. On 3 February, Ravalomanana dismissed Rajoelina as mayor of Antananarivo and appointed a special delegation headed by Guy Randrianarisoa to manage the affairs of the capital. Rajoelina incited demonstrators on 7 February to occupy the president's office in Ambohitsorohitra Palace in central Antananarivo. The presidential guard opened fire on the advancing crowd, killing 31 and wounding more than 200. Ravalomanana became the third president since independence (after Ratsiraka and Philibert Tsiranana) to allow the defense forces to shoot at civilians; several months later, at a demonstration led by Ravalomanana supporters, Rajoelina would become the fourth president to authorize such an action. Popular disapproval of Ravalomanana intensified and polarized some in favor of his resignation, although perceptions of Rajoelina as an alternative remained mixed. Conflicts between pro-Rajoelina demonstrators and security forces continued over the following weeks, resulting in several additional deaths.|$|E

5000|$|Fran Mirabella II of IGN {{said of the}} game, [...] "From the hostage-taking {{dynamics}} to the controls, {{the experience}} just feels unpolished. It can be fun, {{but there are a}} lot of <b>frustrations</b> <b>that</b> come along with it to sour the experience a little." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} visual effects, the closing sequence required ADR due to the sound of rain on the original filming. The visual effects were the director Dan Zeff's idea, and the writers were pleased that they were within budget. They also serve to tie the final shot to the opening shot of the episode, as both feature a raven. Scenes that were cut down in the editing process included the initial meeting between the witchfinders—Warren and Clarke—and Sir Andrew Pike, and a private discussion between Warren and Clarke after {{the first day of the}} trial. The extended versions of the scenes featured an explanation about the Devil being found in everyday objects and a discussion about the stages of torture respectively. Shearsmith expressed <b>frustration</b> <b>that</b> these extra scenes could not be included on the DVD release.|$|E
5|$|The new {{constitution}} came into force on 24 September 1993, and Sihanouk was reinstated as the King of Cambodia. A permanent coalition government was formed between FUNCINPEC, CPP {{and a third}} political party, the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party (BLDP). In turn, Sihanouk made Ranariddh and Hun Sen First and Second Prime Ministers, respectively. Shortly after that, Sihanouk left for Beijing, where he spent several months for cancer treatment. In April 1994 Sihanouk returned, and the following month called the government to hold new elections so that the Khmer Rouge could be co-opted into the government. Both Ranariddh and Hun Sen rejected his suggestion, but Sihanouk pressed on, and further proposed a national unity government consisting of FUNCINPEC, CPP, and the Khmer Rouge headed by him. Again, both prime ministers rejected Sihanouk's proposal, arguing that Khmer Rouge's past intransigent attitude made the proposal unrealistic. Sihanouk backed down, and expressed <b>frustration</b> <b>that</b> Hun Sen and Ranariddh had been ignoring him. As both Norodom Sirivudh and Julio Jeldres, his younger half-brother and official biographer, respectively, saw it, this was a clear sign that the monarchy's ability to exert control over national affairs had diminished, at least vis-a-vis the prime ministers.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his administration, {{enrollment}} {{rates in}} {{primary and secondary}} education remained high and private-school enrollment increased, but overall literacy and test scores improved only slightly.

2500|$|Professor {{and author}} Cornel West {{addressed}} the <b>frustrations</b> <b>that</b> {{some critics have}} expressed at the protest’s lack of a clear and unified message, saying, [...] "It’s impossible to translate {{the issue of the}} greed of Wall Street into one demand, or two demands.

25|$|Anspaugh also {{expressed}} <b>frustration</b> <b>that</b> although a managed forest fire in Canada on 3 August 1985 {{is said to}} have been lit by proponents of nuclear winter, with the fire potentially serving as an opportunity to do some basic measurements of the optical properties of the smoke and smoke-to-fuel ratio, which would have helped refine the estimates of these critical model inputs, the proponents did not indicate that any such measurements were made. Peter V. Hobbs, who would later successfully attain funding to fly into and sample the smoke clouds from the Kuwait oil fires in 1991, {{also expressed}} <b>frustration</b> <b>that</b> he was denied funding to sample the Canadian, and other forest fires in this way. Turco wrote a 10-page memorandum with information derived from his notes and some satellite images, claiming that the smoke plume reached 6km in altitude.|$|E
25|$|He {{turns his}} {{attention}} to astrology, which he criticizes for stereotyping without evidence.

25|$|An {{inability}} to locate abducted children taken to Mexico remains {{the single largest}} <b>frustration</b> <b>that</b> left-behind parents face.

25|$|Maeno's suicide flight {{inspired}} {{a variety of}} reactions in Japan. According to an Associated Press article, many Japanese felt some sympathy with Maeno's actions because of the shame associated with the Lockheed scandal. The scandal had shown an unsavory side of Japanese politics to the world, {{and there was a}} sense of <b>frustration</b> <b>that</b> the high-ranking politicians who had dealt with Kodama would never be revealed or brought to justice.|$|E
25|$|Nolan {{accepted}} the pass as real but his writings show his <b>frustration</b> <b>that</b> Parker was competing {{for his own}} mission. Cooper wrote that Nolan swore and let loose {{a long series of}} invective frustration at everyone who seemed to be against 'his' mission. It took him a while to calm down. He then asked Parker questions where the Comanche raiders were and where they were headed. Parker glanced toward one direction and pointed off in a different direction while Tafoya translated. Parker never used English with Nolan even though he spoke it well.|$|E
25|$|International Transgender Day of Visibility is {{an annual}} holiday {{occurring}} on March 31 dedicated to celebrating transgender people and raising awareness of discrimination faced by transgender people worldwide. The holiday {{was founded by}} Michigan-based transgender activist Rachel Crandall in 2009 {{as a reaction to}} the lack of LGBT holidays celebrating transgender people, citing the <b>frustration</b> <b>that</b> the only well-known transgender-centered holiday was the Transgender Day of Remembrance which mourned the loss of transgender people to hate crimes, but did not acknowledge and celebrate living members of the transgender community.|$|E
5000|$|Herod’s {{death in}} 4 B.C.E. caused {{the release of}} built up frustrations {{of the people who}} were {{suppressed}} by his brutality. Many people were impoverished because of Herod’s high taxes and spendings. When he died, his building projects that once allowed for job opportunities were stopped, and many people lost their jobs.

50|$|Gonzales left Blind after {{experiencing}} <b>frustrations</b> <b>that</b> {{were similar}} to his time with Vision and then started another company called ATM Click.

50|$|Along {{with the}} surrealist humor of seeing alien races act just like humans, the strip {{simultaneously}} presents an observational brand of humor. Abe and Preston often are depicted {{going through the}} same <b>frustrations</b> <b>that</b> real-life modern-day New Yorkers encounter as they try to do such things as rent apartments, eat out at restaurants, and ride the subway. Transformers screenwriter John Rogers has compared ALP to Seinfeld in this respect.|$|R
25|$|The Tehran Conference in late 1943 was {{the first}} Allied conference in which Stalin was present. At the conference the Soviets {{expressed}} <b>frustration</b> <b>that</b> the Western Allies had not yet opened a second front against Germany in Western Europe. In Tehran, the Allies also considered the political status of Iran. At the time, the British had occupied southern Iran, while the Soviets had occupied an area of northern Iran bordering the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. Nevertheless, {{at the end of}} the war, tensions emerged over the timing of the pull out of both sides from the oil-rich region.|$|E
25|$|Van Zyl {{took the}} voice {{recorder}} to the National Transportation Safety Board in Washington, DC, {{to show his}} goodwill and to ensure neutral observers. Van Zyl believes that if he kept the CVR in South Africa {{he could have been}} accused of covering up the truth. At the NTSB, Van Zyl felt <b>frustration</b> <b>that</b> the degraded CVR, which had been in the deep ocean for fourteen months, did not initially yield any useful information. Around 28 minutes into the recording the CVR indicated that the fire alarm sounded. Fourteen seconds after the fire alarm, the circuit breakers began to pop. Investigators believe that around 80 circuit breakers failed. The CVR cable failed 81 seconds after the alarm. The recording revealed the extent of the fire.|$|E
25|$|Young Henry {{fell out}} with his father in 1173. Contemporary chroniclers allege that this was owing to the young man's <b>frustration</b> <b>that</b> his father had given him no realm to rule, and his feeling starved of funds. The {{rebellion}} seems, however, to have drawn strength from much deeper discontent with his father's rule, and a formidable party of Anglo-Norman, Norman, Angevin, Poitevin and Breton magnates joined him. The revolt of 1173–1174 came close to toppling the king; he was narrowly saved by the loyalty of a party of nobles with holdings on the English side of the Channel, and by the defeat and capture of William I, the King of Scotland. Young Henry sought a reconciliation after the capture of his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, {{and the failure of}} the rebellion. His funds were much increased by the terms of the settlement, and he apparently devoted most of the next seven years to the amusement of the tournament.|$|E
