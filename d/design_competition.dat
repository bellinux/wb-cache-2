5|$|The cathedral's architect, Frederick Gibberd, was {{the winner}} of a {{worldwide}} <b>design</b> <b>competition.</b> Construction began in 1962 and was completed in 1967. Earlier designs for a cathedral were proposed in 1853, 1933, and 1953, but none were completed.|$|E
5|$|There were 95 {{entries for}} the {{competition}} {{from around the}} world, whittled down to a shortlist of six. The winner of the <b>design</b> <b>competition,</b> Levitate Architecture and Design Studio Ltd, was announced in March 2008. The winning design included a dozen luxury apartments and a 50-room hotel.|$|E
5|$|A <b>design</b> <b>competition</b> was {{announced}} in July 1911, but there were not many contenders. The Naval Ministry favored the design from the Russud Works and gave preliminary orders for three ships on 2 September, even before the competition was concluded in November. Russud's design was unsurprisingly selected and the government transferred designers from the government-owned Baltic Works {{as well as a}} complete set of drawings for the Gangut-class to speed up the detailed design process.|$|E
40|$|First <b>design</b> <b>competitions</b> {{were searching}} for the “aesthetically beautiful” designs, {{schematics}} or drawings. That was the purpose. <b>Design</b> <b>competitions</b> have evolved. They are no longer just beauty competitions. As digital platforms advanced, <b>design</b> <b>competitions</b> have become something more. The rules have changed and the transformation {{is so great that}} once secondary aims, or externalities, out of the box thinking, innovative collobration, outsourcing design, subsidizing design or brand communication have become primary aims. <b>Design</b> <b>competitions</b> also grew in size, from sketches to protoypes to just ideas to complex product/service systems, and shifted in a direction to be more “multi-disciplinary” than ever. New aims such as community building, customer base formation, database building, co-branding with designers, recruiting of employees, money making, creating standards, social working, brainpower collection, trend identification and research have come to be. Many companies and platforms have appeared which exploit this new phenomenon. All these advancements are happenning out of academic sphere. Papers and discussions regarding <b>design</b> <b>competitions</b> date from 1970 s are no longer valid, as they are from pre-internet periods, almost always about “architectural” competitions. This new phenomenon and transformation about <b>design</b> <b>competitions</b> is worth being investigated in a scientific approach. Because the <b>design</b> <b>competitions</b> are just too important for a “laissez-faire” kind of approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of contemporary <b>design</b> <b>competitions</b> has been increasingly recognized in fast-growing China {{in the course}} of World Trade Organization (WTO) integration and globalization. However, scientific and systematic analysis is rare on how international <b>design</b> <b>competitions</b> are introduced, and how they interact and transplant in the Chinese context. The well-known Chinese-Western culture gap and complicated social and political background make this topic more challenging. Herein, the authors focus on how the international <b>design</b> <b>competitions</b> were “translated” into both international and local perspectives with a compara­tive analysis on development of international <b>design</b> <b>competitions</b> between the Chinese and the Finnish model. To fully exemplify the design-completion procedure and the different roles of Chinese stakeholders and their perspectives on <b>design</b> <b>competitions,</b> the authors study the Baietan case, which was chosen due to its specific relationship with the city’s strategic plan, its representativeness in using international <b>design</b> <b>competitions</b> in connection to large-scale urban projects in China and its public access to the relevant documentation. The preliminary findings suggest that Chinese-style <b>design</b> <b>competitions,</b> acting as ‘designed trading zones’, with less-defined competition rules compared to the Finnish model, may foster the settings of local transformation in adopting international urban planning and design knowledge. However, an integrated approach is required to address subsequent implementation. </p...|$|R
50|$|Landscape {{architecture}} competitions {{are structured}} similarly to {{other types of}} <b>design</b> <b>competitions</b> (architecture, industrial <b>design,</b> graphic design etc.). In the case of landscape architecture <b>design</b> <b>competitions,</b> the procedure is sponsored by an organization or client that intends on implementing a new landscape design to a property in their care or ownership. Just as in architectural <b>design</b> <b>competitions,</b> the winning <b>design</b> is usually selected by an independent jury composed of design professionals and stakeholders such as government and/or local representatives. In general, <b>design</b> <b>competitions</b> are often used to stimulate new ideas in design, generate public debate, serve {{as a form of}} public relations for the project in question and integrate emerging designers into a more level field of competition.|$|R
5|$|A new {{central library}} was {{discussed}} by library administrators {{for several decades}} {{and approved by the}} regional council in 2008.

5|$|Stalinist {{officials}} allocated no {{funding for}} the <b>design</b> <b>competition</b> nor for the memorial, and the committee disbanded in 1948; by then many survivors had left the country. In 1949, the town of Sokołów Podlaski protected the camp with a new fence and gate. A work crew with no archaeological experience was sent in to landscape the grounds. In 1958, {{after the end of}} Stalinism in Poland, the Warsaw provincial council declared Treblinka to be a place of martyrology. Over the next four years, 127 hectares (318 acres) of land that had formed part of the camp was purchased from 192 farmers in the villages of Prostyń, Grądy, Wólka Okrąglik and Nowa Maliszewa.|$|E
5|$|The Platt-LePage XR-1, {{also known}} by the company {{designation}} PL-3, was an early American twin-rotor helicopter, built by the Platt-LePage Aircraft Company of Eddystone, Pennsylvania. The winner of a United States Army Air Corps <b>design</b> <b>competition</b> held in early 1940, the XR-1 was the first helicopter tested by the USAAF, flying in 1941. The flight testing of the XR-1 proved troublesome, and although continued testing showed that the design had promise, other, improved helicopters were becoming available before the XR-1 was ready for service. As a result, {{the development of the}} aircraft was terminated in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} de Saulles in 1903 {{had led to}} the {{abolition}} of the post of Engraver, and coins for George V, who took the throne on Edward's death in 1910, were subject to a <b>design</b> <b>competition</b> won by Bertram Mackennal, who also prepared the medal for the Coronation. The King apparently liked his work, as he was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order in 1911 and knighted in 1921. The inscription around the left-facing bust reads GEORGIVS V DEI GRA BRITT OMN REX FID DEF IND IMP, while no significant change was made to the reverse design. The new bronze coins were made current by proclamation dated 28 November 1910, effective 1 January 1911.|$|E

5|$|The {{sculpture}} was {{the result}} of a <b>design</b> <b>competition.</b> After Kapoor's design was chosen, numerous technological concerns regarding the design's construction and assembly arose, in addition to concerns regarding the sculpture's upkeep and maintenance. Various experts were consulted, some of whom believed the design could not be implemented. Eventually, a feasible method was found, but the sculpture's construction fell behind schedule. It was unveiled in an incomplete form during the Millennium Park grand opening celebration in 2004, before being concealed again while it was completed. Cloud Gate was formally dedicated on May 15, 2006, and has since gained considerable popularity, both domestically and internationally.|$|E
