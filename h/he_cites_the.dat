5|$|Harvey Greenberg {{presents}} a Freudian reading in his The Movies on Your Mind, {{in which the}} transgressions which prevent Rick from returning to the United States constitute an Oedipus complex, which is resolved only when Rick begins {{to identify with the}} father figure of Laszlo and the cause which he represents. Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive and that {{the most important aspect of}} the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; <b>he</b> <b>cites</b> <b>the</b> different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick and boss) as evidence of the different meanings which he has for each person.|$|E

5|$|Uematsu left Square Enix in 2004 {{and formed}} his own {{production}} company, Smile Please. He later founded the music production company and record label Dog Ear Records in 2006.

Also, <b>he</b> <b>cites</b> <b>the</b> fact that he had reached an age where he should gradually take his life into his own hands.

25|$|The Mismeasure of Man {{presents}} a historical {{evaluation of the}} concepts of the intelligence quotient (IQ) and of the general intelligence factor (g factor), which were and are the measures for intelligence used by psychologists. Gould proposed that most psychological studies have been heavily biased, by {{the belief that the}} human behavior of a race of people is best explained by genetic heredity. <b>He</b> <b>cites</b> <b>the</b> Burt Affair, about the oft-cited twin studies, by Cyril Burt (1883–1971), wherein Burt claimed that human intelligence is highly heritable.|$|E
25|$|Kovel {{is quick}} to assert that the focus on “production” {{does not mean that}} there will be an {{increase}} in production and labor under Eco-socialism.

25|$|First, {{he points}} to {{economic}} freedom. One of the common threads of logic in aid is that countries need to develop economically in order to rise from poverty.

However, Sachs contends that Easterly, and many other neo-Liberal economists believe high levels of economic freedom in these emerging markets is almost a necessity to development. Sachs himself does not believe this. <b>He</b> <b>cites</b> <b>the</b> lack of correlation between the average degrees of Economic Freedom in countries and their yearly GDP growth, which in his data set is completely inconclusive.|$|E

25|$|His speech, {{usually called}} Pro restaurandis (or instaurandis) scholis (For the {{restoration}} of the schools), was probably delivered in 297 CE or 298 CE in the forum at Augustodunum or Lugdunum (modern day Lyon before the governor of the province. The purpose was to ask the governor if Eumenius may dedicate his salary (or a large part of it) to rebuild the schools at Autun. He praises the emperors (Constantius Chlorus and his colleagues of the tetrarchy) and sets forth the steps necessary to restore the schools to their former state of efficiency, stressing that he intends to assist the good work out of his own pocket. <b>He</b> <b>cites</b> <b>the</b> imperial letter of Constantius granting him his position and salary at length, and it is from the address of that letter that the name of the oration's author is preserved.|$|E

In his complaint, Major Carter contends that the Air Force has known since 1994 that the aircraft were contaminated with the defoliant; <b>he</b> <b>cites</b> <b>the</b> fact that when a former C-123 was being prepared for a permanent static display that workers had to use HAZMAT suits and respirators. Additionally, it is asserted that when the aircraft was tested by the Air Force, it contained high levels of the known carcinogen polychlorinated dibenzodioxin, studies since confirmed by the Oregon Health Sciences University and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.|$|E
500|$|Likewise, medical {{historian}} W. T. W.
