"Blood Ties" [...] {{featured}} the first appearances of Peter Gerety, Jon Seda and Callie Thorne as regular cast members on [...] Thorne portrayed Laura Ballard, a former Seattle homicide unit detective, marking the character's {{first appearance in}} the series. Gerety and Seda each previously played their respective characters in guest appearances on the show; Seda's character Paul Falsone {{first appeared in the}} two-part [...] finale. Stuart Gharty, Gerety's character, is described as a transplant from the department's internal affairs department. Executive producer Tom Fontana said he thought the new cast additions would create drama and tension between the characters: [...] "It's stimulating to add new people, because you're not feeling like you're writing or acting the same scene for the thousandth time, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> three of them are very different than any other characters we've had on the show." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Hankinson, [...] "One of {{the best}} parts of the episode {{centered}} around Brittany and Santana, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> the principals—Artie, Finn, Rachel, and Quinn too—did a great job portraying the tension and distrust pervading the team." [...] Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times felt the show was [...] "absurdly preachy" [...] on the matter of rumors, though he said the episode was [...] "decent". The scene in the motel room with Sam, Rachel, Finn and Sam's brother and sister was called [...] "arguably the most affecting scene of the entire episode" [...] by Handlen, and Poniewozik wrote that [...] "Chord Overstreet sold Sam's feeling of loss". Canning felt otherwise: [...] "It may have had a better impact if we cared more about Sam or if Chord Overstreet had delivered more believable tears, but as things were, it was just some ordinary, blah drama." ...|$|E

We hated going back to Hamburg those last two times. We'd had that scene. Brian [...] made us go back to fulfill the contract...". Harrison had positive memories of the period: [...] "I'd have to say with hindsight that Hamburg bordered on the best of Beatles times. We didn't have any luxury, we didn't have any bathrooms or any clothes, we were pretty grubby, we couldn't afford anything, {{but on the other}} hand we weren't yet famous, so we didn't have to contend with the bullshit that comes with fame." [...] McCartney was philosophical: [...] "Hamburg was certainly a great childhood memory. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> things are enhanced by time. It was very exciting, though I think it felt better to me a little later in our career, once we'd started to get a bit of success with the records." ...|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "All Hands on the Bad One" [...] {{features}} guitar riffs {{that are}} reminiscent of the band's second album, Call the Doctor. It {{was chosen as the}} title track because, according to guitarist Carrie Brownstein, it is the song that best represents the sentiment of the album. Brownstein explained that the song deals with [...] "your relationship to evil and your relationship to the hypocrisy of forcing a morality on someone else when you yourself are no better." [...] She added, [...] "'Ballad of the Ladyman', for instance—who is 'the ladyman'? Is the person that wants to be on the radio, 'the bad one,' or is it the fans assuming that they [...] {{want to be on the}} radio—are they 'the bad one'? Or is 'The Professional,' the ominous professional figure, 'the bad one'? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> these songs can go into that machine of 'the bad one' and that mentality and then be spit out in a bunch of different scenarios. So that's why I think it works as the title." ...|$|E

[...] Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford commented: [...] "They were and still are a groundbreaking band..you can put on the first Black Sabbath album and it still sounds as fresh today as it did 30-odd years ago. And that's because great music has a timeless ability: To me, Sabbath {{are in the same}} league as the Beatles or Mozart. They're on the leading edge of something extraordinary." [...] On Black Sabbath's standing, Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello states: [...] "The heaviest, scariest, coolest riffs and the apocalyptic Ozzy wail are without peer. You can hear the despair and menace of the working-class Birmingham streets they came from in every kick-ass, evil groove. Their arrival ground hippy, flower-power psychedelia to a pulp and set the standard for all heavy bands to come." [...] Phil Anselmo of Pantera and Down stated that [...] "Only a fool would leave out what Black Sabbath brought to the heavy metal genre".|$|E

500|$|As {{noted by}} {{interviewer}} Kurt Wolff, [...] "the melody and overall {{sound of the}} song also stand out as something fresh and very different." [...] Tompkins explained to Wolff that [...] "Blown Away" [...] was an [...] "attempt at 'melodic pop' that was 'unique' yet still 'country.'" [...] Tompkins also commented that [...] "Blown Away" [...] is [...] "not even mine and Josh’s song anymore; it's [...] song now. She's completely claimed it. The song is Carrie. It's not even a song that had a chance of being pitched to anybody else. It's a completely different type of song for Carrie. She's {{got a lot of}} pop elements, and I listen to a lot of pop, but I listen to everything from Randy Newman to Mozart to Rihanna to Steely Dan. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>all</b> that stuff shows up in my music, and I think it showed up in 'Blown Away.'" [...] The final version of the song was produced by Mark Bright, who drew inspiration from 1980s music. Underwood recalled Bright adding an effect to her vocals similar to the ones used in Def Leppard songs: [...] "That was a big thing with , all of that hollow vocal sound. And I liked it." [...] Bright used a similar effect on [...] "See You Again", another song from Blown Away. Melodically, [...] "Blown Away" [...] is written in the key of A minor, and is set in the common time with a tempo of 134 beats per minute. The song follows the sequence of Am - C - G as its chord progression, and Underwood's voice spans from the low note of G3 to the high note of E5.|$|E

In response to questions by The Times about his 1973 statement, Huhne responded: [...] "To be honest I don't have any memory of it", saying that he was entitled to a private life before politics. In an interview published on the Kent News website on 10 November 2007, Huhne said: [...] "I clearly regret the views and I don't agree with those views at all.

[...] But the US, Britain and France subsequently ignored the proposal.
