5000|$|Another common {{stereotype}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> {{want to be}} [...] "the world's policemen", {{believing that}} the entire world needs their help - even if this results in preemptive military intervention - because someone or something makes them inherently exceptional. This relatively recent stereotype spawned from Cold War and post-Cold War military interventions such as the Vietnam War and Iraq War, which many people opposed.|$|E

50|$|This law's effect <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> in {{the colonies}} were forced to buy British-made goods, and this {{artificial}} trade restraint meant <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> paid {{four times as much}} for hats and cloth imported from Britain than for local goods. It was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1867.|$|R
5000|$|I {{think the}} only way to change the {{dialogue}} on complementary and alternative medicine - what we call CAM - is to have a serious person here at the N.I.H., doing serious work, with serious funding. The fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> are using complementary and alternative therapies. If the public is spending billions of dollars on these things, they are either deluded en masse, or there is some communal wisdom they are expressing. I believe that the tools of science can provide very powerful answers on what they are doing.|$|E
5000|$|One {{explanation}} {{for use of}} the term is that while the American public rebels at terms like [...] "king" [...] and [...] "dictator", associating them with King George III or fascist figures of World War II, the term [...] "czar" [...] is foreign, distant, and exotic enough to be acceptable. [...] And the fact that czar positions are often created in times of perceived public crisis makes the public eager to see a strong figure making hard decisions that the existing political structure is unable to do. [...] Another <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> of the era generally adopted exotic Asian words to denote those with great, and perhaps unchecked, power, with [...] "mogul" [...] and [...] "tycoon" [...] being instances in business contexts.|$|E
5000|$|While on the vice-presidential {{campaign}} trail in Chattanooga, Tennessee, {{he was quoted}} as saying:The truth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> born in this great tradition of humanism, still yield to prejudice and practice discrimination against other Americans. The truth is, having developed patterns and ways of living which reflect these shortcomings and weaknesses, we find it burdensome and difficult to and all too often unacceptable to do the uncomfortable things that we all must do to right the wrongs of our society.While in Chattanooga, the shooting of two black students at Jackson State College by the Mississippi State Police (Jackson State killings), prompted Muskie to hire a jet airliner to take approximately one hundred people to see the bullet holes and attend a funeral {{of one of the}} victims. The people of Maine said this was [...] "rash and self serving" [...] but Muskie has stated his lack of regret for his actions publicly. At an event in Los Angeles, he publicly stated his support for several black empowerment movements in California, which garnered the attention of numerous media outlets, and black city councilman Thomas Bradley. In 1970, the Maine senator was chosen to articulate the Democratic party's message to congressional voters before the midterm elections. Muskie's national stature was raised as a major candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972. In 1973, he gave the Democratic response to Nixon's State of the Union address.|$|E
5000|$|Day is {{also known}} as the {{originator}} of the [...] "Von Braun Paradigm" [...] theory. The theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>American</b> space policy has for decades followed a pattern largely established by von Braun {{in a series of articles}} published in the 1950s in Collier's magazine. The simplified theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>American</b> space leaders have sought to develop space capabilities in a series of steps: develop a space shuttle to construct and service a space station which is then used to establish a lunar base, ultimately leading to a human mission to Mars. The theory has been discussed in books and papers by space historians Howard McCurdy, Roger Launius, and Michael Neufeld.|$|R
50|$|Its {{claim to}} partial fame <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>American</b> film director, screenwriter, producer, actor, and film music {{composer}} John Carpenter {{was born here}} when his mother was visiting her sister. Mr. Carpenter was married to actress Adrienne Barbeau.|$|R

5000|$|After serving {{for five}} years as dean of the {{graduate}} school of psychology at the New College of California (now defunct) in San Francisco, Lerner and his then-wife Nan Fink created a general-interest intellectual magazine called Tikkun: A Bimonthly Jewish Critique of Politics, Culture and Society. Tikkun was started with the intention of challenging the left for its inability to understand the centrality of religious and spiritual concerns in the lives of ordinary Americans. With his associate editor Peter Gabel, Lerner developed a [...] "politics of meaning" [...] (that <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> hunger not only for material security but also for a life that is connected to some higher meaning, and that the failure of the liberal and progressive movements to win a consistent majority support was based on their inability to understand this hunger and to address it by showing Americans and middle income working people in other advanced industrial societies that it was the values of the competitive marketplace and its Bottom Line of money and power that is the fundamental source undermining ethical and spiritual values in the public sphere and then undermining friendships and marriages when these values are brought home into personal life [...] ). This was intended to speak to the hunger for meaning that was characteristic of the thousands of people that Lerner and his colleagues were studying at the Institute for Labor and Mental Health. Tikkun was formed to educate the public about the findings of the Institute and to develop some of the implications of that work. However, because it also had an interest in being an [...] "alternative to the voices of Jewish conservatism," [...] Tikkun was criticized by some Jewish groups.|$|E
40|$|In {{the realm}} of {{interpersonal}} interactions, there are many pieces of conventional wisdom that dictate how most Americans ought to behave. One such example of this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> ought to “do good” in the world. This could mean simply acting kindly to others, but more often it is meant as taking explicit action to promote positive change in the world. Another social norm <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Americans,</b> particularly Iowans and other Midwesterners 1, ought to “avoid causing offense. ” It {{is not difficult to}} see how these two norms sometimes collide, since positive change often entails the transformation of social norms that some deeply value. In this paper, I will examine the question of whether “doing good” in the sense of social activism may sometimes necessarily entail offense. I will argue that it is indeed the case that social activism and causing offense are typically linked, and more importantly, that a deeper understanding of this conflict of norms will provide a framework to guide those who wish to engage in social justice activism...|$|E
40|$|Many {{times when}} people from Europe or other non-baseball playing {{countries}} have commented how strange it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> love baseball while "the {{rest of the}} world plays soccer," I have tried to explain that many countries play baseball. After listing off the countries where baseball is popular, I usually conclude by telling people that the country with the best baseball in the world is not the U. S., but the Dominican Republic...|$|E
5000|$|The central {{holding of}} {{realignment}} theory, first {{developed in the}} political scientist V. O.

40|$|The gender {{activists who}} fill {{our schools and}} {{government}} agencies will continue with their efforts to make boys more docile and emotional. But fewer and fewer Americans will support them. Maleness is back in fashion.

30|$|Another way of {{interpreting}} higher investiture among Japanese subjects <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> were perceived by Japanese as comparatively more accepting and supportive than Japanese were by Americans. Such acceptance and support, i.e., the defining characteristics of investiture, {{may have been}} related to the more thorough exposure that Americans generally had {{in their daily lives}} to Japanese people and culture than the Japanese subjects had to Americans, as well as American subjects’ deeper outgroup acculturation (in terms of prevalently adopting Integration or Assimilation strategies).|$|E
40|$|American workweeks {{are long}} {{compared}} to other rich countries'. Much less well-known <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> {{are more likely to}} work at night and on weekends. We examine the relationship between these two phenomena using the American Time Use Survey and time-diary data from 5 other countries. Adjusting for demographic differences, Americans' incidence of night and weekend work would drop by about 10 percent if European workweeks prevailed. Even if no Americans worked long hours, the incidence of unusual work times in the U. S. would far exceed those in continental Europe...|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> work {{longer hours}} than Germans and other Europeans but when time in household production is included, overall working time {{is very similar}} {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. Americans spend more time on market work but German invest more in household production. This paper examines whether these differences in the allocation of time can be explained by differences in the incentive structure, this is by the taxwedge and differences in the wage differentials, as economic theory suggests. Its analysis of unique time-use data reveals that the differences in time-allocation patterns can indeed be explained by economic variables...|$|E

40|$|Accolades to Susan Dudley for {{organizing}} a symposium around {{the history of}} OIRA. My experience <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> have a disdain for history {{so it will be}} difficult for affected parties to take an interest in the subject matter but it is worth the effort. Why is the history of OIRA important? An understanding of OIRA’s history gives an insight into the regulatory oversight actions that have worked and those that have failed. I am struck by how little knowledge the OIRA career staff has {{of the history of the}} office. This lack of knowledge is not the sole result of the lack of interest on the part of desk officers but also because of the failure of OIRA management in a number of Administrations to address the subject...|$|E
50|$|The general {{consensus}} view appears to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>American</b> literature <b>is</b> not breaking apart because of new genres such as African-American literature.

40|$|Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code {{excludes}} {{from its}} scope any transfer of {{an interest in}} a life insurance policy. Thus, any lender whose security is a life insurance policy may not look to the UCC to determine her rights. This Article argues that the exclusion should be eliminated because it leaves insurance governed by antiquated and problematic law. Three specific problems are considered:non-UCC law {{does not have a}} satisfactory alternative to UCC perfection; non-UCC law is insufficient to prevent lenders from abusively taking more than their share of value from defaulted policies; and non-UCC law allows insurance companies to hinder securitization through the reservation problem. ‖ The result <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> borrow $ 121 billion worth of policy loans, almost all of which comes without serious competition. Eliminating the life insurance exclusion will rationalize the law of lending in this area, and improve prospects for a secondary market...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{striking}} difference in income inequality and redistributive policies between the United States and Scandinavia. To study {{whether there is a}} corresponding cross-country difference in social preferences, we conducted the first large-scale international social preference experiment, with nationally representative samples from the United States and Norway. We introduce a new experimental approach, which combines the infrastructure of an international online market place and the infrastructure of a leading international data collection agency. A novel feature of our experiment <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> and Norwegians make real distributive choices in identical situations where they have complete information about the source of inequality and the cost of redistribution. We show that Americans and Norwegians differ significantly in fairness views, but not in the importance assigned to efficiency. The study also provides robust causal evidence of fairness considerations being much more fundamental for inequality acceptance than efficiency considerations in both countries...|$|E
30|$|To date, {{there exist}} no real {{quantitative}} measures of success {{for a light}} rail system. Paul M. Weyrich and William S. Lind in “Does Transit Work? A Conservative Reappraisal” [21] pointed out one very good reason (among many) for this—light rail never turns a profit. They go on {{to point out that}} no other transportation systems do either (nobody complains that sidewalks don’t turn a profit), but could take it a step farther. Whether or not it is fair for light rail to be held to a profitability standard, the fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> simply are not familiar enough with it to appraise it by other standards. That is, in America “the market” is the fallback standard and often the primary standard. Where nobody can agree on another, it is supposed that the market will sort it out. At the very least, it is supposed that light rail’s benefit/cost ratio should be competitive with roads.|$|E
