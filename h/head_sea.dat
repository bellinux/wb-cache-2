As built, they were wet in a <b>head</b> <b>sea,</b> though this was significantly improved by the installation of a clipper bow in 1940–1941. The ships were highly maneuverable, particularly when the maneuvering setting for the diesel engines was used, in which half of the engines for each shaft were run in reverse. The ships heeled over up to 13degrees with the rudder hard over. The low stern was wet in a stern sea, and equipment stored there was frequently lost overboard.|$|E

5|$|Kaiserin Augusta was {{a unique}} {{protected}} cruiser built for the German Navy in the early 1890s. She was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in 1890, launched in January 1892, and completed in November of that year. Kaiserin Augusta was designed to serve both as a fleet scout and a colonial cruiser due to budgetary limitations. As built, the ship was armed with a main battery of four 15cm K L/30 and eight 10 cm SK L/35 guns, though by 1896 they were replaced with twelve newer 15 cm SK L/35 guns. She was the first ship in the German Navy to feature a three-shaft propeller arrangement. The ship had significant stability problems, shipped excessive quantities of water in a <b>head</b> <b>sea,</b> and maneuvered poorly.|$|E
5|$|The Charlemagne-class ships did not {{function}} {{well in a}} <b>head</b> <b>sea.</b> Stormy weather in the Bay of Biscay in 1900 caused the captain of Gaulois to complain that the ship's forward gun turret and casemates were flooded out and that the ship generated enormous sheets of spray when water came over the bow. Like most French capital ships of the period, they had pronounced tumblehome. Gauloiss captain also said that his ship was a steady gunnery platform and manoeuvered well in tight spaces but he criticized the armour layout as not high enough to prevent munitions from penetrating above the main armour belt and detonating below the secondary armament positions.|$|E

During her sea trials the following month, her sister Courageous sustained structural damage while running at full speed in a rough <b>head</b> <b>sea</b> and had the damaged areas stiffened shortly afterwards to prevent a recurrence. Glorious did not suffer similar damage and did not receive her stiffening until 1918. Upon commissioning, Courageous served with the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet. After most of the 1st Cruiser Squadron was sunk at the Battle of Jutland, the squadron was re-formed with Courageous and Glorious. Glorious received six twin-tube torpedo mounts in mid-1917: one mount {{on each side of the}} mainmast on the upper deck and two mounts on each side of 'Y' turret on the quarterdeck.|$|E

Although contemporary reports suggested that Zephyr and her sister would be allocated to the Australian station, the two ships served their whole career in British waters. Zephyr served in the Portsmouth instructional flotilla until she was paid off at Portsmouth in April 1902, and docked to be strengthened, after she and her sister suffered hull damage below the waterline while being driven into a <b>head</b> <b>sea</b> in heavy weather in the English Channel. Lieutenant George Norman Ballard was appointed in command on 21 June 1902, and she took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII. Two years later, on 18 August 1904 Zephyr was rammed by Torpedo Boat No. 68 in Portsmouth Harbour and holed below the waterline by the torpedo boat's ram, flooding Zephyrs engine room. The torpedo boat was undamaged.Zephyr was involved in another collision on 4 February 1908 when she struck the Cricket-class coastal destroyer TB 2 in Portsmouth harbour, holing TB 2 s hull and forcing her to be docked for repair.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} estimating the spectra of water wave disturbances on {{five of the six}} axes of a stationary, slender body underwater vehicle in an inertia dominated wave force regime, both in <b>head</b> <b>seas</b> and in beam seas. Inertia dominated wave forces are typical of those encountered by a 21 inch diameter, torpedo shaped underwater vehicle operating in coastal waters and sea state 2. Strip theory is used to develop transfer function phase and magnitude between surface water waves and the slender body pitch, heave, and surge forces and moment for the vehicle in <b>head</b> <b>seas,</b> and for pitch, heave, yaw, and sway forces and moments in beam seas. Experiments are conducted which verify this method of transfer function calculation, and demonstrate the effects of vehicle forward motion in the <b>head</b> <b>seas</b> case. Using known sea spectra and linear time invariant systems theory allows for estimation of the water wave disturbance spectra for these forces and moments. Application of sliding control techniques are then developed for the underwater vehicle longitudinal plane equations of motion. Computer simulations are used to demonstrate the dependence of underwater vehicle depth control upon the pitch control, and adaptive pitch control is shown to provide good performance in the presence of substantial parametric uncertainty. Pitch disturbance rejection properties of variations of the sliding controller are investigated. Both single frequency and stochastic disturbances are used, and the stochastic disturbance is developed using the results of the earlier investigation. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The {{onset of}} {{parametric}} rolling in <b>head</b> <b>seas</b> {{has been known}} to cause serious safety issues for ships, particularly containerships. The aim of this work was to investigate the prediction of the occurrence of parametric roll and the factors which influence it. The threshold boundaries, for the inception of parametric roll for a typical containership were established using the Mathieu equation. A series of model experiments was then conducted to validate the theoretical predictions for the inception of parametric roll and investigate the influence of wave height, wave length and GM on the inception of parametric roll. For all the GM values tested reasonable agreement was found between the numerical predictions and the experimental results. A reduction in wave height was found to reduce the range of encounter frequencies for which parametric roll will occur. Parametric roll was found to occur for a range of wavelengths provided that the encounter wave period was in the critical range.

40|$|The {{demand to}} sail at high forward speeds in both calm water {{and in a}} seaway remains high. For various patrol, search and rescue or {{military}} operations attaining high forward speeds is essential. In head and bow quartering seas, the main factor for voluntary speed reduction is the occurrence of large vertical peak accelerations. The occurrence of large vertical peak accelerations imposes limits to the operability of planing monohulls sailing in <b>head</b> <b>seas.</b> A challenge for designers of fast monohulls is to explore different possibilities to increase the operability of planing monohulls sailing in <b>head</b> <b>seas.</b> To achieve this a reduction of the vertical accelerations is required. The operability can be considered improved if the level of accelerations can be reduced compared to a trip at an equal but constant forward speed. This implies {{that it is possible}} to sail at a higher speed without increasing the discomfort on board. A solution for increasing the operability of planing monohulls sailing in <b>head</b> <b>seas</b> has been found in proactive control. Vertical peak accelerations have a very short duration. Unacceptably large vertical peak accelerations have a low frequency of occurrence. These two aspects are the incentive for a proactive control system. What makes proactive control unique is the fact that the control is based on predicted vertical peak accelerations. The response of the ship for the next few seconds needs to be simulated real-time while sailing. These predictions should be carried much faster than real-time, since there is little to effectuate control because of the high relative velocity between ship and incoming waves. In this dissertation proactive control of the forward speed, also termed automated proactive thrust control, has been presented. The purpose of this study is to show the level of reduction of the vertical accelerations possible with automated proactive thrust control.
