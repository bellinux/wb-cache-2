Although not usually {{a factor in the}} thermal radiation of stars, polarization is also present in radiation from coherent astronomical sources (e.g. hydroxyl or methanol masers), and <b>incoherent</b> <b>sources</b> such as the large radio lobes in active galaxies, and pulsar radio radiation (which may, it is speculated, sometimes be coherent), and is also imposed upon starlight by scattering from interstellar dust. Apart from providing information on sources of radiation and scattering, polarization also probes the interstellar magnetic field via Faraday rotation. The polarization of the cosmic microwave background is being used to study the physics of the very early universe. Synchrotron radiation is inherently polarised.

25|$|The {{purpose of}} the latter mask is simply to create {{insensitive}} regions between adjacent pixels, and its use can be avoided if specialized detector technology is employed. In this way, the EI configuration is simultaneously realized for all pixel rows of an area detector. This plurality of individual beamlets means that no scanning is required – the sample is placed downstream of the sample mask and imaged in a single shot (two if phase retrieval is performed). Although the set-up perhaps superficially resembles that of a grating interferometer, the underpinning physical mechanism is different. GI is an intrinsically coherent method, in which an incoherent source can be used only provided it is made sufficiently coherent through collimation via the source grating. In contrast, EI is an incoherent technique, and was in fact proven to work with both spatially and temporally <b>incoherent</b> <b>sources,</b> without any additional source aperturing or collimation. Quantitative phase retrieval was also demonstrated with (uncollimated) <b>incoherent</b> <b>sources,</b> showing {{that in some cases}} results analogous to the synchrotron gold standard can be obtained. The highly simplified set-up, which however does not lead to reduced phase sensitivity, results in a number of advantages, which include reduced exposure time for the same source power, reduced radiation dose, robustness against environmental vibrations, and easier access to high X-ray energy. Moreover, since their aspect ratio is not particularly demanding, masks are cheap, easy to fabricate (e.g.do not require X-ray lithography) and can already be scaled to large areas. The method is easily extended to phase sensitivity in two directions, for example, through the realization of L-shaped apertures for the simultaneous illumination of two orthogonal edges in each detector pixel. More generally, while in its simplest implementation beamlets match individual pixel rows (or pixels), the method is highly flexible, and, for example, sparse detectors and asymmetric masks can be used. So far, the method has been successfully demonstrated in areas such as security scanning, biological imaging, material science, paleontology and others; adaptation to 3D (computed tomography) was also demonstrated. Alongside simple translation for use with conventional x-ray sources, there are substantial benefits in the implementation of EI with coherent synchrotron radiation, among which high performance at very high X-ray energies and angular resolutions higher than in other approaches.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that direct {{observation}} of interference and diffraction pattern in the intensity distribution requires a spatially coherent source. Optical waves emitted from portions beyond the coherence area possess statistically independent phases, and will degrade the interference pattern. In this paper we show an optical interference experiment, which seems contrary to our common knowledge, that the formation of the interference pattern is related to a spatially <b>incoherent</b> light <b>source.</b> Our experimental scheme is very similar to Gabor's original proposal of holography[1], just with an <b>incoherent</b> <b>source</b> replacing the coherent one. In the statistical ensemble of the <b>incoherent</b> <b>source,</b> each sample field produces a sample interference pattern between object wave and reference wave. These patterns completely differ from each other due to the fluctuation of the source field distribution. Surprisingly, the sum of a great number of sample patterns exhibits explicitly an interference pattern, which contains all the information of the object and is equivalent to a hologram in the coherent light case. In this sense our approach would be valuable in holography and other interference techniques for the case where coherent source is unavailable, such as x-ray and electron sources.

We {{examine the}} {{excitation}} transport across quantum networks that are continuously {{driven by a}} constant and <b>incoherent</b> light <b>source.</b> In particular we investigate the coherence properties of incoherently driven networks by employing recent tools from entanglement theory that enable a rigorous interpretation of coherence in the site basis. With these tools at hand we identify coherent delocalization of excitations over several sites to be a crucial prerequisite for highly efficient transport across networks driven by an <b>incoherent</b> <b>source.</b> These results are set into context with the latest discussion of the occurrence and role of coherence in light-harvesting complexes that are exposed to natural incoherent sun light...|$|R

50|$|The Van Cittert-Zernike theorem, {{named after}} {{physicists}} Pieter Hendrik van Cittert and Frits Zernike, is a formula in coherence theory that states that {{under certain conditions}} the Fourier transform of the mutual coherence function of a distant, incoherent source is equal to its complex visibility. This implies that the wavefront from an incoherent source will appear mostly coherent at large distances. Intuitively, this can be understood by considering the wavefronts created by two <b>incoherent</b> <b>sources.</b> If we measure the wavefront immediately {{in front of one}} of the sources, our measurement will be dominated by the nearby source. If we make the same measurement far from the sources, our measurement will no longer be dominated by a single source; both sources will contribute almost equally to the wavefront at large distances.|$|E
