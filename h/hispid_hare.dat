60|$|The country {{gradually}} became quite beautiful, much undulated and diversified by bright green meadows, sloping lawns, and deeply wooded nullahs, which {{lead from the}} Sal forest and meander through this varied landscape. More beautiful sites for fine mansions could not well be, {{and it is difficult}} to suppose so lovely a country should be so malarious as it is before and after the rains, excessive heat probably diffusing widely the miasma from small stagnant surfaces. We noticed a wild hog, absolutely the first wild beast of any size I sawon the plains, except the <b>hispid</b> <b>hare</b> (Lepus hispidus) and the barking deer (Stylocerus ratna). The hare we found to be the best game of this part of India, except the teal. The pheasants of Dorjiling are poor, the deer all but uneatable, and the florican, however dressed, I considered a far from excellent bird.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hispid</b> <b>hare</b> (Caprolagus hispidus), {{also called}} Assam rabbit, is a leporid native to South Asia, whose {{historic}} range extended {{along the southern}} foothills of the Himalayas. Today, the habitat of the <b>hispid</b> <b>hare</b> is highly fragmented with an area of occupancy of less than 500 km2 extending over an estimated area of 5000 to 20000 km2. Populations experience a continuing decline in suitable habitat due to increasing agriculture, flood control, and human development. It is therefore listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1986.|$|E

50|$|The {{historic}} {{range of}} <b>hispid</b> <b>hares</b> extended from Uttar Pradesh through southern Nepal, the northern region of West Bengal to Assam and into Bangladesh.

5000|$|The Dudhwa National Park {{is located}} at India-Nepal border, in Uttar Pradesh in India.

Another reserve area [...] "Kishanpur Pashu Vihar" [...] sanctuary located about 30 km from Dudhwa. spread over about 204 sqr.km, lies {{on the banks of}} river Sharda and is surrounded by Sal forest of adjoining reserve forests. In 1987 Dudhwa National Park and Kishanpur Pashu Vihar were merged to form the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve (DTR). Although the Tigers at the Park are numerous, sightings are rare due to the thick forest cover of the area.
