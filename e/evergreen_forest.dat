The soil is predominantly black, which is suitable for cotton cultivation, but some red loamy soil is also found.

25|$|The {{forest of}} Hoàng Liên National Park can be {{classified}} as belonging to 3 types: sub-montane dry <b>evergreen</b> <b>forest,</b> tropical montane deciduous forest and sub-alpine forest. The sub-montane dry <b>evergreen</b> <b>forest,</b> which occurs at lower altitudes, {{has been the most}} heavily disturbed by the activities of man.|$|E
50|$|Tyrannidae {{specialization}} among {{habitat is}} very strong in tropical lowland <b>evergreen</b> <b>forests</b> and montane <b>evergreen</b> <b>forests.</b> These habitat types therefore display the greatest specialization. The counts differ by three species (tropical lowland <b>evergreen</b> <b>forests</b> have 49 endemic species and montane <b>evergreen</b> <b>forests</b> have 46 endemic species). It can be assumed that they both have similar levels of specialization.|$|R
50|$|The Sri Lanka dry-zone dry <b>{{evergreen}}</b> <b>forests</b> {{are made}} up mostly of evergreen trees, which distinguish them from the deciduous trees that characterize most other tropical dry broadleaf forest ecoregions.

50|$|The Someshwara Wildlife Sanctuary has {{tropical}} wet <b>evergreen</b> <b>forests,</b> west coast semi <b>evergreen</b> <b>forests</b> and southern secondary moist mixed deciduous forests in its ranges.|$|R
25|$|Endemic {{plants on}} the forest include Lobelia deckeniisspsattimae, Helichrysum gloria-dei and Alchemilla hageniae. The forest has four {{vegetation}} zones including subalpine vegetation, xeromorphic <b>evergreen</b> <b>forest,</b> montane humid forest, and submontane forest.|$|E
25|$|The habitat {{consists}} of dry <b>evergreen</b> <b>forest,</b> reed beds, well-wooded forest, open grassland, dry scrub and undergrowth. The main inhabitants here are blackbuck antelope, spotted deer, Indian grey mongoose, golden jackal, monitor lizard, snakes, and over 40 butterfly species.|$|E
25|$|Rhodophyceae. Patches of residual, dry, <b>evergreen</b> <b>forest</b> {{and large}} areas of {{littoral}} scrub in woodlands in fishing villages bordering the lagoon are seen. Invasive phytoplankton species of Prosopis juliflora, Spirulina major, Oscillatoria spp., Anabaena spp., Rhizosolenia castracanei, Eucampia cornuta and Climacodium frauenfeldianum in the plains {{on the periphery of}} the lake have been recorded.|$|E
50|$|Seasonal or dry <b>evergreen</b> <b>forests</b> {{are found}} on about 31 {{percent of the}} area, {{predominantly}} on land lying between 800-1,000 metres elevation. Gallery <b>evergreen</b> <b>forests</b> occur along permanent watercourses, where humidity is high and the soil perpetually moist. They are often categorized under dry <b>evergreen</b> <b>forests,</b> but are particularly important to the sanctuary's fauna.|$|R
5000|$|Coniferous {{temperate}} <b>evergreen</b> <b>forests</b> {{are most}} frequently dominated by species in the families Pinaceae and Cupressaceae. Broadleaf temperate <b>evergreen</b> <b>forests</b> include those in which Fagaceae such as oaks are common, those in which Nothofagaceae predominate, and the Eucalyptus forests of the Southern Hemisphere. There also are assorted temperate <b>evergreen</b> <b>forests</b> dominated by other families of trees, such as Lauraceae in laurel forest.|$|R
5000|$|Also called {{southern}} mixed <b>evergreen</b> <b>forests,</b> {{the mixed}} <b>evergreen</b> <b>forests</b> {{of the southern}} California Coast Ranges, the Transverse Ranges, and the northern Peninsular Ranges, are restricted to cooler north-facing slopes at higher elevations.|$|R
25|$|Flowering acacias {{flourish}} on {{the arid}} Jaffna Peninsula. Among the {{trees of the}} dry-land forests are valuable species such as satinwood, ebony, ironwood, mahogany and teak. The wet zone is a tropical <b>evergreen</b> <b>forest</b> with tall trees, broad foliage, and a dense undergrowth of vines and creepers. Subtropical evergreen forests resembling those of temperate climates flourish in the higher altitudes.|$|E
25|$|The state's {{ecosystems}} {{influenced the}} movement of the semi-nomadic Archaic Indian. The land gradually changed from a tundra to an <b>evergreen</b> <b>forest,</b> and eventually to forests of oak, hemlock, rhododendron, nut, berries, and Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests. The vegetation attracted modern game animals by 7800 BCE. Modern decididuous forests grew south and east of the Allegheny River. Carbonized nut hulls from the St. Albans Site in Kanawha County date to 7000 BCE.|$|E

50|$|Rainfall averages 800 mm/year, {{and mostly}} falls during the highly {{variable}} northeast monsoon between October and December. Unlike {{most of the}} world's tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests, whose trees tend to lose their leaves {{during the dry season}} to conserve moisture, the East Deccan dry <b>evergreen</b> <b>forests</b> retain their leaves year round. Only two other ecoregions exhibit a similar pattern, the Sri Lanka dry-zone dry <b>evergreen</b> <b>forests</b> and the Southeastern Indochina dry <b>evergreen</b> <b>forests.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mixed <b>evergreen</b> <b>forests</b> in the California Coast Ranges vary {{in species}} related to coastal (Outer Ranges) or inland (Inner Ranges) climate influences.

25|$|A {{total of}} 114 mammal {{species have been}} {{recorded}} in the park including Elephant, Hippopotamus and Sitatunga. A number of species have been reintroduced in the park by Kasanka Trust - the most successful of which are Zebra and Buffalo. Close to ten million Eidolon helvum (African fruit bat) migrate to the Mushitu swamp <b>evergreen</b> <b>forest</b> in the park for three months during October to December, making it the largest mammal migration in the world. Over 471 bird species {{have been identified in}} the park.|$|E
25|$|Evergreen {{forests of}} three kinds occur within Kasanka; Mushitu or swamp forest, {{riverine}} forests and very small patches of Mateshe (dry <b>evergreen</b> <b>forest).</b> The Mushitu is characterised by huge red mahoganies, waterberries and quinine trees among others and is fairly well represented. The largest tract of intact Mushitu, in the Fibwe area, hosts the annual gathering of straw-coloured fruit bats from October to December {{making it the}} largest fruit bat roost on Earth. Riverine forests are found along most rivers in Kasanka, with the largest stretches being found along the Luwombwa. True Mateshe probably was common in historic times but is rare now, {{as a result of}} centuries of frequent fires. All forest types are at risk from frequent wildfires as the tree species they support are not resistant to fire.|$|E
25|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the hills}} is typical of high hills. Inside the fort at the summit, many of the large trees are planted exotics such as Eucalyptus and the undergrowth consists of Coffea arabica along with some native species. The forest acts as a substrate for cloud condensation and every morning the trees are covered in water. This allows for many moist forest species of plants and animals. The hills are very rich in birdlife making it a very popular location for birdwatchers and bird photographers. The <b>evergreen</b> <b>forest</b> patch {{on top of the}} hill being a favoured wintering location for many migrant species of warblers, flycatchers and thrushes. The forest patch is also home for a relict population of the Nilgiri woodpigeon. A breeding pair of shaheen falcon, the resident race of the peregrine falcon is also often seen at the Nandi Hills. The Malabar whistling thrush, Uropeltid snakes and pill millipedes which are otherwise known only from the Western Ghats ranges are also found here.|$|E

Near the northern terminus, there are even some tamarack (larch), a coniferous, pine-needled deciduous tree, which provides displays of yellow in the late fall after the birches and maples have gone bare. The hemlocks in Maine are also notable, as the woolly adelgid, which has ravaged populations further south, has not come into the state yet, and may be unable to make it so far north due to the cold climate.|$|E

He cited the scene in which Shawn and Gus are trapped by the criminals {{as an example of}} why the episode was the funniest to him. However, Keller also had a few complaints with the installment. He criticized the episode's beginning, where [...] "a seemingly large <b>evergreen</b> <b>forest</b> looming" [...] can be seen, saying that it ruined the illusion of the show taking place in Santa Barbara. He stated that [...] "the whole thing seemed a little bit incomplete" [...] {{due to the lack of}} a complete [...] "psychic reveal" [...] at the end of the episode, and that the reduced use of Corbin Bernsen in the installment was an issue.|$|E
