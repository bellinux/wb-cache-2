25|$|Driving {{through the}} mist, David finds his house {{destroyed}} {{and his wife}} dead. Devastated, he drives the group south, passing destroyed vehicles and seeing a gigantic six-legged, tentacled beast. When they run out of gas, the group decides {{there is no point}} in going on. David shoots the others (with their consent, except for his son who is not old enough to understand) rather than have them endure horrifying deaths. When David is done killing all of them, he is left with no bullet to use on himself. He leaves the car and waits to be killed, but the mist suddenly recedes, revealing that the U.S. Army has arrived, managed to close the portal, and are in the process of exterminating the creatures. David also witnesses rescued survivors, and restoring order. Among the survivors is the woman who left the store at the phenomenon's onset, completely unscathed and having rescued her two children. David realizes that his group was only moments away from being rescued, aware now that their deaths were premature and in vain, and <b>drops</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> screaming.|$|E
2500|$|To block balls that {{a pitcher}} throws on a bounce toward home plate (pitches that {{are said to}} be [...] "in the dirt"), the catcher will slide his body to the left or right, as necessary, to place himself {{directly}} {{in the path of the}} ball. Once in position, he <b>drops</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> places his mitt between his legs to prevent the ball from passing through, and leans forward to deaden the rebound when, and if, the ball bounces off his thigh or torso. Although inexperienced catchers may try to catch the errant pitch with his mitt, coaches often prioritize the catcher's ability to [...] "keep the ball in front of him" [...] than to make a catch with his mitt. Ideally, the catcher will be able to knock the ball to the ground where it will stop within arm's reach. To perform this properly, without the ball being deflected in an undesirable direction, the catcher must angle his body so that his chest is always leaning forward, toward home plate. This maneuver is often difficult, and its difficulty depends largely on how fast the ball is traveling, the angle at which the ball is thrown into the ground, where it first hits the ground, the firmness of the ground it hits, and the manner in which it is spinning.|$|E
