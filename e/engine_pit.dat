500|$|Nailsea's early economy {{relied on}} coal mining, which began {{as early as}} the 16th century. The {{earliest}} recorded date for coal mining in Nailsea was 1507 when coal was being transported to light fires at Yatton. [...] By the late 1700s the town had a large number of pits. Around this time Nailsea was visited by the social reformer Hannah More who founded a Sunday school for the workers. The Elms Colliery,(Middle <b>Engine</b> <b>Pit),</b> one of the most complete examples of an 18th-century colliery left in England, is now in disrepair. It has been designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage. Remains of the old pits, most of which had closed down by the late 19th century as mining capital migrated to the richer seams of South Wales, are still visible around the town.|$|E

50|$|Big Pit was {{originally}} an iron mine, {{driven into the}} side of the mountain not far from the surface due to the shallow iron deposits, the level is called <b>Engine</b> <b>Pit</b> Level and can still be seen on the bridge connecting Blaenavon and Garn Rd at 51.773998, -3.092075 coordinates. The Iron Workings are above the Big Pit coal workings, for some time <b>Engine</b> <b>Pit</b> Level was used as an emergency exit for Big Pit whilst it was working, now the River Arch Level is the escape route. <b>Engine</b> <b>Pit</b> Level was driven around 1810 by hand due to dynamite being invented 5 decades later, there are no known records of the iron mine, although none that I can find.There are a few pictures online showing the interior of the Engine Level from the 60's when miners from Big Pit explored the level, finding an old flange-less wheel'ed dram inside, now at a museum.

5000|$|New <b>Engine</b> <b>Pit</b> was sunk around 1824 and was {{the only}} one of the Henfield pits that was still {{operational}} after 1867. It had a depth of 502 ft 10ins which at that time was recorded as the deepest shaft sunk in the trough of Coalpit Heath. In the mid-nineteenth century New <b>Engine</b> <b>Pit</b> was the main pit for the Coalpit Heath group of mines. Most coal for this area was drawn from this pit, the other shafts being kept open for pumping and ventilation. On the New <b>Engine</b> <b>Pit</b> site today there are the remains of a horse gin and an engine house, while the area itself is called New Engine. In 1930 it was recorded that there was an 1832 Acraman steam engine at the New Engine colliery site that was being used to drive a saw mill. However, there is no trace of this engine today.|$|E

50|$|Coal mining in Britain, {{particularly}} in South Wales, started early. Before the steam <b>engine,</b> <b>pits</b> were often shallow bell pits following a seam of coal along the surface, which were abandoned as the coal was extracted. In other cases, if the geology was favourable, the coal was mined {{by means of}} an adit or drift mine driven into the side of a hill. Shaft mining was done in some areas, but the limiting factor was the problem of removing water. It could be done by hauling buckets of water up the shaft or to a sough (a tunnel driven into a hill to drain a mine). In either case, the water had to be discharged into a stream or ditch at a level where it could flow away by gravity. The introduction of the steam pump by Savery in 1698 and the Newcomen steam engine in 1712 greatly facilitated the removal of water and enabled shafts to be made deeper, enabling more coal to be extracted. These were developments that had begun before the Industrial Revolution, but the adoption of John Smeaton's improvements to the Newcomen engine followed by James Watt's more efficient steam engines from the 1770s reduced the fuel costs of engines, making mines more profitable.|$|R

40|$|Relevance {{of study}} {{is caused by}} the search for {{effective}} schemes and devices to intensify air exchange of open pits, which is, substantially, worsen with increasing depth of pits and intensity of mining operations. To implement air exchange of pits the scheme of ventilation with simultaneously used device for aeration of pits (DAP) is offered. DAP represents the inclined profiled blades on the support, which are set on the top platform of the pit leeside near the edge (patent-protected useful DAP model) and based on the turbo-propeller aviation <b>engines</b> <b>pit</b> fan (PF) before it. The associated works in the field concerned consider general development factors of free and semi-limited jets, being developed near a flat surface that is different from their development in the conditions of limiting quarry out space with various parameters (overall slope angles, depth, benches at the edges, etc.). The work objective was to study and define the structure and optimal arrangement of PF in respect to DAP and estimate efficiency of using DAP+PF scheme through modelling in a wind tunnel by criterion of average speed of aerial currents in the pit, using a DAP+PF scheme of ventilation. Features of development of aerial currents in pits with various parameters are analysed. Consistent patterns of speed distribution of in semi-limited jet currents are determined. It is proved that the air amount involved in air exchange increases by 8 - 10 times in comparison with the case with one PF used. The offered air exchange scheme of the quarry out space can be used both for an intensification of airing pit, and for its ventilation. The received study results of aerial current aerodynamics can be used in designing air exchange of pits according to the offered scheme. </p...|$|R
