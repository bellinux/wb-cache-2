25|$|The {{peripheral}} terminal of {{the mature}} nociceptor {{is where the}} noxious stimuli are detected and transduced into electrical energy. When the electrical energy reaches a threshold value, an action potential is induced and driven towards {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). This leads to the train of events that allows for the conscious awareness of pain. The sensory specificity of nociceptors is established by the <b>high</b> <b>threshold</b> only to particular features of stimuli. Only when the <b>high</b> <b>threshold</b> has been reached by either chemical, thermal, or mechanical environments are the nociceptors triggered. The majority of nociceptors are classified by which of the environmental modalities they respond to. Some nociceptors respond to more than one of these modalities and are consequently designated polymodal. Other nociceptors respond to none of these modalities (although they may respond to stimulation under conditions of inflammation) and are referred to as sleeping or silent.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} widely {{discussed}} false positives in medical screening come from the breast cancer screening procedure mammography. The US rate of false positive mammograms is up to 15%, the highest in world. One consequence of the high false positive rate in the US is that, in any 10-year period, half of the American women screened receive a false positive mammogram. False positive mammograms are costly, with over $100million spent annually in the U.S. on follow-up testing and treatment. They also cause women unneeded anxiety. As {{a result of the}} high false positive rate in the US, as many as 90–95% of women who get a positive mammogram do not have the condition. The lowest rate in the world is in the Netherlands, 1%.

25|$|Residential {{consumers}} {{outside the}} PRA areas and thus likely {{not to be}} among the poorest, are charged below-cost electricity prices for consumption below 700 kWh/month, a very <b>high</b> <b>threshold</b> by international standards. About 80% of residential users outside the PRA areas fall into this category. This subsidy is drawn from the Tariff Stabilization Fund (FET), which was designed to reduce the impact of high oil prices. The financial burden in this case is transferred to the distribution companies, which have found themselves unable to cover their costs in a scenario of rising oil prices, low efficiency and a limited customer base that could be charged to finance the cross-subsidy. This situation has forced the government to provide much higher than expected subsidies to the sector, which in turn translates into reduced ability to finance investments in other key sectors such as health and education. The government has started to reduce cross-subsidies gradually, with the final objective of limiting them to households with monthly consumption below 200 kWh, which is closer to thresholds for subsidized residential electricity encountered in other countries.|$|E
500|$|Everyone has {{a natural}} set point {{for their ability}} to {{experience}} stress. For some people, this is a very <b>high</b> <b>threshold,</b> whereas other people can become overwhelmed very quickly. [...] Emotional pain activates the same regions of the brain as physical pain, so this can be a significantly intolerable state for some people. Some of this is environmental and some of this is due to physiological differences in responding. The autonomic nervous system is composed of two components: the sympathetic nervous system controls arousal and physical activation (e.g., the fight-or-flight response) and the parasympathetic nervous system controls physical processes that are automatic (e.g., saliva production). The sympathetic nervous system innervates (e.g., is physically connected to and regulates) many parts of the body involved in stress responses. Studies of adolescents have shown that adolescents who self-injure have greater physiological reactivity (e.g., skin conductance) to stress than adolescents who do not self-injure. This stress response persists over time, staying constant or even increasing in self-injuring adolescents, but gradually decreases in adolescents who do not self-injure.|$|E

30|$|For OAS {{based on}} both {{traditional}} and modified greedy seeding, highly accurate link prediction appears essential when thresholds are very low (both in synthetic and real network datasets). In contrast, at <b>higher</b> <b>thresholds,</b> OAS reliably yields significant insight in optimizing seeding, even for high rates of link-prediction error. For OAS where an estimate of V' is found with modified greedy seeding, we observe that in planning full cascades, the stability of (near-) optimized seeding strategies (against noise in link prediction) increases with node <b>thresholds.</b> For <b>high</b> <b>thresholds,</b> a seed set that will truly “go viral” can be found by modified greedy seeding even from a quite-noisy view of the network structure. At lower budgets, where infections spread modestly but do not “go viral,” damage to seeding performance due to noisy link prediction appears immediate: we observe no stability effect. If instead, V' is estimated with traditional greedy seeding, for <b>high</b> <b>thresholds</b> in scale-free networks we observe a modest but remarkably stable OAS advantage even {{at the highest levels}} of link error. For <b>high</b> <b>thresholds</b> in scale-free networks, even a highly noisy view of the network can steer traditional greedy seeding to choose a modestly effective seed set.|$|R

2500|$|C fibers synapse to second-order {{projection}} neurons in {{the spinal}} cord at the upper laminae of the dorsal horn in the substantia gelatinosa. The second-order projection neurons are of the wide dynamic range (WDR) type, which receive input from both nociceptive terminals as well as myelinated A-type fibers. There are three types of second order projection neurons in the spinothalamic tract: wide dynamic range (WDR), <b>high</b> <b>threshold</b> (HT), and low threshold (LT). These classifications are based on their responses to mechanical stimuli. [...] The second-order neurons ascend to the brain stem and thalamus in the ventrolateral, or anterolateral, quadrant of the contralateral half of {{the spinal cord}}, forming the spinothalamic tract. The spinothalamic tract is the main pathway associated with pain and temperature perception, which immediately crosses the spinal cord laterally. This crossover feature is clinically important because it allows for identification of the location of injury.|$|E

[...] If the Parliament and Council have not adopted an identical text after two readings, a Conciliation committee meets to find a compromise, which must be submitted to a third reading in each for final approval.

2500|$|In {{three main}} situations, English law allows people who lack legal {{capacity}} to contract to escape from enforcement of agreements and recover property that was conveyed, to reverse unjust enrichment. First, a person may be {{too young to be}} bound by large or onerous contracts. Minors, under 18 years, can bind themselves to contracts for [...] "necessaries" [...] to pay a reasonable price, but only unusual contracts, such as for eleven luxury waistcoats will not be deemed [...] "necessaries". While the adult contracting party is bound, the minor has the option to rescind the contract, so long as one of the four equitable bars (lapse of time, affirmation, third party rights, counter-restitution possible) is not present. Second, people who are mentally incapacitated, for instance because they are sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983 or they are completely , are in principle bound to agreements when the other person could not or did not know they lacked mental capacity. But if the other person did know or should have known, then the mentally incapacitated individual may no longer have agreements for non-necessaries enforced upon them. Third, companies can generally bind themselves to any agreement, even though many (particularly older) companies have a limited range of objects that their members (in most companies this means shareholders) have consented that the business is for. Under the Companies Act 2006 sections 39 and 40, if a third party contracting with the company in bad faith takes advantage of a director or officer to procure an agreement, that contract will be wholly void. This is a <b>high</b> <b>threshold,</b> and in practice no longer relevant, particularly since 2006 companies may elect to have unrestricted objects. It is more likely that a contract ceases to be enforceable because, as a matter of the law of agency the third party should have reasonably known that the person contracting lacked authority to enter an agreement. In this situation a contract is voidable at the instance of the company, and could only be enforced against the (probably less solvent) employee.|$|E
