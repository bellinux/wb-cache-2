25|$|Headlight {{flashing}} {{might have}} come into more common use {{as a means of}} attempting driver-to-driver communication by the mid-1970s, when cars began to come with <b>headlight</b> <b>beam</b> selectors located on the steering column—typically activated by pulling the turn signal stalk—rather than the previous foot-operated pushbutton switches. The signal stalk configuration was later wired to permit the momentary activation of the high beams regardless of whether the headlamp switch was turned on or off.|$|R

40|$|In {{developing}} countries, night {{driving is}} extremely unsafe mainly due to; 1). Poorly followed traffic rules and 2) bad road conditions. The number of accidents is increasing at a frightening pace, necessitating {{the development of}} a low cost automatic headlight control system to ensure safety. In most accident cases, fatal collisions take place due to glare generated by excessive <b>headlight</b> intensity (high <b>beam)</b> of the oncoming vehicle. In this paper, a user friendly controller for headlight intensity control for driving on highway at night has been proposed. Aim is to design simple and affordable system that can alleviate effect of blind spot due to high glare on the vehicle windscreen. Controller is based on Fuzzy inference system (FIS) and used incoming light intensity as criteria. Also, relative distance and speed is derived using incoming intensity of the oncoming vehicles. The system is designed considering human tolerance levels of light intensity as the boundary values. The system controls <b>headlight</b> <b>beam</b> voltage such that; a) intensity is maintained in human visual comfort zone and b) blind spot is avoided. The super user feature incorporated in the intensity controller offers personalized preferences to the driver. Due {{to the use of the}} single parameter (intensity) for control, system can be implemented using simplified hardware...|$|R
25|$|Headlight {{flashing}} is the act {{of either}} briefly switching on the headlights of a car, or of momentarily switching between a <b>headlight's</b> high <b>beams</b> and low beams, {{in an effort to}} communicate with another driver or drivers. The signal is sometimes referred to in car manufacturers' manuals as an optical horn, since it draws the attention of other drivers.|$|R

40|$|Insufficient roadway sight {{distance}} (SD) {{may become a}} contribution factor to traffic collisions or other unsafe traffic maneuvers. The {{sight distance}} (SD) for a two-dimensional (2 -d) sag or circular curve has been addressed in detail in various traffic engineering literatures. Although three-dimensional (3 -d) compound sag and circular curves are often found along ramps, connectors, and mountain roads, the sight distances for these compound curves are yet to be analyzed on an exact analytic setting. By considering human-vehicle-roadway interaction, the formulas for computing the SD on a 3 -d curve are derived {{the first time on}} a unified analytic framework. The 2 -d sag curve SD can also be deduced from these derived formulas as special limiting cases. Practitioners can easily program these formulas or equations on a user-friendly Microsoft Excel spread sheet to calculate 3 -d SD on most roadways with roadside clearance. This framework can be extended to estimate SD on roadways with obstacles partially blocking vehicle <b>headlight</b> <b>beams.</b> 6...|$|R
40|$|Headlights of {{vehicles}} pose a great danger during night driving. The drivers of most vehicles use high, bright beam while driving at night. This causes a discomfort {{to the person}} travelling from the opposite direction. He experiences a sudden glare {{for a short period}} of time. This is caused due to the high intense <b>headlight</b> <b>beam</b> from the other vehicle coming towards him from the opposite direction. We are expected to dim the headlight to avoid this glare. This glare causes a temporary blindness to a person resulting in road accidents during the night. To avoid such incidents, we have fabricated a prototype of automatic headlight dimmer. This automatically switches the high beam into low beam thus reducing the glare effect by sensing the approaching vehicle. It also eliminates the requirement of manual switching by the driver which is not done at all times. The construction, working and the advantages of this prototype model is discussed in detail in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Drivers' visual {{limitations}} are a leading contributor to night-time traffic crashes involving pedestrians. This paper reviews the basic changes in vision that occur at night for {{young and old}} visually healthy drivers, {{as well as those}} with common ocular pathology. To maximise their safety at night, pedestrians should be conspicuous. That is, beyond being simply visible (detectable as an ambiguous object), they should attract the attention of drivers and be readily perceivable as pedestrians. Research has established that the conspicuity of pedestrians can be optimised by attaching retroreflective markings to the pedestrian's extremities. Doing so highlights the pedestrian's ‘biological motion,’ which facilitates the accurate perception of a person; however, retroreflective markings on the torso (for example, vests) are less effective. Importantly, behavioural evidence indicates that most road users – drivers and pedestrians alike – are not aware of the limitations of night vision. For example, drivers typically ‘overdrive’ the useful range of their <b>headlight</b> <b>beams</b> and under-use their high <b>beam</b> <b>headlight</b> setting. Further, pedestrians overestimate their own conspicuity at night and fail to appreciate the extent to which their own conspicuity depends on their clothing. The widespread misunderstanding of the challenges associated with night driving reflects a lack of awareness of the fundamental limitations of night vision. Educational interventions are needed to ameliorate these dangerous misunderstandings and to improve the safety of all road users at night...|$|R

5000|$|A common {{experience}} while travelling on state highways is being 'flashed' by oncoming vehicles.
