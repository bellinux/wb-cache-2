25|$|In 2001 {{environmental}} studies identified {{areas of the}} outer Thames Estuary as potential sites for offshore wind farm; the Department of Trade and Industry published the paper Future Offshore — A Strategic Framework for the Offshore Wind Industry, which identified the outer Thames Estuary as one of three potential areas for future wind farm development (Round 2 wind farms). The Crown Estate awarded a 50-year lease to London Array Ltd. (a consortium of E.ON UK Renewables, Shell WindEnergy, and CORE Limited.) in December 2003.

Closing to passengers in 1960, a single freight line between Sandbach via Middlewich railway station and Northwich also just enters Bradwall in the northwest, near the <b>electricity</b> <b>substation</b> in Moston.

2500|$|In January 1970, the UVF began bombing Catholic-owned {{businesses}} in Protestant areas of Belfast. It {{issued a statement}} vowing to [...] "remove republican elements from loyalist areas" [...] and stop them [...] "reaping financial benefit therefrom". During 1970, 42 Catholic-owned licensed premises in Protestant areas were bombed. Catholic churches were also attacked. In February it began to target critics of militant loyalism – the homes of MPs Austin Currie, Sheelagh Murnaghan, Richard Ferguson and Anne Dickson were attacked with improvised bombs. It also continued its attacks in the Republic of Ireland, bombing the Dublin-Belfast railway line, an <b>electricity</b> <b>substation,</b> a radio mast, and Irish nationalist monuments.|$|E

40|$|A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) {{with the}} {{potential}} to monitor and locate partial discharge (PD) in high-voltage <b>electricity</b> <b>substations</b> using only received signal strength (RSS) is proposed. The advantages of an RSS-based operating principle over more traditional methods (e. g. Time-of-Arrival and Time-Difference-of-Arrival) are described. Laboratory measurements of PD that emulate the operation of a PD WSN are presented. The hardware architecture of a prototype PD WSN is described and the particular challenge of an RSS-based location approach in an environment with an unknown, and spatially varying, path-loss index are discussed. It is concluded that an RSS-based PD WSN is a plausible solution for the monitoring of insulation integrity in <b>electricity</b> <b>substations...</b>|$|R
2500|$|There is {{one other}} {{confirmed}} bunker, a [...] "Remote Receiving station", in Bankstown. Little is known about its history though it was reportedly [...] "heavily vandalised" [...] in 1945. It was located in Picnic Point National Park, near the South Sydney Power station. According to residents of the area, it still exists. Based on a comparison of contemporary and historic maps, the Receiving Station and the present day Sydney South <b>electricity</b> <b>substation</b> share the same footprint, with the latter apparently situated directly above the former. The substation is bounded on its southwestern and southeastern sides by Henry Lawson Drive, in the Georges River National Park.
