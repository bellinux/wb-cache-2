The Court has competence, among other things, to rule on applications for annulment or actions for failure to act brought by a Member State or an institution, actions against Member States for <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> <b>obligations,</b> references for a preliminary ruling and appeals against decisions of the General Court [...]|$|E

An action for <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> <b>obligations</b> directed against a Member State which has failed to comply with its obligations under European Union law may be brought by the Commission or by another Member State. In the history of European integration only six times one Member State has directly brought infringement proceedings against another State. Of the six cases, only four proceeded to judgment. The European Institutions and the Member States should continue to develop their work to ensure that EU law is correctly applied and implemented...|$|E
40|$|Resumé The thesis named Case Law of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the Area of Environmental Protection {{deals with}} {{three types of}} action in which the {{judicial}} protection of the environmental interests is provided. First the chambers of the Court of Justice of the EU are characterised - the Court of Justice, the General Court and the Civil Service Tribunal. Chapters on particular types of action follow. Each of them is attached with analysed related significant cases that the Court of Justice of the EU adjudicated upon. The first type of action is the action for <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> <b>obligations</b> where the principal questions are possibilities of imposing fines on member states that infringe the EU law. Sanctions are imposed in two forms - a penalty or a lump sum. The second type of action is the reference for a preliminary ruling in which the Court of Justice of the EU interprets the EU law a helps courts of the member states apply the EU law. The final chapter examines the action for annulment in which the fundamental and very disputable question {{is the question of}} right of action in environmental matters. After the comparison with other areas of the EU law, in particular the area of the competition law, it results from the thesis's chapters that the Court of Justice of the EU provides a very [...] ...|$|E

The House of Lords held that Parliament must be presumed to have intended non-resident companies to be liable to the special deduction scheme for entertainers and sportspeople, even though it acknowledged those liable would be unlikely to be aware of their liabilities and the potential penalties consequent on their <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> these <b>obligations,</b> and HMRC would find them, to all practicalities, unenforceable on those liable...|$|R
40|$|Razmejitev pristojnosti med EU in državami članicami je določena v PUE in ponazarja razmerje med skupnostjo in njenimi deli. Zanjo velja načelo prenosa pristojnosti, ki določa, da ima EU pristojnosti, ki so jih države članice prenesle nanjo. Za nadzor izvajanja pristojnosti je s PEU veljalo načelo subsidiarnosti, pri katerem EU deluje na področjih, ki niso v njeni izključni pristojnosti samo, če države članice ne morejo doseči ciljev predlaganih ukrepov in se le-ti lažje dosežejo na ravni EU. V načelu sorazmernosti oblast ukrepa samo toliko in tako, da je ukrep nujen, torej je sorazmeren cilju. Vrste pristojnosti so določene v pogodbi, in sicer se delijo na izključne pristojnosti EU, deljene pristojnosti med EU in državami članicami ter na dodatne pristojnosti. Kjer ima EU izključno pristojnost sama, izdaja in sprejema akte, države članice posežejo le v primeru, če jih EU pooblasti za njihovo izvajanje. Pri deljeni pristojnosti tako EU kot države članice izdajajo in sprejemajo akte, torej tam, kjer EU ne izvaja, izvajajo države članice. Pri dodatnih pristojnosti EU sprejme ukrepe za podporo in uskladitev ukrepov držav članic. V magistrskem delu me je zanimalo, koliko sodb je bilo vloženih proti državam članicam zaradi neupoštevanja nadoblasti EU, kar se šteje za kršitev pogodb. Evropska komisija je predlagala Sodišču EU, naj ugotovi, ali posamezna država članica izpolnjuje naložene obveznosti EU. O tem, ali je tožba obsodilna oziroma oprostilna, je odločalo Sodišče EU. Osredotočila sem se na tožbe zaradi neizpolnitve obveznosti držav članic v letih 2013 – 2016 glede na področja izključnih, deljenih in dodatnih pristojnosti. The {{delimitation}} of competences {{between the}} EU and member states is {{laid down in}} the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and it illustrates {{the relationship between the}} community and its parts. The principle of delegation is valid for the delimitation of competences which provides that the EU has competences reordered to it by member state. The principle of subsidiarity is in TEU. It surveillance implementations competences in which the EU operates in areas where they cannot fall under its exclusive competence only if the objectives of the proposed action cannot be achieved by the member state and can be better achieved at EU level. In the principle of proportionality, the authority takes action but only so much is necessary so it can proportionate to the goal. Types of competences are laid down in the Treaty which are divided into the exclusive competence of the EU, shared competences between the EU and member states and additional competences. Where the EU has exclusive competence itself issuing and adopting acts. Member states intervene only if the EU authorizes them to implement acts. In the case of shared competence both the EU and member states issue and accept some acts, in case where the EU does not implement it, they are implemented by the member states. For additional competences the EU takes measures to support and coordinate actions of member states. In the master 2 ̆ 7 s thesis I was interested in how many judgments were brought against member states because of disregard of the authority EU which is considered breach of contracts. The European commission has asked the EU court to determine whether each member state fulfils imposed EU obligations. The court of justice has ruled whether action was convict or released. I have focused on actions for <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> <b>obligations</b> of member states in the years 2013 - 2016 in terms of areas of exclusive, shared and additional competences...|$|E
40|$|Anarchy in Traffic: Merely a Regrettable State of Affairs or a Breach of Fundamental Rights?] The {{level of}} {{security}} in Estonian traffic is tragically low. Considering {{the size of the}} population of the nation, the fact that every year more than two hundred people lose their lives on the roads and streets of Estonia is indeed highly worrisome. As the author points out, the word “anarchy” is perhaps most accurate to describe the Estonian traffic culture. Against this background the author seeks to demonstrate, firstly, that the key to influencing the traffic culture and bringing about positive changes lies primarily in the hands of the Estonian Government. Secondly, he argues that guaranteeing traffic security is not the State’s privilege, but a legal obligation (springing, first of all, from the right to life) and the <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> this <b>obligation</b> results not merely in moral, but legal responsibility. Thirdly, he holds that by way of neglecting its obligation to perform traffic surveillance, the Estonian Government is in breach of its obligations under the Constitution of the Republic of Estonia as well as under the European Convention of Human Rights...|$|R

This problem is in the whole country, not just in one city or in one social class. A {{very large number of}} families from everywhere around Georgia have been affected. How and where it started will be discussed below in the text. Rights of creditors and debtors overlap in many aspects. We need to be very careful when sorting out this issue. We cannot under any circumstances make a decision with a benefit of one party while the other party will suffer losses. Georgian law on “Law Enforcement ” does not support in any ways rights of debtors and all the procedures highlighted are towards forcing the debtor to pay off the debt. At this stage based on the current law, current socio-economic problems, statistics, ways on sorting out the problem, this object of studies is very important and has a very high intrinsic value in its theoretical part as well as in its practical part. If the right approach is taken it is possible to minimise the need to protect rights of creditors or debtors in the futures, because every party will be fully aware of their abilities and punishments for <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> their <b>obligations,</b> before signing the contrac...|$|R
40|$|The International Court of Justice (ICJ) {{has dealt}} with the {{problems}} connected with nuclear weapons already in several cases, both in contentious cases and advisory opinions. The latest cases were instituted {{at the end of}} April 2014 when the Republic of the Marshall Islands submitted applications against nine nuclear weapon states, for their alleged <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> their <b>obligations</b> with respect to the cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and nuclear disarmament (Obligations concerning Negotiations relating to Cessation of the Nuclear Arms Race and to Nuclear Disarmament cases). The author offers a close analysis of the applications with special regard to the jurisdictional problems and some questions connected with the merits of the cases. The jurisdictional problems are emerging from the fact that from the nine states against which the Marshall Islands instituted proceeding only three are parties to the Court’s optional clause system and the case of the other six states depends on whether these states will accept the Court’s jurisdiction for the cases instituted by the Marshall Islands. As regards the merits of the cases, the outcome of the cases will depend on how the Court will interpret the notion of nuclear disarmament, and whether it will accept that in contemporary international law there exist a customary norm of nuclear disarmament. ...|$|R

40|$|How is Nigeria’s <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> its <b>obligations</b> as a {{signatory}} of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to {{be appreciated}} or even resolved? Answers to this are sought through a seminal criticism of human rights, namely, Simone Weil’s 1942 essay Human Personality. Weil questioned {{the ability of}} human rights concepts to cause the powerful to develop the emotional dispositions of empathy for those who suffer. Weil’s insights provide a convincing explanation that the indifference of Nigerian authorities towards the Convention may {{be accounted for by}} the weakness of human rights discourse to foster human capacity for empathy and care for those who suffer. Weil’s criticisms will serve as a point of departure for a particular way to circumvent this inadequacy of human rights discourse to achieve disability justice in Nigeria through other means. I argue that Weil, through her concept of attention, grappled with and offers a consciousness of suffering and vulnerability that is not only uncommon to existing juridical human rights approaches, but is achievable through the active participation in the very forms of suffering and vulnerability in which amelioration is sought. To provide empirical content to this argument, I turn to a short-lived initiative of the Nigerian disability movement, which if ethico-politically refined and widely applied, can supply an action-theoretical grounding for and be combined with Weil’s work to elevate agitations for disability justice above human rights to the realm of human obligations...|$|R
40|$|Notwithstanding a {{cultural}} {{critique of the}} concepts that underpin the values of academic integrity, both the university, as a community of scholarship, and the legal profession, as a vocation self-defined by integrity, retain traditional values. Despite the lack of direct relevance of plagiarism to legal practice, courts now demonstrate little tolerance for applicants for admission against whom findings of academic misconduct have been made. Yet this lack of tolerance is neither fatal nor absolute, with the most egregious forms of academic misconduct, coupled with less than complete candour, resulting in {{no more than a}} deferral of an application for admission for six months. Where allegations are of a less serious nature, law schools deal with allegations in a less formal or punitive fashion, regarding it as an educative function of the university, assisting students to understand the cultural practices of scholarship. For law students seeking admission to practice, applicants are under an obligation of complete candour in disclosing any matters that bear on their suitability, including any finding of academic misconduct. Individual legal academics, naturally adhering to standards of academic integrity, often have only a general understanding of the admissions process. Applying appropriate standards of academic integrity, legal academics can create difficulties for students seeking admission by not recognising a pastoral obligation to ensure that students have a clear understanding of the impact adverse findings will have on admission. <b>Failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> this <b>obligation</b> deprives students of the opportunity to take prompt remedial action as well as presenting practical problems for the practitioner who moves their admission...|$|R
