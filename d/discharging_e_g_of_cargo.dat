40|$|Since the {{expansion}} of soil-less culture in the Netherlands in the mid-eighties of the previous century, emission of nutrients and plant protection products (PPP’s) used in the root environment was considered as a huge problem. Eventually, the government and growers organisations reached an agreement which aimed at reducing the N, P and PPP emissions. For soil-less culture, reuse of drain water or closed growing systems became obligatory. Recently, the regulation changed by shifting the focus on reaching emission targets for N rather reaching 100 % closure of the systems. Yet, recirculation is still the key issue for reaching the goal of zero emission by 2027. These closed systems will potentially lead to substantial reduction of mineral leaching to the environment, however, they require adequate water quality and nutrient management. Moreover, satisfactory disinfection to control root diseases and removal of organic components is needed. In practice, substantial loss of water and minerals still occurs occasionally, when growers decide to flush the system and drainage water is partially discharged to the surface water or sewage system, causing emission of nutrients and PPP’s. There are several reasons for growers to <b>discharge</b> <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> accumulation <b>of</b> Na, mismanagement in EC or pH or nutrient supply, and serious problems with soil borne diseases or growth inhibition. This paper will give {{an overview of the}} state of the art of systems for nutrient solution recycling, and the requirements for water treatment, water quality and nutrient supply and strategies to obtain the highest efficiencies for nutrient and water use...|$|R
40|$|A brief {{review is}} given of the {{progress}} in studying the long-lived filaments (LLFs) in fusion plasmas (tokamaks, Z-pinch, plasma focus). The paper reports on (i) resolving the fine structure of LLFs, and (ii) verification of our hypothesis (1998) which suggested the LLFs to possess a microsolid skeleton. The recent proof-of-concept studies showed the presence of tubular and cartwheel-like structures in (i) various dust deposits in tokamak T- 10, in the range 10 nm - 10 mcm, and (ii) visible light images of plasma, in the range 100 mcm - 10 cm, at initial stage <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> before appearance <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> electric current) in tokamak, plasma focus and vacuum spark. The topological similarity of the above structures (especially, "cartwheels") and the observed trend of assembling bigger tubules from smaller ones (i. e. the self-similarity) allow to draw {{a bridge between the}} microdust skeletons in the dust deposits and the centimeter scale LLFs in fusion plasmas.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} oxidation of anionic (sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate) and cationic (hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium chloride) aqueous dilute,surfactant solutions at a BDD (boron-doped diamond) electrode {{has been studied}} by batch electrolysis experiments and potentiodynamic measurements. In the potential region of water decomposition (E > 2. 3 V vs. SHE), surfactants could be deactivated and oxidised with total organic carbon (TOC) removals up to 82 % {{by the action of}} intermediates <b>of</b> water <b>discharge</b> (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> hydroxyl radicals). <b>Of</b> the investigated process parameters, the initial electrolyte pH had the highest impact on surfactant oxidation. An initial pH of 10 significantly enhanced the {{electrochemical oxidation}} of both surfactants. The process was not diffusion-controlled and instantaneous current efficiencies (ICE) for TOC removal were in all cases low, varying from 5 to 12 % oil average. The surfactant deactivation and oxidation potential of the BDD electrode was compared with other carbon-based electrodes. Applying an equal electrode surface, the BDD electrode showed much higher surfactant removals compared to plane graphite. Graphite granules and carbon felt suffered from abrasion, leading to additional carbon loading of the surfactant solutions. Based on the current electrolysis configuration, the specific energy requirement with the BDD electrode for the electrochemical oxidation of surfactants was estimated at 10 - 20 kW h m(- 3) effective wastewater.

40|$|Music and Arts in Action (MAiA), a refereed, {{multidisciplinary}} journal, invites submissions for a thematic issue examining mediation {{in music}} and other performance, visual and literary arts, to appear in volume 5 (1), 2012. By mediation, we mean the various forces that shape or structure how art products are produced, transmitted and experienced by their consumers. As demonstrated by scholars of actor-network theory, objects themselves play active roles in their own mediation by affording unanticipated opportunities for engagement. Artistic mediation may take place through technologies (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>of</b> musical production/consumption), in situations (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> dance classes) and during processes (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>of</b> artistic creation, editing or critique).

We tested this approach in the context of multiple stressors (i. e. chemical and physical) in a selection of six run-of-river reservoirs with different levels of sediment contamination and associated upstream and downstream river sites. A niche-based approach was tested using three functional traits (habitat, food preferences and body size) and discrepancy between the realized and theoretical niches. We first identified three groups of taxa and then recorded differences along the disturbance gradients, such as an increase in competition, a narrowing of spatial and trophic niche breadth (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>of</b> Leuctra major and Gammarus pulex), a widening of spatial niche breadth (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>of</b> Ephemerella ignita), a greater proportion <b>of</b> small individuals (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>of</b> <b>G.</b> pulex) and a decreasing or an increasing (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> L. major) discrepancy between realized and theoretical niches.

We simulated spawning migrations by accounting for energetic demands for an average individual in the population {{from the time of}} entry into the Fraser River estuary to arrival on the spawning grounds (about 1, 200 km upstream) and estimated energy expenditures for the average migrant during 1950 – 2001.

40|$|Saccade-generating burst neurons (BN) are {{inhibited}} by omnipause neurons (OPN), {{except during}} saccades. OPN activity pauses before saccade onset and resumes at the saccade end. Microstimulation of OPN stops saccades in mid-flight, {{which shows that}} OPN can end saccades. However, OPN pause duration does not correlate well with saccade duration, and saccades are normometric after OPN lesions. We tested whether OPN were responsible for stopping saccades both in late-onset Tay–Sachs, which causes premature saccadic termination, and in individuals with cerebellar hypermetria. We studied gaze shifts between two targets at different distances aligned on one eye, which consist of a disjunctive saccade followed by vergence. High-frequency conjugate oscillations during the vergence movements that followed saccades were present in all subjects studied, indicating OPN silence.
