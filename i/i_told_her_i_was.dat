2500|$|On {{her fifth}} album, Ciara {{contributed to both}} the writing and {{production}} of the album's songs. She wrote [...] "Sweat" [...] (featuring 2 Chainz), a song that was originally {{supposed to be the}} album's first single when the album was called One Woman Army. Ciara also co-wrote and co-produced [...] "Sorry", the song that was chosen to supersede [...] "Sweat" [...] as one of One Woman Armys two lead singles, along with [...] "Got Me Good", also written by Ciara. None of these records made the final album. [...] "Sorry" [...] was co-written and co-produced by Jasper Cameron, who previously worked with Ciara on her 2006 single [...] "Promise" [...] and 2009 single [...] "Never Ever". Together the duo wrote and produced [...] "Super Turnt Up" [...] which did make the final listing for Ciara. [...] "Got Me Good" [...] was co-written with Rodney Jerkins and Livvi Franc (Olivia Waith). When interviewed by Rap-Up TV, Jerkins said [...] "I had a meeting with her about what her future holds and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there if she ever needed my creative juices, so hopefully me and her get in the studio and work." [...] Jerkins previously produced records for [...] and Fantasy Ride.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{ready to}} explain my self, {{if she would}} give me her Word, she would not resent it, and would take nothing ill.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I met {{the owner}} in Rome last winter. It {{belongs to a}} Mrs. Craddock, and when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> looking out for a house, she {{suggested}} that I should come and see this.' ...|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know how}} I did it. I {{did it in}} a moment. I intercepted Jip. I had Dora in my arms. I was full of eloquence. I never stopped for a word. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> how <b>I</b> loved <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> should die without <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> idolized and worshipped her. Jip barked madly all the time.|$|R
50|$|She {{liked the}} {{paintings}} too. But when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> wanted to paint {{her as she}} appeared in SwanLake, she sadly shook her head.|$|R
6000|$|... "So do I, {{but not so}} much as I {{thought at}} that time, and--oh, surely that is not Rachel Curtis? <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> thought you would call." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course they}} are; Cousin Marilda, in a bonnet like a {{primrose}} bank, is {{to pick up}} Fernan somewhere, but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> too true to my principles to let wild horses drag me there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He'll do that," [...] said David. [...] "He did it last time. My dear missis could scarce {{believe her}} ears when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> converted, or {{her eyes when}} she saw the Bethel-flag and the temperance pledge." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{she thanked}} {{me for being}} so REASONABLE <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> [...] not doing it to please her, but for Paul's sake, because I [...] would not spoil his life, and that I would always hate her. [...] She smiled again and went away.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Kilcullen. [...] "I have bid {{her good}} bye. But give her my kindest love, and tell <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> did what <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> would do." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> had met <b>her</b> on Saturday last, {{had been}} so {{fortunate}} as to render her a trifling service, and was come now on the young lady's invitation.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Mrs. Somers!' she whispers, {{her eyes}} poppin'. 'Are you crazy?' An' <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> shore wasn't crazy an' I shore was sober. An' thet my name wasn't Moran, but Somers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. It {{was terrible}} {{she seemed to}} feel so. And I was sorry for her. I thought I ought to answer it, and I did. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sorry, too. I tried not to blame Richard. I don't believe I did. And I tried not to blame him. She was feeling badly enough without that." ...|$|E
60|$|I hadn't seen {{my mother}} {{in a year or}} so. And when I got there she knew my face; knew I was married; knew I had a family, and that I was living with them. But she couldn't, for the life of her, tell my name or who I was. So <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> her boy.|$|E
6000|$|... "My good opinion makes {{allowance}} {{for the state}} of my poor darling's mind, after the shock that has fallen on her," [...] Alban answered quietly. [...] "She is not my Emily now. She will be my Emily yet. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> convinced of it, in the old days at school--and my conviction is as strong as ever. Have you seen her, since I have been away at Netherwoods?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Grandfather, {{this letter}} is from my aunt. She wishes me to go and live with her and prepare for the stage. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> wished to do so. I am going." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; {{no doubt}} you will too. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> should come to you, {{and she did not}} object. I think she was glad to be saved {{broaching}} the subject, for she is half ashamed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She wouldn't {{go in the}} parlour, {{but come}} right out here in <b>her</b> fine clothes. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> didn't think she belonged in a kitchen--but I guess <b>I</b> did <b>her</b> an injustice," [...] said Euphrasia, slowly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'So I saw her,' pursued Walter, 'Susan, I mean: and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> off {{and away}} to-morrow. And I said, Uncle, {{that you had}} always had an {{interest}} in Miss Dombey since that night when she was here, and always wished her well and happy, and always would be proud and glad to serve her in the least: I thought I might say that, you know, under the circumstances. Don't you think so?' ...|$|E
60|$|Again I did {{not return}} to Nelson Square until the early hours, and the next morning did not venture out until I had heard Miss Sellars, who {{appeared}} to be in a bad temper, leave the house. Then running {{to the top of the}} kitchen stairs, I called for Mrs. Peedles. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to leave her, and, judging the truth to be the simplest explanation, I told her the reason why.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{then it was}} up to me. And she waited. I don't mind confessing that I was sorely tempted. I {{was half}} in love with her as it was. You know I have never married. And I don't mind adding, looking back over my life, that she is the only woman that ever {{affected}} me that way. But it was too preposterous, the whole thing, and I lied like a gentleman. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> already married.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} she doesn't think that I {{care much about}} it. When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> did it all of a heap, you see; and I fancy she thought I was just mad at the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I gave Aunt Mary <b>her</b> {{gift this}} morning. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> wasn't going to Murraybridge, that I just meant {{to stay home}} with her. She was so glad--and I'm glad, too, now that I've decided so." ...|$|R
60|$|It is easy {{to judge}} what a fright I was in upon this occasion, and it was {{impossible}} for my governess ever to bring me to dress in that disguise again; for, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> should certainly betray myself.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Foss laughed. [...] "Said I was a wrong 'un," [...] he said, cheerfully, [...] "and {{would bring}} my mother's gray hairs {{to the grave}} with sorrow. I'm to 'ave bad companions and take to drink; I'm to steal money to gamble with, and after all that I'm to 'ave five years for bigamy. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{disappointed}} I wasn't to be hung, and she {{said it would be}} a disappointment to {{a lot of other people}} too. Laugh! I thought I should 'ave killed myself." ...|$|E
60|$|O'FLAHERTY. I {{never told}} her one word that wasn't the {{truth and nothing but}} the truth. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to fight for the French and for the Russians; and sure who ever heard of the French or the Russians doing {{anything}} to the English but fighting them? That was how it was, sir. And sure the poor woman kissed me and went about the house singing in her old cracky voice that the French was on the sea, and they'd be here without delay, and the Orange will decay, says the Shan Van Vocht.|$|E
6000|$|... "I just couldn't help it, Buck. I {{seen her}} through the window a-comin' in. She never had heard a word 'bout my tough ways. I didn't {{have the nerve to}} let her know I was a {{worthless}} cuss bein' hunted down by the community. There you was lyin' where my shot laid you, like you was dead. The idea struck me sudden, and I just took your badge off and fastened it onto myself, and I fastened my reputation onto you. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the marshal and you was a holy terror. You can take your badge back now, Buck." ...|$|E
6000|$|Clementina's face brightened. She wanted {{very much}} to go. She should meet some {{pleasant}} people; she always did, at Miss Milray's. Then the light died out of her gay eyes, and she set <b>her</b> lips. [...] "No, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't go." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{says she}} shall stop till I come back, as {{she wants to}} see me again before she goes. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> might not be back for a month. She said it didn't matter; she had plenty of time, and would wait for me.|$|R
60|$|It became intolerable. Her ladyship, my Mistress, {{coming in}} one day when I was alone, and {{at the height of}} feeling that I could support it no longer, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> must go. I could not bear the {{presence}} of that woman Dawes.|$|R
60|$|As {{we began}} to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more to me, and asked me such {{questions}} as what had I learnt and what was I going to be? <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to be apprenticed to Joe, I believed; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything, {{in the hope that}} she might offer some help towards that desirable end. But she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer my being ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money,--or anything but my daily dinner,--nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my services.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told her}} that I had been to most places south-eastward and eastward, but never across the Atlantic. She {{informed}} me that I ought to have gone to Chicago, and that America was a great country, and I remarked that I had {{always thought it was}} so great that one could best appreciate it at a distance. Then she asked me what I thought of the condition of the lower classes, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> persuaded, from various things I had noticed, that {{a lot of them were}} frightfully hard up. And with that she started off to show whose fault it was, by the Socratic method." ...|$|E
6000|$|She told me I {{should be}} judge {{of that when}} I saw them. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sorry {{to tell her that}} I feared I must be her lowest-rated customer. 'And perhaps, madam,' said I, 'you will make me the less welcome upon that account.' 'No, not at all,' said she; 'for where I have one of the third sort I have two of the second, and four to one of the first, and I get as much by them in {{proportion}} as by any; but if you doubt my care of you, I will allow any friend you have to overlook and see if you are well waited on or no.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have come}} across your milking-stool, I estimate, some {{thirteen}} times," [...] <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> fetched it from where I had left it, {{and gave it}} to her; and we filed out in procession; Veronica with a galvanised iron bucket bringing up the rear.|$|R
60|$|Viola's {{carriage}} was now actually coming, and as I {{went into}} the house with her, she held me, whispering to me to come home at once with <b>her,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> could not leave them in that way, and they were really my nephews.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all {{the trouble}} we had had in {{connection}} with the cow. Her sympathies were chiefly with the cow. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> had hopes of Robina's developing into a sensible woman. We talked quite a deal about Robina. We agreed that between us we had accomplished something rather clever.|$|R
