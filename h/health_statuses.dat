Method: As part of the TRIL clinic assessment, we gathered information from 473 community dwelling adults {{over the age of}} 65, regarding hours spent per week exercising, depression, personality, perceived <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> and objective <b>health</b> <b>status</b> (in the form of a comorbidity count). Regression analyses were performed on these data to investigate whether perceived <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> objective <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> personality and mood are associated with hours of exercise per week. Results: Perceived and objective <b>health</b> <b>status</b> were significantly but weakly correlated. Both perceived and objective <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> as well as depression, were independently associated with hours of exercise per week. Conclusions: We conclude that exercise uptake in older adults is contingent on both perceived and objective <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> as well as depression. Perceived <b>health</b> <b>status</b> has a stronger association with exercise uptake in older adults with lower depression levels.

50|$|Pests are {{becoming}} resistant to pesticides, or pesticides may be killing off the useful and necessary insects. Examples of this happening occur around the globe. Tanzania experienced a particularly horrible infection of armyworms in 2005. At the infections peak, {{there were over}} 1000 larva per square meter. In 2009, Liberia experienced {{a state of emergency}} when invading African armyworm caterpillars began what became a regional food crisis. The caterpillars traveled through 65 towns and 20 000 people were forced to leave their homes, markets, and farms. Losses like this can cost millions to billions, depending on size and duration, and have severe effects on food security. The FAO has created an international team, the Plant Production and Protection Division, which is attempting to ‘reduce reliance on pesticides’ and ‘demonstrate that pesticide use often can be reduced considerably without affecting yields or farmer profits' in these, and other hard-struck areas.Water stress, desertification, and erosion are leading to loss of arable land. Agricultural practices use the bulk of the Earth’s fresh water - up to 70 percent - and those numbers are predicted to rise by 50-100 percent by 2025’. Countries are being forced to divert more water than ever before to irrigate their land. Hydroelectric dams and mega-canal projects {{are becoming}} the new standard for countries like Egypt that can no longer depend on rainfall or natural flood cycles. These water shortages are also causing a source of conflict between neighboring nations as they live with increasingly high levels of water scarcity. Policy responses to these events could be implemented in order to strengthen the socio-economic growth, human <b>health</b> <b>statuses,</b> and environmental sustainability of these areas. Combining current limitations with water and transitions from practices such as agroforestry and shifting cultivation makes land susceptible to aeolian erosion by weakening soil composition and exposing larger areas of land to destructive wind. Aeolian erosion largely effects deserted areas, reducing air quality, polluting water sources, and limiting fertility of nearby land.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Building on an {{emerging}} scientific {{consensus that the}} concept of child health should encompass chronic conditions, functional abilities, and developmental domains, we delineate the multidimensional <b>health</b> <b>statuses</b> of Mexican, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic white preschool children in the United States. This integrative approach provides the foundation for an in-depth analysis of health disparities. OBJECTIVE The research objectives are: (1) to demonstrate a new methodological approach to identifying the major child health statuses; (2) to document differences in the prevalence of those <b>health</b> <b>statuses</b> among children in the largest ethnoracial groups in the U. S.; and (3) to assess whether key sources of disadvantage account for ethnoracial disparities in children's health. METHODS With data from a nationally representative sample, we use latent class analysis to estimate a set of latent <b>health</b> <b>statuses</b> that capture the nature of health at age four. The latent class membership of children is predicted using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS Mexican and non-Hispanic black children are more likely than non-Hispanic white children to fall into <b>health</b> <b>statuses</b> distinguished by low cognitive achievement and multiple developmental problems. Mexican children are the most likely to be classified into these problematic <b>health</b> <b>statuses.</b> This pattern persists in multivariate models that incorporate potential explanatory factors, including health at birth, socio-demographic characteristics, home environment, well-child care and center-based child care. CONCLUSIONS Latent class analysis is a useful method for incorporating measures of physical conditions, functional problems, and development into a single analysis in order to identify key dimensions of childhood health and locate ethnoracial health disparities...|$|E

Using a panel data, we find that work sector {{have a significant effect on}} workers’ <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> due to their different levels of social protection. In particular, workers in the market sector tend to have poorer <b>health</b> <b>status</b> than those in the state sector.

Results were inconsistent in the literature {{about the relationship between}} their <b>health</b> <b>statuses</b> and social integration. The main difference exists on how to measure the social integration and whether <b>health</b> <b>statuses</b> of internal migrants improve with years of residence. To complement the existing literature, this study measured social integration more comprehensively and estimated the internal migrants' <b>health</b> <b>statuses</b> with varying years of residence, and explored the associations between the migrants' social integration and health. We used the data from 2014 Internal Migrant Dynamic Monitoring Survey of Health and Family Planning in ZhongShan, China. Health status was measured from four aspects: self-reported health, subjective well-being, perception of stress, mental health. We measured social integration through four dimensions: economy, social communication, acculturation, and self-identity. The analyses used multiple linear regressions to examine the associations between self-reported health, subjective well-being, and perception of stress, mental health and social integration. The analytical sample included 1, 999 households of the internal migrants and 1, 997 local registered households, who were permanent residents in ZhongShan. Among the internal migrants, Adults in the labor force, who were aged 25 to 44 years old, accounted for 91. 2 % of the internal migrant population, while 74. 6 % of the registered population were in that age group. Median residential time among migrants was 2. 8 (1. 3 - 6. 2) years, and 20. 2 % of them were migrating in the same Guangdong province. Except for mental health, other <b>health</b> <b>statuses</b> among migrants had significant differences compared with local registered population, e. g. self-reported health was better, but subjective well-being was worse. However, these health measurements were improved with more years of residence. Moreover, our results show that two aspects of social integration, economic integration and self-identity, were significantly associated with health status. Subjective feeling of relative social status levels were more associated with health, which prompted the attention to social fairness {{and the creation of a}} fair and respectful culture. More interventions could be experimented, such as encouraging internal migrants to participate in community activities more actively, educating local registered residents to treat internal migrants more equally, and developing self-identity among internal migrants.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest {{in the use of}} outcome indicators to monitor the quality of care. Traditionally, outcome indicators have been based mainly on biological indicators reflecting death or disease. Now that various instruments for <b>health</b> <b>status</b> measurement have become available, questions have been raised as to the potential application of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> scores in monitoring the quality of care. This paper identifies conditions which should be fulfilled before such applications can be recommended. Firstly, the relationship between care delivery processes and <b>health</b> <b>status</b> outcomes must be established. In order to achieve this, <b>health</b> <b>status</b> measures which are clearly able to detect <b>health</b> <b>status</b> variations between groups of patients (i. e. discriminative ability) and variations over time (i. e. sensitivity to change) are needed. Secondly, <b>health</b> <b>status</b> data should be available, preferably from established data collection registries (e. g. computerized hospital records or national registries) where data relating to the description of variations in <b>health</b> <b>status</b> (between physicians, hospitals, regions, etc.) are routinely collected. Thirdly, methods should be found to collect additional data, including 'case-mix' information and <b>health</b> <b>status</b> reference data, in order to enable the interpretation of variations in <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Because most of these conditions are currently not being fulfilled, we conclude that the state-of-the-art of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> measurement has not yet matured sufficiently to allow for the use of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> as an indicator of quality of care.

There is growing literature about <b>health</b> <b>status</b> measures in patients with asthma and chronic obstruc-tive pulmonary disease (COPD). The European Respiratory Journal (ERJ) has published numerous articles on issues related to <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> The authors believe that the ERJ is a valuable resource in this area, especially for summarizing updated issues on the <b>health</b> <b>status</b> of pulmonary disease [1], or vali-dating new questionnaires or comparing <b>health</b> <b>status</b> measures. Clinicians need to understand and critically eva-luate measurements of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> in order to determine if a new therapy could be applied to their own patients with expectation of improving their <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> However, {{it is also true that}} many readers face confusion and difficulty in interpreting the results of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> measures. Important concepts when evaluating measurements of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> are the {{clinically significant}} threshold or the minimal clinically significant difference (MCSD) [2]. When <b>health</b> <b>status</b> is measured using a continuous scale, it needs to be known whether an observed difference indicates a clinically significant or trivial effect on the patients 9 <b>health</b> <b>status</b> or quality of life.

Studying <b>health</b> <b>status</b> trajectories and their baseline determinants would permit the identification of patients at risk for poor health outcomes after ICD implantation. A combined cohort of 1, 222 patients with an ICD (79 % men; age = 61. 4 [11. 2] years) completed the 12 -Item Short-Form Health Survey at baseline and 2 to 3 months and 12 to 14 months after implantation. Latent class analyses were used to identify trajectories and predictors of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> over time. Most <b>health</b> <b>status</b> trajectories showed a stable pattern after short-term follow-up, with differences between trajectories being mainly related to differences in absolute levels of <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Seven trajectories were identified for physical <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Being unemployed, symptomatic heart failure, ICD shock, psychotropic medication, negative affectivity, and type D personality were identified as independent determinants of poorer physical <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> For mental <b>health</b> <b>status,</b> 6 trajectories were identified. Younger age, low educational level, symptomatic heart failure, renal failure, no use of ACE inhibitors, psychotropic medication, negative affectivity, and type D personality were identified as independent determinants of poorer mental <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> In conclusion, the population with an ICD seems to be heterogeneous in terms of patient-reported physical and mental <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Patients with an ICD who present with poor <b>health</b> <b>status</b> and a distressed personality profile should be timely identified and monitored as they may benefit from cardiac rehabilitation in combination with behavioral intervention...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Communication {{contains}} the immunology data treatment. New nonlinear methods of immunofluorescence {{statistical analysis of}} peripheral blood neutrophils have been devel-oped. We used technology of respiratory burst reaction of DNA fluorescence in the neutro-phils cells nuclei due to oxidative activity. The histograms of photon count statistics for the radiant neutrophils populations in flow cytometry experiments are considered. Distributions of the fluorescence flashes frequency as functions of the fluorescence intensity are analyzed. Square of deviations on the mean level of fluorescence flashes number considered as the probability measure of immunofluorescence fluctuations. Shannon information entropy, the square of fluctuations, their wavelet and wavelet spectra are investigated for medical diagnos-tics. Immunofluorescence fractal structure is analyzed for Hurst exponent and Shannon Weaver indices of biodiversity in the spaces of fluctuations, their wavelet and wavelet spectra. Biodiversity of fluorescence neutrophil populations has increasing tendency for oncology dis-eases, with anomalous increase of correspondence fractal dimension. We observe the univer-sal exponential distribution of the central moments for information entropies. Parameters of exponential decrease are various for different <b>health</b> <b>statuses.</b> Therefore we have new tools to conduct diagnostics and monitoring of <b>health</b> <b>statuses</b> with the exponentially high sensitivity, precision and accuracy. Health or illness criteria are connected with statistics features of im-munofluorescence histograms. Neutrophils populations fluorescence presents the sensitive clear indicator of health status...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 34 - 40) The {{purpose of}} this study was to investigate whether the night shift increased the risk of obesity among nurses. The study examined different factors that might influence night shift nurses towards obesity, incorporating other research on obesity, nurses, night shift hazards, etc. Physical and biological factors that attributed to nurses working night shifts were also discussed. Research was conducted at a hospital in Southern California and included 17 day shift nurses and 51 night shift nurses as respondents. A self-report survey was used to collect quantitative data related to the <b>health</b> <b>statuses</b> of night and day shift nurses including their Body Mass Index (BMI), eating habits and food intakes, medical history, and supplement usage. SPSS was used for the analyses, and t-tests and chi-square measures compared day and night shift nurses on factors related to health. The study did not reveal significant differences between night shift nurses and day shift nurses based on BMI, exercise levels, food intakes, etc., presumably due to the limited sample size. However, night shift nurses reported a higher percentage of hemorrhoids, and day shift nurses reported a higher occurrence of hypertension. Data from this study were compared against those discussed in the literature review. The findings specified the need for intervention tools in the form of educational programs, quality food, and monitoring of <b>health</b> <b>statuses</b> of nurses...|$|E
40|$|Internet {{access is}} {{associated}} with increases in health information seeking and benefits in <b>health</b> <b>statuses.</b> However, many individuals of low socioeconomic status (SES) lack Internet access, thereby creating significant disadvantages from a health perspective. In this project, we describe a potential project for providing affordable Internet access to a neighborhood of Newport, VT containing many SES individuals. This network includes a splash page that provides regular health event promotion and health information dissemination to everyone connecting the network. We then discuss how to determine the impacts of the Internet on multiple aspects of health within the community. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Panel {{data from}} the Los Angeles Health Survey (N = 903) were used to examine {{variables}} associated with changes in perceived <b>health</b> <b>status</b> over a one-year period. Our findings replicate previous research showing that perceived <b>health</b> <b>status</b> is associated with variations in chronic illness, disability, and the utilization of health services. However, we found that neither positive nor negative changes in perceived <b>health</b> <b>status</b> were related to any indicator of health beliefs or practices or physical <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> The data suggest that single item measures of perceived <b>health</b> <b>status</b> may reflect the individual's sense of long-standing chronic illness...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} <b>health</b> <b>status</b> on poverty status, accounting for the endogeneity of <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> Using exogenous measures of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> from the South African Integrated Health Survey, we instrument for <b>health</b> <b>status</b> while allowing for covariation among the unobservables influencing both health and household poverty <b>status.</b> <b>Health</b> <b>status,</b> as captured by the body mass index, is shown to strongly influence poverty status. Households that contain more unhealthy individuals are 60 % {{more likely to be}} income poor than households that contain fewer unhealthy individuals, and this finding appears invariant to the choice of poverty line. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the predictors of self-reported <b>health</b> <b>status</b> at follow-up in the Drug Abuse Treatment Outcomes Study (DATOS), a longitudinal study of drug abuse treatment programs and patients in 1991 - 1993. Baseline and follow-up interviews of 2966 patients in 75 programs were performed. The follow-up assessment was targeted to occur 12 months after treatment terminated; long-term methadone patients in treatment for the entire 12 -month period were interviewed 24 months after intake. A composite measure, developed through principal component analysis, assessed <b>health</b> <b>status.</b> A multivariate hierarchical linear regression model adjusted for identified independent baseline predictors of <b>health</b> <b>status</b> at follow-up. Poor physical <b>health</b> <b>status</b> (including the composite measure, comorbid conditions and pain) and greater severity of psychiatric symptoms at baseline were the strongest predictors of poor <b>health</b> <b>status</b> at follow-up. Other predictors of worse <b>health</b> <b>status</b> included older age, public insurance coverage and unemployment. We conclude that baseline <b>health</b> <b>status</b> and psychiatric symptoms predict the subsequent <b>health</b> <b>status</b> of patients in substance abuse treatment patients as in other clinical populations. Future research should examine whether early identification and treatment of {{physical and mental health}} problems among patients in addiction treatment programs might remediate their adverse effects on long-term <b>health</b> <b>status</b> outcomes...|$|R
