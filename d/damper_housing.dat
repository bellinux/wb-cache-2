The paper first discusses the path of stresses within the damper and subsequently via the use of elasticity theory shows that the experimental data obtained with commercially available strain gauges yield a force output of the damper that is in good agreement with the force output from the load cell. The experimental data show that the proposed arrangement is promising for monitoring in-situ the force output of fluid dampers and detect possible loss of their energy dissipation function...|$|E

DESIGN AND SETTING [...] Analysis of responses gathered in a cross sectional, postal questionnaire survey of a randomly selected sample of 5347 residents of Worcester. PARTICIPANTS [...] Altogether 2353 people aged 16 to 64 years responded to the survey (adjusted response 52 %). RESULTS [...] Nine per cent of respondents lived in housing which they reported to be damp. Rates were highest among young women. People who lived in <b>damp</b> <b>housing</b> {{were more likely to report}} long standing illness, disability, or infirmity; the increased prevalence could not be attributed to any particular medical condition. Perceived ill health, as measured by the sleep, energy, and social isolation dimensions of the Nottingham Health Profile, was also more common in this group. These associations could not be explained by lifestyle factors; the relationship proved strongest among people in non-manual social classes living in owner occupied housing. The prevalence of ill health increased as the severity of dampness increased.

METHOD: This follow up study included 16 190 subjects from Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Estonia who had participated in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS I). Eight years later the same subjects answered a postal questionnaire that included questions on respiratory symptoms and indicators of indoor dampness. RESULTS: Subjects living in <b>damp</b> <b>housing</b> (18 %) had a significantly (p< 0. 001) higher prevalence of wheeze (19. 1 % v 26. 0 %), nocturnal breathlessness (4. 4 % v 8. 4 %), nocturnal cough (27. 2 % v 36. 5 %), productive cough (16. 6 % v 22. 3 %) and asthma (6. 0 % v 7. 7 %). These associations remained significant after adjusting for possible confounders. Indoor dampness was a risk factor for onset of respiratory symptoms but not for asthma onset in the longitudinal analysis (OR 1. 13, 95 % CI 0. 92 to 1. 40). Remission of nocturnal symptoms was less common in damp homes (OR 0. 84, 95 % CI 0. 73 to 0. 97).

40|$|Hospital {{admissions and}} readmissions for asthma in early {{childhood}} remain causes for concern. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify predisposing risk factors related to asthma exacerbations and precursors of hospital admissions in young children. Subjects were patients with doctor-diagnosed asthma from a clinical registration study, aged 0 - 4 years, and followed up for 2 years. Data from histories and laboratory tests for atopic status at initial presentation, and the patient's condition at visits over the 2 -year follow-up period were evaluated. Exacerbation was defined as increases in cough and/or wheeze and/or breathlessness, increase in beta(2) -agonist use, and a clinical need for a short course of oral corticosteroids. Age groups 0 - 1 year and 2 - 4 years, based on age at initial presentation, were analyzed separately. In the age group 0 - 1 year, 71 / 113 (63 %) patients had at least one exacerbation, and 20 experienced recurrent exacerbations (greater than or equal to 3). Predisposing risk factors for exacerbation were <b>damp</b> <b>housing</b> (odds ratio (OR) 7. 6 (2. 0 - 28. 6)) and colds (OR 3. 6 (1. 4 - 9. 6)), and for recurrent exacerbations sensitization to inhalant allergens (Phadiatop(R)) (OR 8. 1 (1. 6 - 40. 5)) and <b>damp</b> <b>housing</b> (OR 3. 8 (1. 1 - 12. 8)). Hospital admissions were significantly associated with number of exacerbations. In the age group 2 - 4 years, 58 / 144 (40 %) patients had at least one exacerbation, and 21 experienced recurrent exacerbations (greater than or equal to 2). Predisposing risk factors for exacerbation were mean age at initial presentation (OR 0. 92 (0. 88 - 0. 97)) and level of total IgE (OR 2. 3 (1. 4 - 3. 9)), whereas for recurrent exacerbations no predictor variables were found. Hospital admissions were significantly associated with <b>damp</b> <b>housing.</b> Results from this study may facilitate recognition of young asthmatic patients at risk of (recurrent) exacerbations, and help to identify those in whom early intervention with antiinflammatory therapy may be necessary.

40|$|Abstract Background Since Germany re-unified in 1990, {{substantial}} {{social and}} economic changes have happened in East Germany, the former socialist German Democratic Republic (GDR). The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the influence of these socio-economic changes in East Germany on the association between social status, measured by parental educational level, and health-related living conditions of children during the ten-year period after re-unification. Methods In total, 25, 864 6 -year-old school beginner children (51. 2 % male and 48. 8 % female) participated in cross-sectional studies which have been repeated every year from 1991 to 2000 in East Germany. Parental educational level as a social indicator was the independent variable. Dependent variables included not employed parents, small living space and health-related living conditions (e. g. <b>damp</b> <b>housing,</b> single oven heating and living at busy road). The relationships were described by odds ratios using logistic regression. Results A large overall effect of parental educational level on health-related living conditions was observed. The time trends showed that the situation regarding small living space, <b>damp</b> <b>housing</b> conditions and single oven heating improved from 1991 to 2000, while regarding not employed parents (1996 – 2000) and living at busy road (1991 – 2000) did not, but even deteriorated. 6 -year old children with low parental educational level, who lived at the time of re-unification, were often under <b>damp</b> <b>housing</b> conditions and with single oven heating at homes. Nevertheless, this social inequality has almost vanished ten years later. In contrast, we found an increasing gap between low and high parental educational level with respect to the proportion of parents who were not employed (22 %: 4 % gain), or lived under cramped housing conditions (22 %: 37 % reduction), or close to a busy road (7 % gain: 2 % reduction). Conclusion The social inequalities which already existed under the socialist system in East Germany persisted in the system of social market economy between 1991 and 2000. 6 -year-old children from families with the lowest social status were living under the worst domestic conditions (e. g. living at busy road, having <b>damp</b> <b>housing</b> conditions, single oven heating and small living space) and for some conditions (e. g. living at busy road and having small living space) the gap betweenlow and high social status was even bigger in 2000 than in 1991. </p...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{association}} between <b>damp</b> <b>housing</b> and adult health, taking into account {{a wide range of}} other factors that may influence health and could confound this relation. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A general population sample of adults, aged 18 - 64, from Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire and Northamptonshire. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of responses to a postal questionnaire survey carried out in 1997 with a 64 % response rate (8889 of 13 800). Housing dampness was assessed by self report. Health was measured by responses to a series of questions including presence of asthma and longstanding illness generally, use of health services and perceived health status (the SF- 36). The effect of damp was examined using the chi(2) test and one way analysis of variance. Significant associations with the various health outcomes were further explored taking into account 35 other housing, demographic, psychosocial and lifestyle variables using stepwise logistic and linear regression. MAIN RESULTS: Bivariate analyses indicated that damp was associated with the majority of health outcomes. Regression modelling however, found that being unable to keep the home warm enough in winter was a more important explanatory variable. Worry about pressure at work {{and to a lesser extent}} about money, showed an independent association with perceived health status equal to or greater than that of the housing environment, including cold housing, and that of health related lifestyles. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that being unable to keep the home warm enough in winter is more strongly associated with health outcomes than is <b>damp</b> <b>housing.</b> However, as cold and <b>damp</b> <b>housing</b> are closely related, it is likely that their combined effects are shown in these results.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{epidemiological}} {{studies have reported}} a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms in subjects living in <b>damp</b> <b>housing,</b> but links with specific respiratory diseases such as asthma have not been satisfactorily established. METHODS: One hundred and two subjects with physician diagnosed asthma and 196 age and sex matched controls were interviewed; 222 (75 %) then agreed to have their dwelling surveyed for dampness. The prevalence of both self-reported and observed dampness {{in the homes of}} the asthmatic subjects and controls were compared. Both asthma and the severity of the dampness were quantified so that the possibility of a dose-response relationship could be investigated. RESULTS: Asthmatic subjects reported dampness in their current (odds ratio (OR) 1. 92, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 18 to 3. 12) and previous (OR 2. 11, 95 % CI 1. 29 to 3. 47) dwellings more frequently than control subjects. The surveyor confirmed dampness in 58 of 90 (64 %) dwellings of asthmatic subjects compared with 54 of 132 (41 %) dwellings of control subjects (OR 2. 62, 95 % CI 1. 50 to 4. 55). This association persisted after controlling for socioeconomic and other confounding variables (adjusted OR 3. 03, 95 % CI 1. 65 to 5. 57). The severity of asthma was found to correlate statistically with measures of total dampness (r = 0. 30, p = 0. 006) and mould growth (r = 0. 23, p = 0. 035) in the dwelling. Patients living in homes with confirmed areas of dampness had greater evidence of airflow obstruction than those living in dry homes (mean difference in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) 10. 6 %, 95 % CI 1. 0 to 20. 3). CONCLUSIONS: Asthma is associated with living in <b>damp</b> <b>housing</b> and {{there appears to be a}} dose-response relationship.

40|$|Factors {{operating}} {{in the first year}} of life are critical in determining the onset and persistence of wheezing in preschool children. This study was designed to examine the prevalence and risk factors of wheeze {{in the first year of}} life in Dutch infants. This was a population-based survey of 13 -month-old infants visiting well baby clinics for a scheduled immunization. Parents/caregivers completed a standardized validated questionnaire on respiratory symptoms in the first year of life and putative risk factors. The independent influence of these factors for wheeze was assessed by multiple logistic regression analysis. A total of 1, 115 questionnaires were completed. Wheeze ever (with a prevalence in the first year of life of 28. 5 %) was independently associated with male gender, eczema, sibs with asthma, any allergic disease in the family, day care, <b>damp</b> <b>housing,</b> and asphyxia. Recurrent wheeze (prevalence 14. 5 %) showed independent associations with eczema, sibs with asthma, and day care. In addition to these factors, severe wheeze (prevalence 15. 4 %) was also associated with premature rupture of membranes during birth, and with <b>damp</b> <b>housing.</b> Wheeze is common during the first year of life, and places a major burden on families and the health care system. Factors associated with wheeze are mainly related to markers of atopic susceptibility, and to exposure to infections.

The evidence suggests that people who live in poor <b>housing</b> (for example, <b>damp</b> <b>houses</b> with inadequate heating) {{are more likely to be}} in bad health, in respect of both general health and specific ailments, than persons living in good housing. There is also evidence that persons without educational qualifications are more likely to be in bad health than persons who have educational qualifications. Lastly, the results point to the fact that higher levels of household income are associated with better health outcomes. If one defines the “social gradient ” in terms of these three factors – housing quality, education qualifications, and income level – then the results suggest that people’s health outcomes depend upon their position on the social ladder...|$|R

The activities and ethos of energy suppliers {{plays a significant role}} in alleviating fuel poverty and the threats posed to health when living in a cold, damp and energy inefficient home. IPH shares the view of the World Health Organisation that more evidence is needed to demonstrate the real impact of corporate social responsibility in the provision of goods and services vital to health and well-being, such as fuel and water. The roles and responsibilities of energy suppliers in ensuring that vulnerable customers continue to receive essential supplies is currently being debated in both jurisdictions. Enhanced all-Ireland co-operation and collaboration would facilitate mutual learning and allow for evaluation of different policy approaches. Excess winter mortality among older people is the most extreme form of health inequality arising from fuel poverty. However, living in cold <b>damp</b> <b>houses</b> exerts negative healt...|$|R
40|$|Stachybotrys atra {{is often}} {{isolated}} from building materials in houses with moisture problems. Spores of S. atra can contain mycotoxins which {{may lead to}} various symptoms in exposed residents in <b>damp</b> <b>houses.</b> The pathogenesis of S. atra-induced lung diseases has not been elucidated. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate lung mycotoxicosis experimentally in mice after an intranasal exposure to spores of S. atra-fungus. One group of mice received one intranasal injection of spores of a toxic strain of S. atra (1 [*]×[*] 106 spores) and the other group spores of a less toxic strain. Spores of both strains contained spirolactones and spirolactams while the highly toxic strain contained also trichothecene mycotoxins, satratoxins. The spores containing satratoxins caused severe intra-alveolar, bronchiolar and interstitial inflammation with haemorrhagic exudative processes in the alveolar and bronchiolar lumen. A significant difference was observed in the severity of the lung damage caused by the two strains of S. atra. The spores without satratoxins induced a milder inflammation, so that the toxic compounds of S. atra-spores are most likely responsible for the severity of the lung injury...|$|R
40|$|Social housing {{residents}} often {{struggle with}} achieving adequate levels of warmth {{in their home}} on a limited household budget. Additionally, other housing problems such as damp are common. Previous research has found a link between housing problems and poor health and reduced well-being, but this relationship is complex and poorly understood. A survey among UK social housing residents (N= 536) investigated the association between cold and <b>damp</b> <b>housing,</b> {{as well as the}} role of energy affordability concerns in the relationship between housing problems and health. The findings indicated that struggles with keeping warm related to a cluster of damp and mould issues rather than any one specific issue. In describing these problems householders expressed a sense of frustration and helplessness. Support was found for an indirect effect on health whereby households experiencing cold, damp or mould issues reported more difficulty with affording their energy bills, these affordability concerns in turn related to poor health and well-being. The effects were found to be more consistent and stronger for men compared to women. Policies aimed at reducing housing problems should consider the important role of affordability concerns and the need for households to regain control of their energy bills...|$|R
40|$|Settlement is {{a complex}} process of {{adjustment}} for migrants and refugees. Drawing on recent research on the settlement experiences of Kiribati migrants and their families living in New Zealand, {{this article examines the}} role of housing as an influencer of the settlement and health of Kiribati migrants. Using qualitative methodology, in-depth interviews were conducted with fourteen Kiribati migrants (eight women and six men) representing 91 family members about the key issues and events that shaped their settlement in New Zealand. The stories told by participants affirm the association between housing and health. The study serves as an important reminder that children bear a great cost from living in poorly insulated and <b>damp</b> <b>housing,</b> and adults bear the mental costs, including social isolation resulting from inadequate rental housing. Detailed information about how this migrant group entered the private rental housing market, by taking over the rental leases of other Kiribati migrants vacating their rental properties, indicated some of the unintended consequences related to a lack of incentives for landlords to make improvements. With the most vulnerable families most at risk from inadequate housing, this research concludes {{that there is a need}} for minimum housing standards to protect tenants...|$|R
