The Philadelphia Inquirer gave a positive review of Beghe's performance in Monkey Shines: [...] "Acting only with his face and voice, Jason Beghe <b>is</b> <b>terrific</b> at conveying the mounting anger and rage of an active man made passive". David Foil of The Advocate described Beghe's performance as [...] "remarkable simply for meeting {{the demands of the}} character".|$|E
500|$|Kapoor next {{appeared}} in his father's directorial Mausam (2011); co-starring Sonam Kapoor, the star-crossed romance set over a decade, took two years to complete. Considering the film to be his [...] "dream project", Kapoor did not take on additional work while filming for it. For his role as an unambitious village boy who becomes an air force pilot, Kapoor trained to fly the F-16 Fighting Falcon. Rajeev Masand reviewed that [...] "while he doesn’t quite cut it as a convincing IAF pilot, Shahid Kapoor <b>is</b> <b>terrific</b> as the small-town brat". The film was a box office flop and Kapoor was later regretful for {{spending so much time}} on the project.|$|E

Cates explained his decision to hire Rock for the telecast in a press release saying, [...] "I am a huge fan of Chris Rock. He always makes me laugh and he always has something interesting to say. Chris represents the best of the new generation of comics. Having him host the Oscars <b>is</b> <b>terrific.</b> I can't wait."

500|$|Inside Man has {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes sampled 197 reviews, and currently has an 86% rating, making it [...] "Certified Fresh". The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "Spike Lee's energetic and clever bank-heist thriller {{is a smart}} genre film {{that is not only}} rewarding on its own terms, but manages to subvert its pulpy trappings with wit and skill -- and Denzel Washington <b>is</b> <b>terrific</b> as a brilliant hostage negotiator." [...] Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned Inside Man a weighted average score of 76 (out of 100) based on 39 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be [...] "generally favorable reviews". CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade cinemagoers gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] on an A+ to F scale, with exit polls showing that 54% of the audience was male, while 68% was at least 30 years old or older. The American Film Institute named Inside Man {{as one of the top}} ten films of 2006.|$|E
500|$|In the February 1991 {{edition of}} Electronic Learning, Robert McCarthy wrote: [...] "Teachers, {{educational}} administrators and software developers are {{enthusiastic about the}} new, lower cost Apple Macintosh computers". Steve Taffe, manager of instructional strategy at MECC, a developer and publisher of educational software, explained his excitement about the Classic: [...] " [...] <b>is</b> <b>terrific</b> – both because it's a Mac {{and because of that}} low price. Everyone can now afford a Macintosh." [...] Scholastic, an educational software developer, was also confident of Apple's ability to compete with MS-DOS machines, stating: [...] "They are just as cost-effective and as powerful as MS-DOS computers, but the Apples will have a superior comfort-level." [...] Sue Talley, Apple's manager of strategic planning in education, said of the Classic: [...] "we see it going into applications where you need a fair number of powerful stations, but where color is not a big issue." [...] Talley mentioned that it was most suited for writing labs and other basic productivity uses. Many schools decided not to buy the Macintosh Classic {{because of the lack of}} a color monitor, an option which the higher-priced Macintosh LC had. The popular Apple IIe Card also increased the LC's appeal to schools. Although the Classic was more popular at first, by May 1992 the LC (560,000 sold) was outselling the Classic (1.2 million).|$|E

500|$|When {{asked whether}} anti-US sentiments {{would affect the}} film's box office, Feige said, [...] "Marvel is {{perceived}} pretty well around the world right now, and I think putting another uber-Marvel hero into the worldwide box office {{would be a good}} thing.... We have to deal with {{much the same way that}} Captain America, when thawed from the Arctic ice, entered a world that he didn't recognize," [...] similar to the way Stan Lee and Jack Kirby reintroduced the character in the 1960s. Likewise, Arad noted, [...] "Captain America stands for freedom for all democracies, for hope all around the world. He was created to stop tyranny and the idea of stopping tyranny is important today as it was then. So I think that we will have some interesting challenges but at the end of the day if the movie <b>is</b> <b>terrific</b> and the movie talks to the world, it's not about one place, it's about the world and I think [...] that basis it will be very successful." [...] Later, after the election of US President Barack Obama, Feige commented, [...] "The idea of change and hope has permeated the country, regardless of politics, and that includes Hollywood. Discussions in all our development meetings include the zeitgeist and how it's changed in the last two weeks. Things are being adjusted".|$|E
500|$|Laura Fries of Variety {{commented on}} the {{difference}} between this series and Law & Order and : [...] "By scrutinizing motive and intent, Criminal Intent utilizes a more personal style that sets it apart from its brethren. Wolf's characters are notoriously devoid of detailed personal lives, but debut [...] hints at a little more introspection {{on the part of}} the characters". In Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker wrote that Law & Order: Criminal Intent was the best series of the year from the Law & Order franchise and that while Law & Order suffered from tired, wooden performances from actors with poor chemistry, the acting on Law & Order: Criminal Intent was at [...] "the other end of the spectrum." [...] Both writers {{commented on the}} overpowering screen presence that D'Onofrio commands in the first episode: [...] "Criminal Intent so far is a one-man show with Vincent D'Onofrio at its center. [...] commands the most attention, tending to overshadow Erbe, who is reduced in the pilot to following Goren with an awe-struck look," [...] wrote Fries, while Tucker also stated, [...] "D'Onofrio is so eccentrically entertaining, even his costar Kathryn Erbe seems fascinated", but complained that Erbe's role was smaller than D'Onofrio's, which [...] "jibes with the subtle range she showed on [...] Oz and proves her professional generosity." [...] He also said Sheridan [...] "is similarly nonplussed and under-utilized," [...] but [...] "Vance <b>is</b> <b>terrific</b> , who makes defendants wither in the face of his elegantly reasoned cross-examinations." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. In 2007, Patrick Enright of MSNBC called the episode his eighth {{favorite of the}} show. He praised the references to Terminator 2 in the episode, as well as Lisa's self-referential quote about how, [...] "by next week, we'll be {{back to where we}} started from, ready for another wacky adventure." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought the episode had [...] "some great existential musings" [...] from Lisa. They added that it also [...] "contains some nice moments highlighting the differences between the Simpsons and the Flanders." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said: [...] "I always remembered [...] to be a great episode – and I recalled correctly. Sure, the show goes with a less than creative presence; it’s an easy story to make characters behave in atypical ways. However, the development of the theme <b>is</b> <b>terrific,</b> as we learn the friendship of Homer Simpson is worse than the antagonism of Homer Simpson." [...] DVD Talk gave the episode a 4 out of 5 score. Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B grade, claiming the [...] "rather large dose of sentimentality" [...] and [...] "fewer moments of absurdity" [...] in the episode gave it [...] "the feeling that it belongs in one of the series' earlier seasons". The Orlando Sentinels Gregory Hardy named it the second best episode of the show with a sports theme.|$|E

Daniel J. Woods, a lawyer for Cox, described the lawsuit as frivolous. [...] "The Orange County Superior Court has already thrown out the libel claim, with good reason.

Woods said that Erhard would lose his case regarding the dismissed libel charges if he attempted to bring the matter up on appeal: [...] "Saying they are going to focus on an appeal for the libel claim is only a face-saving statement." ...|$|E

Sound engineer Neill King, who worked with Green Day on Dookie, noted that Tré Cool shares Moon's [...] "wild animal approach" [...] to playing drums, and explained that the band encountered difficulties while recording [...] "Basket Case" [...] due to his unpredictable style: [...] "It's not that Tré wasn’t a good drummer, {{but in terms of}} his performances we wanted the best of the best...So, although we wanted him to do all of his wild fills and crazy drumming, we couldn’t just let him go.

[...] In 2013, Time Out compiled a list of the 100 greatest horror films ever made based on the top ten lists of over one hundred film directors, screenwriters, and critics, and Inferno was listed as #92; in the resulting critical commentary for the film, Nigel Floyd wrote, [...] "Horror cinema at its most baroque: a simple libretto is embroidered with elaborate, flowing camera movements, abstract blocks of colour, unsettling sound effects and soundtrack composer Keith Emerson’s thunderous rock variations on Verdi...Argento’s best work is far behind him, but this alone justifies his cult reputation." ...|$|E
