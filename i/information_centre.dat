40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{regional}} integration of operations and <b>information</b> <b>centres</b> {{as a part of the}} Czech Republic Fire and Rescue Service (FRS). The regional fire-fighting rescue teams approached this issue independently, case-by-case, for both technical and human resources needs. The thesis is divided into several parts describing the regional integration activity at operations and <b>information</b> <b>centres</b> within the Czech Republic Fire and Rescue Service. It describes the basis of the regional integration of operations and <b>information</b> <b>centres,</b> legal regulations related to the regional integration activity at operations and <b>information</b> <b>centres</b> and explains some options for the integration operations and <b>information</b> <b>centres.</b> The thesis aims to scrutinize developing a methodology which can assist FRS in the integration of the existing operation and <b>information</b> <b>centres.</b> Such methodology might also serve as a framework for the integration of the police operation centres or emergency services throughout the Czech Republic...|$|R
40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{essential}} factors, which influence the satisfaction of the customers using services of the <b>information</b> <b>centres.</b> The main goal of the thesis is to identify these factors by means of primary research. The primary research is focused on both the domestic and the foreign visitors and reveals the demands, which determine the quality of services of <b>information</b> <b>centres.</b> Furthermore, {{the quality of the}} services, which were really provided to the customers by <b>information</b> <b>centres,</b> is evaluated within the thesis. The examined <b>information</b> <b>centres</b> are located in the Středočeský region including Prague, Liberec region and Pardubice region.

5|$|A {{somewhat}} controversial recent {{addition to}} Caversham was the opening, in October 2013, of Whakamana Cannabis Museum, New Zealand's first museum {{dedicated to the}} history of cannabis use. Cannabis, while still a criminalised drug in New Zealand, has moved some way towards grudging acceptance, at least as a subject for open discussion. The museum, run from a former residential house in David Street, is designed to be an <b>information</b> <b>centre</b> on aspects of the history and legislation surrounding the drug, and also a national centre for the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party, a minor single-issue political party.|$|E

The Bittern Trail is reached from the Grebe Trail by the footbridge over Hollow Brook. The grassy path is often waterlogged in winter, but there is a boardwalk over a short section. The trail runs along the east shore, visits an open bird hide and returns to the footbridge, making a 1-mile (1.5-kilometre) circuit. Bristol Water imposes conditions on visitors, particularly related to the areas where dogs are allowed.|$|E
5|$|Since 1999, {{the leading}} Hubble {{outreach}} group in Europe {{has been the}} Hubble European Space Agency <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> (HEIC). This office was established at the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility in Munich, Germany. HEIC's mission is to fulfill HST outreach and education tasks for the European Space Agency. The work is centered on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble results and images. These are often European in origin, and so increase awareness of both ESA's Hubble share (15%) and the contribution of European scientists to the observatory. ESA produces educational material, including a videocast series called Hubblecast designed to share world-class scientific news with the public.|$|E
