40|$|The Treaty of Amsterdam stipulated {{the fact}} that the European Union must {{maintain}} and develop an area of freedom, security and justice, freedom assuming the existence of a common judicial area in which European citizens are able to seek justice in any of the member state same as in their own country. This goal aims to eliminate the possibility that criminals exploit the differences between the legal systems of the member states, imposing that the judgments are recognized and enforced abroad without the formalities laid down by the classical conventions on international judicial assistance. The Council Framework Decision 2002 / 584 /JHA of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States, materialized the decision taken in Tampere, following that between EU Member States to be replace the <b>formal</b> <b>extradition</b> <b>procedure</b> of the people who evade the execution of a sentence of imprisonment imposed by a judgment of conviction became final, with a simplified surrender procedure. ...|$|E
40|$|The European Arrest Warrant (EAW) is {{the first}} and most {{important}} measure in the field of European criminal law for the purpose of implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions. The Framework Decision which introduced it was adopted on 13 June 2002 following point 35 of the Conclusions of the Tampere European Council of 15 - 16 October 1999 (aiming at abolishing the <b>formal</b> <b>extradition</b> <b>procedure</b> among the Member States of the European Union). The Warrant is a judicial decision issued by a Member State, which requires the arrest and surrender of a person by another Member State, for the purposes of conducting a criminal prosecution or executing a custodial sentence or detention order. It is issued when the person whose return is sought is accused of an offence for which the law establishes a maximum of at least one year in prison, or when the person has already been sentenced to a prison term of at least four months. The research aims at exploring {{the context in which the}} EAW was adopted, as part of the mutual recognition agenda. This will be done through an analysis of the substantive and procedural legal aspects of its implementation. Is mutual recognition correctly implemented? While some authors hail it as a giant leap towards a new system of inter-state judicial cooperation, others view it as a danger for the traditional principles of criminal law as developed in Europe in the last centuries. The thesis will look at the functioning of the EAW in the EU criminal law area and at its implications for national sovereignty as well as individual rights, with particular reference to the radical modification of the principles of classical extradition law. An evaluation of its effectiveness and its real importance will be carried out from both an international and a European law point of view.

50|$|Measures {{which sought}} to {{harmonise}} extradition rules across EU member states date from the mid-1990s when the EU instituted two treaties under the Maastricht Treaty {{which sought to}} streamline existing <b>extradition</b> <b>procedures</b> under the European Convention on Extradition. In 1999 the European Council further proposed to abolish <b>formal</b> <b>extradition</b> <b>procedures</b> for sentenced persons. However {{it was not until}} the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks in the United States that much more far reaching proposals were mooted. While originally proposed as an anti-terrorist measure the European Arrest Warrant soon became applicable to a wide range of ordinary crimes. The political decision to adopt the EAW legislation was made at the Laeken European Council in December 2001, the text being finally agreed in June of the following year.|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} {{at the main}} {{problems}} regarding the current application of EU <b>extradition</b> <b>procedures</b> {{in relation to the}} area of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. It introduces the ‘Europeanisation’ of <b>extradition</b> <b>procedures</b> through a discussion based on the continuity of the principle of mutual recognition from the EC Treaties to the EU Constitutional Treaty. The latest manifestation of this continuity is the introduction of the European Arrest Warrant (adopted on June 13, 20002) that is aimed to simplify the <b>extradition</b> <b>procedures</b> for suspected criminals within the territory of the European Union by creating a positive list of criminal areas. The author discusses the innovations introduced by the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant (abolition of the test of dual criminality) and then focuses on two main problem areas based on the reaction of certain Member States: i) Compatibility with Constitutional Guarantees: where the author notices a change of attitude in the national courts from being eager to contest the constitutionality of EU Arrest Warrant implementation law to being more pragmatic about authorising the extradition of their own nationals ii) Compatibility with Human Rights: where the author argues that the principle of mutual recognition is not adequate for adjudicating interstate criminal cases when it operates in isolation. He therefore proposes the enforcement of mutual trust or ‘full faith and credit’ accompanied by the standards of procedural rights set out in the ECHR and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{portrays the}} new European Union {{extradition}} system, {{established by the}} Framework Decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States of 2002. In the introductory remarks, the author explains the formation {{and development of the}} traditional <b>extradition</b> <b>procedure,</b> depicts relevant legal sources, and points to its flaws, which boil down to tardiness and inefficiency. The main author's standpoint is that the European arrest warrant is based on mutual trust in the member-states' legal systems, and that it depoliticizes the <b>extradition</b> <b>procedure</b> by transforming interstate cooperation into cooperation between member - states' law enforcement authorities. On these grounds, the author determines the nature of this new legal institute, that introduces radical changes into the paradigm of the classical extradition, and explains its main features as well as the scope of application. Further on, the paper explores the conditions for issuance of the European arrest warrant, which are proscribed by negative formulations - as absolute and relative obstacles for extradition. Finally, the author explains the standardized formal elements of the European arrest warrant content, which should make its application easier and more expeditious...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a very {{delicate}} subject – the extraordinary rendition. The analysis starts from the rendition to justice as a technique by which a suspected person is forcibly abducted in another State, if {{it is impossible to}} bring this suspect to stand trial by the normal <b>extradition</b> <b>procedure.</b> In these cases, the forcible abduction can be executed unilaterally by the agents of the forum State or with the cooperation of agents of the State where the person is abducted. The rendition in itself is not a judicial procedure because it lacks a judicial warrant and, in reality, is mostly a highly covert police or military operation, with the risk of infringing upon the State sovereignty of other States (depending on the cooperation with that State). Recently, the rendition to justice practice was applied in a systematic way in dealing with the prosecution of piracy in the Somalia-Gulf of Aden area. Several defendants ended up in criminal trials in European States without any <b>extradition</b> <b>procedure</b> at all. The rendition to justice was widened into a rendition to secure policy and in this way the extraordinary rendition was born. Extraordinary rendition is also a special administrative measure, but one that fundamentally changes the meaning of rendition, as the aim is no longer to adjudicate a person, but to keep him/her in secret detention for interrogation. In this context, the paper observes also the way extraordinary rendition is reflected in The Inter-American Court of Human Rights jurisprudence and in European Court of Human Rights standards...|$|R
40|$|The European Arrest Warrant was the {{necessary}} {{response to the}} increase in cross-border crime, which had been a result produced by the liquidation of the internal state boundary. Furthermore it represents a fully new system of judicial cooperation in criminal matters among the Member States of European Union, based on principle of mutual trust and on the principle of recognition of judicial decisions and judgments. At the first stage the thesis "Implementation of European Arrest Warrant" describes the historical events marking or directly leading the adoption of the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States by the Council of the European Union on 13 th June 2002. Then major differences between this new institute and its former legislation, <b>extradition</b> <b>procedures,</b> are being analyzed. The main part is being focused on problems that occurred during transposition of the named Framework decision into Member States' internal law systems, from time, content and constitutional compliance point of view while with this last the complications that Czech republic, Germany, Poland and Belgium faced are being described. Even though no doubts that the implementation of European Arrest Warrant encountered a lot of troubles we can not simply deny that it made enormously the whole process of surrender more easy and quicker which was absolutely needed in these times of increasing cross-border criminality and real danger of terrorism while the old <b>extradition</b> <b>procedures</b> were fully obsolete and too formal. The new European Arrest Warrant then represents a simple mandatory logical step forward...|$|R
