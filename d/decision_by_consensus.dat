While the role of a leading matriarch in an elephant herd is well known, studies have shown that some animal species use a consensus approach in their collective decision-making process.|$|E
50|$|Groups such as Oxfam {{have criticized}} the Uruguay Round for paying {{insufficient}} attention to {{the special needs of}} developing countries. One aspect of this criticism is that figures very close to rich country industries—such as former Cargill executive Dan Amstutz—had {{a major role in the}} drafting of Uruguay Round language on agriculture and other matters. As with the WTO in general, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as Health Gap and Global Trade Watch also criticize what was negotiated in the Round on intellectual property and industrial tariffs as setting up too many constraints on policy-making and human needs. An article asserts that the developing countries’ lack of experience in WTO negotiations and lack of knowledge of how the developing economies would be affected by what the industrial countries wanted in the WTO new areas; the intensified mercantilist attitude of the GATT/WTO’s major power, the US.; the structure of the WTO that made the GATT tradition of <b>decision</b> <b>by</b> <b>consensus</b> ineffective, so that a country would not preserve the status quo, were the reasons for this imbalance.|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS. CT examinations performed at the time of diagnosis in I 7 patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome were retrospectively evaluated by two observers who reached a <b>decision</b> <b>by</b> <b>consensus</b> about the presence and nature of parenchymal abnor-malities. High-resolution CT (I- to 3 -mni collimation) was performed in 14 patients and con-ventional CT (6 - to 10 -mm collimation) was perfornied in three cases. RESULTS. Predominant CT findings consisted of parenchymal opacification (consolidation or ground-glass attenuation) (ii = 10), pulmonary nodules (ii = 2). bronchial wall thickening or di-latation (ii = 2), interlobular septal thickening (ii = 1), and normal anatomy (,i = 2). Parenchymal opacification was predominantly peripheral (ii = 6) or random in distribution (ii = 4). CONCLUSION. The most common CT finding in patients with Churg-Strauss syn-drome consists of areas of parenchymal opacification that may be random or peripheral in distribution.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{high-resolution}} CT (HRCT) findings at presentation and after hospital admission in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). MATERIALS AND METHODS. We reviewed the HRCT findings at presentation (n = 12) and after hospital admission (n = 25) of 29 patients with SARS and compared the HRCT findings with the radiographic findings. HRCT scans were obtained using 1 -mm (n = 28) or 2 -mm (n = 1) collimation. The radiographs and HRCT scans were reviewed independently by two observers who reached a <b>decision</b> <b>by</b> <b>consensus,</b> RESULTS. All patients had abnormal findings on HRCT at presentation. Eight of these 12 patients had normal findings on radiographs. The predominant HRCT findings at presentation consisted of unilateral (n = 6) or bilateral (n = 2) ground-glass opacities or focal unilateral (n = 2) or bilateral (n = 2) areas of consolidation. All patients showed progression of disease on follow-up. The predominant HRCT findings on follow-up CT scans consisted of unilateral (n = 2) or bilateral ground-glass opacities (n = 13), unilateral (n = 2) or bilateral consolidation (n = 5), or a mixed bilateral pattern of ground-glass attenuation, consolidation, and reticulation (n = 3). Reticulation with associated architectural distortion and mild traction bronchiectasis was present in eight patients. CONCLUSION. HRCT can show parenchymal abnormalities in patients with SARS who have normal findings on radiographs at presentation. Follow-up CT scans obtained in hospitalized patients show findings consistent with fibrosis in a small percentage of patients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Background: This {{research}} uses collaborative governance {{concept to}} explicate efforts of HIV Health Services Planning Councils in Broward County and Palm Beach County of South Florida. The {{purpose is to}} accentuate how collaborative governance works in providing various categories of services {{to meet the needs}} of people with AIDS (PWAs), as part of the implementation of the Ryan White CARE Act. Methods: The study employs mixed methods: surveys, interviews, observations, and document reviews in generating data from various relevant sources of the Councils, from 2008 - 2009 and from 2013 - 2014. The garnered data from fifty-five (55) participants and other sources was subjected to descriptive and multivariate analysis and integration of themes and concepts based on category analysis. Results: The results reveal more similarities than differences between the Councils in their efforts toward addressing the HIV/AIDS problem. The Councils are similar in all variables of collaborative governance with few exceptions as it relates to facilitative leadership and institutional design. The differences relate to membership, number of committees, amount allocated for various service categories and number of clients served. Furthermore, the Councils are slightly different in reaching consensus on subjects of deliberation. On the average, Palm Beach County´s Council makes <b>decision</b> <b>by</b> <b>consensus</b> relatively easily when compared with Broward County´s Council. Conclusions: The combined findings based on quantitative and qualitative evidence are essential to knowledge and understanding of collaborative governance of the respective Councils. Collaborative governance involving state and non-state stakeholders enhances efforts of public managers by harnessing resources to effectively manage and/or address complex problems for the benefit of society. The representation and participation of target populations in collaborative governance contribute to the judicious allocation of resources for various service categories and the empowerment of target populations. The study contributes to the literature by developing a conceptual model for collaborative governance to help meet care and treatment needs of HIV infected and affected...|$|E
40|$|As {{more and}} more schools start school i m p rovement {{planning}} and schoolwide projects, they often face the question: “How do we make decisions? ” While this may seem a relatively simple question, {{it is in fact}} quite complex. In this issue of REFORM TALK we will look at three different approaches to decision making: voting, consensus, and decision making by leaders. We will examine the advantages and disadvantages to each approach and the situations that may influence what approach to select (See Yukl, 1989 and Scholtes, 1990). In considering what type of decision making to use, one should not be swayed by the rhetoric or hype—no one approach to decision making is best for all situations. Choosing the Approach to Decision Making What are the conditions that might influence the type of decision making to use? First, involvement of various people in decisions can have a positive impact both {{on the quality of the}} decision and on the commitment that people feel toward the decision. Research has pointed out that if people have a say in the decision, they are more likely to feel a sense of commitment to the decision. Second, involving those with some expertise in the area or interest in the decision can improve the quality and the support for the decision (Bolman and Deal, 1997). Third, decision making takes time. It is key to remember that different types of decision making require more time than others. The more people involved, the more time it will take. But, some decisions are less important. The school may leave these less important decisions up to a small group, the principal or department chair to save time. Other, more important decisions, may be given to committees or groups to consider. Be sure to take these various conditions into consideration when selecting what decision making approach to use. Types of Decision Making There are three main types of decision making. These include: voting, <b>decision</b> <b>by</b> <b>consensus,</b> and decision by leaders. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages. Voting. Making decisions through voting i...|$|E
