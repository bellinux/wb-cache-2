25|$|This tiny monkey, {{named for}} its {{beautiful}} golden colour and the long hair around its head which resembles a lion's mane, {{is one of the}} rarest primates in the world. <b>Golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins,</b> like many of the other tamarins found in South America, are threatened with extinction in their natural habitat. Dublin Zoo is involved in the international breeding programme and helps to fund researchers who study the tamarins in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Expanding {{knowledge}} about the needs of zoo animals and commitment to their well being has changed {{the look of the}} National Zoo. Today, animals live in natural groupings rather than individually. Rare and endangered species, such as <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins,</b> Sumatran tigers, and sarus cranes, breed and raise their young – showing the success of the zoo's conservation and research programs. The zoo's research team studies animals both in the wild and at the zoo. Its research encompasses reproductive biology, conservation biology, biodiversity monitoring, veterinary medicine, nutrition, behavior, ecology, and bird migration.|$|E
25|$|World of Birds, which {{originally}} {{opened in}} 1972, is an indoor bird house spanning two floors and featuring several walk-through aviaries. The building closed for repairs and upgrades {{in the summer}} of 2010, and reopened the following year. The exhibit has multiple educational displays focusing on deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade and their affects on wild bird populations. The most prominent residents of the exhibit include the maleos, a pair of Sanford's tarictic hornbills (Penelopides exarhatus sanfordi), green junglefowl, fawn-breasted bowerbirds, Cuban amazons, pink pigeons, Andean cocks-of-the-rock, plate-billed mountain toucans, Oriental pied hornbills, Abdim's storks, keas, three species of birds-of-paradise, a golden-headed quetzal, blue-billed curassows, white-throated bee-eaters, western capercaillies, white-fronted bee-eaters and common hoopoes. Emus can be found in an outdoor yard. <b>Golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins,</b> Bolivian grey titis, cotton-top tamarins, and red-footed tortoise make up the exhibit's non-bird species. In mid-2009, the zoo's hand-reared pair of great blue turacos successfully raised chicks, the first known instance of a hand-reared pair doing so. In March 2013, three maleo chicks hatched at the zoo, bringing their total number of birds to 12. The zoo, along with the WCS, works towards preserving this species in the wild as well.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> (Leontopithecus rosalia, mico-leão-dourado [...] ), {{also known}} as the golden marmoset, is a small New World monkey of the family Callitrichidae. Native to the Atlantic coastal forests of Brazil, the <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> is an {{endangered}} species with an estimated wild population of about 3,500 individuals spread between four places along southeastern Brazil, and a captive population maintained at about 490 individuals among 150 zoos.|$|R
2500|$|The {{majority}} of the zoo's smaller mammal species live in the Small Mammal House. The species on display include <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins,</b> golden-headed lion tamarins, [...] pale-headed saki monkeys, [...] Geoffroy's marmosets, [...] black howler monkeys, red-ruffed lemurs, black-footed ferrets, banded mongooses, dwarf mongooses, meerkats, a short-eared elephant shrew, [...] brush-tailed bettongs, striped skunks, [...] La Plata three-banded armadillos, screaming hairy armadillos, sand cats, fennec foxs, naked mole-rats, southern tamanduas, rock hyraxs and several others.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2010, Auckland Zoo {{opened the}} Tropics exhibit. [...] Following in the {{footsteps}} of Spanish explorers, visitors enter the Americas through the south eastern United States, where alligators roam the swamps and wetlands. [...] The path continues to the Tropics Treehouse, home to <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins,</b> pygmy marmosets and cotton top tamarins. [...] The tropics precinct provided a new home for the zoo's American alligator, 26-year-old, Doris. [...] Doris was joined later that month by four new females, all eight years old, named Dakota, Dixie, Tallulah and Georgia. In November 2010, male golden lion tamarin, Janeiro, arrived from Adelaide Zoo as a companion for the zoo's female, Gabrielle.|$|E
50|$|Secondly, in {{an effort}} to save the <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> from extinction, some of the <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> have been removed from small, {{isolated}} unsafe forests and placed into a larger, protected forest; specifically they were moved to União Biological Reserve and Poço das Antas reserve. This effort to move the <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> into União Biological Reserve in Brazil began in 1991. The <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> faced the potential of getting new diseases that they had not been previously exposed to. Many were exposed to callitrichid hepatitis, and contracted the disease.|$|E
50|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> has a diverse, {{omnivorous}} diet {{consisting of}} fruits, flowers, nectar, bird eggs, insects and small vertebrates. They rely on microhabitats for foraging and other daily activities and tamarins will use bromeliads, palm crowns, palm leaf sheaths, woody crevices, lianas, vine tangles, tree bark, rotten logs, and leaf litters. The <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> uses its fingers to extract prey from crevices, under leaves, and in dense growth; a behavior known as micromanipulation. It {{is made possible}} by elongated hands and fingers. Insects make up to 10-15% of its diet. Much of the rest is made of small, sweet, pulpy fruits. During the rainy season, the <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> mainly eats fruit, however during drier times, it must eat more of other foods like nectar and gums. Small vertebrates are also consumed more at these times as insects become less abundant.|$|R
50|$|The Kimelman Tiger Falls {{opened in}} 2000 and {{exhibits}} {{animals such as}} Malayan tiger, black howler monkey, Aldabra tortoise, <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin,</b> and Reeve's muntjac.|$|R
50|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> {{gets its}} name from its bright reddish orange pelage and the extra long hairs around the face and ears which give it a {{distinctive}} mane. Its face is dark and hairless. It is believed that the tamarin gets its hair color from sunlight and carotenoids in its food. The <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> is {{the largest of the}} callitrichines. It is typically around 261 mm and weighs around 620 g. There is almost no size difference between males and females. As with all New World monkeys, the <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> has tegulae, which are claw-like nails, instead of ungulae or flat nails found in all other primates, including humans. Tegulae enable tamarins to cling to the sides of tree trunks. It may also move quadrupedally along the small branches, whether through walking, running, leaping or bounding. This gives it a locomotion more similar to squirrels than primates.|$|R
50|$|The {{reserve is}} home to 77 known species of mammals. Currently, the mammal {{population}} is threatened due to many reasons such as wildfires and poaching.The reserve {{is famous for its}} <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> (Leontopithecus rosalia), which represent most part of the few remaining wild <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> in the world. There is estimated to be 1000 tamarins in the reserve and surrounding areas. Currently the Golden Lion Tamarin Conservation Project (GLTCP) is attempting to save the <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> from extinction.|$|E

50|$|Despite the {{challenge}} of illness, the forty-two translocated golden lion tamarins' population grew to over 200 in União Biological Reserve. The number of wild <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> is now up in the thousands in all reserves and ranches combined in Brazil. These numbers were once down in the 200s in 1991. By 2025, the number of <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> that are protected is projected to be greater than 2000.|$|E
50|$|In 1987, estrous {{synchrony}} {{was reported}} in female <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> by French and Stribley. Their subjects consisted of five adult female <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> that were housed in two groups. Two females were housed with adult males and three females (a mother and two daughters) were housed with an adult male and infant male. They reported a 2.11 day difference in peak cycle estrogen for the two groups, which was less than the 4.5 day difference that they calculated would be the difference based on <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> having a 19-day estrous cycle. Schank reanalyzed their study {{with the help of}} computer simulation and reported that a 2.11 day difference was not likely statistically significant. Monfort and colleagues conducted a study with eight females housed in pairs and found no evidence of synchrony.|$|E
5000|$|A {{study has}} shown that {{increased}} predation has caused significant decreases in the population numbers. A survey conducted in 1992 found the number of wild population of <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> to be 562 individuals in 109 groups. Currently, the average group size includes 3.6 to 5.7 individuals and densities from 0.39 groups/km to 2.35 groups/km. [...] These predatory attacks occur at the golden lion tamarin sleeping sites. The predators make those sleeping sites, which are mainly tree holes (about 63.6%), larger in order to attack the <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins,</b> sometimes wiping out the entire family. The preferred sleeping sites of most <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> are tree holes in living trees next to other larger trees with {{a small percentage of}} canopy cover. These sleeping sites not only provide a place for sleep, but also offer protection and easy access to foraging sites. Most of the tree holes are lower to the ground, so they are easier to enter. Tree holes that are located in living trees are drier, warmer, and have a lower number of insects and therefore a decreased percentage of transmitted diseases. A smaller percentage of canopy coverage allows the <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> to detect the predators faster, and being surrounded by other large trees allows them access to escape routes. Due to degradation of their habitats, there are fewer trees that can support entire social groups and some have to resort to using bamboo (17.5%), vine tangles (9.6%), and bromeliads (4.7%) as a sleeping site, making them more susceptible to predators. <b>Golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> are known to use different den sites, but do not change sites often. They are more likely to reuse secure sites that will offer protection. However, the disadvantage of doing so is that predators are able to learn where these sites are located. <b>Golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> also scent mark their den holes, so they can quickly return to them in the afternoon time when predators are most active. While excessive scent makes it easier for <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> to find their sleeping sites, it also helps predators locate their prey. Moreover, increased deforestation has decreased habitat space, providing predators easy access to their prey, causing a decline in the golden lion tamarin population.|$|E
