Lyrically, though the song {{appears to be}} about dancing and sex, in reality Madonna uses sarcasm to {{emphasize}} the longevity of her career.

Sometimes I try to make things harder for myself, just to try to make myself a bit more angry. I try out a few subconscious things I suppose, like conflicts with other people.

Faust, Thiessen, and others participated in selecting voice actors, and Hasbro gave final approval. The voice work is performed {{prior to the}} animation, with the animators in the room to help provide direction; according to Libman, this allows herself and the other actors to play the character without certain limitations. Libman noted that for recording her lines as the hyperactive Pinkie Pie, [...] "I learned that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> as over the top as I want and they [...] rarely pull me back." ...|$|E

The song builds into a crescendo as Madonna sings the line, [...] "If it's against the law, arrest me, if you can handle it, undress me". This is followed by synthesized musical arrangement, as Madonna starts singing the line, [...] "When the lights go down and there's no one left, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> on and on and on." [...] An interlude, where Madonna continuously chants the words [...] "Get Stupid", is also present. According to Miles Marshall Lewis of The Village Voice, the song contains elements of the work of Nile Rodgers.|$|E

Earnhardt clinched his 10th pole position during his career, with a time of 48.364seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Jeff Gordon.

After the massive commercial success of Nirvana's 1991 album Nevermind, Sub Pop recovered financially by receiving royalties from the album after the band left them for a major label. Dulli later said {{that while he was}} [...] "stranded in L.A. ... Nirvana saved the whole fuckin' label". He recalled thanking the band's frontman Kurt Cobain upon the album's completion, saying that [...] "I went to Nirvana's show at the Palace in L.A. and hugged Kurt and said, 'Good one, bro.

Many of the creative staff are on various social media services and directly interact with the fandom, including doing questions-and-answer sessions live during the broadcast of new episodes.

500|$|About casting, Singer said, [...] "You pick {{people not}} {{for what they}} are, but what you imagine they can turn into." [...] To {{research}} his role, Spacey met doctors and experts on cerebral palsy and talked with Singer about how it would fit dramatically in the film. They decided that it would affect only {{one side of his}} body. According to Byrne, the cast bonded quickly during rehearsals. Del Toro worked with Alan Shaterian to develop Fenster's distinctive, almost unintelligible speech patterns. According to the actor, the source of his character's unusual speech patterns came from the realization that [...] "the purpose of my character was to die." [...] Del Toro told Singer, [...] "It really doesn't matter what I say so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> really far out with this and really make it uncomprehensible." ...|$|E

They're super-artist-friendly. They let us make our record the way we wanted to make it. It's the best label we could be on." [...] In an interview with MTV Radio, Wade explained the message behind [...] "Sick Cycle Carousel" [...] and said, [...] "It's one of those songs I'm really afraid to put an explanation to as far as what it's about for me personally. I don't want it to lose its mystery and mystique. Everyone interprets it differently. It's funny hearing people telling what's it's about to them because then <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>go,</b> 'Maybe that's what it's about.' It's got a weird mystique to me still."

[...] He played in 36 of 38 Premier League matches, missing only the two matches against Liverpool due to the terms of his loan deal. Although he was unable to prevent Charlton from being relegated at the end of 2006–07, his outstanding form led him to be named as the Charlton Athletic Player of the Year, the first loan player ever to receive the award.|$|E
500|$|Despite Steiger's acclaim as an actor, he was {{frequently}} accused of overacting and won his {{fair share of}} critics, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. His acting was so dynamic at times that critics found him excessive and overbearing, and even uncomfortable or laughable to watch. Steiger once clashed with Armenian director Rouben Mamoulian, during a theatrical production of Oklahoma!, as he was intolerant of Steiger's [...] "unusual acting technique". Steiger ignored the director's concerns that he was mumbling his lines, and when he began chomping loudly on an apple during a scene with Gordon MacRae, Mamoulian exclaimed: [...] "Get out of my theater. Get out of my life!", and fired him. Even Kazan found several of the Actors Studio's techniques disagreeable, preferring [...] "more humor and verve and less self-indulgence, self-pity and self-awareness". Kazan felt that Steiger often displayed a competitive edge as an actor and tried to steal scenes from his co-stars. Steiger rejected these claims, insisting that he was merely [...] "trying to take the medium of acting to as far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>go,</b> and that why I sometimes go over the edge".|$|E

Cobain said, [...] "When I {{write a song}} the lyrics are the least important subject. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> through two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all". Cobain told Spin in 1993 that he [...] "didn't give a flying fuck" [...] what the lyrics on Bleach were about, figuring [...] "Let's just scream some negative lyrics {{and as long as}} they're not sexist and don't get too embarrassing it'll be okay", while the lyrics to Nevermind were taken from two years of poetry he had accumulated, which he cut up and chose lines he preferred from. In comparison, Cobain stated that the lyrics to In Utero were [...] "more focused, they're almost built on themes". Cobain didn't write necessarily in a linear fashion, instead relying on juxtapositions of contradictory images to convey emotions and ideas. Often in his lyrics, Cobain would present an idea then reject it; the songwriter explained, [...] "I'm such a nihilistic jerk half the time and other times I'm so vulnerable and sincere [...] like a mixture of both of them. That's how most people my age are".|$|E

You have to start taking a bit of responsibility. [...] your hormones start kicking in hardcore. So he’s definitely going through some stuff." [...] In another interview, he described Fenmore as [...] "trying to find his place in the world", saying: [...] "When Fen first came back, I think he was at a very vulnerable age and was trying to find his place in the world; just really figure out who he is.

Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone described [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] as a [...] "thumpy self-empowerment anthem". Mark Beech from Bloomberg Television complimented the track's [...] "insidious beats". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it [...] "a little careerism on the dance floor", for the line [...] "Give me a record and I'll break it". However, she criticised the [...] "Get stupid" [...] interlude, calling it [...] "plain stupid". Jon Pareles from The New York Times, and Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, compared the song with Rick James' [...] "Super Freak" [...] (1981). Mark Savage from BBC described the song as [...] "one of the [...] record's few out-and-out pop moments, featuring a cute, bouncy beat, and a sense of humour that has been missing from Madonna's music since her Dick Tracy days." [...] Tom Ewing of Pitchfork named the song as one of Hard Candys better tracks, possessing the album's [...] "most urgent tune", stating that Madonna sings the lyrics [...] "Show me a record and I'll break it/ <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> on and on" [...] over [...] "hard-pushing electro-ska whose keyboards break up trying to keep pace." ...|$|E
500|$|Olajuwon has {{referred}} to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: [...] "When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is {{waiting for me to}} come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake.
