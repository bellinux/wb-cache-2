50|$|The term Lehman Wave {{refers to}} an economy-wide <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> and {{economic}} activity, with a wavelength of between 12 and 18 months, driven by a sudden major disruption of the economic system. The Lehman Wave is a damped, wave-like fluctuation around equilibrium. The amplitude of the Lehman Wave is larger for a business that is further away from its end market than for a business that is closer to its end market, which difference is caused by cumulative de-stocking of the intermediate supply chain. This term Lehman Wave has first been used by Dutch researchers in 2009 who gave that name to the economic wave that started in September 2008. They argue that the latter was caused by global de-stocking after the financial panic following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008. The Lehman Wave can have strong effects on the sales volume and therefore on the profitability of companies that are located upstream in the supply chain.|$|E

High production season, or on season is around June- August, while off season period is in December – January. <b>Fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> {{makes it difficult to}} reach modern market that required for continuous supply. There is also a big demand for this fruit for local markets, in particular during festive celebration. It is therefore an urgent need to provide continuous supply of the fruit. Physiological manipulation of flowering in citrus is necessary, so that the balance of supply and demand of citrus fruit in the longer time span can be obtained. Theaim of this research was to study the physiology of flowering in citrus in an effort to obtain citrus fruit out of season.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Industrial & Manufacturing Systems EngineeringChih-Hang John WuQuality is {{a result}} of product design and {{production}} control. Product design must maximize the ability to function across variations in production and environment. Production control must monitor and maintain the key design characteristics necessary for the intended function. Failure to do so results in premature part failure and increased costs. This has occurred in the production of modern cross ties. By designing quality into the product and production process, performance is maximized. This research presents a methodology for incorporating quality into the product design and production process. For product design, a relationship between product performance and design parameters is established by modeling techniques. These models provide a means to redesign the product to maximize performance and to understand the sensitivity of the design to <b>fluctuation</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> and environment. These models also establish the key design parameters that are critical for sustaining quality. For production, a method of monitoring the key design parameters is presented that provides an affordable means of automated inspection. Automated inspection removes operator error from the inspection process and allows for greater sampling rates to be achieved. The methodology presented allows for a potential of 100 % inspection to be achieved with minimal impact to production costs. The research is applied to the analysis and quality control of pre-stressing steel reinforcement for concrete cross-ties. This application provides an opportunity to test and verify the research findings on a real world problem. Novel automated 3 D spatial analysis algorithms are presented. This research furthers {{the state of the art}} of performing Geometrical Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T).

40|$|Managers often {{engage in}} {{forecast}} updating {{with the expectation}} that forecast updating reduces expected shortage and inventory costs. One undesirable effect of forecast updating is that it may lead to the bullwhip effect, a phenomenon where the variability of demand increases as one moves up the supply chain. The bullwhip effect can be undesirable for the supplier because more volatile orders from the downstream stage can be very costly to the supplier. It can {{make it more difficult for}} the supplier to forecast demand, and it can lead to large <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> supplier <b>production</b> levels from period to period. Using "stale" or old forecasts may sound foolish, but their judicious use in a two-stage supply chain can improve fulfillment from the upstream stage to the downstream stage and reduce the <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> levels. We study a two-stage supply chain where the demand process is nonstationary and both stages use an adaptive base stock policy. We propose a policy that uses old forecasts to set base stock levels at the downstream stage while using current forecasts to communicate upcoming orders from the downstream stage to the upstream stage. We study a decentralized supply chain setting, and we find that our policy can reduce the expected supply chain inventory and shortage costs and significantly reduce the <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> levels compared to that of using current information. We also study a cooperative supply chain setting and, surprisingly, we find in numerical examples that our proposed policy results in very small increases in the expected systemwide inventory and shortage costs compared to a systemwide optimal policy, while reducing the <b>fluctuations</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> levels. inventory control, forecasting, forecast revision, bullwhip effect, production smoothing...|$|R
