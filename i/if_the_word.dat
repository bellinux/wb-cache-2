25|$|Although the Unruh {{effect would}} {{initially}} {{be perceived as}} counter-intuitive, it makes sense <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> vacuum is interpreted in a specific way.|$|E
25|$|Compounds {{should be}} read as if each word were spelled separately, and they may {{therefore}} appear to violate the normal rules. That may sometimes cause confusion <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> is not {{known to be a}} compound.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> form is monosyllabic {{and ends}} in a consonant, a non-phonemic weakly voiced or {{unvoiced}} vowel is pronounced after the final consonant. This vowel is e-colored if suprasegmental palatalization is present, but a-colored if not.|$|E

25|$|Hyphenation {{at the end}} of a line {{depends on}} whether there is an easily {{recognizable}} word boundary there. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> is not a compound (or it is, but the boundary is not nearby) the word is hyphenated by syllables, otherwise by word elements (e.g. vas-√∫t ‚Äòrailway‚Äô, lit. ‚Äòiron-road,‚Äô instead of *va-s√∫t).|$|E
25|$|Subordinated clause {{elements}} take no comma (e.g. fekete szem√ºveges f√©rfi ‚Äòa {{man with}} black glasses‚Äô ‚Äì the word fekete ‚Äòblack‚Äô doesn‚Äôt belong to f√©rfi ‚Äòman‚Äô but to szem√ºveg ‚Äòglasses‚Äô). <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> mint ‚Äòas‚Äô precedes a phrase expressing status or quality, no comma is used before it (e.g. B√°ty√°mat mint tan√∫t hallgatt√°k ki. ‚ÄòMy brother was heard as a witness.‚Äô) Structures formed with an adverbial participle {{are not usually}} separated from the clause with a comma, especially if the participle is directly connected to it. However, if this part is loosely attached to the clause (especially if the participle has its own complement), it is recommended to use a comma.|$|E
25|$|Suffixes {{are added}} {{directly}} in most cases. The -i suffix is omitted in writing <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> already {{ends in the}} letter i (e.g. Stockholm > stockholmi, Helsinki > helsinki). With suffixes of variable forms depending on vowel harmony, the version {{in accordance with the}} actual pronunciation should be used. If a certain suffix requires lengthening of the word-final vowels a, e, o, √∂, it will be done as usual, e.g. Oslo but Osl√≥ban, osl√≥i. In addition, suffixes will follow the pronunciation of the word in terms of the ending consonant and the front or back vowels (e.g. Bachhal ‚Äòwith Bach‚Äô, Greenwichcsel ‚Äòwith Greenwich‚Äô).|$|E

25|$|The {{form of an}} Interlingua word is {{considered}} an international prototype {{with respect to the}} other words. On the one hand, it should be neutral, free from characteristics peculiar to one language. On the other hand, it should maximally capture the characteristics common to all contributing languages. As a result, it can be transformed into any of the contributing variants using only these language-specific characteristics. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> has any derivatives that occur in the source languages with appropriate parallel meanings, then their morphological connection must remain intact; for example, the Interlingua word for 'time' is spelled tempore and not *tempus or *tempo in order to match it with its derived adjectives, such as temporal.|$|E
500|$|More recent surveys, {{rather than}} {{addressing}} the larger issue, have targeted {{the controversy over}} the name of the Washington Redskins, asking <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> is offensive or if it should be changed. By a large majority (71‚Äì89 percent), public opinion has maintained that the name should not change. However, more than half (53‚Äì59 percent) agree that [...] "redskin" [...] is not an appropriate term for Native Americans.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{the lack}} of a schwa, the author must write the sound that would be used <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> was stressed. For example, the word enough is {{commonly}} pronounced , but when it is stressed (as in a declaration of irritation) it is pronounced [...] The Deseret spelling of the word, êê®êëåêê≤êëÅ, reflects that stressed pronunciation. If [...] does not have an inherent stressed value in a word, {{as is often the case}} before , then it is written as êê≤.|$|E

50|$|Generally, {{prima facie}} {{must be given}} {{as a general rule}} of {{statutory}} interpretation. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> are clear and free from ambiguity {{there is no need to}} refer to other means of interpretation. However, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> in <b>the</b> statute are vague and ambiguous, then internal aid may be consulted for interpretation. This means the statute should be read in whole, what is not clear in one section may be explained in another section.|$|R

One of the animators, Tom Sito, has stated that the letters spell [...] "SFX" [...] (a common abbreviation for [...] "special effects"), not with an [...] "E" [...] instead of the [...] "F", and were intended as an innocent [...] "signature" [...] created by the effects animation team.|$|E
500|$|Rabbits {{have long}} been {{associated}} with bad luck on Portland; use of the name is still taboo‚Äîthe creatures are {{often referred to as}} [...] "underground mutton", [...] "long-eared furry things" [...] or just [...] "bunnies". The origin of this superstition is obscure (there is no record of it before the 1920s) but it is believed to derive from quarry workers: they would see rabbits emerging from their burrows immediately before a rock fall and blame them for increasing the risk of dangerous, sometimes deadly, landslides. If a rabbit was seen in a quarry, the workers would pack up and go home for the day, until the safety of the area had been assured. Local fishermen too would refuse to go to sea <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> was mentioned.|$|E
500|$|In the {{correspondence}} between the two men, Hoffecker gave Rovelstad a number of tips {{about how to deal}} with Congress. [...] Even though the bill was still mired in committee, Hoffecker advised what to do once the bill was signed. [...] He did not know yet that Rovelstad was a sculptor, and wrote to him in September 1935 about the models to be submitted for approval, [...] "These should also be 10 [...] in diameter, and this is where your trouble commences. These sculptors all want to incorporate their own ideas in the design and ask anywhere from $400.00 to $1,000.00 for their work, telling you what trouble it is to get the approval of the Commission of Fine Arts and many other things which do not exist." [...] Hoffecker also offered to handle the issue for the committee; he proposed to advance the money necessary to purchase the new coins from the government and to handle the distribution. [...] He stated that he had enjoyed the distribution of the Old Spanish Trail piece, though he lied to Rovelstad, stating he was not a coin dealer‚Äîthe letterhead that Hoffecker used to write to Rovelstad said [...] "Loans and Mortgages" [...] under his name.

2500|$|A key {{property}} {{of a formal}} language {{is the level of}} difficulty required to decide whether a given word is in the language. [...] Some coding system must be developed to allow a computable function to take an arbitrary word in the language as input; this is usually considered routine. [...] A language is called computable (synonyms: recursive, decidable) if there is a computable function [...] such that for each word [...] over the alphabet, [...] <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> is in the language and [...] <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> is not in the language. Thus a language is computable just in case there is a procedure that is able to correctly tell whether arbitrary words are in the language.|$|E
