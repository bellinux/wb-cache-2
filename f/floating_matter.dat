Everything in the nature of gravel and sand is laid down within a very few miles of land, only the finer muddy sediments being carried out for 20 or 50 miles, and the very finest of all, under the most favourable conditions, rarely extending beyond 150, or at the utmost, 300 miles from land into the deep ocean.[164] Beyond these distances, and covering the entire ocean floor, are various oozes formed wholly from the debris of marine organisms; while intermingled with these are found various volcanic products which have been either carried through the air or floated on the surface, and a small but perfectly recognisable quantity of meteoric matter. Ice-borne rocks are also found abundantly scattered over the ocean bottom within a definite distance of the arctic and antarctic circles, clearly marking out the limit of floating icebergs in recent geological times.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in dynamical systems theory have revealed long-lived and coherent Lagrangian (i. e., material) eddies in incompressible, satellite-derived surface ocean velocity fields.

Here we show that inclusion of inertial effects (i. e., those produced by the buoyancy and size finiteness of an object) in a rotating two-dimensional incompressible flow context resolves this paradox. Specifically, we obtain that anticyclonic coherent Lagrangian eddies attract (repel) negatively (positively) buoyant finite-size particles, while cyclonic coherent Lagrangian eddies attract (repel) positively (negatively) buoyant finite-size particles.

The Mediterranean Sea is strongly affected by the presence of floating litter, as it has a very high amount of waste generated annually per person that eventually ends up in its waters, with plastic objects accounting for a large percentage of all man made debris. In principle, the basin looks very vulnerable to possible accumulation of floating debris, since its dynamics is characterized by an inward surface flow of water from the Atlantic hampering surface floating items from being flushed out. Yet, no evidence of permanent litter accumulation areas has been reported so far in the Mediterranean. In this paper we utilized the largest available set of historical Lagrangian data gathered in the Mediterranean Sea to estimate the probability of debris particles to reach different subareas of the basin, with the main objective of singling out possible retention areas.

Corresponding mean alongshore velocities are less well predicted with errors on the order of 10 cm/s for the most offshore sensors. Model calculations of very low frequency motions (VLFs) with O(10) min timescales typically explain over 60 % of the observed variability, both inside and outside of the surf zone.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of free surface vortices {{has been a}} major source of problems in different kinds of hydraulic intakes. Strong free surface vortices have a tendency to introduce swirl, <b>floating</b> <b>matter</b> and air into the intake, all of which are considered more or less harmful for intake and its subsequent structure operation. Formation and strength of free surface vortices can be minimised by proper design of the intake and/or using vortex suppressors. Intake submergence being the main governing factor in free surface vortex formation, it is chosen as the main design factor in vortex-free intake design. The free surface vortex formation at a hydraulic intake and subsequently its strength and position are, however, also highly influenced by the shape of the surrounding boundaries and approach flow conditions. As these properties always vary with each different installation sites, it is necessary to test the proposed designs thoroughly, even though they had been created according to the design criteria. The testing has to be done with properly scaled hydraulic models, as the geometries at the intake sites tend to be so complex that it is not possible or cost-effective to use computational methods. In this study, the formation of free surface vortex and the affecting factors on its strength were studied at spillway intakes of 1 : 100 hydraulic scale model of Xiluodu hydropower dam. The findings presented in this thesis reflect the true behaviour of vortices in the prototype. Data collection was done using particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) on the free surface flow field around the spillway intakes of the dam. The surface flow field data produced by the PTV system was interpolated, and the obtained full flow fields were analysed according to the Helmholtz vortex theorems and Rankine combined vortex theory principles: velocities around irregularly shaped vortices were averaged and the circulation strengths were calculated according to the theory. The shape of the intake surroundings was found to be a highly affecting factor in the vortex formation, mainly affecting the local approach flow condition, {{which is one of the}} main governing factors in vortex formation, and vortex pinning position, which determines the length of the vortex core and simultaneously affects the strength of the vortex. By changing the discharge inside the spillways with control gates and using only one of the each contiguous spillways, was found to be a way to control vortex formation. During the flood peak conditions it is not possible to avoid harmful vortices, and when compared to vortex-free intake design criteria, it is not possible to avoid harmful vortices even with higher intake submergences. However this kind of conditions occur very seldom, which may not be so harmful for the structures as they have withstand the conditions only for short time periods. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

These examples really constitute crucial tests, because, of all classes of animals, mammalia are least able to surmount physical barriers. They are obviously unable to pass over wide arms of the sea, while the necessity for constant supplies of food and water renders sandy deserts or snow-clad plains equally impassable. Then, again, the peculiar kinds of food on which alone many of them can subsist, and their liability to the attacks of other animals, put a further check upon their migrations. In these respects almost all other organisms have great advantages over mammals. Birds can often fly long distances, and can thus cross arms of the sea, deserts, or mountain ranges; insects not only fly, but are frequently carried great distances by gales of wind, as shown by the numerous cases of their visits to ships hundreds of miles from land. Reptiles, though slow of movement, have advantages in their greater capacity for enduring hunger or thirst, their power of resisting cold or drought in a state of torpidity, and they have also some facilities for migration across the sea by means of their eggs, which may be conveyed in crevices of timber or among masses of <b>floating</b> vegetable <b>matter.</b> And when we come to the vegetable kingdom, the means of transport are at their maximum, numbers of seeds having special adaptations for being carried by mammalia or birds, and for floating in the water, or through the air, while many are so small and so light that there is practically no limit to the distances they may be carried by gales and hurricanes.|$|R

[...] Parliament responded with the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1897, which created a new category of preferential creditors - at the time, employees and the tax authorities - who would be able to collect their debts after fixed charge holders, but before floating charge holders. In interpreting the scope of a floating charge the leading case was Re Yorkshire Woolcombers Association Ltd where a receiver contended an instrument was void because it had not been registered. Romer LJ agreed, and held that the hallmarks of a floating charge were that (1) assets were charged present and future and (2) change in the ordinary course of business, and most importantly (3) until a step is taken by the charge holder [...] "the company may carry on its business in the ordinary way". A floating charge is not, technically speaking, a true security until a date of its [...] "crystallisation", when it metaphorically descends and [...] "fixes" [...] onto the assets in a business' possession at that time.|$|R
6000|$|Assume a {{spheroid}} of such size as {{will form}} {{one of the}} inferior planets, and consisting externally of a voluminous, cloudy atmosphere composed of the less condensible elements, and internally of metallic gases: such internal gases being kept by convection-currents at temperatures not very widely differing. And assume that continuous radiation has brought the internal mass of metallic gases down to the critical point of the most condensible. May we not {{say that there is}} a size of the spheroid such that the pressure will not be great enough to produce liquefaction at any other place than the centre? or, in other words, that in the process of decreasing temperature and increasing pressure, the centre will be the place at which the combined conditions of pressure and temperature will be first reached? If so, liquefaction, commencing at the centre, will spread thence to the periphery; and, in virtue of the law that solids have higher melting points under pressure than when free, it may be that solidification will similarly, at a later stage, begin at the centre and progress outwards: eventually producing, in that case, a state such as Sir William Thomson alleges exists in the Earth. But now suppose that instead of such a spheroid, we assume one of, say, twenty or thirty times the mass; what will then happen? Notwithstanding convection-currents, the temperature at the centre must always be higher than elsewhere; and in the process of cooling the [...] "critical point" [...] of temperature will sooner be reached in the outer parts. Though the requisite pressure will not exist near the surface, there is evidently, in a large spheroid, a depth below the surface at which the pressure will be great enough, if the temperature is sufficiently low. Hence it is inferable that somewhere between centre and surface in the supposed larger spheroid, there will arise that state described by Prof. Andrews, in which [...] "flickering striæ" [...] of liquid <b>float</b> in gaseous <b>matter</b> of equal density. And it may be inferred that gradually, as the process goes on, these striæ will become more abundant while the gaseous interspaces diminish; until, eventually, the liquid becomes continuous. Thus there will result a molten shell containing a gaseous nucleus equally dense with itself at their surface of contact and more dense at the centre--a molten shell which will slowly thicken by additions to both exterior and interior.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was just}} saying that people are so like their boots," [...] said Miss Allan. Mrs. Paley did not hear. She {{repeated}} it more loudly still. Mrs. Paley did not hear. She repeated it a third time. Mrs. Paley heard, {{but she did not}} understand. She was apparently about to repeat it for the fourth time, when Rachel suddenly said something inarticulate, and disappeared down the corridor. This misunderstanding, which involved a complete block in the passage, seemed to her unbearable. She walked quickly and blindly in the opposite direction, and found herself {{at the end of a}} cul de sac. There was a window, and a table and a chair in the window, and upon the table stood a rusty inkstand, an ashtray, an old copy of a French newspaper, and a pen with a broken nib. Rachel sat down, as if to study the French newspaper, but a tear fell on the blurred French print, raising a soft blot. She lifted her head sharply, exclaiming aloud, [...] "It's intolerable!" [...] Looking out of the window with eyes that would have seen nothing even had they not been dazed by tears, she indulged herself at last in violent abuse of the entire day. It had been miserable from start to finish; first, the service in the chapel; then luncheon; then Evelyn; then Miss Allan; then old Mrs. Paley blocking up the passage. All day long she had been tantalized and put off. She had now reached one of those eminences, the result of some crisis, from which the world is finally displayed in its true proportions. She disliked the look of it immensely--churches, politicians, misfits, and huge impostures--men like Mr. Dalloway, men like Mr. Bax, Evelyn and her chatter, Mrs. Paley blocking up the passage. Meanwhile the steady beat of her own pulse represented the hot current of feeling that ran down beneath; beating, struggling, fretting. For the time, her own body was the source of all the life in the world, which tried to burst forth here--there--and was repressed now by Mr. Bax, now by Evelyn, now by the imposition of ponderous stupidity, the weight of the entire world. Thus tormented, she would twist her hands together, for all things were wrong, all people stupid. Vaguely seeing that there were people down in the garden beneath she represented them as aimless masses of <b>matter,</b> <b>floating</b> hither and thither, without aim except to impede her. What were they doing, those other people in the world? ...|$|R
