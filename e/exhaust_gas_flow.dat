40|$|The {{usage of}} OPEFB biomass as an {{alternative}} source for renewable energy such as biochar has a great potential to overcome the shortage of fossil fuel. Moreover, the utilization of biomass {{as a source of}} biofuel can reduce the problem of environmental pollution particularly on the issues related to greenhouse gases. Being the second largest oil palm producer in the world, Malaysia has a great potential to produce clean renewable energy from biomass. The selfsustained carbonization was proposed and tested in this study, whereby oil palm biomass itself was combusted to provide heat for self-carbonization in inadequate oxygen without electrical heating element. In the first chapter, the reviews on the literature pertaining Malaysia palm oil industry, current carbonization technologies, proposed self-sustained carbonization to produce biochar and the objectives of this study have been discussed. In the second chapter, the temperature profiles and gaseous emission concentration during self-sustained carbonization of empty fruit bunch biomass in a pilot scale reactor (30 kg capacity) at different particles sizes (100 - 150, 30 - 99 and less than 29 mm) was evaluated. For self-sustained carbonization with natural <b>exhausted</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> rate, the maximum temperatures ranging 417 - 580 oC at all particle sizes were tested and found to be suitable for biochar production. The average concentration of CO 2, CO and CH 4 released during the carbonization process were between 2. 8 - 4. 1, 0. 38 - 0. 51 and 0. 17 - 0. 26 %, respectively. For self-sustained carbonization with fixed <b>exhausted</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> rate, the maximum temperatures were slightly similar when compared to self-sustained carbonization with natural <b>exhausted</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> rate which was between 493 - 564 oC at all particle size tested. The average concentration of CO 2, CO and CH 4 released during the carbonization process were between 3. 65 - 5. 59, 0. 56 - 0. 72 and 0. 29 - 0. 39 %, respectively. SO 2 and HCl were not detected while NOx and particulate matter, (PM 10) were well below permitted level set by the Department of Environment, Malaysia for both natural and fixed <b>exhausted</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> rate. Gaseous pollutant in this study can be considered low and the self-sustained carbonization process was environmental friendly when compared to other studies using same palm oil biomass carbonization. In the third chapter, the effect of <b>exhausted</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> rate and OPEFB biomass particle sizes on biochar yield and quality in a pilot scale (30 kg capacity) reactor under self-sustained carbonization were evaluated. For self-sustained carbonization with natural <b>exhausted</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> rate, harvesting carbonization temperature of < 500 oC of OPEFB biomass at the particle size ranging from 100 - 150 mm produced the highest biochar yield and CV between 23 - 25 % and 22. 6 - 24. 7 MJ/kg, respectively. The carbonization retention time was between 790 - 893 min and less compared to other particle sizes tested. This particle size, without further size reduction, is needed to reduce the energy requirement at production line. For self-sustained carbonization temperature with fixed <b>exhausted</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> rate, the OPEFB biochar yield at particle size 100 - 150 mm produced the highest yield (25 - 27 %), harvested at carbonization temperature of < 500 oC compared to other particle sizes in the same condition. Moreover, this yield was also high as compared to self-sustained carbonization with natural <b>exhausted</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> rate. The CV were found between 23. 0 - 24. 4 MJ/kg which were also comparable with other studies. The carbonization retention time between 280 - 462 min were found less when compared to natural <b>exhausted</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> rate which contributed to high yield. More consistent result can be achieved under self-sustained carbonization temperature with fixed <b>exhausted</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> rate but energy required from the usage of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> blower. In this study, as the carbonization harvesting temperature decreased, the biochar yield decreases, the carbonization retention time increased. In the fourth chapter, self-sustained carbonization of pressed-shredded and whole bunchOPEFB in large scale pool type reactor (3000 kg) from the development of YAMASEN oven (Shimane) were successfully adopted and tested. The pressed-shredded OPEFB was found suitable to be carried out under an open carbonization system while closed carbonization system was preferable for whole bunch OPEFB. The maximum self-sustained carbonization temperature were ranged 583 - 695 oC for pressed-shredded and bunch OPEFB biomass. In terms of CV, large scale biochar production for open and closed system under self-sustained carbonization produced in between 21. 9 - 24. 3 and 19. 6 - 22. 9 MJ/kg, respectively which is comparable to small scale biochar production. In the fifth chapter, the energy balance and potential energy saving of raw and biocharOPEFB (pressed-shredded and whole bunch) in a scaled-up pool type self-sustained carbonization reactor (3 tones capacity) was evaluated. The ratio energy output/input for pressedshredded biochar, whole bunch biochar and raw pressed-shredded OPEFB briquette were positive which were 12, 15 and 8 respectively. Whole bunch biochar is still the highest ratio energy output/input biochar production although without pressed-shredder machine process step resulting in more energy produced than energy consumed. Briquetting raw pressed-shredded without carbonization process step also showed viable energy produced, however drying step with moisture below than 10 % is required. In conclusion and remarks, the self-sustained carbonization was successfully materialized, producing high yield and comparable CV in a small scale followed by scaling-up production of OPEFB biochar. This proposed system is preferable to the industry due to its simplicity, ease of operation and low energy requirement. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:生工博甲第 236 号 学位授与年月日:平成 27 年 3 月 25 日 1.

50|$|An Electric Turbo Compound (ETC) {{system is}} defined where a turbine coupled to a {{generator}} (turbogenerator) {{is located in}} the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> of a reciprocating engine to harvest waste heat energy and convert it into electrical power.|$|E
50|$|This type of {{exhaust system}} {{provides}} a significant mechanical advantage by creating low back pressure at the engine’s exhaust valves. Lower back pressure {{can improve the}} engine performance by optimising the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> characteristics, decreasing turbulence and mixing, thereby transmitting higher torque at mid-range rpm.|$|E
50|$|As {{the engine}} rpm increases, back {{pressure}} rises abruptly, generating higher turbulence and degrading <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> characteristics. Exhaust gases face restriction in being expelled, and contaminate the fresh air/charge {{drawn into the}} cylinder on the next stroke. Hence, there is a reduction in power and engine performance at higher rpm.|$|E

With common firing order 1-3-4-2, two scrolls of unequal length pair cylinders 1-4 and 3-2.

This allows for shorter nozzles than the standard design whilst maintaining nozzle expansion ratios. Because of the atmospheric boundary, the atmospheric pressure affects the exit area ratio so that atmospheric compensation can be obtained up to the geometric maximum allowed by the specific nozzle.|$|R

5000|$|Sequential {{turbocharger}} systems {{provide a}} way to decrease turbo lag without compromising ultimate boost output and engine power. Perhaps the most noteworthy application of this system is the fourth-generation Toyota Supra (1993-1998), which is generally regarded as having the most reliable sequential turbo system yet fitted to a production automobile, with a reported failure rate of less than 1% as of 2011. Other examples of cars with a sequential twin-turbo setup include the 1986-1988 Porsche 959, the 1990-1995 Eunos Cosmo JC, 1992-2002 Mazda RX-7 FD3S Turbo (13B-REW engine), the 1994-2005 JDM Subaru Legacy GT, GT-B & B4 RSK (EJ20TT engine), and the Peugeot 407 2.2 HDi. GM has filed a patent for a sequential twin-turbo system that uses a new bypass valve design said to optimize exhaust flow to the turbines of both turbochargers. [...] According to the 2016 patent description, the exhaust manifold features two outlets with one directing exhaust gases to the turbine of the high-pressure turbocharger, while the second exhaust manifold outlet directs exhaust gases to the turbine of the low-pressure turbocharger via a connecting channel. Additionally, exhaust gas exiting the high-pressure turbine is directed to the inlet of the low-pressure turbine. The new bypass system features two throttle valves located on the same spindle mounted perpendicular to each other. With the throttle valves mounted on the same plane, one valve opens to direct <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> {{to one of the}} turbochargers while the other valves simultaneously blocks <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> to the other turbocharger. The vehicle ECU (electronic control unit) sends a signal to the spindle’s actuator to rotate the throttle valves based on rpm and load. GM says the new design allows engineers to optimize <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> to both turbines without the compromises of traditional sequential turbocharger systems. Additionally, the system could utilize a variable-geometry turbine or a fixed-geometry turbine on the high-pressure turbo.|$|E

50|$|A {{regenerator}} {{consists of}} a brick checkerwork: bricks laid with spaces equivalent to a brick's width between them, so that air can flow relatively easily through the checkerwork. The idea is that as hot <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> <b>flow</b> through the checkerwork, they give up heat to the bricks. The airflow is then reversed, so that the hot bricks heat up the incoming combustion air and fuel. For a glass-melting furnace, a regenerator sits {{on either side of}} the furnace, often forming an integral whole. For a blast furnace, the regenerators (commonly called Cowper stoves) sit separate to the furnace. A furnace needs no less than two stoves, but may have three. One of the stoves is 'on gas', receiving hot gases from the furnace top and heating the checkerwork inside, whilst the other is 'on blast', receiving cold air from the blowers, heating it and passing it to the blast furnace.|$|R

50|$|The {{second most}} popular filter {{material}} is silicon carbide, or SiC. It {{has a higher}} (2700 °C) melting point than cordierite, however {{it is not as}} stable thermally, making packaging an issue.

SiC cores are usually more expensive than cordierite cores, however they are manufactured in similar sizes, and one can often be used to replace the other.Silicon carbide filter cores also look like catalytic converter cores that have had alternate channels plugged - again the plugs force the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> through the wall and the particulate collects on the inlet face.|$|E
