50|$|In the Sterling Formation, {{there is}} roughly 10,000 ft of thick {{sandstone}} that was {{deposited in the}} central and eastern regions of the Cook <b>Inlet</b> <b>Basin</b> during the late Tertiary-early Quaternary period.

50|$|The Cook <b>Inlet</b> <b>Basin</b> is a northeast-trending collisional forearc basin that {{stretches}} from the Gulf of Alaska into South central Alaska, {{just east of the}} Matanuska Valley. It is located in the arc-trench gap between the Alaska-Aleutian Range batholith and contains roughly 80,000 cubic miles of sedimentary rocks. These sediments are mainly derived from Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous sediments.The region is heavily influenced by two major tectonic elements which are still active in the area today. The western side of the basin lies directly above the Aleutian subduction zone where the Pacific Plate is subducting beneath the North American Plate. However {{the eastern side of the}} basin overlays the subduction of the Yakutat microplate beneath the North American plate. Active subduction along various sides of the basin produce regional compression that lead to major folding, faulting and the formation of anticline structures within the sediments. Anticline structures provide ideal hydrocarbon traps, and so the Cook <b>Inlet</b> <b>Basin</b> is widely known for its hydrocarbon accumulations and its overall production of oil and gas.|$|E
40|$|The Walpole and Nornalup Inlets Marine Park {{located on}} WA’s south coast is a {{discrete}} estuarine system comprising two connected inlets and the tidal reaches of three rivers. This estuary is relatively unusual {{in this region}} because its mouth is permanently open to the sea instead of being periodically closed by a wave-generated sand-bar. This means that marine-like conditions prevail within the inlets {{for most of the}} year, except during periods of high rainfall when freshwater flows from the rivers into the <b>inlet</b> <b>basins.</b> This <b>inlet</b> system has not experienced the significant environmental degradation present in many other estuaries in south-western WA, and its remarkable scenery and surrounding forests has made the inlets a focus for recreational activities for many decades. These very high ecological and social values led to the Walpole and Nornalup inlets being made a marine park in 2009. Since formation of the marine park, scientists from DEC’s Marine Science Program and the WA Herbarium have been working with the local management staff to undertake research that will improve our capacity to manage this remarkable area and preserve its ecological and social values. During 2010, this included making the first dedicated survey of benthic algae and seagrasses in the marine park, which turned up some surprising results...|$|R
5000|$|St Georges Basin is {{a coastal}} waterbody located {{immediately}} {{adjacent to the}} Tasman Sea of the South Pacific Ocean, north {{of the town of}} Sussex Inlet and east of the town of St Georges Basin.

50|$|With a {{gradually}} descending {{bottom slope}} beneath the <b>inlet,</b> the <b>basin</b> lacks strong internal thresholds (abruptly steepening slopes) that often isolates the deep of fjord basins from imported tidal currents, thus leaving the Botn basin 'hydrodynamically open' (with very weak topographical stratifications). Thus, the annually induced stagnation depth {{varies with the}} volume and energy of the tidal instream in the critical time when the spring flood dilutes the incoming water rapidly, and accumulating differences along the current shear creates the stratification.

50|$|The Middle Ground Shoal (MGS) {{oil field}} was {{discovered}} in the upper Cook Inlet in July 1962 with the Shell MGS State No. 1 well, and {{is considered one of}} the largest, tightest anticline folds in the Cook <b>Inlet</b> <b>Basin.</b> The field produces oil mainly out of the Tertiary Tyonek Formation, Kenai Group, from a gross interval of 2,800 ft, between depths of 5,100 and 9,700 ft. Additionally, the field contains 31 producing wells, 23 injection wells, 1 shut-in gas well and 8 abandoned wells. As of 1974, the MGS produced nearly 80,000,000 barrels of oil.|$|E
50|$|Alaskan tectonism {{is mainly}} {{dominated}} by the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American Plate. The subduction boundary {{is marked by a}} 4,000 km long trench known as the Aleutian Trench, where seismic activity is common and the volcanic arc produced is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. The initial subduction of the Pacific Plate triggered the formation of the Burin Bay Fault system, which is responsible for northeast trending faults throughout the western portion of the Cook <b>Inlet</b> <b>Basin.</b> Thrust type shearing is present along this active margin and it causes the sediments to form anticline structures as a response to regional compression.|$|E
50|$|Requests for waivers certain {{provisions}} of the act are reviewed by the United States Maritime Administration {{on a case by}} case basis. Waivers have been granted for example, in cases of national emergencies or in cases of strategic interest.

50|$|The {{collision}} of the Yakutat microplate and the Alaskan superterrane {{is believed to}} have happened sometime during the Miocene epoch, after the subduction of the Pacific Plate had already begun. The Yakytat microplate is characterized by a basement of oceanic crust overlain by continental crust. Throughout the basin, Tertiary non-marine stratigraphy have been deformed into northeast-trending, discontinuous folds which partially extend into Mesozoic strata. The ongoing collision is causing the forarc region to collapse into itself, similar to the way a zipper collapses into itself when being zipped shut. This collision is also causing the buildup of an accretionary prism known as the Kenai Mountains, which borders the southeast region of the Cook <b>Inlet</b> <b>basin.</b>|$|E

The main destinations of the gas pipelines are to Kenai where the gas is primarily used to fuel commercial fertilizer production and a liquified natural gas (LNG) plant and to Anchorage where the gas is consumed largely for domestic uses.ConocoPhillips and Marathon operate the LNG terminal under a series of two-year-long licenses issued by the U.S. Department of Energy under Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act. When these companies applied for another two-year extension of the license, various Alaskan entities, including the local fertizer plant opposed the application on the grounds that there was not sufficient gas to meet local requirements as well as the proposed exports. The Agrium fertilizer plant claimed it closed because it could not obtain a gas supply. On June 3, 2008, the Department of Energy granted the extension having found that there were sufficient supplies for Alaska's needs.On 22 July 2014, the Alaska LNG project submitted an application to export LNG to the US Department of Energy (DOE). ExxonMobil has confirmed that the Alaska LNG project will seek to export up to 20 million tpa of LNG. The project will export LNG for a period of 30 years to countries that have existing free trade agreements (FTA) with the US, as well as to non-FTA countries. The project is anticipated to create up to 15,000 jobs during construction and approximately 1000 jobs for operation of the project. ExxonMobil has confirmed that the Alaska LNG project will seek to export up to 20 million tpa of LNG. The Alaska LNG project participants are the Alaska Gasline Development Corp.

40|$|Dynamic {{equilibrium}} {{of short}} tidal systems with ebb deltas, <b>inlets,</b> and <b>basins</b> is poorly understood. Observations suggest {{the possibility of}} equilibrium with sediment import balancing export, while individual channels and shoals at the local scale remain dynamic. Our objectives are to ascertain (1) whether tidal systems under entirely steady forcing can attain this state and (2) under what conditions cyclic channel-shoal migration occurs. We present experiments of tidal systems developing from an initial breach in the coast. We periodically tilted the entire flume to obtain reversing tidal currents and sediment transports. The surface area of the back-barrier <b>basin</b> with an <b>inlet</b> channel with erodible boundaries continued to enlarge while sediment mobility decreased. Experiments with fixed inlet boundaries remained smaller and much more dynamic and had cyclically migrating ebb and flood channels. The same cyclicity with {{a period of about}} 80 tides is observed in shifting dominance of the two channels of the inlet and in the shifting channels in the basin. Experiments with stepwise sea level rises resulted in more rapid channel and bar shifting, increased channel dimensions and basin size. We conclude that cyclic migration of channels is coupled between <b>inlet</b> and <b>basin</b> but the ebb delta did not show such cyclicity. Furthermore, tidal basins with erodible boundaries slowly enlarge by margin erosion toward a system where sediment mobility is at the threshold for motion, as in braided gravel-bed rivers. Consequently, in nature dimensions of tidal systems are partly determined by naturally formed cohesive and vegetated margins and geological context...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2005 The Cook <b>Inlet</b> <b>Basin</b> is {{the source}} {{for all of the}} natural gas used in south-central Alaska. The {{estimated}} ultimate recovery from existing Cook Inlet gas fields is approximately 8. 5 trillion cubic feet (tcf) and the proven reserves remaining on January 1, 2004 were 1. 8 tcf. It will be difficult to meet the peak demand for gas in south-central Alaska after 2009. Cook <b>Inlet</b> <b>Basin</b> contains vast quantities of unconventional gas resources in tight sands. Resources-in-place and producible gas reserves from the tight sands are unknown. It is likely that these tight sands will be developed as additional gas reserves and will be produced along with the high permeability conventional gas reserves in order to meet both local and export demands. The objectives of this study are to quantify the distribution of tight gas sands; to estimate the resources in place and producible gas reserves in the Cook Inlet Basin; and to predict the post-stimulation gas production. Rate transient analysis, well log analysis and reservoir stimulation analysis were therefore conducted on selected key tight sand wells. Results indicate that the tight gas can {{play an important role in}} meeting south-central Alaska's gas demand beyond 2009...|$|E

40|$|The {{cross-sectional}} {{stability of}} double inlet systems is investigated using an exploratory model that combines Escoffier’s stability concept for {{the evolution of}} the inlet’s cross-sectional area with a two-dimensional, depth-averaged (2 DH) hydrodynamic model for tidal flow. The model geometry consists of four rectangular compartments, each with a uniform depth, associated with the ocean, tidal <b>inlets</b> and <b>basin.</b> The water motion, forced by an incoming Kelvin wave at the ocean’s open boundary and satisfying the linear shallow water equations on the f -plane with linearised bottom friction, is in each compartment written as a superposition of eigenmodes, i. e. Kelvin and Poincaré waves. A collocation method is employed to satisfy boundary and matching conditions. The analysis of resulting equilibrium configurations is done using flow diagrams. Model results show that internally generated spatial variations in the water motion are essential for the existence of stable equilibria with two inlets open. In the hydrodynamic model used in the paper, both radiation damping into the ocean and basin depth effects result in these necessary spatial variations. Coriolis effects trigger an asymmetry in the stable equilibrium cross-sectional areas of the <b>inlets.</b> Furthermore, square <b>basin</b> geometries generally correspond to significantly larger equilibrium values of the inlet cross-sections. These model outcomes result from a competition between a destabilising (caused by inlet bottom friction) and a stabilising mechanism (caused by spatially varying local pressure gradients over the inlets) ...|$|R
