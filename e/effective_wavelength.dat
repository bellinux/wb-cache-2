In this work, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology was applied for the classification of soil types and the measurement of soil total nitrogen (TN) content. A total of 183 soil samples collected from Shangyu City (People’s Republic of China), were scanned by a near-infrared hyperspectral imaging system with a wavelength range of 874 – 1734 nm. The soil samples belonged to three major soil types typical of this area, including paddy soil, red soil and seashore saline soil.

Pattern texture features (energy, contrast, homogeneity and entropy) were extracted from the gray-scale images at the <b>effective</b> <b>wavelengths.</b> The support vector machines (SVM) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) methods were used to establish classification and prediction models, respectively. The results showed that by using the combined data sets of <b>effective</b> <b>wavelengths</b> and texture features for modelling an optimal correct classification rate of 91. 8 %. could be achieved. The soil samples were first classified, then the local models were established for soil TN according to soil types, which achieved better prediction results than the general models.

The collective mode dynamics is described by means of effective physical quantities for the scattering geometry with the external magnetic field applied perpendicularly to the Bloch wave vector in the antidot plane. As an example, the definition of an effective field, incorporating the demagnetizing effects due to the holes, permits to describe the dynamical properties of collective modes in terms of effective properties in the travelling regime. An <b>effective</b> <b>wavelength</b> and a small wave vector are introduced both for extended and localized magnonic modes.

40|$|State of research: Interferometric {{techniques}} {{with digital}} fringe evaluation {{are appropriate for}} precision measurements on optically polished surfaces. Problems occur, when optically rough surfaces need to be measured. Aim of research: to investigate a interferometry method to measure surface topography of rough materials by means of digital fringe evaluation. Method: the oblique incidence interferometry was selected {{in order to increase}} the poor specular reflection of rough objects and to reduce the fringe density. Results: a special oblique incidence interferometer was created using a modified Dove-Prism as a beam splitter to adapt digital fringe evaluation techniques. The required phase shifts are achieved by variations of the injection current of the laser diode. To use this method of phase-shifting an unbalanced interferometer is necessary. The <b>effective</b> <b>wavelength</b> is #lambda#_e_f_f= 4. 3 #mu#m by the used of oblique incidence (#delta#= 81). This <b>effective</b> <b>wavelength</b> enables us to measure a maximal step height of 1 #mu#m. Object surfaces to a roughness of Ra= 0. 4 #mu#m can be measured with a resolution of 0. 05 #mu#m. The field of view has a diameter of 30 mm. In this case a lateral resolution of 120 #mu#m is achieved. In the next step we studied a three-wavelength-interferometer with oblique incidence. The <b>effective</b> <b>wavelength</b> of the new experimental setup is #lambda#_e_f_f= 100 #mu#m. Now we are able to measure vertical steps of 25 #mu#m. The other specifications are the same as for the one-wavelength-interferometer because the single-wavelength is fitted to the <b>effective</b> <b>wavelength.</b> Applications: the oblique incidence interferometry has a high potential for industrial applications. The main advantage of this interferometry method is its application onto technical surfaces to measure using digital fringe evaluation. (orig.)
