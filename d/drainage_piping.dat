40|$|The {{undergraduate}} education {{of a chemical}} engineer has, {{for more than half}} a century, included a senior course in design. In early years, as exemplified in the textbook, Chemical Engineering Plant Design", by Vilbrandt 1, emphasis was placed not on process design, i. e. design of the process structure and the equipment, but on plant design, including consideration of foundations, <b>drainage,</b> <b>piping</b> installation, buildings, power transmission, plant location, plant layout, and preconstruction cost estimates. Some attention was given to selection and arrangement of equipment. The textbook, "Plant Design and Economics for Chemical Engineers", which first appeared in 1958 and now, under the authorship of Peters and Timmerhaus 2 is in its fourth edition, took a much different approach, greatly emphasizing the economic aspects of plant design, including cost estimation and profitability analysis. In addition, extensive chapters were provided on design and costing of equipment for materials transfer and handling, heat transfer, mass transfer, and chemical reactions. In Peters and Timmerhaus, emphasis shifted from plant design to process design, but little attention was given to the synthesis of a process structure. Prior to the 1960 s, the development, by practicing chemical engineers in industry, of a process design for a given process structure, including material and energy balances and overall sizing o...|$|E

40|$|After having {{researched}} {{a construction}} {{system based on}} CAD-CAM and CNC, {{we come to the}} conclusion that this system is appropriate for implementing it in refurbishment processes in old buildings. More precisely, refurbishment in buildings erected before industrialization with wooden structure and masonry facades in dense and historic city quarters. The main goals of the construction system are the recyclability of all elements, energy savings, bioclimatic performance, economy, accuracy and safety in the building site and simple procedures to write the project documentation. The old quarters accessibility is often a handicap for implementing standardized components. In this case, the structural panels can be elevated to the floors with a reasonable physical effort for the worker, using the staircase, instead of an electric elevator. Moreover, the heterogeneous personal economical resources of the neighbours in the building, is often an added problem for executing overall refurbishment of buildings. This system allows to make partial refurbishments and can work in different phases. The new program layout planned for the buildings or apartments solved with the common refurbishment technologies and systems, requires an added slab of 20 cm for the <b>drainage</b> <b>piping</b> system. The application of the system can avoid this. The construction system is adaptable to any geometry. In this way, there is no problem to applying the system on non-orthogonal plots. Using a CAD-CAM coordinated system the structure is easily adaptable to irregular geometries and dimensions. During the first industrial era, in the historic city centre buildings, the insertion of plumbing system in a wooden structure building was rarely successful. The wooden structure near these plumbing facilities, is almost always rotten or damaged. The proposed construction system offers a solution for this problematic. Normally such historic buildings don´t have a correct insulation. The system allows a bioclimatic performance of the whole building...|$|E

40|$|RECONDES is {{a three-year}} EU-funded project, which focus is to {{mitigate}} desertification processes {{by means of}} innovative techniques using vegetation in specific landscape configurations prone to severe degradation processes. One of the research themes {{is the impact of}} desertification on abandoned land and potential mitigation practices. Land abandonment is nowadays widely spread in Spain and is expected to increase. Previous research showed that gully erosion was higher on abandoned fields compared to similar cultivated fields. Especially fields that are terraced or have earth dams are prone to gully erosion after abandonment, due to restoration of the natural <b>drainage</b> pattern and <b>piping</b> in case of dispersive substrate. Main cause of increased erosion is the absence of ploughing and a low vegetation recovery, which results in sealing crusts and bare spots with low infiltration rates leading to more runoff and finally gully erosion. The objective of this paper was to analyse the consequences of land abandonment on erosion and to provide effective eco-engineering techniques for mitigation of gully erosion. The study was carried out in the Carcavo basin, a semi-arid catchment in Southeast Spain. At catchment scale all abandoned fields were surveyed and characteristics of each field, gullies and terrace failures were described. One abandoned valley was surveyed at a more detailed scale to create a precise DTM and detailed aerial photographs were taken to study vegetation patterns. The results reveal that gullies on abandoned fields are often located on critical positions at the transition of the hillslope to the channel. This means that when a gully becomes active the connectivity of runoff and sediment in the landscape increases considerably, with the negative off-site effects as a consequence. A reconstruction of eroded sediment from the DTM confirms the importance of gully erosion in terms of sediment losses. Overflow at the lowest point and piping seem to be the main causes of terrace failure. Especially the influence of piping increases in dispersive soils after abandonment, because the topsoil is not ploughed anymore and runoff can enter directly the subsoil through cracks and macro-pores that have been developed after abandonment. Two potential soil and water conservation practices are: (1) Maintenance of terraces and earth dams, as a result more water is retained, which increases the vegetation cover and that strengthens the terrace or earth dam. Only in dispersive soils the risk of piping remains. (2) Revegetation on critical spots in the landscape with indigenous species that grow fast and have dense rooting systems to bind the soil...|$|R

WSDOT is proposing riparian restoration {{as an alternative to}} the construction of large stormwater detention facilities for the State Route 167 Extension Project. Buildings, roads, culverts, and other infrastructure will be removed and the land use will be converted back to a riparian forest. Within the 189 acres proposed for riparian restoration: approximately 30 acres of existing impervious surface will be removed; 63 acres of existing wetlands will be restored; 19 stream crossings will be removed or improved; fill materials in the floodplain will be removed; 13, 000 feet of stream channel will be protected; 9, 350 feet of stream channel will be created; and the area will be replanted with native vegetation. The RRP is expected to prevent property damage caused from flooding by removing buildings, roads, and infrastructure from flood prone areas. Project implementation with the RRP is predicted to reduce future flooding impacts by 48 percent compared to future conditions without the project. The RRP is expected to provide water quality treatment above and beyond any wet ponds or similar treatment facilities required under the Highway Runoff Manual by removing sediment and nutrients from surface runoff. The RRP is expected to result in considerable benefits to streams by reestablishing vegetated riparian buffers which in¬crease shade to maintain cooler water temperatures. Establishing woody vegetation increases bank stability and helps form habitat for fish and wildlife, and improves water quality. The RRP will also reduce the amount of inlet structures and <b>drainage</b> <b>piping</b> required to maintain flow control, while at the same time increasing the channel migration area. As the future large woody debris recruitment forces channel migration, the abandoned stream channels will develop into wetlands and off-channel rearing habitats for fish. The RRP includes the restoration of upland habitat within the riparian buffers, and also provides wildlife habitat and migration corridors, and will provide improved wetland buffer functions. A Net Environmental Benefits Analysis was performed to quantitatively estimate and compare the relative ecological losses and gains between the use of conventional stormwater treatment ponds and the RRP approach. Project wide, the RRP approach was found to have 57 percent greater environmental benefit than the conventional treatment approach...|$|E
40|$|Consumption of {{plastics}} has increased exponentially, {{in line with}} the world&# 039;s population. Not surprisingly this is reflected in enormous growth of the plastic industry especially during the last five decades. Commensurate with this, waste produced from plastics consumption has created a major environmental problem. Many types of waste disposal methods have been used all over the world so far, but all of them have disadvantages. Furthermore, some methods are responsible for the generation of green house gases and further contribution to global warming. Recently, reduction of green house gas emission has become a target of most industries. Plastic recycling and reuse breaks the cycle of endless production of virgin polymer and thus contributes to a net reduction of green house gas emission. Recycling {{of plastics}} should produce materials with improved properties to replace virgin plastics for a variety of applications. Improvement in the properties of recycled plastics can be achieved by blending with other plastics, by filler addition and by modification using free radical initiators. Introduction of the free radical initiator (organic peroxide) during reprocessing of the recycled plastics has been found to offer significant property improvements to the recycled materials. Extremely small amounts of a free radical initiator (typically ranging between 0. 01 wt% to 0. 2 wt%) is capable of enhancing the properties of the recycled plastics to a great extent. This project investigates the use of free radical initiators in the recycling of post consumer recycled high density polyethylene using reactive extrusion. Both molecular and rheological characterisation of recycled and reprocessed materials was carried out and this was followed by tensile testing of the modified materials to satisfy end use applications such as packaging and <b>drainage</b> <b>piping.</b> Post consumer recycled high density polyethylene (R-HDPE) resin and virgin high density polyethylene (V-HDPE) were reactively extruded with low concentrations of dicumyl peroxide (DCP) and 1, 3 1, 4 Bis (tert- butylperoxyisopropyl) Benzene (OP 2) respectively in a twin screw extruder in order to produce modified materials with varying composition (0. 0 wt%, 0. 02 wt%, 0. 05 wt%, 0. 07 wt%, 0. 10 wt% and 0. 15 wt%) of both organic peroxides. Morphological characterisation using modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) demonstrated that there is a decrease in the crystallinity level for all the modified samples. Shear rheological tests were carried out to study the structure of the modified materials within the linear viscoelastic region. Viscoelastic parameters, such as storage modulus (G&# 039;), loss modulus (G&quot;) and complex viscosity (&ccedil;*) showed improvement at all frequencies tested with increase in both peroxides compositions. Higher improvements were experienced with OP 2 modified V-HDPE and R-HDPE. R-HDPE showed greatest improvement in viscoelastic properties due to the inclusion of low level of carbon black as stabilizer. However, increase in peroxide loading causes appearance of the divergence of complex viscosity profile from Newtonian plateau to non-Newtonian slope analogous to finite yield stress region. Formation of long chain branches or extended chain mechanism causes disappearance of terminal zone and shear thinning like characteristics. Extensional rheological study, using the melt strength tester, was carried out to evaluate the response of the modified material to extensional deformation. However, melt strength is not a well-defined rheological property because of non-uniform strain and temperature along a drawn filament. Melt strength of V-HDPE and R-HDPE was enhanced with peroxide modifications. Alignment of the long chain branched molecules in the uni-directional stretching requires more force to stretch the polymer strand leading to enhancement in the melt strength. On the other hand, these long chain branched molecules restrict motion of the chain due to the higher relaxation time, thus can not resist rupture of the strand at higher draw ratio. Thus, extensibility was found to decrease with increased melt strength. Instabilities like draw resonance and ductile fracture were experienced with peroxide loading leading to processing limitations. Extensional viscosity was found to increase with all modified samples. This enhancement was a lso experienced with recycled modified materials. Molecular characterisation was done to assess the molecular level changes during reactive extrusion and peroxide modification process for all the modified materials. Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) of all the peroxide modified materials showed increase in weight average (Mw) and number average (Mn) molecular weight with respect to the peroxide loading. In addition, increments in Mw than Mn indicated increased branch length. Branching index (g&# 039;) also showed lower values as branching mechanisms developed. Environmental stress cracking resistance was also measured to evaluate the suitability of the modified material in terms of the targeted pipe application. Resistance to stress crack growth increased with peroxide modifications for both virgin and R-HDPE. However, elongation properties were found to decrease with peroxide loading...|$|E
