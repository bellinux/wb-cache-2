25|$|This was {{designed}} in late 1916 {{and took the}} form of a new synchronization gear without any rods at all. The cam that generated the firing impulses was moved from the engine to the gun itself; the trigger motor in effect now generated its own firing impulses. The linkage between the propeller and the gun now consisted of a <b>flexible</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> directly connecting the end of the engine camshaft to the trigger motor of the gun. The firing button for the gun simply engaged a clutch at the engine which set the flexible drive (and thus the trigger motor) in motion. In some ways this brought the new gear closer to the original Schneider patent (q.v.).|$|E

Buick's Dual Path was an air-cooled 2-speed unit with a planetary gearset inside the flywheel-mounted torque converter. The first Pontiac Tempests used {{a modified version of the}} Powerglide transaxle shared with the Chevrolet Corvair. But unlike the Corvairs, the TempesTorque was connected via a <b>flexible</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> to an unconventional slant-4 (half of a 389 V-8) or an aluminum 215 c.i. V-8, which would be later sold to the Rover Group and be renamed the 3500 V-8.The smaller 61-05 as fitted to the Vauxhall Cresta was dubbed the [...] "smoothamatic from Luton" [...] in Cars Illustrated in Feb 1961 being quite taken with the overall refinement with the test car, also noting that full throttle starts could be made on slushy roads, perhaps giving away the rather tall 1st gear and minimal torque conversion. They also stated that the gearshifts were so smooth as to be practically imperceptible. The magazine The Motor, Dec 1960, also praised the high standard of smoothness with very lively performance. The performance was claimed to be almost as fast as with synchromesh gears and the 2-3 shift could be so gradual in gentle driving that the driver did not always realise it has happened. Certainly, the examples the author drove were equal to this and it seemed disappointing when the 61-05 model was discontinued in favour of the Powerglide in 1965.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 03 This master’s thesis {{describes}} {{the design process}} and testing results for a pneumatically actuated, manually-operated tool for confined space drilling operations. The purpose of this device is to back-drill pilot holes inside a commercial airplane wing. It is lightweight, and a “locator pin” enables the operator to align the drill over a pilot hole. A suction pad stabilizes the system, and an air motor and <b>flexible</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> power the drill. Two testing procedures were performed to determine the practicality of this prototype. The first was the “offset drill test”, which qualified the exit hole position error due to an initial position error relative to the original pilot hole. The results displayed a linear relationship, and {{it was determined that}} position errors of less than. 060 ” would prevent the need for rework, with errors of up to. 030 ” considered acceptable. For the second test, a series of holes were drilled with the pneumatic tool and analyzed for position error, diameter range, and cycle time. The position errors and hole diameter range were within the allowed tolerances. The average cycle time was 45 seconds, 73 percent of which was for drilling the hole, and 27 percent of which was for positioning the device. Recommended improvements are discussed in the conclusion, and include a more durable <b>flexible</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft,</b> a damper for drill feed control, and a more stable locator pin...|$|E
30|$|HY-TUF {{steel is}} a {{specific}} class of low-alloy medium-carbon steel that derives its strength from martensitic transformation and precipitation of carbides in a quenched and tempered condition. In HY-TUF steel, compared to other low-alloy medium-carbon steels (such as AISI 4340 steel), C content is maintained at a low level (< 0.26  wt%); the contents of Si and Mn are relatively high (~ 3  wt%), as well as Ni (~ 1.80  wt%). This design of the composition is considered for HY-TUF steel to get superior toughness and resistance to crack propagation as well as ultra-high strength. In addition, vacuum arc remelting (VAR) {{is used in the}} steel-making process of HY-TUF steel to have a clean material with low content of inclusions. HY-TUF steel has aerospace and aircraft applications where lightweight structure with ultra-high strength and toughness are essential and cost is not a major concern such as main landing gear, ultra-sensitive screws, and <b>flexible</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> of helicopter (Klopp 1992).|$|E
40|$|The Idaho Botanical Garden (IBG) has {{recently}} acquired {{a display of}} carnivorous plants. One breed in particular, the Venus flytrap, is a very unique plant that closes its leaves when its hairs are triggered by insects walking on it. Visitors to the garden love to touch this dynamic plant’s ‘head’, but when touched the leaves close with no food. With its limited number of movements in a lifespan, the delicate plant lacks nutrients each time it closes with no food and eventually dies. We were tasked with creating a larger scale (4 : 1) model of a Venus flytrap plant that the patrons of the IBG can interact. From specifications centering on safety of anyone interacting with the model and proportional size of the model, we designed a robotic device that will have one moving ‘head’ approximately sixteen inches in diameter and exhibit the same closing cycle the actual plants use to catch prey. Our design centers around a stepper motor that is connected to a hinged head mechanism via a <b>flexible</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft.</b> The mechanism will be mounted in a ‘planter’ to disguise the mechanical and electrical components that would detract from the lifelike model. The ‘head’ will be a metal skeleton over-molded with a green silicone skin to simulate {{the texture of the}} plant’s skin. Furthermore, the device will be activated by ‘trigger hairs’ similar to a living Venus flytrap in nature. This created model will educate and entertain the patrons of the IBG while preserving the less hardy plants...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} {{the performance of a}} newly designed percutaneous catheter with expandable pump. BackgroundThe device was designed as a percutaneously insertable temporary support system for patients with acute left ventricular failure. MethodsThe pump catheter (introduction diameter 9 -F) is positioned in the left ventricle. The rotor is driven by an external motor through a <b>flexible</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft.</b> A model circuit was used to assess pump performance, hemolysis tests, and particle image velocimetry. The feasibility of the catheter placement and pump operation were examined in 12 anesthetized sheep. Cardiogenic shock was induced in seven of the animals. Cardiac output (CO) and mean aortic blood pressure (MAP) were recorded before and during shock, and during catheter pump action. ResultsThe catheter pump delivered a flow of 4. 1 l/min at a differential pressure of 60 mm Hg. The average modified index of hemolysis was 11. 6 (optimum, 1. 8). Fluoroscopically and echocardiographically guided in vivo placement and deployment of the device were quick and uncomplicated. Under simulation of acute left ventricular failure (CO 43 ± 22 % and MAP 55 ± 16 % of the baseline value), the catheter pump significantly improved CO to 67 ± 12 % and MAP to 74 ± 18 %. Maximum in vivo duration of operation was 6 h (average, 3. 1 ± 1. 4 h). These animal studies revealed: 1) no significant hemolysis (average plasma-free hemoglobin 26 ± 4 mg/l after 3 h); 2) no thrombotic deposits at rotor or pump housing; and 3) no damage to the endocardium or aortic valve. ConclusionsA percutaneously insertable, expandable catheter pump is technically and clinically feasible. Our first experimental results are encouraging...|$|E

The study uses experimental results obtained on an instrumented boat to perform CFD computations. All parameters are considered except the minor role played by the spin rotation of the shaft. The numerical results fit fairly well with experimental data given a high number of uncertainties. Once CFD computations fully validated, more accurate parametric models could be built and integrated in a rowing simulator which will help coaching staff in analysing and improving performance and training of athletes.
