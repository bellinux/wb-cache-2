6000|$|She {{jerked her}} hand away, and, burying it with its mate in his curly mop, shook his <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b> [...] "What shall I do with him, father?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And Michael did, bumping his flanks against Daughtry's knee; nudging {{his head}} against Daughtry's hand, in {{solicitation}} {{for more of the}} blissful ear-rubbing and tail-twisting. Daughtry caught him by the jowl instead and slowly moved his <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> as he addressed him: ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{the weeks}} went by, and he {{continued}} to grow more tractable. And through it all the weariness was asserting itself more and more. [...] "I am so tired, so tired," [...] he would murmur, rolling his <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> on the pillow like a peevish child. At a little later period he began to make impassioned pleas for death, to beg her to kill him, to beg Hans to put him our of his misery {{so that he might}} at least rest comfortably.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "shaky-face" [...] badge photos {{required}} attendees {{to submit}} a picture of themselves taken while violently shaking their <b>heads</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b> This resulted in some very unusual portraits.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, some {{of these}} lemurs are unaware of the danger humans pose and will {{approach}} humans on the ground. To intimidate predators they do recognize, the lemurs will announce the threat with a warning call, {{and stare at the}} threat, shaking their <b>heads</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b>|$|R
50|$|Several {{of their}} {{behaviors}} strike scientists as peculiar. One such behavior is {{the habit of}} sleeping tsessebe to rest their mouths {{on the ground with}} their horns sticking straight up into the air. Male tsessebe have also been observed standing in parallel ranks with their eyes closed, bobbing their <b>heads</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b> These habits are peculiar because scientists have yet to find a proper explanation for their purposes or functions.|$|R
60|$|Remained awake, as dawn paled the dark, {{only the}} grievously wounded or the too-tightly bound, and the {{decrepit}} ancient {{who was not}} so old as Bashti. When the boy who had stunned Jerry with his paddle-blade and who claimed him as his own stole into the canoe house, the ancient did not hear him. Being blind, {{he did not see}} him. He continued gibbering and chuckling dementedly, to twist the bushman's <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> and to feed the smudge with punk-wood. This was no night-task for any man, nor even for him who had forgotten how to do aught else. But the excitement of cutting out the Arangi had been communicated to his addled brain, and, with vague reminiscent flashes of the strength of life triumphant, he shared deliriously in this triumph of Somo by applying himself to the curing of the head that was in itself the concrete expression of triumph.|$|E
60|$|He {{shoved the}} slide part way back and rested his arms on it, his body {{still in the}} companion-way. His {{attitude}} was of one looking forward {{the length of the}} schooner, or staring, rather, for his eyes were fixed and unblinking. I was only five feet away and directly in what should have been his line of vision. It was uncanny. I felt myself a ghost, what of my invisibility. I waved my hand back and forth, of course without effect; but when the moving shadow fell across his face I saw at once that he was susceptible to the impression. His face became more expectant and tense as he tried to analyze and identify the impression. He knew that he had responded to something from without, that his sensibility had been touched by a changing something in his environment; but what it was he could not discover. I ceased waving my hand, so that the shadow remained stationary. He slowly moved his <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> under it and turned from side to side, now in the sunshine, now in the shade, feeling the shadow, as it were, testing it by sensation.|$|E
50|$|Pedar Sookhte!: When Balad-Ol-Molk threatens someone (usually Mostashar) {{he starts}} by using {{something}} they've said, makes 4 or 5 deductions from that, {{and ends up}} accusing them of something completely unrelated, all the while raising his voice higher and higher, eventually erupting shouting this (which is a common Iranian curse) and violently whipping his <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Horse symbols {{permeate}} the text. Rennie, an accomplished rider, {{and her husband}} whip their <b>heads</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> horse-like when they laugh. Joe is fond of the epithet horseshit when pointing out nonsense. His surname, Morgan, {{is the name of}} an American breed of horse. Joe's consistent sureness, his [...] "rationality and absence of 'craft or guile'", according to Thomas Schaub, seem to echo the Houyhnhnms, the race of rational horses in Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels.|$|R
50|$|The airport attracts people <b>heading</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> {{between the}} EAA's AirVenture, Air Academy and other {{programs}} in nearby Oshkosh. Starting in 2017, the airport began to offer camping for AirVenture. Appleton International is also used for people heading to events at Lambeau Field in nearby Green Bay, most popularly Green Bay Packers games. The airport often offers flights to Northeastern Wisconsin during Packer game weekends at a cheaper fare than Green Bay-Austin Straubel International Airport, the main airport for Green Bay.|$|R
50|$|These {{tortoises}} make a {{sound like}} a baby cooing with a raspy voice. Tortoises also identify each other using body language. The male tortoise makes head movements toward other males, but the female does not make these head movements. Male tortoises also swing their <b>heads</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> in a continuous rhythm as a mating ritual. Mating occurs all year round for the yellow-footed tortoise. There is no parental care of the young and the baby tortoises will fend for themselves, starting by eating calcium-rich plant matter.|$|R
50|$|The turkey face gesture is {{when you}} take your hand and put your thumb on your nose, wriggle your <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> {{and do the same}} thing with the hand. Cocking a snook is an old British taunting gesture in which the thumb of one hand is on the nose and the {{extended}} fingers are wiggled.|$|E
5000|$|A Unazukin {{looks like}} a small [...] "angel" [...] {{averaging}} 5 cm (2 inches) high. They are reminiscent of a nesting Matryoshka doll, and have a retro/popart style decoration. Some models are voice activated and react to voice, nodding and shaking their head. Battery powered with an on/off switch, they have four different movements, shaking <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> once or twice; and nodding once or twice.|$|E
5000|$|Thaddeus [...] "Pecker" [...] Bird - The Faulconer County school {{master and}} {{brother-in-law}} of Washington Faulconer. He {{is described as}} tall and thin with a long beard, who bobs his <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> when laughing, which has earned him the nickname [...] "Pecker". Although firstly thought of as an eccentric fool, he gains {{the respect of the}} legion with his natural battle leadership abilities.|$|E
50|$|For a bird of {{such great}} size, the great slaty {{woodpecker}} has a weak, quiet voice, especially {{compared to other}} large woodpeckers, which tend to have loud, booming voices. The species call is a whinnying cackle of 2 to 5, usually 4 notes, woikwoikwoikwoik, the initial being higher in pitched and the middle note being distinctly lower. Single dwot calls, variable in sound, strength and duration, are sometimes given while perched or in flight. Breeding pairs of these woodpeckers have been heard to softly mew at each other. In more antagonistic situations, sharp taw-whit or dew-it calls are uttered while the birds swing their <b>heads</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b>|$|R
50|$|An entire {{colony of}} all age/size classes has once been {{observed}} just underwater, foraging {{together in the}} shallows of a small woodland shrub swamp, their <b>heads</b> moving <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> with mouths open, even {{along with a few}} common water snakes. They were apparently foraging for tadpoles.|$|R
50|$|The jewel-babblers {{resemble}} the quail-thrushes in shape, being plump, long-tailed and short winged. They are adapted {{to life on}} the forest floor. The plumage of this genus is the most striking divergence from the quail-thrushes, having large amounts of blue and often with chestnut on the back. The throats of all species are white and the patch is mostly surrounded by a black edge. There is moderate levels of sexual dimorphism in the plumage, except in the dimorphic jewel-babbler where the female has no blue and is all chestnut coloured. When moving they hold the body horizontally to the ground, <b>and</b> bob their <b>heads</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> {{in a similar fashion}} to pigeons, and move their tail in a fashion similar to wagtails.|$|R
5000|$|Sliding compound-miter saw - Sliding {{adds the}} {{radial arm saw}} feature {{of being able to}} move the saw <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> {{increasing}} the board size that can be cross cut. Without the sliding feature the cut is a straight pull down feature (like chop saws). With the sliding feature engaged the user pulls the head forward, turns on the saw and pushes the blade back across the lumber.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Robert McClelland, {{who treated}} Oswald {{after he was}} shot, noticed Leavelle waiting outside the {{hospital}} room and says that Leavelle told him that after Oswald was shot, {{he claimed to have}} [...] "leaned over Oswald and said, 'Son, you're hurt real bad. Do you wanna say anything?' He looked at me for a second. He waited, like he was thinking. Then he shook his <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> just as wide as he could. Then he closed his eyes." ...|$|E
50|$|When Camuti {{was about}} 11 years old, he had typhoid fever, and while sick in bed, his mother {{left the house}} with food cooking on the stove. When the pot boiled over, gas began to fill the home. Their cat jumped onto his chest and weaved her <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b> He {{was too weak to}} get out of bed, and felt the cats efforts may have saved his life. Camuti began specializing in cats around 1932-33. At the time, veterinarians did not spend much time {{providing}} services to cats.|$|E
5000|$|Weaving is {{a stable}} vice of horses, {{in which the}} horse repetitively sways side to side, {{shifting}} weight and moving its <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The festivities in Phuket {{include a}} {{procession}} of masong wearing elaborate costumes who pierce their cheeks and tongues with all manner of things, including swords, banners, machine guns, table lamps, and flowers. While the face {{is the most common}} area pierced, some also pierce their arms with pins and fishhooks. Teams of people accompany the masong to keep their wounds clean and to help support the heavier piercings. It is believed that while they are possessed the masong will not feel any pain. They can also be seen shaking their <b>heads</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> continually, <b>and</b> usually do not seem to [...] "see" [...] their surroundings. At the temple during the festival there is also firewalking and blade-ladder climbing. While large crowds of people gather to watch, the entranced mah song distribute blessed candy and pieces of orange cloth with Chinese characters printed on them yang ยังต์ for good luck.|$|R
50|$|Edgeline {{printing}} is {{a printing}} technology based on ink jet printing. In {{the case of}} traditional ink jet printers, the tiny matchbox size print <b>head</b> moves <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b> This has inherent delay and requires two dimensional movement: (a) movement of print head; and (b) movement of paper. These movements {{are one of the}} reasons for the time lag in the ink jet printing.|$|R
50|$|Early {{versions}} of Unix filesystems {{were referred to}} simply as FS. FS only included the boot block, superblock, a clump of inodes, and the data blocks. This worked well for the small disks early Unixes were designed for, but as technology advanced and disks grew larger, moving the <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> between the clump of inodes and the data blocks they referred to caused thrashing. Marshall Kirk McKusick, then a Berkeley graduate student, optimized the BSD 4.2's FFS (Fast File System) by inventing cylinder groups, which break the disk up into smaller chunks, with each group having its own inodes and data blocks.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of {{conjugate}} gaze palsies {{include the}} impairment of gaze in various directions and {{different types of}} movement, {{depending on the type}} of gaze palsy. Signs of a person with a gaze palsy may be frequent movement of the head instead of the eyes. For example, a person with a horizontal saccadic palsy may jerk their head around while watching a movie or high action event instead of keeping their head steady and moving their eyes, which usually goes unnoticed. Someone with a nonselective horizontal gaze palsy may slowly rotate their <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> while reading a book instead of slowly scanning their eyes across the page.|$|E
50|$|The red-legged {{cormorant}} is a non-colonial seabird, instead {{living in}} pairs or small groups. Courtship typically occurs in January and February. The males {{can engage in}} elaborate mating displays, which include darting and throwback postures. During darting, males chirp quietly while moving the <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> exposing {{the interior of the}} mouth. When the female advances, the male displays a throwback posture; outstretching the neck and pointing the bill towards the tail. The female may respond to the male's display by hopping and throat clicking. When the female selects a male, periods of allopreening ensue, followed by copulation. Red-legged cormorant pairs are observed to be monogamous for at least one season.|$|E
50|$|The floppy {{drive of}} the Commodore Amiga {{personal}} computer {{could be made}} to produce noises of various pitches by making the drive <b>heads</b> move <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b> A program existed which could play El Cóndor Pasa, more or less correctly, on the Amiga's floppy drive. As some sounds relied on the head assembly hitting the stop, this gradually sent the head out of alignment.|$|R
60|$|Drummer the Woodpecker was {{pounding}} out his danger signal {{so fast and}} so hard that his red <b>head</b> flew <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> almost too fast to see. Rat-a-tat-tat-a-tat-tat, beat Drummer on the old tree trunk {{on the edge of}} the Green Forest. When he stopped for breath, he looked down into the scowling face of Farmer Brown's boy, who was hiding behind the old tree trunk.|$|R

50|$|The player {{must put}} {{his or her}} head and hand to match head and hand {{outlines}} on the screen {{to make sure that}} the player is at an ideal distance from the DSi. Once the player keeps their pose for three seconds, the game begins. Before each microgame, the player must match his or her head and sometimes hand or hands with the silhouettes shown on the screen. Once the player gets into the pose, it proceeds to the microgame, and the player must move per what the microgame requires - for example, one microgame requires the player to dry a dog's fur by shaking his or her <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b> Kat & Ana's stages require two players.|$|E
50|$|Zaffis {{admits that}} he was {{initially}} very skeptical {{of the existence of}} ghosts, until one Wednesday evening when he was sixteen and saw a transparent apparition at the foot of his bed shaking its <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b> When he told his mother of the incident, Zaffis learned that his grandfather, when he was alive, always shook his head when he was upset about something. In the next few days, Zaffis' grandmother, who lived with him, died. This incident piqued his interest in the paranormal and set him about talking to authorities on the subject and reading about the paranormal. Zaffis spent his first years studying under his uncle and aunt Ed and Lorraine Warren, both demonologists.|$|E
50|$|The {{conditions}} and systems associated with floccular loss {{are considered to}} be a subset of a vestibular disease. Some symptoms of common vestibular diseases include: head tilting, an inability to stand, ataxia, dizziness, vomiting and strabismus. Because of the flocculus’ role in the vestibular system, the inner ear, equilibrioception, and both peripheral and central vision is affected by any loss or damage to the Flocculus. These systems are affected because damage to the flocculus prevents any changes from being stored in regards to visual and motor communication, meaning that although the VOR is still intact these systems are unable to store changes in gain or eye movement as you rotate your <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b>|$|E
60|$|Peter {{was sitting}} with his <b>head</b> tipped <b>back</b> trying to see Downy. At first he couldn't make him out. Then he caught a little {{movement}} {{on top of a}} dead limb. It was Downy's <b>head</b> flying <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> as he beat his long roll. He was dressed all in black and white. On the <b>back</b> of his <b>head</b> was a little scarlet patch. He was making a tremendous racket for such a little chap, only a little bigger than one of the Sparrow family.|$|R
60|$|Once more he was {{swung into}} {{position}} by his tail, jabbed in the chest, and lowered suddenly on the run--but so suddenly, with a frantic twist {{of his body}} on his part, that he fell violently across the chair on his belly. What little wind was left him from the strangling, {{seemed to have been}} ruined out of him by the violence of the fall. The glare in his eyes was maniacal and swimming. He panted frightfully, <b>and</b> his <b>head</b> rolled <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b> Slaver dripped from his mouth, blood ran from his nose.|$|R
60|$|Hardly was he out {{of sight}} when Peter saw Drummer heading that way, and Drummer looked very much put out about something. He just nodded to Peter and flew {{straight}} to Unc' Billy's tree. Then he began to drum. How he did drum! His red-capped <b>head</b> flew <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> as Peter never had seen it fly before. Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat! Rat-a-tat-tat-tat! Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat! Drummer hardly paused for breath. There was too much noise for Peter, and he kicked up his heels {{and started for the}} Smiling Pool, and all the way there he laughed.|$|R
