5|$|The {{system has}} {{two types of}} receivers: radio terminals, which can either be {{hand-held}} or mounted in vehicles, and desktop equipment for control centers. The system will include 40,000 radios throughout the country. Compared to the analog network, the digital radio equipment will be smaller and have options for additional equipment such as hands free, and allow special radios for motorcycles, snowmobiles, boats, undercover activities and smoke diving. Communication can either be performed as one-to-one conversations, group calls for predefined or ad-hoc groups, with radios able {{to be part of}} several groups, or as walkie talkies in areas without network coverage. The <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> reduced background noise and allows monitoring terminal identity to prohibit unauthorized use. All radios are equipped with an emergency button that will give priority in the network.|$|E

25|$|On 5 May 2011, Analogue {{television}} transmissions ceased in {{most areas}} of regional Victoria and some border regions including Albury-Wodonga. All local free-to-air television services are now broadcasting in <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> only.

25|$|On T-carrier <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> systems, bits {{within the}} T-1 data stream {{were used to}} {{transmit}} supervision. By careful design, the appropriated bits did not change voice quality appreciably. Robbed bits were translated to changes in contact states (opens and closures) by electronics in the channel bank hardware. This allowed direct current E and M signaling, or dial pulses, to be sent between electromechanical switches over a digital carrier which did not have DC continuity.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{objectives of}} converting to <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> were to enable higher fidelity, more stations and more resistance to noise, co-channel interference and multipath than in analogue FM radio. However, the leading countries in implementing DAB on stereo radio stations use compression {{to such a}} degree that it produces lower sound quality than that received from non-mobile FM broadcasts. This is because of the bit rate levels being too low for the MPEG Layer 2 audio codec to provide high fidelity audio quality.|$|E

25|$|For its {{transmission}} speed, RTTY has low spectral efficiency. The typical RTTY signal with 170Hz {{shift at}} 45.45 baud requires around 250Hz receiver bandwidth, {{more than double}} that required by PSK31. In theory, at this baud rate, the shift size can be decreased to 22.725Hz, reducing the overall band footprint substantially. Because RTTY, using either AFSK or FSK modulation, produces a waveform with constant power, a transmitter {{does not need to}} use a linear amplifier, which is required for many <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> modes. A more efficient Class C amplifier may be used.|$|E

This was also the first new presentation package not to include a clock though one had been designed — it had become difficult to transmit the time accurately, given the delay introduced by satellites and <b>digital</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|E
25|$|Apart from {{restoring}} staff morale, Dyke laid {{claim to}} two major achievements during his office.

Previously this was an ITV subscription service that had closed with major losses, but by mid-2007 it could be seen {{by more than half}} the population. After leaving the BBC, he said that he always realised that the introduction of Freeview helped to prevent a subscription funding model for the BBC gain traction, because it is impossible for broadcasters to switch off the signal to individual Freeview boxes.|$|E

25|$|The {{concepts}} of digital switching {{were developed by}} various labs in the United States and in Europe from the 1930s onwards. The first prototype digital switch was developed by Bell Labs {{as part of the}} ESSEX project while the first true digital exchange to be combined with <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> systems was designed by LCT (Laboratoire Central de Telecommunications) in Paris. The first digital switch to be placed into a public network was the Empress Exchange in London, England which was designed by the General Post Office research labs. This was a tandem switch that connected three Strowger exchanges in the London area. The first commercial roll-out of a fully digital local switching system was Alcatel's E10 system which began serving customers in Brittany in Northwestern France in 1972.|$|E
25|$|Next, {{detailed}} information booklets were delivered to all {{households in the}} area (including many on the fringe {{who may have been}} receiving their TV from other transmitters- hence the importance of the on-screen warning captions). Two or three months later, the first stage of the switchover began with the analogue BBC Two replaced with the new BBC A multiplex. At some locations, during the period between stage one and stage two, BBC One, ITV or Channel 4 moved to the analogue BBC Two frequency where that channel's frequency was required for the <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> of Multiplex 1. At the same time, captions appeared on the remaining analogue channels reminding viewers of the impending switchover. Finally, the second stage saw the remaining analogue transmissions switched off and the other high power multiplexes switched on. Initially, this occurred four weeks after stage one, but starting with the switchover at Mendip in April 2010 onwards, this gap was reduced to two weeks.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of regional offices {{and resulted in}} the microwave radio relay being upgraded in the 1970s. The Telecommunications Administration insisted on continuing using analog transmission, while NRK instead wanted to implement a <b>digital</b> <b>transmission.</b> NRK got its way, and a transistor-based system with a capacity corresponding to 960 telephone lines was installed. The resulting system had two radio channels, one for transmitting radio from Oslo to the regional offices and one for transmission between the regional offices. The FM transmitters were fed their programs from the regional offices. The system had a two-way television channel, which could feed the television programs to the transmitters and allow for transfer of program content from the regional offices to Oslo. The sound transfer system had four 2-megabit channels; the one was used for 30 telephone lines {{and the other was}} used for 5 program channels. These had a sampling rate of 32kHz and a 14-bit bit rate, which was reduced to 11 through compression. No other available systems could produce this quality of audio.|$|E

500|$|The {{broadcast}} media industry is {{at a critical}} turning point in its development, with many countries moving from analog to digital broadcasts. This move is {{made possible by the}} production of cheaper, faster and more capable integrated circuits. The chief advantage of digital broadcasts is that they prevent a number of complaints common to traditional analog broadcasts. For television, this includes the elimination of problems such as snowy pictures, ghosting and other distortion. These occur {{because of the nature of}} analog transmission, which means that perturbations due to noise will be evident in the final output. <b>Digital</b> <b>transmission</b> overcomes this problem because digital signals are reduced to discrete values upon reception and hence small perturbations do not affect the final output. In a simplified example, if a binary message 1011 was transmitted with signal amplitudes [...] and received with signal amplitudes [...] it would still decode to the binary message 1011 — a perfect reproduction of what was sent. From this example, a problem with digital transmissions can also be seen in that if the noise is great enough it can significantly alter the decoded message. Using forward error correction a receiver can correct a handful of bit errors in the resulting message but too much noise will lead to incomprehensible output and hence a breakdown of the transmission.|$|E
