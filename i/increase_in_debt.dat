The study defines the release from the crisis as a transformation from a Non-Ricardian economic structure to a Ricardian one. Dummy variables have been employed in the analysis in order to find out whether there has existed such a transformation through the stability programs implemented since the year 2000. As a result, it has been found that the process of borrowing of Turkey is Non-Ricardian, and Turkey has not got out of the crisis yet...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the effect of}} {{investor}} level taxes, firm-specific ownership structure and firm-specific payout policy on firms' capital structure choice. Our analysis is based on data for 10, 983 firms from 13 Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries over the time period 2002 - 2012. Our results show a significant impact of the net tax benefit of debt on the debt ratio of firms. Ignoring firm heterogeneity, an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the net tax benefit of debt by 10 percentage points leads to an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the <b>debt</b> ratio of 2. 49 percentage points. Taking into account investor-level taxation and firm heterogenity, an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the net tax benefit of debt of 10 percentage points leads to an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the <b>debt</b> ratio of only 1. 27 percentage points, if the firm's largest individual domestic owner has more than 50 % of the shares.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} managerial discretion on capital structure dynamics. Analyses of financing decisions indicate that managers with more discretion prefer issuing equity over debt. Examination of leverage changes suggests that <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>debt</b> ratios due to positive and negative financial deficits are greater for managers with high discretion. Furthermore, when managers have high‐ discretion, debt changes {{seem to be more}} sensitive to issuance activities than to repurchase activities. For high‐discretion managers, market timing activities (equity issuance following <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> stock prices) and the passive response to stock price appreciations, result in greater declines <b>in</b> <b>debt</b> ratios. Finally, while firms tend to rebalance their capital structures over time regardless of the level of managerial discretion, the speed of target adjustment is much slower for high‐discretion managers...|$|R

The increase in State Expenditure is needed because of three main reasons. Wagner himself identified these as (i) social activities of the state, (ii) administrative and protective actions, and (iii) welfare functions. The material below is an apparently much more generous interpretation of Wagner's original premise.* Socio-political, i.e., the state social functions expand over time: retirement insurance, natural disaster aid (either internal or external), environmental protection programs, etc.* Economic: science and technology advance, consequently there is an increase of state assignments into the sciences, technology and various investment projects, etc.* Historical: the state resorts to government loans for covering contingencies, and thus the sum of government debt and interest amount grow; i.e., it is an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>debt</b> service expenditure.|$|E
