The basis of methods, characteristics of sources of external irradiation and used preparations, and stages of development of technologies are described. The development and implementation of binary technologies attract a great number of researchers but are restrained by the shortage of operating sources of <b>epithermal</b> neutrons (<b>reactors,</b> neutron generators based on accelerators) and the lack of accurate radiation dosimetry planning systems that takes into account the dynamics and accumulation of drugs in tumors...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of instrumental neutron activation analysis, principally employing short-lived isotopes, to archaeological and environmental studies is described. Techniques {{for the production}} and measurement of short-lived isotopes using a reactor facility are discussed and evaluated {{for a variety of}} sample matrices by the estimation of elemental detection limits. Cyclic activation analysis, ideally suited for the measurement of isotopes with tau&frac 12; < 60 s, is considered and optimised with respect to the 'signal-to-noise' ratio of a radionuclide of interest. The potential of the technique, in the low energy photon region (< 250 keV), is demonstrated by determination of elemental sensitivities in a variety of biological materials. In an environmental study of Oxford City-Centre, the analysis of air particulates provides results for 8 time-varying elemental concentrations. Correlations are drawn between these elements, traffic flow, filter obscuration and meteorological data, also the concentrations of 5 hydrocarbons measured by gas chromatography. The suitability of thermal, <b>epithermal</b> and <b>reactor</b> neutrons is investigated for the measurement of bulk, minor and trace elements in soils. The most appropriate method is then applied to the study of variations in elemental concentration with soil depth, for the purpose of locating buried soils of archaeological significance. These results are compared with additional physical measurements performed on the soils, such as loss on ignition and particle size determination. The technique of cluster analysis is described and employed to aid interpretation of the multi-elemental results obtained. A method is devised, employing cyclic activation, for the estimation of fluorine, through the 20 F isotope (tau&frac 12; ~ 11 s), in a bone matrix. Corrections are applied to eliminate the interference from a fast neutron reaction of sodium. The technique is proven to be multi-elemental, more than 10 elements per biological matrix being detected. Finally, the method is discussed in relation to its potential application for the dating of ancient bone, where the multi-elemental capability is an advantage...|$|R
40|$|Using purely {{instrumental}} methods, a comparative study is presented on {{neutron activation analysis}} of rock and soil samples by whole reactor neutron spectrum and epithermal neutrons with both relative and monostandard procedures. The latter procedure used with epithermal neutron activation analysis of soil samples necessitated {{the use of the}} "effective resonance integrals" which were determined experimentally. The incorporation of the β factor, representing deviation of <b>reactor</b> <b>epithermal</b> neutron flux from 1 /Elaw, is developed in the present work.

40|$|We reanalyze Oklo ^ 149 Sm data using {{realistic}} {{models of}} the natural nuclear reactors. Disagreements among recent Oklo determinations of the time evolution of α, the electromagnetic fine structure constant, are shown {{to be due to}} different reactor models, which led to different neutron spectra used in the calculations. We use known Oklo <b>reactor</b> <b>epithermal</b> spectral indices as criteria for selecting realistic reactor models. Two Oklo reactors, RZ 2 and RZ 10, were modeled with MCNP. The resulting neutron spectra were used to calculate the change in the ^ 149 Sm effective neutron capture cross section as a function of a possible shift in the energy of the 97. 3 -meV resonance. We independently deduce ancient ^ 149 Sm effective cross sections, and use these values to set limits on the time-variation of α. Our study resolves a contradictory situation with previous Oklo α-results. Our suggested 2 σ bound on a possible time variation of α over two billion years is stringent: - 0. 24 × 10 ^- 7 <Δα/α< 0. 11 × 10 ^- 7, but model dependent in that it assumes only α has varied over time.

40|$|A major {{modification}} of and addition to existing Closed Brayton Cycle (CBC) space power system optimization codes was completed. These modifications {{relate to the}} global minimum mass search driver programs containing three nested iteration loops comprising iterations on cycle temperature ratio, and three separate pressure ratio iteration loops [...] one loop for maximizing thermodynamic efficiency, one for minimizing radiator area, and a final loop for minimizing overall power system mass. Using the method of steepest ascent, the code sweeps through the pressure ratio space repeatedly, each time with smaller iteration step sizes, so that the three optimum pressure ratios can be obtained to any desired accuracy {{for each of the}} objective functions referred to above (i. e., maximum thermodynamic efficiency, minimum radiator area, and minimum system mass). Two separate options for the power system heat source are available: 1. A nuclear fission reactor can be used. It is provided with a radiation shield 1. (composed of a lithium hydride (LiH) neutron shield and tungsten (W) gamma shield). Suboptions can be used to select the type of reactor (i. e., fast spectrum liquid metal cooled or <b>epithermal</b> high-temperature gas <b>reactor</b> (HTGR)). 2. A solar heat source can be used. This option includes a parabolic concentrator and heat receiver for raising the temperature of the recirculating working fluid. A useful feature of the code modifications is that key cycle parameters are displayed, including the overall system specific mass in kilograms per kilowatt and the system specific power in watts per kilogram, as the results for each temperature ratio are computed. As the minimum mass temperature ratio is encountered, a message is printed out. Several levels of detailed information on cycle state points, subsystem mass results, and radiator temperature profiles are stored for this temperature ratio condition and can be displayed or printed by users...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{feasibility}} of designing Seed and Blanket (S&B) Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) to generate a significant fraction of the core power from radial thorium fueled blankets that operate on the Breed-and-Burn (B&B) mode without exceeding the 200 Displacements per Atom (DPA) radiation damage constraint of presently verified cladding materials. The S&B core is designed to have an elongated seed (or “driver”) to maximize the fraction of neutrons that radially leak into the subcritical blanket and reduce neutron loss via axial leakage. The blanket in the S&B core makes beneficial use of the leaking neutrons for improved economics and resource utilization. A specific objective {{of this study is}} to maximize the fraction of core power that can be generated by the blanket without violating the thermal hydraulic and material constraints. Since the blanket fuel requires no reprocessing along with remote fuel fabrication, a larger fraction of power from the blanket will result in a lower fuel cycle cost per unit of electricity generated. A unique synergism is found between a low conversion ratio (CR) seed and a B&B blanket fueled by thorium. Among several benefits, this synergism enables the very low leakage S&B cores to have small positive coolant voiding reactivity coefficient and large enough negative Doppler coefficient even when using inert matrix fuel for the seed. The benefits of this synergism are maximized when using an annular seed surrounded by an inner and outer thorium blankets. Two high-performance S&B cores were designed to benefit from this unique synergism: (1) the ultra-long cycle core that features a cycle length of ~ 7 years; (2) the high-transmutation rate core where the seed fuel features a TRU CR of 0. 0. Its TRU transmutation rate is comparable to that of the reference Advanced Burner Reactor (ABR) with CR of 0. 5 and the thorium blanket can generate close to 60 % of the core power; but requires only one sixth of the reprocessing and fabrication capacity per unit of core power. Nevertheless, these reference cores were designed to set upper bounds on the S&B core performance by using larger height and pressure drop than those of typical SFR design. A study was subsequently undertaken to quantify the tradeoff between S&B core design variables and the core performance. This study concludes that a viable S&B core can be designed without significant deviation from SFR core design practices. For example, the S&B core with 120 cm active height will be comparable in volume, HM mass and specific power with the S-PRISM core and could fit within the S-PRISM reactor vessel. 43. 1 % of this core power will be generated by the once-through thorium blanket; the required capacity for reprocessing and remote fuel fabrication per unit of electricity generated will be approximately one fifth of that for a comparable ABR. The sodium void worth of this 120 cm tall S&B core is significantly less positive than that of the reference ABR and the Doppler coefficient is only slightly smaller even though the seed uses a fertile-free fuel. The seed in the high transmutation core requires inert matrix fuel (TRU- 40 Zr) that has been successfully irradiated by the Fuel Cycle Research & Development program. An additional sensitivity analysis was later conducted to remove the bias introduced by the discrepancy between radiation damage constraints [...] 200 DPA applied for S&B cores and fast fluence of 4 x 1023 n(> 0. 1 MeV) /cm 2 applied for ABR core design. Although the performance characteristics of the S&B cores are sensitive to the radiation damage constraint applied, the S&B cores offer very significant performance improvements relative to the conventional ABR core design when using identical constraint. Fuel cycle characteristics of the S&B cores were compared with those of the reference ABR, and a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). The fuel cycle cost of the S&B reactor with same LWR TRU transmutation rate as the reference (CR= 0. 5) ABR is 0. 53 cents/kWe-h versus 0. 73 cents/kWe-h for the ABR – about 27 % lower; it is even lower than that of contemporary PWRs. The longer cycle may enable the S&B cores to operate at a ~ 10 % higher capacity factor and thereby further improve their economic viability. The S&B cores can utilize at least 7 % of thorium energy value without a need to develop irradiated thorium reprocessing capability. This is ~ 12 times the amount of energy that the LWRs generate per unit of natural uranium mined. By softening the blanket spectrum the thorium utilization can increase by a factor of at least three when using thorium hydride rather than metallic fuel; Fully Ceramic Encapsulated (FCM) fueled blanket can achieve the discharge burnup of 481. 5 MWd/kg if the FCM fuel keeps its integrity up to such burnup – this is over 80 times the energy extracted by present PWR per unit mass of natural uranium. If reprocessed, the Trans-Th fuel bred in the S&B core can enable to support new fleets of 233 U-Th fuel self-sustaining energy systems that use thermal and <b>epithermal</b> <b>reactors</b> such as Molten Salt Reactors (MSR) and Reduced-moderation Boiling Water Reactors (RBWR). Alternatively, the S&B reactors can be used to close the LWR fuel cycle using a 3 -tier system: TRU extracted from Tier- 1 LWR is used for fueling the seed of Tier- 2 S&B cores while the 233 U (Trans-Th) extracted from Tier- 2 S&B blanket is used as the fissile feed for Tier- 3 LWR. It is estimated that in such a 3 -tier energy system 1 GWe of S&B SFRs can support 3. 3 GWe of PWRs versus ~ 1. 7 GWe of PWRs that can be supported by 1 GWe of CR= 0. 5 ABR. In summary, the Seed-and-Blanket core concept studied in this project is found highly promising as it offers:•	Improvement in the economic viability of Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors due to the significant reduction in the fuel cycle cost and possibly increase in the capacity factor that may be enabled by the longer cycles. The improved economics may justify earlier commercialization of SFRs. •	Significantly smaller investment in the construction of the fuel reprocessing and the remote fuel fabrication infrastructure required for a given capacity of SFRs. •	Several new promising fuel cycle options feature substantial increase of the thorium resource utilization without fuel reprocessing•	Supporting a large number of LWRs by a given capacity of SFRs on the S&B configuration. Thus, it enables to close the nuclear fuel cycle faster and with smaller investment. In conclusion, the S&B reactor concept we proposed is feasible and potential to significantly improve the economic viability of fast reactors and of LWR TRU transmuting system using existing structural materials. It enables significant utilization of thorium resource without reprocessing...|$|R
