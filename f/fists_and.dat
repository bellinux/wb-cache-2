5|$|A {{crowd of}} several {{thousand}} gathered outside the courthouse while Lockett's trial was underway. A cameraman asked {{a large group of}} those gathered to shake their <b>fists</b> <b>and</b> yell so he could get a picture. The rest of the crowd mistakenly believed they were storming the courthouse and rushed forward. In the ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured so badly that his arm later had to be amputated. The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty. Some members of the mob looted nearby stores in search of weapons to retaliate, but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon. Martial law was declared, and no further violence was perpetrated. A month later, Lockett was executed at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville.|$|E

5|$|Stanley Frederick Gibbs, GC (2 January 1909 – 3 March 1991) was an Australian {{shipping}} clerk and an exchange {{recipient of the}} George Cross, the highest civil decoration for heroism in the United Kingdom and formerly in the Commonwealth. On 3 January 1927, {{the day after his}} eighteenth birthday, Gibbs went to the rescue of 15-year-old Mervyn Allum during a shark attack at Port Hacking, New South Wales. He managed to fend off the shark by striking at it with his legs and <b>fists</b> <b>and,</b> with the assistance of a friend, pulled Allum clear of the water. Although Alllum died from his injuries, Gibbs was publicly praised by the coroner and local community leaders for his actions, and was subsequently awarded the Albert Medal.|$|E

25|$|The {{alliance}} {{of the three}} aspects of Juno finds a strictly related parallel to the Lupercalia in the festival of the Nonae Caprotinae. On that day the Roman free and slave women picnicked and had fun together {{near the site of}} the wild fig (caprificus): the custom implied runs, mock battles with <b>fists</b> <b>and</b> stones, obscene language and finally the sacrifice of a male goat to Juno Caprotina under a wildfig tree and with the using of its lymph.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} The Rolling Stones took stage, {{numerous}} incidents of violence had occurred both between the Hells Angels and internally within the crowd, {{not the least}} of which featured a circus performer weighing over 350 pounds stripping naked and running amok amid the concertgoers. Audience members attempted to detain him. Eventually, the irate man was subdued after Angels intervened with <b>fists</b> <b>and</b> makeshift weapons, while a crowd of 4,000–5,000 looked on from the edge of the stage.|$|E
25|$|Martial arts {{were not}} {{exclusive}} to the kshatriya caste, though the warrior class used them more extensively. The 8th-century text Kuvalaymala by Udyotanasuri recorded fighting techniques being taught at educational institutions, where non-kshatriya students {{from throughout the}} subcontinent “were learning and practicing archery, fighting with sword and shield, with daggers, sticks, lances, and with <b>fists,</b> <b>and</b> in duels (niyuddham)”. Hindu priests of the traditional gurukula still teach unarmed fighting techniques to their students {{as a way of}} increasing stamina and training the physical body.|$|E

25|$|Classical Sanskrit epics {{contain the}} {{earliest}} written accounts of combat in India. The term dwandwayuddha {{referred to a}} duel, such {{that it was a}} battle between only two warriors and not armies. The Mahabharata describes a prolonged battle between Arjuna and Karna using bows, swords, trees and rocks, and fists. Stories describing Krishna report that he sometimes engaged in wrestling matches where he used knee strikes to the chest, punches to the head, hair pulling, and strangleholds. Another unarmed battle in the Mahabharata describes two fighters boxing with clenched <b>fists</b> <b>and</b> fighting with kicks, finger strikes, knee strikes and headbutts. Krishna Maharaja, who single-handedly overcame an elephant according to the Mahabharata, is credited with developing the sixteen principles of armed combat.|$|E
25|$|Additionally to the Five <b>Fists</b> <b>and</b> animal shapes, many {{lineages}} {{employ the}} training of several additional movement forms - from a handful to a few dozen. Some of the more common forms are partner forms, which simulate combat scenarios. Once the individual animal shapes are taught, a student is often taught an animal linking form (shi'er xing lianhuan) which connects all the taught animals together in a sequence. Some styles have longer, or multiple forms for individual animals, such Eight Tiger Forms Huxing bashi. Other forms often link movements from the Five Fists, the different animal shapes, or both, and commonly include additional movements and techniques not found elsewhere. There also exist a Ba Zi Gong linking form and many weapons forms.|$|E
25|$|There are {{numerous}} boxes, barrels, and other smashables {{scattered around the}} levels. Most contain fairy dust for use in special attacks, but a few contain coins and food. Coins are of either gold or red colors (called Far Far Pounds). In addition to the aforementioned smashables, a source of Far Far Pounds can often be just finding them scattered around, as well as under certain circumstances, enemies. Gold coins are worth 3 pounds and red coins are worth 10 pounds. The player has to fight with <b>fists</b> <b>and</b> swords against multiple enemies, like pirates, guards, athletes, evil trees, and witches, depending on the level the player is in. After an enemy has sustained several hits, a finishing move {{can be used on}} them, which, when activated, plays an animation of the currently selected character finishing off the enemy, defeating them instantly, as well as causing them to drop special purple fairy dust. Felled enemies will drop fairy dust that will fill up the three-part special attack meter.|$|E

25|$|Workers {{also had}} {{good reasons for}} discontent: overcrowded housing with often deplorable {{sanitary}} conditions, long hours at work (on {{the eve of the}} war a 10-hour workday six days a week was the average and many were working 11–12 hours a day by 1916), constant risk of injury and death from poor safety and sanitary conditions, harsh discipline (not only rules and fines, but foremen's <b>fists),</b> <b>and</b> inadequate wages (made worse after 1914 by steep wartime increases in the cost of living). At the same time, urban industrial life was full of benefits, though these could be just as dangerous, {{from the point of view}} of social and political stability, as the hardships. There were many encouragements to expect more from life. Acquiring new skills gave many workers a sense of self-respect and confidence, heightening expectations and desires. Living in cities, workers encountered material goods such as they had never seen in villages. Most important, living in cities, they were exposed to new ideas about the social and political order.|$|E
25|$|On September 7, the Shinyō Maru was sailing for Manila in convoy C-076 {{with seven}} other vessels, {{including}} two torpedo boats, two tankers, {{and four other}} medium and small cargo ships. They were sailing two to three miles off the Lanboyan Point of Zamboanga Peninsula {{on the island of}} Mindanao, when the USS Paddle found them. A few days previously, American intelligence had reported the Shinyō Maru to be carrying Japanese soldiers, so they assigned Paddle to search for it. The Paddle, under the command of Captain Byron Nowell, was 10 miles away when the Japanese were first spotted, so Nowell maneuvered forward to attack with torpedoes. A spread of four was then released {{in the direction of the}} Shinyō Maru, which was the leading ship in the convoy. Two of the torpedoes struck, both in the hold, and a few moments later the Paddle was lined up against one of the cargo ships. It, too, was struck by two torpedoes, so her commander grounded her on the nearby shore to prevent the ship from sinking. Just after the Shinyō Maru was hit, the guards opened fire on the prisoners with captured Thompson submachine guns, though several of the men fought their way out of the hold, with their <b>fists</b> <b>and</b> improvised weapons, and abandoned ship.|$|E
25|$|Tyrone Dobbs {{was also}} the centre of a {{domestic}} abuse storyline when he was introduced to police officer Kirsty Soames whilst on a night out. Tyrone and Kirsty immediately hit it off. Kirsty's temper began to show when she used to become jealous of Tyrone's friends, specifically his friendship with Fiz Stape. Kirsty fell pregnant and her temper soon turned violent as she lashed out at Tyrone on numerous occasions, attacking him with her <b>fists</b> <b>and</b> kitchen appliances. Tyrone hid his injuries from his concerned friends and refused to leave the house. Kirsty gave birth in the Rovers Return after a heated confrontation with Tina, yet Tyrone was absent due to him fixing Fiz's boiler. This made Kirsty secretly leave out Tyrone's name as their newborn daughter Ruby's father on the birth certificate. Kirsty's violent outbursts become more frequent and a terrified Tyrone finally confides in a horrified Fiz about Kirsty's domestic abuse, this leads to Tyrone and Fiz embarking on a secret affair after she confesses her love for him. Fiz and Tyrone conspire a plan together for Tyrone to wed Kirsty then report Kirsty to the police for her domestic abuse, resulting in Kirsty being sent to prison and Tyrone getting full custody of his daughter Ruby. Tyrone proposes to a delighted Kirsty, but Kirsty eventually discovers his affair with Fiz, and their plan. Kirsty eventually reveals Fiz and Tyrone's affair {{in front of everybody}} at her and Tyrone's wedding. After the wedding, Kirsty and Tyrone have a blazing row back at their house, resulting in Kirsty falling down the stairs after trying to attack Tyrone. The row is overheard by several neighbours and they think Tyrone has been assaulting Kirsty and call the police. Kirsty lies to the police and makes a false accusation that Tyrone has been beating her for months. This leads to Tyrone's arrest and he is bailed until his appending trial. Whilst on bail, Tyrone flees Weatherfield with Fiz, her daughter Hope and his daughter Ruby causing the police to issue a warrant for his arrest. Tyrone is caught and arrested. Kirsty lies again whilst giving evidence at Tyrone's trial by playing the victim to the jury. But whilst struggling being a single mum at home, Kirsty snaps at a screaming Ruby and starts screaming at her child to stop crying. Realising that she does not trust herself around her daughter, Kirsty interrupts Tyrone's trial and confesses to the judge that it was her who had been assaulting Tyrone and he was innocent. Tyrone gets released and Kirsty gets charged and is sentenced to three years in prison. Tyrone gets full custody of Ruby and starts his new life with his girlfriend Fiz.|$|E

500|$|Beyond this, Jack Warner {{was shaken}} by the 1936 murder of studio {{salesman}} Joe Kaufman, who was beaten to death by Nazi stormtroopers in Berlin. Warner later described the incident in the following terms: [...] "Like many an outnumbered Jew he was trapped in an alley. They [...] hit him with <b>fists</b> <b>and</b> clubs and then kicked {{the life out of}} him with their boots and left him dying there." [...] Hence, while other Hollywood studios sidestepped the issue, fearing domestic criticism and the loss of European markets, Warner Brothers produced films that were openly critical of Nazi Germany.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Cleveland's {{crime rate}} were 84 murders, 3,252 robberies, and 9,740 burglaries. In 2014, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) {{published}} {{a report that}} investigated {{the use of force}} by the Cleveland Police Department from 2010–2013. [...] The Justice Department found a pattern of excessive force including the use of firearms, tasers, <b>fists,</b> <b>and</b> chemical spray that unnecessarily escalated nonviolent situations, including against the mentally ill and people who were already restrained. [...] As a result of the Justice Department report, the city of Cleveland has agreed to a consent decree to revise its policies and implement new independent oversight over the police force.|$|E
500|$|Computer-controlled players, called [...] "Simulants", can be {{included}} in multiplayer matches. The appearance, team affiliation, skill level and playing characteristics of each Simulant can be individually customised; each Simulant can be assigned pre-set behaviours, such as a tendency to pursue the highest-scoring player, or a restriction to only attack using <b>fists</b> <b>and</b> disarming moves instead of gunfire. On higher difficulty settings, Simulants perform actions at a superhuman level. In team games, players can issue allied Simulants with orders to perform certain tasks. The Combat Simulator also includes 30 [...] "Challenges", pre-set games against Simulants which may be tackled {{by one or more}} players. The Challenges cover a variety of game types, weapon arrangements and level setups. By completing Challenges, additional features such as new weapons, player models and Simulant difficulties are unlocked in the Combat Simulator. At the end of a match, the overall results are shown, alongside information about the individual players' performance: colour-coded awards divided into multiple categories based on armour damage, accuracy and ammunition usage are given to players based on their overall performance. Players are also ranked according to their performance: the better the performance, the higher the grade.|$|E
