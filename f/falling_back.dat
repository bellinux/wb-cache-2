5|$|Grenier {{directed}} his well-managed retreat {{along the road}} toward Haag, with all the units <b>falling</b> <b>back</b> in an orderly echelon. To save some artillery from capture, the 2nd Dragoons charged their pursuers and captured 100 Austrians. After <b>falling</b> <b>back</b> , the French soldiers reached the open ground around Haag, where they assumed a defensive position. All told, the battle lasted six hours. In addition to the Latour Dragoons, the most heavily engaged Austrian units were the Archduke Charles Infantry Regiment (IR) # 3 and the Waldeck Dragoons # 7 from Riesch's column, plus IR # 60 and the Vecsey Hussars # 4 from Johann Kollowrat's column.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fall</b> <b>back</b> {{equilibrium}} is a {{refinement of}} the Nash equilibrium concept. In the underly- ing thought experiment each player faces the possibility that, after all players decided on their action, his chosen action {{turns out to}} be blocked. Therefore, each player has to decide beforehand on a back-up action, which he plays in case he is unable to play his primary action. In this paper we introduce the concept of <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> equilibrium and show that the set of <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> equilibria is a non-empty and closed subset of the set of Nash equilibria. We discuss the relations with other equilibrium concepts, and among other results it is shown that each robust equilibrium is <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> and for bimatrix games also each proper equilibrium is a <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> equilibrium. Furthermore, we show that for bimatrix games the set of <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> equilibria is the union of finitely many polytopes, and that the notions of <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> equilibrium and strictly <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> equilibrium coincide. Finally, we allow multiple actions to be blocked, resulting in the notion of complete <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> equilibrium. We show that the set of complete <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> equilibria is a non-empty and closed subset of the set of proper equilibria. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{population}} of Shepton Mallet was fairly stable through the 19th {{century and the}} first part of the 20th: in 1801, it was 5,104 and in 1851 only slightly more at 5,117, although by 1901 it had swelled to 5,446, before <b>falling</b> <b>back</b> to 5,260 in 1951.

5|$|American forces boarded Diana {{and rapidly}} removed {{everything}} of value, including guns, rigging, sails, clothing, and money. They laid hay under the stern {{to serve as}} kindling, and the vessel was set on fire at about 3 am {{to prevent it from}} <b>falling</b> <b>back</b> into British hands. The guns recovered were probably used in the American positions during the Battle of Bunker Hill.|$|E
5|$|At the start, Hamilton {{assumed the}} lead while a three-car wide tussle at turn one, {{involving}} Kimi Räikkönen, Felipe Nasr and Pastor Maldonado, resulted in Maldonado crashing out at turn two and race officials deploying the safety car. The next lap, Romain Grosjean's car failed thus taking both Lotus cars {{out of the}} race. Normal racing resumed on lap four, with Carlos Sainz Jr. <b>falling</b> <b>back</b> from fifth to his starting position in seventh place after being passed by Nasr and Daniel Ricciardo. Nasr also lost track position after being ordered by his team to relinquish a position for overtaking while still under safety car conditions.|$|E

5|$|In {{what became}} the first major battle of the campaign, the two sides fought a heavy {{engagement}} around Isurava in late August, as four Australian infantry battalions attempted to fend off attacks by a similarly sized Japanese force. On {{the other side of}} Eora Creek, clashes were fought around Abuari, as a Japanese battalion attempted to outflank the Australians at Isurava from the west, and cut the track around Alola, while another Japanese battalion attempted to flank Isurava to the west. Subjected to a heavy Japanese artillery bombardment, and lacking their own with which to counter this indirect fire, the Australians defended for four days, before conducting a withdrawal in contact, <b>falling</b> <b>back</b> towards Templeton's Crossing, which was the scene of further fighting in early September 1942.|$|E
5|$|Maggie {{asks the}} group for help to remove a bloated walker that fell into a {{freshwater}} well before it contaminates the water. Glenn (Steven Yeun) is lowered down and saddles the walker with rope to pull it out, but as the group pulls it out, its body is ripped in half, its lower half <b>falling</b> <b>back</b> into the well and contaminating it. Maggie and Glenn decide to venture to the local pharmacy to find more supplies. Before he leaves, Lori asks Glenn to find a pregnancy test for her. At the pharmacy, Glenn is flustered with Lori's request, and Maggie seduces and has sex with him before they return.|$|E
5|$|Melting of {{floating}} ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) {{does not in}} itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow <b>falling</b> <b>back</b> onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.|$|E

5|$|On 20 December, Canadian forces {{tried again}} and The Royal Canadian Regiment {{attacked}} Cider Crossroads at noon. This time, Vokes {{was determined that}} the operation would be successful, with armoured forces of the Three Rivers Regiment moving to the start lines well before 07:00. Due to shortages of fuel and poor weather, H-Hour was postponed until 14:15. When H-Hour came, a powerful creeping barrage supported two companies of the Royal Canadian Regiment eastward. By evening, B Company controlled the Cider Crossroads, having met virtually no resistance in their advance to the objective. However, German forces had already evacuated The Gully, <b>falling</b> <b>back</b> {{to prepare for a}} strong defence of Ortona, with elements of the powerful 1st Parachute Division firmly entrenched in the town.|$|E
5|$|On lap 121 Kyle Busch {{took the}} lead, losing it to Jeff Gordon two laps later. Within a lap Gordon lost {{the draft and}} fell back to 27th, {{allowing}} Kenseth to regain the lead. On lap 127 Clint Bowyer passed Kenseth, holding the lead for two laps until a second yellow flag was displayed due to debris. Hamlin and Michael Waltrip staggered their pit stops, enabling each of them to lead a lap under the caution. Bowyer regained the lead after Waltrip stopped, and the race restarted on lap 134. Kenseth moved back into the lead on the next lap, with Bowyer <b>falling</b> <b>back</b> to tenth.|$|E
5|$|Stockport County {{joined the}} Football League in 1900 and competed in it {{continuously}} from 1905 to 2011. The team {{spent most of}} their history in the lower reaches of the Football League, but the 1990s were more successful with the club competing in the First Division (now known as the EFL Championship) for five seasons, whilst they also reached the League Cup semi-finals in 1996–97. However, instability on and off the pitch eventually led to Stockport <b>falling</b> <b>back</b> to the lower divisions. The club started the 2011–12 season in the Conference National, having been relegated from Football League Two {{for the first time in}} their history at the end of 2010–11. At the end of 2012–13, Stockport were relegated to the Conference North.|$|E

5|$|The coins quickly {{commanded}} a premium after their 1925 issue {{due to their}} scarcity, rising to $10 by 1928 before <b>falling</b> <b>back</b> to $7 by 1930, in uncirculated condition. They peaked at about $9 during the commemorative coin boom of 1936. They had subsided back to the $6 level by 1940, but thereafter increased steadily in value, rising to $1,600 during the second commemorative coin boom in 1980. The edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins published in 2017 lists the coin for between $300 and $975, depending on condition. A near-pristine specimen sold at auction in 2014 for $8,225.|$|E
5|$|As they advanced, the Australians came {{up against}} stiff resistance, as Japanese {{forces in the}} area fought hard to buy time for the forces <b>falling</b> <b>back</b> from Wareo by delaying the Australian advance. Initially, the 22nd's attack was turned back; however, fire support from {{artillery}} and armour helped overcome this opposition, and the advance continued with the 22nd and 29th/46th Infantry Battalions advancing in turns up the coast with the 37th/52nd moving on their left further inland. Lakona was reached on 14 December and, after finding the Japanese forces there to be positioned in strength, the 22nd Battalion worked its way around the town, enveloping the Japanese defenders and pushing {{them back to the}} cliffs, where on 16 December tanks were used to launch the final attack. After this, the 29th/46th took over the coastal advance to Fortification Point, which it reached alongside the 37th/52nd on 20 December, crossing the Masaweng River and gaining the high ground to its north.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Soult led a small force, some 150 musket-men, {{across the river}} Linth—the men held their muskets over their heads and waded across, through water to their chests—and {{protected}} the crossing site {{for the remainder of}} the force. Baron von Hotze, commander of the Austrian force there, advanced on the position near Richterswil to direct its defense, and was killed by a French musket ball. His successor, Franz Petrasch, could not push the French back, and organized a retreat from the region, <b>falling</b> <b>back</b> to St. Gallen and losing another 8,000 men and some guns. By the time Suvorov arrived in St. Gallen in early October, the Austrians and the Russians had been pushed out and he was forced to lead his men over the Alps to the Vorarlberg, resulting in additional losses.|$|E

5|$|Azmy {{lost contact}} with the 89th Battalion during the night, due to the {{intensity}} of Israeli bombardment on Touscan. At morning on October 21 the Israelis attacked again, and the paratroopers managed to repulse the attack again, before <b>falling</b> <b>back.</b> By dusk the battalion had abandoned the Touscan strong point and managed to retreat northward. Azmy had the 81st and 89th Battalions pulled back to the Ismailia Stadium, where {{they were to be}} reconstituted. The Israelis also attacked Heneidac at dawn that day using armor and infantry with air and artillery support, and captured the position before noon. The paratrooper company there pulled back north and joined the rest of the 85th Battalion at Jebel Mariam, now the only defensive position occupied by the 182nd Paratrooper Brigade, and the last position on the Suez Canal before Ismailia.|$|E
5|$|Breaking out {{of their}} newly {{established}} bridgehead west of the Canal at {{the northern end of}} the Great Bitter Lake, the IDF launched an offensive from Deversoir toward Ismailia. A combined force of Egyptian paratroopers and commandos fought a delaying battle, <b>falling</b> <b>back</b> upon defensive positions further north under increasing pressure from IDF infantry and armor. By October 22, they were occupying a last line of defense, including positions along the Ismailia canal. Though outnumbered, they repulsed a final Israeli effort to capture the city; a United Nations ceasefire was then imposed, bringing the battle to an end. The Egyptians registered a tactical and strategic victory in the defense of Ismailia, stopping an encirclement of their large forces on the east bank of the Suez Canal and ensuring their supply lines remained open.|$|E
5|$|By {{three in}} the afternoon, the British had reached a ravine known as Stockton Hollow, {{about a half a}} mile (0.8km) from Trenton where the Americans were forming another line of defense. Washington wanted to hold the British off until nightfall, when {{darkness}} would prevent the British from attacking his defenses {{on the south side of}} Assunpink Creek. The British, with artillery in position, attacked Hand's new position, and he gave way, slowly <b>falling</b> <b>back</b> into Trenton. Along the way, Hand had his troops fire from behind houses. As Hand's troops came to the creek, the Hessians charged at them with bayonets fixed, causing chaos among the Americans. Washington, seeing the chaos, rode out through the crowd of men crossing the bridge, and shouted that Hand's rear guard pull back and regroup under the cover of the American artillery.|$|E
