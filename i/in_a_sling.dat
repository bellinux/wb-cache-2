5|$|An {{alternate}} ending {{appears in}} the film's DVD version. After Captain Michaels (the Ark 4 captain) announces that they are heading for the Cape of Good Hope, Adrian receives a phone call. He answers the call, and is shocked to recognize the voice as his father's (Harry). Harry tells Adrian that he, his friend Tony (whose left arm is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sling)</b> and several others survived the megatsunami and are shipwrecked on an island. Adrian informs Captain Michaels of this and the Ark heads for them. Kate thanks Laura {{for taking care of}} Lilly, and Laura tells Jackson that she enjoyed his book. Jackson returns Noah's cell phone, which he recovered during the Ark 4 flood. Lilly says that she sees an island, and the ark finds the shipwrecked cruise ship Genesis and her survivors on a beach.|$|E
5|$|McCall played {{football}} for Upper Wortley Primary School and Thornhill Middle School, even scoring a winning {{goal for the}} latter in a cup final when he came on as a substitute with his arm <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sling.</b> While McCall also played table tennis as a schoolboy, football was a focus, and he captained the Leeds under-11 boys team and played for other Leeds representative sides. McCall's parents split and he made up for his size {{when he moved to}} one of Leeds' toughest estates and played for pub sides by the age of 14. He moved schools to Harrington High and also played for local young sides Pudsey Juniors, Holbeck and later Farsley Celtic. McCall thought he had missed his chance of playing professionally after a string of other players were signed by professional clubs, until Farsley played Bradford City's junior side in a friendly and he impressed coach Bryan Edwards enough to be asked for a trial.|$|E

The {{non-striker}} was Colin Cowdrey, who had his left arm <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sling,</b> having fractured it earlier in the day.

25|$|Doctors treat a {{dislocation}} {{by putting}} {{the head of the}} humerus back into the joint socket (glenoid fossa) of the scapula — a procedure called manipulation and reduction (M). This is usually followed up with an x ray to make sure the reduction did not fracture the surrounding bones. The arm is then immobilized <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sling</b> or a device called a shoulder immobilizer for several days. Usually the doctor recommends resting the shoulder and applying ice {{three or four times a}} day. After pain and swelling have been controlled, the patient enters a rehabilitation program that includes exercises to restore the range of motion of the shoulder and strengthen the muscles to prevent future dislocations. These exercises may progress from simple motion to the use of weights.|$|E
25|$|West Germany {{won their}} first three matches before facing England {{in the second}} round in a rematch of the 1966 final.

West Germany advanced to the semi-finals to face Italy, in what would be known as the Game of the Century. He dislocated his shoulder after being fouled, but he was not deterred from continuing in the match, as his side had already used their two permitted substitutions.

25|$|The band {{began its}} tour for One Hot Minute in Europe on September 27, 1995 and played 16 shows. A US tour was to follow but was {{postponed}} after Chad Smith broke his wrist. The band considered carrying {{on with the}} tour even at one point considering Jack Irons {{as a replacement for}} Smith but there just was not enough time to rehearse with anyone new and the dates were rescheduled for early 1996. The band spent most of 1996 playing shows in the United States and Europe. By 1997, for the first time, the band cancelled many shows. Most of this was again due to problems within the band. Flea at that point was exhausted, tired of playing the same songs each night and was seriously talking about quitting the band while Kiedis had recently been involved in a motorcycle accident which left one arm <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sling</b> and created yet another drug relapse due to his use of painkillers. Even Navarro was back to using drugs. 1997 saw the band playing just one show. This was at the very first Fuji Rock Festival on July 26, 1997. A massive typhoon hit that day but the band played anyway. They played through an 8-song set before having to cut the show short due to the storm. This would be the final show with Navarro and due to Flea's previous comments left many speculating if {{it was the end of}} the band.|$|E

25|$|Jackson, with 2,500 men, {{was ordered}} to crush the hostile Indians. On October 10, he {{set out on the}} expedition, his arm still <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sling.</b> Jackson {{established}} Fort Strother as a supply base. On November 3, Coffee defeated a band of Red Sticks at the Battle of Tallushatchee. Coming to the relief of friendly Creeks besieged by Red Sticks, Jackson won another decisive victory at the Battle of Talladega. In the winter, Jackson, encamped at Fort Strother, faced a severe shortage of troops due to the expiration of enlistments and chronic desertions. He sent Coffee with the cavalry (which abandoned him) back to Tennessee to secure more enlistments. Jackson decided to combine his force with that of the Georgia militia, and marched to meet the Georgia troops. From January 22–24, 1814, while on their way, the Tennessee militia and allied Muscogee were attacked by the Red Sticks at the Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek. Jackson's troops repelled the attackers, but outnumbered, were forced to withdraw to Fort Strother. Jackson, now with over 2,000 troops, marched most of his army south to confront the Red Sticks at a fortress they had constructed at a bend in the Tallapoosa River. On March 27, enjoying an advantage of more than 2 to 1, he engaged them at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. An initial artillery barrage did little damage to the well-constructed fort. However, a subsequent Infantry charge, in addition to an assault by Coffee's cavalry and diversions caused by the friendly Creeks, overwhelmed the Red Sticks.|$|E
