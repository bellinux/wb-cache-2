The physical aspects of tillage for plant growth involved aeration of a compact soil by increasing the volume fraction of air-filled pores and improving the permeability of the soil and a rather small influence on its temperature. Tilling caused more extreme temperatures of the aerial part of the plant and of the seed, if the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> was more than about twice the depth of sowing, and less extreme temperatures of the root zone.

Side-flow pump can largely reduce the liquid pressure load by more than 50 %, but its reduction effect for the polished rod load is very limited. When a conventional pump is substituted by a side-flow pump, both maximum and minimum polished rod loads are decreased by around 4 %. Deep pumping with small-diameter pump only reduces the liquid pressure load in upstroke, so only maximum polished rod load is decreased. The reduction effect depends {{on the size of}} the pump used. When a D 56  mm pump is replaced by a D 38  mm pump, the maximum polished rod load is decreased by about 11 %. Fiberglass sucker rod can greatly reduce the polished rod load in whole stroke by around 50 %. The reduction effect depends on the proportion of fiberglass sucker rod in a composite rod string.

The geometric model ‘electrode - a biological tissue’ was suggested to study the distribution of power and temperature fields in biological tissue during mono-polar coagulation. The model of biological tissue is represented as a cylinder and the needle electrode is an ellipsoid immersed in the biological tissue. The heat and quasi-electrostatics equations are used as a mathematical model. These equations are solved in Comsol Multiphysics environment. As a result, we have got the following findings: the technique of calculating parameters of the PAM acting signal which has a fixed carrier frequency for the needle electrode of a specified geometry and the immersion depth in biological tissues is suggested. Parameters of PAM signal are determined for this electrode geometry. These parameters provide a 60 [...] . 80 °C heating range of biological tissues near the <b>working</b> part <b>of</b> the tool for different amplitudes of acting signal during RF coagulation.

Parameter optimization of GM is formulated as the combinatorial optimization problem and would be solved collectively using PSO technique. The model can be optimized once the PSO finds the optimal parameters of GM. GM with this parameter optimization algorithm is then applied in UPWS forecasting.

The fundamental parameters which {{are used in the}} design and operation of trickle bed reactors are the dynamic liquid holdup and pressure drop.

Air- CMC system has been selected to understand and quantify the effect of viscosity on pressure drop and dynamic liquid holdup. By varying the liquid and gas flow rates along with viscosity, the pressure drop and dynamic liquid saturation changes were studied. Results from pressure drop plots indicate increase in pressure drop with increase in liquid and gas flow rate, while dynamic liquid saturation decreases with increase in air flow rate. It was also observed that pressure drop and dynamic liquid holdup increased with increasing the viscosity of the liquid solution.

40|$|A common way {{to present}} 3 D {{materials}} to human observers nowadays is by stereoscopic displaying on 3 D TVs or head-mounted displays {{such as the}} Oculus Rift. However, not everyone can see three-dimensional solid shape from stereoscopic viewing and the three-dimensional images remain two-dimensional pictures to them rather than solid shapes. Scientists and artists {{have spent a lot}} of effort in finding ways to dissolve pictorial space into visual space. In other words, they want to figure out how to create a sense of stereopsis in an observer when he or she is looking at non-stereo and stereo pictures. There are many monocular depth cues in addition to binocular disparity that can enhance depth perception, and these cues can therefore also create an impression of stereopsis when the viewing conditions are right. One <b>of</b> these <b>depth</b> cues is <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field. <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> field is defined as the distance range in which objects are perceived as sharp. <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> field is a popular photographic technique that effectively makes the main subject in a picture appear sharp and the foreground and background blurred. The goal of this thesis is to understand the roles <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field in pictures from a relatively low perceptual level to a relatively high cognitive level. This thesis mainly reveals how <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field influences the impression of stereopsis and how binocular disparity influences the perception <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field. I start the thesis with a study on the discrimination thresholds <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field. Then, a subjective study is reported in which I investigated the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on <b>depth</b> perception for binocular viewing. The next two studies address the roles <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on a more cognitive level. The first of these two studies explored the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on change detection in pictures. The other one was conducted to evaluate how <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field influences the aesthetic appeal and overall quality in photographs. Four subjective studies were conducted to achieve our goals. The cornerstone of the work described in this thesis is that humans are much more sensitive to changes in small <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field than in large <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field. A second important finding is that stereoscopic viewing does not significantly affect discrimination thresholds. Based on the discrimination thresholds that were measured in this study, I selected five levels <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field that can be well discriminated under stereo viewing conditions in the second study to explore the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on <b>depth</b> perception. I found that the presence <b>of</b> strong <b>depth</b> cues, in this case binocular disparity, weakens the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field as a depth cue when <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field is small. In contrast, when <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field is not small, perceived depth decreases with increasing <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field irrespective of whether binocular disparity is zero or not. With respect to the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on change detection, I found that <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field directs viewers' attention similarly under both non-stereo and stereo viewing conditions. <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> field does however weaken the effect of binocular disparity on change detection. In the final study, I found that there are no common rules on how to manipulate <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field to make pictures more beautiful or have higher quality. The role <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on aesthetic appeal and overall quality varies across content categories.
