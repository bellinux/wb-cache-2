5|$|His {{influence}} can {{as well be}} seen in Ecuadorian {{thought in}} general, as <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>has</b> been one of its principal influences; Ecuadorian education, as he promoted new pedagogical ideas, such as the creation of good citizens instead of merely imparting knowledge, and finally Ecuadorian science, as he was, along with Pedro Vicente Maldonado, {{one of the two}} most important scientists of colonial Ecuador.

5|$|Ketèlbey's {{popularity}} {{began to}} wane during the Second World War and his originality also declined; {{many of his}} post-war works were re-workings of older pieces and he increasingly found his music ignored by the BBC.

5|$|Leonardo's fame {{within his}} own {{lifetime}} was such that the King of France carried him away like a trophy, and was claimed to have supported him in his old age and held him in his arms as he died.

5|$|Lie is {{considered}} influential to the colony's journalism, linguistics, and literature. According to the Malaysian scholar Ahmad Adam, {{he is best}} remembered for his literary works. Several of his writings were printed multiple times, and Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari was adapted for the stage and screen. However, {{as a result of}} the language politics in the Indies and independent Indonesia, <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>has</b> become marginalised. When several of his writings were revealed as uncredited adaptations of existing works, Lie was criticised as unoriginal.

5|$|Marx {{has been}} {{described}} {{as one of the most}} influential figures in human history and <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>has</b> been both lauded and criticised.

Marx is typically cited as one of the principal architects of modern social science.|$|E

5|$|Allan Ramsay (1713–84) {{studied in}} Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh, where he {{established}} himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility. He undertook portraits of many of the major figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, including his friend the philosopher David Hume and the visiting Jean-Jacques Rousseau. After a second visit to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was Principal Painter in Ordinary to George III. He now focused on royal portraits, often presented by the king to ambassadors and colonial governors, but also more intimate works like that of Queen Charlotte and her Children (c. 1755). <b>His</b> <b>work</b> <b>has</b> been seen as anticipating the Grand Manner of Joshua Reynolds, but many of his early portraits, particularly of women, are less formal and more intimate studies.|$|E
