25|$|Some {{argue the}} court's high {{percentage}} of reversals is illusory, resulting from the circuit <b>hearing</b> <b>more</b> cases than the other circuits. This results in the Supreme Court reviewing a smaller proportion of its cases, letting stand {{the vast majority of}} its cases.|$|E
25|$|On September 13, Gutierrez filed a {{petition}} for certiorari and prohibition to the Supreme Court {{to stop the}} impeachment proceedings against her. Gutierrez cited the one-year ban <b>hearing</b> <b>more</b> than one impeachment proceedings. Tupas said that in a previous decision, the Supreme Court allowed two separate complaints initiated at the same time. The next day, the court granted Gutierrez a status quo ante order, or all parties should observe the conditions prior to the proceedings, thereby suspending impeachment proceedings against her.|$|E
25|$|Allen Crum, a 40-year-old retired Air Force tail gunner, was {{a manager}} at the University Book Store Co-Op. Across the street he saw a 17-year-old {{newspaper}} boy being dragged and went to break up {{what he thought was}} a fight. Learning the boy had been shot, and <b>hearing</b> <b>more</b> shots, Crum rerouted street traffic out of harm's way. Unable to make his way back to the store safely, he then made his way to the tower, where he offered to help the police. Inside the tower, he accompanied Department of Public Safety Agent Dub Cowan and Austin Police Officer Jerry Day up the elevator; Cowan provided Crum with a rifle.|$|E

500|$|Bradley Stern from PopCrush {{described}} the song as a [...] "shimmering, strut-friendly {{contribution to the}} soundtrack" [...] and praised Aguilera's [...] "mighty" [...] vocals. He noted that while the disco sound is not necessarily an insight into the creative direction of Aguilera's upcoming eighth studio album, {{he would not be}} opposed to <b>hearing</b> <b>more</b> collaborations between the singer, Rodgers and the song's co-writer, Sia Furler. Digital Spy writer Lewis Corner {{described the}} [...] "throwback" [...] song as a [...] "glittering disco track" [...] and that her [...] "massive vocals" [...] compliment the composition. Joey Nolfi of Entertainment Weekly described [...] "Telepathy" [...] as the [...] "funkiest" [...] release by Aguilera for several years. Fuse.tv called it one of the best songs of 2016.|$|E
500|$|The fourth {{concert was}} first {{announced}} by Winfried Fechner in March 2010 as Symphonic Odysseys - Uematsu in Concert, with the subtitle later changed to [...] "Tribute to Nobuo Uematsu". The sole composer {{featured in the}} concert is Nobuo Uematsu, a Japanese video game composer {{best known for his}} work at Square Enix, who {{is considered one of the}} most famous and respected composers in the video game community. He has composed the music for dozens of video games, including the majority of the Final Fantasy series, and his compositions had been a significant component of the Symphonic Fantasies concert. Böcker has said that he considers Uematsu to be [...] "the most famous composer of video game music and in general one of the most influential", and that Uematsu's 20020220 - Music from Final Fantasy concert in 2002 was a big influence on his own concerts. The decision to focus the event on Uematsu was made in part due to Uematsu's own desire to one day hear a concert based on his compositions as a whole; he was also very interested in <b>hearing</b> <b>more</b> experimental arrangements of his pieces than have been done in the past after watching the Symphonic Fantasies concert. A website was set up for news and updates on the concert, including video messages from Nobuo Uematsu himself. Tickets for the concert went on sale on December 1, 2010, and were sold out within 12 hours, prompting the addition of a second performance to be held earlier in the afternoon of the same day. This too sold out, resulting in a total attendance of over 4000. A third performance will be held almost six years later on June 18, 2017 in Paris, and a fourth a year later on June 20, 2017 in London, both by the London Symphony Orchestra.|$|E

2500|$|Agnosia is the {{inability}} to process sensory information. Often there is a loss of ability to recognize objects, persons, sounds, shapes, or smells while the specific sense is not defective {{nor is there any}} significant memory loss. It is usually associated with brain injury or neurological illness, particularly after damage to the occipitotemporal border, {{which is part of the}} ventral stream. [...] Agnosia only affects a single modality, such as vision or <b>hearing.</b> <b>More</b> recently, a top-down interruption is considered to cause the disturbance of handling perceptual information.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few years}} later, the Supreme Court began <b>hearing</b> <b>more</b> {{arbitration}} cases, and expanding {{the scope and}} reach of the process in its decisions. Writing for a 1983 majority in Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp., William Brennan held that the FAA enacted [...] "a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary". One of his dicta in that case, that the FAA applies to contracts under state law as well, became the central holding of Southland Corp. v. Keating the following year.|$|E
2500|$|Thompson {{has been}} well served by compilers of {{retrospective}} collections. [...] These are partly aimed at curious new listeners {{who are interested in}} <b>hearing</b> <b>more</b> of him, but are also essential purchases for more committed fans, since they contain material which is unavailable elsewhere. [...] 1976's (guitar, vocal) was a collection of unreleased material from the previous eight years of Thompson's appearances on the Island label. [...] The 3-CD set Watching the Dark is a generous combination of his better-known songs and previously unreleased live and studio tracks. [...] Action Packed is a compilation of tracks from his Capitol releases, plus three hard-to-find songs. [...] Finally, in 2006, the independent label Free Reed released , a 5-CD box set consisting almost entirely of previously unreleased performances of songs from throughout Thompson's long career.|$|E

Although the {{claimant}} complains {{of the lack}} of opportunity to cross-examine the reporting physicians, he did not take advantage of the opportunity afforded him under 20 CFR 404.926 to request subpoenas for the physicians. The five-day period specified by the regulation for the issuance of the subpoenas surely afforded no real obstacle to this, for he was notified that the documentary evidence on file was available for examination before the hearing and, further, a supplemental [...] hearing could be requested. In fact, in this very case there was a supplemental <b>hearing</b> <b>more</b> than {{two and a half months}} after the initial hearings. This inaction on {{the claimant}}'s part supports the Court of Appeals' view [...] that the claimant as a consequence is to be precluded from now complaining that he was denied the rights of confrontation and cross-examination.|$|E
2500|$|News of the {{intended}} rebellion had reached London {{and the surrounding}} townships by December 7. It was initially thought that the Toronto rebellion was successful, contributing to Charles Duncombe wanting to rise up as well. [...] Upon <b>hearing</b> <b>more</b> details about the rebellion in Toronto, Duncombe convened a series of public meetings to spread news of the supposed atrocities committed by Bond Head against all suspected reformers to help increase anti-government support. It is estimated that there were between 400-500 rebels who assembled under Duncombe [...] Colonel Allan MacNab, who had just finished leading Upper Canadian militiamen during the Battle of Montgomery's Tavern, was sent to engage Duncombe's uprising. He left Hamilton, Ontario on December 12 and arrived in Brantford on December 13. Although many rebels, including Duncombe, had fled prior to the upcoming battle due to hearing about the failure of Mackenzie in Toronto and general disorganization, there were still some present in Scotland, Ontario and MacNab commenced his attack on Scotland on December 14, causing the remaining rebels to flee {{after only a few}} shots were fired. [...] The victorious Tory supporters burned homes and farms of known rebels and suspected supporters. In the 1860s, some of the former rebels were compensated by the Canadian government for their lost property in the rebellion aftermath.|$|E
