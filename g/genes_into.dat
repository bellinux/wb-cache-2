5|$|Although wolf-dog {{hybridization}} in Europe {{has raised}} concern among conservation groups fearing for the gray wolf's purity, genetic tests show that introgression of dog <b>genes</b> <b>into</b> European gray wolf populations does {{not pose a}} significant threat. Also, as wolf and dog mating seasons do not fully coincide, the likelihood of wild wolves and dogs mating and producing surviving offspring is small.|$|E
5|$|Geneticists {{often use}} viruses as vectors to {{introduce}} <b>genes</b> <b>into</b> cells {{that they are}} studying. This is useful for making the cell produce a foreign substance, or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome. In similar fashion, virotherapy uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases, as they can specifically target cells and DNA. It shows promising use {{in the treatment of}} cancer and in gene therapy. Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time, and interest in this approach is increasing, because of the high level of antibiotic resistance now found in some pathogenic bacteria.|$|E
5|$|The first {{transgenic}} primate {{was produced}} in 2001, {{with the development of}} a method that could introduce new <b>genes</b> <b>into</b> a rhesus macaque. This transgenic technology is now being applied in the search for a treatment for the genetic disorder Huntington's disease. Notable studies on non-human primates {{have been part of the}} polio vaccine development, and development of Deep Brain Stimulation, and their current heaviest non-toxicological use occurs in the monkey AIDS model, SIV. In 2008 a proposal to ban all primates experiments in the EU has sparked a vigorous debate.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the English {{bacteriologist}} Frederick Twort discovered {{a group of}} viruses that infect bacteria, now called bacteriophages (or commonly phages), and the French-Canadian microbiologist Félix d'Herelle described viruses that, when added to bacteria on an agar plate, would produce areas of dead bacteria. He accurately diluted a suspension of these viruses and discovered that the highest dilutions (lowest virus concentrations), rather than killing all the bacteria, formed discrete areas of dead organisms. Counting these areas and multiplying by the dilution factor allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the original suspension. Phages were heralded as a potential treatment for diseases such as typhoid and cholera, but their promise was forgotten {{with the development of}} penicillin. The study of phages provided insights into the switching on and off of genes, and a useful mechanism for introducing foreign <b>genes</b> <b>into</b> bacteria.|$|E
5|$|The Mew Project {{was started}} by Ryô's father, Dr. Shirogane, five years before Tokyo Mew Mew is set. The manga never {{explains}} why the project was started or how they knew about Chimera Animas and the aliens, but Dr. Shirogane does mention that they must learn how to inject animal <b>genes</b> <b>into</b> human DNA in order to fight the aliens. In the anime adaptation, Dr. Shirogane discovered the fossilized remains of an ancient civilization called the Chimera during an archaeological dig and began researching the race of people who lived there with his assistant Keiichirô Akasaka. This would eventually become the Mew Project. A laboratory explosion and a fire that kills Dr. Shirogane and his wife, leaving then 10-year-old Ryô orphaned. He moved back to Japan, with Keiichirô, to continue the Mew Project. According to the anime, the lab explosion {{was caused by a}} Chimera fossil that woke up setting the house on fire.|$|E
25|$|Since some {{viruses that}} infect eukaryotes need to {{transport}} their genetic material into the host cell's nucleus, they are attractive tools for introducing new <b>genes</b> <b>into</b> the host (known as transformation or transfection).

25|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated {{transformation}} is another common technique. Agrobacteria are natural plant parasites, and their natural ability to transfer genes provides another engineering method. To create a suitable environment for themselves, these Agrobacteria insert their <b>genes</b> <b>into</b> plant hosts, {{resulting in a}} proliferation of modified plant cells near the soil level (crown gall). The genetic information for tumor growth is encoded on a mobile, circular DNA fragment (plasmid). When Agrobacterium infects a plant, it transfers this T-DNA to a random site in the plant genome. When used in genetic engineering the bacterial T-DNA {{is removed from the}} bacterial plasmid and replaced with the desired foreign gene. The bacterium is a vector, enabling transportation of foreign <b>genes</b> <b>into</b> plants. This method works especially well for dicotyledonous plants like potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco. Agrobacteria infection is less successful in crops like wheat and maize.|$|E

For the long expression of target gene product, we tried to integrate the dystrophin <b>gene</b> <b>into</b> chromosome by using the sleeping beauty-transposone system and HDAdv.

25|$|Immunoliposomes are antibody-conjugated liposomes. Liposomes {{can carry}} drugs or {{therapeutic}} nucleotides and when conjugated with monoclonal antibodies, may be directed against malignant cells. Immunoliposomes {{have been successfully}} used in vivo to convey tumour-suppressing <b>genes</b> <b>into</b> tumours, using an antibody fragment against the human transferrin receptor. Tissue-specific gene delivery using immunoliposomes has been achieved in brain and breast cancer tissue.|$|E
25|$|Simulation of HGT {{events can}} also be {{performed}} by manipulating the biological sequences themselves.

25|$|Introducing new <b>genes</b> <b>into</b> plants {{requires}} a promoter {{specific to the}} area where the gene is to be expressed.

25|$|Transgene use {{in humans}} is {{currently}} fraught with issues. Transformation of <b>genes</b> <b>into</b> human cells {{has not been}} perfected yet. The most famous example of this involved certain patients developing T-cell leukemia after being treated for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID). This was attributed to the close proximity of the inserted gene to the LMO2 promoter, which controls the transcription of the LMO2 proto-oncogene.|$|E
25|$|It is now {{relatively}} simple to generate transgenic flies in Drosophila, {{relying on a}} variety of techniques. One approach of inserting foreign <b>genes</b> <b>into</b> the Drosophila genome involves P elements. The transposable P elements, also known as transposons, are segments of bacterial DNA that are transferred into the fly genome. Transgenic flies have already contributed to many scientific advances, e.g., modeling such human diseases as Parkinson's, neoplasia, obesity, and diabetes.|$|E

40|$|The {{selective}} {{alteration of}} the cellular genome by laser microbeam irradiation {{has been extensively}} applied in cell biology. We report here {{the use of the}} third harmonic (355 nm) of an yttrium-aluminum garnet laser to facilitate the direct transfer of the neo <b>gene</b> <b>into</b> cultured human HT 1080 - 6 TG cells. The resultant transformants were selected in medium containing an aminoglycoside antibiotic, G 418. Integration of the neo <b>gene</b> <b>into</b> individual human chromosomes and expression of the gene were demonstrated by Southern blot analyses, microcell-mediated chromosome transfer, and chromosome analyses. The stability of the integrated neo gene in the transformants was shown by a comparative growth assay in selective and nonselective media. Transformation and incorporation of the neo <b>gene</b> <b>into</b> the host genome occurred at a frequency of 8 X 10 (- 4) - 3 X 10 (- 3).

40|$|The {{virtually}} complete {{deficiency of}} the purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) {{results in a}} devastating neurological disease, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Transfer of the HPRT <b>gene</b> <b>into</b> fibroblasts and lymphoblasts in vitro and into hematopoietic cells in vivo has been accomplished by other groups with retroviral-derived vectors. It appears to be necessary, however, to transfer the HPRT <b>gene</b> <b>into</b> neuronal cells to correct the neurological dysfunction of this disorder. The neurotropic virus herpes simplex virus type 1 has features that make it suitable {{for use as a}} vector to transfer the HPRT <b>gene</b> <b>into</b> neuronal tissue.

25|$|In 2006 and 2007 it was {{reported}} that introducing a small number of specific transcription factor <b>genes</b> <b>into</b> normal skin cells of mice or humans can turn these cells into pluripotent stem cells, known as induced pluripotent stem cells.

25|$|Generally, efforts {{focused on}} {{administering}} {{a gene that}} causes a needed protein to be expressed.
