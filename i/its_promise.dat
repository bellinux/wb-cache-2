5|$|In October 1980, he {{interacted with}} a {{delegation}} of Solidarity members that included Lech Wałęsa, future President of the Third Republic of Poland. When Wałęsa complained that the Polish government was not keeping to <b>its</b> <b>promise</b> of allowing the independent labour movement enough of an opportunity to publicize itself, Jagielski indicated that {{he would try to}} give the movement better access to the Polish press, and to the Polish radio network. Jagielski led a delegation that went to a meeting in Moscow of Comecon, the Eastern Bloc economic community, during January 1981. That month, the government declared that the poor economy was forcing it to cut back on <b>its</b> <b>promise</b> of ensuring that Polish workers did not have to work on Saturdays, and that it would offer a number of Saturdays as work-free instead.|$|E
5|$|Maroon: The university's {{official}} color {{used to be}} magenta, {{one which}} was shared by Harvard University. Since it was confusing for the two schools to be wearing the same color during athletic competitions, the matter of which school could lay claim to magenta was to be settled {{through a series of}} baseball games. Fordham won the games, but Harvard reneged on <b>its</b> <b>promise.</b> Both schools continued to use the color until 1874, when the Fordham student government unanimously agreed to change to maroon. Maroon was chosen because it was not widely used at the time. Sometime later, Harvard stopped using magenta in favor of crimson.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the United States Soccer Federation {{fulfilled}} <b>its</b> <b>promise</b> to FIFA by aiding in {{the foundation}} of a new professional league. On June 15, 1994, Major League Soccer selected Washington, D.C. out of twenty-two applicants to host one of the first seven teams, with three more added before the league's launch. The team's name was chosen as a reflection of the names of European clubs, such as Manchester United or Leeds United.|$|E

5|$|The society's {{offer was}} the only one to include an {{existing}} building on its grounds. The Board of Regents accepted the society's offer, and a formal transfer of the Romney Classical Institute's former campus was made. The society discovered that, in order to make good on <b>its</b> <b>promise,</b> it had to raise more than $1,000, a close to impossible task during the Reconstruction Era in Romney. Following a resolution on July 11, 1870, to raise between $1,200 and $1,300, a subscription of $1,383.60 was raised after 118 individuals and firms donated the needed funds, and shortly thereafter the formal transfer of the property was completed. At that time, the institute's property was valued at about $20,000.|$|E
5|$|Livingstone's {{administration}} {{founded the}} Greater London Enterprise Board (GLEB) to create employment {{by investing in}} the industrial regeneration of London, with the funds provided by the council, its workers' pension fund and the financial markets. Livingstone later claimed that GLC bureaucrats obstructed much of what GLEB tried to achieve. Other policies implemented by the Labour Left also foundered. Attempts to prevent the sale-off of GLC council housing largely failed, {{in part due to}} the strong opposition from the Conservative government. ILEA attempted to carry through with <b>its</b> <b>promise</b> to cut the price of school meals in the capital from 35p to 25p, but was forced to abandon its plans following legal advice that the councillors could be made to pay the surcharge and disqualified from public office.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of China's socialist economy was <b>its</b> <b>promise</b> of employment to all able and willing to work and job-security with virtually lifelong tenure. Reformers targeted the labor market as unproductive because industries were frequently overstaffed to fulfill socialist goals and job-security reduced workers' incentive to work. This socialist policy was pejoratively called the iron rice bowl.|$|E

25|$|After the war, the British {{government}} {{transported to}} New Brunswick and settled about 400 of 3000 former slaves from the United States whom they freed {{during and after}} the war.

25|$|Tupper's {{position}} on the Manitoba Schools Act was that French Catholics in Manitoba had been promised the right to separate state-funded French-language Catholic schools in the Manitoba Act of 1870.

He maintained this position even after the Manitoba Schools Act was upheld by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the valley}} was within Yosemite National Park, {{an act of}} Congress was needed to authorize the project.
