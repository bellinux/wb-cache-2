50|$|The company {{first began}} keeping records of their calls in 1946. During that year they {{recorded}} “11” <b>fire</b> <b>calls.</b> If a call {{went out the}} Partlow’s would close the store, the Fletchers’ would stop milking cows, others would stop bailing hay, it didn’t matter what they were doing, members would stop whatever is was and go to help their neighbor. Not only did they run <b>fire</b> <b>calls</b> they also ran other types of calls, such as pumping water from cellars, pumping water from drains, rescuing farm animals, etc. During one call they used a piece of fire hose to rescue a horse from a well. Up until 1989 the members kept a running log of the yearly <b>fire</b> <b>calls</b> by writing the numbers on a chalkboard which was located in the old bays at the fire house. By 1988 the call volume had gone from 11 <b>fire</b> <b>calls</b> a year to 605 calls a year. Each year as the Ashburn area continued to grow the number of calls continued to increase. Today the Ashburn Volunteer Fire & Rescue Department runs over 4,500 <b>Fire</b> & EMS <b>calls</b> a year.|$|R

Though it only took fire crews about 10 minutes {{to put out the}} fire which broke out around 1:37 a.m., the odor of gas was the greater concern.|$|E
5000|$|The {{response}} of the department store was poor. Telephone Operator E received the <b>fire</b> <b>call</b> from A and B, and forwarded the call to Chief F; who said he dialed 119 {{but it did not}} go to the fire station. The inside broadcasting system required the permission of a superior who could not be reached. Operator E could view what was happening but escaped on the elevator with other employees.|$|E
50|$|The bikes {{will be sent}} to fires {{instead of}} fire {{appliances}} when fires are not deemed a threat to people or buildings, thereby freeing up appliances for use elsewhere. The equipment on one bike can fight a fire for two to three minutes, but can extinguish a car fire in around 20 seconds. The bikes {{will be sent to}} incidents of anti-social rubbish fires in skips or wheelie bins, which account for 60% of the force's <b>fire</b> <b>call</b> outs.|$|E
50|$|There are {{altogether}} 81 fire stations, 37 ambulance depots and six fireboat stations. They are strategically located {{to provide}} an emergency response for all areas. The graded response times for building <b>fire</b> <b>calls</b> are six minutes for built-up areas and nine to 23 minutes for areas of dispersed risks and isolated developments. For emergency ambulance services, the target response time is 12 minutes. The performance target is to achieve these response times in 92.5% of all calls. In 2004, 94.06% of building <b>fire</b> <b>calls</b> and 91.08% of emergency ambulance calls were responded to within the respective target response times.|$|R

5000|$|Each zone of {{the grid}} is {{identified}} with a progression of ambulance zones and fire stations. One zone might be labeled: DP241. This means fire station 2, then 4, then 1, then 3 would respond to a <b>fire</b> <b>call</b> occurring inside this zone. If fire stations 2, 4, and 1 were assigned to calls, Station 3 {{would be sent to}} this zone. Distal Volunteer Rescue Squad would be first-up for an ambulance call occurring inside zone DP241.|$|E
50|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the park is a statue of three life-sized firefighters engaged in a rescue situation. One firefighter is dragging a disabled firefighter with another nearby ready to help.

50|$|SiraTone is a {{brand of}} {{electronic}} outdoor warning sirens produced by Federal Signal Corporation which began production in 1981. These sirens were designed to broadcast high-intensity warning signals over a large area. SiraTone products are/were used for natural disaster notification, HAZMAT incident notification, <b>fire</b> <b>call</b> systems, and more. Most of the SiraTone line was discontinued in the mid-to-late 1990s and newer designs, like the Modulator and DSA (Directional Speaker Array), have replaced it. The SiraTone product line is not in standard production, as of 1995.|$|E
5000|$|In 1953, Pittsfield, Massachusetts firefighters William J. Knight and Walter J. Pictrowski {{designed}} and built a three-wheeled version of Smokey Stover's Foo Mobile. With permission and suggestions from Holman, the vehicle was adorned with familiar paraphernalia, such as a rubber-handled ax, a <b>fire</b> <b>call</b> box, a fire gong, crank handle and steam-generating radiator cap (a fire nozzle with the slogan [...] "Sea-Oh-Too!"). The Foo Car has {{been in and out}} of service over the years and has been restored twice, brought back for appearances at Berkshire area parades, musters and charity events. It is currently garaged.|$|E
5000|$|The {{disaster}} {{generated a}} fair amount of scholarly debate. Historian Arthur Thurner's Rebels on the Range: The Michigan Copper Miners' Strike of 1913-1914 raises the possibility that there actually might have been a fire {{in another part of the}} hall, perhaps in the chimney of the building. Perhaps the strongest argument against an actual fire is that none of the investigations found any witnesses who would claim there was a fire. The fire log of the Red Jacket Fire Department (the local fire department that responded to the <b>fire</b> <b>call)</b> also specifically states [...] "no fire".|$|E
