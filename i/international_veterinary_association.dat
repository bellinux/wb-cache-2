While lack of favorable evidence can result from lack of long-term studies investigating the effect of eating a balanced raw diet, a minority of holistic-oriented veterinarians recommend raw feeding because of clear health benefits they observed over the years in raw fed dogs. Dr Tom Lonsdale in Australia has been a long-time and prominent veterinary advocate of raw feeding.|$|R
50|$|A {{preceding}} organisation {{started out}} as the National <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Association</b> in 1882 after the first ever British National Veterinary Congress in July 1881. A vet, George Banham, had suggested {{the idea of a}} national <b>veterinary</b> <b>association.</b> George Fleming, the principal vet to the Armed Forces, was the first elected President. The Association was open to any vet, no matter which country they were from, on the payment of half a guinea. Other previous <b>veterinary</b> <b>associations</b> still co-existed though. It had an informal organisation and meetings across the country were arranged on an ad hoc basis. This style of organisation did not suit many vets, who wanted an organisation where they could discuss matters which did not or could not be discussed by the RCVS. In 1909 {{at a meeting of the}} Scottish Metropolitan <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Association,</b> Professor Orlando Charnock Bradley of the Edinburgh Veterinary College, called for a 'one single British veterinary association'. The idea was generally accepted, but the First World War stopped anything from happening.|$|R
