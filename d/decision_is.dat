In such situations, intervention by the High Court is warranted as the action or <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> factually unsustainable.|$|E

50|$|In Australia, intermediate-level courts {{tend to have}} a heavy case load, and so many <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> {{delivered}} ex tempore {{for reasons}} of time and necessity. Because many <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> ex tempore, intermediate-level courts' <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> not binding on inferior courts - that is to say, that in New South Wales, the District Court's <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> not binding on the Local Court (see Valentine v Eid (1992) 27 NSWLR 615 and stare decisis).|$|R

5|$|The Court also {{rejected}} {{the proposition that}} the principle of proportionality be recognized as a separate ground for judicial review. Rather, it should be subsumed under irrationality, in the sense that if an executive <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> disproportionate it can be said to be irrational in that no reasonable authority could have come to such a decision.|$|E
5|$|After {{inviting}} {{reporters in}} mid-April, Samsung launched the Galaxy SIII during the Samsung Mobile Unpacked 2012 event at Earls Court Exhibition Centre, London, United Kingdom, on 3 May 2012, instead of unveiling their products {{earlier in the}} year during either the World Mobile Congress or Consumer Electronics Show (CES). One explanation for this <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> that Samsung wanted to minimize the time between its launch and availability. The keynote address of the hour-long event was delivered by Loesje De Vriese, Marketing Director of Samsung Belgium.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sections}} 8 and 10 of the ISA concern {{matters of}} national security, the Court held that this concern {{does not preclude}} the objective review of executive discretion. Following the case of Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1983), the Court of Appeal decided that {{it is up to}} the courts to determine whether a <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> in fact based on grounds of national security. Similarly, it should also be within the court's purview to determine whether the matters relied upon in exercising powers under the ISA fall within the scope of purposes specified by sections8 and 10.|$|E

5|$|Cupid conceals himself, as Theseus and Ariadne {{arrive on}} the island a short {{distance}} away. Ariadne muses over her disloyalty to her father, but declares her love for Theseus. She departs to find shelter for the night, after which a fishermen's chorus compares her eyes with the stars of heaven. Theseus, alone with his counsellor, discusses his abandonment of Ariadne, and is advised that this <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> justified, as {{she will not be}} acceptable to the people of Athens as their ruler's consort.|$|E
5|$|However, the Attorney-General may not {{consent to}} lend {{his name to}} a relator action. This matter lies entirely within his discretion, and his <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> not {{considered}} reviewable by the courts. In addition, it has been forcefully argued that since the Attorney-General is the principal legal advisor of the executive, it is overly idealistic to expect his consent to an action against the Government. This makes a relator action an uncertain, and hence an unsatisfactory, means of obtaining relief.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Appeal held {{further that}} as the {{discretion}} conferred by section 8 of the ISA involved national security, {{the issue of whether}} detention was necessary should be left solely to executive discretion. However, the Court referred to two United Kingdom decisions which stood for the principle that courts are not precluded from determining whether a <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> in fact based on grounds of national security. Therefore, the court could still determine whether the matters relied on by the executive in the exercise of discretion were indeed within the scope of section 8.|$|E

Why Hanley corporation made such a <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> not recorded, but it {{was reported in the}} Staffordshire Sentinel of 5 February 1901 that it was because Stoke Corporation insisted that the administrative centre of the new county be in Stoke, not Hanley, and this was something that Hanley could not agree too.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of types of {{legislation}} which can be passed. The strongest is a regulation, an act or law which is directly applicable in its entirety.
