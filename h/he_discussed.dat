5|$|At {{one point}} in the poem, Eliot used terza rima rhyme {{in a manner similar to}} Dante. In a 1950 lecture, <b>he</b> <b>discussed</b> how he imitated Dante within Little Gidding and the {{challenges}} that this presented. The lecture also dwelt on keeping to a set form and how Dante's poetry is the model for religious poetry and poetry in general. Besides Dante, many of the images used in Little Gidding were allusions to Eliot's earlier poems, especially the other poems of the Four Quartets.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's qualities as {{a pianist}} and {{composer}} were recognized {{by many of}} his fellow musicians. Schumann named a piece for him in his suite Carnaval, and Chopin later dedicated his Ballade No. 2 in F major to Schumann. Elements of Chopin's music can be traced in many of Liszt's later works. Liszt later transcribed for piano six of Chopin's Polish songs.

During the blockade of El Callao, he proposed that O'Higgins {{take control of the}} mission and send any spoils of battle to Chile. As San Martín was appointed Protector of Peru, Cochrane reasoned that San Martín was no longer under Chilean command, and took the navy away. In later years Cochrane made accusations against San Martín in Chile.|$|E

5000|$|One {{reviewer}} of the DVD set commented: [...] "Diarmaid {{is certainly}} well-educated, and {{his knowledge of}} Christian history seems to be quite vast. And while he has his book knowledge, {{he seems to be}} genuinely excited about the subject <b>he's</b> <b>discussing.</b> <b>He</b> presents the first years of Christianity in a factual way, in a manner that's enthusiastic but doesn't belie his own personal beliefs. For all we know Diarmid could be a Buddhist, such is his presentation of the facts. He seems excited, but not showing a certain bias either way" ...|$|R

5|$|Writer Robert L. Forward {{described}} being {{inspired by}} astronomer Frank Drake's suggestion in 1973 that intelligent life could inhabit neutron stars. Physical models in 1973 implied that Drake's creatures would be microscopic.

Later Forward found an earlier letter in which <b>he</b> <b>discussed</b> the idea of high-gravity life in the Sun with science fiction novelist Hal Clement.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} historians {{began in the}} early twentieth century to {{question}} if the Imprimerie nationale Latin-alphabet type was really the work of Garamond, as the Grecs du Roi undoubtedly were. Doubt was raised by French historian Jean Paillard, but he died in the First World War soon after publishing his conclusions in 1914 and his work remained little-read. ATF's historian Henry Lewis Bullen secretly doubted that the 'Garamond' his company was reviving was really Garamond's work, noting that he had never seen it in a sixteenth-century book. <b>He</b> <b>discussed</b> his concerns with ATF junior librarian Beatrice Warde, who would later move to Europe and become a prominent writer on printing advising the British branch of Monotype.|$|E

5|$|After {{conferring with}} the chief {{engineers}} of the Second and Third field armies, Shazly became aware that IAF, despite heavy losses, had destroyed so many bridge sections that the Egyptians had lost the equivalent of three heavy bridges, leaving four bridges in reserve along with the five already laid in the canal. This gave rise to concerns about supply {{in the coming days}} and weeks. Shazly then discussed the possibility of constructing three bridges in the canal using earth and sand. This would make causeways impregnable against air strikes and artillery. The chief engineer of the Third Army, with whom <b>he</b> <b>discussed</b> the idea, was confidant that, given enough bulldozers, the causeways could be constructed in one week.|$|E
5|$|As Nixon {{prepared}} for the August 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, <b>he</b> <b>discussed</b> possible running mates with his staff. Among these were Ronald Reagan, the conservative Governor of California, and the more liberal Mayor of New York City, John Lindsay. Nixon felt that these high-profile names could split the party, and looked for a less divisive figure. He did not indicate a preferred choice, and Agnew's name was not raised at this stage. Agnew was intending {{to go to the}} convention with his Maryland delegation as a favorite son, uncommitted to any of the main candidates.|$|E

Afterwards he took contact with County Governor Olav Oksvik and the two started working towards implementing the plans.|$|E
