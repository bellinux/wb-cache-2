5|$|Draft is {{the amount}} of slope or taper given to cores or other parts of the <b>die</b> <b>cavity</b> to allow for easy {{ejection}} of the casting from the die. All die cast surfaces that are parallel to the opening direction of the die require draft for the proper ejection of the casting from the die. Die castings that feature proper draft are easier to remove from the die and result in high-quality surfaces and more precise finished product.|$|E
500|$|Other die {{components}} include cores and slides. Cores are {{components that}} usually produce holes or opening, {{but they can}} be used to create other details as well. There are three types of cores: fixed, movable, and loose. Fixed cores are ones that are oriented parallel to the pull direction of the dies (i.e. the direction the dies open), therefore they are fixed, or permanently attached to the die. Movable cores are ones that are oriented in any other way than parallel to the pull direction. These cores must be removed from the <b>die</b> <b>cavity</b> after the shot solidifies, but before the dies open, using a separate mechanism. Slides are similar to movable cores, except they are used to form undercut surfaces. The use of movable cores and slides greatly increases the cost of the dies. Loose cores, also called pick-outs, are used to cast intricate features, such as threaded holes. These loose cores are inserted into the die by hand before each cycle and then ejected with the part {{at the end of the}} cycle. The core then must be removed by hand. Loose cores are the most expensive type of core, because of the extra labor and increased cycle time. Other features in the dies include water-cooling passages and vents along the parting lines. These vents are usually wide and thin (approximately [...] ) so that when the molten metal starts filling them the metal quickly solidifies and minimizes scrap. No risers are used because the high pressure ensures a continuous feed of metal from the gate.|$|E
2500|$|Impression-die forging is {{also called}} [...] "closed-die forging". In impression-die forging, the metal {{is placed in}} a die {{resembling}} a mold, which is attached to an anvil. Usually, the hammer die is shaped as well. The hammer is then dropped on the workpiece, causing the metal to flow and fill the die cavities. The hammer is generally {{in contact with the}} workpiece on the scale of milliseconds. Depending on the size and complexity of the part, the hammer may be dropped multiple times in quick succession. Excess metal is squeezed out of the die cavities, forming what is referred to as [...] "flash". The flash cools more rapidly {{than the rest of the}} material; this cool metal is stronger than the metal in the die, so it helps prevent more flash from forming.

2500|$|One {{variation}} of impression-die forging is called [...] "flashless forging", or [...] "true closed-die forging". In {{this type of}} forging, the <b>die</b> <b>cavities</b> are completely closed, which keeps the workpiece from forming flash. The major advantage to this process is that less metal is lost to flash. Flash can account for 20 to 45% of the starting material. The disadvantages of this process include additional cost due to a more complex die design {{and the need for}} better lubrication and workpiece placement.|$|R
25|$|Closed-die forging {{has a high}} {{initial cost}} due to the {{creation}} of dies and required design work to make working <b>die</b> <b>cavities.</b> However, it has low recurring costs for each part, thus forgings become more economical with more volume. This {{is one of the major}} reasons closed-die forgings are often used in the automotive and tool industries. Another reason forgings are common in these industrial sectors is that forgings generally have about a 20 percent higher strength-to-weight ratio compared to cast or machined parts of the same material.|$|R

50|$|It is {{also known}} as {{impression}} die forging. Impressions are made in a pair of dies. These impressions are transferred to the work piece during deformation. A small gap between the dies called flash gutter is provided so that the excess metal can flow into the gutter and form a flash. Flash has got a very important role during deformation of the work piece inside the <b>die</b> <b>cavity.</b> Due to high length to thickness ratio of the flash gutter, friction in the gap is very high. Due to this the material in the flash gap is subjected to high pressure. There is high resistance to flow. This in turn promotes effective filling of the <b>die</b> <b>cavity.</b> In hot forging, the flash cools faster as a result of it being smaller in size. This enhances the resistance of the flash material to deformation resistance. As a result of this, the bulk of work piece is forced to deform and fill the <b>die</b> <b>cavity</b> more effectively - even intricate parts of the <b>die</b> <b>cavity</b> is filled.|$|E
50|$|In {{the deep}} drawing process, a blank of sheet metal (usually circular) {{is placed on}} the die. The die is fixed to the base. The metal blank is held in {{position}} on the die using blank holder. Mechanical force is applied {{on the part of the}} metal blank above the <b>die</b> <b>cavity</b> through a punch. As the punch force increases the metal flows from the flange region in to the <b>die</b> <b>cavity.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{workpiece}} {{is placed}} into the forge. Then {{the impact of}} a hammer causes the heated material, which is very malleable, to conform to the shape of the <b>die</b> and <b>die</b> <b>cavities.</b> Typically only one die is needed to completely form the part. Extra space between the die faces causes some of the material to be pressed out of the sides, forming flash. This acts as a relief valve for the extreme pressure produced by the closing of the die halves and is later trimmed off of the finished part.|$|R
40|$|Mould filling {{simulation}} in {{high pressure}} die casting has been an attractive area of research for many years. Several numerical methodologies have been attempted {{in the past to}} study the flow behaviour of the molten metal into the <b>die</b> <b>cavities.</b> However, many of these methods require a stationary mesh or grid which limits their ability in simulating highly dynamic and transient flows encountered in high {{pressure die casting}} processes. In recent years, the advent of meshfree methods have expanded the capabilities of numerical techniques.

50|$|After {{getting through}} these challenges, the real {{benefits}} of this processes were discovered. Squeeze casting allows for the addition of an insulating layer around the metal core. This results in a layer that prevents the <b>die</b> <b>cavity's</b> heat from melting the core that is being produced. With the insulating layer intact, the construction of this core allows it to be more easily extracted all while leaving behind the protective-insulating layer. Moreover, through this process, a low cost option of producing squeeze cores that is able to withstand high pressures has been made open to the public.|$|R

Thus, the pressure of the liquid increases as the die closes.

The first environment is the primary source of data (die temperatures) used to refine numerical model and forging simulations. The second one, after the refinement, should predict with reasonable accuracy thermal and mechanical cycles to be considered in the third environment.

Another variation follows the same process as outlined above, except the preform is produced by the spraying deposition of metal droplets into shaped collectors (similar to the Osprey process).Closed-die forging has a high initial cost due to the creation of dies and required design work to make working die cavities.
