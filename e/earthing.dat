25|$|In {{electricity}} supply systems, an <b>earthing</b> (grounding) system defines the electrical {{potential of the}} conductors relative {{to that of the}} Earth's conductive surface. The choice of <b>earthing</b> system has implications for the safety and electromagnetic compatibility of the power supply. Regulations for <b>earthing</b> systems vary considerably between different countries.|$|E
25|$|Some {{of these}} sockets {{have one or}} more earth holes to allow 3-pin plugs. On {{properly}} wired circuits, the earth contact will be connected to earth. However, they cannot provide <b>earthing</b> to all types of plugs, {{as is the case}} of Schuko (which requires recessed sockets containing side <b>earthing</b> contacts) and French plugs (which require an <b>earthing</b> pin projecting from the socket).|$|E
25|$|Bonding and <b>earthing</b> are {{the usual}} ways by which charge buildup can be prevented. For fluids with {{electrical}} conductivity below 10 pS/m, bonding and <b>earthing</b> are not adequate for charge dissipation, and anti-static additives may be required.|$|E

25|$|It has <b>earthing</b> clips on {{both sides}} {{to connect with the}} CEE7/3 socket and a female contact to accept the <b>earthing</b> pin of the CEE7/5 socket. Currently, {{appliances}} in many countries are sold with non-rewireable CEE7/7 plugs attached, enabling use in all countries whose socket standards are based on either CEE7/3 or CEE7/5.|$|E
25|$|This Danish {{standard}} plug {{is described}} in the Danish Plug Equipment Section 107-2-D1 Standard sheet (SRAF1962/DB 16/87 DN10A-R). Unlike the French CEE7/6 plug, the <b>earthing</b> pin is on the plug, not in the socket. The Danish socket need not be recessed to protect the <b>earthing</b> pin. The Danish standard provides for sockets to have child-resistant shutters.|$|E
25|$|CEE7/2 and 7/4 plugs are not {{compatible}} with the CEE7/5 socket because of the round <b>earthing</b> pin permanently mounted in the socket.|$|E
5000|$|As I Ching and Feng Shui described, <b>Earth</b> {{generally}} {{contains all}} elements including Fire, Water, Wood and Metal.

25|$|The {{commonly}} used altitude classifications of geocentric orbit are Low <b>Earth</b> orbit (LEO), Medium <b>Earth</b> orbit (MEO) and High <b>Earth</b> orbit (HEO).

5000|$|A Resident Space Object (RSO) is {{a natural}} or {{artificial}} object that orbits another body e.g. Sun Orbiting, <b>Earth</b> Orbiting, Mars Orbiting etc. It is most often used to reference objects that are <b>Earth</b> orbiting.

5000|$|Wild <b>Earth</b> {{came about}} when the {{original}} <b>Earth</b> First!: The Radical Environmental Journal ceased publication in late 1990. The founders were Dave Foreman and John Davis. That publication {{was associated with the}} environmental group <b>Earth</b> First!. In 1990, following increasingly acrimonious debate over the direction of <b>Earth</b> First!, the organization split and the original Journal folded. Those who wished to continue activism under the <b>Earth</b> First! name, including anarchists and a west coast faction led by Judi Bari and Mike Roselle, launched a new <b>Earth</b> First! Journal. Much of the [...] "old guard" [...] who founded <b>Earth</b> First! in 1980 did not wish to continue under the <b>Earth</b> First! name and launched the magazine, Wild <b>Earth.</b> Wild <b>Earth</b> differed strongly from the <b>Earth</b> First! Journal in that while the latter emphasized direct action and a style rooted in the counterculture, Wild <b>Earth</b> emphasized conservation biology, science, and wilderness proposals, and a style rooted in the conservationism movement. Wild <b>Earth</b> was published quarterly.|$|R
25|$|The {{vehicle is}} {{connected}} to the power grid through standard socket-outlets present in residences, which depending on the country are usually rated at around 10 A. To use mode 1, the electrical installation must comply with the safety regulations and must have an <b>earthing</b> system, a circuit breaker to protect against overload and an earth leakage protection. The sockets have blanking devices to prevent accidental contacts.|$|E
25|$|Strictly speaking, {{the terms}} {{grounding}} or <b>earthing</b> {{are meant to}} refer to an electrical connection to ground/earth. Bonding is the practice of intentionally electrically connecting metallic items not designed to carry electricity. This brings all the bonded items to the same electrical potential as a protection from electrical shock. The bonded items can then be connected to ground {{to bring them to}} earth potential.|$|E
25|$|A second, {{quite common}} type {{looks like a}} Schuko socket, but adds a central <b>earthing</b> hole. This design can accept CEE7/4 (German), CEE7/7 (German/French), and Italian 10A plugs. Some of these sockets may also have figure-8 shaped holes to accept Italian 16A plugs as well. Its {{drawback}} {{is that it is}} twice as large as a normal Italian socket and the price is higher; for those reasons Schuko and bipasso-Schuko socket have been rarely installed in Italy until recent times.|$|E

25|$|Every {{region has}} {{regulations}} on electronic equipment. Bands {{that are on}} tour with electronic drums will need to do maintenance and periodic tests of the equipment. As well, bands that are crossing international borders may need accurate paperwork for their electronic drums.

Occasionally a venue may require a risk assessment before electronic drums {{can be used on}} stage.|$|E
25|$|Having one RCD feeding {{another is}} {{generally}} unnecessary, provided {{they have been}} wired properly. One exception {{is the case of}} a TT <b>earthing</b> system, where the earth loop impedance may be high, meaning that a ground fault might not cause sufficient current to trip an ordinary circuit breaker or fuse. In this case a special 100 mA (or greater) trip current time-delayed RCD is installed, covering the whole installation, and then more sensitive RCDs should be installed downstream of it for sockets and other circuits that are considered high-risk.|$|E
25|$|Plug and socket systems {{intended}} for high current, high voltage or polyphase industrial equipment, {{as well as}} additional contacts and larger contacts, may also include features to improve the security and safety of use. For example, a high-power plug may include a locking ring or twist-lock feature to prevent accidental disconnection in use. A socket may include a mechanical interlock that prevents insertion or removal of a plug unless the local safety disconnecting switch is open. Plugs may include special measures to contain an arc generated during disconnection. Plugs used for equipment in wet locations (such as mines) may include small supervisory contacts that check {{the integrity of the}} <b>earthing</b> conductor.|$|E
