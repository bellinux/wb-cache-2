50|$|The {{availability}} {{and cost of}} liquidity are two crucial issues for the smooth processing of payments in RTGS systems. In TARGET2, liquidity can be managed very flexibly and is available at low cost since fully remunerated minimum reserves - which credit institutions are required to hold with their central bank - {{can be used in}} full for settlement purposes during the day. The averaging provisions applied to minimum reserves allow banks to be flexible in their end-of-day liquidity management. The overnight lending and deposit facilities also allow for continuous liquidity management decisions. The Eurosystem provides intraday credit. This credit must be <b>fully</b> <b>collateralised</b> and no interest is charged. However, all Eurosystem credit must be <b>fully</b> <b>collateralised,</b> i.e. secured by other assets. The range of eligible collateral is very wide. Assets eligible for monetary policy purposes are also eligible for intraday credit. Under Eurosystem rules, credit can only be granted by the national central bank of the Member State where the participant is established. Banks’ treasury managers have a keen interest in the use of automated processes for the optimisation of payment and liquidity management. They need tools {{that will allow them to}} track activity across accounts and, where possible, make accurate intraday and overnight funding decisions from a single location - e.g. their head office.TARGET2 users have, via the Information and Control Module, access to comprehensive online information and easy-to-use liquidity management features that meet their business needs.|$|E
40|$|Debt {{with many}} {{creditors}} is analysed in a continuous-time pricing {{model of the}} levered firm. We specifically allow for debtor opportunism vis-à-vis a non-co-ordinated group of creditors, in form of repeated strategic renegotiation offers and default threats. We show that the creditors initial entitlement to non-collateralized assets will be expropriated through exchange offers. Exchange offers successively increase the level of collateral until all assets are <b>fully</b> <b>collateralised.</b> The ex ante optimal debt contract is neither <b>fully</b> <b>collateralised</b> nor without any collateral. Diffusely held debt allows for a larger debt capacity and bears lower credit risk premia than privately held debt. We derive simple closed-form solutions {{for the value of}} equity and defaultable bonds. Numerical estimates show that the bond valuation is very sensitive to the correct specification of the debt renegotiation model. ...|$|E

This study aims {{to make a}} {{contribution}} to the better understanding of the role commodities play in a portfolio, specifically in a South African investment portfolio. It considers the interactions between a <b>fully</b> <b>collateralised</b> commodity index and South African equities, bonds, property and cash. The study uses historical data to asses if commodities provide addition benefits to an investment portfolio, namely, additional returns, diversification and as an inflation hedge. The analyses used in this study are performance analysis, correlation studies and portfolio optimisation. Based on the evidence presented in this study we show that there were some benefits to adding commodities to a South African investment portfolio, namely, using commodities to diversify a portfolio and as an inflation hedge. However, commodities did not provide sufficiently large enough returns to justify their high volatility and as such would not be an appropriate stand alone investment in the South African context...|$|E
40|$|The {{resolution}} of the international debt crises has stimulated extensive research on how to design solutions for countries facing external debt overhang problems. This paper analyses the benefits for creditors and debtors of the following "market‐based" debt restructuring schemes: (i) issue of collateralised new assets {{in exchange for the}} old debt; (ii) automatic roll‐over of the debt repayment with a state‐contingent penalty rate. The first proposal combines the basic debt conversion scheme proposed by Krugman (1989) with Cline"s proposal (1995) of self‐enhancements on the new claims as a form of risk‐compensation for creditors (see also Williamson, 1988). Under this scheme the debtor country modifies the stream of the debt service payments by voluntarily exchanging the outstanding debt for new assets with different debt service characteristics where the principal and/or the interest rate payment can be <b>fully</b> or partially <b>collateralised.</b> The roll‐over scheme entitles illiquid countries to extend the outstanding debt for a specified period at a penalty rate which is contingent on a measure of the country"s creditworthiness. This solution has the desirable effect of reducing the future contractual obligations by lowering the penalty rate on the excess of debt rolled over, thus helping the debtor country to use additional resources to invest in the economy.

40|$|In {{the euro}} area, {{responsibility}} incumbent upon central banks {{in terms of}} financial stability is mainly exercised at the national level. Indeed, it would have only been justified to assign the European Central Bank (ECB) {{a key role in}} the maintenance of financial stability if the creation of the euro area was likely to increase systemic risk. In fact, the setting up of Target, with the granting of <b>fully</b> <b>collateralised</b> intraday credits in the real-time gross settlement systems operated by central banks, has led to a reduction in systemic risk. Furthermore, several factors, either of a macroeconomic nature (the single monetary policy, the disappearance of exchange-rate crises and improved fiscal discipline), or a technical nature (increased liquidity and the replacement of unsecured loans by repos) have come together to strengthen financial market stability. Lastly, in the banking sector, credit institutions have capitalised on several years of robust economic growth to increase their financial soundness. Banking mergers have generally taken place at the national level and cross-border lending has remained meagre, limiting risks of contagion in the euro area as a whole. In any case, the Eurosystem has ways of preventing and efficiently managing systemic crisis, should it arise. Target is protected against the risk of “seizing up” thanks to broad eligible collateral requirements, and against the risk of intraday credit payment default — notably by participants from “pre-in” countries — thanks to dissuasive measures. The Eurosystem constantly monitors financial markets and, as it demonstrated in the wake of the events of the September 2001, has efficient and rapid means of assuaging the market pressures that could be passed on to banking liquidity, the only type of liquidity the Eurosystem steers. In addition, as central banks pay heed to financial market distortions only because they may impair the stability of prices of goods and services and affect financial stability, it would be unwarranted for the ECB to take account of asset prices in its conduct of monetary policy. Lastly, close international co-operation between banking supervisors and the advantages inherent in combining monetary policymaking with banking supervision at the national level prove that the Eurosystem’s institutional supervisory arrangements, in which national central banks play a primary role, are appropriate. In this regard, the organisation of the provision of emergency liquidity to institutions has not changed fundamentally since the changeover to the euro, as mechanisms for the rapid transmission of information to the ECB make it possible to deal with the impact that these operations have in terms of liquidity. ...|$|E
