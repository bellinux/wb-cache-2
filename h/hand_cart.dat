25|$|Fecal sludge {{collection}} {{services can}} be made available on a scheduled basis or on a call-for-service basis (also known as on-demand, on-request or non-scheduled services). The collected fecal sludge may be transported to treatment plants by using a vacuum truck; a tank and pump mounted on a flatbed truck; a small tank pulled by a motorcycle; or in containers on a <b>hand</b> <b>cart.</b> Mobile or permanent transfer stations {{can be used to}} improve the efficiency of fecal sludge transportation by transferring the waste to larger tankers for haulage to treatment. The wider use of multiple decentralized sludge treatment facilities within the city (to avoid long haulage distances) is currently being researched and piloted.|$|E

He purchased the towel business and as his business grew, George turned for help to his younger brother whom he made an equal partner. Together they made deliveries from a green and white <b>hand</b> <b>cart</b> they pushed through the city streets. It wasn't long before the <b>hand</b> <b>cart</b> was upgraded to a horse-drawn wagon. George named his business Lincoln Towel and Apron Supply Company and later became known as American Linen.
