We investigate {{the source of this}} finding by focusing on the individual moments <b>of</b> the empirical <b>fund</b> <b>of</b> hedge <b>fund</b> return distribution.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{simultaneous}} management <b>of</b> hedge <b>funds</b> and <b>funds</b> <b>of</b> hedge <b>funds.</b> Hedge fund firms {{can choose to}} simultaneously offer a <b>fund</b> <b>of</b> hedge <b>funds.</b> Similarly, <b>fund</b> <b>of</b> hedge <b>fund</b> firms can simultaneously offer a hedge fund.

The effects <b>of</b> simultaneity are also different. When hedge <b>fund</b> firms start <b>funds</b> <b>of</b> hedge <b>funds,</b> we find evidence <b>of</b> value creation, driven by better management of economies of scale and cross learning.
