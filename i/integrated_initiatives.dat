It was subsequently launched in October 1997 at the WTO's High Level Meeting on <b>Integrated</b> <b>Initiatives</b> for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development, which {{was held at the}} WTO. It was meant as a mechanism to increase effectiveness and efficiency of trade-related technical assistance to LDCs by improving coordination between donors, beneficiary countries and providers of technical assistance. The calls for an overarching program arose from the feeling that the uncoordinated actions of these parties lead to duplication of efforts, overallocation of resources to certain technical and geographical areas, and an untapped potential for joint initiatives and information exchange.|$|E

40|$|Across Europe, area-based {{policies}} have been developed {{as a mode of}} urban governance to deal with the unfavourable situation in many urban neighbourhoods, particularly large post-Second World War developments. The philosophy behind these area-based policies is that <b>integrated</b> <b>initiatives</b> to deal with the physical, economic and social aspects of these urban neighbourhoods, will lead to the most effective solution. This paper focuses on the ‘integrated’ aspect of area-based policies in the Netherlands. We find that there is an unbalanced relationship between policies that focus on physical interventions and those that focus on social interventions. Also, findings show that some area-based initiatives claiming to be using an integrated approach are not. ‘Integration’ is often a term used by policy-makers but not implemented. This lack of integration is partly due to the limited flexibility in decision-making at the local level in dividing funds between and within the different policy fields...|$|E

However, the development and implementation of Smart City projects require considerable investments that are difficult to fund with traditional public finance. In this context, Public-Private-Partnerships (PPP) appear to be suitable solutions to overcome the shortage of public finance and cuts on public spending. However, the adoption of PPP forms for Smart City projects has not been fully explored and only experimentally applied so far. In order to promote the usage of PPP to finance Smart City initiatives, this paper proposes some PPP financial instruments and discusses the associated strengths and weaknesses. In particular, the use of Project Finance, Revenue Sharing and Social Impact Bonds are suggested as sound alternatives and suitable sources of financing for Smart City project...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{alternative}} spatial form for a university campus, which embeds itself within the region, {{in which it}} is located. The proposed campus spacing is inspired by recent research from the environmental psychology discipline, around Attention Restorative Theory (ART), along with its central four principles. Furthermore, the paper explores how a critical interpretation of Foucault’s six heterotopic principles, following Harvey, maps onto ART principles and reflexively unmasks the dialectic tensions of what is termed ‘restorative, heterotopic spacing’. In order to focus on the potential implications to campus sustainability, a specific campus initiative called the Oberlin Project will be critically explored, in relation to the potential enactment of ART, from an academic and local community perspective. It reflects on the significance of an artistic, regional set of trans-disciplinary <b>integrated</b> <b>initiatives</b> for such restorative spacing, within the expanded urban and regional notion of Oberlin campus.

40|$|In Cameroon, as {{in other}} {{countries}} of the Congo basin region, policy processes and activities related to climate change have been hitherto geared mostly towards mitigation and related questions, with limited concern about adaptation issues. However, the increasing vulnerability of Cameroon to climate variability and change makes adaptation significant to its national climate-change policy. Nonetheless, it remains a challenge to make both adaptation and mitigation occupy the same policy space in Cameroon. This paper builds partly on studies carried out in two community forest carbon initiatives in the southern rainforest of Cameroon. It also argues, supported by existing literature on adaptation and mitigation, that mitigation activities {{have the potential to}} produce adaptation outcomes; a situation which avoids duplication of efforts and waste of financial and technical resources, if synergetic options are anticipated and planned. However, whether such integrated approaches succeed and are subsequently reflected in national-level climate policy depends on how actors across different sectors and at different levels engage and carry out their roles. The paper discusses these roles and how they can support each other in pursuing <b>integrated</b> <b>initiatives</b> – a context which is vital for Cameroon. </p...|$|E
40|$|In many low-income {{countries}} with water re-sources, small fish species {{are important for}} the livelihoods, nutrition and income of the rural poor. The small size of fish favours frequent consump-tion by and nutrition of the rural poor, as these fish are captured, sold and bought in small quantities; used both raw and processed in traditional dishes; and are nutrient-rich. All small fish species are {{a rich source of}} animal protein, and – as they are eaten whole – have a very high content of bioavail-able calcium. Some are rich in vitamin A, iron, zinc and essential fats. Measures to improve manage-ment and increase culture and consumption of small fish include community-based management of common water bodies; culture of small fish in ponds and rice fields; use of small marine fish for direct human consumption, especially in vulnerable population groups; and improved handling, trans-portation, processing – especially drying – and mar-ket chains to reduce loss and increase accessibility, especially in hard to reach population groups.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that whilst {{wetlands}} deliver a wide range of services vital for human well-being, they are being rapidly degraded and lost. Losses tend to be higher where human populations are increasing most and demands for economic development are greatest. Multidisciplinary management approaches that integrate conservation and development objectives in wetlands are therefore urgently requested for by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. This paper describes the evaluation of 10 wetland management case studies from Asia, Africa and South America that adopted such an integrated approach. The evaluation assessed the outcomes of these <b>integrated</b> <b>initiatives</b> to identify conditions and processes for linking conservation and poverty reduction objectives in wetlands. The findings are also compared with other assessments of integrated approaches, particularly in terms of their effectiveness in optimizing conservation and poverty reduction outcomes. The results from our studies suggest an ongoing evolution of such integrated interventions, which also implies cycles of learning from past mistakes. Overall, our results highlight the significant variation between wetlands in types and quantities of services they provide and emphasize the need to view many ecological issues as social challenges for equitable solutions to both wetlands and people. The analysis further shows that the positive on-ground results owe much to the interdisciplinary problem analysis, whereby interventions can move from treating symptoms to addressing root causes. While no blueprint emerged on how to successfully integrate conservation and poverty reduction in wetlands, important lessons for future interventions were drawn...|$|E

40|$|Fruit and {{vegetable}} promotion {{programs in the}} European Union Abstract. Promoting fruit {{and vegetable}} consumption {{is one of the}} main objectives of food and nutrition policy interventions worldwide. Public institutions, non-governmental organizations, research and health agencies together with market stakeholders undertake <b>integrated</b> <b>initiatives</b> to inform consumers about the health benefits of everyday fruit and vegetable intake. In the European Union several campaigns aimed at increasing produce demand have been launched in the nineties to improve the dietary patterns of the general population or specific consumer groups, such as children. However statistics show that fruit and vegetable intake in most EU states including new members is much below the recommended level. School-aged children, women and employees are currently the main target groups of “ 5 a day ’ information and promotion activities aimed at increasing f&v consumption. In order to secure long-term effectiveness of such programs the main determinants of consumer choice in the food market should be monitored. Broad public-private partnerships, including producers and distributors seem to be the key to strengthening the efforts at “pushing ’ market demand. Some of the campaigns developed and implemented in the European Union countries can be described as “ 5 a day ’ best practices. The involvement of fruit and vegetable chain participants, cooperation and evaluation of undertaken interventions are further needed in order for the programs to become more efficient and widespread. Key words: fruit and vegetable market, consumption, promotion, 5 a da...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we briefly review {{the accomplishments of}} WEGENER as {{originally}} conceived (Working Group of European Geoscientists for the Establishment of Networks for Earth-science Research) and outline and justify the new focus of the WEGENER consortium. The remarkable and rapid evolution of {{the present state of}} global geodetic monitoring in regard to the precision of positioning capabilities (and hence deformation) and global coverage, the development of InSAR (INterferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) for monitoring strain with unprecedented spatial resolution, and continuing and planned data from highly precise satellite gravity and altimetry missions, encourage us to shift principal attention from mainly monitoring capabilities by a combination of space and terrestrial geodetic techniques to applying existing observational methodologies to the critical geophysical phenomena that threaten our planet and society. Our new focus includes developing an improved physical basis to mitigate earthquake, tsunami, and volcanic risks, and the effects of natural and anthropogenic climate change (sea level, ice degradation). In addition, expanded applications of space geodesy to atmospheric studies will remain a major focus with emphasis on ionospheric and tropospheric monitoring to support forecasting extreme events. Towards these ends, we will encourage and foster interdisciplinary, <b>integrated</b> <b>initiatives</b> to develop a range of case studies for these critical problems. Geological studies are needed to extend geodetic deformation studies to geologic time scales, and new modeling approaches will facilitate full exploitation of expanding geodetic databases.

40|$|Do big {{businesses}} {{have to play}} a role on their own in poverty alleviation? And if so, what are the means of action they are able and eager to implement? For decades, eradicating poverty has been a challenge tackled by public interventions, international development organizations, NGOs. Since the question raised about corporate responsibility, there have been more and more <b>integrated</b> <b>initiatives</b> aiming at reducing social and environmental negative impact of a company. Some are convinced there may be solutions beyond these reactive approaches, relying on more proactive projects putting the social issues in the core business vision. Social business being one of those ambitious approaches, makes the company move from its business as usual and development innovation standards to “open” “embedded” innovation leading to local market creation while addressing poverty issues. Veolia Water, in collaboration with Muhammad Yunus Founder of the Grameen Bank, decided to experiment this kind of business model innovation in Bangladesh where there is urging health concerns linked to water arsenic contamination. The experimental process helped the joint-venture adapt to novelty and complexity (contextual, socio-cultural, commercial) and progressively give birth to a real market and test an innovative business model. This learning by doing approach teaches a big company such as Veolia Water how to make the trade-off between short-term profitability and positive contribution to society through a business integrating social concerns in its value proposition. It can also lead to rethinking of its usual practices and contribute to put on a more global sustainable business perspective...|$|E

In the near term, females need access to basic services and opportunities. In the longer term the economic, cultural, and political environment must sustain improved circumstances for women in health, labor force participation, and other outcomes. Far deeper and more <b>integrated</b> <b>initiatives</b> are needed if long-standing trends in gender inequality are to be reversed. What role does public policy play? In many cases minor changes in laws and institutions can foster greater involvement by women {{in the public sphere}} to enable them to pursue activities that further enhance their autonomy and elevate their status.

40|$|Internationally, water {{management}} is {{moving from the}} traditional top-down approach to more <b>integrated</b> <b>initiatives</b> focussing on community-led action. With inadequacies in previous engagement initiatives undertaken through the first cycle of River Basin Management Planning for the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), the Republic of Ireland has only recently embraced this bottom-up approach. The attempted introduction of national charging for domestic water use in 2015 has resulted in significant public disquiet and protest movements against the national government. In April 2015 we undertook a survey of current opinion on {{water management}} and community engagement initiatives in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. A total of 520 survey responses identified that although freshwater bodies are important in peoples' lives, respondents were typically unaware of global initiatives such as Integrated Water Resources Management and Integrated Catchment Management. Overall, 81 % of respondents did not feel included in decisions about their water environment despite an overwhelming 95 % believing that local communities should {{have a say in}} how the water environment is managed. However, only 35. 1 % of respondents stated that {{they would be willing to}} attend local water management engagement initiatives. Rather than supporting individual gain, respondents identified social gains for the local community as avenues for increasing local involvement in water initiatives. In the Republic of Ireland, a water engagement initiative that implements the national framework local delivery model should be developed and implemented. This would 1) contribute to the second round of WFD River Basin Management Planning; 2) facilitate stronger connections between local communities and their water environment; and 3) foster bottom-up initiatives that empower communities regarding local water management issues...|$|E

It is known that entrepreneurship education increase self-reported intentions to begin a business. The biggest challenge in higher education is the breaking of traditional studies methods, where students and their families think in create new employees for other companies and not to create a new employer. Entrepreneurship education aims to produce graduates with a set of skills and an entrepreneurial mindset, in order to come up with original ideas in response to identified market shortfalls and needs.
