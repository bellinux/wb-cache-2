25|$|Stalin is too rude, {{and this}} fault, fully {{tolerable}} {{in our midst}} and in the relations among us Communists, becomes intolerable {{in the office of}} General Secretary. Therefore <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> to the comrades that they devise a way of shifting Stalin from this position and appointing to it another man who in all other respects falls {{on the other side of}} the scale from Comrade Stalin, namely, more tolerant, more loyal, more polite and considerate of comrades, less capricious and so forth.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, in {{the utopian}} worlds of the Greeks, there was often {{no place for}} prostitutes. In Aristophanes' play Assemblywomen, the heroine Praxagora {{formally}} bans them from the ideal city: Why, undoubtedly! Furthermore, <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> abolishing the whores … so that, instead of them, we may have the first-fruits of the young men. It is not meet that tricked-out slaves should rob free-born women of their pleasures. Let the courtesans be free to sleep with the slaves.(v.716–719). The prostitutes are obviously considered to be unfair competition. In a different genre, Plato, in the Republic, proscribed Corinthian prostitutes {{in the same way}} as Attican pastries, both being accused of introducing luxury and discord into the ideal city. The cynic Crates of Thebes, (cited by Diodorus Siculus, II, 55–60) during the Hellenistic period describes a utopian city where, following the example of Plato, prostitution is also banished.|$|E

First of all, I chose from the catalog wire rope hoist. <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> preliminary dimensions of mainbeam and crossbeam. I made strength check of mainbeam and crossbeam. For attachment mainbeam and crossbeam I chose fitted bolts. I calculated required number of fitted bolts M 12. From the standards I chose wheels. I checked the wheels to maximum contact pressure and service life. I chose bearings from catalog SKF. I checked the bearings to service life. <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> dimension of shafts. From the rolling resistance and friction, I calculated the power output of the engine. At the last <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> cable trolleys {{and control of the}} crane...|$|R

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>propose</b> in this {{narrative}} {{that it is}} sometimes extremely difficult and even impossible to determine sex during life. In one of the anatomical theaters of the hospital..., there arrived {{toward the end of}} January a cadaver which in life was the body of a certain Joseph Marzo... The general physiognomy was decidedly male in all respects. There were no feminine curves to the body. There was a heavy beard. There was some delicacy of structure with muscles that were not very well developed... The distribution of pubic hair was typical of the male. Perhaps the lower extremities were somewhat delicate, resembling the female, and were covered with hair... The penis was curved posteriorly and measured 6 cm, or with stretching, 10 cm. The corona was 3 cm long and 8 cm in circumference. There was an ample prepuce. There was a first grade hypospadias... There were two folds of skin coming {{from the top of the}} penis and encircling it on either side. These were somewhat loose and resembled labia majora.|$|E

25|$|It {{is at this}} point, the {{beginning}} of 1907, that <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> to bring this first volume to an end. The 25-year-old Picasso is about to conjure up a quintet of Dionysiac Demoiselles on his huge new canvas. The execution of this painting would make a dramatic climax to these pages. However, it would imply that Picasso's great revolutionary work constitutes a conclusion to all that has gone before. It does not. For all that the Demoiselles is rooted in Picasso's past, {{not to speak of}} such precursors as the Iron Age Iberians, El Greco, Gauguin and Cézanne, it is essentially a beginning: the most innovative painting since Giotto. As we will see in the next volume, it established a new pictorial syntax; it enabled people to perceive things with new eyes, new minds, new awareness. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon is the first unequivocally 20th-century masterpiece, a principal detonator of the modern movement, the cornerstone of 20th-century art. For Picasso it would also be a rite of passage: what he called an exorcism.' It cleared the way for cubism. It likewise banished the artist's demons. Later, these demons would return and require further exorcism. For the next decade, however, Picasso would feel as free and creative and 'as overworked' as God.|$|E

[...] In April 1922, Charleston, West Virginia's then mayor, Grant P. Hall, declared [...] "baseball pools, pay-ball, Kelly pool and all other forms of gambling in billiard parlors and cigar stores must cease forthwith." [...] Likewise, in December of the same year, Oxford, Ohio's then mayor, J. M. Hughes, declared a war on all forms of gambling, announcing in the local newspaper that [...] "schemes of chance... Kelly pool... are contrary to law." [...] In 1934, sports promoter and notorious gambler Jack Doyle's billiard establishment was raided and he, along with 14 patrons, were arrested for placing bets on Kelly pool.|$|E

On the morning of April 6, 1862, Grant's troops were taken by surprise when the Confederates, led by Generals Albert Sidney Johnston and P.G.T. Beauregard, struck first [...] "like an Alpine avalanche" [...] near Shiloh church, attacking five divisions of Grant's army and forcing a confused retreat toward the Tennessee River. Johnston was wounded and died during the engagement and command fell upon Beauregard. One Union line held the Confederate attack off for several hours at a place later called the [...] "Hornet's Nest", giving Grant time to assemble artillery and 20,000 troops near Pittsburg Landing. The Confederates finally broke through the Hornet's Nest to capture a Union division, but [...] "Grant's Last Line" [...] held Pittsburg Landing, while the exhausted Confederates, lacking reinforcements, halted their advance. That evening, heavy rain set in while Grant and his staff took cover and huddled around a fire. When asked by McPherson {{if he was going}} to retreat, Grant replied, [...] "Retreat? No. <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> to attack them at daylight and whip them." ...|$|E

40|$|Solving {{challenging}} {{problems with}} non-separable, multi-funnel, multi-property, asymmetrical characteristics are {{the targets of}} recent studies in continuous optimisation. In this thesis, <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> a local search-hybrid optimisation framework {{with a view to}} solving some problems belonging to the mentioned class. I tried to achieve this goal by following three approaches. Firstly, to utilise the strengths of both population-based and single-point based optimisa-tion methods, in the framework <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> a population of trajectory individuals, where each individual performs a single point based method. Secondly, I focused on combining some successful search strategies of existing meta-heuristics algorithms with some newly proposed ideas. Thirdly, to ensure that the suitable search strategy is automatically chosen when solving a certain problem, <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> a method allowing individuals exchange their knowledge with each other to adjust their behaviours adaptively. To implement this, I adopted the cultural adaptation paradigm from Cultural Algorithms...|$|R
