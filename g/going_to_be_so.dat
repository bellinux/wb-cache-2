25|$|Little-endian {{representation}} simplifies hardware in processors {{that add}} multi-byte integral values a byte at a time, such as small-scale byte-addressable processors and microcontrollers. As carry propagation must {{start at the}} least significant bit (and thus byte), multi-byte addition can then be carried out with a monotonically-incrementing address sequence, a simple operation already present in hardware. On a big-endian processor, its addressing unit has to be told how big the addition is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> that it can hop forward to the least significant byte, then count back down towards the most significant byte (MSB). On the other hand, arithmetic division is done starting from the MSB, so it is more natural for big-endian processors. However, high-performance processors usually fetch typical multi-byte operands from memory in {{the same amount of}} time they would have fetched a single byte, so the complexity of the hardware is not affected by the byte ordering.|$|E

He credited her for speaking clearly and for not losing her composure when the audience laughed at her.
