40|$|Honeybee colonies depend {{largely on}} the {{reproductive}} altruism of the worker bees, who usually remain sterile. We applied transcriptomics and proteomics for the comparison of 18 -day old workers with rudimentory vs. fully developed ovaries from dequeened colonies. Via microarray, we compared whole body RNA-extracts of 16 fertile & 16 sterile workers. In addition, we conducted 3 independent 2 D-DIGE experiments, comparing resp. brain, hemolymph and ovary samples of sterile vs <b>fertile</b> <b>worker</b> bees. Our microarrays demonstrate massive differences in gene expression between both type of workers. GO enrichment analysis demonstrated that ca. one quarter of GO-terms enriched for egg-laying workers were linked to oogenesis, mitosis or meiosis, whereas GO-terms enriched for non-laying workers were associated with wing muscle contraction, metabolism and flight behavior. Interestingly, this suggests that non-laying workers were foraging, whereas same-aged laying workers were not, in accord with theoretical predictions that reproductive workers should tend to carry out less work and less risky tasks inside the colony. The proteomics analysis of ovaries showed massive differences as well. Our findings suggest, among others, that suppression of ovary development might involve a constant interplay between primordial oogenesis and subsequent degradation; probably mediated through steroid and neuropeptide hormone signaling. Additionally, we observed higher viral loads in rudimentary ovaries. The 2 D-DIGE comparison of hemolymph samples showed surprisingly little differences. Fertile workers showed relatively more abundant immune response proteins, whereas sterile workers were carrying much higher loads of the Deformed wing virus (DWV). The comparison of brain samples showed 1 major difference between the proteome profiles of sterile & fertile workers: a protein of DWV. Overall, our data indicate {{a strong correlation between}} the sterile status of the ovaries and DWV load in different tissues. Especially the brain showed an on/off signal in contaminated colonies. Based on these findings, future research should explore whether DWV, associated with winter losses and CCD, influences behavior and/or contributes to the inactivation of worker ovaries. Also, ovary proteomics and microarray data yield a list of candidate genes for validation experiments assessing their potential functional involvement in controlling sterility & fertility in worker bees. status: publishe...|$|E

500|$|Worker {{policing}} is {{a behavior}} seen in colonies of social hymenopterans (ants, bees, and wasps) whereby worker females eat or remove eggs {{that have been}} laid by other workers rather than those laid by a queen. [...] Worker policing ensures that the offspring of the queen will predominate in the group. In certain species of bees, ants and wasps, workers or the queen may also act aggressively towards <b>fertile</b> <b>workers.</b> Worker policing has been suggested {{as a form of}} coercion to promote the evolution of altruistic behavior in eusocial insect societies.|$|R
5|$|Workers in {{colonies of}} the Asian honey bee, Apis florea, are also {{reported}} {{to engage in}} oophagy. Using microsatellite analysis, researchers concluded that no mature drones had non-queen alleles in the colonies they investigated.

5000|$|When a <b>fertile</b> female <b>worker</b> {{produces}} drones, {{a conflict}} arises between her interests {{and those of}} the queen. The worker shares half her genes with the drone and one-quarter with her brothers, favouring her offspring over those of the queen. The queen shares half her genes with her sons and one-quarter with the sons of <b>fertile</b> female <b>workers.</b> This pits the worker against the queen and other workers, who try to maximize their reproductive fitness by rearing the offspring most related to them. This relationship leads to a phenomenon known as [...] "worker policing". In these rare situations, other worker bees in the hive who are genetically more related to the queen's sons than those of the <b>fertile</b> <b>workers</b> will patrol the hive and remove worker-laid eggs. Another form of worker-based policing is aggression toward fertile females. Some studies have suggested a queen pheromone which may help workers distinguish worker- and queen-laid eggs, but others indicate egg viability as the key factor in eliciting the behavior. Worker policing is an example of forced altruism, where the benefits of worker reproduction are minimized and that of rearing the queen's offspring maximized.|$|R

50|$|Worker policing, {{manifested}} through aggressive {{actions against}} <b>fertile</b> <b>workers</b> and {{removal of the}} eggs of workers, has been observed in colonies of B. ignitus. Similarly, reproductive workers have been observed taking aggressive behavior against founding queens. These include eating the eggs laid by the queen and laying eggs themselves, as well as attacking the queen herself. In an analysis of seven B. ignitus colonies, the survival rate of colony founding queens was 72%. These queens had damaged wings or bodies, which suggests numerous conflicts with workers.|$|R
50|$|Bombus ignitus is {{a species}} of {{bumblebee}} in the family Apidae. It is mainly distributed in Eastern Asia, commonly found in China, Japan, and Korea. It is used in China and Japan commercially as a pollinator. B. ignitus is a eusocial insect with a queen that is monandrous - mating with only one male {{in the late summer}} before hibernating until the following spring. It builds its nest out of a mass of pollen and lays its eggs after completion. Due to numerous conflicts between queens and <b>fertile</b> <b>workers,</b> some surviving queens are badly injured, described by some as living corpses.|$|R
50|$|Workers in {{colonies of}} the Asian honey bee, Apis florea, are also {{reported}} {{to engage in}} oophagy. Using microsatellite analysis, researchers concluded that no mature drones had non-queen alleles in the colonies they investigated. Thus, even though workers had activated ovaries and were capable of laying eggs, worker policing ensured the functional sterility of otherwise <b>fertile</b> <b>workers.</b> A higher percentage of female workers of the bee species Apis cerana are reported to activate their ovaries than those of Apis mellifera or Apis florea. When queens were removed, up to 40% of the workers activated their ovaries in subsequent days. However, policing workers continued to eat the worker-laid eggs, suggesting that the mechanism of policing in this species does not involve direct intervention from the queen.|$|R
40|$|Context-dependent {{decision-making}} conditions individual plasticity {{and is an}} integrant part {{of alternative}} reproductive strategies. In eusocial Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps), the discovery of worker reproductive parasitism recently challenged the view of workers as a homogeneous collective entity and stressed the need to consider them as autonomous units capable of elaborate choices which influence their fitness returns. The reproductive decisions of individual workers thus need to be investigated and taken into account to understand the regulation of reproduction in insect societies. However, we know virtually nothing about the proximate mechanisms at the basis of worker reproductive decisions. Here, we test {{the hypothesis that the}} capacity of workers to reproduce in foreign colonies lies in their ability to react differently according to the colonial context and whether this reaction is influenced by a particular internal state. Using the bumble bee Bombus terrestris, we show that workers exhibit an extremely high reproductive plasticity which is conditioned by the social context they experience. <b>Fertile</b> <b>workers</b> reintroduced into their mother colony reverted to sterility, as expected. On the contrary, a high level of ovary activity persisted in <b>fertile</b> <b>workers</b> introduced into a foreign nest, and this despite more frequent direct contacts with the queen and the brood than control workers. Foreign workers' reproductive decisions were not affected by the resident queen, their level of fertility being similar whether or not the queen was removed from the host colony. Workers' physiological state at the time of introduction is also of crucial importance, since infertile workers failed to develop a reproductive phenotype in a foreign nest. Therefore, both internal and environmental factors appear to condition individual reproductive strategies in this species, suggesting that more complex decision-making mechanisms are involved in the regulation of worker reproduction than previously thought...|$|R
40|$|The eusocial {{societies}} of honeybees, where the queen {{is the only}} fertile female among tens of thousands sterile worker bees, have intrigued scientists for centuries. The proximate factors, which cause the inhibition of worker bee ovaries, remain largely unknown; as are the factors which cause the activation of worker ovaries upon the loss of queen and brood in the colony. In an attempt to reveal {{key players in the}} regulatory network, we made a proteomic comparison of hemolymph profiles of workers with completely activated ovaries vs. rudimentary ovaries. An unexpected finding of this study is the correlation between age matched worker sterility and the enrichment of Picorna-like virus proteins. <b>Fertile</b> <b>workers,</b> on the other hand, show the upregulation of potential components of the immune system.

40|$|In {{many species}} of social insects, the cuticular {{hydrocarbons}} of adults vary with both colony identity and individual physiology (oogenesis). Such variations have been shown in some ants and social wasps to function in nestmate recognition, but as {{yet there is no}} demonstration of their use by workers to recognize egg layers. We report that in the ant Myrmecia gulosa, workers can discriminate queens and <b>fertile</b> <b>workers</b> from infertile individuals based on distinctive blends of long-chained hydrocarbons present both on the cuticle and in the postpharyngeal gland. The purified hydrocarbon fraction of cuticular extracts from queens elicited high interest in workers, unlike the nonhydrocarbon fraction. However, both fractions were necessary to trigger a response of maximal intensity. In contrast, extracts of mandibular and Dufour glands from queens or infertile workers were not treated differentially by workers. We suggest that cuticular hydrocarbons function as pheromones allowing for recognition of the queen as well as egg-laying workers...|$|R
40|$|Social Hymenoptera {{demonstrate}} {{an extraordinary}} reproductive {{division of labour}} in which queens reproduce and sterile workers perform other colony tasks. To counteract a potential conflict of interests with <b>fertile</b> <b>workers,</b> queens emit pheromones that may act as honest signals of their fertility to which workers respond by refraining from reproduction, depending on how it enhances their inclusive fitness, or that may actively inhibit worker reproduction, against worker inclusive fitness. Most evidence across different groups of social insects endorses the queen signalling hypothesis, while the queen control hypothesis receives most support from the specialised honeybee queen mandibular pheromone (QMP). Recently, it was shown that QMP even works across species, suppressing ovary development of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster and suggesting some hormonal properties of these compounds. Here, we examined whether QMP also has this effect on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, {{as would be expected}} if these compounds directly influence reproductive physiology. We found that honeybee QMP indeed leads to significantly reduced ovary development in queenless bumblebee workers, showing that QMP evolved into a manipulative pheromone, shedding a new light on the ongoing discussion about honest signalling and queen control. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|In {{many social}} insect communities, sex is {{determined}} through haplodiploidy. Haploid male drones develop from unfertilized eggs while diploid females develop from fertilized eggs. Queens of a colony may mate {{with one or}} several drones. On average, a queen shares half of her genes with her sons, but only shares a quarter of her genes with the sons of <b>fertile</b> female <b>workers.</b> Therefore, {{it is in the}} queen's best interests to have her own sons raised, and not the sons of workers. Workers can reproduce in many ants, bees, and wasps because male offspring come from unfertilized eggs.|$|R
40|$|In eusocial organisms, some {{individuals}} specialize in reproduction {{and others in}} altruistic helping. The evolution of eusociality is, therefore, also the evolution of remarkable inequality. For example, a colony of honeybees (Apis mellifera) may contain 50 000 females all of whom can lay eggs. But 100 per cent of the females and 99. 9 per cent of the males are offspring of the queen. How did such extremes evolve? Phylogenetic analyses show that high relatedness was almost certainly necessary for the origin of eusociality. However, even the highest family levels of kinship are insufficient to cause the extreme inequality seen in e. g. honeybees via `voluntary altruism¿. `Enforced altruism¿ is needed, i. e. social pressures that deter individuals from attempting to reproduce. Coercion acts at two stages in an individual's life cycle. Queens are typically larger so larvae can be coerced into developing into workers by being given less food. Workers are coerced into working by `policing¿, in which workers or the queen eat worker-laid eggs or aggress <b>fertile</b> <b>workers.</b> In some cases, individuals rebel, such as when stingless bee larvae develop into dwarf queens. The incentive to rebel is strong as an individual is the most closely related to its own offspring. However, because individuals gain inclusive fitness by rearing relatives, {{there is also a}} strong incentive to `acquiesce¿ to social coercion. In a queenright honeybee colony, the policing of worker-laid eggs is very effective, which results in most workers working instead of attempting to reproduce. Thus, extreme altruism is due to both kinship and coercion. Altruism is frequently seen as a Darwinian puzzle but was not a puzzle that troubled Darwin. Darwin saw his difficulty in explaining how individuals that did not reproduce could evolve, given that natural selection was based on the accumulation of small heritable changes. The recognition that altruism is an evolutionary puzzle, and the solution was to wait another 100 years for William Hamilton...|$|R
40|$|In most animals, {{longevity}} {{is achieved}} {{at the expense}} of fertility, but queen honey bees do not show this tradeoff. Queens are both long-lived and <b>fertile,</b> whereas <b>workers,</b> derived from the same genome, are both relatively short-lived and normally sterile. It has been suggested, on the basis of results from workers, that vitellogenin (Vg), best known as a yolk protein synthesized in the abdominal fat body, acts as an antioxidant to promote longevity in queen bees. We explored this hypothesis, as well as related roles of insulin–IGF- 1 signaling and juvenile hormone. Vg was expressed in thorax and head fat body cells in an age-dependent manner, with old queens showing much higher expression than workers. In contrast, Vg expression in worker head was much lower. Queens also were more resistant to oxidative stress than workers. These results support the hypothesis that caste-specific differences in Vg expression are involved in queen longevity. Consistent with predictions from Drosophila, old queens had lower head expression of insulin-like peptide and its putative receptors than did old workers. Juvenile hormone affected the expression of Vg and insulin–IGF- 1 signaling genes in opposite directions. These results suggest that conserved and species-specific mechanisms interact to regulate queen bee longevity without sacrificing fecundity...|$|R
50|$|Worker bees secrete the wax used {{to build}} the hive, clean, {{maintain}} and guard it, raise the young and forage for nectar and pollen, {{and the nature of}} the worker's role varies with age. For the first ten days of their lives, worker bees clean the hive and feed the larvae. After this, they begin building comb cells. On days 16 through 20, workers receive nectar and pollen from older workers and store it. After the 20th day, a worker leaves the hive and spends the remainder of its life as a forager. Although worker bees are usually infertile females, when some subspecies are stressed they may lay <b>fertile</b> eggs. Since <b>workers</b> are not fully sexually developed, they do not mate with drones and thus can only produce haploid (male) offspring.|$|R
50|$|This species nests {{underground}} {{or on the}} surface. Nests {{are generally}} small colonies of fewer than 50 workers, but they aggressively defend their establishments. This is a eusocial bee, one that forms a colony that works together to rear young with labor divided amongst reproductive and non-reproductive castes. All the daily tasks in the nest are performed by worker bees of all age groups, but each age group specializes in a certain duties. The youngest workers, those {{just a few hours}} old, assist in incubating the pupae. Young workers in the next stage leave the nest to forage and defend the colony, and return to help feed the larvae. Older workers tend to work on building the nest and its honey chambers using wax. The oldest workers are more sedentary and more likely to stay and help incubate young. The queen has the task of laying eggs; as she becomes less <b>fertile,</b> aggressive young <b>workers</b> may battle for the opportunity to become the egg-layer.|$|R

In this study, the relative infestation levels of worker brood cells, mite fertility (mites that lay at least one egg) and reproductive rate (number of viable adult daughters per mother mite) of Varroa mite in worker brood cells of Apis m. carnica and Apis m. syriaca were compared in fall 2003 and summer 2004 at two locations in Jordan. The relative infestation levels in sealed worker brood cells ranged from 23 – 32 % in fall and 19 – 28 % in summer.
