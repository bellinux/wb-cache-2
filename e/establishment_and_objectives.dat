40|$|This thesis aims {{to present}} the {{contemporary}} legal criminal procedures in Saudi Arabia {{that are relevant to}} crimes of killing. The thesis is divided into five chapters; each chapter is divided into two or three sections; and every section contains various sub-sections. Part one in the first section of chapter one provides a general introduction to the criminal procedures, its <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> in Islamic law. Part two discusses the general essential elements that must exist in the analysis of every crime. The general divisions of crimes have been pointed out in this part, as well as importance of this classification in Islamic law. Section two of this chapter embodies two parts which reflect respectively the sources of criminal procedure, as the ground from which it derives its legal authority; in addition, it provides miscellaneous statistics that indicate the effect of Islamic criminal law on decreasing crime rate in Saudi Arabia. Chapter two consist of two sections in which crimes of killing are classified. Part one of the first section discuses the fundamental components of intentional killing; types of punishments imposed upon a murderer, and the infliction of the death penalty as aq'sas in Saudi Arabia. The contemporary legal methods and conditions to implement capital punishments in Saudi Arabia has been discussed {{in the second part of}} this section. The second section deals with unintentional crimes of killing which comprise quasi-murder and killing by mistake. The due punishments for such crimes have been detailed in the first part of this section. The Saudi legal system of blood-money has been elaborately discussed in the second part. Chapter three is divided into three sections, each section contains various parts. Part one and two in the first section concentrate on examining those crimes of killing that are committed by a group of people, who either directly or indirectly participated in the crime. The effect of circumstances of insanity, infancy and intoxication, on annulling criminal responsibility has been comprehensively discussed in the second section. The last section of this chapter focuses on examining the effect of certain extenuating circumstances, such as self-defence and defence of honour, upon criminal liability. Chapter four deals with the contemporary Saudi pre-trial criminal proceedings relevant to crimes of killing. The first section of this chapter comprises six parts. The discussion in these parts focuses upon the legal procedure of examining suspects, searching of private premises, and the rights of suspect during this stage of police investigation. Section two deals with the pre-trial legal procedure following the detection of crimes of killing. It also covers the legal process of pre-trial detention, release proceedings, and the rights of the detained person. Chapter five embodies three sections which provide a comprehensive discussion to the trial proceeding and the consequent procedure after the trial. This includes: the Saudi courts system; the rule of evidence for proving criminal cases; the procedures of hearing cases of crimes of killing; the rights of the accused during this stage; and the ensuing legal process required to implement the judgement...|$|E

The public-private partnership agreements were studied in order to answer the over-arching research question: How is an effective public-private partnership established, assessed, and evaluated in education? A descriptive case study methodology was used to study DRSS 2 ̆ 7 public-private partnership agreements to determine if goals <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> were established <b>and</b> whether or not the partnerships met those goals <b>and</b> <b>objectives.</b> This case study also included the development and testing of a proposed evaluation framework that will allow for consistent, systematic inquiry that can produce defensible assertions regarding the assessment and evaluation of public-private partnerships in education. Results of the case study support the findings that utilization of an evaluation framework can serve to make public-private partnerships more successful. Results also indicated that <b>establishment</b> of goals <b>and</b> <b>objectives</b> enable effective evaluation for informal partnerships but could not be definitively stated for formal partnerships {{due to the lack of}} data points.

40|$|Rapid transit {{is crucial}} to Metropolitan New York's economy and quality of life. However, the {{long-term}} effectiveness of the city's rapid transit system and the causes of its failures and successes are unknown. This research (1) examines the cost, capital investment, railway network, equipment, fares, and operations of rapid transit in New York from 1870 to 2010 and (2) examines long-term economic and political causes of effective and efficient rapid transit. The figures reveal three distinct eras: 1870 to 1940, characterized by unprecedented expansion and improvement; 1940 to 1980, characterized by stagnation and decline; and 1980 to 2010, characterized by stabilization and rejuvenation. Rising labor costs and declining productivity are the proximate cause of the system's past and present failures. The central implication {{of this research is}} that-in the long-term-the best means of achieving effective and efficient rapid transit is via government <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> protection of <b>objective,</b> secure, <b>and</b> just property rights for private ownership and operation. This is consistent with a substantial body of economic theory, albeit not conventional neoclassical economics, which frequently treats transit as a special case.

Typically involving a definition of purpose, <b>establishment</b> of goals <b>and</b> <b>objectives,</b> presentation of alternative solutions and the selection/recommendation of a viable proposal to realize the stated goal. A structured analysis of this process can enable the improved design <b>and</b> <b>establishment</b> of performance standards allowing the development of a review process for alternative plans. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate a select planning issue and its process in the City of East Providence; specifically, the municipal process of evaluating alternative plans. This study will also attempt to identify associated process shortcomings, methodological constraints and present recommendations enabling improved process application. Increasing municipal resource constraints, coupled with active community participation efforts are almost certain to create conflicts in values regarding the decision-making process. If the recommended plan is to be accepted, conflicts between groups must be addressed, as well as the development of an accurate, documentable and defensible evaluation methodology. With an increasing array of decision-making participants and a growing scarcity of public resources, public administrators must provide an accurate policy review procedures. This type of effort will ensure the delivery of acceptable and factual solutions to community demands and interests. It is imperative that public administrators comprehend the dynamics of the political process, where key variables can be identified and whose end results can be predicted (i. e. certain inputs produce given outputs).

40|$|Beach {{replenishment}} is {{a widely}} used method of controlling coastal erosion. To reduce erosional losses from wind, beach grasses are often planted on the replenishment sands. However, there is little information on the microbial populations in this material that may affect plant <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> growth. The <b>objectives</b> of this research were to document changes in the populations of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi and other soil microorganisms in replenishment materials and to determine whether roots of transplanted beach grasses become colonized by beneficial microbes. The study was conducted over a 2 -year period on a replenishment project in northeastern Florida. Three sampling locations were established at 1 -km intervals along the beach. Each location consisted of three plots: an established dune, replenishment sand planted with Uniola paniculata and Panicum sp., and replenishment sand left unplanted. Fungal and bacterial populations increased rapidly in the rhizosphere of beach grasses in the planted plots. However, no bacteria were recovered that could fix significant amounts of N 2. The VAM fungi established slowly on the transplanted grasses. Even after two growing seasons, levels of root colonization and sporulation were significantly below {{those found in the}} established dune. There was a shift in the dominant VAM fungi found in the planted zone with respect to those in the established dunes. The most abundant species recovered from the established dunes were Glomus deserticola, followed by Acaulospora scrobiculata and Scutellospora weresubiae. The VAM fungi that colonized the planted zone most rapidly were Glomus globiferum, followed by G. deserticola and Glomus aggregatum...|$|R
