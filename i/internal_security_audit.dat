Potential cloud computing consumers like to know whether the controls in cloud environments can adequately protect critical assets migrated into the cloud. We present a cloud <b>security</b> <b>audit</b> approach to enable users' evaluate cloud service provider offerings before migration, as well as monitoring of events after migration. Our approach entails a set of concepts such as actor, goals, monitoring, conditions, evidence and assurance to support <b>security</b> <b>audit</b> activities. These concepts are considered as a language for describing the properties necessary for cloud <b>security</b> <b>audit</b> both before and after migration. Finally, a real cloud migration use case is given to demonstrate the applicability of the <b>security</b> <b>audit</b> approach...|$|R

A majority of these are separate stand-alone agencies, though, a majority of bank supervisors are part of a central bank. The survey asked respondents about their governance structure and practices, as well as practices and policies related to public transparency and accountability. Most agencies reported having operational independence. Bank supervisors were unique in viewing financial stability as part of their mandate.
