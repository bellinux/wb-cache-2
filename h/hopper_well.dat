The common perception of a reciprocal relationship between stability and maneuverability is false for animals such as rapidly running cockroaches and crabs. Although many-legged, sprawled-postured arthropods can be highly statically stable (i. e. the center of mass lies within at least a tripod of support; Alexander, 1971), this static stability does not preclude dynamics from influencing locomotion (Ting et al., 1994). Force, velocity and inertia are important for maintaining stable motion, particularly at high speeds. For example, ignoring the dynamics of many-legged, sprawled-postured arthropods would have prevented the discovery that diverse legged animals can all be modeled by a simple spring-mass system (Blickhan and Full, 1987; Full, 1989; Full and Tu, 1990, 1991).

40|$|One {{approach}} to modeling fully developed shear flow of frictional granular materials {{is to use}} a yield condition and a flow rule, in an analogous way to that commonly employed in the fields of metal plasticity and soil mechanics. Typically, the yield condition of choice for granular materials is the Coulomb–Mohr criterion, as this constraint is relatively simple to apply {{but at the same time}} is also known to predict stresses that are in good agreement with experimental observations. On the other hand, there is no strong agreement within the engineering and applied mechanics community as to which flow rule is most appropriate, and this subject is still very much open to debate. This paper provides a review of the governing equations used to describe the flow of granular materials subject to the Coulomb–Mohr yield condition, concentrating on the coaxial and double shearing flow rules in both plane strain and axially symmetric geometries. Emphasis is given to highly frictional materials, which are defined as those granular materials that possess angles of internal friction whose trigonometric sine is close in value to unity.

Sander is the equipment that delivers various types of sand with desired sand rate demand and dumps the sand to the blender's sand hopper for hydraulic fracturing. Due to the limited capacity of sand <b>hopper</b> as <b>well</b> as the high amplitude of internal disturbance, it is a great challenge to maintain the hopper's sand level at a setting point. In this paper, a cascade control is developed for the Sander automation system to actively reject the internal disturbance. The cascade control employes an inner-loop PI control for tracking the disturbance and an outer-loop PI control for maintaining the sand level, respectively. A disturbance-amplitude-dependent gain scheduling algorithm is developed for the outer-loop control, which enables the control to adjust its time response to the amplitude of the disturbance. With the cascade control, the Sander automation system is able to actively reject the internal disturbance in the inner-loop and gradually compensate the static errors of sand rate and sand rate demand in the outer-loop. A relay feedback approach is developed to tune the PI gains for the inner-loop and outer-loop controls. Both simulation and hydraulic fracturing job testing results have verified that the cascade control is reliable and practical for the Sander automation system...|$|R

While {{empirical}} predictions of the flow rate, based on scaling laws, have existed {{for more than a}} century (Hagen 1852, translated in [1] - Beverloo et al. [2]), recent advances have be made on the understanding of the control parameters of the flow. In particular, using continuous modeling together with a mu(I) granular rheology seem to be successful in predicting the flow rate for large numbers of beads at the aperture (Staron et al. [3], [4]). Moreover Janda et al. [5] have shown that the packing fraction at the outlet plays an important role when the number of beads at the apeture decreases. Based on these considerations, we have studied experimentally the discharge flow of a granular media from a rectangular silo. We have varied two main parameters: the angle of the hopper, and the bulk packing fraction of the granular material by using bidisperse mixtures. We propose a simple physical model to describe the effect of these parameters, considering a continuous granular media with a dilatancy law at the outlet. This model predicts well the dependance of the flow rate on the <b>hopper</b> angle as <b>well</b> as the dependance of the flow rate on the fine mass fraction of a bidisperse mixture...|$|R
40|$|Investigations of the {{geological}} structure and seabed dynamics {{as well as}} the morphological and sedimentological effects of sand extraction generated by different mining techniques were carried out in Polish waters of the Baltic Sea, NW of the Gulf of Gdańsk, at a water depth of 15 – 17  m. Three research cruises took place: just before, directly after and 11  months after dredging operations. Seismoacoustic profiling, a multibeam echosounder, a side-scan sonar, a 3  m vibro-corer and a box-corer were used during the research cruises. The grain size distribution and 137 Cs content of the sand samples were determined. Marine shells were dated by the AMS 14 C technique and pollen analyses were carried out on samples of muddy sands lying below the marine sand. A 2 to 4. 5  m thick layer of marine sands lies on the boulder till and locally on late Pleistocene ice margin lake deposits. The 137 Cs content indicates that the 0. 4 – 0. 8  m thick sand layer is mobile during storms. After the dredging operations, four pits with diameters from 80 to 120  m, depths from 3 to 4. 5  m and slopes with gradients up to 30 – 55 ° were measured. Several smaller irregularly shaped pits and double furrows 30 – 150  m in length and 0. 3 – 0. 5  m in depth were found.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{increased}} interest in large-scale industrial use of lignocellulosic plant biomass as an alternative biofuel replacement of fossil fuels (coal) in power plant boilers. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a perennial energy crop {{has been one of}} the favorable feedstocks considered as a dedicated energy crop in existing systems. However, the physical and flow properties of switchgrass particulates differ from coal due to its inherent low bulk density, high aspect ratio and fibrous nature. Because of the very different characteristics of switchgrass compared to most bulk solids of rigid-plastic nature, the fundamental flow mechanics differ as well. This makes it difficult or impossible to feed switchgrass into utility boilers using existing handling equipment such as hoppers designed for coal. Thorough hopper design studies for irregular-shaped particulates such as switchgrass do not exist; this provided a need to investigate fundamental material properties of switchgrass particulates and their effect on the flow mechanics in hoppers under gravity discharge. ^ Relationships between particle and bulk properties of switchgrass ground to geometric mean sizes (dwg) of 0. 98, 0. 70 and 0. 34 mm by hammer milling through screen sizes, 6. 4, 3. 2 and 1. 6 mm, respectively, were evaluated. Particle size distribution decreased with size reduction indicating a smaller, more uniform particle size. Bulk density and particle density increased with size reduction indicating a less compressible bulk solid and improved handling. Particle shape (image analysis) suggested that the needle-shaped nature of switchgrass particles is an inherent characteristic that causes poor flowabilty and size reduction does not influence the shape of switchgrass particles. ^ Flow properties determined by shear testing provided relationships between compression and material strength. A comparison of flow properties to physical properties showed strong influences of particle size, particle size distribution and bulk density on the unconfined yield strength (UYS) and cohesion. Flow index values classified ground switchgrass of 0. 98 mm dwg as a cohesive poor-flowing material. Improved flow was suggested when switchgrass was ground through screen sizes smaller than 6. 4 mm, that is for dwg of 0. 70 and 0. 34 mm, respectively. ^ Dr. Andrew Jenike 2 ̆ 7 s (1964) hopper design principles were applied to the ground switchgrass material. Observed discharge openings through experimental hopper tests agreed quite well with calculated results of Jenike 2 ̆ 7 s method. A larger discharge opening was required for larger particle size and a less dense switchgrass bulk. Modeling of the hopper flow factor for Jenike 2 ̆ 7 s approach and experimental hopper testing suggested that the hopper half angle, particle-particle friction (effective angle of internal friction) and particle-wall friction (wall-friction angle) were significant factors affecting hopper design for switchgrass biomass. Comparing results of an established hopper design to actual observations allowed the hopper design to be evaluated for effects of changes induced by particle size reduction on bulk solid hopper design. ^ The results from this dissertation work provided a fundamental understanding of material properties that comprise the flow mechanics in <b>hoppers</b> as <b>well</b> as design. This developed understanding enables design options to be effectively assessed for modifying the process or hopper to provide reliable flow of bulk solids comprised of fibrous, irregular-shaped particulates. ...|$|R
40|$|Standard grammars {{classify}} the combinations with –free as non-hyponymic adjective-centred compounds (Huddleston and Pullum 2002 : 1646). Górska (1994 and 2001) is {{the first}} to refer to them as derivatives and discuss their meaning relation with adjectives ending in –less. She proposes a cognitive differentiation between their formations, suggesting that they differ with regards to meaning evaluation and human participation as well as conceptual metaphors they express. She also suggests that the privative adjectives in English are undergoing a change, but since her approach is synchronic, she does not analyse it further. My dissertation aims to investigate that change by providing a systematic examination of dictionary entries and corpora occurrences and explaining how –free evolved in the history of English. It also accounts for the resulting competition between counterparts ending in both –free and –less as well as the possible social and cultural changes that underlie the creation of combinations with –free which tend to be the more recent members of the pairs. It is divided in two parts. The first part is a diachronic investigation of the origins of –free. It explores the change of meaning expressed by its formations and the development of present-day combinations by means of the change of semantic functions (according to Huddleston and Pullum 2002) and grammar patterns (following Pattern Grammar by Francis et al. (1996 and 1998)). Since the results of my examinations suggest that –free might be a result of grammaticalisation, I continue to review traditional parameters (Lehmann 1995) and principles (<b>Hopper</b> 1991) as <b>well</b> as follow other successful studies of grammaticalisation from adjectives to suffixes in order to analyse the grammaticalisation of –free. The second part focuses on five representative pairs ending in –free and –less, i. e. carefree/careless, child-free/childless, pain-free/painless, sugar-free/sugarless and value-free/valueless. It investigates positive and negative evaluations (according to the positive/negative parameter by Hunston and Thomson 2000) associated with them, their collocates as well as collocate networks that I manually create (following Williams 1998 and Baker 2006) and compares their genre distribution. This study is innovative in providing an account of the origins of the combinations with –free in the history of English and proposing that it is undergoing grammaticalisation and becoming an adjectival suffix. It also investigates the relation of –free with –less, another suffix that developed from an adjective through grammaticalisation...|$|R
30|$|International railway {{transport}} {{is crucial for}} a country’s {{as well as a}} region’s economy, so a huge amount of research investigates the role and the function of international {{railway transport}} and regional economy. In this section we review the most important research on the organisation of international railway freight transport. A comprehensive review is given by Ben Akiva et al. [3], who divided freight transport into three categories: (1) global (international), (2) regional, and (3) local (urban). The global (international) category identifies two factors crucial for organising railway freight transport. The first one is the relation between economy and freight transport, and the second one is a dynamic optimisation with a game theory approach. Tavasszy and De Jong [20] examined key issues to do with modelling freight transport; {{one of the most important}} aspects in freight transport is a demand modelling. Afterwards a research of freight generation connected with freight trip generation models and flow by distribution problems in freight transport was conducted. An excellent case study of freight trip generation in the New York City Metropolitan Area is provided. Rich et al. [18] introduced a weighted logit freight mode-choice model. They found a way to establish suitable decoupling of agents and shipments and determined transport demand elasticities with respect to monetary cost and travel time. Crisalli et al. [6] investigated the connection between rail and road freight policy for long-distance freight transport with an emphasis on freight demand. Islam and Eidhammer [11] explored Pan-European and international rail freight services. Other recent examples of such a research include CREAM [5], RETRACK [17], Islam et al. [14] and Islam et al. [13]. The CREAM [5] study, co-funded by the European Commission within the Sixth Framework Programme, contained a number of technological and operational research and development activities identified by the stakeholders, who comprised rail infrastructure operators, railway operators, intermodal operators and their customers. The CREAM study claims credit for a substantial increase in rail freight transport on this important East–west freight corridor which contributed to the EU transport policy goals. The RETRACK [17] study, co-funded by the European Commission within the Sixth Framework Programme, aimed to contribute to the Commission’s aspirations of a modal shift of freight traffic from road to rail with a market share of 15  % by 2020 to achieve a commercial viability and contribute to sustainable mobility. Islam et al. [13] conducted research to determine future (2030 and 2050) fleet size and found, among others, that significantly more rolling stock (in particular flat wagons, covered wagons and covered <b>hopper</b> wagons) as <b>well</b> as improved asset utilisation would be vital to facilitate the transport of increased freight volume as required in the EU Transport White Paper 2011 European Commission [8]. Another important aspect of international railway freight transport was examined by Islam et al. [14]. They established six key performance indicators (KPI) in transport chains: (1) transport cost, (2) transport time, (3) flexibility, (4) reliability, (5) quality, and (6) sustainability. Biškup [4] conducted research on the organisation of international freight transport between the European Union countries and Ukraine. He established main indicators that produced bottlenecks on the borders. He points out that technical problems have been eliminated or significantly reduced over the years but organisational and technological issues still need to be addressed in the interest of time and cost savings at border stationsIslam et al. [12] looked at the impact of EU transport in a White Paper in rail freight demand forecast. They suggested that demand for railway freight transport would grow significantly, especially when considering the high scenarios, that is very optimistic, but possibly there exists a necessitating investment in technologies, infrastructure and terminals so that the railway sector would be able to increase productivity significantly.|$|R
