NWs of micrometers length and diameter {{in the range}} of 20 – 200 nm are fabricated using this method under N-rich conditions. Driving mechanisms of the NW nucleation and the growth are discussed. The NWs have been investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and photoluminescence (PL). Electric and photoelectric measurements on single wire devices have been performed as well. We establish that the dark, Ultraviolet (UV) photo-current and band-edge absorption tails in GaN NWs are strongly dependent on wire diameter. A model of surface Fermi level pinning and Franz-Keldysh effect in carrier depletion region at wire surface were used to explain the observed behaviors.

The I-V {{curve of the}} InSb nanowires based on the M-S-M model shows low resistivity ρ of 0.07 [*]Ω[*]cm owing {{to the existence of}} Sb vacancies.

The accumulation layer occurs at the surface of InSb nanowires. The surface accumulation layer in the InSb conduction band causes a downward band bending near the surface region that eventually leads to lowering of the electron tunneling barriers. Moreover, a sufficient spacing between the InSb nanoemitter can significantly reduce the screening effect. Consequently, the vertically aligned InSb nanowires exhibit an extremely low turn-on field of 1.84 [*]V[*]μm− 1 and an estimative threshold field at 3.36 [*]V[*]μm− 1 when the current density was 1 [*]μA[*]cm− 2 and 0.1 [*]mA[*]cm− 2, respectively.

30|$|Zinc oxide (ZnO) has {{attracted}} much attention {{because it has a}} large exciton binding energy of 60  meV, a <b>high</b> <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> >[*] 1019  cm− 3, and a strong cohesive energy of 1.89  eV. [13, 14] Additionally, the lattice mismatch between ZnO and Ga 2 O 3 is within 5 % [15]. Various deposition techniques have been developed to prepare ZnO film, including hydrothermal method [16, 17] and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). [18] However, hydrothermal method need a complicated process and the grow rate is quiet slow, and CVD generally requires quiet high growth temperature above 900  °C. These drawbacks make it challenging to be applied in devices. Recently, atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as a promising technique, which exhibits excellent step coverage, atomic scale thickness controllability, good uniformity, and a relatively low deposition temperature. Consequently, atomic-layer-deposited ZnO on wide-bandgap semiconductors can reduce interface disorder and yield more controllable sample to examine the energy band alignment, which {{plays an important role in}} the carrier transport process [19]. Up to now, band alignment between Ga 2 O 3 and atomic-layer-deposited ZnO has not been studied by experiment, although there are some reports about the theoretical band alignment of ZnO and Ga 2 O 3. [20] Therefore, understanding the energy band alignment of atomic-layer-deposited ZnO/β-Ga 2 O 3 heterojunction is highly desirable for the design and physical analysis of relevant devices in the future. In this work, the energy band alignment of atomic-layer-deposited ZnO on β-Ga 2 O 3 was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Moreover, the influence of growth temperature of ZnO on the band alignment was also addressed.|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} recent {{interest in the}} use of surfacefunctionalized thin film and nanowire wide bandgap semiconductors, principally GaN, InN, ZnO and SiC, for sensing of gases, heavy metals, UV photons and biological molecules. For the detection of gases such as hydrogen, the semiconductors are typically coated with a catalyst metal such as Pd or Pt to increase the detection sensitivity at room temperature. Functionalizing the surface with oxides, polymers and nitrides is also useful in enhancing the detection sensitivity for gases and ionic solutions. The wide energy bandgap of these materials make them ideal for solar-blind UV detection, which can be of use for detecting fluorescence from biotoxins. The use of enzymes or adsorbed antibody layers on the semiconductor surface leads to highly specific detection of a broad range of antigens of interest in the medical and homeland security fields. We give examples of recent work showing sensitive detection of glucose, lactic acid, prostate cancer and breast cancer markers and the integration of the sensors with wireless data transmission systems to achieve robust, portable sensors. Semiconductor-based sensors can be fabricated using mature techniques from the Si chip industry and/or novel nanotechnology approaches. Silicon based sensors are still the dominant component of the semiconductor segment due to their low cost, reproducible and controllable electronic response. However, these sensors are not suited for operation in harsh environments, for instance, high temperature, high pressure or corrosive ambients. Si will be etched by some of the acidic or basic aqueous solutions encountered in biological sensing. By sharp contrast, GaN is not etched by any acid or base at temperatures below a few hundred degrees. Therefore, wide band-gap group III nitride compound semiconductors (AlGaInN materials system) are alternative options to supplement silicon in these applications because of their chemical resistance, high temperature/high power capability, <b>high</b> <b>electron</b> saturation velocity and simple integration with existing GaN-based UV light-emitting diode, UV detectors and wireless communication chips. A promising sensing technology utilizes AlGaN/GaN <b>high</b> <b>electron</b> mobility transistors (HEMTs). HEMT structures have been developed for use in microwave power amplifiers due to their <b>high</b> two-dimensional <b>electron</b> gas (2 DEG) mobility and saturation velocity. The conducting 2 DEG channel of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs is very close to the surface and extremely sensitive to adsorption of analytes. HEMT sensors can be used for detecting gases, ions, pH values, proteins, and DNA. The GaN materials system is attracting much interest for commercial applications of green, blue, and UV light-emitting diodes (LEDs), laser diodes as well as high speed and high frequency power devices. Due to the wide-bandgap nature of the material, it is very thermally stable, and electronic devices can be operated at temperatures up to 500 °C. The GaN-based materials are also chemically stable, and no known wet chemical etchant can etch these materials; this makes them very suitable for operation in chemically harsh environments. Due to the <b>high</b> <b>electron</b> mobility, GaN material based <b>high</b> <b>electron</b> mobility transistors (HEMTs) can operate at very high frequency with higher breakdown voltage, better thermal conductivity, and wider transmission bandwidths than Si or GaAs devices. An overlooked potential application of the GaN HEMT structure is sensors. The <b>high</b> <b>electron</b> sheet carrier <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> nitride HEMTs is induced by piezoelectric polarization of the strained AlGaN layer in the hetero-junction structure of the AIGaN/GaN HEMT and the spontaneous polarization is very large in wurtzite Ill-nitrides. This provides an increased sensitivity relative to simple Schottky diodes fabricated on GaN layers or field effect transistors (FETs) fabricated on the AIGaN/GaN HEMT structure. The gate region of the HEMT can be used to modulate the drain current in the FET mode or use as the electrode for the Schottky diode. A variety of gas, chemical and health-related sensors based on HEMT technology have been demonstrated with proper surface functionalization on the gate area of the HEMTs, including the detection of hydrogen, mercury ion, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), DNA, and glucose. ...|$|R

40|$|Dimethyltelluride {{has been}} used as a dopant source for GaSb epilayers grown via {{atmospheric}} pressure metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). It has been observed that the <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> (n) is proportional to the Te partial pressure in the vapour phase, until n saturates at high Te partial pressure. <b>Electron</b> <b>concentrations</b> as <b>high</b> as 1. 36 × 1018 cm– 3 have been measured with imperfect morphology, and as high as 1. 22 × 1018 cm– 3 with excellent, mirror like, morphology. These appear to be the <b>highest</b> <b>electron</b> <b>concentrations</b> reported to date for any MOCVD-growth epitaxial n-type GaSb doped with DMTe and grown at 540 °C with a V/III ratio of 1. 4. The absorption spectra of GaSb doped with DMTe show that the heavily doped samples have a less abrupt edge. The absorption coefficient (±) strongly depends on the free carrier <b>concentration.</b> PL spectra <b>of</b> the epilayers are also reported...|$|R
