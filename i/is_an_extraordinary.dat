5|$|Researchers {{have looked}} for {{evidence}} of {{the driving force behind}} the name-letter effect outside the lab. A body of controversial research under the umbrella ofimplicit egotism, starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or name. Sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>extraordinary</b> claim that requires extraordinary evidence.|$|E
5|$|While {{reports by}} owners of fitting names are of interest, some {{scientists}} have questioned their value {{in deciding whether}} nominative determinism is a real effect. Instead, {{they argue that the}} claim that a name affects life decisions <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>extraordinary</b> one that requires extraordinary evidence. To select only those cases that seem to give evidence for nominative determinism is to ignore those that do not. Analysis of large numbers of names is therefore needed. In 2002 Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones analysed various databases containing first names, surnames, occupations, cities and states. In one study they concluded that people named Dennis gravitate towards dentistry. They did this by retrieving the number of dentists called Dennis (482) from a database of US dentists. They then used the 1990 Census to find out which male first name was the next most popular after Dennis: Walter. The likelihood of a US male being called Dennis was 0.415% and the likelihood of a US male being called Walter was 0.416%. The researchers then retrieved the number of dentists called Walter (257). Comparing the relative frequencies of Dennis and Walter led them to their conclusion that the name Dennis is over-represented in dentistry. However, in 2011, Uri Simonsohn published a paper in which he criticized Pelham et al. for not considering confounding factors and reported on how the popularity of Dennis and Walter as baby names has varied over the decades. Given Walter was a relatively old-fashioned name it was far more likely for Pelham et al. to find people named Dennis to have any job, not just that of dentist, and people named Walter to be retired. Simonsohn did indeed find a disproportionally high number of Dennis lawyers compared to Walter lawyers.|$|E

25|$|As for the {{required}} vocal {{range of the}} title role, it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>extraordinary</b> case: The highest note is the high B5, not irregular for a soprano or mezzo-soprano to sing, while the lowest note is a low G3, in the contralto range and officially below the standard range for a mezzo-soprano. Considering this range, {{which is similar to}} many mezzo roles (such as Carmen and Amneris), one might assume that a high soprano is not essential to the piece, but it is; most of the relatively low sopranos who attempted this role found themselves straining their voices throughout the opera, and having reached the closing scene (the {{most important part of the}} opera for the title role) were very fatigued. This role is the classic example of the difference between tessitura and absolute vocal range: While mezzos can perform a high note (like Carmen), or even temporarily sustain a high tessitura, it is impossible for a singer to spend such a long time (with the needed strength and breath-control) in the second octave above the middle C unless she is a high soprano. Moreover, the low G occurs twice in the opera, and in both cases it is in pianissimo—more of a theatrical effect than music—and can be growled instead of sung. The other low notes required are no lower than low A, and they are also quiet.|$|E

500|$|Early press {{coverage}} was [...] "mixed", generally {{a combination of}} [...] "embarrassment and puzzlement".

[...] The Sydney newspaper Truth on 5 January 1921 expressed a similar view; [...] "For the true explanation of these fairy photographs what is wanted is not a knowledge of occult phenomena but a knowledge of children." [...] Some public figures were more sympathetic. Margaret McMillan, the educational and social reformer, wrote: [...] "How wonderful that to these dear children such a wonderful gift has been vouchsafed." [...] The novelist Henry De Vere Stacpoole decided to take the fairy photographs and the girls at face value. In a letter to Gardner he wrote: [...] "Look at Alice's [...] face.

500|$|Researchers {{have looked}} for wider {{implications}} of the birthday-number effect on preferences, {{both inside and outside}} the lab. A body of controversial research under the umbrella ofimplicit egotism, starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or [...] birthday numbers. Sceptics say that the claim that letters influence life decisions <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>extraordinary</b> one that requires extraordinary evidence. Based on analysis of US field data Pelham et al. concluded that people disproportionately live in towns whose names contain numbers that match the numbers in their birthday. They looked at people who were born on 2 February, 3 March, 4 April, etc. up to 8 August, and at people who lived in towns with numbers in them, such as Two Rivers, Three Oaks, Four Corners, etc. But in his critical analysis of this study Simonsohn argued that its reliability is questionable, as it found only a small number of residents with matching numbers. Simonsohn tried to replicate the finding in different ways but without success. He found no effect of just the day of birthday on the town (e.g. the 2nd of any month, not just February). He also found no effect of birthday number on street, address, or apartment number.|$|E
500|$|Patrick Kolan of IGN Australia awarded it {{a perfect}} 10/10 and said, [...] "It's the Watchmen film you {{always wanted to}} see, but never {{expected}} to get." [...] Also praising the film along with another perfect score (4/4) was Kyle Smith of the New York Post, comparing it to some of Stanley Kubrick's films: [...] "Director Zack Snyder's cerebral, scintillating follow-up to 300 seems, to even a weary filmgoer's eye, as fresh and magnificent in sound and vision as [...]" [...] Roger Ebert gave it four out of four stars and wrote, [...] "It's a compelling visceral film—sound, images and characters combined into a decidedly odd visual experience that evokes {{the feel of a}} graphic novel." [...] Richard Corliss of Time concluded [...] "this ambitious picture is a thing of bits and pieces," [...] yet [...] "the bits are glorious, the pieces magnificent." [...] Total Film awarded it 4/5 stars, stating: [...] "It's hard to imagine anyone watching the Watchmen as faithfully as Zack Snyder's heartfelt, stylised adap. Uncompromising, uncommercial, and unique." [...] When comparing the film to the original source material, Ian Nathan of Empire felt that while [...] "it isn't the graphic novel... Zack Snyder clearly gives a toss, creating a smart, stylish, decent adaptation." [...] Nick Dent of Time Out Sydney gave the film 4/6 in his review of February 25, praising the film's inventiveness but concluding, [...] "While Watchmen is still as rich, daring, and intelligent an action film as there's ever been, it also proves Moore absolutely right [...] As a comic book, Watchmen <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>extraordinary</b> thing. As a movie, it's just another movie, awash with sound and fury." ...|$|E

The album was originally to be released after her third compilation album, Cosa Nostra: Hip-Hop (2006), as an concept album which would have Ivy Queen performing duets with female singers from different genres on new label Filtro Musik.
