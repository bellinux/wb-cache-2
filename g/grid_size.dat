It can be found that when the <b>gridding</b> <b>size</b> is 0. 028 times the charge caliber or less, the formation of penetrator can be good with the trail result. It obtained the change curve of the model nodes and the calculating time of certain computer with the <b>size</b> of <b>gridding.</b> When the <b>gridding</b> <b>size</b> is from 0. 022 to 0. 028 times the charge caliber, the model nodes diminish 30. 8 %, and the calculating time decreases 42. 9 %. It obtains the effects of calculating <b>gridding</b> <b>size</b> on the multimode penetrator formation parameters, such as velocity and length-diameter ratio.

40|$|Abstract: The model CASC 2 D-SED {{was applied}} to the Goodwin Creek {{experimental}} watershed in Mississippi to define erosion model response to raster-based <b>grid</b> cell <b>sizes.</b> The model was parameterized at a 30 m grid, then calibrated and validated to three representative thunderstorms. The simulated hydrographs replicated the measurements of peak discharge, runoff volume, and time to peak. The model also calculated sediment yields within 50 % of the field measurements. Resampling the watershed digital elevation model at scales from 30 m to 330 m reduced the land surface slopes and changed the channel topology. In general, very good modeling results are obtained at <b>grid</b> <b>sizes</b> of 30 m and 90 m, which is comparable to the plot sizes of the universal soil loss equation. At <b>grid</b> <b>sizes</b> coarser than 150 m, the sediment source areas became less appropriately depicted and the calculated sediment delivery ratios became unrealistically high. <b>Grid</b> <b>sizes</b> smaller than 150 m are recommended for proper watershed simulation of upland erosion and sediment yield...|$|R

40|$|Nearly 100 % of U. S. {{artichoke}} production {{comes from}} California and {{is concentrated in}} Monterey County. California meadow voles are damaging rodent pests that can threaten the profitability of growing artichokes. A practical population monitoring method can be invaluable to integrated pest management programs for guiding when and where control is needed and assessing control efficacy. The standard method for indexing vole populations in artichoke fields {{has been based on}} observing chewing on artichoke bracts placed throughout the field. Because toxicants are delivered on artichoke bracts, bias for population indexing is potentially introduced. We therefore compared artichoke bracts to nontoxic grain-based wax bait blocks as an alternative chewing medium for eliciting chewing observations for indexing abundance. We also compared the use of binary (presence-absence) observations of chewing to continuous measures (percent chewed). We considered the effect of three <b>sizes</b> of observation <b>grids</b> (4 x 4, 5 x 5, 6 x 6) for indexing. We conducted intensive trapping to determine number of voles known to be alive (KTBA) at each site as a basis for assessing which of the 12 indexing approaches (2 chewing mediums, 2 measurement types, 3 <b>grid</b> <b>sizes)</b> best tracked population abundance. The percent chewed on artichoke bracts for all <b>grid</b> <b>sizes</b> only marginally correlated with KTBA (~ 0. 5), whereas percent chewed on bait blocks correlated very well with KTBA for all <b>grid</b> <b>sizes</b> (~ 0. 9). Reducing continuous data to binary observations produced indices only weakly or negatively correlated with KTBA. Available resources would probably determine whether smaller <b>grid</b> <b>sizes</b> would be used for obtaining chewing observations...|$|R

5000|$|In meteorology, {{multiscale}} modeling is {{the modeling}} {{of interaction between}} weather systems of different spatial and temporal scales that produces the weather that we experience.

40|$|Grid-based {{urbanization}} velocity {{analysis of}} remote sensing imagery {{is used to}} measure urban growth rates. However, it remains unclear how critical the spatial resolution of the imagery is to such grid-based approaches. This research therefore investigated how urbanization velocity estimates respond to different spatial resolutions, {{as determined by the}} <b>grid</b> <b>sizes</b> used. Landsat satellite images of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in China from the years 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 were hierarchically aggregated using different <b>grid</b> <b>sizes.</b> Statistical analyses of urbanization velocity derived using different spatial resolutions (or <b>grid</b> <b>sizes)</b> were used to investigate the relationships between socio-economic indicators and the velocity of urbanization for 27 large cities in PRD. The results revealed that those cities with above-average urbanization velocities remain unaffected by the spatial resolution (or grid-size), and the relationships between urbanization velocities and socio-economic indicators are independent of spatial resolution (or <b>grid</b> <b>sizes)</b> used. Moreover, empirical variogram models, the local variance model, and the geographical variance model all indicated that coarse resolution version (480 m) of Landsat images based on aggregated pixel yielded more appropriate results than the original fine resolution version (30 m), when identifying the characteristics of spatial autocorrelation and spatial structure variability of urbanization patterns and processes. The results conclude that the most appropriate spatial resolution for investigations into urbanization velocities is not always the highest resolution. The resulting patterns of urbanization velocities at different spatial resolutions {{can be used as a}} basis for studying the spatial heterogeneity of other datasets with variable spatial resolutions, especially for evaluating the capability of a multi-resolution dataset in reflecting spatial structure and spatial autocorrelation features in an urban environment...|$|R
