5000|$|<b>Felled</b> <b>seam,</b> or flat-fell seam, is a seam made {{by placing}} one edge inside a folded edge of fabric, then {{stitching}} the fold down. It includes a topstitched finish. It {{is useful for}} keeping seam allowances flat and covering raw edges.|$|E
40|$|Planning for {{the work}} in this project. In order to be {{eligible}} for the 4 -H Girl 2 Ì† 7 s Room project, the member should be 12 years of age and should know the following things about sewing: 1. The tools necessary for good sewing. 2. How to make simple stitches such as basting, running, hemming, overcast, and overhand. 3. How to use the sewing machine. 4. How to make a plain seam, a French seam, and a <b>felled</b> <b>seam.</b> 5. How to make a hem and facing. 6. How to put on a fias facing and binding...|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the normal lockstitch, construction stitches include edgestitching, understitching, staystitching and topstitching. Seam types include the plain seam, zigzag <b>seam,</b> flat <b>fell</b> <b>seam,</b> French seam, and many others.|$|R
50|$|The {{garments}} are characteristically {{designed to}} allow bending at the knee and hip, and are sewn with <b>felled</b> <b>seams</b> for strength and durability.|$|R
50|$|The {{dominating}} rock type in {{the area}} is limestone, but millstone grit forms outcrops extensively on Great Shunner <b>Fell,</b> and coal <b>seams</b> have also been worked on its slopes.|$|R
25|$|Bowler's top {{score in}} {{first-class}} cricket was 241 not out. Even in 1992, when he possessed his highest season average, of nearly 66 runs, {{he failed to}} get a call-up by the England selectors, particularly {{at a time when}} Derbyshire's wickets were more suspect to being <b>felled</b> by clever <b>seam</b> bowlers.|$|R
40|$|Several minor lignite {{deposits}} of Palaeogene (Eocene to Oligocene) age {{occur in the}} vicinity of Alexandroupolis, Thrace, northern Greece. A <b>fell,</b> rather thin <b>seams</b> were mined in the past by small private operations for local use. Coal samples have been collected front old mine dumps and outcrops around abandoned mine posts to be studied by means of maceral analysis at high magnification. The groundwater and vegetation index are calculated from the maceral composition and used to draw conclusions concerning the environment of deposition. In addition, block samples of coal cut perpendicular to bedding were studied at intermediate magnification and underfluorescence thus revealing some interesting bedding features as well as well-preserved plant organisms. The coals are characteristically finely laminated and highly gelified. Palynological preparations have thus far yielded only, poorly preset-lied palynomorph assemblages rather low in diversity and dominated by fern spores. This fern dominance is rather unusual: however, it is compatible with the occurrence of fertile fern fronds observed in petrographic coal sections. Accompanying clastic sediments exhibit cyclic fining-upward sequences at a scale averaging about 1 m in vertical extent. Grain sizes range from small gravel to clay and silt. In some cases, siltstones in the roof of coal seams include abundant plant fragments showing parallel venation. The evidence presented front various sources suggests a rather unstable fluvial environment and a generally high water table on the flood plain for the formation of these lignites...|$|R
