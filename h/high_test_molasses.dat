40|$|The {{growth of}} Lactobacillus fermentum was studied in mixed culture with Saccharomyces cerevisiae during {{alcoholic}} fermentation of <b>high</b> <b>test</b> <b>molasses</b> (HTM). Yeast extract {{or a group}} of 17 amino acids caused a strong and fast decrease in yeast viability due to the strong increase of acidity produced by bacteria. Pure culture of Lactobacillus fermentum in dry sugar cane broth confirmed amino acids as the main nutrients needed to stimulate the growth of bacterial contaminant during alcoholic fermentation. The absence of L. fermentum growth was obtained when leucine, isoleucine or valine were not added to the medium. Phenylalanine, alanine, glutamic acid, cystine, proline, histidine, arginine, threonine, tryptophane, serine and methionine inhibited the bacterial growth at least in one of the cultures of L. fermentum tested...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposal}} {{of this work}} was to {{study the effects of}} lecithin and soy oil on the fermentative performance of Saccharomyces tn,arum I Z 1904, a yeast used in the industrial production of ethanol. <b>High</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Molasses</b> (HTM) was chosen as the fermentation media because it is a substratum that is poor in nutrients, and because it permits one to distinguish the action of lipids from other nutritional factors. The study of the optimization of the concentration of lipids by surface response analysis showed that the lipids favor the performance of the yeast principally when applied separately. Maximum concentrations of the two sources of lipids in the media stimulated the budding rate but did not constitute a protection against cell death. Considering the action of lipids on the cellular parameters studied, the supplementation of the media with 3. 0 g/l of soy oil permitted the obtention of maximum responses of cellular viability, budding rate and viability of the buds after 6 successive cycles. In relation to the fermentative parameters, the use of 1. 5 g/l of soy oil provided high yields and an equilibrium between the mass of ethanol produced (EM) and the alcoholic yield (Y-p/s), whereas the cellular viability after 6 cycles did not differ statistically from that observed with 3 g/l of oil...|$|E
50|$|More generally, {{the bias}} in test scores (the fact that {{successful}} Asian applicants have <b>higher</b> <b>test</b> scores than successful applicants overall) is ascribed to applicants being judged {{on more than}} test scores. Stated formally, rather than <b>higher</b> <b>test</b> scores among successful Asian applicants meaning that an individual Asian applicant must meet a higher bar than an otherwise identical non-Asian applicant, it may simply be a reflection that Asians have relatively <b>higher</b> <b>test</b> scores: compared to the overall applicant pool, Asians have <b>higher</b> <b>test</b> scores, and a borderline Asian applicant will have <b>higher</b> <b>test</b> scores, but be lower on other measures, than the average borderline applicant.|$|R
40|$|For mass {{production}} of V. lecanii, {{three types of}} cultivation methods including liquid, solid and diphasic production systems were investigated. In the liquid state of production, six media were tested in stationary culture conditions. Among the six media <b>tested,</b> <b>Molasses</b> Yeast Broth (MYB) supported maximum sporulation (8. 33 x 10 8 spores mL - 1) and bio{{mass production}} (746 mg/ 100 mL). In the MYB, 4 % molasses concentration was found to produce highest spore count (8. 56 x 10 8 spores mL - 1) and biomass (776 mg/ 100 mL) followed by 5 and 6 % molasses. Among the six solid substrates tested, rice grains supported highest spore production (1. 14 g/ 100 g). In diphasic state of production, combination of MYB and rice grains produced {{the greatest amount of}} spores, (1. 70 g/ 100 g).

The problem is that the <b>high</b> <b>test</b> data volume leads to long test application times and <b>high</b> automatic <b>test</b> equipment memory requirement. For a modular core-based system-on-chip, a test data truncation scheme is proposed, that selects test data for each module {{in such a way that}} the system test quality is maximised while the selected test data are guaranteed to overcome constraints on time and memory. For test data selection, a test quality metric is defined based on fault coverage, defect probability and number of applied test vectors, and a scheme that selects the appropriate number of test vectors for each core, based on the test quality metric, defines the test architecture and schedules the transportation of the selected test data volume on the test access mechanism such that the system's test quality is maximised. The proposed technique has been implemented, and the experimental results, produced at reasonable CPU times on several ITC' 02 benchmarks, show that <b>high</b> <b>test</b> quality can be achieved by careful selection of test data.

40|$|The {{problem of}} gravel road {{dustiness}} is quite acute. In {{order to minimize}} harmful environmental components and to conduct dust reduction <b>tests,</b> <b>molasses</b> materials were chosen. Using the molasses materials {{of a new generation}} (solution Safecote) in the Lithuanian market, the obtained results of dustiness have reflected a reduction in particulate matter in the air. During the experiment, gravel road pavement was treated with different degrees of concentration (10 %, 20 %, 30 %) in solution “Safecote” at a driving speed of 30 km/h. Dustiness was measured at different distances from the road (0 m, 1 m, 2 m, 3 m). The undertaken study showed that the concentrations of particulate matter varied under changing weather conditions (air temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure). The statistical analysis of the received data has revealed that dustiness weakly correlates with temperature (correlation coefficient ranged from 0. 12 to 0. 67) moving from the road, the correlation coefficient of moisture is negative, a larger distance from the road increases inverse correlation (the correlation coefficient ranges from – 0. 02 to – 0. 85), negative correlation decreases moving from the road at a speed of the wind (from – 0. 72 to – 0. 06) and pressure correlation remains volatile (from – 0. 44 to 0. 44).  Article in Lithuanian  </p...|$|R
