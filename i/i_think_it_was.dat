5|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{really special}} to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together {{of a very}} specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They just get {{to see all the}} things that they hadn't seen that were going on behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E
5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E
25|$|I think Neal {{did a lot}} of {{marvelous}} {{things for}} us, because even though what he did was a different thing and not quite the style but sort of a different sound, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> quite musical.|$|E

"Think of <b>it?</b> Why, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> good. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> sense. <b>I</b> have {{no doubt}} that every year {{millions}} and millions of bushels of turnips are spoiled in this township alone by being pulled in a half-ripe condition, when, if they had sent a boy up to shake the tree--" ...|$|R

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just a {{reflection}} of the total anxiety and emotion of that period. There's {{a hell of a lot}} of spontaneity about that album. We went in with virtually nothing and everything just came pouring out.|$|E
25|$|I've {{always been}} fascinated with reality game shows but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my girlfriend's idea. We watch Celebrity Big Brother at the moment, we watch I'm a Celebrity, Get Me out of Here... we watch all those reality TV shows— The Office {{came out of}} those docu-soaps".|$|E
25|$|I don't {{know what}} Color Field {{painting}} means. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> probably invented by some critic, which is okay, but I don't think the phrase means anything. Color Field painting? I mean, what is color? Painting {{has to do}} with a lot of things. Color is among the things it {{has to do with}}. It has to do with surface. It has to do with shape, It has to do with feelings which are more difficult to get at.|$|E

25|$|If {{we accept}} {{the fact that they were}} above the Second Step, they would have seemed to be {{incredibly}} close to the summit of Everest and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> at that stage something takes hold of most climbers... And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> therefore taking all those circumstances in view... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> quite conceivable that they did go for the summit... I certainly would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a lovely thought and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> something, you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that is something one just cannot know.|$|R
25|$|Shooting 'Put It in a Love Song' in Rio, in Brazil, {{was very}} incredible, I {{feel that the}} energy of the city matches {{the energy of the}} song. It's sensual, it's exciting, it's so rich with color. I loved it. The people came out so heavy and so hard. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> exciting, {{especially}} to participate and experience it with them like that. Me and B have a good relationship. And {{to be able to have}} the chemistry we have and do it in a city that's so unique like that is unforgettable. The pictures speak a thousand words. So you saw the energy out there. It was great.|$|E
25|$|Clement Greenberg {{included}} {{the work of}} both Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland in a show that he did at the Kootz Gallery in the early 1950s. Clem {{was the first to}} see their potential. He invited them up to New York in 1953, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> to Helen's studio to see a painting that she had just done called Mountains and Sea, a very, very beautiful painting, which was in a sense, out of Pollock and out of Gorky. It also {{was one of the first}} stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one. Louis and Noland saw the picture unrolled on the floor of her studio and went back to Washington, DC., and worked together for a while, working at the implications of this kind of painting.|$|E
500|$|Rootes' design {{director}} Roy Axe commented {{later that}} [...] "The Alpine and Tiger were always oddballs in the [...] range.

500|$|Directing the scene, Kusama {{said it had}} {{a classic}} feel. Fox agreed, [...] "Yeah, and it {{projects}} whatever that material was. I'm not sure. It was pretty intense. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> worse for [...] because she's {{the one that got}} puked on. I was the one doing the puking." ...|$|E
500|$|Kubica {{said that}} his poor start was due to wheelspin off the line, and the {{presence}} of oil on the track impeded the performance of his car, leading to Räikkönen's pass: [...] "But anyway <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a good result: third and fourth for the team and leading the Constructors' Championship, so it was good weekend." ...|$|E

500|$|Yeah, we {{were kind}} of {{disappointed}} [...] because it sold really well. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just the timing because One Direction at the same time shot straight to number one with 'Little Things'. It's always hard to compete with the 1D lads. And we're chuffed to bits for them; we've always been supportive of them.|$|E
500|$|In a December 2012 interview, Winkelman {{expressed}} some regret {{about what}} had happened. [...] "I'm not {{proud of the way}} this club came to exist, and I am totally prepared to be the villain of the piece, but I can't put the genie back in the bottle," [...] he said. [...] "Do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> right? No. Do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a great thing that happened to Wimbledon? No... I don’t feel in the right over the way this club was born. But I don’t think I could live with myself if I hadn't gone out and bought the club when it was hours away from liquidation. It was about to be completely finito... What happened was my fault, and I have to take responsibility for it. But I don’t see why my players, staff and our young supporter base should be forced to carry the can and live with the nastiness, it's nothing to do with them." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{decided to}} forgo working with Butch Vig, who had {{produced}} the group's previous albums, and selected Flood and Alan Moulder as co-producers. Corgan explained, [...] "To be completely honest, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{a situation where}} we'd become so close to Butch that it started to work to our disadvantage... I just felt we had to force the situation, sonically, and take ourselves out of normal Pumpkin recording mode. I didn't want to repeat past Pumpkin work." ...|$|E

500|$|I got a call, {{they wanted}} me {{to be a part of}} that record. [...] It was {{actually}} the last day before Kanye had to turn the record in, and I think that pressure just made it that much more special to me. So I just sat there, approached the record openly and as straightforward as I could. When I laid the verse, 30 minutes later, I was extremely happy. I sent it to him, and he was too. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one of the dopest verses I did this year." ...|$|E
500|$|The Red River crested in Fargo at [...] on April 17, but dike-building {{efforts were}} able to prevent the water from {{flooding}} into {{a majority of the}} city. An emergency dike was built and volunteers had to add sandbags to increase the height of a dike that had settled. The mayor of Fargo at the time, Bruce Furness, later stated: [...] "We came very, very close to losing parts of Fargo...it took a lot of effort by a lot of people—a great many of them high school and college students—to save the city. I was very proud of them. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one of Fargo's finest moments." ...|$|E
500|$|Åkerman {{attended}} {{many different}} schools, including Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School in St. Catharines, Ontario. She once attended a Catholic school, {{though she was}} raised as a Buddhist. She has recalled some portions of her childhood as [...] "painful", explaining that [...] "I loved my father very much and I only got to see him during the school holidays. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an advantage that they split up when I was very young, so I could get used to it." [...] She visited her father in Falsterbo, Sweden, during school breaks and talked to him regularly over the phone. She cites her parents as [...] "supportive, positive influences" [...] in her life.|$|E
