The hip injury left Costello unable to wrestle, and The Fabulous Kangaroos split up once again. Costello had a full hip replacement and was forced to retire from active competition.|$|E

500|$|In 1975, {{comic book}} artist John Byrne was {{commissioned}} {{to create a}} series of books to coincide with broadcasts of the series. Published by Charlton Comics, it would also serve as Byrne's first series of comic books. After the first issue was distributed in May 1975, Hanna-Barbera asked Byrne to create a mellower second issue, as the debut was considered [...] "too scary" [...] by executives. The second issue discouraged Byrne from creating anymore books, so he ended the series with just two issues. Byrne also said he also felt wrong for accepting the {{large amounts of money}} from Hanna-Barbera, which he stated was <b>fifty</b> <b>dollars</b> per page. Despite this, further issues were created by artists other than Byrne. A total of seven issues were made, with the final one circulating in July 1976.|$|E

60|$|Before {{the advent}} of the American, the medium of {{exchange}} between the Indian and the white man was pelts. Afterward it was silver coin. If an Indian received in the sale of a horse a <b>fifty</b> <b>dollar</b> gold piece, not an infrequent occurrence, {{the first thing he did}} was to exchange it for American half dollars. These he could count. He would then commence his purchases, paying for each article separately, as he got it. He would not trust any one to add up the bill and pay it all at once. At that day <b>fifty</b> <b>dollar</b> gold pieces, not the issue of the government, were common on the Pacific coast. They were called slugs.|$|R

500|$|Throughout its history, the 1794 dollar has widely been {{considered}} one of the rarest and most valuable of all United States coins. In a September 1880 issue of The Coin Journal, the author noted that a good quality specimen of the 1794 dollar was valued at <b>fifty</b> <b>dollars.</b> In the early 1990s, numismatic historian Jack Collins estimated the surviving number of the coins to be between 120 and 130. In 2013, the finest known example, which was among the earliest coins struck and was prepared with special care, was sold at auction for $10,016,875, the highest selling price of any coin in history. The dollar was graded Specimen-66 by the Professional Coin Grading Service, noting the special conditions under which it was struck. The coin, which had previously been owned by Colonel E.H.R. Green, was sold by Stack's Bowers Galleries in a public auction in January 2013. It was previously sold in 2010 for what was then a record sum of $7.85 million, to the Cardinal Collection Educational Foundation. Steven Contursi, a former owner of the coin, said that it was a [...] "national treasure" [...] and that he was proud to have been its [...] "custodian" [...] from 2003 until its sale in 2010. Martin Logies, representative of the foundation that purchased the coin, said that of all the rarities he had seen, he believed that one was the [...] "single most important of all".|$|E

Following an exhibition game that Strom officiated between the Virginia Squires and Kentucky Colonels, he told a Philadelphia reporter that he had just seen the greatest player alive, referring to Julius Erving. While Erving was a very influential player in his era, the president of the Colonels, Mike Storen, complained that Strom was promoting players. The league fined Strom $50, but he sent $100 to Commissioner Jack Dolph saying, [...] "The first <b>fifty</b> <b>dollars</b> is for the fine and the second <b>fifty</b> <b>dollars</b> is because I'm tellin' ya' he is the greatest." ...|$|E
