5|$|Python 2.0 was {{released}} on 16 October 2000 and had many major new features, including a cycle-detecting <b>garbage</b> <b>collector</b> and support for Unicode. With this release the development process was changed and became more transparent and community-backed.|$|E

40|$|<b>Garbage</b> <b>collectors</b> areoccupationally {{exposed to}} a variety of {{airborne}} contaminants. The mainobjective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the respiratory health of garbagecollectors. This study was carried out in Fars Province, south of Iran. A groupof 105 <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors</b> and 93 referent subjects were investigated. Astandard questionnaire was administered to both groups. Furthermore, subjectsunderwent Pulmonary Function Tests. The data revealed that a few symptoms ofrespiratory disease were significantly more prevalent among <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors.</b> Likewise, significant decrements were observed in some parameters of pulmonaryfunction such as FEV 1 and FEV 1 /FVC ratio among <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors.</b> Theventilatory disorder found in spirometry of <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors</b> was consistentwith that of obstructive pulmonary disease. Our findings indicate that theprevalence of respiratory symptoms as well as impaired lung functionalcapacities were more common among <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors</b> than in their controlcounterparts. This is likely to be attributed to the occupational exposure ofthis group to workplace contaminants, particularly, bioaerosols...|$|R

50|$|Incremental and {{concurrent}} <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors</b> {{are designed}} to reduce this disruption by interleaving their work with activity from the main program. Incremental <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors</b> perform the <b>garbage</b> collection cycle in discrete phases, with program execution permitted between each phase (and sometimes during some phases). Concurrent <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors</b> do not stop program execution at all, except perhaps briefly when the program's execution stack is scanned. However, {{the sum of the}} incremental phases takes longer to complete than one batch garbage collection pass, so these <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors</b> may yield lower total throughput.|$|R
50|$|Latency is a debated {{point that}} has changed over time, with early <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors</b> and simple {{implementations}} performing very poorly compared to manual memory management, but sophisticated modern <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors</b> often performing as well or better than manual memory management.|$|R
5000|$|The {{frequent}} updates {{it involves}} {{are a source}} of inefficiency. While tracing <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors</b> can impact efficiency severely via context switching and cache line faults, they collect relatively infrequently, while accessing objects is done continually. Also, less importantly, reference counting requires every memory-managed object to reserve space for a reference count. In tracing <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors,</b> this information is stored implicitly in the references that refer to that object, saving space, although tracing <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors,</b> particularly incremental ones, can require additional space for other purposes.|$|R

25|$|Variables {{created for}} {{reference}} types are typed managed references. When the constructor is called, an object is created on the heap and a reference {{is assigned to}} the variable. When a variable of an object goes out of scope the reference is broken and {{when there are no}} references left the object gets marked as garbage. The <b>garbage</b> <b>collector</b> will then soon collect and destroy it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Modern {{embedded}} devices (e. g. PDAs, mobile phones) are now incorporating Java {{as a very}} popular implementation language in their designs. These new embedded systems include multiple complex applications (e. g. 3 D rendering applications) that are dynamically launched by the user, which can produce very energy-hungry systems {{if they are not}} properly designed. Therefore, it is crucial for new {{embedded devices}} {{a better understanding of the}} interactions between the applications and the <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors</b> to reduce their energy consumption and to extend their battery life. In this paper we present a complete study, from an energy viewpoint, of the different state-of-the-art <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors</b> mechanisms (e. g. mark-and-sweep, generational <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors)</b> for embedded systems. Our results show that traditional solutions of <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors</b> for Java-based systems do not seem to produce the lowest energy consumption solutions. ...|$|R
50|$|When a {{variable}} {{refers to a}} data structure created dynamically, some of its components may be only indirectly accessed through the variable. In such circumstances, <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors</b> (or analogous program features in languages that lack <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors)</b> must deal with a case where {{only a portion of}} the memory reachable from the variable needs to be reclaimed.|$|R

It follows a deaf <b>garbage</b> <b>collector</b> who is determined {{to learn how to}} surf after discovering a broken surfboard. Kitano's more delicate, romantic side came to the fore here, along with his trademark deadpan approach. The film garnered numerous nominations and awards, including Best Film at the prestigious Blue Ribbon Awards. It also started a long-running collaboration with composer Joe Hisaishi, which would last until 2002.|$|E

Most of the 500 municipal workers who have been killed in Baghdad since 2005 have been waste collectors. There are inadequate waste collection vehicles with only 380 presently in service. Before the invasion there were 1200 working trucks. Most of the vehicles were destroyed or lost in the looting that seized the capital after the American invasion. The deputy mayor of Baghdad estimates the city needs 1,500 waste collection vehicles.|$|E

For better security and stability, IE8 uses the Loosely Coupled Internet Explorer (LCIE) architecture and runs the browser frame and tabs in separate processes. LCIE prevents glitches and hangs from bringing down the entire browser and leads to higher performance and scalability. Permissions for ActiveX controls have been made more flexible instead of enabling or disabling them globally, they can now be allowed on a per-site basis.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims: Public {{cleansing}} workers, especially public <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors</b> {{are probably}} {{at risk for}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis A virus (HAV) infections. This {{study was designed to}} assess risky behaviors, occupational risk and seroprevalence of HBV and HAV infections in this group. Methods: 354 public cleansing workers of Bangkok Metropolis (185 cleaners and 169 <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors)</b> were randomly selected by multi-stage sampling. The subjects were interviewed and their blood pecimens were collected to investigate HBV seromarkers (HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc) and anti-HAV by voluntary participation. Results: Out of 354 workers, 22. 6 % had tattoos, 15. 8 % had a history of regular alcohol consumption, and 6. 8 % had a history of extramarital sex without using condoms in a previous year. Public <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors</b> had relatively higher percentage than public cleaners. Also, public <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors</b> had significantly higher percentage of occupational risks including a history of contact with blood, a history of contact with used condom, syringe or needle, and a history of needle stick or sharp puncture than public cleaners (P= 0. 0018, 0. 0067 & 0. 0012, respectively). Results from blood screening revealed 49. 4 % of HBV seropositivity, 5. 9 % of HBsAg, 37. 3 % of anti-HBs, 6. 2 % of anti-HBc only, and 85 % of anti-HAV antibody. Public <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors</b> had significantly higher HBV seropositivity than public cleaners (P= 0. 0058), while there was no statistical significance in anti-HAV positivity between groups. Risk factors for HBV seropositiveness after multivariate analysis were occupation (adjusted OR= 1. 76, P= 0. 0027), a history of contact with used condom, syringe or needle (adjusted OR= 3. 02, P< 0. 0001), and a history of needle stick or sharp puncture (adjusted OR= 4. 21, P< 0. 0001). Conclusions: This study supported public cleansing workers; especially public <b>garbage</b> <b>collectors</b> were at risk for HBV and/or HAV infections. The risk reduction programs including a 100 % condom use, life skills education, hygienic practice, use of safer equipment for collecting garbage, and HBV vaccination should be provided for this group...|$|R
