40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were: 1) to assess the need <b>for</b> {{parenting}} <b>support</b> of families with a toddler 2) to determine whether this need <b>for</b> <b>support</b> reflects family problems, and (3) to examine whether the presence of riskand protective factors predicts this need <b>for</b> parenting <b>support.</b> A substantial number of mothers in a community sample reported need <b>for</b> parenting <b>support.</b> This need <b>for</b> <b>support</b> was related with behavior problems {{of the child and}} with negative parenting behaviors. Maternal depressive mood, difficult child temperament and total number of risk factors predicted need <b>for</b> <b>support.</b> Satisfaction with social support (but not number of support sources) acted as a protective factor...|$|R
40|$|Second {{and third}} grade children's {{perceptions}} of available classroom peer {{social support and}} peer acceptance were investigated using sociometric nomination and rating procedures. Nomination items included giving, receiving, seeking, and friendship support. Reciprocal nominations were investigated by exploring matches between nominator and nominee <b>for</b> friendship or <b>support,</b> and expected reciprocity was investigated in terms of consistency of children's nominations across items. The relationship between peer acceptance, expected reciprocity, and reciprocity in social support were also examined. Results revealed that boys and girls rated their own gender higher in peer acceptance, and girl's ratings of girls increased across the school year. No gender {{differences were found in}} expectations <b>for</b> <b>support</b> or in reciprocal nominations <b>for</b> <b>support.</b> <b>For</b> all, the number of reciprocal nominations <b>for</b> <b>support</b> increased across the school year. Peer acceptance was related more to reciprocal nominations <b>for</b> <b>support</b> as opposed to expectations <b>for</b> <b>support.</b> Directions <b>for</b> future research are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Although Haynes was a prohibitionist, he was {{a critic}} of the Indiana Branch of the Ku Klux Klan, which was in the height of its power during the 1910s and 1920s. In letters to friends and fellow prohibitionists, he {{ridiculed}} the organization for using violent and illegal tactics to achieve prohibition, and accused them of hypocrisy <b>for</b> <b>supporting</b> many anti-prohibition Democratic politicians. Kokomo politics was dominated by the Klan during that period and it is unknown if Haynes spoke publicly against the organization.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} change {{at this time}} was that players were no longer required {{to be members of}} the Catholic Young Men's Society. Hibs are not seen today as being an Irish or Roman Catholic institution, {{as it was in the}} early years of its history. For instance, the Irish harp was only re-introduced to the club badge when it was last re-designed in 2000. This design reflects the three pillars of the club's identity: Ireland, Edinburgh (the castle) and Leith (the ship). Geography rather than religion is now seen as the primary reason <b>for</b> <b>supporting</b> Hibs, who draw most of their support from the north and east of Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|According to {{traditional}} gender roles in Malawi, men operate {{primarily in the}} formal work sector and are responsible <b>for</b> <b>supporting</b> their families through paid labor, whereas women, who are valued for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and care work; this gender-based division of labor decreases women's autonomy, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Even within the home, women often lack bargaining power because they have limited access to education, formal employment, and other resources that could give {{them a sense of}} financial and personal independence. Women who are able to work in the formal sector typically earn significantly less money than men, even when they are completing the same tasks, making {{it difficult for them to}} elevate their status.|$|E

5|$|At the League's Fourth Conference in May 1888, {{factional}} divisions {{became increasingly}} apparent between Morris' anti-parliamentary socialists, the parliamentary socialists, and the anarchists; the Bloomsbury Branch were expelled <b>for</b> <b>supporting</b> parliamentary action. Under {{the leadership of}} Charles Mowbray, the League's anarchist wing were growing and called on the League to embrace violent action in trying to overthrow the capitalist system. By autumn 1889 the anarchists {{had taken over the}} League's executive committee and Morris was stripped of the editorship of Commonweal in favour of the anarchist Frank Kitz. This alienated Morris from the League, which had also become a financial burden for him; he had been subsidising its activities with £500 a year, a very large sum of money at the time. By the autumn of 1890, Morris left the Socialist League, with his Hammersmith branch seceding to become the independent Hammersmith Socialist Society in November 1890.|$|E
5|$|Born in Moss Side, Manchester to {{politically}} active parents, Pankhurst was introduced {{at the age}} of 14 to the women's suffrage movement. On 18 December 1879, she married Richard Pankhurst, a barrister 24 years older than her, known <b>for</b> <b>supporting</b> women's rights to vote; they had five children over the next ten years. He supported her activities outside the home, and she founded and became involved with the Women's Franchise League, which advocated suffrage for both married and unmarried women. When that organisation broke apart, she tried to join the left-leaning Independent Labour Party through her friendship with socialist Keir Hardie but was initially refused membership by the local branch on account of her gender. While working as a Poor Law Guardian, she was shocked at the harsh conditions she encountered in Manchester's workhouses.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge's first speech favored {{allowing}} the Kentucky Colonization Society {{to use the}} House chamber; later, he advocated directing Congress to establish an African freedmen colony, and to meet the costs of transporting settlers there.

As a reward <b>for</b> <b>supporting</b> these projects, he presided over {{the approval of the}} Louisville and Bowling Green Railroad's charter and was appointed director of the asylum.|$|E
