60|$|Reflecting the Sun with a Mirror.--To {{attract the}} notice of a {{division}} of your party, five or even ten miles off, glitter a bit of looking-glass in the sun, throwing its flash towards where {{you expect them to}} be. It is quite astonishing at how great a distance the gleam of the glass will catch the sharp eyes of a bushman who has learnt to know what it is. It is now a common signal in the North American prairies. (Sullivan.) It should be recollected that a passing flash has far less briliancy than one that dwells for an appreciable time on the retina of the observer; therefore the signaller should do all he can to steady his aim. I find the steadiest way of holding the mirror is to rest the hand firmly against the forehead, and to keep the eyes continually fixed upon the same distant object. The glare of the sun that is reflected from each point of the surface of a mirror forms a cone of light whose vertical angle is constant, and equal to that subtended by the sun. Hence when a flash is sent to a distant place, the size of the mirror is of no appreciable importance in affecting the size of the area over which the flash is visible. That area is the section of the fasciculus of cones that proceed from each point of the mirror, which, in the case we have supposed, differs immaterially from the cone reflected from a single point. Hence, if a man watches the play of the flash from his mirror upon a very near object, it will appear to him of the shape and size of the mirror; but as he retreats from the object, the edges of the flash become rounded, and very soon the flash appears a perfect circle, of precisely the same apparent diameter as the disc of the sun: it will, in short, look just like a very faint sun. The signaller has to cause this disc of light to cover the person whose notice he wishes to attract. I will proceed to show how he can do so; but in the mean time it will be evident that a pretty careful aim is requisite, or he will fail in his object. The steadiness of his aim must be just twice as accurate, neither more nor less, as would suffice to point a rifle at the sun when it was sufficiently obscured by a cloud to bear being looked at: for the object of the aim is of the same apparent size, but a movement of a mirror causes the ray reflected from it to move through a <b>double</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural EngineeringKimberly W. KramerIn {{structural}} steel connection design, simple shear connections {{are one of}} the most common connection types utilized. The industry, especially from the side of the engineer, tends to lean toward using <b>Double</b> Clip <b>Angle</b> Connections as the default standard for simple shear connections. A <b>double</b> clip <b>angle</b> connection is a connection consisting of two angles transferring the shear forces from one member to the next either through bolts or welds. The design of <b>Double</b> Clip <b>Angle</b> Connections is efficient and the connections themselves are easy to fabricate. However, benefits to utilizing other types of shear connections exist. Many of these benefits are seen in the fabrication shop or during erection and construction. This is especially true of single shear plate or shear tab connections when applied to open structure design. Shear tab connections consist of a single plate that transfers the shear forces from one member to the next with bolts or with welds. The design of shear tab connections can be a more involved process than the design of <b>double</b> clip <b>angles.</b> Sometimes the shear plate or shear tab has to be longer than is typical. This is called an extended shear plate connection. These extended shear plates can bring other variables into the design that typically don’t occur with <b>Double</b> Clip <b>Angle</b> Connections such as bending of the plate or the need for multiple bolt columns. However, with proper planning and detailing, the benefits and savings experienced in the fabrication or construction phase may outweigh what can be seen as a more laborious design task. The purpose of this report is to identify the possible benefits achieved in using each of these connections, highlight the differences in the design approach for each, and use a study model to compare the outcome of using one connection over another in the design of a typical open structure. <b>Double</b> clip <b>angles</b> are typically the most efficient approach when speed of design and simplicity of fabrication are the desired outcomes. However, shear plate or shear tab connections have the potential to provide safer erection alternatives and materials savings if used in appropriate ways and with the right applications...|$|R

40|$|In {{earlier work}} we {{described}} {{procedures for the}} fabrication of High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) using nanoimprint lithography to produce T-shaped resist profiles for gate metallization. For reliable liftoff the T-gate process requires a clear undercut in resist, and this is intrinsically impossible with imprint lithography. In addition, the imprinting process resulted in fracture defects in the resist unless release was carried out at elevated temperatures. Both these problems required improvement. In this article we describe an improved method for obtaining metallized imprinted T-gates by creating resist undercut using a <b>double</b> <b>angled</b> evaporation. HEMTs with self-aligned gate structures were fabricated using this procedure.

In the inelastic range, although the elastic flexural-torsional buckling loads for some struts are less than the elastic flexural buckling loads, results show that the inelastic buckling loads of the struts are not at all influenced by nor related to the elastic flexural-torsional buckling loads. It is found that flexural buckling mode is the dominant failure mode for most of the strut shapes, except for single unequal angles and for tees and <b>double</b> <b>angles</b> whose radii of gyration ratios, rx/ry, are greater than 1 · 0.
