5|$|Tellurium is a silvery-white shiny solid. It has a {{density of}} 6.24 g/cm3, is brittle, {{and is the}} softest of the {{commonly}} recognised metalloids, being marginally harder than sulfur. Large pieces of tellurium are stable in air. The finely powdered form is oxidized by air {{in the presence of}} moisture. Tellurium reacts with boiling water, or when freshly precipitated even at 50°C, to give the dioxide and hydrogen: Te + 2 H2O → TeO2 + 2 H2. It reacts (to varying degrees) with nitric, sulfuric and hydrochloric acids to give compounds such as the sulfoxide TeSO3 or tellurous acid <b>H2TeO3,</b> the basic nitrate (Te2O4H)+(NO3)−, or the oxide sulfate Te2O3(SO4). It dissolves in boiling alkalis, to give the tellurite and telluride: 3 Te + 6 KOH = K2TeO3 + 2 K2Te + 3 H2O, a reaction that proceeds or is reversible with increasing or decreasing temperature.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{preparation is}} to dehydrate tellurous acid, <b>H2TeO3,</b> or to thermally decompose basic tellurium nitrate,Te2O4.HNO3 above 400 °C.|$|E
50|$|In {{slightly}} acidic conditions, hydrogen tellurite ion, , is prevalent; {{with more}} acidic conditions tellurous acid, <b>H2TeO3,</b> is prevalent. Only in basic conditions is tellurite formed.|$|E
50|$|Tellurous acid (<b>H2TeO3),</b> {{containing}} tellurium in its +4 oxidation state, {{is known}} but not well characterised. Hydrogen telluride is an unstable gas that forms hydrotelluric acid upon addition to water.|$|E
5000|$|Tellurous acid is an {{inorganic}} compound with the formula <b>H2TeO3.</b> It is the oxoacid of tellurium(IV). [...] The compound {{is not well}} characterized. An alternative way of writing its formula is (HO)2TeO. In principle, tellurous acid would form by treatment of tellurium dioxide with water, i.e. hydrolysis. The related conjugate base {{is well known in}} the form of several salts such as potassium acid tellurite, KHTeO3.|$|E
