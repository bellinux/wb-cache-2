25|$|If {{we accept}} {{the fact that they were}} above the Second Step, they would have seemed to be {{incredibly}} close to the summit of Everest and I think at that stage something takes hold of most climbers... And I think therefore taking all those circumstances in view... I think it is quite conceivable that they did go for the summit... <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. I think it is a lovely thought and I think it is something, you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, I think that is something one just cannot know.|$|E
500|$|The two men found much in common: Hitler {{spoke of}} Speer as a [...] "kindred spirit" [...] {{for whom he}} had always {{maintained}} [...] "the warmest human feelings". The young, ambitious architect was dazzled by his rapid rise and close proximity to Hitler, which guaranteed him a flood of commissions {{from the government and}} from the highest ranks of the Party. Speer testified at Nuremberg, [...] "I belonged to a circle which consisted of other artists and his personal staff. If Hitler had had any friends at all, <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> have been one of his close friends." ...|$|E
500|$|Lody {{stated that}} he had been sent to the UK [...] "to remain until the first [...] {{encounter}} had taken place between the two Powers, and to send accurate information as regards the actual losses of the British Fleet", as well as to observe what he could of Fleet movements off the coast. The court martial went into an in camera session while sensitive evidence was being heard. Lody claimed that he had asked in August to be erased from military service on the grounds of poor health and to be allowed to travel to the United States. This was refused, he went on, but a member of naval intelligence whom he had previously never met coaxed him into undertaking a mission in the UK on the condition that he could go to the US afterwards. Lody told the tribunal that he was not pressured but that [...] "I have never been a coward in my life and <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> not be a shirker", and that he had persisted with his mission because [...] "once a man has promised to do a thing he does it, that is the understanding." [...] His services were provided [...] "absolutely as an honour and free", while he had never intended to be a spy: [...] "I was pressed for secret service, but not as a spy– oh, no. If that would have been mentioned to me at Berlin I surely would have refused. The word in the sentence, I do not think it goes together." [...] He claimed that he had [...] "pledged my word of honour" [...] not to name his controller.|$|E
6000|$|... "These {{things are}} all tricks and nonsense," [...] she said. [...] "I don't {{want to know}} {{anything}} about them. And if they were true, <b>I</b> most <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> not want {{to know anything about}} them." ...|$|R

5000|$|By Sept. 1944, Speer was {{disillusioned with}} the war, the Nazi Party and Hitler himself. Yet, at his trial, Speer states, [...] "If Hitler had had any friends, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> {{have been one}} of his close friends." [...] Despite being {{one of the few people}} to stay close to Hitler until the end, he [...] "undercut" [...] Hitler's {{scorched}} earth policy to prevent the complete destruction of Germany and occupied territories.|$|R
2500|$|Dan Rather stated, [...] "if I {{knew then}} what I know now — I {{would not have}} gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> not have used the {{documents}} in question." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 20, CBS {{retracted}} the story. Rather stated, [...] "If I {{knew then}} what I know now, I {{would not have}} gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> not have used the documents in question." [...] The controversy {{has been referred to}} by some as [...] "Memogate" [...] and [...] "Rathergate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Martin {{himself said}} of his {{partnership}} with Bryson in May 2014: [...] "I think people must hate playing against him, because <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would.</b> I wouldn't want to mark him. People can't stay with him, he's got that much energy. From my point of view, he helps my game, because he takes people away and runs in behind. It {{makes it easier for}} me to play, because he's always there next to me." ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR MALLESON,--I'm nearly beside {{myself with}} a sudden rush of work on my return from abroad, and {{resumption}} of Oxford duties, and I simply cannot yet think over {{the business of the}} letters, the rather that <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> never <b>would</b> re-publish most of those clergymen's letters at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I {{have heard}} of it; but I wish you would not call that man my brother. He would not own me as such, and <b>I</b> most <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> not own him. As far as I can learn {{he is one of}} the most detestable human beings that ever existed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, friend, {{for your}} warning. It is well timed. If {{you had not}} spoken <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> have gone forth to-morrow unprepared." ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{choosing}} {{a career in}} chess, Duchamp said, [...] "If Bobby Fischer came to me for advice, <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> not discourage him—as if anyone could—but I would {{try to make it}} positively clear that he will never have any money from chess, live a monk-like existence and know more rejection than any artist ever has, struggling to be known and accepted." [...] Duchamp left a legacy to chess {{in the form of an}} enigmatic endgame problem he composed in 1943. The problem was included in the announcement for Julian Levi's gallery exhibition Through the Big End of the Opera Glass, printed on translucent paper with the faint inscription: [...] "White to play and win". Grandmasters and endgame specialists have since grappled with the problem, with most concluding that there is no solution.|$|E
2500|$|The {{authenticity}} of the documents was challenged within hours on Internet forums and blogs, with questions initially focused on alleged anachronisms in the documents' typography. [...] Content soon spread to the mass media. Although CBS and Rather defended the authenticity and usage of the documents for a two-week period, continued scrutiny from other news organizations and independent analysis of the documents obtained by USA Today and CBS raised questions about their validity {{and led to a}} public repudiation on September 20, 2004. Rather stated, [...] "if I knew then what I know now – I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> not have used the documents in question," [...] and CBS News President Andrew Heyward said, [...] "Based on what we now know, CBS News cannot prove that the documents are authentic, which is the only acceptable journalistic standard to justify using them in the report. We should not have used them. That was a mistake, which we deeply regret." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Belding, <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> {{prefer a}} conference with you right now," [...] {{interposed}} the elder Chase, cutting short Belding's strange speech.

6000|$|... "No," [...] agreed Frances, {{sitting down}} and {{beginning}} to peel apples. [...] "So there is no use in lamenting, or <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> sit down and cry, I feel so disappointed." ...|$|R
