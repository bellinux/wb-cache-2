An earlier attempt to obtain a quarterback failed when the team sent a future draft pick to the Saints for backup quarterback Larry Cipa, only to waive him when he failed his physical.

5|$|On {{the second}} day (April 29) of the 1981 NFL Draft, the New Orleans Saints {{selected}} Tyler with the first pick of the ninth round, 222nd overall.

One of his touchdowns was a meaningless three-yard run while the game was out of reach, a 49–7 blowout against the Chicago Cardinals on November 23. The next season Kindt rushed for 189 yards on 54 carries and two touchdowns, as the Bears acquired former <b>Heisman</b> <b>Trophy</b> <b>winner</b> Johnny Lujack and Bobby Layne to join Kindt, Luckman and McAfee in the backfield. A highlight of the season happened against the Detroit Lions on October 17 when he had a 66-yard run for a touchdown in a 28–0 Bears victory. After running for 118 yards on 41 carries, an average of 2.9 yards per carry during the 1949 season, Kindt contributions to the offense were limited despite Layne getting traded to the New York Yanks, Lujack being injured and both McAfee and Luckman retiring. In his final six seasons, he only carried the ball 16 times for 13 yards and no touchdowns.|$|E
