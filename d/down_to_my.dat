2500|$|The {{music in}} Orchid {{combines}} elements influenced by progressive rock and acoustics pieces of folk {{music to the}} black metal scream and the death metal growl, as well having clean vocals. It also contains influences from jazz and melodic passages played by a piano and acoustic guitars.
