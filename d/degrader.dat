[...] Organisms capable of growth on 2-pyridone as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy have been isolated {{by a number of}} researchers. [...] The most extensively studied 2-pyridone <b>degrader</b> is the gram positive bacterium Arthrobacter crystallopoietes, a member of the phylum Actinobacteria which includes numerous related organisms that have been shown to degrade pyridine or one or more alkyl-, carboxyl-, or hydroxyl-substituted pyridines. [...] 2-Pyridone degradation is commonly initiated by mono-oxygenase attack, resulting in a diol, such as 2,5-dihydroxypyridine, which is metabolized via the maleamate pathway. [...] Fission of the ring proceeds via action of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine monooxygenase, which is also involved in metabolism of nicotinic acid via the maleamate pathway. [...] In the case of Arthrobacter crystallopoietes, {{at least part of the}} degradative pathway is plasmid-borne. [...] Pyridine diols undergo chemical transformation in solution to form intensely colored pigments. [...] Similar pigments have been observed in quinoline degradation, also owing to transformation of metabolites, however the yellow pigments often reported in degradation of many pyridine solvents, such as unsubstituted pyridine or picoline, generally result from overproduction of riboflavin in the presence of these solvents. [...] Generally speaking, degradation of pyridones, dihydroxypyridines, and pyridinecarboxylic acids is commonly mediated by oxygenases, whereas degradation of pyridine solvents often is not, and may in some cases involve an initial reductive step.|$|E

In the present study, stable-isotope probing (SIP) was applied to investigate <b>degraders</b> of PAHs in a forest soil {{with the addition of}} individually 13 C-labeled phenanthrene, anthracene, and fluoranthene. Three distinct phylotypes were identified as the active phenanthrene-, anthracene- and fluoranthene-degrading bacteria.

Two soil bacteria known to act as aromatic <b>degraders,</b> Pseudomonas putida and Rhodococcus sp.

To demonstrate the major <b>degraders</b> {{of petroleum}} hydrocarbons spilt in actual tropical seas, indigenous bacterial community in seawater at Sentosa (close to a port) and East Coast Park (far from a port) in Singapore was analyzed. Bacterial species was more diverse at Sentosa {{than at the}} Park, and the composition was different: c-Proteobacteria (57. 3 %) dominated at Sentosa, while they did not at the Park. Specialized hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (SHCB), which use limited carbon sources with a preference for petroleum hydrocarbons, were found as abundant species at Sentosa, indicating petroleum contamination. On the other hand, SHCB were not the abundant species at the Park.

To understand these interactions better, we used RNA-based stable-isotope probing to study the diversity of active atrazine-degrading bacteria in relation to atrazine degradation and to explore the impact of earthworm-soil engineering {{with respect to this}} relationship. Bulk soil, burrow linings and earthworm casts were incubated with 13 C-atrazine. The pollutant degradation was quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for 8 days, whereas active atrazine <b>degraders</b> were identified at 2 and 8 days by sequencing the 16 S ribosomal RNA in the 13 C-RNA fractions from the three soil microsites. An original diversity of atrazine <b>degraders</b> was found. Earthworm soil engineering greatly modified the taxonomic composition of atrazine <b>degraders</b> with dominance of a-, b- and c-proteobacteria in burrow linings and of Actinobacteria in casts. Earthworm soil bioturbation increased the c-diversity of atrazine <b>degraders</b> over the soil microsites generated. Atrazine degradation was enhanced in burrow linings in which primary atrazine <b>degraders,</b> closely related to Pelomonas aquatica, were detected only 2 days after atrazine addition. Atrazine degradation efficiency was not linearly related to the species richness of <b>degraders</b> but likely relied on keystone species. By enhancing soil heterogeneity, earthworms sustained high phylogenetic bacterial diversity and exerted a biotic control on the bacterial diversity-function relationships.

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of a {{purified}} rhamnolipid biosurfactant on the hydrophobicity of octadecane-degrading cells was investigated to determine whether differences in rates of octadecane biodegradation resulting from the addition of rhamnolipid to four strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa could be related to measured differences in hydrophobicity. Cell hydrophobicity was determined by a modified bacterial adherence to hydrocarbon (BATH) assay. Bacterial adherence to hydrocarbon quantitates the preference of cell surfaces for the aqueous phase or the aqueous-hexadecane interface in a two-phase system of water and hexadecane. On the basis of octadecane biodegradation in the absence of rhamnolipid, the four bacterial strains were divided into two groups: the fast <b>degraders</b> (ATCC 15442 and ATCC 27853), which had high cell hydrophobicities (74 and 55 % adherence to hexadecane, respectively), and the slow <b>degraders</b> (ATCC 9027 and NRRL 3198), which had low cell hydrophobicities (27 and 40 %, respectively). Although in all cases rhamnolipid increased the aqueous dispersion of octadecane at least 10 (4) -fold, at low rhamnolipid concentrations (0. 6 mM), biodegradation by all four strains was initially inhibited for at least 100 h relative to controls. At high rhamnolipid concentrations (6 mM), biodegradation by the fast <b>degraders</b> was slightly inhibited relative to controls, but the biodegradation by the slow <b>degraders</b> was enhanced relative to controls. Measurement of cell hydrophobicity showed that rhamnolipids increased the cell hydrophobicity of the slow <b>degraders</b> but had no effect on the cell hydrophobicity of the fast <b>degraders.</b> The rate at which the cells became hydrophobic was found to depend on the rhamnolipid concentration and was directly related to the rate of octadecane biodegradation.
