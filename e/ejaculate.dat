5|$|Men with SCI {{rank the}} ability to father {{children}} among their highest concerns relating to sexuality. Male fertility is reduced after SCI, due {{to a combination of}} problems with erections, ejaculation, and quality of the semen. As with other types of sexual response, ejaculation can be psychogenic or reflexogenic, and the level of injury affects a man's ability to experience each type. As many as 95% of men with SCI have problems with ejaculation (anejaculation), possibly due to impaired coordination of input from different parts of the nervous system. Erection, orgasm, and ejaculation can each occur independently, although {{the ability to}} <b>ejaculate</b> seems linked {{to the quality of the}} erection, and the ability to orgasm is linked to the ejaculation facility. Even men with complete injuries may be able to <b>ejaculate,</b> because other nerves involved in ejaculation can effect the response without input from the spinal cord. In general, the higher the level of injury, the more physical stimulation the man needs to <b>ejaculate.</b> Conversely, premature or spontaneous ejaculation can be a problem for men with injuries at levels T12–L1. It can be severe enough that ejaculation is provoked by thinking a sexual thought, or for no reason at all, and is not accompanied by orgasm.|$|E

Phaeacius spins a flimsy silken, horizontal or vertical platform, about twice the spider's length in diameter, to moult and lay eggs, but not at other times. After the moult, Phaeacius leaves the discarded exuvia hanging from the platform. A female's egg sac is placed in a shallow cavity {{on the surface of}} a log.|$|E

The gods take the bull's hide and <b>ejaculate</b> or urinate into it and bury it in the earth, then tell him to dig it up ten months later. When he does, he finds Orion; this explains why Orion is earthborn.|$|E

Initial post-thaw total and progressive motilitics and daily post-thaw total and progressive motilities, {{as well as the}} number of days to reach 0 progressively motile spermatozoa, were also similar for the 2 methods of collection. The percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa both before freezin and after thawing were also similar for in copula and ex copula <b>ejaculates.</b> Consistent wit h previous work (1 l), imipramine-induced <b>ejaculates</b> were of extremely high sperm concentration and low volume compared with those of in copula <b>ejaculates.</b> In this study, imipramine-induced <b>ejaculates</b> were of significantly higher concentration of sperm and lower volume than fractionated (first 2 - 3 jets) in copula <b>ejaculates.</b> These results suggest that imipramine-induced <b>ejaculates</b> may be suitable for cryoprescrvation.

The results showed {{that there was no}} significantly different (P > 0. 05) quality of <b>ejaculated</b> and epididymal sperms. The motility percentage of post thawing epididymal and <b>ejaculated</b> sperms was 41 - 46 % and 41 - 45 %, respectively. And percentage of cytoplasmic membrane integrity of the post thawing epididymal and <b>ejaculated</b> sperms was 66 - 67 % and 47 - 54 % respectively. There was also no significant different (P > 0. 05) in the percentage of cytoplasmic membrane integrity between the extenders of both <b>ejaculated</b> and epididymal sperms.

40|$|Two <b>ejaculates</b> were {{harvested}} by electroejaculation {{on each of}} 3 d {{per week}} for 14 wk from 14, 12 - to 24 -mo-old Holstein bulls. <b>Ejaculates</b> during the first 2 wk served to stabilize sperm output. Data for the remaining <b>ejaculates</b> were used in a components of variance approach {{to determine the number}} of bulls per treatment and <b>ejaculates</b> per bull that would be needed to provide adequate sensitivity and precision for assessing treatment effects on seminal characteristics. The latter included the number of sperm (total and motile), volume and sperm concentrations of the sperm-rich fraction, and the percentage of progressively motile sperm in first and second <b>ejaculates</b> or per day. Replication requirements declined as the number of <b>ejaculates</b> per bull was increased to about 15 to 25 but declined minimally thereafter. The number of bulls needed per treatment varied in relation {{to the size of the}} treatment response to be detected but was much greater than the replication used in typical experiments. Replication for assessing sperm output in first <b>ejaculates</b> or per day was approximately one-half as great for experiments in which pretreatment information was used to adjust post-treatment data.

5|$|In the book, Mason Verger runs an orphanage, {{from which}} he calls {{children}} to verbally abuse {{as a substitute for}} his no longer being able to molest them. He also has a sister, Margot, whom he had raped when they were children and who is a lesbian. When she disclosed her sexual orientation to her family, their father disowned her. As she is sterile due to steroid abuse, Verger exerts some control over her by promising her a semen sample with which to impregnate her lover, who could then inherit the Verger fortune. Also, in the novel, Verger literally has no face and has to be kept in a sterile room at all times to keep bacteria from affecting exposed muscle and tissues. At the book's end, Margot and Starling both help Lecter escape during a shootout between Starling and Verger's guards. Margot, at Lecter's advice, stimulates her brother to <b>ejaculate</b> with a rectally inserted cattle prod, and then kills him by ramming his pet Moray eel down his throat.|$|E
5|$|It {{has long}} been {{believed}} that a male black-throated blue warbler achieves reproductive maturation well into its first breeding season. A yearling participates in extra-pair mating and cuckoldry as much as or even more than older males. However, research by Graves has found opposing evidence in terms of testicular size and sperm production. Directional asymmetry is present in many passerine birds. The left testicle is often larger in size than the right one, and this holds true for both yearling and older male warblers. However, the testicle to body mass ratio nonetheless is much lower in yearlings than in older males. Moreover, older males have {{a greater degree of}} directional asymmetry than do yearlings. Because the size of testes in birds is correlated to the <b>ejaculate</b> quality, it is likely that females employ age-dependent choice in favor of older males who can be distinguished by their definitive age-specific plumage.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to fi nd some important differences between the levels of these components and the total sperm motility after freezing and thawing (freezability of the semen). Total of 32 <b>ejaculates</b> from 7 stallions were collected, assessed and prepared in 0, 5 ml straws for freezing. After thawing, the sperm motility was analyzed and <b>ejaculates</b> were divided into two groups: “good” freezable and “poor” freezable. The only statistically significant difference between groups of „good“ and „poor“ freezable <b>ejaculates</b> was in the concentration of vitamin E in the seminal plasma.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare <b>ejaculates</b> of Duroc and Pietrain boars in terms of sperm {{morphology}} characteristics. Analysis was performed on 116 <b>ejaculates</b> collected from 6 Duroc boars and 9 Pietrain boars. The boars selected for examination were young and at the beginning of their reproductive utilization. <b>Ejaculates</b> were collected at monthly intervals over the period of 10 months. Microscopic slides were prepared immediately after collection of <b>ejaculates.</b> The slides were examined to assess the frequency of morphological abnormalities. Moreover, morphometric measurements were taken from 15 randomly selected morphologically normal spermatozoa. Also, conventional evaluation of <b>ejaculates</b> was made following methods used at Polish sow insemination centres. Differences were found in the dimensions and shape between Duroc and Pietrain spermatozoa. Pietrain spermatozoa were characterised by significantly smaller head perimeter compared with Duroc (P ≤ 0. 01). Moreover, Pietrain spermatozoa tails were by 0. 8 μm longer (P ≤ 0. 01), and their total sperm length was greater by 0. 5 μm compared to Duroc (P ≤ 0. 05) sperm. The volume of Duroc <b>ejaculates</b> was lower but their sperm concentration was greater. The results of the present study contribute to scientific progress as they demonstrat...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to examine the}} influence of animal age, season and captivity status on seminal quality in wild-born cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) in Namibia, Africa. Animals were divided into three age categories: juvenile (14 - 24 months; n= 16 males, 23 ejaculates); adult (25 - 120 months; n= 76 males, 172 ejaculates); and aged (> 120 months; n= 5 males, 5 <b>ejaculates).</b> Seasons were categorised into hot-wet (January-April), cold-dry (May-August) and hot-dry (September-December). A comparison between freshly wild-caught (n= 29 males, 41 <b>ejaculates)</b> and captive-held cheetahs (n= 68 males, 159 <b>ejaculates)</b> was also conducted. Raw <b>ejaculates</b> contained 69. 0 ± 1. 1 % motile spermatozoa (mean±s. e. m.) with 73. 6 ± 1. 5 % of these cells containing an intact acrosome. Overall, 18. 4 ± 0. 9 % of spermatozoa were morphologically normal, with midpiece anomalies being the most prevalent (¡« 39 %) defect. Juvenile cheetahs produced <b>ejaculates</b> with poorer spermmotility, forward progressive status, lower seminal volume and fewer total motile spermatozoa than adult and aged animals. Spermatogenesis continued unabated throughout the year and was minimally influenced by season. Proportions of sperm malformations were also not affected by season. <b>Ejaculates</b> from captive cheetahs had increased volume and intact acrosomes, but lower sperm density than wild-caught counterparts.

25|$|In organisms, sexual {{selection}} extends past differential reproduction to affect sperm composition, sperm competition, and <b>ejaculate</b> size. Males of C. lectularius allocate 12% of their sperm and 19% of their seminal fluid per mating. Due to these findings, Reinhard et. al proposed that multiple mating {{is limited by}} seminal fluid and not sperm. After measuring <b>ejaculate</b> volume, mating rate and estimating sperm density, Reinhardt et al. showed that mating could be limited by seminal fluid. Despite these advances, the cost difference between ejaculate-dose dependence and mating frequency dependence have not been explored.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{predictor of}} male fitness is the fertilizing efficiency of their <b>ejaculates.</b> <b>Ejaculates</b> are costly {{to produce and}} males are predicted to devote greater resources to copulations with reproductively superior females. It is well established that males allocate different numbers of sperm to <b>ejaculates.</b> However, less is known about how males adjust their sperm quality, which {{has important implications for}} our understanding of fertilization and the evolution of sexual strategies. Here we test in the fowl, Gallus gallus, whether males adjust their sperm velocity by differentially allocating seminal fluid to copulations with attractive and unattractive females. To disentangle the contributions of sperm and seminal fluid to sperm velocity, we separated and remixed sperm and seminal fluid from <b>ejaculates</b> allocated to females of different attractiveness. We show that dominant males increase the velocity of the sperm they invest in more attractive females by allocating larger <b>ejaculates</b> that contain seminal fluid that increases sperm velocity. Furthermore, we find weak evidence that males also allocate sperm with higher velocity, irrespective of seminal fluid, to more attractive females...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the claim that rabbit eggs penetrated by epididymal spermatozoa have a higher embryonic mortality than those fertilized by <b>ejaculated</b> spermatozoa. Spermatozoa from the lower corpus epididymidis inseminated into the uterus fertilized 76. 5 percent of 204 ova in comparison with 75. 9 percent of 199 ova fertilized by <b>ejaculated</b> spermatozoa of the same males inseminated into the contralateral uterine horn. Twenty-seven hours after insemination and HCG injection the 4 cell stage was reached by 11. 4 percent of ova fertilized by lower corpus sperm vs. 17. 4 percent fertilized by <b>ejaculated</b> sperm. When transferred to contralateral oviducts of synchronized recipients 60. 3 percent of 63 ova fertilized by lower corpus sperm implanted and 50. 8 percent developed normally to term, compared with 57. 1 percent and 47. 6 percent respectively for those fertilized by <b>ejaculated</b> spermatozoa.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the topographical distribution of seminal plasma (SP) proteins on epididymal and <b>ejaculated</b> bovine sperm. Using immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy the binding patterns of bovine SP proteins BSP-A 3, albumin, transferrin, prostaglandin D-synthase (PGDS) and nucleobindin in <b>ejaculated</b> and cauda epididymal sperm from adult bulls were evaluated. Experiments were performed using sperm from 5 males. Data showed a positive signal, only detected for anti-PGDS, in the acrosomal cap of epididymal and <b>ejaculated</b> sperm. In <b>ejaculated</b> sperm, a very weak signal for nucleobindin 2 in the midpiece and equatorial regions was detected, using the anti-rat nucleobindin. BSP-A 3 was detected on all sperm regions studied, with a more evidenced signal in acrosome and midpiece. However, no binding was detected for albumin or transferrin in neither epididymal nor <b>ejaculated</b> sperm. In conclusion, PGDS, BSP-A 3 and nucleobindin interact directly with bovine sperm, with specific topographic distribution. These findings may add to the knowledge of how these proteins modulate sperm functions, thus providing fundamental support for studies designed to evaluate how they influence sperm functions...|$|R
40|$|The mouse is an {{established}} and popular animal model for studying reproductive biology. Epididymal mouse sperm, which lack exposure to secretions of male accessory glands {{and do not}} precisely represent <b>ejaculated</b> sperm {{for the study of}} sperm functions, have been almost exclusively used in studies. We compared <b>ejaculated</b> and epididymal sperm in an in vitro fertilization setting to examine whether <b>ejaculated</b> sperm enter cumulus-oocyte complexes more efficiently. In order to prepare sperm for fertilization, they were incubated under capacitating conditions. At the outset of incubation, <b>ejaculated</b> sperm stuck to the glass surfaces of slides and the incidences of sticking decreased with time; whereas, very few epididymal sperm stuck to glass at any time point, indicating differences in surface charge. At the end of the capacitating incubation, when sperm were added to cumulus-oocyte complexes, the form of flagellar movement differed dramatically; specifically, <b>ejaculated</b> sperm predominantly exhibited increased bending {{on one side of the}} flagellum (a process termed pro-hook hyperactivation), while epididymal sperm equally exhibited increased bending on one or the other side of the flagellum (pro-hook or anti-hook hyperactivation). This indicates that accessory sex gland secretions might have modified Ca 2 + signaling activities in sperm, because the two forms of hyperactivation are reported to be triggered by different Ca 2 + signaling patterns. Lastly, over time, more <b>ejaculated</b> than epididymal sperm entered the cumulus oocyte complexes. We concluded that modification of sperm by male accessory gland secretions affects the behavior of <b>ejaculated</b> sperm, possibly providing them with an advantage over epididymal sperm for reaching the eggs in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} pregnancy and miscarriage rates following {{intracytoplasmic sperm injection}} (ICSI) cycles using retrieved epididymal and testicular sperm in azoospermic men and <b>ejaculated</b> sperm in oligospermic and normospermic men. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was carried out on 517 couples who underwent ICSI. They included 96 couples with azoospermia and 421 with oligospermia or normal sperm count in the male partner. Of the men with azoospermia, 69 underwent percutaneous epididymal aspiration (PESA) and 47 underwent testicular sperm extraction (TESE). In the 421 men with oligospermia or normal sperm count, <b>ejaculated</b> sperm was used for ICSI. The differences in the outcomes of ICSI using PESA or TESE and <b>ejaculated</b> sperm were evaluated. The main outcome measures were pregnancy and miscarriage rates. Results: No significant differences were seen in pregnancy and miscarriage rates with surgically retrieved and <b>ejaculated</b> sperm. The pregnancy rates (including frozen embryo transfer) were 43. 5 %, 36. 2 %, and 41. 4 % in couples with PESA, TESE, and <b>ejaculated</b> sperm, respectively (P =. 93). The miscarriage rates were 16. 7 %, 23. 5 %, and 12. 1 %, respectively (P =. 37). Conclusion: Intracytoplasmic sperm injection in combination with PESA and TESE is an effective method and can successfully be performed to treat men with azoospermia.

25|$|The {{effect of}} mating on female fitness may vary {{depending}} upon the kind of benefit that the females receive from males through of their choices. Direct benefits include nutritional resources {{to be used by}} females, donation of foods to mates, males offering prey to the female, seen in scorpion flies and dance flies. Several orthopteran species, butterflies, flies, and beetle males can donate secretions or nutritional substances to the females which are transferred in the <b>ejaculate</b> or produced by male glands which can contribute to increase female fecundity. In the green-veined white (Pieris napi), a virgin male can transfer an <b>ejaculate</b> containing 14% nitrogen by dry mass. Females utilize the nutrients transferred from the male in order to increase their nutrients. These nutrients essentially contribute to ensure successful egg production. A positive relationship between the amount of <b>ejaculate</b> material received and lifetime reproductive output, as male-transferred material increases female longevity. Male-transferred material also increases female longevity. In some insect species, males can donate some body parts to females such as the leg spurs or the fleshy hindwings of jumped-winged crickets, or they may be completely cannibalized, as occurs in mantis and some dipterous, as well as in some Arachnida scorpions and spider species.|$|E
