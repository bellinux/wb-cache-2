5|$|After a long siege, Andi Guru and Tiku's former {{lieutenant}} Tandi Bunna'– both by {{then working}} for the Dutch– approached Tiku on 26 October and offered a cease fire. Although initially unwilling, Tiku was reportedly convinced by civilians who reminded him that his mother– {{who had died in}} the siege– needed to be buried. After three days of peaceful <b>intermingling,</b> on the night of 30 October the Dutch forces took over the fortress, appropriated all weapons, and captured Tiku. He and his soldiers were forced to go to Tondon.|$|E
5|$|Predynastic Egypt {{originally}} {{consisted of}} small, independent villages. Because many deities in later times were {{strongly tied to}} particular towns and regions, many scholars {{have suggested that the}} pantheon formed as disparate communities coalesced into larger states, spreading and <b>intermingling</b> the worship of the old local deities. But others have argued that the most important predynastic gods were, like other elements of Egyptian culture, present all across the country despite the political divisions within it.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} threat to manta rays is overfishing. M. birostris is not evenly distributed over the oceans, but is concentrated in areas that provide the food resources it requires, while M. alfredi is even more localized. Their distributions are thus fragmented, with little evidence of <b>intermingling</b> of subpopulations. Because of their long lifespans and low reproductive rate, overfishing can severely reduce local populations with little likelihood that individuals from elsewhere will replace them.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well-known}} {{that it is}} possible to construct a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism on the 3 -torus in a similar way than in Kan's example. It has two hyperbolic physical measures with <b>intermingled</b> basins supported on two embedded tori with Anosov dynamics. A natural question is how robust is the <b>intermingled</b> basins phenomenon for diffeomorphisms defined on boundaryless manifolds? In this work we will show that on the 3 -torus the only partially hyperbolic examples having hyperbolic physical measures with <b>intermingled</b> basins are not robust...|$|R

5|$|A Paleolithic culture around 30,000BC {{constitutes}} {{the first known}} habitation of the Japanese archipelago. This was followed from around 14,000BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture, including by ancestors of contemporary Ainu people and Yamato people. Decorated clay vessels from this period {{are some of the}} oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world. Around 300 BC, the Yayoi people began to enter the Japanese islands, <b>intermingling</b> with the Jōmon. The Yayoi period, starting around 500BC, saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming, a new style of pottery and metallurgy, introduced from China and Korea.|$|E

Exley tells Dales that he was forbidden from <b>intermingling</b> with the human race but {{fell in love with}} the game of baseball and remained on Earth. Meanwhile, the Alien Bounty Hunter, who has been pursuing the renegade alien ever since he deserted his alien heritage, takes Exley's form and murders a scientist who is investigating the green ooze that Dales found. After learning of the attack, Dales warns Exley that he is now wanted by the police, and Exley goes into hiding.|$|E
5|$|Letting bean dip {{sit for a}} {{while before}} serving can {{increase}} the <b>intermingling</b> of flavors in the dish. Bean dip can be served cold, at room temperature, or as a hot dish. Hot bean dip can be prepared ahead of time, refrigerated and then cooked at a later time, and can also be prepared using a slow cooker and served in the appliance. Bean dip can be prepared as a vegan and gluten-free dish. The dish is typically served with tortilla chips, and can also be served with crackers, crudités, breadsticks, pita bread and toasted bread such as baguette.|$|E

5|$|The Mérens {{may be of}} Iberian origin, as {{are most}} breeds from {{the area of the}} Pyrenees. It resembles the Norwegian Dole Gudbrandsdal and the British Fell and Dales ponies. Unlike the latter, the Mérens has never been crossed with the Friesian horse. Another theory of origin for the Mérens is based on the {{straight}} or concave facial profile (which distinguishes them from the convex-profiled Iberian horses), and asserts that they are descended from Oriental horses brought to Ariege by settlers from the east. With the isolation of their mountain homeland, the Mérens has undergone very little <b>intermingling</b> with foreign breeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleolus}} is {{a discrete}} densely stained structure {{found in the}} nucleus. It is not surrounded by a membrane, and is sometimes called a suborganelle. It forms around tandem repeats of rDNA, DNA coding for ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These regions are called nucleolar organizer regions (NOR). The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and assemble ribosomes. The structural cohesion of the nucleolus depends on its activity, as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association. This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in <b>intermingling</b> of nucleolar structures.|$|E

Again, Nao decided to set off the bombs during {{the early hours of}} May 2, so that he and his fellow operative could escape safely and avoid inflicting casualties on the local population. But due to illness, Cay declined {{to take part in the}} operation, so Hung had to replace him. At around 9am on May 1, Nao rushed to Hung’s home, where the latter was given a hand grenade and was notified of an upcoming operation without much detail. At 6pm, after Nao had finished unloading the bombs onto one canoe, he and Hung traveled down the Saigon River in two separate canoes, towards the commercial port district. Both men than pulled over in the Thu Thiem area, to avoid detection from South Vietnamese authorities by <b>intermingling</b> with the local workers who lived there. While waiting for the right time, Nao briefed Hung on the objectives of the operation, which was to sink the largest American ship at the Saigon Port, and promptly report the results back to headquarters.|$|E
