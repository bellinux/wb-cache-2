50|$|A backhoe, {{also called}} a rear actor or back actor, {{is a piece}} of {{excavating}} equipment or digger consisting of a <b>digging</b> <b>bucket</b> {{on the end of a}} two-part articulated arm. They are typically mounted on the back of a tractor or front loader, the latter forming a 'backhoe loader' (colloquially known as a JCB in Ireland and UK). The section of the arm closest to the vehicle is known as the boom, and the section which carries the bucket is known as the dipper or dipper-stick, terms derived from steam shovels). The boom is generally attached to the vehicle through a pivot known as the king-post, which allows the arm to pivot left and right, usually through a total of around 180-200 degrees.|$|E

50|$|White {{cast iron}} {{displays}} white fractured surfaces {{due to the}} presence of an iron carbide precipitate called cementite. With a lower silicon content (graphitizing agent) and faster cooling rate, the carbon in white cast iron precipitates out of the melt as the metastable phase cementite, Fe3C, rather than graphite. The cementite which precipitates from the melt forms as relatively large particles. As the iron carbide precipitates out, it withdraws carbon from the original melt, moving the mixture toward one that is closer to eutectic, and the remaining phase is the lower iron-carbon austenite (which on cooling might transform to martensite). These eutectic carbides are much too large to provide the benefit of what is called precipitation hardening (as in some steels, where much smaller cementite precipitates might inhibit plastic deformation by impeding the movement of dislocations through the pure iron ferrite matrix). Rather, they increase the bulk hardness of the cast iron simply by virtue of their own very high hardness and their substantial volume fraction, such that the bulk hardness can be approximated by a rule of mixtures. In any case, they offer hardness at the expense of toughness. Since carbide makes up a large fraction of the material, white cast iron could reasonably be classified as a cermet. White iron is too brittle for use in many structural components, but with good hardness and abrasion resistance and relatively low cost, it finds use in such applications as the wear surfaces (impeller and volute) of slurry pumps, shell liners and lifter bars in ball mills and autogenous grinding mills, balls and rings in coal pulverisers, and the teeth of a backhoe's <b>digging</b> <b>bucket</b> (although cast medium-carbon martensitic steel is more common for this application).|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} slender beam-like {{structures}} subjected to axial load and frictional constraints (for example, undercarriage legs, <b>digging</b> <b>buckets,</b> blades of turbines, brushes and wiper systems) exhibits a complex dynamic behavior. The main components {{of these systems}} are often constrained to slide on a surface with friction. Here we present a dynamical model where a flexible beam is spring-hinged at one end, while the opposite end can slide with coulombian friction on a rigid surface moving with prescribed velocity. The beam is subjected to a concentrated compressive load at the top end. The equations of motion are solved analytically as a combination of free-modes shapes and elastically deformed axis’ line shapes. Once refined, the proposed model could constitute a design tool useful {{in many of the}} above-described applicative contexts. One of the first results is that the frequency of the alternation between the stick and the slip phase may be sensibly different from the natural frequencies of the system...|$|R

50|$|The {{internal}} mechanics {{were not}} very sophisticated—they duplicated, on a larger scale, many of the devices used by placer mining throughout the gold rush, such as the gold pan and the sluice box. In essence, the dirt that was dug by the large electrically powered buckets was sifted and sorted, and the remainder was washed over a series of riffles allowing the gold to settle and be trapped. The primary advantages that made the dredge more efficient than other methods were the volume of earth it could process and having its own water supply. The dredge that was built in Sumpter Valley could <b>dig</b> over 20 <b>buckets</b> per minute, consuming more than seven yards of earth each minute.|$|R
40|$|Autonomous {{excavation}} {{has attracted}} interest {{because of the}} potential for increased productivity and lower labor costs. This research concerns the problem of automating a hydraulic excavator for mass excavation, where tons of earth are excavated and loaded into trucks. This application is commonly found in many construction and mining scenarios. In such applications, fast operational speed of these machines is desired, because it directly translates to increased productivity. A hydraulic excavator can be considered a large, four degree-of-freedom manipulator mounted on a tracked base. The bucket {{at the end of the}} manipulator is used for digging and depositing the excavated material into the trucks. A core technology required for automation is the motion planning of the excavator’s manipulator. This research focuses on planning the free motion of the excavator, which begins after <b>digging</b> a <b>bucket</b> of material, and ends after the material has been deposited and the bucket has been returned to the digging area. The goal is to plan the excavator’s motions such that autonomous task performance approaches that of a highly skilled human expert operator working in similar conditions. Much of the prior research in autonomous excavation has focused on digging and related topic...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} tackle global warming or climate change, Sanitary Landfill {{is one of}} the waste {{processing}} technology that is environmentally friendly, reliable and considered the most effective because it can reduce air pollution that cause global warming. In addition this technology can also be designed and operated as a landfill-based methane gas capture. In the methane gas capture systems are used to the vertical extraction system that is by making the water - gas pipe vertical wells and installed HDPE pipe and permeability of the media with pebbles. Installation of vertical extraction system is still hampered by the limited drilling equipment / mechanical excavation can implemented on the 20 m-deep midden and 60 - 80 cm in diameter. In the process of manual excavation using shovels and trowels can only take place three days were the workers can only survive as long as 15 minutes due to the stinging smell of gas and respiratory disturb the workers. Then performed by using a drill wells to continue to dig there but this also caused problems in dig deeper solid waste so that it becomes difficult for proficiency level in these excavations, then sought another solution is found using the excavator to dig the well.

40|$|In robotic excavation, hybrid position/force {{control has}} been {{proposed}} for <b>bucket</b> <b>digging</b> trajectory following. In hybrid position/force control, the control mode is required to switch between position- and force-control {{depending on whether the}} bucket is in free space or in contact with the soil during the process. Alternatively, impedance control can be applied such that one control mode is employed in both free and constrained motion. This paper presents a robust sliding controller that implements impedance control for a backhoe excavator. The control law consists of three components: an equivalent control, a switching control and a tuning control. Given an excavation task in world space, inverse kinematic and dynamic models are used to convert the task into a desired digging trajectory in joint space. The proposed controller is applied to provide good tracking performance with attenuated vibration at bucket-soil contact points. From the control signals and the joint angles of the excavator, the piston position and ram force of each hydraulic cylinder for the axis control of the boom, arm, and bucket can be determined. The problem is then how to find the control voltage applied to each servovalve to achieve force and position tracking of each electrohydraulic system for the axis motion of the boom, arm, and bucket. With an observer-based compensation for disturbance force including hydraulic friction, tracking of the piston ram force and position is guaranteed using robust sliding control. High performance and strong robustness can be obtained as demonstrated by simulation and experiments performed on a hydraulically actuated robotic excavator. The results obtained suggest that the proposed control technique can provide robust performance when employed in autonomous excavation with soil contact considerations. ...|$|R
