25|$|John Henry Knight (1847–1917), {{who built}} the first British motor car and {{designed}} a number of innovative <b>digging</b> <b>machines</b> for use in hop fields, was born and brought up at Weybourne {{on the outskirts of}} the town.|$|R
5000|$|In 1872 Knight {{developed}} a steam powered Hops <b>digging</b> <b>machine.</b> A rival designer, Frank Proctor, stated in an 1890 {{edition of the}} weekly magazine [...] "Engineering" [...] that [...] "Mr Knight has undoubtedly earned {{the distinction of being}} one of the early pioneers in the system of steam digging". He had begun developing his first <b>digging</b> <b>machine</b> in 1872, specifically for working in hopfields, which are difficult to cultivate due to the incidence of the hop poles which support the strings up which the plants climb. [...] "Digging by Steam" [...] by Colin Tyler (published in 1977 by Argus Books Ltd) devotes a chapter to hop digging machines, many of which were designed and built by Knight, and which are illustrated with drawings or photos.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{function}} of BWEs is {{to act as}} a continuous <b>digging</b> <b>machine</b> in large-scale open-pit mining operations. What sets BWEs apart from other large-scale mining equipment, such as bucket chain excavators, is their use of a large wheel consisting of a continuous pattern of buckets used to scoop material as the wheel turns. They are among the largest vehicles ever constructed, and the biggest bucket-wheel excavator ever built, Bagger 293, is the largest terrestrial (land) vehicle in human history by weight (14,200 tonnes), according to the Guinness Book of World Records.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the ensuing}} decades, P&H earth moving {{machines}} evolved into larger, {{more powerful and}} more productive prime movers of material. By 1930, welding technology made possible the fabrication of lighter, stronger machinery versus traditional riveted-design machinery. P&H not only was an early adapter to welded design, but the firm also designed and manufactured its own line of electric arc welding machinery and welding rod products. Another technology advance applied to P&H <b>digging</b> <b>machines</b> during the 1930s was the Ward-Leonard DC electric motor drive system. Pawling & Harnischfeger began designing and making their own electric motors and controls starting in 1893 when they acquired assets of the Gibb Electric Company that were not needed when Gibb was purchased by Westinghouse Electric Manufacturing Company.|$|R

The game also introduces mineral smelting, which allows the creation of a number of alloys by collecting minerals in certain sequences. The introduction of a number of optional puzzles, solvable via the use of bombs, is also new to Super Motherload.|$|E
25|$|Despite being a noted {{criminal}} on Earth, Luthor is revered on {{the alien}} world of Lexor, where he rediscovered the planet's lost technology and rebuilt society for its inhabitants. He apparently lost {{a fight to}} Superman so that water could be transported to the desert planet, as he had reactivated <b>digging</b> <b>machines</b> but discovered {{he could not find}} water. He and Superman had originally gone to the world to have a proper fight as Superman did not want to appear cowardly after Luthor over a radio challenged him to a fight, as this planet had a red sun meaning Superman lost his powers there. As a result, he becomes a hero in the eyes of Lexor's people, whereas Superman is detested as a villain. He eventually marries a local woman named Ardora,.

30|$|Despite the {{implementation}} of the 811 One-Call System that requires excavation contractors to call the state One-Call center that in turn, informs utility owners to mark utility locations with spray paint or flags, excavation remains the single largest cause of pipeline accidents. For instance, a UNCC (Utility Notification Center of Colorado (UNCC) 2005) study reported that 55.7 % of the 9, 371 incidents in Colorado in 2005 occurred even though the excavators followed the One-Call procedure. These incidents occur due to two primary reasons: (1) reliable data regarding the true location of underground utilities is missing or incomplete, i.e., utilities are often NOT at locations where the records specify (Sterling et al. 2009); and (2) uncertainty in the utility location is not communicated to excavator operators in real-time to help them objectively perceive the <b>digging</b> <b>machine’s</b> position relative to the buried utilities (Sterling et al. 2009;CGER - Commission on Geosciences, Environment and Resources Environment and Resources 2000).|$|R

50|$|Increased EPA {{scrutiny}} and a rapid drop {{in demand for}} high sulfur coal following {{the passage of the}} 1977 Clean Air Act, coupled with regular yearly increases in electricity costs and continued public opposition to strip mining operations in Ohio eventually made Big Muskie unprofitable to operate, and it was removed from service in 1991. Attempts to sell the machine to another coal company found little interest due to the massive costs involved in dismantling, transporting and reassembling the machine. Additionally, by 1991 the few US coal companies still practicing open-pit mining had transitioned to smaller, newer, and cheaper <b>digging</b> <b>machines</b> with much lower operating costs. The only remaining large-scale open-pit brown coal operations that might have been suitable for Big Muskie's design were located at the Garzweiler mine in Germany, where more efficient giant bucket wheel excavators—the largest of which could remove more than twice the overburden of Big Muskie per day, and with lower power consumption—had long since made giant draglines obsolete.|$|R

40|$|The {{world is}} deep: and deeper than day has ever comprehended. "~Nietzsche, Thus Spoke ZarathustraFor too long, the Earth {{has been used}} to ground thought instead of bending it; such {{grounding}} leaves the planet as nothing but a stage for phenomenology, deconstruction, or other forms of anthropocentric philosophy. In far too much continental philosophy, the Earth is a cold, dead place enlivened only by human thought—either as a thing to be exploited, or as an object of nostalgia. Geophilosophy seeks instead to question the ground of thinking itself, the relation of the inorganic to the capacities and limits of thought. This book constructs an eclectic variant of geophilosophy through engagements with <b>digging</b> <b>machines,</b> nuclear waste, cyclones and volcanoes, giant worms, secret vessels, decay, subterranean cities, hell, demon souls, black suns, and xenoarcheaology, via continental theory (Nietzsche, Schelling, Deleuze, et alia) and various cultural objects such as horror films, videogames, and weird Lovecraftian fictions, with special attention to Speculative Realism and the work of Reza Negarestani. In a time where the earth as a whole is threatened by ecological collapse, On an Ungrounded Earth generates a perversely realist account of the earth as a dynamic engine materially invading and upsetting our attempts to reduce it to merely the ground beneath our feet...|$|R
