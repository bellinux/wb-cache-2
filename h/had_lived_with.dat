5|$|Anne Whittle (Chattox) {{was accused}} {{of the murder of}} Robert Nutter. She pleaded not guilty, but the {{confession}} she had made to Roger Nowell was read out in court, and evidence against her was presented by James Robinson, who <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> the Chattox family 20 years earlier. He claimed to remember that Nutter had accused Chattox of turning his beer sour, and that she was commonly believed to be a witch. Chattox broke down and admitted her guilt, calling on God for forgiveness and the judges to be merciful to her daughter, Anne Redferne.|$|E

5|$|For example, {{near the}} mouth of the Yangtze, the baiji was a princess that had lost her parents and <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> her step-father, whom she had longed to get away from. The step-father wanted to trade her since she would have been sold for a great sum of money, but as they were {{crossing}} the river to get to the trader, a storm rolled in, and they were drenched. The step-father, enraged, tried to take her, but she plunged herself into the river. Before being drowned in the river, she was transformed into a dolphin, and swam away from her abusive step-father, who also fell in and was transformed into a porpoise.|$|E
5|$|Here {{came the}} Rabbi, his back bent, his face shaved... His mere {{presence}} among the deportees added {{a touch of}} unreality to the scene. It was like a page torn from some story book... One by one they passed in front of me, teachers, friends, others, all those I had been afraid of, all those I once could have laughed at, all those I <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> over the years. They went by, fallen, dragging their packs, dragging their lives, deserting their homes, the years of their childhood, cringing like beaten dogs.|$|E
5|$|Paul Kelly {{stayed with}} Don Walker (Cold Chisel) in Kings Cross – Walker <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> Hilary's sister – and wrote new songs on Walker's piano. Kelly then {{moved into a}} flat with Paul Hewson (Dragon) in Elizabeth Bay. Both Walker and Hewson {{encouraged}} Kelly to continue with his song-writing. By January 1985, he recorded the self-funded album—at a cost of $3,500—Post. Session musicians included Michael Barclay (Weddings Parties Anything) on harmonies, guitarist Steve Connolly (The Zimmermen), and bass guitarist Ian Rilen (Rose Tattoo, X). They spent two weeks recording at Clive Shakespeare's studio. Shakespeare engineered the album and co-produced with Kelly. It was released in May 1985 on the independent label White Records, and licensed to Mushroom Records.|$|E

5|$|The Godwins were {{constantly}} in debt, so Godwin returned to writing {{to support the}} family. He and his wife started a Juvenile Library for which he wrote children's books. In 1807, when Fanny was 13, they moved from the Polygon, where Godwin <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> Wollstonecraft, to 41 Skinner Street, near Clerkenwell, in the city's bookselling district. This took the family away from the fresh country air and into the dirty, smelly, inner streets of London. Although initially successful, the business gradually failed. The Godwins also continued to borrow more money than they could afford from generous friends such as publisher Joseph Johnson and Godwin devotee Francis Place.|$|E
5|$|The IRA {{notified}} the McCann, Savage, and Farrell {{families of the}} deaths {{on the evening of}} 6 March. In Belfast, Joe Austin, a senior local member of Sinn Féin, was assigned the task of recovering the bodies for burial. On 9 March, he and Terence Farrell (one of Mairéad Farrell's brothers) travelled to Gibraltar to identify the bodies. Austin negotiated a charter aircraft to collect the corpses from Gibraltar and fly them to Dublin on 14 March. In 2017 it emerged that Charles Haughey had secretly requested that the Royal Air Force fly the bodies direct to Belfast, bypassing the Republic of which he was Taoiseach. Two thousand people waited to meet the coffins in Dublin, which were then driven north to Belfast. Northern Irish authorities flooded the neighbourhoods where McCann, Farrell and Savage <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> soldiers and police to try to prevent public displays of sympathy for the dead. Later that evening, a local IRA member, Kevin McCracken, was shot and allegedly then beaten to death by a group of soldiers he had been attempting to shoot at. At the border, the authorities met the procession with a large number of police and military vehicles, and insisted on intervals between the hearses, causing tensions between the police {{and the members of the}} procession and leading to accusations that the police rammed Savage's hearse.|$|E
5|$|Up to 1990, Nicaragua <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> {{forty years}} of the Somoza dictatorship, through a decade of civil warfare and Sandinista rule, and five years of US imposed {{economic}} sanctions. On 25 February 1990, Chamorro won the election with a 54.7% share of the vote, ousting the incumbent Ortega and becoming the first elected woman president in the Americas. Because the election {{was held in the}} midst of a civil war, it was important both domestically and internationally that the vote was seen to be legitimate. The Esquipulas Peace Agreement which had been brokered by Arias, called for monitoring of elections by the Organization of American States and the United Nations, among other provisions. The election was the most strictly monitored of any in Latin America and involved 2,578 international observers among them former US President Jimmy Carter; Raul Alfonsín, former President of Argentina; Alfonso López Michelsen, former President of Colombia; Rodrigo Carazo Odio, former President of Costa Rica and many Caribbean and US dignitaries. Ortega and his supporters conceded defeat without argument and observers left only a skeleton staff to assist with the transition of power.|$|E
