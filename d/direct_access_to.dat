5|$|In June 2015, the Airport Drive {{extension}} was completed, {{creating a}} second major {{link to the}} airport. The link starts at the M80 Western Ring Road and provides <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Melrose Drive 1.5 kilometres from the terminal area.|$|E
5|$|A {{narrow slit}} {{along the north}} wall's outside surface {{indicates}} {{the presence of an}} ancient balcony. There are several rooms attached {{to the rear of the}} structure that lack <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the main building; these are believed to have been dedicated to community storage. Chetro Ketl and Pueblo Bonito are the only two great houses in Chaco Canyon with corner doorways.|$|E
5|$|Heinz Field {{is located}} at Exit 1B of Interstate 279 {{within a mile of}} <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> both Interstate 376 and Interstate 579.

Buses depart from Level 0 of Terminal 1 and Level 2 of Terminal 3.|$|E
5|$|TfL {{has also}} {{suggested}} {{there may be}} potential for the turnback siding adjacent to Milkwood Road to be converted for passenger use. This would require substantial changes to the station {{as there is no}} <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the platforms from Milkwood Road and the current subway for accessing the platforms does not extend east of the southbound platform.|$|E
5|$|The {{completed}} project {{resulted in}} the creation of Highway427 between the QEW and Dixon / Airport Road, north of which traffic was defaulted onto Indian Line. The entire Airport Expressway was removed {{to make way for the}} new interchange, but the new route still included <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the airport.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of a single root view is that processes may be run on any available node and access needed files with no special precautions. If the cluster implements process migration a single root view enables <b>direct</b> <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> the files from the node where the process is currently running.|$|R

5|$|Australia and New Zealand {{were built}} with a {{different}} arrangement. The spotting top on the main mast was deleted and an armoured spotting tower was built instead into the conning tower where it was better protected, had an improved field of vision and <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the primary conning position. The rear Transmitting Station was also deleted and the forward TS was consequently enlarged. Their 'A' turrets were built with the improvements listed above.|$|E
5|$|Surrounded by hills, Lam Tin {{does not}} have <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the Victoria Harbour. However, {{merchant}} ships and ferries dock at Kwun Tong Pier and Lei Yue Mun Pier, which are both within 15 minutes' walk from Lam Tin, and provide surface transport for Lam Tin residents. Another reason for Lam Tin's absence of an outlet to the Harbour {{is the presence of}} an Eastern Harbour Crossing entrance inside the district, whose buses and MTR overtook ferries for cross-harbour transport.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{proposed}} by the North London Railway (NLR). The line originally opened as the East & West India Docks & Birmingham Junction Railway in 1850, in order to transport freight between the London and Birmingham Railway and the London Docklands. By the time it had been renamed to the NLR in 1853, passenger traffic had grown in equal importance, so {{it was decided to}} build a station with <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the City.|$|E

5|$|Through the mid-2000s, EVA Air's {{route network}} was {{affected}} by the political status of Taiwan, which has historically limited access for Taiwanese airlines to Europe and certain Asian countries. Because Taiwanese carriers did not have <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> China, EVA Air has used Hong Kong, Bangkok and Macau as interline destinations. EVA Air operated regular charter flights to China in 2008. The airline began regularly scheduled, direct cross-strait operations in December 2008, following the restoration of direct travel links.|$|E
5|$|Vascular {{cells are}} known to play a {{prominent}} role in regulating proliferation of adult neural precursors. In the adult subgranular zone (SGZ), dense clusters of dividing cells were found to be anatomically close to the vasculature, especially capillaries. Contacts between adult SVZ neuronal precursors and blood vessels are unusually permeable and frequently devoid of astrocyte and pericyte interferences, suggesting that blood-derived cues are gaining <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> adult neural precursors and their progeny. The vasculature also provides the substrate for new neuron migration after injury in the adult striatum.|$|E
5|$|While {{allowing}} for easy travel across the city, the E.C. Row Expressway does not {{connect to the}} United States yet; drivers can access the Ambassador Bridge via Huron Church Road, or the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel via Dougall Parkway, which also provides the most <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Highway401. This situation will change as the expressway western terminus {{is located at the}} port of entry for the Gordie Howe International Bridge scheduled for completion in 2020.|$|E

5|$|All ground {{stations}} {{are connected to}} KSAT's Tromsø Network Operation Center, which is also connected to the TSS and TrollSat. This allows for redundancy as also TSS and TrollSat {{can be used to}} communicate with the satellites. Some customers have <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> their installations in Longyearbyen without having to route via the Tromsø Network Operation Center. The operation center is responsible for backup, scheduling and conflict resolution. The facility uses interoperability and shared ground services, such as a common protocol for communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk.|$|E
5|$|All {{the roads}} in Miri are {{maintained}} by Miri City Council (MCC). Miri is accessible by road from Bandar Seri Begawan (Brunei) through the Sungai Tujoh checkpoint {{which is located}} 35km north of Miri. Miri is connected to all major cities and towns in Sarawak including Kota Kinabalu in Sabah through the Pan Borneo Highway. Miri is also connected to Bintulu town through a coastal road and Marudi through a 42km road. ASEAN Bridge is located along the Miri-Baram Highway and crosses the Baram River, providing <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> neighbouring country of Brunei, and the towns of Limbang and Lawas in Sarawak.|$|E
5|$|At Altoona, {{the route}} again {{overlaps}} I-80 until Newton, where it splits away from I-80. The highway passes near {{or through the}} cities of Kellogg, Grinnell, Victor, Marengo, the Amana Colonies, and Tiffin before entering the Coralville / Iowa City area. Through Coralville and Iowa City, US6 has no <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> I-80, I-380, or US218; other routes like Iowa Highway 1 (Iowa1) and Iowa965 provide direct access. From Iowa City, the highway heads to the east-southeast through West Liberty and Atalissa. Near Wilton, the route heads north to I-80 where it again overlaps to Davenport. At Davenport, US6 then follows I-280 and US61 before entering the city. On {{the eastern side of}} Davenport, it joins I-74 and enters Bettendorf before leaving Iowa for Illinois.|$|E

5|$|Elephant & Castle {{is located}} in the Elephant and Castle area of Newington in the London Borough of Southwark in central London. The station is in both Travelcard Zones 1 and 2 and is on the Bank branch of the Northern line between Kennington and Borough stations, and is the {{southern}} terminus of the Bakerloo line, the next station being Lambeth North. The station has two surface buildings, separated by a large traffic intersection. The northern building provides the most <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the Bakerloo line, while the southern one is linked more directly to the Northern line.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, King Leopold II and Great Britain {{signed the}} 1894 Anglo-Congolese treaty, which {{resulted}} in the exchange of a long strip of land on {{the eastern side of the}} Congo for the Lado Enclave, leased to King Leopold II for the duration of his reign. This aided the British in pursuing the Cape to Cairo railway, as well as preventing the French from achieving an east-west line by putting the Belgians in their path. With the Lado Enclave, King Leopold gained <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Rejaf, the last outpost on the navigable Nile. Although the outbreak of the Mahdist War (1881–1899) had disrupted trade up and down the Nile river, Leopold hoped to gain Rejaf in preparation for its reopening once the Mahdist threat had been addressed.|$|E
5|$|In March 1942, the Military Board was {{abolished}} and General Sir Thomas Blamey {{was appointed}} Commander in Chief. Blamey decided {{that after the}} hectic events of the previous months, Sturdee needed a rest and appointed him as Head of the Australian Military Mission to Washington, D.C., where the war's strategy was now being decided. Sturdee accepted on condition that after a year's duty in Washington he would be appointed to an important command. In Washington, Sturdee represented Australia before the Combined Chiefs of Staff and managed to obtain the right of <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George Marshall. For his services as Chief of the General Staff, Sturdee was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1943.|$|E
