40|$|Thermally <b>actuated</b> <b>hydraulic</b> pumps {{have been}} {{proposed}} for diverse applications in which direct electrical or mechanical actuation is undesirable and the relative slowness of thermal actuation can be tolerated. The proposed pumps would not contain any sliding (wearing) parts in their compressors and, hence, could have long operational lifetimes. The basic principle of a pump according to the proposal is to utilize the {{thermal expansion and contraction}} of a wax or other phase-change material in contact with a hydraulic fluid in a rigid chamber. Heating the chamber and its contents from below to above the melting temperature of the phase-change material would cause the material to expand significantly, thus causing a substantial increase in hydraulic pressure and/or a substantial displacement of hydraulic fluid out of the chamber. Similarly, cooling the chamber and its contents from above to below the melting temperature of the phase-change material would cause the material to contract significantly, thus causing a substantial decrease in hydraulic pressure and/or a substantial displacement of hydraulic fluid into the chamber. The displacement of the hydraulic fluid could be used to drive a piston. The figure illustrates a simple example of a hydraulic jack driven by a thermally <b>actuated</b> <b>hydraulic</b> pump. The pump chamber would be a cylinder containing encapsulated wax pellets and containing radial fins to facilitate transfer of heat to and from the wax. The plastic encapsulation would serve as an oil/wax barrier and the remaining interior space could be filled with hydraulic oil. A filter would retain the encapsulated wax particles in the pump chamber while allowing the hydraulic oil to flow {{into and out of the}} chamber. In one important class of potential applications, thermally <b>actuated</b> <b>hydraulic</b> pumps, exploiting vertical ocean temperature gradients for heating and cooling as needed, would be used to vary hydraulic pressures to control buoyancy in undersea research vessels. Heretofore, electrically <b>actuated</b> <b>hydraulic</b> pumps have been used for this purpose.

In addressing these issues, our research proposes and experimentally demonstrates a control technique that renders a hydraulic machine (teleoperated backhoe in this case) as a two-port, coordinated, passive machine. The passive teleoperated backhoe is driven by a human operator at one-port and interacts with the environment at the other. It guarantees interaction stability and safety with the human / work environment as the latter are usually passive. In previous work, a passive teleoperation algorithm was proposed for multi degree of freedom teleoperation of a hydraulic backhoe approximated by its kinematic behavior. The approximation led to severe performance deterioration under certain operating conditions. In this paper, a bondgraph based passive teleoperation architecture is proposed for the nonlinear dynamic modeled backhoe. Passive control is designed in two stages.
