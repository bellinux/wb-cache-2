5|$|According to the {{practice}} of cursing and sorcery peculiar to Sinhala Buddhists, Kataragama deviyo has <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> side represented by Getabaru and Kadavara. The current Getabaru shrine is located in an isolated place near Morawaka. The shrine for Kadavara is in the town of Kataragama. His power to curse is carried out in secret outside the Main Kataragama deviyo shrine at a place at the Menik Ganga, where he receives animal sacrifices. Katagama devio is also directly invoked in sorcery practices.|$|E

5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture of {{the figure in the}} background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> hair all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E
5|$|After Ashtar escapes {{into the}} Maze of Darkness, Robert tells Ryu about Ashtar's plot {{to take over}} the world by using the full power of his sword, the Dark Sword of Chaos. Robert implores Ryu to stop Ashtar before <b>his</b> <b>Dark</b> Sword reaches full power. After battling through the Maze of Darkness and into the World of Chaos, Ryu hears echoes of Ashtar's plan in the distance. Ryu then catches up with Ashtar. He {{releases}} Irene, but immediately after releasing her he stabs her with the Dark Sword. Robert then shows up, only to find out that Irene has been mortally wounded; Ashtar then blasts Robert with energy from <b>his</b> <b>Dark</b> Sword and then challenges Ryu to battle. Ryu defeats Ashtar, and before he dies, he says that the forces of Darkness will soon awaken and implores the forces of Chaos to engulf the world into darkness. While he is saying this, the Dark Sword of Chaos vanishes into thin air. After Ashtar's death, Irene tells Ryu that an evil altar that Ashtar prepared to open the Gate of Darkness must be destroyed. Ryu then leaves Irene behind and tells Robert to take her and leave the World of Chaos.|$|E

5|$|After {{the player}} completes {{the game with}} either the bad ending or the best ending, Julius Mode is unlocked, similar to the Julius Mode in Aria of Sorrow. Julius Mode, in storyline terms, follows the {{assumption}} that Soma succumbed to <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> power, and became the new dark lord. A new game can then be started {{from the main menu}} in Julius Mode. In Julius Mode, the playable characters include Julius Belmont, Yoko Belnades, and Alucard. Each character has a weapon and an assortment of abilities unique to them, and although these abilities remain static throughout the entire game, the characters' statistics can improve by acquiring enough experience points to level up. The castle layout and enemies are the same, {{with the exception of the}} final battle, which is against Soma.|$|E

It was awarded the 2005 Eisner Award for Best Anthology and a pair of Harvey Awards for Best Anthology and Best New Series.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{production}} was tumultuous. Chettiar opposed casting Rajinikanth as the protagonist because of <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> skin and typecasting as a villain at the time, but Mahendran refused {{to direct the}} film without the actor and Chettiar capitulated. Since Mahendran had no previous directing experience, cinematographer Balu Mahendra (a director himself) assisted Mahendran with the screenplay, dialogue, camera angles, casting and editing. The film significantly deviates from the novel, with Mahendran having read {{only a part of}} it. Filming lasted for roughly 30 days, and primarily took place in Sringeri. Chettiar was surprised that the finished film had less dialogue than visuals, which he did not expect from Mahendran.|$|E
5|$|A {{man with}} a tattooed tree {{on his chest and}} back is {{introduced}} in the opening minutes of Carnivàles pilot episode, and appears in many other Avataric visions and dreams: in Ben's and Brother Justin's common recurring dreams chasing Henry Scudder in a cornfield, in Ben's microsleep-like visions, in Sofie's visions of the rape of her mother, and in an extended vision of Brother Justin foreshadowing <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> future. Ben encounters a little boy with a similar tree painted to his chest and back late in Season 1. Brother Justin finds this tree grown on a hill early in Season 2, which prompts him to get his chest and back tattooed accordingly. The tree is also depicted in the show's Gospel of Matthias book, in a painting at the Templar Hall in Loving, New Mexico, and on many images in the room of Templar chaplain Kerrigan. Management and Wilfred Talbot Smith imply the tree's significance for the resolution of Carnivàle.|$|E
5|$|During the menstrual {{period of}} the older queen, Ambika, Satyavati invited Vyasa to Ambika's bedchamber. However, during sex with Vyasa, Ambika noticed <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> {{appearance}} and closed her eyes. Vyasa declared to Satyavti that due to Ambika's cruelty, her son would be blind (but strong) and have a hundred sons – later known as Kauravas (descendants of Kuru). Satyavati considered such an heir to be an unworthy king, so she asked Vyasa to have niyoga with her other daughter-in-law. During their niyoga, Ambalika fell pale due to Vyasa's grim appearance. As the result the child would be wan, Vyasa told his mother, who begged for another child. In due course, the blind Dhritarashtra and the pale Pandu were born. Satyavati again invited Vyasa to Ambika's bedchamber; she remembered Vyasa's grim appearance (and repulsive odour), and substituted a Shudra (lowest caste) maid in her place. The maid respected the sage and was not afraid of him, and Vyasa thus blessed her; her son {{would be the most}} intelligent man, and she would no longer be a slave. Vyasa told Satyavti of the deception, and then disappeared; Vidura, an incarnation of the god Dharma, was born to the maid.|$|E

5|$|Sora makes a minor {{appearance}} in Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, {{the majority of}} which is set as he sleeps to recover his lost memories from the events of Chain of Memories; it is also established that Xion, an experimental replica of Sora created by the Organization, inadvertently hinders the restoration process until she joins with him. In Kingdom Hearts Coded, Sora appears in the final scene, in which he receives King Mickey's letter and reads it with Riku and Kairi. A computer program created from Sora's data serves as the primary protagonist of the game, finding out the truth behind a mysterious message found inside Jiminy's journal. A young Sora and Riku briefly appear in Destiny Islands in the prequel, Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep. After Ventus, one of the protagonists, has his heart damaged following a confrontation with <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> side, Vanitas, his heart finds its way into Sora, entering the boy's body. In the game's secret ending, set after the events of Kingdom Hearts II, Ansem the Wise tells Aqua about Sora's adventures, and how he may help all the people connected to him. In the final scene, Sora decides to save them after reading Mickey's letter.|$|E
5|$|The Ancient Minister's true {{identity}} {{is found to}} be that of the Master R.O.B. unit, who rebels against Ganondorf to join the allied characters. The three major groups that had formed over the storyline then all converge in one area, and use the Halberd to battle Ganondorf and Bowser's subspace gunship. Although they destroy the Halberd, all of the characters make it out unscathed in smaller vehicles. Unable to hit so many targets, Ganondorf and Bowser retreat into subspace after Kirby destroys the gunship with his dragoon. An enraged Ganondorf turns Bowser into a trophy with <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> cannon, and he learns that Master Hand was being manipulated by the chains of the actual Subspace Army leader, known only as Tabuu. Ganondorf jumps up and does the attack on Tabuu who easily defeats him, Ganondorf collides with Master Hand, thus breaking free from the chains and turning Ganondorf into his trophy. Master Hand attempts to attack Tabuu, but to no avail.|$|E

At the FBI building, he talks to Skinner, hoping for reassurance. He expresses his fear that, despite Tipet being in a coma, Tipet may still be able to enter into his dreams. Skinner, however, dismisses his {{concerns}} and sends him home. While leaving, Doggett has a hallucination of Tipet, ordering him to kill Scully. Suddenly, Doggett finds himself in front of Scully. Rather than kill his partner, he turns the axe upon himself. Doggett is immediately awakened from <b>his</b> <b>dark</b> reverie and finds himself in his bedroom, with Scully standing over his bed. He begins to thank her for saving his life, but she informs him that Tipet died due to his coma.|$|E

5|$|The Overmind is {{the center}} of the Zerg Swarm's hive mind society, created by the Xel'Naga as a single {{consciousness}} for their experiments on the Zerg. It is the antagonist of StarCraft, where it is voiced by Jack Ritschel; Paul Eiding voices the character in Wings of Liberty. At some point during its creation, it was secretly enslaved by the fallen Xel'Naga Amon, who implanted it with a directive to destroy the Protoss and bound the Zerg to a hive mind. The Overmind becomes aware of Xel'Naga, attacking and assimilating its masters. Through this, the Overmind learns of the existence of the Protoss and is determined to assimilate the fellow Xel'Naga-empowered species, believing this will result in perfection. To provide the necessary force to overcome the Protoss, the Overmind targets the psionic potential of the Terrans for assimilation. He also assimilated Sarah Kerrigan so as to create a weapon to free the Zerg from the control of <b>his</b> <b>Dark</b> Master. The Zerg and Protoss clash on various Terran worlds, eventually leading to Zeratul assassinating the cerebrate Zasz. Zasz's death momentarily links the minds of the Overmind and Zeratul, allowing Overmind to learn the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur. The Overmind quickly launches an invasion of Aiur and manifests itself on the planet's surface. Following a lengthy and costly campaign on Aiur, Tassadar harnesses the energies of the dark templar to strike at the Overmind directly, disintegrating it.|$|E
