40|$|According to this report, {{regulatory}} {{reforms are}} needed for the Australian retail industry to adapt successfully to the more globally competitive market in which it now operates. 	There are almost 140 000 retail businesses in Australia, accounting for 4. 1 per cent of GDP and 10. 7 per cent of employment. 	The retail industry exhibits great diversity by: size of business, region, retail format, competition within sectors and {{in the nature of}} goods sold. Both current trading conditions and longer term trends are challenging. Retail sales growth has trended down over the past half decade as consumers save more of their rising incomes and their spending is increasingly directed towards a range of non-retail services. 	The retail industry has met many competitive challenges in the past. Online retailing and the entry of new innovative global retailers are just the latest. The intensified competition is good for consumers, but is challenging for the industry which, as a whole, does not compare favourably in terms of productivity with many overseas countries. And the productivity gap appears to have widened over time. 	Australia also appears to lag a number of comparable countries in its development of online retailing. The Commission 2 ̆ 7 s best estimate is that online retailing represents 6 per cent of total Australian retail sales - made up of 4 per cent domestic online (8. 4 billion) and 2 per cent from overseas (4. 2 billion). In some other countries, online sales figures are higher and set to grow further, as will also happen here. 	Retailers operate under several regulatory regimes that restrict their competitiveness and ability to innovate. Major restrictions which need to be addressed are: 	 		planning and zoning regulations which are complex, excessively prescriptive, and often anticompetitive 		trading hours regulations which restrict the industry 2 ̆ 7 s ability to adapt and compete with online competitors and provide the convenience that consumers want. 	 	 	Workplace relations regulations may not provide sufficient workplace flexibility to facilitate the adoption of best practice productivity measures in the retail industry, and require examination in the reviews scheduled in 2012. 	The current level of the low value threshold (LVT) for exemption from GST and duty on imports of 1000 is judged to be a minor part of the competitive disadvantage faced by retailers. But there are strong in principle grounds for the LVT to be lowered significantly, to promote tax neutrality with domestic sales. However, the Government should not proceed to lower the LVT until it is cost effective to do so. 	The Government should establish a taskforce charged with investigating new approaches to the processing of low value imported parcels, particularly those in the international mail stream, and recommending a new process which would deliver significant improvements and efficiencies in handling without creating delivery delays or other compliance difficulties for importers and consumers. 	Once an improved <b>international</b> <b>parcels</b> process has been designed, the Government should reassess {{the extent to which the}} LVT could be lowered while still remaining cost effective - the costs of raising this additional revenue should be at least broadly comparable to the costs of raising other taxes.

50|$|Domestic {{parcel post}} service was adopted in 1913, 25 {{years after the}} Post Office had agreed to deliver <b>international</b> <b>parcel</b> post {{packages}} pursuant to the Universal Postal Union treaty and various bilateral agreements with other nations. Initially, there were no or few postal regulations governing packages mailed by parcel post.

2500|$|The shambolic {{state of}} {{international}} cricket {{at the end}} of the 1970s was illustrated by the panic resulting from a hastily convened settlement between World Series Cricket and the Australian Board of Control. Although they had visited Australia only twelve months earlier to play for the Ashes, England were persuaded to go there again and play another three Tests, but with the Ashes not at stake. [...] As Wisden put it, the programme did not have the best interests of cricket at heart, particularly Australian cricket below Test level, which had been [...] "swamped by the accent on Test and one-day <b>internationals,</b> neatly <b>parcelled</b> to present a cricketing package suitable for maximum exploitation on television". The matches were widely perceived to be semi-official only and received [...] "a definite thumbs down". Botham was a member of the England team and played in all three matches which, rightly or wrongly, count towards his Test statistics. England were largely faithful to the players who had toured Australia the previous winter and Derek Underwood was the only World Series player they recalled; they did not recall Alan Knott, for example, while Tony Greig was beyond the pale. Australia recalled Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee, Rod Marsh and Jeff Thomson, fielding a team that was a mixture of old and new. In the first match, played at the WACA Ground, Botham had match figures of eleven for 176 but to no avail as Australia won by 138 runs. Having excelled with the ball in that match, Botham did so with his bat in the third one, scoring an unbeaten 119 in the second innings of the third. Australia won all three matches of a series best forgotten for all its attendant politics, but Botham had enhanced his reputation as a world-class all-rounder.|$|R
40|$|It was a {{nice and}} cool evening in October 1958, when {{we were sitting in}} all safety and comfort in the Resthouse at Ranau. The sky had cleared up and Mt Kinabalu {{dominated}} the scenery in all its rugged majesty. Mr D. I. Nicholson, the Ecologist of Sandakan, and I were to start next day to climb the mountain. The preparations had been made, and, lingering around, my eye fell on a booklet on the table. It was ”A Tragedy of Borneo 1941 - 1945 ”, and its subtitle was ”Kinabalu National Memorial Park Project”. While reading, I became deeply impressed. The Tragedy of Borneo began seriously in September 1944. Then the 2400 prisoners, 1800 Australians and 600 Englishmen, who had been kept in a P. O. W. camp at Sandakan, were driven by the Japs westward, into the interior, along a murderous track 150 miles long through the heaviest country, on a daily ration of 2 ½ ounces of rice, while the stores in Sandakan were packed with <b>International</b> Red Cross <b>parcels,</b> and while the American planes came over high in the sky, using the Kinabalu as a land mark, unaware of the terrible things that were happening on the ground. When in August 1945 the death march ended {{at the foot of the}} Kinabalu, the Imperial Army of Japan had massacred all these men, except for six Australians who somehow had managed to escape. While we made the ascent, I saw Mr Nicholson busy collecting data for the setting out of a National Park. This will comprise the summit of the mountain, and a good deal of its slopes. In the booklet, which I was very glad to see now again on my desk, this is explained extensively. For its objective is to seek approval and support for the following aims: ” 1) To commemorate in a more constructive way than War Graves Cemeteries are, by their nature, intended to do, a wartime disaster and recovery of deep national significance to Australia, Great Britain, and British Borneo. 2) To symbolize for posterity the close bonds of friendship, mutual respect, and common endeavour, which have always existed between the British and the indigenous people of Borneo, and which during World War II found frequent and courageous expression throughout the dreadful ordeal through which the country passed. 3) To focus historical interest on Kundasan (4000 ft) near Ranau on the slopes of Mt Kinabalu (13455 ft), the highest mountain in SE. Asia and the most imposing feature in all Borneo. Subject to other conditions being favourable, to work also towards the development of the area for the future benefit of native as well as British interests in Borneo. ...|$|R

50|$|The <b>international</b> <b>parcel</b> service, {{which allowed}} the orderly {{shipment}} of mailed {{packages and parcels}} {{from one country to}} another according to predetermined rates, was established by the Universal Postal Union on 1 October 1881 (Great Britain, India, The Netherlands and Persia, 1 April 1882), following the agreement of 1880 in Paris during a three-week conference on the subject. The service was difficult to introduce as in several countries the carriage of parcels was a monopoly of the railway companies, and Egypt, Great Britain, India, Canada and Italy all initially claimed that there was no parcel service in their country.|$|E
50|$|Parcel Post service {{began with}} the {{introduction}} of <b>International</b> <b>Parcel</b> Post between the USA and foreign countries in 1887. That same year, the U.S. Post Office (predecessor of the USPS) and the Postmaster General of Canada established parcel-post service between the two nations. A bilateral parcel-post treaty between the independent (at the time) Kingdom of Hawaii and the USA was signed on 19 December 1888 and put into effect early in 1889. Parcel-post service between the USA and other countries grew with the signing of successive postal conventions and treaties. While the Post Office agreed to deliver parcels sent into the country under the UPU treaty, it did not institute a domestic parcel-post service for another twenty-five years.|$|E

50|$|It {{was also}} in 1913, in January, that the Post Office {{introduced}} domestic parcel post service (a belated development, given that <b>international</b> <b>parcel</b> post service between the United States and other countries began in 1887). A series of twelve Parcel Post stamps intended for this service had already been released in December 1912, ranging in denomination from 1¢ to $1. All were printed in red and designed in the wide Columbian format. The eight lowest values illustrated aspects of mail handling and delivery, while higher denominations depicted such industries as Manufacturing, Dairying and Fruit Growing. Five green Parcel Post Postage Due stamps appeared concurrently. It soon became obvious {{that none of these}} stamps was needed: parcel postage could easily be paid by definitive or commemorative issues, and normal postage due stamps were sufficient for parcels. When original stocks ran out, no reprints appeared, nor were replacements for either group ever contemplated. However, one denomination introduced in the Parcel Post series—20¢ - had proved useful, and the Post Office added this value to the Washington-Franklin issues in 1914, along with a 30¢ stamp.|$|E
5000|$|Nkhata Bay is {{described}} by Lonely Planet as [...] "Caribbeanesque" [...] and a [...] "lush tropical indent". There are several guesthouses and lodges for tourists in Nkhata Bay. In February 2005, the Malawian government announced plans to build ecolodges {{as a way of}} increasing ecotourism in the Nkhata Bay area. The diving school in Nkhata Bay offers the [...] "cheapest diving course in the world" [...] according to The Daily Telegraph. Nkhata Bay tourism has a long history. It {{has been part of the}} overland backpackers route between east Africa and cape town but the number of backpackers have dropped considerably in recent years. Political issues in Zimbabwe has revised the overland backpacking route so that many people now go through Zambia or the Mozambique coast. The Heart Hotel was a local owned establishment in the local village where very low budget backpackers could get a room and breakfast for well under one US dollar. Nkhata Bay became a place where people could rest on a long trip and spend very little money. With the opening of Njajay Lodge the scene changed a little. The town along with backpackers culture shifted to catering to a traveller with more money to spend. While the village now has many places to stay the problem has become attracting people who now often travel though other countries or more easier accessed beaches in Malawi. Another shift that has reduced the amount of foreign visitors to Nkhata Bay is the increasing number of people travelling Africa by overland truck rather than independent backpackers travel. Overland trucks to do not come to Nkhata Bay but instead choose the beaches on Chinteche to the south. As a result, many of the local artists have moved their craft stalls to the Nkhata Bay/Chinteche road junction. This along with huge increases in <b>international</b> <b>parcel</b> rates from Malawi have made it increasing difficult for the talented local artist to make a living. Many artists now set up stalls directly outside of overland truck camps around Malawi understanding that backpackers can no longer afford to send famous Malawi chief chairs and masks home.|$|E
