5|$|As Boyce's {{interest}} in philanthropy grew, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> childhood {{experiences in the}} outdoors as a resource, but {{could not find a}} way to channel his charitable ideas and dreams until a fateful stop to England while en route to what became the failed photographic expedition to Africa. Events in London on the way to and from this expedition would lead to the founding of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), one of many civic and professional organizations formed during the Progressive Era to fill the void of citizens who had become distended from their rural roots. Many youth organizations such as the Woodcraft Indians and Sons of Daniel Boone formed in America in the early 1900s focusing on outdoor character-building activities. The writings and adventures of Theodore Roosevelt contributed to these movements, with their outdoor, nature, and pioneer themes. By the time of his 1922 expedition to Africa, Boyce was so well respected in Scouting that French Boy Scouts in Algeria saluted him and offered to escort him along a trail when they found out he was the founder of BSA and LSA in America.|$|E

As the proposal delivered by the magistrate failed to impress the king, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> favourite architect in 1584, and Boy finally had a proposal ready which pleased the king by 1589. The simple and narrow spire lasted until lightning destroyed it in 1835.|$|E

Burnett requested a change of venue for the court proceedings, and during transportation to the next venue, the defendants escaped.|$|E
25|$|James Robinson was a {{shipwright}} at Pallion in Sunderland, whose wife, Hannah, {{had recently}} died. He hired Mary Ann as a housekeeper in November 1866. A month later, when James' baby, John, died of gastric fever, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> housekeeper for comfort {{and she became}} pregnant. Then Mary Ann's mother, living in Seaham Harbour, County Durham, became ill with hepatitis, so she immediately went to her. Although her mother began to recover, she also began to complain of stomach pains. She died at age 54 {{in the spring of}} 1867, nine days after Mary Ann's arrival. In 1867, Mary Ann's stepfather George Stott married his widowed neighbour, Hannah Paley.|$|E
25|$|After Brown left, Earl Temple, who had {{inherited}} Stowe from his uncle Lord Cobham, {{turned to a}} garden designer called Richard Woodward, who had been gardener at Wotton House, the Earl's previous home. The work of naturalising the landscape started by Brown was continued under Woodward and was accomplished by the mid-1750s. At the same time Earl Temple {{turned his attention to}} the various temples and monuments. He altered several of Vanburgh's and Gibbs's temples to make them conform to his taste for Neoclassical architecture. To accomplish this he employed Giovanni Battista Borra from 1752 to 1756. Also at this time several monuments were moved to other parts of the garden. Earl Temple made further alterations in the gardens from the early 1760s. This is when several of the older structures were demolished and this time <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> cousin Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Camelford who was assisted by Borra, whose most notable design was the Corinthian Arch.|$|E

25|$|In 1967, Stewart's wife fell in {{love with}} one of his best friends, Norman, and so he granted her a divorce, but {{remained}} both her and Norman's friend, carrying no resentment towards them. Feeling alone, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> second wife, Jean Mackinlay, who herself had just recently divorced her second husband, and although she refused his offer of reigniting their relationship, they did once more become friends. In 1968 he would re-united with another former lover, Beth Donovan, and married her, but he would leave her in June 1969 when he met a new woman, Isabel Sutherland, and subsequently moved in with her and her daughter. Meanwhile, in 1968 he won a Writer’s Guild Award for his six-part radio serial Watch the Wall my Darling, which was based upon the poem A Smuggler's Song by one of his favourite poets, Rudyard Kipling. Following this, in February of the following year, he once more returned to journalism, taking up employment with the popular weekly magazine Reveille.|$|E
500|$|He {{wrote in}} January 1949 {{that he was}} working on a [...] "book of psychology" [...] about [...] "the cause and cure of nervous tension", which he was going to call The Dark Sword, Excalibur or Science of the Mind. In April 1949, Hubbard wrote to several {{professional}} organizations to offer his research. None were interested, so <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> editor John W. Campbell, who was more receptive due to a long-standing fascination with fringe psychologies and psychic powers ("psionics") that [...] "permeated both his fiction and non-fiction".|$|E

Spielberg sent Gottlieb a script, asking what the writer would change {{and if there was}} a role he would be {{interested}} in performing. Gottlieb sent Spielberg three pages of notes, and picked the part of Meadows, the politically connected editor of the local paper. He passed the audition one week before Spielberg took him to meet the producers regarding a writing job.|$|E

500|$|Fielding {{began writing}} Amelia {{in the autumn}} of 1749. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own life for inspiration, and the main character, Amelia, was {{possibly}} modelled on Fielding's first wife, Charlotte, who died in November 1744. Likewise, the hero, Captain Booth, was partly modelled after Fielding himself. It was advertised on 2 December 1751 by the publisher, Andrew Millar, in The General Advertiser. In it, Millar claimed that [...] "to satisfy the earnest Demand of the Publick, this Work is now printing at four Presses; but the Proprietor not-withstanding finds it impossible to get them bound in Time without spoiling the Beauty of the Impression, and therefore will sell them sew'd at Half a Guinea a Sett." ...|$|E

500|$|Edinburgh was {{a leading}} European centre of {{anatomical}} study in the early 19th century, {{in a time when}} the demand for cadavers led to a shortfall in legal supply. Scottish law required that corpses used for medical research should only come from those who had died in prison, suicide victims, or from [...] and orphans. The shortage of corpses led to an increase in [...] grave robbing by what were known as resurrection men. Measures to ensure graves were left undisturbed exacerbated the shortage. When a lodger in Hare's house died, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> friend Burke for advice and they decided to sell the body to Knox. They received what was, for them, the generous sum of £7 10s. A little over two months later, when Hare was concerned that a lodger suffering from fever would deter others from staying in the house, he and Burke murdered her and sold the body to Knox. The men continued their murder spree, probably with the knowledge of their wives. Burke and Hare's actions were uncovered after other lodgers discovered their last victim, Margaret Docherty, and called the police.|$|E

500|$|Grant was {{personally}} honest with money matters. However, {{he was extremely}} careless with his associates. [...] Historian C.

[...] Grant himself had been educated and trained at West Point in subjects as conduct, French, mathematics, artillery, cavalry tactics, and infantry. He {{had come from a}} humble background where men of superior intelligence and ability were threats rather than assets.

500|$|Losing {{the court}} case proved devastating for Lucan. It had cost him an {{estimated}} £20,000, and by late 1974 his financial position was dire. As he drank more heavily and started chain-smoking, his friends began to worry. [...] In drunken conversations {{with some of}} them, including Aspinall's mother, Lady Osborne, and her son, Lucan discussed murdering his wife. Greville Howard later gave {{a statement to the}} police describing how Lucan had talked of how killing his wife might save him from bankruptcy, how her body might be disposed of in the Solent and how he [...] "would never be caught". Lucan borrowed £4,000 from his mother and asked Marcia Tucker for a loan of £100,000. Having no luck there, he wrote to Tucker's son, explaining how he wished to [...] "buy" [...] his children from Veronica; the money was not forthcoming. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> friends and acquaintances, asking anyone plausible to loan him money to fund his gambling addiction. The financier James Goldsmith guaranteed a £5,000 overdraft for him, which for years remained unpaid. Lucan also applied to the discreet Edgware Trust. On request, he supplied details of his income, which was apparently around £12,000 a year from various family trusts. He was required to provide a surety and received only £3,000 of the £5,000 he asked for. Much to their managers' consternation, his four bank accounts were overdrawn; Coutts, £2,841; Lloyds, £4,379; National Westminster, £1,290; Midland, £5,667. Even though by then he was playing for much lower stakes than had previously been the case, Lucan's gambling remained completely out of control. Ranson (1994) estimates that between September and October 1974 alone, the earl ran up debts of around £50,000.|$|E
