5|$|Finely divided {{neptunium}} metal {{presents a}} fire hazard because neptunium is pyrophoric; small grains will <b>ignite</b> spontaneously in air at room temperature.|$|E
50|$|The {{animatronics}} {{start off}} at certain locations in your house. e.g. <b>Ignited</b> Freddy starts within the closet {{in front of}} you. <b>Ignited</b> Chica starts within the left closet. <b>Ignited</b> Bonnie starts within the hallway to your right. And <b>Ignited</b> Foxy starts off at the balcony behind your back. You have to use your hearing and sight-seeing skills to survive the animatronics for a long amount of time.|$|R
50|$|The solid {{propellant}} is <b>ignited</b> by a coated wire inserted through the nozzle and {{in contact with}} the propellant. An electric current heats the wire and <b>ignites</b> the {{solid propellant}}. An engine can also be <b>ignited</b> by the hot gases from the propellant of a booster engine.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the trigger}} is pulled, a firing pin <b>ignites</b> the primer, which then <b>ignites</b> a powder booster charge that pushes the bullet into the barrel. The solid block of {{propellant}} is broken up {{to increase the}} ignition surface area and <b>ignites,</b> accelerating the bullet out of the barrel.|$|R

5|$|Luminosity – <b>Ignite</b> the Night! is a dance, fireworks, and {{pyrotechnics}} {{show for}} all ages performed nightly on the Celebration Plaza stage.|$|E
5|$|The Celebration Plaza Stage is in Celebration Plaza {{in front}} of the Iron Dragon. It was built for the 2012 season as part of Luminosity– <b>Ignite</b> the Night! and {{replaced}} a giant screen used for Hot Summer Lights.|$|E
50|$|To begin a {{production}} run, called a 'cupola campaign', the furnace {{is filled with}} layers of coke and <b>ignited</b> with torches. Some smaller cupolas may be <b>ignited</b> with wood to start the coke burning. When the coke is <b>ignited,</b> air is introduced to the coke bed through ports in the sides called tuyeres.|$|R
50|$|For {{stars with}} masses greater than 10.3 solar masses, oxygen <b>ignites</b> {{in the core}} or not at all. Similarly, for stars with a mass of less than 9 solar masses (without {{accretion}} of additional mass) oxygen <b>ignites</b> in the core or not at all. However, in the 9-10.3 solar mass range, oxygen <b>ignites</b> off-center.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the first}} stage is cleared, the second-stage motor <b>ignites</b> and burns for {{approximately}} 65 seconds. The nose fairing is then jettisoned, separating from the missile. When the nose fairing is cleared of the missile, the third-stage TVC subsystem <b>ignites,</b> and ordnance separates the second-stage motor. The third-stage motor then <b>ignites,</b> pushing the equipment section the remaining distance (approx. 40 seconds) of the flight. When the third-stage motor reaches the targeted area, the Post Boost Control System (PBCS) <b>ignites,</b> and the third-stage motor is ejected.|$|R
5|$|When {{placed over}} a flame, lithium {{compounds}} give off a striking crimson color, {{but when it}} burns strongly the flame becomes a brilliant silver. Lithium will <b>ignite</b> and burn in oxygen when exposed to water or water vapors. Lithium is flammable, and it is potentially explosive when exposed to air and especially to water, though less so than the other alkali metals. The lithium-water reaction at normal temperatures is brisk but nonviolent because the hydrogen produced does not <b>ignite</b> on its own. As with all alkali metals, lithium fires are difficult to extinguish, requiring dry powder fire extinguishers (Class D type). Lithium {{is one of the}} few metals that react with nitrogen under normal conditions.|$|E
5|$|All {{actinides}} are pyrophoric, {{especially when}} finely divided, that is, they spontaneously <b>ignite</b> upon reaction with air. The melting point of actinides {{does not have}} a clear dependence on the number of f-electrons. The unusually low melting point of neptunium and plutonium (~640°C) is explained by hybridization of 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in these metals.|$|E
5|$|An oil tanker's {{inert gas}} system {{is one of}} the most {{important}} parts of its design. Fuel oil itself is very difficult to <b>ignite,</b> but its hydrocarbon vapors are explosive when mixed with air in certain concentrations. The purpose of the system is to create an atmosphere inside tanks in which the hydrocarbon oil vapors cannot burn.|$|E
50|$|USDOL {{concluded}} that the initiation mode of the fire was undetermined. It stated that smoking, sparking of electrical equipment, or frictionally <b>ignited</b> gas are among the probable <b>igniting</b> sources.|$|R
50|$|Atlas IIAS {{was largely}} {{identical}} to IIA, but added four Castor 4A solid rocket boosters to increase performance. These boosters were <b>ignited</b> in pairs, with one pair <b>igniting</b> on the ground, {{and the second}} <b>igniting</b> in the air shortly after the first pair separated. The half-stage booster section would then drop off as usual. IIAS was used between 1993 and 2004, concurrently with IIA.|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} the {{wildfires}} was the Big Horn Fire, which <b>ignited</b> on May 13. Three other minor wildfires <b>ignited</b> subsequently, but were extinguished by May 17. On May 20, the Avocado Fire <b>ignited</b> in Fresno County, only to be extinguished 2 days later. On May 22, 2008, the human-caused Summit Fire {{broke out in the}} Santa Cruz Mountains, which became the first major fire.|$|R
5|$|Early {{experiments}} with floating petroleum {{on the sea}} and igniting it were not entirely successful: the fuel was difficult to <b>ignite,</b> large quantities were required to cover even modest areas and the weapon was easily disrupted by waves. However, the potential was clear. By early 1941 a flame barrage technique was developed. Rather than attempting to <b>ignite</b> oil floating on water, nozzles were placed above high-water mark with pumps producing sufficient pressure to spray fuel which produced a roaring wall of flame over, rather than on, the water. Such installations consumed considerable resources and although this weapon was impressive, its network of pipes was vulnerable to pre-landing bombardment; General Brooke did not consider it effective. Initially ambitious plans were cut back to cover {{just a few miles}} of beaches.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} Tiangong Kaiwu (The Exploitation of the Works of Nature) treatise, written by Song Yingxing in 1637, the ox bladder {{described}} by Jiao Yu is {{replaced with a}} lacquer bag and a cord pulled from a hidden ambusher located on the nearby shore, which would release a flint steel–wheel firing mechanism to <b>ignite</b> the fuse of the naval mine.|$|E
5|$|Iridium in bulk {{metallic}} form is not biologically {{important or}} hazardous to health {{due to its}} lack of reactivity with tissues; {{there are only about}} 20parts per trillion of iridium in human tissue. Like most metals, finely divided iridium powder can be hazardous to handle, as it is an irritant and may <b>ignite</b> in air.|$|E
5000|$|Early primer {{was simply}} fine {{gunpowder}} poured into a pan or tube {{where it could}} be <b>ignited</b> by some external source of ignition such as a fuse or a spark. Modern primers are shock sensitive chemicals enclosed in a small (a few mm) capsule, <b>ignited</b> by percussion. In some instance ignition is electricity-primed, and there may even be no primer at all in such design (the propellant being directly <b>ignited).</b>|$|R
5000|$|At least initially, the {{boosters}} {{and core}} stage {{would use the}} pyrotechnically <b>ignited</b> 14D22 (RD-107A) and 14D23 (RD-108A) rather than the chemically <b>ignited</b> 14D22 kHz and 14D23 kHz used {{on the rest of}} the Soyuz-2.|$|R
5000|$|The powder <b>ignites,</b> and {{the flash}} {{passes through a}} small hole in the barrel (called a vent or touchhole) {{that leads to the}} {{combustion}} chamber where it <b>ignites</b> the main powder charge, and the gun discharges.|$|R
5|$|Metallic {{plutonium}} {{is produced}} by reacting plutonium tetrafluoride with barium, calcium or lithium at 1200°C. It is attacked by acids, oxygen, and steam but not by alkalis and dissolves easily in concentrated hydrochloric, hydroiodic and perchloric acids. Molten metal must be kept in a vacuum or an inert atmosphere to avoid reaction with air. At 135°C the metal will <b>ignite</b> in air and will explode if placed in carbon tetrachloride.|$|E
5|$|This {{fire was}} {{responsible}} for the loss of most of the silent films produced by Fox Film Corporation before 1932. Also destroyed were Educational Pictures negatives and films of several other studios. It brought attention to the potential for decaying nitrate film to spontaneously <b>ignite,</b> and changed the focus of film preservation efforts to include a greater focus on fire safety.|$|E
5|$|Thorium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Th and atomic number 90. Thorium metal is silvery and tarnishes black {{when it is}} exposed to air, forming the dioxide; it is moderately hard, malleable, and has a high melting point. Thorium is an electropositive actinide whose chemistry {{is dominated by the}} +4 oxidation state; it is quite reactive and can <b>ignite</b> in air when finely divided.|$|E
5000|$|A {{vertical}} launch {{system can}} be either hot launch, where the missile <b>ignites</b> in the cell, or cold launch, where the missile is expelled by gas produced by a gas generator which {{is not part of}} the missile itself, and then the missile <b>ignites.</b> [...] "Cold" [...] means relatively cold compared with rocket engine exhaust. A hot launch system does not require an ejection mechanism, but does require some way of disposing of the missile's exhaust and heat as it leaves the cell. If the missile <b>ignites</b> in a cell without an ejection mechanism, the cell must withstand the tremendous heat generated without <b>igniting</b> the missiles in the adjacent cells.|$|R
2500|$|The gunner {{pulled the}} lanyard which <b>ignited</b> a {{gunpowder}} {{charge in the}} vent tube, the flash passed through the vent in the vent-piece, assisted by the primer if present, into the powder chamber and <b>ignited</b> the gunpowder charge ...|$|R
50|$|The gun {{operated}} using {{a standard}} flintlock mechanism, with the priming gunpowder <b>igniting</b> the central charge via a small vent. When the flash reached the central chamber, all seven charges <b>ignited</b> at once, firing {{more or less}} simultaneously.|$|R
5|$|X-Men had {{its premiere}} at Ellis Island on July 12, 2000, {{two days before}} a wide opening in 3,025theaters in North America. It would also debut in Australia that weekend to take {{advantage}} of the school holidays, while most other territories would get the film in August. Marvel Studios was depending on X-Mens success to <b>ignite</b> other franchise properties (Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Hulk, and Daredevil).|$|E
5|$|A non-safety fougasse {{could be}} built by simply burying the {{propelling}} charge behind the fuel drum and running leads through the soil. Instructions for several variants of this design were published but this construction increases the hazard because the leads {{would have to be}} left exposed on the surface and any electrical current applied could, theoretically, <b>ignite</b> the charge. Also, underground moisture could also easily ruin the charge {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|Chemists at the Los Alamos Laboratory {{developed}} {{methods of}} purifying uranium and plutonium, the latter a metal that only existed in microscopic quantities when Project Y began. Its metallurgists found that plutonium had unexpected properties, but were nonetheless able to cast it into metal spheres. The laboratory built the Water Boiler, an aqueous homogeneous reactor, the third reactor {{in the world}} to become operational. It also researched the Super, a hydrogen bomb that would use a fission bomb to <b>ignite</b> a nuclear fusion reaction in deuterium and tritium.|$|E
5000|$|The gunner {{pulled the}} lanyard which <b>ignited</b> a {{gunpowder}} {{charge in the}} vent tube, the flash passed through the vent in the vent-piece, assisted by the primer if present, into the powder chamber and <b>ignited</b> the gunpowder charge ...|$|R
50|$|Earlier {{forms of}} the {{detonator}} employed a vial of sulfuric acid surrounded by a mixture of potassium perchlorate and sugar. When the vial was crushed, the acid <b>ignited</b> the perchlorate-sugar mix, and the resulting flame <b>ignited</b> the gunpowder charge.|$|R
5000|$|... 1660s: In 1660, {{lightning}} <b>ignited</b> the gunpowder magazine at Osaka Castle, Japan; {{the resultant}} explosion set the castle on fire. In 1665, lightning again terminated {{on the main}} tower of the castle, <b>igniting</b> a fire which subsequently burned it to its foundation.|$|R
