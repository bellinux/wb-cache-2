These visual outcomes are conceived with different aims: firstly, by making the invisible visible, environmental maps can be used for communication purposes; secondly, visuals serve as observation devices to assess and interpret phenomena in space, enabling geo-referred considerations which would not be possible by referring to mere numerical outputs only; thirdly, they can be used as design tools to affect decision making in order to improve existing conditions or future performance of places (environmental simulation) ...|$|E

40|$|The city {{space is}} a place of endless possibilities, a vast web of {{intersecting}} paths, peoples and times, that is at once an unknown, foreign country to be discovered, as well as an intimately familiar dwelling. It provides its inhabitants with the potential for feeling both at ease and unsettled, rooted but lost, hidden yet exposed, as somebody or nobody. Both Paul Auster in his novel City of Glass and Wim Wenders in his film Lisbon Story explore this indeterminate urban space through characters whose identities draw upon and are affected by the city and what exists therein. In the chaotic urban landscape, Auster’s and Wenders’ protagonists take to roaming the labyrinth of streets, in an effort to immerse themselves completely in the city and experience its ‘true’ nature. In order to achieve this, they believe they must first efface themselves, lose their sense of self, which results in an aimless journey to become nobody. Nevertheless, in both City of Glass and Lisbon Story, the protagonists find themselves eventually attempting to make some semblance of sense of what they are perceiving around them. Either by taking notes on the city, through the filming of it or by recording its sounds, Quinn, Monroe, Winter (the characters in Auster’s and Wenders’ works), and even the <b>invisible</b> <b>character</b> of the Portuguese modernist poet Fernando Pessoa, attempt to decipher space as they navigate it, while simultaneously relying on it as a source of inspiration for finding, creating and asserting their own existence and some form of identity...|$|E
40|$|Our {{modern and}} {{contemporary}} architecture {{has been greatly}} engaged with the visual aspects of space often excluding the non-material dimensions that create overall the atmosphere {{and the experience of}} space. Architecture is not only the images we see, but in fact a multidimensional experience, which goes beyond the visible. From this perspective to space my research question was formulated as: how can the characteristic and qualities of sound become an alternative way of mapping, interpreting and designing space? The way I approached my research on sound and space in relation to architecture is based on the theory of B. Blesser and L_R. Salter in the combination of R. Ganchrow. All architecture theoreticians dealing with the relation of sound and space, suggests that in the perception of sound the observer is the vantage point, the center of space, and from this point sound is able to deform and distort the perceived space. In the Aural Architecture: The <b>invisible</b> <b>character</b> of space, Blesser and Salter theorize the aural arenas that shaped around the observer, who is the center of space. They emphasize that the materiality of the physical space is able to reconfigure our aural arena. They suggest that sound interacting with reflecting surfaces acts like amplifiers of the aural space, while absorbing materials shrink our acoustic arenas. Based on this and on the deformable character of sound mentioned by Ganchrow, it is arguable that sound interacting with reflective material expends while absorption shrinks the physical limitation of the space as perceived by the observer. One example of applying this theory is by a mapping started with decomposing the space first into elements that produce sound and second to architectural elements that influence the character of sound, such as materials that reflect (amplify) and absorb, producing a wide catalog. This is followed by breaking down the site into spatial compositions - from narrow to wide spaces which influence the character of sound. From all the inventory mappings, what interested me is how sound interacts with space and how it is able to transform the perceived space by reflection and absorption (similarly to vision) which was tested to represent by different mapping methods such as transcriptions, photograph, collage, spatial narratives, and experimental perspectives. As a conclusion of the research, on a social level sound is an emotive medium of space. It influences the perception of space and it shapes or deforms social relationships. Sound is also a performativity medium of space (city) that is shaped by its inhabitants and belongs to its inhabitants. Another important spatial aspect of sound can be found in its interactive character. Sound interacts not only with the observer, but also with the space itself. Sound by nature belongs to space and therefore to architecture. Sound in space adds multiple dimensions to the built environment such as time, movement (though reverberation) and rhythm. By those characteristics sound is bonded with architecture. Border ConditionsPublic BuildingArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|E

It is probable that hardly a change of any kind affects either parent, without some mark being left on the germ. But on the doctrine of reversion, as given in this chapter, the germ becomes a far more marvellous object, for, besides the visible changes which it undergoes, we must believe that it is crowded with <b>invisible</b> <b>characters,</b> proper to both sexes, to both the right and left side of the body, and to a long line of male and female ancestors separated by hundreds or even thousands of generations from the present time: and these characters, like those written on paper with invisible ink, lie ready to be evolved whenever the organisation is disturbed by certain known or unknown conditions.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to explore why the Danes {{do not have a}} more {{environmental}} friendly be-haviour as they actually express {{that it is important to}} protect the environment. There seems to be a gab between what people say and what they do. I therefore ask the following cardinal question: What are the reasons for the skisma between the Danes’ attitude on environ-mental problems and their actual actions? – And how can this skisma be investi-gated? In order to explore and answer the cardinal question I examine both existing empirical and theoretical material. The empirical material is constituted of quantitative and qualitative re-search. I first exemplify the skisma by looking at how Danes act in relation to three examples: transportation, organic foods and waste, and go on to analyze and discuss the value of the quantitative and qualitative method, which are the commonly used methods to investigate peo-ple’s environmental viewpoints and -behaviour. The answer to the second part of the cardinal question is that the quantitative method can provide an overview of people’s environmental attitudes and actions and not much else, whereas the qualitative method can help to explain why people act as they do. The three examples show that people have an environmental friendly behaviour in relation to waste but that it is very limited when it comes to transportation and organic foods. Furthermore they clarify that environmental behaviour is deeply ambivalent and rooted in everyday life. This outcome is further explored as I move on to three theoretical viewpoints related to envi-ronmental problems and as I take a closer look at everyday life. Part of understanding why peoples opinion on environmental subjects does not cohere with their actions, is related to the <b>invisible</b> <b>character</b> of the environmental problems. This makes them difficult for people to relate to and act on. In spite of this the responsibility for environmental problems is to an increasing extent placed on the consumers. This makes everyday life important to examine. Societal structures however do also play a part as there is constant interaction between society and everyday life. As a consequence there are several factors that influence if people act environ-mental friendly or not. One of these factors is that it must be possible and easy to act in an environmental friendly way. This is however rarely the case. It is often too difficult and demand-ing to act environmental friendly. People act rational according to their own life. At the moment it does not seem rational to them to act environmental friendly in their everyday life. It is more expensive and takes up more time. In other words people are not motivated and it does not make sense to them because they have to go out of their way to show consideration for the environment. Furthermore there is no social demand on environmental friendly behaviour, only on an environmental friendly attitude...|$|E

I make use of a contextualized close reading of five of Auster’s novels and attempt a hermeneutic interpretation of these novels to arrive at a hermeneutic circle when combining these novels into an integrated whole, individual, work of fiction. Certain parallels can be drawn between Auster’s various novels and these parallels contribute to the various motifs and themes found throughout his work. The importance of space in Auster’s novels is also highlighted with emphasis on liminality which serves as an instigator for transgression to occur between different fictive worlds. Master...|$|R

These movies aim to present class division in Chile and Brazil with the maid as narrative and make the maid visible. However, this thesis argues that maids are a little visible with their presence in movies, but unheard.
